I ordered The Monterey, I also was not disappointed. We both inhaled our crepes and couldn't wait for dessert! This place is trendy in general, infused water, hand salt scrub in the bathroom for example.  Can't beat the price for such deliciousness.  Also; they have a camera over the kitchen for customers to watch the magic happening and I think that is pretty neat!!  The perfect combination- amazing! Not too sweet. Very fresh. The chocolate isn't overpowering and they give you a generous mound of whipped cream.   If we lived in LV, we would be regulars here!!!",

    "text": "Bun and I were never able to make it here before closing.. but last week we were!  We stopped by around 1pm and it was a full house. There's a couple tables outside for outdoor dining available but since it was windy we decided to stick with sitting in the inside.   This place is a fast casual type of restaurant - no waiter service and you pay when you order and then servers bring you the food. Self-serve iced cucumber water and lemon water are available too.    Bun got the La Jolla (popular among Yelpers) and I got the Caprese. Total was about $14-$15, per crepe is at least $7.50. Both crepes were good but nothing outstanding or extraordinary. The La Jolla comes with the chipotle sauce while the Caprese comes with a Pesto. It's a light breakfast where it'll fill you up if it's the first thing you eat. Unfortunately though, I think all the ingredients for the crepe are all easy ingredients you could probably make it yourself at home - tomato, lettuce, mozzarella cheese. The presentation was pretty basic too - folding it in half then the corners in (I assume having corners faced on the plate would look better but that's just my opinion)  The soup that comes with the crepe, what I think it taste like - top ramen soup powder mixed with water. that's not to say it taste bad because it didn't, but that's just what I can compare its taste to. While sitting at the bar, Bun and I got to see crepes being made - I understand it's delicate and it was weird because there was one employee who tore every other crepe she was making haha  I know 3 stars seem really low but I guess with all 5 star ratings, I expected more. But don't get me wrong, I will be back.",

The what I am assuming is the manager, an older man with awesome tattoos- guides you to your tables, shows you how to order, asks you how you're doing. Totally sets the vibe up for a great experience, which it always is!  It sometimes is very very crowded, so you will most likely be sitting close to another party. Which I don't really mind, because the food is just so good.  They have all different types of crepes, savory, sweet, veggie. Which for me is so important because I am vegetarian and my options are very limited at times. But with this place I can literally order half of the menu if I wanted.   Definitely give them a try, they are such an awesome place for brunch! :)",

I have been coming here with my girlfriends every weekend or every other since it opened and I have to write a review in hopes that the owners read this about how horrible their customer service has gone down. I only took away 2 STARS for the service/atmosphere.  The porters/servers are still wonderful and hustle to make sure everyone is happy and has hot food, but the standing in line to give your name and be crammed in a hallway to sit is horrible. The owner who runs the register is yelling out names and barking orders to the staff in every direction it's hard to enjoy the atmosphere. Let's no reinvent the wheel here let's get a host stand and a server to take the orders and call it a day. The Panera bread table number system clearly is not working any longer since the popularity boom, so I hope this review is taken as constructive, because I want to enjoy my Crepe place again!",

He runs weekly/monthly specials that are excellent.  Everything is made to order in a kitchen that is mostly visible from the dining room.  Arrive with about 20 minutes to spare, and watch your whole order get made in front of you.  Even if you get it to go, it stays really nice and hot for about 20 minutes to bring it home.  If you plan on going during the busy hours, you might prefer takeout to make sure you've got a spot to sit.  The staff does a great job of remembering their clientele, so make sure to introduce yourself by name.  They're only open for breakfast and lunch, so get out of the house early.",

The usual sin is to offer so many choices it takes ten minutes to file through the selections, some times you even find burgers and sandwiches interlaced among the crepes. No burgers here thankfully, just about ten options for both sweet and savory crepes each ingredient combination well selected.   There is the elephant in the room, that is the room itself. While not wholly untasteful it will make most heterosexual males squirm. Man up though because this has the potential to be the best date spot for a budding relationship.

It was packed, and there is no place to stand during your wait except outside in the heat. It didn't take too long to get seated, but then we had to share one table with 2 other parties which wasn't ideal and kind of awkward.  After we had ordered, it took about 15 minutes for them to bring my husband's diet coke to the table. And you have to go get the water yourself with paper cups. On top of that, it is so full in the tiny location that you bump into a few people just to get to the water.  The worst part is how terribly hot the location is in the summer. People were fanning themselves waiting for food and we were sweating. The staff said that the grills are so hot and the door keeps opening and closing because of the patio that they cannot keep it cool even after having someone check the AC a few times. I guess there is nothing that can be done about it in this location, but it's kind of miserable.  Overall, the food was really good and reasonably priced. But we were so hot, we couldn't even sit there and enjoy it because we just wanted to get to the air conditioning. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon. I can find good food somewhere where there is air conditioning and we have our own table.",

A bit of an odd space, dim lighting and dark wood beneath big screen televisions orders are placed at the counter and arriving just as the restaurant opened our order of three thin pancakes was expedited on the open kitchen's three stones with each arriving soft on the interior with the slightest browning adding textbook chew enveloping bold, balanced ingredients.  With prices a bit higher than the majority of creperies Stateside or abroad but service and ingredient quality equally elevated it was with a sweet, a savory, and a special that our morning passed and although my tastes veered toward the complexity of the Avalon it would be hard to argue against the Elvis or the Greek, the former pure decadence with added whipped cream and the later finding balance for the slightly oversalted chicken in the punchy yogurt.",

Then a couple next to us who had never been there before either let us know we had to go to the counter to order. That and the fact that it was uncomfortably cozy are the reason for the 4 stars. We could here the whole conversation of the table next to us which wasn't pleasant. But, all of the food was fantastic!! I ordered the Sonora and it was yummy!

The Avalon and the Monterey are good choices. The only reason I wouldn't give this place five stars is because of the lack of space & limited capacity. If you visit during the weekend, go after they first open or right before they close. Otherwise, you might literally be fighting other people over tables. I've had people steal tables right from under me several times during busier visits.",

I would recommend to anyone, especially if you are gluten free and have been craving items of a gluteny nature!",

Personally, I think the savory options are a bit better than the sweet ones, but the menu is large enough to find something for everyone.   The Frisco (blueberries, lemon curd, whipped cream, powdered sugar) was better than expected, particularly the lemon curd, but the whipped cream didn't seem particularly fresh and didn't have much flavor. The Sonora is one of the most-recommended options here, and it's easily one of the best crepes I've had, with carne asada, guac, cheese, and just a touch of salsa- it also comes with a tasty little bowl of soup.   I'm not a fan of the tall high-top style tables or the large community-style table hogging the majority of the floor space, but the crepe bar seating is fun and there's even a camera above the griddle to watch how they are made. If you're a mimosa fan, they have a flight with three fruit-flavored options that are all exceptionally good.",

The upside:  It's worth a twenty minute cab ride from the strip.  Located in a strip mall, we were a little wary when we arrived but we left full and happy.   We were seated outside on a beautiful day after we placed our order at the register.  They offer free lemon and cucumber water inside the restaurant.  Our waiter was very attentive and kept checking on us to see if we needed anything.   The food is delicious and cooked to order.  I had The Sonora which was Carne Asada steak roasted tomato salsa, guacamole and jack cheese with a salad.  The crepe was pretty big and filled with steak that was nicely cooked (not chewy) and well seasoned.  I was stuffed by the end of my meal.  The crepe and an ice tea set me back by $12.50 - a bargain for such deliciousness.  If I was staying longer I would have gone back to try one of their other crepes as I'm sure they were just as good.   If you're in the Las Vegas area - jump in a cab and check out this restaurant.  You won't be disappointed.",

It's kind of weird how you have to order your food and pay first before you're even guaranteed that tables are available for you right away.  I've gone here a few times and I have always loved how my crepes came out. I usually get a breakfast crepe as they are more filling to me, with The Monterey being my favorite minus the bacon but add mushrooms to give it more flavor. I've also tried The Ana Banana Foster and it was pretty good to me; it was a little too sweet, but it was good nonetheless. Next time I visit, I will have to try new things on their menu and see what else they have to offer.  While I've always had a pretty good experience here, my last visit was a little less than stellar. There was a miscommunication with my sister and their cashier, and my sister was pretty much accused of lying. When my brother and my sister explained to me what happened, I feel like the manager could've handled the situation much better. I will still be coming back to this place when I'm craving crepes, however, my sister made up her mind to never return before we even finished eating our food.",

Specifically, the sweet crepes we ordered, The Berry Delight and The Perfect Combination.  Both crepes left something more to be desired. The crepe batter texture was too eggy for my taste and didn't have any flavor probably so it could be used to make sweet and savory. Plus, both crepes were torn. RIP. As for the toppings, it couldn't salvage our meal either. The whipped cream was nothing notable, but the berries were sour. And since it was loaded up, it made the crepe soggy and limp. Two words you never want to describe your food with. Plus, the excessive amount of chocolate drizzle on The Perfect Combination only drowned it further.  I mean, maybe the girl working was still learning, and we were unlucky in choosing less than ideal meals, but that doesn't change that the crepe itself didn't have the right texture or flavor. For me, anyways, I'm obviously in the minority. The price is decent, the portions are good, and the food is edible but that's not enough when I've had way better for the same price elsewhere.   Overall, I left unsatisfied and disappointed, and I probably won't be coming back anytime soon. If you come to Crepe Expectations, keep your expectations low and avoid the sweets menu.",

I was amazed by not only the variety of sweet and savory crepe creations, but also the owner/chef.  He was so accommodating and inviting. He truly wants his customers to have an incredible culinary experience. My wife and i will go back here every time I travel to Vegas. Try the Mixed berry crepe and also the Monterey!",

The tables outside were all filled up as well.  The wait actually wasn't that long so we ordered at the counter and sat down. I enjoyed being able to see how the crepe was made on the t.v. We ordered the perfect combination and banana foster with white mochas.  I saw a lot of people order the mimosa sampler. I'm definitely going to try those next time. The perfect combination came with strawberries and chocolate to fill my sweet tooth. It was a thin crepe with copious amount of strawberries..delicious!  The white mocha was a bit sweet for my liking.   I think I would come back and try the carne asada crepe for brunch.",

Intimate atmosphere with lots of entertainment, everyone's friendly, smiling, and excited to be here. Perfect morning date, girls afternoon, or hangover recovery location. Outdoor seating available and they allow well behaved dogs on the patio, all sizes. I adore this place. FYI they are moving a couple of doors down soon but it's in the same shopping center so no worries. Also, extra parking is behind the building.",

    "text": "We had breakfast on a Wednesday at Crepe Expectations.  We arrived around 8:55 and waited outside for a few minutes before they opened.  The wife went with the Monterey, which has bacon, egg, peppers, tomato, cheese and onions.  I had the Sunday Morning (eggs, potatoes, cheese) and added bacon.  I'll be honest, I had no idea how big these things were, and I was worried we wouldn't have enough food.  So, we decided to get a William Tell to split.  Plus, we wanted to try one of the sweet ones.  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.  These things are HUGE, such a good value for what you get.  We brought nearly half of the wife's home, and that was with me eating some of it.  These come out very hot, which is appreciated.  No sitting around for these crepes, you get them fresh.  I loved mine with hot sauce.  Lots of cheese and crispy bacon.  I probably liked the wife's a little more, the veggies mixed with the eggs became basically like a salsa.  Again, there was a lot of cheese, which is a fantastic thing.  I think in the future I'll get the Monterey and add potatoes, that will probably be the perfect crepe.  The William Tell was fantastic, basically a nice apple pie crepe.  Again, it was enormous, so we didn't finish it.  I loved the caramel and powdered sugar on top.    After we arrived and ordered, the place got crowded.  Every seat taken and a line out the door.  But, they seemed to get through the people pretty quickly.  This is a simple menu, but it's excellent.  I can't wait to return for lunch and try a few of the savory choices.",

The line was a little long, luckily it was warm enough to sit outside so it wasn't crowded inside.  Since it was morning, I decided it was necessary to get a breakfast crepe and chose the Rosarita  The crepe: nice presentation, looked pretty full. I took my first bite and I thought I was in heaven, it was absolutely amazing. But the more I ate the crepe, I just got tired of it. The ingredients weren't distributed really well so the meat was just getting salty as the guacamole disappeared. I ended up not finishing my crepe because I just got really tired of the taste.   It came with a side of bananas though, so it helped when the crepe got to be too much. I know everyone talks about the goat cheese, but I just couldn't bring myself to get it. Maybe I'll try it next time!  The waitresses were pretty nice. The coffee is self-serve and it was out when I got it, but there was another waiting to be put out when I asked the waitress. That was a plus for me, considering no coffee would have just made me crankier.   I enjoyed my experience, but it's not a place I think \"omg I need that now\"",

There was a line when we arrived, but it moved quickly. The inside is small, dark, but quaint. I ordered the La Jolla with soup as my side while my friend ordered the Berry Delight. We took our number stand to a table outside. A waiter came out to give us our drinks and it didn't take long for our food to arrive to our table.  The food (and drinks) are a little pricey, but Crepe Expectations makes up for it by how huge the crepes are. I was pretty much full for most of the day off my La Jolla and soup. Not to mention both my La Jolla and my friend's Berry Delight were delicious. I ordered the La Jolla on a whim and it was a good, yummy choice.  Once we had finished our plates, a waiter came outside to take our empty plates which was a pleasant surprised. These people are definitely on the ball.  I'd definitely come back to Crepe Expectations to eat again. There's plenty of other choices on the menu that I want to try. Also, for those who cannot have gluten, all the crepes on the menu except the Sonara can be made with rice flour. All you have to do is ask when you order. Since I know someone who needs to eat gluten-free, that's pretty amazing.",

Went on a late Sunday morning for brunch and I was bracing myself for a very long wait to get a table.  I'd read how busy this place gets, especially on the weekends, so I was prepared.  The inside of the restaurant is tight and it was already packed when we got there, so if we wanted to eat inside we would have had to wait.  We were in luck, though, because we were able to get a high top table outside right away, and it was a PERFECT Vegas morning.    The owner took our order and was so friendly and welcoming.  I could tell he takes great pride in this restaurant and his food.  He made some great suggestions, we placed our order, and were shown to our table with a number.   While in line, I loved watching the crepes being made in the kitchen and there was also a TV you could watch the crepe-making event from LOL.    The mimosas (we tried pomegranate, raspberry, and orange) were the perfect start to our Sunday.  The Berry Delight and the Sunday Morning crepes were delicious!  The berries were fresh and ripe, and the whipped cream made the ENTIRE meal.  I loved that the Sunday Morning (scrambled eggs, jack cheese, and potatoes) came with a side of sliced bananas (you could opt for cottage cheese instead).  They had so many flavored lemonades that I want to try, and I liked the cucumber and lemon infused waters that are available if you don't want to order a drink.    What a great brunch experience - I can't wait to go back and try more crepes, lemonades and mimosas.",

The food: we got to watch it being made ( there is a camera above the crepe stations ). I opted for the savory crepe and got the little italy, which is basically a pizza crepe. It was sooo good, the cheese was melted perfectly and the sauce was really flavorful. My friend got the William Tell which was like an apple pie crepe. Very good and the apples inside were delicious :)  The drinks: i highly recommend the mimosa sampler. We both got different flavors so we could try them out, our favorites were watermelon, pineapple, and passion fruit, but they were all good.   Will definitely be back. I want to try the whole menu!",

We stood in line for 20 minutes to place our order, the line snaked around and people kept having to move for other patrons to walk by.  Maybe if we were told what the process was before sitting down it would have been a better experience. Giving it 4 stars because the food was delicious.",

    "text": "Good food, but their customer service is less than professional.  I walked in with a friend for brunch.  I stood in line to order and she went to sit at a table.  There was a guy \"policing\" the seating and told her that she couldn't sit down until we had ordered our food.  There were 3 parties in front of me, so he made her stand to the side of the counter in the hallway leading to the bathrooms.  Seriously???  So we turned around and left.  So we gave the business a second chance since, like I said, their food is good.  We arrived at the restaurant at 2:45p.  When we got to the counter, the lady/owner said they close at 3:00p, so we would have to eat outside while they close up the restaurant.  I reminded her that it was only 2:45p and she said they start closing at 2:45p so they can be out of the restaurant by 3:00p.  Again, seriously???  (Mind you, under normal circumstances, I wouldn't mind eating outside, but in Vegas in July/August, no one wants to be outside more than they have to be).  We will no longer be going back to give our business, based solely on their lack of customer service.  I can honestly say that I've never come across a small business that cares so little about  customer business/service.",

I ordered the Monterey and he ordered the Clucker.  Both were great but the Clucker was the favorite.  Everything was incredibly fresh.  The owner was really sweet and made suggestions of what we should order based on our preferences. For the price, service and quality, this will be hard to beat.  We will definitely be back.",

The  restaurant is beautifully decorated, the service was great, and the crepes were wonderful.    I started off with the mimosa trio. It is comprised of three small glasses of any kinds you choose. I had the orange, blood orange, and passion fruit. The passion fruit was definitely my favorite.  My husband had a glass of the white peach mimosa which was also very tasty.  We ordered the \"Sunday Morning\" breakfast crepe and added mushrooms to it.  It was a good size and delicious.  For our savory crepe, we had \"The Avalon,\" which was filled with pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts and honey.  It was also delicious.   Our experience at Crepe Expectations was great.  It is a great place to have a nice, relaxing breakfast, brunch or lunch.  It is also a plus that they serve wine, beer and mimosas, which makes it perfect for brunch!  The prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food is great.  The next time we go we are going to try a savory crepe and another sweet crepe. I can't wait!",

While the people working there are super friendly, and really behind two stars, and the actual restaurant is cute and clean, we found the main attraction--the crepes--uninspired and clumsy. No balsamic reduction on the caprese? Huge tomato chunks? Brown, wilted lettuce with some dressing for \"salads?\" Slightly overcooked, pancake-like crepes? This place just doesn't compare to our all-time favorite place on Oahu, No Ka Oi. Now that place knows how to do crepes. We won't be returning here.",

I was tempted to take the easy route, and go for something with bananas and nutella. I finally opted for The Grand Turk, which had turkey, cheese, guac, olives and tomatoes. I'm trying to think of a word to describe my experience with The Grand Turk, but I can't. I'll settle for incredible. The crepe was light, and almost melted in my mouth. The ingredients were fresh. It was probably one of the best crepes I have ever had, even without the nutella.  The staff is friendly, the ambiance is great, and the prices are reasonable.

Initially when comforted with so so many tasty looking choices the mind will often vapor look.  I calmed the nerves by grabbing a menu I could read in my hand. Then I went about picking something tasty to eat.  I settled on the The Rosarito which consisted of chorizo, egg, guacamole and jack cheese.  It was filling in a very light way.  Ingredients were fresh and complimented each other well.  There was also a delicious side of bite size watermelon to compliment the meal.  The GF had The Del Mar.  A crepe filled with sauteed shrimp and zucchini in a lemon butter sauce.  It was fantastic.   The libations for our meal minus the boy, unless he snuck a sip on me somewhere was the Mimosa Trio Sampler.  The three we picked were white peach (Yum), Lychee (My fave) and regular OJ which after the first two never tasted so boring,  The piece de resistance was The Sticky-Sticky. Peanut butter, chocolate and carmel..Ohhh My!  Truly a delicious way to finishing off the meal.  The staff was happy and seemed to enjoy what they were preparing and serving.  BTW..You can watch your crepe being made via CCTV that is hanging over the kitchen area.  We all look forward to making our return to continue to explore all CE has to offer.",

You could distinguish the goat cheese flavour which for me is a huge plus. The Frisco was a treat!

The Sonora was so filling and flavorful we don't think we had room for dessert but were so happy we ordered one to share. The owner took our order and chatted with us for a bit and it's nice to see such passion for a craft reflected in the product, more places need to be like this! If we lived closer we would go here a lot, but since it takes about 45 to get here this will be a special occasion place:)",

I ordered the crapese which was fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and pesto with the option to add chicken (I didn't). It was the perfect size and so fresh and delicious. The pomegranate mimosa was also perfection. I wish I had realized that they offered a trio mimosa sampler for about the same price so could of tried some of the other flavors. Overall my family and I where really blown away by how delicious everything was. We also happened to meet the owner who really seemed to love what he was doing. I expect in a couple of months they will probably have to move to a bigger location because of how busy it seemed. Cannot wait to go again!",

When you walk in you are greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere of a clean and contemporary decor. The people who work here are always incredibly friendly and willing to offer suggestions on the pinnacle items on their menu.  Everything that I have tried here was been superb! That includes:  The Berry Delight--a delicious crepe filled with fresh berries. The Monkey -- bananas, nutella, and we added strawberries...need I say more? The Monterey--a savory crepe with a bit of a zing (by far my favorite!) The Veggie Patch--veggies and hummus. Pretty standard.  And my all time favorite afternoon treat: the mimosa sampler! If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend the blood orange mimosa.  This restaurant is one of the reasons why I love company coming into town.",

    "text": "I love crepes. And surprisingly, this city is lacking in the crepe department. The only place I knew of was the little window in the Paris hotel. I am glad to see a few more crepe establishments open up, and I am even more glad to give them a try.  One of those new places is Crepe Expectations. I had great expectations for Crepe Expectations (ha-ha). And overall, I'd say they met most of them. The decor of the restaurant is nice and modern and the outdoor furniture is pretty comfy. There is even a flat screen above the counter that displays an overhead view of your crepe being made!  I hit up this place with a friend. Here's what we had:  -the Greek - a crepe filled with the typical greek items such as feta cheese and olives. The grilled chicken was a little dry and tough, but other than that, the rest of the crepe was delicious. -the Caprese - the classic salad wrapped in a crepe. The pesto sauce on top was a nice touch. -the Mimosa Trio Sampler- you get to choose from 5 flavors: classic orange, lychee, passion fruit, pomegranate and white peach. The lychee and the white peach were my favorites.  Today, the special was a chocolate covered strawberry with the mimosa trio sampler for $2 more. The one crepe and the mimosa sampler brought my total to a little over $20, which I thought was pretty pricy. I guess that's what happens when you add a little bubbly. But if you go and get just a crepe, they are reasonalbly priced anywhere from $5-$10, depending on how fancy you wanna get.  Crepe Expectations has a large variety of breakfast, savory and sweet crepes in addition to beer, wine, bubbly, coffee and tea. I can't wait to go back and try some more, especially the banana nutella crepe I was eying this morning.",

I guess all the good restaurants are actually inside the casinos, idk.  Anyway, on the last day we finally found this Gem.  Their selection was great; everything looked delicious, we couldn't decide. We decided to add strawberries to the Monkey crepe, and leave out the Chicken in a different crepe. When we asked the waitress/clerk if these alterations were possible, she laughed it off and said Of Course! She immediately offered to substitute two other ingredients into the crepe because we took out the chicken. Let me say that again; in exchange for removing an ingredient, she offered completely on her own (as if it was a no-brainer) to add TWO additional ingredients to make up for the loss. I guess with these people, take away one, add two, for free. Sweet!!!!  The crepes were fabulous. Delicioso! The cooked them from scratch, and it was quick.  We dearly wish this place was near our house!!!",

I got there early, at 11, so I could reserve a table, group meeting was at 11:15 and we knew there'd be a wait. I walked around the parking lot at the \"farmers market\" to kill some time. By 11:30, everyone was hungry and the owner said he just didn't know when he'd be able to serve us. If one table of 2 opens, they dont hold it for my waiting group, they give it away. We need all 3 tables that are next to each other to miraculously get up and leave at the exact same time. I wish he would have told me this when I called. I had reservations for Paymons but ditched them for this. Urgh!  I had the plain crepe with cinnamon sugar and whipped cream. It was OK. I wanted my crepe nicely browned on both sides but one side was more done than the other. I dont like a crepe unless it's \"well\". It was OK. For the wait and the price, it was eh, I've had better.",

No matter which category you go with you can't go wrong, as long as the fillings are what you're craving. The savory, the sweet and the breakfast items are all soooo good.  My favorite is The Rosarito. The chorizo has such a fantastic flavor. Mix that with fresh avocado and eggs, I want one right now.   The monkey and the nutty classic are also very good for you nutella fans.   I love their specialty sodas and their flavored mimosas. I strongly recommend their flight of mimosa sampler. You get a healthy serving of each flavor and their all good!  The service is excellent. The staff is very friendly even when the place is super busy.",

I was lucky and did not have to wait for a seat, but at times you may have a wait.  There is a mix of savory and sweet crepes. I ordered one of each. While I enjoyed my savory tuna crepe, the interior was a bit lukewarm and I was hoping for it to be evenly hot all the way through. My sweet crepe was just alright.  Service was okay. You order at the register, pay, and get a number, and then take a seat. Your food is then brought out to you when it is ready. There are a few seats right up against the kitchen if you want to watch crepes being made.  Prices are reasonable and the crepes a good size. Overall, a solid crepe establishment.

    "text": "Seems like a decent place if they are not busy. For a party of 3 on a Saturday they just had a very hard time keeping people happy.  Several customers interrupted people in-line giving orders to complain that they hadn't received their food or drink orders in a timely manner. The food is above average and great deal for the price.  However they only had 1 guy busing tables and also serving the drinks and didn't stop to wash his hands between those duties.  We witnessed lots of dirty dishes being picked up tossed into a large bin of trash then he made your coffee and other beverages and proceeded to deliver to your table. While they had several cooks and another guy serving the food they seemed overwhelmed when the seating area was only half full.   Prices are beyond reasonable. My suggestion would be to add more staff on weekends or busy times and even if that meant raising the price a dollar per order = totally worth it.",

Got there right at opening because I've tried to go here in past and I'm not real good at waiting and I've heard they're always busy. two savory breakfast crepes and a bananas foster. Have to say, I understand why they are really busy, really really good. The Owner's attitude is fantastic, really seems to appreciate his customers, and I would probably return every time I came to Vegas. Only downside is they don't have fountain soda. I just don't understand the canned soda at a place like this, the food was so good though and owner was really cool that I won't hold it against them, but I would suggest to call Coke and get a system",

Perhaps they could have brought us a drink refill since after 40 minutes we were dry, or some chips?  Server said 30 minutes is normal (!). This was not our first visit and we knew they were always busy and a little slow, little being the operative word. But the food was delicious.

They serve cappuccinos and champagne, and have complimentary lemon/cucumber water. Staff was extremely friendly. Bathrooms needed cleaning, and I was there right at open. Toilet paper was matted to the floor around the toilet... By the time we left, a huge line had formed and the patio was full. Probably gets pretty busy on weekends.",

Food - my sister ordered The Greek and I ordered The Marco Polo with spinach and mushrooms added. The crepes are served in large portions (I was able to eat half of my order) and I loved how crispy the edges were. The only thing I wish they'd be able to accommodate are milk alternatives for the coffee drinks. I had asked for almond or soy milk for my coffee but they only have one type available.  I highly recommend this place for any crepe cravings you may have!",

They do pay very close attention to who will be seated next so you don't have to worry, though.   I recommend: My favorite is the Grand Turk! So good. Get the soup with it, too. The mimosas are hit or miss (they all taste good, but might not taste like their flavor, ie watermelon just tastes like alcohol to me while peach tastes like peaches)- go for the \"classic\" flavors and you'll be all good.  I always imagined crepes as being sweet so I was very excited to try a savory crepe! I tried the Grand Turk the first time I visited... and that's what I get every time now :). I've sneaked a taste of The Sonora and The Monkey from friends, though, and those were also very, very good. It might not sound filling, but a crepe and a side soup (if you choose a savory one) is actually quite filling! So for around $7-$9, you can have a very happy tummy.   For busy times where there is a wait, they have a little area in the back with chairs. The host was very conscious to who is next to be seated so you don't have to worry about someone \"stealing\" your spot. Service is always very friendly and attentive. Because the restaurant is quite small, it can get super crowded during peak times. But don't let that deter you from these tasty, tasty crepes! Bon Appetit!",

I've visited a couple times now, each time being better then the last. The crepes are phenomenal and the service as well, lots of friendly faces!  I've tried both sweet and savory crepes including The Chicken Chili Verde, The Sonoran and The Berry Delight. The savory crepes are served with your choice of a side salad or Fideo soup (Mexican noodle soup) TRY THE FIDEO... it's great! I'll have to admit I favor CE Fideo to my favorite Mexican restaurants. The chicken chili verde crepe was delicious and very filling. Authentic chili verde sauce (green chili pepper/tomatillo think green salsa but cozier... if possible? Mexican Comfort food) typically served with pork I enjoyed the chicken and found it to be not as heavy. Now the Sonoran was DELICIOUS a simple blend of flavors that play so well together. Carne asada(steak), salsa, guacamole and cheese yum! I will definitely order The Sonoran again. It may be my favorite crepe yet!  Next crepe on my personal must try: The Rosario, love me some chorizo! I'll update after I am able to try.  I usually order coffee, but another popular choice is the mimosa sampler... which I have also tried. Who doesn't love mimosas?! Is that a trick question? Crepe Expectations goes above and beyond champagne and Oj. They have so many flavors! TRY THEM! My personal favorite is watermelon. But I have yet to try them all so it could change. You get 3 generous sized \"sampler\" mimosas for $10... deal of the century.  Now with all this great stuff being said, it is usually busy. I've only ever gone on the weekend. But the wait is well worth it. Also, not sure if it is every Sunday or just a particular Sunday of every month but, the plaza (in which Crepe Expectations resides) hosts a farmers market market making choices for parking slim. I was still able to find parking it just took a couple minutes longer and a few more steps to get there.  I've always enjoyed sitting out on the patio(larger seating area then inside)especially when the weather is nice.  I'm excited to go again soon and take all of my friends that visit from out of town.. particularly from LA (where the crepes are tiny and over priced) can't believe I forgot to mention the crepes are very fairly priced. And well worth every penny!  See you soon Crepe Expectations!",

Their food is amazing and their prices are well worth it. Huge portions! Mimosa sampler (3) for $10!   Can't get enough of this place.   UPDATE: Still great food. Will not be back because of whatever jerk was working the floor on 4/29/17 10am. At a seat yourself place, he rudely told us multiple times where we may and may not sit even after letting him know I had someone else coming. He then told me that I never mentioned that and was aggravated. Ended up leaving before my friend arrived because I didn't feel welcome. Called my friend and took our business next door. Horrible attitude especially for someone in customer service. Sorry to inconvenience you, won't be back again.   Everyone else (busser, cooks, & cashier were nice). Still love Jenn from last time! She's great.",

Yes you can go to the strip and get your high-priced fancy pants crepes, and they too will be good but none as delicious, as interesting, intricate & well-planned as these tasty bad boys. No I was not paid for this review, I'm just a super fan. Please come here and enjoy a wonderful brunch",

Some things you need to know:  -You pay the cashier and then sit where you want with your number. Sometimes they get so busy they will seat you based on inside/outside preference.  -Breakfast usually comes with a side of bananas or cottage cheese Lunch savory crepes come with salad or soup.  -Free cucumber or lemon water  -Fun little origami collection you can add to on register -They advertise specials on the side. Make sure you try them.   Everything that I have tried has been very good. Sometimes I don't like the guac inside so I will ask for just sliced avocados.  The staff is always very friendly. I think people just get confused with tipping cause its not a full waiter service restaurant. They should consider expanding soon and being a full on restaurant instead of ordering in the front. Decor and style is cutesy and people love their mimosas.",

We ordered the Avalon, the Nutty Classic, the Monterey, the Perfect Combination, and the William Tell.  The Avalon was so satisfying! It was probably my favorite of the bunch. The goat cheese provided a level of complex flavors that I thoroughly enjoyed. The William Tell was definitely good, but I did not enjoy the apples as much as the pears in the Avalon. The perfect combination was just that - strawberries and chocolate. The Nutty Classic was overwhelming with all of the Nutella, but it was good for the kids. The Monterey was delicious! I usually don't like savory crepes but I made an exception with this one.  The service was delightful and the atmosphere was loud, but cheerful. I will definitely be back!!",

This cute restaurant is adorned in purple, so how could I not love this place? They offer savory, sweet or breakfast crepes. I have never tried a savory crepe because my sweet tooth always wins the battle but this time, I was determined to try something different.  The cashier recommended The Sonora (Carne Asada Steak, Roasted Tomato Salsa, Guacamole and Jack Cheese) for $9. I love how they have TV screens where you can watch your crepe masterpiece come to life! My crepe was so tasty. The meat was flavorful and there was the right amount of heat. I was so full that my friend and I couldn't order a sweet crepe for dessert like we originally had planned.  They have an amazing beverage selection including champagne, wine and mimosas. I opted for water, and they offer free cucumber or lemon infused water. Perfect touch!  I got The Nutty Classic (Nutella, Fresh Chopped Hazelnuts, Fresh Whipped Cream and Powdered Sugar) to take home to my husband. He LOVED it, especially the fresh chopped hazelnuts. It is definitely a different take than other crepe places that offer the same ol' ingredients.  From reading other reviews, I'm glad I went on a Monday morning. They were still pretty busy considering it was still early and it was a weekday. I can't wait to come back!",

The space is adorable and owners Ana and Larry are amazing (Edit: found out that there are new owners)! Ana was super friendly and I knew immediately that I was coming back. I had the GRAND TURK (sauteed turkey, tomato, guacamole, black olives, and jack cheese) and it was phenomenal. Lily tried another savory crepe and we shared a dessert one (William Tell + candied walnuts). We enjoyed the mimosa trio and overall, everything was deliciously delicious. Also, servings are generous.  Because I loved it so much, I contacted Larry and asked if they would host a birthday party for 40+ people (joint for me and Ruben). They said yes and we were able to close the restaurant for our private event for the evening! And it went wonderfully. Everyone ordered whatever they pleased and I got to try crepes along the way. I also enjoyed a bottle of Cupcake Moscato purchased as a gift by one of my dear friends. Everyone loved the crepes and most importantly, the staff! It was so much fun. The best part was that only 1-2 guests had actually heard of this place and no one had tried it previously, so it created lots of new fans.",

The inside of the shop is small, and there are only a few tables outside, so I wasn't especially surprised when the host/waiter turned our party of 7 away. Luckily, the guy behind the counter (seemed like the owner) wouldn't take no for an answer. He found us a table outside with a bunch of little mini tables, pushed them all together for us, and remembered what kind of drink I casually mentioned. Great service! Plus points for being in my neighborhood and locally-owned (I'm guessing). The crepes were all good; caprese, ham & egg, pear & goat cheese were the ones I sampled. Only complaint: I wish there was more cheese in the caprese instead of so much pesto sauce. In addition, they have a wide selection of mimosas and even offer a little flight so you can try different juices. I had the blood orange and it was excellent. Prices are just ok.",

    "text": "So we drove across town to try this place out. We had 2 crepes a fresh squeezed OJ and a hot chocolate.  The decor is nice and you can even watch them create your tasty creation of batter and sugary sweets on the monitor above the crepe station!  First the hot chocolate came out. Soooo goood!!! Amazing and tasty!  Then the OJ came out. It was definitely not fresh squeezed. Maybe due to the fact they were closing they would just rush the order and give me the juice from the jug. The lady at the register mentioned that they have fresh squeezed OJ or some from the jug so this lead me to believe they gave me juggy OJ. Not cool. I wasn't in the mood to create a hassle about it though.  Then the crepes came out. The clucker was ok. It was good, but it didn't make me believe I was eating a crepe. It was bulky and the egg and meat just overpowered the actual crepe. You couldn't really enjoy it as a crepe. It was more of a a standard breakfast plate.   The Elvis though! Oh man this was excellent! I added Nutella to it which made it even more epic!! If we just had this if give the place 4 stars! The bacon and banana and peanut butter and Nutella was just great! To top it off it was smothered in caramel! Sooooo gooood!! A must try!   I'm giving this place 3 stars. The fresh squeezed orange juice wasn't great and the clucker wasn't our idea if a crepe. The hot chocolate and Elvis was great though. 2 out of 4. Not bad, not great. Everything was a bit pricey for what you got. But not gouging.",

    "text": "Thanks to Crepe Expectations, I think that I've developed an obsession over crepes. With their extensive crepe menu ranging from the savory, to the wide array of crepes to satisfy any sweet tooth, this place has you covered. They even have some breakfast crepes available all day for those breakfast lovers out there.   Walking in, I could immediately tell that there was a lavender theme going on with this place. While being surrounded by these colors was a bit threatening to my masculinity, I was happy to see that they had ESPN playing on the TVs to compensate while I devoured my crepe.  For a light dinner, I went with The Razorback: a savory crepe filled with pork tenderloin, spices, potato, tomato and red onions. It reminded me of a pork tamale, just with a very light and fluffy exterior. The side of ripe diced watermelon that came with the crepe was also a nice touch to complement the meal. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything was artfully prepared, with even a hovering camera above the crepe station so that you can see it all in action.  Their drink menu is just as extensive as their crepes; with wines, spirits and beer to fulfill the alcohol needs; to juices, coffees and teas fit enough to cater to the coffeehouse connoisseur. They also offer some complementary cucumber water, which was very refreshing. Be sure to check out their imported premium soda chalkboard to see what they have. It's bound to cycle through some changes from time to time, but their choices of soda are always delicious.  Throughout the entire visit, I was able to tell that the owners of this establishment run it with a passion. From the moment I set foot in the door, they made sure I had a good experience, from choosing the food, all the way to the end of the meal. Friendly, personable service is often hard to come by in Vegas. I'm glad to see that they offer it in leaps in bound here.",

The Rosarito (?) which was chorizo, scrambled egg, jack cheese and avocado was too heavy on the chorizo for me and it was hard to even see that there was any egg in it.   Now The Caprese which was tomato's, mozzarella, pesto, and I added grilled chicken was AMAZING. Everything tasted nice and fresh and ti was sooo damn good. nom nom.  The Berry Delight was fine. I wasn't so wow'd.   The staff was ace, Larry was so friendly and funny. I guess my experience was a bit hit or miss when it came to the crepe's but stuff is fresh and loads of choice, worth the lil drive and easy to find  :D.  And loved the decor!",

    "text": "Crepe Expectations is a stylish little corporate European style cafe serving up a wide variety of crepes.  Now I'm not the biggest crepe fan in the world (usually a little too sweet for me), but this place has plenty of tasty options, with a wide variety of coffees, beers, and wines.    It's a solid place for a coffee date with some inventive food options.  The decor is stylish stone and slightly darkened.  I was there for breakfast, but it seemed like a decent, slightly quirky choice for a first date.  The crepes themselves are light and airy pancakes made mostly from eggs.  They're a classic option in French and Swiss breakfasts, but Crepe Expectations has taken the classic crepe and fused in a colorful variety of filling options.    While I was there, I started off with the Sonora.  We're in the SW and I wanted to know what the French crepe filled with filled with flank steak, fresh avocado and cheese would taste like.  The steak was properly cooked and still tender but I'm not sure if the Sonora is a great dish overall.  The steak is heavy and I appreciate a filling meal, but the crepe made the dish feel more like a wet burrito.  I loved the contents, just wasn't won over by the combination of crepe and burrito filling.  I also had the Avalon--a crepe filled with goat cheese, honeyed pear and walnuts.  Dear god that is sweet.  A little too sweet.  I loved the consistency of the walnuts and the softened pears, but the honeyed pear completely overwhelmed the tartness in the goat cheese.  That said, I want to love this crepe.  Even sitting here, I want to reach back into the past and dial back the honey on the crepe.  When I took matters into my own hands, controlled what was on my fork, and made sure there was plenty of goat cheese, it was a really wonderful flavor combination.    The coffee was well-roasted and rich.  And they had nice little touches, like offering cucumber water and lemon water with the meal.  The beer and wine menu had some nice small brewery/small winery options and I'm a big fan of this place.  All in all, Crepe Expectations has earned a firm spot in my brunch rotation.  Based on the food, this place gets a solid 3.5 stars.  Inventive menu--that's pretty close to delicious even if the flavors were a little too sweet for me or a little off in my opinion.  The food was still prepared expertly and I do like imagination in a menu.  I threw in the extra .5 star because the staff is very welcoming and helpful.  And the people we met there on Sunday morning were very nice.  Good atmosphere and good people takes Crepe Expectations up to 4 stars.",

    "text": "I am so giddy because I luv crepes! I found out about the opening in the zip code magazine I get in the mail, and bookmarked it forthwith.  I knew that this creperie served crepes on a plate, not hand-held style, but so what?  They serve up YUM! Even though it was a late lunch for me, I opted for a sweet crepe.  I will definitely need to get back here to try savory and breakfast crepes, but The Avalon called out to me: buttered pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts.... it was amazing!  So was the service.  I was the only one inside (a few brave souls were eating outside) and I had a nice chat with the two ladies working.  I am intrigued by the flavored mimosas and will come back for those (they have a 3 mimosa sampler for $10 or one for $6) - white peach, passion fruit, lychee, traditional, pomegranate.  This would be a really fun place for me to get the yelpettes of Vegas for a crepe and mimosa brunch before my wedding (so keep your eyes open for that, belles!) Yes, I will be back...they have guacamole for savory crepes and lemon curd for sweet ones so I have to come back for those options! The interior is swanky, purple hues, fun art and mirrors on the walls, nice tables (I sat at the one by the crepe-making station), flat screen TVs, and even really nice flatware! Crepely speaking, you cannot go wrong here.",

The point is you can not go wrong with anything you order in this restaurant.   The mimosa's  are amazing especially  the white peach!  We loved the Elvis and added chocolate.   The nice thing here is you can create your own crepe or add more to the crepe your ordering and its always perfect. Their Chorizo is quality sausage with just enough spice to make it a great addition to any crepe.   If you like crepes this is the place to go!   With a flight of Mimosa's!  :)",

    "text": "Rolled in at 11am on a Wednesday morning and was HUNGRY. I had just come in from a late night flight the day before and was ready to take a bite out of my bff's arm, who joined me this morning at Crepe Expectations (shh don't tell her).   We were greeted by the NICEST smile from Ana, who turned out to be a sweetheart. She is one of the owners and puts so much care into everything she does -- as it would become evident later. My friend and I each ordered a savory crepe - I had the Marco Polo (italian sausage, egg, jack cheese) while my friend ordered the Turk (turkey, jack, guacamole). We shared the mimosa trio made from fresh fruit puree (guava, passion fruit, and white peach). I opted for a coffee (illy espressemente coffee...amazing)! The mimosas came out quick and we absolutely loved the passion fruit and white peach ones - so delicious!  When we got the plates, I was shocked. The crepes, aside from being beautifully presented, came with a side of fruit (cantaloupe), and were generously portioned. I was expecting the usual crepes-that-would-barely-qualify-as-a-snack size crepes, and had mentally prepared myself to be hungry after. NOT THE CASE. I was stuffed and the fruit was a perfect way to top things off. My friend and I were SOLD!  Then, we remembered we had ordered a dessert crepe (once again, my above frame of mind of expecting tiny portions) -- the William Tell, which has sauteed apples, caramel, whipped cream. We were craving nuts and Ana suggested throwing in some caramelized walnuts. AMAZING. TRUST THIS WOMAN WHEN SHE GIVES YOU SUGGESTIONS!!  All in all, we were gushing to Ana about how we loved everything, and she let us in on a few secrets. My friend and I dislike overly-sweet desserts, and this was perfectly done. Ana mentioned that the crepe batter doesn't have any sugar -- no wonder!   Also, we watched her make a customer the Veggie crepe. It was filled with sauteed veggies and hummus. She told us that it was 150 calories! For such a generous portion, I'd definitely come back just to try it. What a total win-win, when you can eat something hearty (and a crepe at that) and have it just be 150 calories!   Great food, great staff, well priced items for generous portions... I will definitely be back soon!",

    "text": "So, I'm biased because I already know I love crepes.  That is more than I can say for the boy who, after being served, asked why there was a pancake on his food.  I love the modernly styled atmosphere, and the novelty of the \"crepe cam\" (it is exactly as it sounds, camera feeding to a TV so you can watch your crepes being made).  And, as everyone said, the staff were incredibly friendly, that will keep me coming back.  Crepe Expectations does a great job with having a diverse menu of savory and sweet \"dishes\".  Additionally, they have fantastic prices on beer for a boutique cafe!  Most of the standard beers were only $3, and they have a pretty extensive wine and specialty drinks menu for a creperie.  They also offer the treat of all-you-can-drink serve-yourself water infused with lemon or cucumber.  Yum.  If you want \"plain water\" I think you might have to request that specially.  Bother the flavors were subtle enough I think even finicky folks can handle it.  Warning: one crepe per person is sufficient.  I expected street food style where we may want a couple each.  Bad move.   We discovered that three crepes for two people was far too much food.    I tried the Sunday Morning - which was just what I was hoping for on a Sunday morning, egg, seasoned potatoes, and cheese wrapped in a crepe.  It was a yummy savory breakfast, but honestly, with such a hearty filling, the crepe itself kind of fades into the background.  That said, I much prefer it to a standard omelet, primarily for the side bites of mostly crepe.  I do love eggy crepes...  I also tried The Avalon - pears, goat cheese, walnuts, and honey.  The flavors of pear, goat cheese, and walnut were rich and delicious.  However, the honey was a bit overwhelmingly sweet.  I guess eating three bites instead of 30 at a time is better for me anyway.  More for later!  Summary: great variety of food, friendly staff, ample creativity in dishes, good prices, I just wish the crepe to food ratio was a little higher.  That's not enough of a deterrent to keep me away, though.",

The staff is very friendly and go above and beyond to make sure your needs are met.  I love that they serve a wide variety of alcohol (beer, wine and bubbly!). It was great to have 5 different flavors of mimosas to choose from (regular orange juice, lychee, passionfruit, white peach, and pomegranate). I highly recommend ordering the sampler ($10) in which you can choose 3 different mimosas.  Now on to the crepes! There were so many varieties of savory, sweet and breakfast crepes. I opted for the Caprese which was tomato, basil, pesto, and mozzarella cheese. It was SUPER YUMMY. I am a savory crepe type of girl and am always disappointed when normal run of the mill crepe places only have 2 or 3 types to choose from. There are over 10 savory types to choose from here! Can't wait to try the Pirate! The crepes run between $5-$10.   The only downfall is it is far from my side of town. I guess my waistline will thank me for that.   Thanks Crepe Expectations for going beyond my great expectations for a yummy crepe!",

Very busy on the weekends, so it's hard to sit and enjoy with all the hustle and bustle. Very friendly staff helps their case. Lots of menu items to choose from. Portion size is decent. Somewhat pricey for brunch and no refill options for sodas (you get a can). Check it out if you're stopping by for a quick bite. Find another place if you're catching up with girlfriends on the weekend.",

Enjoyed being able to sample their top 3 (peach, blood orange, and guava - LOVED the peach one!!). Service was wonderful and they offer outdoor seating which is awesome as long as the weather is right. Will definitely be returning to Crepe Expectations!!!",

I can't remember the exact name of the dishes we got, but his was filled with mixed berries and mine was filled with apples with a bit of ice cream on top.  Oh man... Fantastic. Nothing short of fantastic either I mean it was just that damn good. I've ate the best crepes Los Angeles has to offer and let me tell ya, this is right up there on par. I don't think I could go back to Vegas and not visit this place at least once from now on. The options were just huge, and I love having extra options other then the typical strawberry, banana, and nutella or chocolate sauce.  Very friendly people here as well. Found out this place only recently opened as well, and hell all the reviews don't lie, this place is just that good. If you're in Vegas, treat yourself to the best crepes you'll have in a long time.",

I love the Rosarito, which has delicious chorizo and homemade guacamole.  I'm also a fan of the Grand Turk, which also incorporates the guac.  Most recently I tried the Bomber, and was impressed with the flavor of the meatball.  It's got some good kick!  Ana has some serious culinary talent!  I recommend going with a friend, as I can't eat a whole savory crepe and have a dessert crepe too, and it is a shame to miss out on the dessert crepes.  When I went with a friend we shared the Frisco, and it was out of this world!  The lemon curd is perfection.  I can tell the ingredients are quality, it really makes for an amazing product.   I should also mention, the staff is very friendly.  They truly appreciate your business.  The decor is beautiful (check out the bathrooms, very pretty) and I enjoy lingering after my meal with a nice cup of coffee.   There's a nice patio seating area, which is great for people watching on the weekends.  You get a very nice dining experience, and the price is not hard on your wallet either.  Enjoy!",

My friend and I made it a point to go for breakfast and was happy to see so many selections. We wanted to try a savory one but I was hesitant since I've always had sweet crepes so I picked The Frisco (blueberry & lemon curd) and my friend picked The William Tell(apples & caramel) and we both had the berry lemonade.          Mine was good they didn't cook the blueberries, which is always nice, instead they just barely warmed up in the beautifully folded crepe. They could have tossed the berries in a lil more lemon curd but the crepe itself was tender and slightly sweet cooked just perfectly and the whipped cream, which they put on the side of crepe how I like instead of on top, was fresh which in my book is always a good thing. My friend's was also very good not too much caramel and her apples cooked perfectly.          The staff  is great. The owners are very nice welcoming people with a very spunky attitude and are willing to answer any questions and make numerous suggestions. The decor is awesome I love any place that uses a lot of purple and modern touches in their decor and it's nice that they have a few tables outside so you can sit and relax in the nice weather. I would definitely keep going here even if it's so far away from my house and next time I will definitely try a savory one.",

We were staying on the strip and had to take a cab to get here (based on Yelp reviews) on our latest trip to Las Vegas. Worth every penny and will definitely be back. Great service by the owner and his wife and even gave us tips on how to improve our crepe recipes.   We had two savory crepes (the Rosarito and the Salmon special) and a sweet (the Avalon). All were fantastic. I swear by crepes with Nutella but the Avalon may have turned me - buttered pears, goat cheese and candied walnuts!  The mimosa trio sampler is great and don't leave without trying the white peach mimosa.",

Second order - Perfect Combination (chocolate and strawberry) and a Little Italy (pepperoni and mozzarella).  Little Italy came with soup, but I didn't pay it much attention.  Second set of crepes were delicious as well.    Extra points for customer service. The ladies at \"crepe bar\" noticed me commenting on how awesome the crepes looked as they cooked it and humored me.

It's nice that they have water flavored with lemon or cucumber. They also have an endless $3 cup of coffee..   I made the mistake of ordering tea, which is served in a small teapot, but at $4, its a bit pricey...  A venti tea at the corner coffee stop cost less and you get more..

The food was very good, but we waited longer for the food than we did a table.  The menu has a variety to please anyone.  The ambiance was super noisy, and I'm not a fan of tight seating.  Overall I'd return to try another flavor but during the week.",

The downside is that there is not a lot of seating and so your wait may be a little long because it's always packed but well worth it. The service is amazing and the owners are super cool. The sweet and savory crepes are fantastic!",

    "text": "Crepe Expectations. Ahhh restaurant name very similar to the 'Great Expectations' classic novel that I skimmed and did NOT read in high school. Found this on Yelp and had to try it.  We found the place pretty quickly and stepped right in. Very little and cozy restaurant and was super busy. It was so busy I was easily turned off and wanted to head to another restaurant instead but my husband convinced me to stay. We told one of the staff our names and I think they somehow jotted it down either on a piece of scrap paper in someones pocket or they have the memories of an elephant. We waited in a back hallway and tried to figure out what we would eat.  They yelled my name out and we were up and pretty much ran to the cashier to place our order. I ordered The Monkey crepe with nutella, banana, chocolate, and whipped cream and my husband ordered The Monterey with bacon, eggs, tomato, onion, peppers, and cheese. I also ordered the Passion Fruit Mimosa that I read tasted amazing. We were brought to a high table in the corner and they put a number on the table. Nice! I was served the amazing and tasty mimosa that I wanted to gulp down but it tasted so good I wanted to savor each sip (first time I drank alcohol that slowly). While we were waiting I was able to see the television that had live video of them making our crepes. You could also watch them through the glass but there is a table right there and it would seem like you were trying to eat with those people. Finally got our crepes. So nicely presented and so tasty. I love, love, loved it! We were so satisfied and so impressed that the owner/chef came by our table and actually stopped by everyone's table to make sure everything was good.   I will return to Crepe Expectations when I visit again. Such a nice and welcoming atmosphere and a restaurant that seems like they care about your food quality. Prices were good too. Place for amazing crepes and service.",

After being assigned a seating area, you immediately order your food at the cashier front. (So I suggest asking for a menu as soon as you get in)  Quality: The portion of the Sunday Morning Crepe's was the right amount for 1 serving. It is stuffed with Eggs, Cheese, Bacon and you can also add many other meats to fill up your Crepe the way you like it. The taste was great if your looking for quality.  Service: I can say service was pretty quick if your walking in for a party of 2. The front cashier was very helpful in recommending what to try. Don't be afraid to ask if your not sure what's on their menu.  Price: Per meal they ranged about $6.95-$10. Adding extras such as Bacon was .75 cents more. Comparing to IHOP or Dennys, you'll get your money's worth here with quality.   *Military Discount: Yes  Overall it was worth the drive to try something new if you don't mind driving the distance, If your looking for Crepes (Mild, Spicy or Sweet) to satisfy your hunger for breakfast/lunch. This is the place to be.",

I thought that was funny because a previous person reviewed here and said they were told about waiting in the hall. No thank you \"The Hall\" is crowded with customers at tables and right next to the bathrooms. The place is really small. Not much seating inside for how busy they were. It gets very crowded with tight tables/seating and standing in line to place your order. We ate outside, so that was a lot cooler and quieter.  Service was very good. We placed our orders and had them in a few minutes. One of us had the Rosarita, Chicken Greek, and Sonora. The crepes were very light and full of meat/veggie whatever we had ordered. We also had \"salad\" aka greens and bananas. We all liked ours, but agreed that my Sonora (Carne Asada, guacamole, and smoky salsa was the favorite. We wanted to try a dessert crepe, but were too full. I can't wait to go back with my husband and try a different one or I might just get the Sonora again! Do prepare to wait some, sit outside, and bring your appetite!",

The Avalon was my personal favorite. I felt that it was a great blend of sweet and slightly tangy with the pear, walnut, and goat cheese combo.    I expected the crepes to be small, but they were actually very filling! I think the part of the dining experience that impressed me the most was when we left the restaurant. The host actually remembered our names after only meeting us once! Made it feel like we'd been there forever even though it was only our first time.   As a slightly claustrophobic person, I'd have to say that the seating in this place was less than ideal. But don't let that deter you! The food is great, and worth the wait.",

We've been coming every Sunday for last 3 weeks and DO NOT plan on changing this anytime soon. There are a couple favorites we have separately and together of course.  Recommend: The Reuben Louis BBQ The Monterey The Sonora  Sweet Crepes: The William tell Simple Delight  All are exceptionally wonderful but so far these are our picks and we haven't been let down yet! The staff is extremely friendly and I must say this establishment is very homely. 5 star every day of the week!!!!",

    "text": "When I was at my favorite breakfast place, The Original Sunrise Cafe I was talking with the owner and he suggested that I try Crepe Expectations.  He also suggested I go early to beat the rush because the place is kind of small.   I arrived right at 8am and was greeted by the friendly owner who ushered me to a table and I stood in line to order.  The menu looked delicious and most of the crepes looked more like lunch fare than breakfast.   I ordered a basic ham and egg breakfast crepe.   I was a little disappointed that while the crepes were excellent they were not too original and they didn't offer any sauces.   I have a favorite crepe place in Saint Louis with all sorts of great sauces.   Even just a Bechamel sauce would have been a nice add-on.  As described the restaurant was kind of tiny and filled up quickly but I understand they will be moving to a larger place next door so that should no longer be an issue.  Perhaps they will open a little earlier as well.",

The interior is ridiculously dark, putting you in a quiet romantic mood, but we craved for light. Some sort of brightness. Sunlight. Anything.  We ordered two savory crepes.  My savory crepe was from the breakfast side.  I was hoping it'd taste like breakfast, but instead I felt as if I was eating a folded up pizza. I didn't get a hint of breakfast or eggs in my crepe.  The mimosa flight was awesome tho, I must say.  But for sure, next time, I'll get something from the sweet side.",

I also asked for guava juice (that's not on their menu) because I don't drink alcohol, but they had a guava mimosa.

Can't go wrong with this combination. Don't let it fool you! Definitely needs to be shared with a friend, especially if you had their savory crepes.

We arrived shortly after 9am on a Sunday so we had a brief wait to be seated and be warned it tends to get busy and on mornings like today you may wait a bit for seating indoors .  They do take names and get you set up with seats.. once our table opened up we ended up at the cash register being helped by Lou. Not only was he friendly and informative .. before us he was on a phone call with a difficult customer and handled it like a pro concerning who pours their O.J lol ..   After we   ordered and then took our seat in front of where they make the crepes .. Where I got to watch Melissa rocking it out making crepes   As far as our order we opted for the Mimosa Sampler for $10..it's a great deal below are the flavors   Watermelon, Rasberry and Blood orange were the flavors we went with .. I legit can't wait to go back and drink lots of the watermelon ones lol but they use fresh fruit ..  I've had the fresh squeezed lemonades as well and they rock !!  As far as crepes we got one savory and one sweet   Marco Polo with added cooked onions was one savory and the sausage is so freaking good and the balance was perfect ...  We opted for the seasonal pumpkin spice cheesecake one which is good if that's your thing but it was almost too much cheesecake not enough spice which i can't believe I'm saying cause I don't like pumpkin spice stuff typically but it's tasty however my favorite sweet one is the Elvis but if you check out the menu or specials at the register ..  Better yet feel free to ask Lou he will hook ya up with good ideas . Plus I guess this is a DDD location cause I just saw a preview for next weeks guys next big project and one of the contestants is at this location ..  As long as you are open to waiting for a seat this is a super affordable place to enjoy a delicious breakfast or brunch .. check it out !!! Come hungry and I'm pretty sure you will leave Happy!!!",

I visited around 11:30 and there was only space to be seated outside (the space inside is quite small). I did not mind this at all since the weather was really nice.   I ordered \"The Pirate\" which has a tasty tuna salad inside the crepe with swiss cheese. I thought the bite was very tasty and the portion perfect. I was looking to eat something that would not make me super full because I had a holiday even to go to later in the day. Each crepe comes with a side of soup or salad. I chose the second option which was a Mexican noodle soup. I thought this was tasty, but not amazing.   Overall, I would def be back to this place! I saw on the menu a sweet crepe \"The Avalon\" which was buttered pears, goat cheese, walnuts and honey that I have a feeling I am really going to like.",

    "text": "I really wanted to enjoy this restaurant because there are so many great reviews!  We got to Crepe Expectations on Saturday morning, so of course we were expecting it to be busy! There was a line out of the door. The restaurant is set up where you order your food, then (if available) find a seat. There were no open seats, however we didn't want to place an order to go. There was a waiter going through the line asking who was placing to go orders and who was wanting to eat there. I informed him we wanted to eat there, so he told us to get out of the line and wait. We waited for around ten minutes, then he came back and told us to get back in line? It was very confusing. I noticed he had done this with a couple other people as well. After we ordered we were told to wait again for an open table. Unfortunately it was cold outside so we didn't want to take an open table outside. After fifteen minutes we got seated, and we were seated right by the kitchen. Right next to our table was a drip coffee section, people who ordered drip were advised to come ask for a cup and get their own coffee. I noticed everyone who was trying to get their coffee were very confused as to what they need to be doing. They would try to get someone from the kitchen's attention, but everyone in the kitchen were so busy that no one was available to get the customer's cups.   We got our food, and it was great! I do understand why everyone raves about the food. We got a couple crepes that looked great and were enjoyable to eat. It was also neat to see the chefs making your crepes! However, it was not worth the unorganized trouble that we went through.   This restaurant would benefit from changes that need to be made! It looks like they recently changed locations, so maybe what they were doing worked for them at their previous location, but with the current location and set up of the building what they are doing definitely doesn't work. The main suggestion I have is setting the drip coffee station at the front and the person taking their order gives them a mug and directs them to the drip station right next to them. Another suggestion I have is to possibly allow people to sit down before taking orders, if they are staying and not placing an order to go. The order process was very confusing and even the waiter trying to keep it organized was all over the place! With a few adjustments, I could definitely see myself enjoying my experience here more.",

Everything is brought to the table. Staff is quick and friendly. Small staff doing a lot of different things. If you get regular coffee, they will hand you a cup and you can serve yourself. All over drinks are brought to the table.  Hubby was happy to see fresh watermelon juice, it is his favorite.  Lots of fun and great food.",

I got a crepe with bananas, nutella, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and added strawberries.  It was good other then the chocolate really over powering the flavors.  I would get the chocolate sauce on the side.  The boyfriend got the crepe with apples and a caramel sauce and it was good.  My friend got the one with carne asada, it was good.  I work in restaurants, and its nice to see when places get busy.  One of the girls was walking around asking all the tables how everything was, cleaning tables, and it seemed like she paid attention to her guest.  I over heard her talking to the table infront of us and remember they came in for the last few days, wished them safe travels and said hope to see you guys when you come back.    What was cool was there was cameras right above the crepe stations so you can see the whole process.    Coffee wasnt great, strawberry lemonade was super sweet, and it was a bit warm inside.    Seemed like there was a lot of locals that dine in.   I will come back if im back in Nevada.",

This place, however, does not have a specific fruit sauce except for the banana creme de something. It's a light thin creme sauce that comes on their Ana Banana Crepe BUT you can add that creme sauce on any of the crepes which is nice. They have a variety of crepes here, fruit stuffed crepes to protein stuffed crepes. I like their batter they use for the crepes, it's the right amount of rubbery texture where it doesnt just taste like a thin pancake. Now, do I think that the crepes are worth the almost hour wait? Not really....but their crepes are better than most places I have tried here in Vegas / Henderson.",

    "text": "Lazy Sunday morning and my refrigerator had nothing I could or would eat... so I called Mom and asked her if she'd like to join me for lunch. I said I wanted to check this place out after my friends raved about it. We made a date and, voila, dejeuner!  Straight to the good stuff: Crepes!  As it says on my profile... I don't eat much, but I eat well. That's also the best excuse *ever* to order too much and, if needed, send it home with Mom. ;)  Savory: The Caprese (extra pesto, please!). The mozzarella was fresh and creamy, the tomatoes firm and bright and sweetly tangy, the basil was sweet and fragrant, and the pesto was...   . . .  ... oh, uh, my apologies... I was daydreaming about the pesto. Thicker than some pestos, the flavors were deep - nutty, cheesy, garlicky, basily (are these words?!) - *without* being heavy or oily. Absolutely on my faves list now.  Savory: The Grand Turk. Tender, tender turkey makes this crepe fantastic. The other ingredients: guacamole, olives, cheese, are great accompaniments, yes, but the Grand Turk is not just named for it's protein base, but truly because the turkey shines. Sauteed, it has a smokey roasted/grilled taste that really makes it stand out.  Sweet: The Avalon. Sauteed, buttered pears, walnuts, honey, and goat cheese. An amazing combination that ends up just sweet enough. The nuts and cheese keep the honey and pears perfectly balanced. I had only one wish, and I expressed this to Ana when she stopped over to chat, was that it had more of the goat cheese and the creamy tang that it imparts into the dish.  Sweet: The Frisco. Blueberries and lemon curd. One bite and Mom just smiled with that \"oh, yes, my mouth is happy\" look that she gets over good food. I loved the freshness of the berries, that ripeness that brings a perfectly sweet/tart juicy bite. Add the zest of an amazing lemon curd? Fab, fab dish! Ana even took the time to talk to us about how she worked through the dish to perfect it, and shared some ideas on lemon curd outside of the crepes!   I mention a lot that I don't eat bread, rice, potatoes or pastas but for a small bite here and there. So, I can admit to leaving way more crepe behind on the plate than should be legal. That said, I *do* taste things, and I had quite a few tastes of the crepes themselves, not just the amazing filling. Light batter that packs a great flavor, perfectly griddled, and even consistency are important in a crepe. Crepe Expectations has got this hands down and, dare I say it, easily rivaling my favorite little spot in Seattle's Pike Market.  Add to all of this the lemon and cucumber waters (cool, tasty without being overpowering, and oh-so-refreshing!), the large menu of libations (coffees, teas, juices, wines... so many options!), there is something for every person (and to complement every crepe!).  The service is phenomenal. Larry and Ana know what customer service means. They will chat you up if you want to chat, share their experiences, and truly try to get to know you. Much like I try to never meet a stranger, they easily make friends of their customers. The rest of the staff is friendly, fast-moving but laid back, and the whole of the experience is inviting.  Something else I noticed: From posted signs (no smoking! wash your hands!) to the artwork, to the light switches to the bathroom lighting: everything is coordinated, put together with purpose, and cohesive.   With that kind of attention to detail, plus the amazing food and the stellar service, this is easily on my Must Go Often And Bring Everyone Here list.",

They are warm, attentive, the food is amazing, they play the food network on tv's, or you can watch them make the crepes a screen they have set up. The place is beautifully decorated and the coffee is awesome. I can't say enough good things.   There is normally a line unless you get there early. It is a wonderful place and it's so nice to see such a fantastic family/ group of people being awesome and successful. A must visit.",

My brother normally calls every morning and orders himself a breakfast crepe And then he'll go his way to pick it up... I see him eating them all the time and never thought anything of it. But then a client said to me that we should go to lunch one day at crepe expectations. Okay, so we went! I had to Sonora crepe which was absolutely amazing. And a seasonal pumpkin cream cheese crepe with candied walnuts!!!!! Holy cow! This is my new favorite place!  The flavor combinations are amazing the crepes are made absolutely perfectly the staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean. On top of that they have a dog friendly patio. I'm in heaven!  I gave this restaurant a four out of five strictly because of flavor consistency. I ordered a cream cheese pumpkin crap that had candied walnuts which was amazing. The next day I ordered the same thing from my mother and there was no candied walnuts. I had a Sonora crepe which was amazing and then wanted one to go which was four times as spicy.  Other than that absolute perfection. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends family coworkers and clients! It's got a small cozy atmosphere. Definitely try this place!",

Visited this place on a whim since I was staying close by in Henderson at the Green Valley Ranch.    Ordered a lunch crepe with turkey and avocado and a dessert crepe with lots of berries and an extra side of bananas.    Everything was delicious and I will definitely come here again! I'm giving them five stars because BOTH of the crepes were outstanding and that usually doesn't happen.  Usually one crepe is better than the other but both of these crepes were delicious and fulfilling!  They had some outdoor seating and I heard good things about the mimosas but didn't try one, sadly.",

    "text": "Started our experience of visiting DDD locations here in Vegas. We visited for lunch and were very surprised at the small size of the place. Size doesn't matter in this case! We tried the Sonora (carne asada) and the Marco Polo (Italian sausage & egg). Started all with a Habanero laced Michilada.  The carne asada in the Sonora wasn't your usual burrito stand asada.  It was very tender,  nicely marinated and finished perfectly with guacamole. The side salad was just a tiny treat in itself. A small portion of spinach laced with a sneaky taco flavored dressing. Quite a treat in itself. The Marco Polo is a breakfast dish.  Sausage,  egg & light cheese. I added mushrooms.  This was good with a dash of tapatio but I think I'm a Sonora fan.  You shouldn't be disappointed here.  The folks from the show are the folks making your food,  taking your order and visiting you at your table. Great, real people and a fun visit.  My only regrets.... Not trying something from the Mimosa selection and leaving room for a dessert! We'll be back for the William Tell dessert.  Beware!  They close at 3pm. So plan accordingly to not be disappointed.  Thanks Guy for another nugget in Vegas!",

    "text": "What a delightful little cafe!  My sweet husband knows that I really enjoy good crepes and in his search for a place to go while in Vegas, he found Crepe Expectations.  It's located in an unassuming, newer shopping center with an eclectic mix of restaurants, offices and stores. There are some tables out front of what looks like a small cafe, but once inside, the space seems quite large. The decor is tasteful and cohesive. The staff we encountered all provided prompt an friendly service.   Now for the crepes...  In theory I like savory crepes, but I never seem to be able to pass up the sweet ones, so I ordered The Frisco with flavorful blueberries, lemon curd, fresh whipped cream (NOT from a can) and powdered sugar. The crepe itself was light, thin & perfectly cooked. The lemon curd & plump blueberries were divine!   My 'savory' husband ordered The Little Italy with pepperoni, mozzarella & a tomato-basil sauce. It also came with choice of soup or mixed greens salad. He went with the soup and it was all very tasty. For drinks we just opted for the complimentary cucumber and lemon waters which were very refreshing , especially when mixed together. However they do have an extensive beverage menu including fresh juices, coffee, tea, premium sodas (Bundaberg Ginger Beer!!),  wine and  beer.  Overall, we had an excellent experience and have added Crepe Expectations to our list of favorite must-eats while in Vegas!",

When it was our time to order the awesome cashier offered his suggestions along the way. I went with the Sonora and added mushrooms, while my sister went with the Greek. We shared both and decided the Sonora was better simply because the feta cheese in the Greek wasn't the best. The crepe itself though was phenomenal!! For Desert we had the Nutty Classic with Strawberries added. It was perfect and you should really try it! We also had the mimosa flights. My favorite flavor was the blood orange.

The waitstaff was awesome and gave great recommendations on food and mimosa.  The food came out quick, the mimosas fresh, and the the portions more than expected.  The prices are also very reasonable ($8/meal, $10/3 mimosa sampler), especially given the same type of cuisine and quality on the strip would be 2.5x the price.  The restaurant is located inside a shopping center in Henderson but has a  nice outdoor patio for sitting that is very cozy.  You order at the counter and the food is prepared right in front of you.

Their traditional mimosas are good, but I tried their sampler with strawberry, mango, and one other flavour which I cannot remember.

The cook (he mentioned it was his first day on the job) brought us the dish he made- it didn't look like it was made correctly. In fact, kind of sloppy. Then when I tasted it, I could taste the mushy uncooked batter. It sucks because I heard so many good things about the Veggie Patch.   I will definitely come back. Hopefully the cook will improve!",

Second time we visit here I also brought my older son.  We sat inside because it was too windy out the patio.  I have noticed the kitchen is very small, quiet dirty looking yet we finished n enjoyed their foods.  Third time we came here was yesterday because it was my sons birthday so I brought all my 4 kids.  I ordered Monterey, after serving this to me I cut one slice and I saw a strand of hair, I lost my appetite n I felt that my this place is really dirty.  While reading some reviews here, I read the same issue about hair strands on their foods.  How come this management is not paying attention with the correct handling n cleanliness of foods and place.  I will not come back here anymore.  Disgusting place to eat.",

Just crepes of all kinds for all people with all sorts of tastes and flavors from savory to sweet to spicy to light to hardy! I first started going here at their first location and it was crowded and there was a wait but no one cared and no one left because everyone knew it was worth the wait but, I was pleased to see that they moved and upgraded! Staying close to home (about two doors down from their original place) they remodeled and now have a huge gorgeous outside dining eating area. There is ALWAYS COMPLIMENTARY cucumber and lemon water set up and readily available for whenever you need a refill. You can watch the cook making the delicate crepe through the glass or on screen from the camera pointed directly on to the special round griddle. It's so interesting and pretty entertaining and such a relief to see that your food is handled properly and made with fresh food and produce. My husband is a picky eater and he said he'd DEFINITELY be back and my 12 year old wants to go there for every birthday breakfast! We love it!",

Came here one morning and was quite surprised at how cute and quaint this place was.   Kind of dark inside with frames and curtains on the wall. Decorated like you were in a country home versus a strip mall in Las Vegas.  The man who took my order was very friendly and recommended various items as it was all our 1st times there.  Funny thing is the 1st thing we ordered were the mimosa samplers. 3 samplers for each of us: guava, blood orange, watermelon, strawberry, grapefruit, coconut, pineapple, and 2 other flavors I can't recall.  Each flavor was pretty good and infused well with the champagne. Problem was it was giving me the burps before I even got my meal.   I'm more of into savory crepes kinda gal and the guy recommended the Sonora (asada steak) or the Pirate (albacore tuna) but, I was intrigued by their special of the day, Reuben crepe with the roast beef, sauerkraut, etc... UGH, it was like a sandwich...so. good!!!!! My sandwich, also, came with a chicken tortilla soup. LOVEd it. I'm pretty sure I could have just ordered that and be a happy camper.  My friends ordered the Marco Polo breakfast crepe (sausage) and another special of the day that had chicken in it. I wish I knew the name as it was quite tasty. So, was the Marco Polo.  This place is so great that I wish I could eat here everyday so I could try a new savory crepe. Exciting flavors! Can't wait to come back!",

The location has a small dining area with tables outside. If it gets busy, put in your name and they call you when a table is ready, order at the counter and wait to enjoy a tasty meal.   I started off with a savory crepe, The Sonoma... carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole and jack cheese with a side of soup. Enjoyed every sip and bite of this meal. I had a few bites of my friend's banana foster crepe. Yum! can't go wrong with a classic.  They also offer, bubbly/mimosas and wine by the glass or bottles and a variety of beers. Cheers!  Other notes: Upon arrival my friend tells me that this location has been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives aka Triple D. I may have caught the episode. Will have to find and watch it again. Service was attentive and friendly as well. I'll be back!",

This place is usually packed and it takes a bit to get your food, but it's worth the wait, and the price is right.  There is a good mix between sweet and savory.  Most all of the sweet dishes are a bit too sweet for me, but I have sweet tooth friend's that love them.  The Veggie Patch and La Jolla are my favorites, but to each their own.  The also have nice flavored water that you can use yourself, but bring your own drinking cup if you're a bit of a environmental nerd like me because although they use plates and silverware, they use plastic for those cups.  Family run place, and you get that feeling that they take pride in making this a nice establishment.  Enjoy.",

We both went with sweet crepes - Avalon for me, Ana bananas Foster for my friend. The Avalon is actually what brought me in the door - can't go wrong with pears (canned, but cooked to order on the stove with butter), goat cheese, candied walnuts and honey. It was delish.... crepe was light and not too sweet, and you could taste each individual ingredient.  I tried the Ana bananas Foster too - it was good but a little too banana for me. My friend loved it.  We also shared the mimosa tasting with lychee, white peach and pom. The white peach was our least fav, we just weren't feelin it. Lychee was great and went perfectly with our sweet fruity crepes. We also liked the pom, but not necessarily paired with the crepes. It was a good deal for $10 but note that they're cute little tasting glasses, not 3 full sized wine glasses as it kind of looks in the pic someone posted.  It was a great first time visit and I look forward to trying savory crepes like the rosarito and that cupcake moscato d'asti. Never thought of getting drunk at a crepe shop before, but with such reasonably priced wines, why not.",

    "text": "There are not a lot of creperies around and not very many places for breakfast either.  While looking on Yelp for breakfast eateries today my wife found Crepe Expectations.  Wow! What a great little place this is!  The owners did a terrific job with decor.  This is a very intimate spot with half booths on one side and high top tables on the other.  Coffee and water are self serve from the small beverage bar, I didn't mind as it is a very short walk to refill.  There was no self serve soda fountain, I assume that was behind the counter someplace, didn't bother me in the least.  There are also a few tables and umbrellas for outdoor dining as well.  Back to the interior, there was a large TV in the dining area showing the Food Channel.  I don't know if that is standard or just for today.  By far the more interesting TV was the smaller one over the register displaying an overhead shot of the chef making your crepe!  Very novel idea!  Now, down to what you all want to know....the food.  Full of flavor, it had a very fresh taste as though it was all organic food, no preservatives.  I don't know if this was the case but it sure tasted that way.  The portion looked small but the crepe was packed, I was pleasantly filled with my breakfast crepe.  On the side we had a choice of cottage cheese or sliced bananas.  While not a fan of cottage cheese, I took the banana....again, I enjoyed this part of the meal even though I didn't think much of it at the time.  Overall, Crepe Expectations exceeded all of my expectations.  We are going back later this afternoon for a dessert crepe...maybe I will do an update.  One last thing, the hours are very limited...they close at 3 pm so  don't plan on coming in for a late dessert.  A great place to eat and I am looking forward to my next visit.  I'll be back in the city in June and I am sure we'll eat here again.",

When we first walked up, we were greeted by a man, he took our name and suggested that we sit inside in a \"waiting area\" while a table opened up. So at this place, you order your food at the counter, take a seat and they bring out your food. Since they were so busy and had no available seating, the man suggested that we wait to order our food until we had a table, which makes sense. We were offered two spots at their largest table where we would share the table with other customers, but we passed up on that. We waited about 10 minutes until we had our table and ordered. Our food took about 10-15 minutes to come out. I had the The Sunday morning which had scrambled eggs, potatoes and cheese which was delicious and super filling. My husband had The Berry Delight which had strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, powdered sugar on top and whipped cream on the side. It was good, not as filling since it was just really fruit, but still really good. I would give this restaurant 5 stars, but when you're inside, it's small, you feel super cramped up and it's pretty crowded. It was a busy Sunday tho, so that's understandable. Other than that, it's a great place for breakfast/brunch!",

I went with a group of wonderful people so I was able to try a little of everything. I ordered the Avalon which had buttered pears, goat cheese, walnuts, and honey. It was absolutely delicious. It was sweet but not too sweet if you are in the mood for dessert. I had the flight of mimosas which was also delicious. My favorite mimosa is the one with passionfruit even though it is a little sweet. The cashier we spoke with was very friendly, happy, and I really enjoyed our experience at this place.",

    "text": "\"It's legal to take a crepe in public\"   This little hole in the wall was everything I hoped it would be. They got me excited before I even walked in the door with their bowl of doggy treats and water on the patio. Their menu is full of so many options that I'm sure everyone will find something they like. The place is designed beautifully from the purple walls to the TV screen hanging up so you can watch your crepe being made. Specialty sodas beers and mimosas are on the menu as well as sweet and savory crepes. The food was absolutely amazing, melt in your mouth. I had the Monterrey which was just the right amount of bacon and spicy goodness all mixed in. 2nd best part of my visit here was the customer service. Polite, friendly and everything you would expect at any establishment. Our crepe cooker even came to the table to ask how it was. Of course my mouth was stuffed so all she got was a big head shake of approval but I really wish I could have hugged the woman. Definitely give this place a shot if you are looking for a light meal that will most definitely fill you up.",

    "text": "The crepes are amazing.  There is no doubt that this place has fantastic food.  Crepes are thin, crispy and perfectly cooked, and filling choices are varied with something for every palate.  Fresh ingredients, great flavor combinations.  All that being said, I gave this place only 3 stars for the way they treat customers.  Their posted closing time is at 3 pm, but be prepared to be given the boot a few min after 3 pm.  What restaurant does that?!  I've never been directly asked to leave at 5 min after \"closing\".  They started breaking down at 2:30, carried away the self-serve drinks, swept, closed out the till and set chairs on tables well in advance of 3 pm.  Then at 3:08 pm asked us to leave.  So basically, this place should state their hours are until 2 or 2:30, but not 3 pm. We arrived before 2 pm, expecting to have a little over an hour for our meal - we did not expect to be promptly asked to leave at 3 pm.  Both good food and good service are necessary for a thriving restaurant business.  If you don't love it, don't do it.  And if you want to close up early and ask customers to leave,  perhaps you should build ejection seats into the chairs so you can get rid of those pesky customers finishing up their meal as soon as possible.",

However, it seems as if those who know the owner personally get special treatment here. We were told that there was no seating inside for 6 people and would have to sit outside. Since it was early morning and roughly 54 degrees it seemed a little much. While waiting in line the owner allowed a group of 4 who just arrived to go before us because I assume from the way they spoke they knew each other. Extremely rude, and unprofessional.  To get coffee you have to walk up yourself to a little dirty table in the back, where cooks also leave food for the waiters to deliver. Coffee was out and when I tried to ask the guy behind the counter to refill it he completely ignored me.  Only 2 stars because the food was okay. If you're a larger group looking for breakfast, or don't know the owner, this place is not for you!!",

I chose The Greek ($8.50) with a side of fideo soup, The Avalon ($7.75) with a side of cottage cheese, and an order of Guava juice ($2.50). The Greek is a savory crepe which has grilled chicken, spinach, feta cheese, tzatziki yogurt, kalamata olives, red onion, and tomato. The Avalon is a sweet crepe which has buttered pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts, and honey. For The Avalon I did ask for peanut butter filling and was charge an extra 50 cents, but when I receive the crepe there isn't any peanut butter. I had to reach out for caramel sauce just to sweeten it and add more flavor. Both crepes are good but it's not something I would enjoy as a daily meal. I'm more of a soft and fluffy pancake type. The fideo soup and guava juice are probably the only two items I like the best. Overall the service is friendly, I like that the server is attentive. I just wish they had paid more attention-to-detail making the correct order.",

We shared a strawberry and blueberries crepe that came with light whipped cream.  It was all light in flavor, no excess anything, which was great. We left feeling nice and full. Nothing was excessively oily, salty or sweet...Perfect for the palate.  You get the r/o water yourself from a table with plastic cups (cucumber infused).

He had never had one, and was doubtful he would like it.  While we were discussing possibly leaving for somewhere else, the gentleman behind the counter started walking us through the ordering process by asking us things like \"sweet or savory? Spicy or mild? breakfast or lunch?\" until he had the perfect, individualized combo of ingredients to go into the crepe. No backing out now!  We swung by the condiment station to grab some of the lemon and cucumber infused water, and then went outside to sit down.  Food arrived, and was absolutely wonderful. Hot, flavorful, large servings. Crepes come with either banana or cottage cheese, which were both also delicious. I had a spicy chorizo crepe, and it was cheesy and meaty , with just the right amount of spice. Prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food. I will absolutely visit again.",

But think of these like thin tortillas, a burrito, able to fill in with whatever your heart desires.

If you go on the weekend when it would busy, you have to go to the counter and let them know how many people you have, and they won't take your order until you're seated, which has its pros and cons.   The owner is usually working the register and he's awesome - he'll make great recommendations based on what you like or are in the mood for and he's really personable.  Only four stars because when it's busy, it's a bit of a long wait. That being said, DEFINITELY worth it!",

Let's start with the service - Lou (at the register, and the owner) and Mike (greeting and serving) are both so kind and friendly and instantly make you welcome. They make it feel like a family place, which is so nice. Often we have to wait to order and be seated, but it's well worth it and a small space so not surprising in the least for how delicious everything is.  I've tried every breakfast crepe on the menu and my fave is by far the Rosarito - eggs, guac, jack cheese and chorizo folded into a delicious crepe. First, I generally can't stand chorizo, but this is additively delicious and not greasy in the least. Second, I prefer egg whites and that's never an issue to customize as desired. Hubs always gets the vegetarian breakfast one that has potatoes and adds guac. Then, we order some salsa on the side. Never before had I thought of eating savory crepes before here, but they are oh so delicious!  So, the salsa...Mike by now knows hubs well and that he loves spicy so if their not too busy and have hot peppers in back, he has some super spicy salsa whipped up for him. It makes them both happy which is fantastic, and just a nod to the wonderful experience they provide there. I can't recommend Crepe Expectations enough - the crepes are all beyond delicious and the quality and caring service provided by Lou, Mike and the rest of the folks there is wonderful.",

My husband and I were both in the mood for some fresh delicious crepes and had zero desire to walk to the Paris hotel and casino. I looked up crepes on Yelp and was really impressed with the 4.5 star rating.   This is an adorable little place nestled in a strip center with a ton of other restaurants. They have a nice little seating area outside, the interior isn't too big. We ordered the Monterrey breakfast crepe with bacon, eggs, peppers, cheese and chilies, the Crepelete with Swiss, eggs and thick smoked ham and the Monkey with Nutella, sliced bananas, whip cream and chocolate drizzle. Each crepe was totally different and delicious. They were generous with the fillings and  given a healthy dose of cheese. The Monkey was super good and went perfectly with the other crepes and my coffee. They have a camera over the crepe griddles so you can see them make each order. The eggs are even made to order, no scoop out of a warmer here.   They offer fresh cucumber and lemon water to drink along with a variety of mimosas, beers, soft drinks and coffee. There is even a mimosa flight!   I highly recommend this place! Even more so because you are getting quality food without the Strip price tag. Totally worth the drive and you get to see another side of Vegas while you are at it.",

We have been sitting for 15 minutes just to receive apple juice for my daughter and sister.   Definitely love the food but for the amount of time you spend waiting is just not worth it in my book.   Especially with an antsy 3 year old it's almost not worth the money. I could have had a nice crepe whipped up over at IHOP for half the price and half the wait time. Put my order in at 11:22 and it is now 11:45. This is just one wait that is a bit too far stretched for me  I will only come back if this place gets more staff on hand to deal with crowds big and small.   Actually   Upon waiting 30 minutes(luckily my mom called so I have the call log to prove my wait time) the owner and server show nothing but disrespect. My daughter finished her apple juice in the waiting period. I noticed other patrons that arrived after me already finished and walking out. If you make a mistake and forget a customer, do your best to make it right. Not argue. If you don't have customers, you don't have a job to go to. Thanks for refilling my daughters juice, it's not like I asked you to comp my meal. Especially for a fresh cooked meal, a smile or some respect to your patrons would be nice.   One thing I did not like at all was them arguing with me over the damn juice. He had the nerve to shout in front of everyone \"There's always that one person that wants everything for free\" When did the words free or give me anything come out of my mouth. Never.   So you just lost a patron. Hopefully more people will see True colors of this place and realize there's much better breakfast/brunch spots in town.   Disrespecting a woman is one thing, but to do it in front of a room full of people is another.   I wish him a better day. Maybe a career choice as well.",

The first two ingredients listed for the entree were red peppers and portobello mushrooms.  The red peppers did not look fresh, thank goodness there was not a whole lot of them.  There were no portobello mushrooms at all!  Only 2-3 tiny ones but not portobellos.  A lot of hummus, for sure, and zucchinis.  This crepe should be renamed Hummus Mud Patch, there was so much hummus it was oozing out of the crepe!  Or the ingredients listed should be re-arranged wth portobellos taken out altogether.  Sadly, my expectations were not met, definitely disappointed, will not be back.",

There is a fair amount of tables inside the place, and additional outside, but the day we came it was cold and windy, so inside was our only option. We needed a table for four, so I had to be one of those annoying people who hang around until a party leaves so I could pounce on a table that became available. The gentleman running the place was very nice and tried to be as accomodating as he could be, I knew he was super busy and trying to take orders and run food at the same time and also clean tables.   While I waited for the rest of my party to arrive, I passed time with the mimosa trio, mango, tangerine and watermelon. Mango had to be my favorite. They have a really good selection of savory and sweet crepes, so depending on your mood, many options. I couldn't decide, so my friend and I decided to split two, The Monterey (which is on the breakfast yumm menu available anytime) it had bacon, scrambled egg, tomato, red onion, serrano peppers and jack cheese. Jackpot!  This was scrumptious! Then we split the Elvis (or was it called Fat Elvis)? Bacon, peanut butter, bananas and caramel. Really? Need I say more?   Props for having a great beer selection (Chimay anyone)? and they have ginger beer! I LOVE ginger anything. I'm definitely coming back, a long wait won't keep me from this place, just can't come starving like I did previous two times.",

    "text": "Absolutely phenomenal. It has been a bit since I have been willing to give an establishment 5 stars after only one experience, but my initial visit to Crepe Expectations was simply all around perfection.   I met a friend for brunch on a Sunday at 11 am. The place was packed, with a line of people waiting to order and be seated. For a minute I contemplated leaving and finding a less busy place to eat, but we had been talking about trying the crepes (and mimosas!!) here for too long to do that... Besides, that may people willing to wait was almost sure to be a indicator that good things were to come to us if we exercised a little patience.   The line moved surprisingly quick, we were seated at the 'bar' in front of the crepe making stations about 20 minutes after arrival. The bar is a prime spot to sit.. You get to watch every crepe get made. Based on what we saw, I already know what I will be ordering the next 2-3 times I go in.   We started out our meal with some of the self-serve cucumber water (love that there is an option other then lemon!) and a mimosa trio. We tried the raspberry (ok), the blood orange (delicious) and my favorite, the nectar of the gods, aka the white peach. I have no idea what kind of bubbly is used at Crepe Expectations, and I do not claim to be an expert on champagne either...  but these mimosas were some of the tastiest I have ever had.   On to the grub!! I had the Sunday Morning with bacon added. This crepe slaughters every breakfast burrito I have ever had with regard to taste. It was amazing, the only thing it was lacking was a little salsa, but it was still excellent without it. Since we were debating between sweet and not sweet crepes, my friend and I also split the Berry Delight. Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries, all super juicy and fresh... with just the right amount of whipped cream.   Honestly the ONLY thing I can say about Crepe Expectations that isn't positive is that it's on the small side. With food and service this good, I think they could easily fill an area double, maybe even triple the current size. Regardless, even knowing there may be a wait, I'll be back. And for the days I can't wait, there is always the option of takeout! I look forward to warmer weather, as the outdoor seating looks right up my alley (and they are dog friendly at Crepe Expectations!!) 5 star, all around amazing place.",

The only problem was that there is apparently a method to being served and the waitress didn't care to tell me when we were seated. You order at the register and then sit down. So we sat for about 15 minutes before I asked the waitress about ordering. She was short and directed me to the register. I was peeved. It's small place. We must have been visible.   But our order was taken we returned to the table. A Greek inspired crepe and one with bananas. They were huge so she split each down the middle and shared. Very good. Definitely worth the wait.",

    "text": "There are very few places to get Crepes.  Thank goodness for this one.  Very small restaurant, but the the ambiance, decor, and furniture is calming.  The dim lights.  I think the word is intimate?  Not that intimate because alot of people go there and it can get a little loud (but not to the point where you're yelling at your friend).  Patio seating is available too.  The weather was cloudy (with some rain) the last time I came, but they had a tent if you still wanted to sit outside.  I did.  This is the perfect place to hang with your girlfriends for mimosas, champagne, and brunch.  It just has that ambiance to it.  Water options include cucumber water or regular water.  Cute.  Cucumber water tastes so much better than regular water.  Sweet and Savory menus.  All crepes are good for two people (unless you're really really hungry, or you just eat more than the average person).  I've tried the Little Italy, The Sonora, and the Ana Bananas Foster.    The Little Italy is (what I think) like a light calzone or a homemade hotpocket.  You can't go wrong with that if you like Italian food or pizza.    If you like mexican, The Sonora is a great choice.  The Ana Bananas Foster has a sweet and semi-bitter taste to it (due to the brandy).  It comes with a side of whipped cream.  Fantastic, but I think they put a little bit too much bananas in the crepe.    Clean bathrooms.  They have a sugar scrub you can try in the bathroom that's also available for sale.",

We said we wanted an order to go and was told to \"go over there\", pointing toward a counter.   The man at the counter took our order and gave us a number. There was no instruction on what to do next, so we asked if the order was to go and he responded, \"no, you didn't tell me that, I'm not a mind reader\". We apologized to him for our apparent misunderstanding of what to do and he took the number back and yelled that it was to go.   After this we stood in the middle of the restaurant waiting for an order with various people asking us to move quite frequently.   This was one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had, and will never return to this place again. I do not recommend it to anyone unless they are prepared to be confused and belittled.",

We ordered the veggie patch and the Avalon crepe. Both tasted good but not exceptionally good for the hype that's given! On the whole an unique place with a decent food!",

Right place, right time!  We got there just in time to snag a two-top inside (not much cooler than out, but better still).  I ordered \"The Crepelet\" (ham, swiss, and egg) and my boyfriend ordered \"The Rosarito\" (guac, chorizo, egg, cheese).  They come with a choice of sliced bananas or cottage cheese and they're HUGE!  I ordered The Crepelet because I wanted something savory without onions, but beware!  The ham has onions and tomatoes kinda on it.  It's not overpowering, but if you're sensitive to onions, keep it in mind.  What's really cool is that the owners are working at the restaurant, so you really get to see that it's a small business!  Another cool thing- you can watch them make your crepe on a tv they have up by the register (you can see it if you're seated inside).  It's really neat to watch them actually make the crepe (not premade and reheated like at IHOP and other places)!    One thing to note: we looked online at the menu before arriving and noticed that the prices online are about 25-50 cents lower than what's listed in store (not a big deal, but maybe you need those quarters!).",

Well I didn't know Crepe Expectations had moved a few doors down from where they were located until I decide to go there yesterday.   I felt a little lost, then confused and was like ohhh there it is....  So long story short I really loved the small &  packed crepe house experience I always got when I ate there.   I loved the fact that I could sit right in front of the window and watch the chefs prepare each and every crepe.   And on a busy weekend morning, it's a mad house and you know why people come here!   Now that Crepe Expectations has moved - it feels so big and on a Weekday morning there may have only been 10 or so tables occupied, it felt empty.   So with my mind still racing about the new venue...I will say this.   I enjoyed my crepe and so did hubby! The service was friendly and prompt and they checked in on us to make sure everything was ok.  Maybe I'll try a weekend next time to see how things go.",

Prior to walking in it's helpful if you know the system at Crepe Expectations. It's seemingly always crowded, so know that you have to get in line and while you're there the friendly staff will try and line up a table for you. It doesn't always work, but they do a heck of a job keeping the operation running smoothly even in the face of lengthy lines. Kudos. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Pretty much everything at Crepe Expectations sits below the $10.00, which is a real bargain given the portion sizes. I opted for the special of the day which was a Green Chili Verde savory crepe, and I ended up with a meal that probably could have fed a person and a half. Good value. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  My Green Chili Verde Chicken crepe was very, very good with fresh ingredients and good flavors that came together in the crepe, but it was my girlfriend's breakfast crepe that was truly spectacular with eggs and breakfast meats from far and wide. Two Stars.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I'll be back to Crepe Expectations to try their array of sweet crepes, but until then I can't for sure say that I'd recommend Crepe Expectations head and shoulder above the various competitors in the area. More to come. No Star.",

When we first found this place it was a little hole in the wall and it was packed, with a line all the way to the door. Mike the manager is a great guy as well as the rest of the staff. The first time we went we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into and we each ordered a savory crepe and then split a dessert crepe. We were so full since the crepes are so big. Now we know better and only order a savory and dessert crepe and share both. They moved almost next door to the original location and expanded and now have more seating with a nice outdoor patio to sit and dine in. I don't see a lot of the original staff but Mike is still there doing a fabulous job running around taking great care of all the customers and I think I heard they might be opening a second location. It seems to me that the girl that was making the crepes when we first went there has left or is no longer making the crepes and because of that I didn't give 5 stars. I think the quality of the crepes were a little off and they were slightly burnt. All and all still a really great place with good food and great people. Get out of the casinos and the buffet lines and go get some real food.",

You pay when ordering and are given a number to put on your table and they bring out your food. Everyone was friendly, quick & efficient.   We ordered the La Jolla, Marco Polo & Chicken Chili Verde. All were delicious and very filling. Plus they each came with a little side. The favorite of the three was the Chicken Verde. I think it was a special but I hope it's always on the menu!

Very clean environment! Staff is amazing and very friendly and helpful. They are very supported of our military as well!!!! Now to the food....huge portions and fresh top quality ingredients. I have been to many establishments that are not half the size and/or quality for a higher cost. They cost is another amazing thing for such quality and quantity!!!! I had the veggie delight with added egg whites gluten free and the Frisco (blue berry and lemon custard) gluten free. You cant eat one in one sitting they are so large!!! The flavors are fresh and well blended. They do not skip what so ever on the size or amount of the ingredients going inside of the crepes! Husband had the greek and berry delight. He was just as happy about his order. We were also always looking for crepes not during breakfast times, well now we have one. This will now be a regular stop for us. We highly recommend you try and will not be disappointed at all!!!",

We tried one savory and one sweet- I got the Rosarita (chorizo, egg, avocado, cheese) and my boyfriend got the Elvis (banana, peanut butter, caramel, bacon). Both were out of this world. Holy cow, I dream of these crepes!! The portions are huge, and it's all you can drink coffee if you decide to get some. I think we paid about $23 in total and we left stuffed!

The atmosphere and decor are pretty depressing, tired looking and in need of some interior design. We ended up eating outside and it was fine until I tried to refill my coffee. The sliding door didn't work and I had to walk around the tables to get back in. Also, the table where the coffee is set on is way in the back where people hover, and I had to walk around tables again just to return outside. Bad planning.   The crepe itself was pretty good but nothing to speak of. I ate The Frisco. My first thought after my food arrived was \"that's it?\"  One measly crepe for $7.50+tax. I could have easily eaten 2 more. The filling was just blueberries. I was expecting them to be prepared a little bit more elaborately, like a compote or some sauce.   Lastly the bathroom. The women's was fine but my husband said the men's was filthy, comparable to a gas station bathroom that hadn't been cleaned in a year.    After eating here I wished I would have had the crepes at Paris hotel's buffet instead.",

The soup I got with the Carne asada crepe was very flavorful as well. Also these guys actually are not afraid of making their asada with a nice kick for some hello in your mouth at breakfast time. The service here was perfect, with the head chef adding a perfect amount of playful banter and information on their dishes. I WILL BE A Regular here.

And, IMHO, under-priced (when do you ever say that in Vegas?). I opted for the Monterrey - bacon, eggs, tomatoes, mild Serrano peppers, onions, and Jack cheese (hope I remembered it all). Absolute perfection for breakfast. It was huge but I managed to eat most of it. It came with cottage cheese or bananas on the side. I went with bananas and the sweetness was a perfect complement. I also got a white peach mimosa - yum!   My only regret is that we didn't hang around in the area for a couple more hours so I could go back for a sweet crepe.",

It's pretty busy but the wait is worth it. I got the chicken chile verde, it was delicious. But, I really like the idea of how the place works, all types of crepes, the desert ones are great. But, breakfast and lunch crepes are delicious too, can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Another solid choice from DDD. Fresh crepes both sweet and savory made to order right in front of you. It's a cute spot with limited seating but has a local feel to it. All of the crepes we had were great and super reasonably priced. Also can't argue with a solid, somewhat strong cup of fresh-brewed coffee with refills.   I ordered the rosarito, which from the description was hard to turn down: guac, chorizo, eggs, and cheese. I'm normally a sweet crepe person but this was really superb. Flavorful, unique, and not too heavy yet filling. Plus it came with a side of bananas! Add some salsa and definitely get Highly it.  The sweet crepes though were also great. We shared the perfect combination (strawberries and chocolate drizzle) and the berry delight (blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries). For those who prefer crepes on the sweeter side, you can't go wrong with either.",

I've never tried any of the sweet crepes but they look amazing. I usually split a meat filled crepe with my friend.  According to the plaque on the wall Guy Fieri visited at some point.

The mimosa trio is such a great bang for your buck as well. The description makes it sound like you'll only get a sample of each flavor you choose, but you really get 3 full mimosas.  During peak meal times, there can be a bit of a wait for a table, but you can enjoy a mimosa while you wait and they're working on a bigger, better location so soon the seating won't even be a problem.",

I can't say enough about how melt in your mouth these both were. Be aware, they are super sweet and worth sharing. However I found myself finishing off mine and then eating my friends too. The warm, tart apples were perfection paired with the caramel drizzle and my nutella was melted perfectly inside the yummy crepe and strawberries. Complimentary water and or cucumber water is served to wash it all down but next time I'll definitely try the mimosas or one of the many sodas.  There is a great selection of dinner crepes too that I'm dying to try!",

    "text": "Driven by this place many times and didn't even know it was there.  Its in a center with a lot of other restaurants.  Its a small location with probably 10 or so tables with a couple more outside.  The place was packed when we got there and this is where the process is a bit weird.  You need to check in with the cashier to put in your name down.  This is the same place you order as well but not until a table is ready.  Sort of a hybrid of the order and pay with open seating and the more traditional sit and then order from a server. Even though there are no servers  the staff roams the floor looking to help where possible.  The only part I didn't like is that waiting for tables is done in the hallway toward the back.  Not much can be done with that though because the place is pretty small.  As for ambiance the location is cozy and has low lighting even during the day.  The crepe stations are up front and open so you can watch the chefs work their magic.  They've even got overhead camera view above so you can watch from the tables.  There are also 2 TVs on the walls which were showing football today which was a pleasant surprise.  The service was friendly both at the cashier and the staff walking around.  The iced tea cups were pretty small which is always a disappointment for me because I drink a lot during the meal.  Fortunately the staff member that brought the tea must have sensed my mood because not only did he ask if we usually drink a lot of tea, when we replied yes he brought a full pitcher and left it at the table just for us. Even better there was plenty of ice in the pitcher so no concern of tea melting the ice in my glass (another pet peeve).  On to the food.  I went breakfast with the rosarito which has chorizo, scrambled eggs, jack cheese and guacamole.  It was quite tasty.  Only thing missing was a bit of salsa on top (maybe some sour cream too).  Also came with either bananas or cottage cheese on the side.  I went with sliced bananas which were a good compliment to the savory crepe.  My wife had the little Italy which was pepperoni, mozzarella, and tomatoes basil sauce.  It was like a pizza in a crepe (thankfully she let me try it as I'll probably get that when I want lunch.) Her crepe came with fidejo soup which was like chicken noodle minis the chicken chunks.  Very good.  We couldn't be pass up a chance for a dessert crepe so we split the monkey which has Nutella, bananas, chocolate, whip cream and we added strawberries.   This was definitely my favorite of the three.   The portions are quite large so we couldn't eat everything. Probably could have split one savory and then the sweet. The crepes were all delicious and it was cool to watch the chefs make them to order too.    To round out the experience both the wait staff and the cashier thanked us for coming in and made sure to ask for us to come back soon.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars was the somewhat awkward waiting in the narrow hallway.  I'm not sure there is much they can do about it though and it will definitely  not deter me from coming back again.  Thanks for the great meal.",

The crepes here are quite delicious, and they have screens so you can watch the crepes being made. Everything tasted really fresh. They have tons of variety, and lots of different drinks too. I got a freshly made strawberry lemonade and a Greek crepe. Everything tastes really fresh and clean, and like a high quality meal. The crepe was stuffed quite full, and by the time I was done eating, so was I.  They also have a lot of different flavors of mimosas, and you can also get a sampler of mimosas and you can try three different flavors.  My one complaint about this place is that it's small and a bit cramped. You order your food at the counter and then you get a number that you put at your table. Problem is, if there are no tables, there's not really a waiting area or anything...so it can get awkward.  Regardless, I need to find an excuse to come back to this place.",

My husband had no problem finishing his crepe which was basically pepperoni pizza inside...

Then before they took a third couple I kindly reminded them we were still waiting. We ordered our food and ended up waiting another 45 minutes. They need a bigger place with more employees to cater to guest. I do have to take my hat off to the one solo girl making crepes, she worked her butt off putting food together and it was great. Don't go here if your in a hurry or if you have less than 2 hours to spend eating. Would love to give them 5 stars but get your shizzz together and get organized!",

    "text": "This place is just spot-on in so many ways...  The decor is pleasant and unexpected with a personality all its own (and no country or breakfast theme -- man I hate \"barnyard\" decor).  The owners are sweethearts (Lou took my order today with an enthusiastic \"Talk to me, Goose!\" and tends to refer to everyone in terms of endearment).  The drink selection is impressive (premium sodas, beers, wines, coffee/espresso drinks, and at least 13 flavors of mimosas -- my favorites are passion fruit, guava, and blood orange).  The food is just awesome, no other way to describe it. I used to think I hated crepes, but this place has made a believer out of me. I can't vouch for the sweet ones since I'm not a sweets person, but the savory & breakfast crepes are effing genius. My favorites are the Sonora (carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, jack cheese) and the Monterey (bacon, scrambled egg, tomato, red onion, serrano pepper, jack cheese). If you get a breakfast crepe, you can choose sliced bananas or cottage cheese as your side. If you get a savory/lunch crepe, you can choose soup (usually fideo) or a green salad with vinaigrette. Don't let that description fool you into thinking the salad is boring, though -- the dressing is homemade by Lou and has a base of cumin, lime, & garlic (my kind of dressing!!). OMGYUM.  I heard they're looking to open another location on the other side of town. As long as this one doesn't go anywhere, that's allllll right with me.",

My dad opts for The Monterey -- hold the monterey (he doesn't eat cheese). My mom's goto is the Marco Polo. And my sister is a complete fiend for the Ana Bananas Foster. Seriously! She won't share!  Of course we always try to try different crepes (Also recommend The Caprese or The Avalon! Yum!), but we've come to the conclusion that you really can't go wrong here.  AND! They have a cute little station for the Sunday morning doggies who want to grab a bite too! Haven't brought my pup yet cause I'm not sure if she can behave herself around the crepes!  Larry and Ana are extremely gracious hosts who do everything they can to ensure your experience at Crepe Expectations exceeds your great expectations. (And they recognized me as a guest when we ran into each other at a supermarket! That's hospitality!)",

    "text": "Forget the Strip when you're in the mood for crepes!  These folks have it down to a science (and art)!  Plus, they're extremely friendly, accomodating, and gracious.  Crepe Expectation's crepes are large and packed with only FRESH ingredients.  They're all made to order right before your very eyes and adjustments to ingredients are well received.  Ana has this graceful technique when she makes your crepes.  I was so mesmerized on her skill, that I actually thought I could spread crepe batter at home as perfectly as her (yeah right, lol).  Speaking of they're batter, it contains no extra salt or sugar, so it's perfect for entree or dessert crepes.  Menu-wise, they have crepes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert!  DINNER: I can't believe it's taken me so long to write a review for this restaurant!  It's been so long that I can only remember that I had a breakfast crepe filled with scrambled egg, cheese, and breakfast meats.  So delish,  filling, and comforting!  The hubby had The Sonora which was carne asada, cheese, roasted tomato salsa, and guacamole.  He loved it so much he came back the next day for lunch with three coworkers.  DESSERT: We were soooo full by the end of our dinner that I almost had to unbutton my jeans.  Somehow, we made room for desserts.  Yes, desserts with an \"s\" on the end; not a shared dessert; two individual dessertS!!!  I got the Perfect Combination with a heaping full of fresh strawberries, fresh whipped cream, chocolate drizzle, and powdered sugar.  Hubby got the William Tell which was sauteed apples, caramel, fresh whipped cream, and powdered sugar.  WOW!  The restaurant itself is located in a large strip mall next to the indoor exotic car dealership.  It's small inside but, every space is well utilized.  That being said, the building does face the west, so during the evenings the sun is blaring in, making the restaurant on the warm side.  The color inside is mainly black and purple (eggplant'ish), accented with marble, stone, and glass, very classy and contemporary in my opinion.  Somehow, they managed to fit in a small coffee station where sugar, honey, creamer, tap water, and cucumber water (complementary) are available.  Speaking of coffee, they are also a full service \"coffee house\", serving (Illy's I think???) cappuccino, espresso, latte, coffee, and hot teas.  Feeling a little tipsy?  They also have beer and wine!  All other beverages are bottled, including sodas, juices, and waters.   Last but not least, Crepe Expectations does have a few outside tables and welcomes canine patrons with an outside bin of complementary doggy biscuits.  Have a Crepe Day!",

    "text": "Yelps 365 Review Challenge - Los Angeles #9 - #365  I was looking to have a not so heavy breakfast with my friend Ian A. and decided to buy some donuts, then he suggested Crepe Expectations. I've had Crepes before but early in the morning was a bit unusual for me. It's located in a strip mall and offers patio seating where you can enjoy the sunny skies of Las Vegas while enjoying the savory goodness.   Checking the menu, I decided to go with a dessert Crepe instead of breakfast.   I ordered, \"The Perfect Combination\" - $7.50:  +Fresh Strawberries +Chocolate Drizzle +Fresh Whipped Cream +Powdered Sugar  For my drink, I ordered the, \"Mixed Berry Fuzed\" - $2.00   The best thing about the drink was it was bottomless and tasted very refreshing. The place was packed so we couldn't find any open patio seats, so indoors it was. It just shows how popular Crepe Expectations is, just like In n Out (Burger Wise), this place has a staple with my sweet tooth!",

Today was windy so we decided to eat indoors, the turnover is pretty quick since all they're serving is pretty much crepes which don't take too long to prepare.  We ordered a strawberry and mango mimosa, veggie patch crepe and the nutty classic crepe.  While waiting you can watch on the tv screen your crepe being prepared in real time.  I was thinking my Nutella crepe would be super sweet so I helped myself to the cucumber water (they also had lemon water) while we were waiting.  The crepe actually wasn't that sweet at all, overall I enjoyed the food, the infused water and the quaint dining room, our cashier was also really nice and knowledgeable which made our entire experience here great.  We will return and try more crepes!  They have about 13 varieties of mimosas and they serve beer!",

Luckily, located in what's quickly becoming my favorite shopping center, Crepe Expectations specializes in the craft. While the place is small (maybe 8 tables?), their menu boasts 23 ways you can eat this thinny pancake. I scooped up The Sunday Morning (scrambled eggs, seasoned potatoes, jack cheese and bacon added) and it was way better than expected. These things are large and the perfect size for lunch. With flavored waters and a side salad included, this is solid deal for under $8. Def worth a try for a croob (crepe noob) or crexpert (you get it).",

The deliciousness of the monkey crepe I got made up for it. Along with the awesome friendly people that worked there. There mimosas are great. The mango mimosa I tried was wonderful along with the mango fresh squeezed lemonade of the day I tried, was very refreshing.   I think they should really expand! Because it gets really full in there. The booths, seats, and tables are pretty close to each other so you can pretty much here the conversation of the family of four next to you. The seats are super comfortable though which is a plus.    It was a little hard for me to find since my GPS was telling me to turn on Hardin a street that didn't even exist. So I called in and it's a machine that talks to you but the operator successfully gave me directions. It's in the big plaza where BJ'S is.",

I had the Rosarito and thought it was great. The crepe was thin yet had noticeable texture, the chorizo was tasty and the guacamole added a nice creamy element to the meal. Both of my friends crepes looked appetizing as well (Greek & Sonora?) and both commented on enjoying their meal enough that they'd definitely be back. Oh, and the cucumber & lemon water was neat for a change.   The location is on the smaller side but the decor and atmosphere fit with the overall coziness of the building.

The food is great, and I do think it's a good value if you do not buy all the overpriced beverages. I think the new (current) owner thinks pretty highly of himself-he spent like 15 minutes talking to me at my table (on a non busy day, 2 yrs ago) about how he is a real chef and was going to add menu items, etc. I think that's great (no new notable items have been added since original owner tho), but bottom-line, if you can't care for your loyal customers, in a timely manner, you will ultimately lose your customers.  I visited yesterday, a Tuesday, and arrived/placed my order 9:40 am. I waited 25 minutes to receive my order. The party that ordered after me got their order about 7-10 minutes before me. The couple that ordered before me received their food in less than 15 mins. I had to ask where my order was. The cashier who took my order said she would have to check. It came about 5 minutes after my asking. I ask the person who delivered it, what the delay was. She said they were just really backed up. I asked why the party who ordered after me already had and well on their way to eating half their plates. She said she would need to check. She came back and said it was because they ordered sweet (vs. savory crepe). Not a great reason IMO. And no apology for my wait of 25 minutes for a crepe!, on a Tuesday morning, with only one party ordering in front of my order. Seems really unreasonable.   After being a loyal customer for years, I will not return. I will need to find another great crepe place in the Valley that values their customers.",

    "text": "This place ROCKS from the decor to the crepes!!!  The owner is exactly what an owner should be, present, charming and helpful!!  He loves his business and it shows!!  He was helping his customers get a table and offering suggestions all with a smile on his face.    The Mimosa selection is plentiful and I'm looking forward to trying it when I return on Sunday.  As was the coffee selection!  Let's get down to the crepes since that's what you are here for!!  I had the ? with walnuts, pears and goat cheese.  It came with a side of whip cream which I thought was strange up until the moment I tried it and found it complicated the crepe extremely well.  The crepe itself was delicious.  The selected ingredients were good but I would definitely try a different selection before I made my way back to this one.  My kids had the berry one, LOVED it and my son had the Perfect Combination which I know he loved when I saw him licking the plate.  Come with an appetite because these crepes are huge!!  The homemade Strawberry Lemonade was the best I ever had!  Watch your crepe being made on the TV!!  Free Lemon water and free cucumber water!",

I met the owner of the restaurant he seems like a very cool guy. Inside is a little squeeze, they also have seats outside. It's a fun place to grab a quick bite. I'll definitely recommend. The crew is aware of their guests. Great service. There's also a tv to watch them make your food.",

    "text": "I was in France for a week, earlier this year. My brother had regaled me for years with stories of delicious crepe carts on every corner as far as the eye could see. But alas it was not so. Out of maybe 6 or 7 places we stopped at, only one was worth coming back to, and when I did return (the next day actually) they were closed. \"Seriously?! On a Sunday?!\"  I came home utterly devastated. More so in commiseration with my wife, an avid crepe connoisseur,  for whom the word \"crepes\" had been number three on her list of reasons we needed to see Paris.   I would never have imagined that we had a place that served Crepes, better than any we had on our travels, and that it was right down the street at Crepe Expectations.    I recommend you try one savory and one sweet, like the berry crepe with lemon custard along with the egg and bacon crepe. I forget the names. Also, since it's cold out, I believe you can sub a soup for one of the side orders. I didn't see it on the menu and there might be an additional cost, but I saw a few people order it and their reaction seemed favorable. Also, while your at it, treat yourself to a flight of mimosas, a sampler of three glasses of champagne with fruit juice. As I recall, the Pineapple mimosa was my favorite of the three I last ordered.   ( I could not help myself from writing this review as if I were some kind of fancy gentlemen. But honestly this place is good tasting, high quality food, and they work hard to provide the best service they can, despite the high volume and small space. Expect to wait a little while for a table, but if it's empty take your time and enjoy it! )",

    "text": "This cozy little place serves a large menu with crepes that will satisfy anyones desire.   There is breakfast crepes, veggie crepes, and sweet crepes.  They even have a few savory crepes, so walking in and looking at the menu can be a little overwhelming, unless of course you already know what you want.  I wanted to look further, but the place was packed, we were in line, and I had to pick something right away.  The only available place to sit was outside, thus I couldn't continue to study the menu.   I picked a sweet crepe, I got the Berry Delight, made with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries, fresh whipped cream, and a light sprinkle of powder sugar.  It was yummy!  The berries were plumb and sweet, the crepe itself was delicious.  I would love to take another look at the entire menu and maybe try something other than sweet, I don't think they have a slow time, but I think that's what it's going to take for me to review everything the offer.",

    "text": "What a great place! Crepe Expectations is the perfect brunch spot. It's in a huge strip mall. You might even miss it snuggled up against other shops. The word Crepe stands out and your eye will immediately see the outside tables set under canopies.    It was my mother-in-laws birthday and I knew she would love this place. We placed our orders with the chef. I ordered the Rosarito. My mom-in-law had the Monterey. The other people in my group went with the Ana Bananas Foster. I love that with the savory crepes you can pick from bananas or cottage cheese. Since you pay and then pick your seat we were going to sit outside, but bees started bothering us so we moved inside. Which was great because you can watch the chef on a flat screen tv make your crepes. I really loved that feature. Our crepes came out and were so pretty and even better tasty! My Rosarito had spicy chorizo, guacamole, eggs and cheese. What a great combo. The crepe itself is light and the perfect vessel for just about anything. My mom-in-law really enjoyed hers as well. (Yay!)  As for Crepe Expectations drinks. Get the mimosa sampler! It's three glasses of champagne with your choice of juices! For only $10! I loved the cherry juice. It's a wonderful combo with any of the crepes.  I love this place. Except for the bees. Watch out if you choose to sit outside. On the weekends it gets packed so be prepared to wait, but it's so worth it. Another great place! I must credit my fellow Yelper Jessie B for clueing me in to this place. Yum, crepes!",

After we did that, we got some water and went back to our table where we proceeded to wait over half an hour before we got our 2 dishes. The first few bites tasted good and after that it was just meh.   My bf's dish didn't look to appetizing, almost like they did it so sloppily on purpose. My dish was quite dry for a chorizo crepe. i did enjoy the bananas though! lol.   There were also huge flies inside the restaurant because the doors were constantly being opened and closed so that was annoying.   I don't think we will come back here to eat, esp being that it's so expensive.",

My friend was having a bad day so we stopped in at 2:30 today. We were promptly and rudely told outside the front door that they close at 3 and would be \"kicked out\" if we were not done with our food by then. I understand the kitchen closing early so they can clean up but being told I had to leave promptly at 3 by an employee was totally out of line! If I'm going to pay $45 for two people to enjoy lunch I want to be able to actually enjoy it.   I know this isn't the philosophy of the owners and was sad I was \"greeted\" outside the front door by this rude man, because he saved me some money!   Sad that such an amazing place is ruined by a grumpy employee. Maybe time to freshen up the staff a bit?",

Finally, I set up a girls day with my friend and we started out here first!  I ordered the Greek Crepe and we both ordered the trio mimosa sampler.  My crepe was kinda dry and over cooked, the flling was overkilled with too much Feta ( its all I could taste) and chicken that was so dry I opened my crepe up and pulled the peices out. :-(.  My trio mimosas were also way too syrupy and not mixed at all, maybe they forgot to mix them cause the syrup was sitting at the bottom of all of them.  I dont know, maybe the sweet crepes are worth a shot!  There's just too many other crepe places in town.",

My only knock is the dark interior but the last time I checked, I'm not an interior designer and this all about the food and service which were both fantastic. It was very clean and modern inside and they even had a tv showing your crepes being made. The other great thing was that they served Illy Coffee and free refills, thats pretty awesome. Anna and the rest of the staff were super friendly and constantly checked up on us, I will definitely be a regular at this spot! In regards to the food, my wife and I shared one of each of the breakfast, savory and sweet. The crepes were thin, light and held up very well with the fresh fillings...so good!",

We got the Sonora (carne asada, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, and jack cheese) and split it because we weren't really hungry. But it was so delicious!! The crepe also came with some fruit on the side. I like how they are specialized in crepes and not 10 different things and their menu may be short but from our Sonora crepe; I bet all the crepes on the menu are good too. The decorations inside gave you a chic feel to it. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful but the owners told us we came after the rush hour. We both talked to the owners and they were really nice. We found out that they make everything in the kitchen fresh every day. They're trying to make their own hummus. Outside they have some food and water so it's good if you want to bring your dog or cat with you. Although in the heat, I think the water would be boiling. We live on the other side of the town but we are definitely going back the next chance we get. Especially when we did get to try the dessert crepes.",

Topped off with the mimosa trio - - I chose tangerine, watermelon and white peach for my indulgence - - it was a beautiful Sunday morning.  Was truly impressed to see the owner manning the register and taking orders like a champ.  Staff was beyond busy, but wonderfully friendly.  Only nose wrinkling moment was at how, shall we say, \"cozy\" the space is.  People were literally packed in line so densely that the servers couldn't get around them to deliver drinks/meals.  But that is again a testimate to how delicious their food is....we were all willing to wait.  It is so fantastic to finally have fabulous, locally owned restaurants in our neighorhood!",

Yes, the crepes are decent, but until they have meaningful business hours, their rating will remain low in my book. After all this is Vegas, where the best fun starts after sunset...",

This trip it was my first stop, straight from the airport for lunch. Once again I got the Del Mar ($9) shrimp & zucchini crepe and it was delicious. It was loaded with shrimp and tasted very fresh with a light butter sauce. My friend got the Sonora ($9) carne asada crepe and was amazed at how good it was. She loved how the slightly browned exterior of the crepe gave it texture against the hardy filling.  Be sure to check out the \"Crepe Cam\" over the cooking station so you can watch your food being made. Also, love that they have complimentary flavored water available that you can help yourself to. Just wish they were open in the evening so we could stop by for a dessert crepe after a day of gambling/sightseeing.   This place is a definite must for visitors and locals alike.

Although when you hear why they close early, it makes it a bonus not a drawback. This is a great place! A great locals place, that makes you feel special, and is unique. I will be back.",

The soup is great. Even the cucumber water is great.  This is one of our highly recommended places to take our visitors from out of town, and so far have excelled each and every time. The seating is a bit cramped and crowded, especially in winter/summer when it's not seasonal to sit outside. The staff is always very accommodating in getting people situated, so rather than feeling like it's a bad thing you feel taken care of.  It has consistently been a great and not very costly meal.",

I got one of the crepes with egg because it was breakfast time.

I have yet to try their mimosas but their fresh fruit juices are always great. I generally will get partake in the fruit juice with my savory crepes, the Sonora being one of my favorites.

I suggest \"The La Jolla\" for a Savory Crepe. It's like a BLT with guacamole and a tasty chipotle mayo spead. I always add turkey and I highly recommend it! For a sweet crepe, I'm addicted to \"The Avalon\". This one has pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts and honey. They offer different fun flavors of mimosas and you can order a trio to taste a few. The coffee is excellent! I always get a White Mocha and in the warmer months get it iced. Yum yum yum!    This place is family owned and everyone there is very kind. It's an order at the counter joint, they give you a number, you pick a table and they bring your food out to you. However, weekends are quite busy and you have to put your name down on wait list for table. They always have refreshing Cucumber and Lemon water out while you wait. Enjoy!",

    "text": "My husband and I tried this place on a Sunday morning after deciding we should probably eat something before going to the farmer's market. Given the decor I was a little skeptical the place would be pretty expensive but the person behind the register was so welcoming and friendly I would have felt guilty walking out. Good thing we stayed, upon closer inspection the prices were quite reasonable.  My husband orderd the greek crepe which came with either his choice of soup or salad and I ordered the special which was bbq pulled pork with with a side of apple and blue cheese coleslaw. I have lived in Texas and I do love me some slow cooked meat but I am not a fan of bbq sauce. No problem they were more than happy to put it on the side. My husband's crepe was huge, the veggies inside were very fresh and maintained a bit of their crispness. He loved it and said it filled him up, which believe me is no easy feat. My crepe was delicious also, the pulled pork truly did rival what you would find at a good bbq in Texas. The slaw which had intrigued me enough to order the dish did not disappoint. I could have eaten a plate of that by itself.  One of the best things was the free flavored waters they had. Cucumber or lemon. I don't know if they change out the flavorings but I love flavored water and the fact that it was free made the place even more affordable. The place was small and had televisions on Food Network with the sound either very low or off. It was very busy but at no time was it so loud that I had trouble having a conversation with my husband.",

    "text": "The Skinny: solid crepes, drinks are very good (4) service: it's counter service but the bevie bar is the best! (4) value: even though the tea is really pricey ($4 for a teabag in a pot, yikes!), they've got endless refills of illy coffee for around $3 and $10 for a trio of mimosas. That's value (4).  I brought my out of town friends here for a little Sunday morning breakfast. As we first walked in, they loved the hip colour scheme and the comfortable seating area. Add in the video screen to watch your crepe being made, we were really feeling the love.  The owners strategically placed large containers of flavoured (lemon and cucumber) iced water, self-serve coffee, and condiments on a cute little bevie counter. I loved this feature - so much more convenient for customers to be able to help themselves. The only thing I would like to see added is a canister for refilling hot water for teapots.  I also enjoyed the fact that the menu is varied and offers not only sweet but savory crepes for those who aren't really into sweets. They also offer gluten free crepes as well. Prices range from $5.50 (simple sugar crepe) to $9 (crepes with steak or shrimp in it) with the majority of their specialty crepes falling around the $7 mark. Trust me, for the quality and the ambience, it's definitely worth it.  We each got a Monkey crepe - you know - the standard nutella/banana combination. I have to say, it's one of the better crepes I've had in a while. It had a nice texture with it's lovely brown crispiness on the outside which pared well with its molten chocolate hazelnut filling. Truer to the French styled creperie (a little more butter content, a little thinner and less spongy) than other places (lots of Asian creperies around), it's a really solid rendition of a culinary classic.  I was a little taken aback by the prices for tea. $4 for a teabag in a pot seemed a little steep for my tastes although the Earl Grey was nicely mellow with lovely floral hints when I tried it.  Too bad I don't like coffee because the real steal here is the self-serve bottomless cup of illy coffee for less than $3. Yep! it's like the best deal in town for a quality cup of joe. My friend  was amazed at how good it was (\"it's so smooth!\")and had at least 3 giant cups (\"can I get another cup? We're not in a rush, are we?\") before she left. Beat that Starbucks!  Given my excellent experience here, I'll be sure to drag the hubs back here to try their savory crepes and mimosas.",

Forget Paris and any other so-called french places for breakfast/brunch. The crepes are really good. So guess what? If they are busy, you may have to wait. In a super-hurry? Eat a bowl of cold Captain Crunch at home or grab a hot pocket on the way to the dollar store, Genghis! The food is made here, on site, by a real chef who cares what goes over the counter. I have only had great food here. If you seek a $5.99 meal, go hit some dive-ass buffet at Slots O Fun or somesuch. I prefer to get good food made by a pro who cares, not someone with a bad a attitude and a flaky scalp. This guy is on top of his game.",

There could be a wait to be seated and maybe a little longer for your order but they haven't disappointed yet. Order ahead, take it to go, but for mimosas you have to stay. They don't take your order at the table, you order at the counter and find a seat which is the only down but it's still WORTH IT. They have flavored cold water you could serve yourself also. It's worth it for us San Diegans.",

I won't be going back. The... Owner, I believe? Just incessantly called us \"baby\" and \"doll\" and \"sweetheart\" and \"honey\" etc as we ordered, which was a little overwhelming/patronizing (we are both nearly 30) but I put up with it. My friend went to get coffee from the coffee bar, and I sat down at the table. When she came over to sit she said to me \"WOW I'll take a side of harassment with my crepes, huh? That's... Old school!\" I agreed that being called all those pet names was a bit disconcerting, at which point she told me he had actually come up behind her with the coffee refill and put his arm around her while telling her \"atta girl\" as she filled up her coffee. I apologized profusely and explained that I never had this treatment when visiting with my boyfriend, and I will NOT be returning.",

Highly worth the drive from Strip to get a good meal.   Reasonable prices.",

It's kind of winter now so outside dining isn't quite that pleasant this time of year. There are a few people that help you get seated and clear tables, but they aren't actual waiters since you have to go to the counter to place your order, but they do bring your food out to you using the number system, they are very helpful and friendly. The menu is very extensive and the many different choices can stop a newcomer in their tracks. We ordered off the breakfast menu and all was just perfect. You can watch them make the crepes right in front of you and the ladies do a very nice job, so many choices on fillings. They also have a large dispenser of cucumber water and lemon water for free or you can have wine, mimosas or various bottled soda pops. The crepes are traditional or exotic, but always good, we just wish there was more seating. Congrats to them, they have a nice following and we are included.",

We have tried many places in Vegas,  Quebec, Montreals, Canada. Good selection for sweet creeps and regular breakfast and lunch style crepes. Saw the Greek salad crepes, and look so good. Friendly staffs, clean, and good selection of different water that you have to serve yourself. They put cucumber and lemon in a water pitcher that you can serve yourself. There were one more but does not remember. They are very busy on the weekends according to a staffer. There are line of people waiting. I gave a four instead of five, because you kind of have to serve yourself with water. Not sure if this a restaurant, restaurant or a Starbucks type. They bring you your food at the table. I tip like I would at a restaurant, but you have a server at the restaurant. This is not a big deal. We would come back, nd recommend to our friends.",

The vegetables were freshly cut and grilled, combined with a tangy hummus, it was delicious. Since it was so light and low-cal, I decided to order the Berry Delight for dessert and a delight it was! It was worth the 25 miles I traveled to get there, so more visits are planned to satisfy my gastro-cravings and to enjoy the home/family comfy feelings felt while dining.  Larry and Ana, the owners, are cordial and ready to please. Don't miss out on this treat. It's like sitting in Mama's kitchen.",

    "text": "OMG.  There really aren't enough \"OMG\"s to go around to describe this place, but OMG!!!!!!!!!!  Me and my girlfriends came to Vegas 2 weeks ago to celebrate a birthday.  One of my friends, ever the planner, found out about this place via Yelp and her eyes popped out of her socket when she saw the Mimosa Trio Sampler on the menu.  'Nuff said.  We were definitely going to visit when we got to Vegas.  Oh, they have crepes, too?  That's cool.  So we touch down in Vegas at the abysmal hour of 10:00am (!) and proceed to Crepe Expectations.  There was a total of 4 of us so we decided to get 2 breakfast crepes, 2 sweet crepes, and then we would just split them all.  The 2 breakfast crepes that we ordered were the Monterey Crepe and the Rosarito Crepe.  I can't...I just can't.  I'm getting a headache now just thinking about HOW GOOD that ish was.  Really?  Really?!  The cheese was gooey and everything was so flavorful.  My friends were debating which crepe was better of the two.  At that point I'm like, \"Who gives a f@ck?!\"  They were both blowing my mind!  Cut to the 2 sweet crepes: Bananas Foster and Perfect Combination.  The Bananas Foster ruled HANDS DOWN!  God I wanted to lick that plate.  But on to better things:  THE MIMOSA TRIO SAMPLER!!!  We EACH got a sampler, so yes, 12 mimosas were on our table.  I ordered the orange (yes I stay True to the original, thank you very much), white peach and passion fruit.  When you order the passion fruit they provide a little spoon for you to mix the drink with.  There are also several other flavors to choose from as well.  I thought that the white peach and passion fruit were too sweet, but the orange?  JUST RIGHT.  And DON'T call me boring because the orange was my favorite.  I just appreciate the classics, that's all.  They're in pretty small glasses, so....yes, I ordered another sampler.  What?  Don't judge.  But when I ordered the second sampler, Mike, who I believe is the owner and totally AWESOME in every way, gave me the rest of the champagne that was left and told me to go to town.  And go to town we did.  When we were done licking our plates and boozing it up, Mike proceeded to bring us free bowls of soup!  What the hell?!  Mike, we love you!!!!  So we stumbled out of Crepe Expectations at 12 noon (yes, we had been there that long) with our bellies full and our sobriety greatly compromised.  Three cheers and 5 stars all around for Crepe Expectations!!",

    "text": "Came into Crepe Expectations with high expectations especially since when we walked in we noticed a sign indicating it was it on Food Network. We were seated quickly and handed menus and tins to get up and order at the counter when ready. That wasn't a issue with us. The restaurant is small but cozy, and ha mostly high top tables which I enjoy since I'm rather teller. On the side are some bench style seats wit chairs on the other side. Not really too good for big groups of more then 4 people.  Back to our experience. We ordered The Little Italy Crepe and the Caprese chicken Crepe with grilled chicken. Took exactly 20 minutes from time of receipt to time of food being delivered to our table. That was extremely long since it wasn't busy. All other tables already had their food. So why the length of time? Unsure.  The Caprese salad Crepe was flavorless, with huge chunks of tomatoes and chicken in it, but the pieces were not cut into bite size or manageable pieces plus the lack of chicken for the extra dollar was appalling. The Crepe itself was tasty, and would be good with a sweet Crepe.  The Little Italy Crepe was over filled with tomato sauce, using that as the star ingredient. Tasty but then again it seemed like it was just tomato sauce only.  Manager or owner was floating around saying hello and thank you to everyone but managed every time to forget us. Maybe because we didn't buy a bottle of wine or champagne...smh.  Overall the ambience of this restaurant is cute and cozy but the food lacks everything. Try somewhere else.",

My wife and I were greeted at the door by the friendly staff, and even though it was fairly busy, we were able to find a seat right away at a shared table.   Everything on the menu looked great, and we eventually decided to share a savory breakfast crepe and and a sweet crepe. The Rosarito is a delicious blend of chorizo, scrambled egg, guacamole and jack cheese, and I highly recommend it for anyone who likes their food with a little kick. We followed it up with the Berry Delight, which is as delightful as it sounds.   In addition to the great good, the place has a great atmosphere and service. When you get a chance, drop in.

Portions are generous and servers are prompt and cordial.

    "text": "If I could give this place zero stars, I would.   Not only is it overrated, but over priced and run by the most rude people.   My first mistake was going on a Saturday. My girlfriend say the overwhelming, yet over zealous, reviews on Yelp and wanted to go. Upon entering we realized they were packed! We waited in line for a while with a family behind us that we made small talk with. We got to the counter and that's when it started, our horrible experience. It's a Crepe place, right? Well, anyone who has had crepes before knows they are not very filling. Seeing their menu, I was confused as to whether or not they had a full crepe meal. Second mistake: asking the owner/chef a question.   The owner was running the cash register when we went to place our order and I asked a simple question: \"Do the crepes come in a meal?\" Seems like a simple question to which there should be a simple answer, nope. The reply I got was \"I don't understand your question. I have stuffed crepes...\" So I asked again, this time I explained myself. I wanted a meal, with eggs, bacon, hashbrowns...something other than one, thin crepe. The reply I got was much worse the second time around. He asked, \" What does it say on the menu? Read it to me.\" And that's when my jaw hit the floor. Did this a**hole just ask me if I could read?! Did he just insult me for entering his establishment?! Am I going to jail for putting this mans face on a hot skillet?!   In disbelief, I ordered a number one and did not walk out like I wanted to. My girlfriend wanted to stay and continue our nice (until now) Saturday. We ordered two crepes and a mimosa flight. The bill came to over thirty dollars! I not only paid for NOTHING but paid to be insulted. Then it took 45 minutes to get our food. The meal was only two crepes and watered down mimosa's. We were hungry within an hour after eating and pissed that we had to wait so long.  Not worth it. The family that had ordered behind us were still waiting for their food when we left.   This place might be trendy, and have neat decor, but it's small, doesn't have A/C (IN VEGAS!!), and is very over priced. Don't bother.",

When we finally got up to order the gentleman at the register took a whole order on the phone without even saying excuse me or anything. We had been waiting for a couple minutes in line and the phone rang and that order came before us. As I waited for the cashier to finish taking the phone order I noticed the place looked like it had not had a deep cleaning in months. The walls have splatter of food, there is trash on the ground, stains on the ground, and it just looks dirty. After placing my order with the cashier I went to the restroom. The restroom was just as bad if not worse than a gas station restroom .. my guess is it probably hasn't been cleaned in months as well. I was completely disgusted. After my bathroom experience and as I was walking back to my table I saw and noticed the kitchen door open and not to my surprise it was also dirty!  I saw a collection of dirty towels in a basket ( I believe these are the towels they use to wipe up the crepe mix from order to order). As I'm sitting there waiting for my food (which by this point I was thinking I might not eat) I look over and see one of the \"chefs\" wiping his sweat off  his head as he talked to some customers sitting in the crepe bar area. I continued to see if he would go and wash his hands after but he didn't and proceeded to serve plates and take them out to other customers. All in all, not the five star experience I expected from such a highly rated food place.",

From a sweet tooth to a hearty meal they have it. I cannot pick a favorite because every item I have ever had there is amazing and excellently crafted.  CE is located in a very big wide open plaza with a lot of dinning options. The kicker here is that they have limited hours. Only open to 3pm so you really have to get there early. Best time to visit is during the week as weekends are absolutely crazy there. Great sign for the business, bad sign of you are seeking a crepe fix fast. The service is great for not actually having a server but the register/cooks are always approachable and helpful. Any menu item can be changed to suit your taste buds.",

We were quickly seated upon our arrival, despite the place being pretty busy. The manager (possibly owner?) was really friendly and spoke to us for a few minutes after we sat down. He let us know the lay of the land and made some recommendations as well. I ended up ordering the vegetable savory crepe and added a couple of eggs to make it a bit more substantial and more of a breakfast-type crepe.  The crepe itself was well made, and with the 2 added eggs, was a perfect portion size for me and came with a side of bananas, cottage cheese, or a third more lunch-y option that I can't remember right now. I also tried my buddy's crepe, which was the bananas foster  option. It was pretty tasty as well--definitely more of a dessert-type option.  I like the setting. There's a nice covered patio area on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. The inside is light, and you can watch the crepes being made through a glass shield. It's a lively place, though a bit small, so it seems like it could get a little noisy.  Solid breakfast/brunch option. I'd come back.",

I started at the top of the menu and worked my way through the whole thing. Loved it all. Lou, the owner, is a great guy and super friendly. Mike is always busting his butt to keep everything flowing properly. All the Crepes are so good. They feel like you're eating light but I never leave hungry. The amount of filling in the Crepes is perfect. Can't wait to see what the new year brings.",

    "text": "Such a lovely little place! It is not your typical crepe shop that's decored with white walls and contemporary furniture. This crepe shop has a whole lot of personality that screams black and purple. Its very intimate and romantic (great for sunday brunch dates or coffee shop dates. Wink wink fellas!)  It is a petite shop, and you better believe the seats never stay empty! There is also an outdoor seating area which is a nice spot to have Saturday breakfast when all the cool vintage cars are parked outside. It makes a great start for conversation!  I came with my mom who absolutely adores this place (if my mom is willing to a take a trip down to this area then you know its for a good reason!)   She ordered the Berry Delight crepe ($7.50) and you get the berry works! It includes blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries with whipped cream on top. Its berry delightful! (Insert drum roll here) If you don't want a sweet and heavy crepe this would be a great option. Its filled with fruit, which won't be filling to your tummy. I picked the Monkey ($6.50). It's a typical choice for me since my favorite crepe includes nutella, bananas, and strawberries. The Monkey has bananas, nutella, and whipped cream. I also added strawberries as an additional ingredient. I intent to come back again, and step outside of the box to try the rest of the menu items. They also have great Savory Menu with crepe items that have pepperoni, spinach, mozarella, tomato ingredients, and more!  Lastly, a great pair with our crepes was the Mimosa Trio Sampler ($10.00) which provides your choice of three various mimosas to taste that you can pick from the menu. Its a perfect sample size especially if you're in it for taste and less on getting crunk in the AM or afternoon. (Fellas this would be a fun option if you bring a date with you! Hint. Hint) We chose the blood orange, guava, and cherry mimosa to sample. My favorite was the blood orange! Filled with a variety flavors on the menu and they are all such original selections. I never knew that there was a variety of ways to make mimosas besides OJ until now!  How fun! You can watch them make your crepe on the tv as well. So you know exactly when your order is coming! It's a great family owned business and they are all so helpful with assisting you in making a decision. They really know how to be welcoming and feel like you're right at home. I can't wait to go back!",

I had a very difficult time deciding which one to order because several looked soooooooo good. I finally decided to stick with a Vegas theme, and ordered the \"Elvis\" which is banana, peanut butter, caramel, and bacon. Served with whipped cream on top. Oh my....sweet and decadent. Delicious.   As I sat down to eat, the restaurant filled up with a line of 10 and soon all the tables were full. It's very popular, and I know why. The man at the counter was really friendly, he even brought out two ice teas instead of one because he knew I'd need it.",

I'm so glad my friend suggested this restaurant because I've been in this complex a dozen times and can't believe I totally missed it. We were greeted immediately and decided to sit outdoors since we had a dog with us. All the staff was so friendly, and they even brought out a water dish and Woof Gang Bakery treats for our furry friend.  We walked inside to the counter and chose our sweet, savory, or breakfast crepes. I opted for the Sonora (steak, salsa, guac, cheese), while my friend ordered the Banana Fosters, and we split the Mimosa Trio Sampler. The lemon water & cucumber water is self-serve inside. The crepes were definitely delicious and I LOVED the crispy edges since it had such a nice taste to it. The portion was perfect and I also had a soup of the day which paired with my savory choice.  I cannot WAIT to come back to try the rest of the menu. Keep up the amazing work, Crepe Expectations.. I know I can EXPECT nothing less than greatness ;)",

    "text": "I had high expectations for Crepe Expectations, but the experience was just ok. We decided to dine outside because they are dog friendly, but unfortunately their patio furniture doesn't get any sunlight (even mid morning).  Seeing all the different crepe combinations was fun, but when we actually got out crepes we didn't really expect all of the ingredients to be minimal. For example, instead of using actual fruit or berries, it was a puree version.   The caramel latte was pretty good and was served in a large wide mouth cup, which cooled down pretty fast. The rest of our party ordered coffee (they had you a mug to fill out own), and they easily exchanged the chipped mugs for betters ones when we asked.  Overall, Crepe Expectations would be a great place to come back later in the day when it's not as cold and when I'm not expecting a full meal to hold me over. I'd love to try their mimosas on a lazy Sunday.   Yelp 100 Challenge 2014 - 20 of 100",

The food was unlike anything I've had in a crepe. Check out pictures. Where do you get chorizo and eggs in a crepe with homemade salsa?

It seems like everyone in our party (7 adults) were all a little underwhelmed and said their crepes were good, but not great.   My husband and I Ordered 3 so we could try a couple: Sonora (carne asada, guac, salsa, cheese) - good, spicy; Perfect Combination (strawberries, chocolate) - just okay, strawberries were dry and crepe seemed a little underdone; Monkey (bananas, Nutella) - best of the three, really good, but rich and a little heavy on the Nutella (and I LOVE Nutella, so that's saying something).",

However, they do manage to offer something unique for the area. I have had crepes before, but it wasn't at a restaurant that specialized in making crepes. I got two crepes to try out two different flavors; savory and sweet.  Savory Crepe I asked for their suggestion on their savory crepe that had some spice to it. They recommended The Sonora, which is essentially a carne asada taco with guacamole. However, the crepe has an interesting texture, where the pores will absorb all the juices and when you eat the crepe you can taste all the flavor at once. I could taste the salty meat juices and guacamole flavors just in the crepe. Meat was very tender and the meal did come with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  Sweet Crepe I also go their sweet crepe to taste, and I was more impressed with their sweet crepe then their  savory crepe. The Ana banana foster, crepe had carmely sweet sauced drenched on top and with in the crepe that was full of bananas. They gave whipped creme to go on top. The flavors were amazing, if you like bananas then you are going to enjoy a rich buttery/banana flavors that just ooze out of this crepe.  I am definitely coming back for more, the prices are reasonable ($7-9/crepe). Parking can be an issue during their busy hours.",

I heard other people say that they usually have a 45 minute wait.  They make crepe fresh but my carne asada was not as fresh and very dry.  The Sonora sounds good but there was very little cheese  to my taste.  Also the guacamole was good it helped the dryness.  The chicken noodle soup taste like I hate to say liptons chicken noodle soup from coffee vending machine ones when I was in college.   My husband got the la jolly and he enjoyed it.  My son got the sweet Apple one and it looked pretty good.   I use to go to the magic pan and for some reason I remember it to be tastier.  I don't I will be coming back here even with all the reviews and high stars.  My meal was not worth 9.50.",

So you put your name on the list and they'll call you when it's your time and you have to stand in line and order. You can't just walk up and stand in line without putting your name in... it's bad manners! Just kidding. But you do wait until you're called.  They have a large selection of crepes from sweet to savory. The Ana Banana Foster was delicious! I ate everything! The Nutty Classic was kind of too sweet for me, but that was to be expected with the Nutella. The crepe itself was good and they seem to serve the perfect amount of filling.  If I am ever in the area again during breakfast time, I would go back. It's just such a long drive for me.",

The first time I ordered the Caprese with chicken. The chicken was just dry and hard to eat and my husband ended up commenting that the pesto looked like something disgusting. The flavors just didn't do it for me, but I decided to come back a second time for a sweet crepe.   I ordered the Berry Delight asking for whipped cream on the side. I had ordered this to go and they told me it would be ready in 5 minutes. I ended up waiting about 20 minutes to get my crepe. I finally was able to dig into my crepe and I didn't care for crepe itself. The fruit was good, but I was not impressed yet again.  The crepes are definitely big enough to feed one person though.  This place is super cute inside, but I probably won't be rushing back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Crepes and mimosas and beers and sodas and...there is almost too much yumminess packed into this little purple paradise. Yes, crepes both savory and sweet are the main attraction, but it is the little extras that thrilled me.   For crepes, you choose from savory, sweet or breakfast (available all the time) all around $7 a piece, and each one is definitely a meal. The selection makes this the perfect stop for any time of day. I ordered the Monterey which featured bacon, but not because of the bacon. I actually selected it for the serrano pepper. I wanted something with a kick, and I was pleasantly surprised with the nice heat. Every bite was delicious, and it was served with a bowl of juicy, sweet watermelon. Thoughtful touch: they have a video camera installed above the crepe station so you can see your crepe being made from above on a TV screen! It's like a Food Network studio!  But, what I truly adore about this spot are the beverages, including the adult kind. They have at least 6 craft soda pops, a small and tasty beer menu, wines, champagnes and mimosas in five flavors! This really takes brunch to a buzzy level of fun. If you're indecisive, you can get a sampler, but I went with the pomegranate. If I had had a designated driver, I would have had 3 more! Plus, they have big containers of ice lemon and cucumber waters. The perfect touch for the crazy heat!  If you have \"crepe\" expectations, I am pretty sure they'll get met here!",

Huge crepe filled with chicken, ricotta cheese, olives and other stuff. It filled me up.   Definitely have to have their mimosas because some of the flavors are fresh squized juices. My favorite is definitely blood orange mimosa.  Second time I had veggie crepe. It is smaller serving and tasted just ok. Probably wont order that again. Atmosphere is very nice, great decor. They dont have a lot of seating for how busy they can be, but they do have few tables outside. Service is great too, very friendly environment.",

We went for brunch and had DELICIOUS crepes. I had the La Jolla crepe (bacon, lettuce, tomato, guac, and chipotle mayo) and it was UH-Mazing.  I was also stoked that I could order a mimosa! I had one with pineapple juice instead of orange. They serve all different juice blends as well!   Even their water is yummy- infused with lemon and cucumber.  Refreshing!  So the other thing that was great was the service.  They are all so friendly and easygoing.  I'm pretty sure it was one of the owners that waited on us. Nice to see a place that cares about their guests.   Now I MUST go back because I see that they have \"perfected\" their gluten-free batter!  Can't wait!!!",

Lou greets EVERY and when I say EVERY I absolutely mean EVERY person with the biggest brightest smile I've ever seen in my life and the most genuine warmest welcome ever!! I often take my daughter here to have brunch & every time we come in I'm truly amazed at how Lou greets every customer as if they're the first customer to come in & it's his first day opened with his brand new sparkling business! Often if you go to a business and its towards the end of the shift you will get this almost robotic insincere greeting but with Lou that just doesn't exist. You could come in 5 min till close & Lou will greet you as if it's 5 min after open!  I really wish I could give this place infinity stars because that's what they deserve! Each and every staff member is so positive and full of the greatest energy. A happy staff makes for happy customers. I always take the time to observe how the staff treats not only the customers but each other from the owners to the dish washers they are really a team effort & I couldn't be happier with the service they provide me each time I come in.

Crepe Expectation is definitely worth a try if you are sick of Las Vega's crazily large-portioned breakfast buffet. I had the Monterey Crepe - filled with goodness of bacon, egg, red onion, mild serrano pepper and cheese.The serving was generous, the flavor was good, however the crepe was a bit on the soft side (probably because of the melted cheese).  I can see Crepe Expectation being a great hang-out spot after a late night of drinking. The place is a bit on the dark side because of the extremely tinted door and dark-color decors. It does not send out that vibrant and energetic vibes that you would like to have in the early morning.",

About 30 minutes into our visit, the man waiting tables came and told us he had an available table we could use. We were on a time crunch and were only going to be there for a little bit longer so gave it to another couple sitting outside bearing the wind with us. The food and mimosas there were amazing.

I am a big banana fan so I settled on the bananas foster crepe, however they did have a couple of variations to choose from.  Seating is small and we just beat the rush which leads to a line forming in the back of the inside.  Pricing is moderate and on target with what is offered on the strip.  The owner who was playing cashier when I was there was very nice and genuinely friendly.  I don't get out much for breakfast, but this is a place worth visiting if you are in the Henderson area!",

    "text": "\"They're just really thin pancakes.\" No, they're not. This place takes crepes to a whole new level.   Going in first thing to hit me was the decor. Everything works together. If this place wasn't done by a pro interior designer, then the owners have a promising backup career in case the whole crepe thing doesn't pan out (knock on wood!). Everything's black and white with pink/fuchsia (sorry I dunno my colors, I never got those huge crayon sets as a kid). It's super classy and cute. They also have two tvs on the food network, and another smaller one hooked up to a camera above the cooking area so you can watch your crepe being made.   I shared half a Sonora crepe and half a Greek crepe. The crepes themselves were perfectly done, thin and light and almost melt in your mouth. I think I liked the Sonora better, it was super savory and filled with carne asada, smooth guacamole and gooey jack cheese. The Greek was literally a Greek chicken salad in a crepe. It was super fresh from the spinach and tomatoes, with a nice saltiness from the feta. I was stuffed and decided to pass on a sweet dessert crepe today.  For my drink I got a white peach mimosa. The sampler trio is super duper popular, but I've had it enough times to know which flavor is my fave. They also have a ton of fancy sodas that I've never heard of. I'm tempted to try the ginger beer, but the mimosas are just too good to pass up. The mimosa was served in a neat flute glass and was sweet without being too sweet.  It's all the little things, all the attention to detail that shows in the decor/crepes/drinks  that gives this place five stars in my book.",

Maybe they should add a bench or something so people can sit while they wait?   Food was excellent. I had the Turk with soup. The crepe was the size of my plate and stuffed to the brim with fillings. The bald guy at the register, who I later found out was the owner, was very nice and gave us his recommendations on menu options. He came to check on us during our meal, chatted for a little and made sure to thank us for coming by. Great customer service. I also LOVED that they have a self serve cucumber water cooler, DELICIOUS! I will definitely  come here next time I am leaving Vegas",

    "text": "Today I went to the new location (right next door to the old one) which is much larger with a lovely outdoor patio. Unfortunately the food was so bad. My breakfast crepe was a Crepelet and was so dry. The eggs and ham were overcooked. The crepe was too thick. If I hadn't had a side of cottage cheese I could not have eaten it. As it was I left half since it was almost burnt inside.  My husband's crepe, the Rosarita, was only palatable because it had sour creme inside the crepe which made it eatable. His eggs and meat were also overcooked. It seems like they cooked the food up ahead of time and left the ingredients in a warmer for a while until someone ordered. The inside food for the crepes was NOT fresh.   The counter service was fine. But with this larger area it seems that the service could be better and have waitresses instead of a counter. The drink counter for the water and coffee were scrunched up on the side. No room to hardly pass by the table. No trays so it was hard to handle the large cups for refills. Maybe it would be better to have paper cups with lids if you are having a drink counter for the hot coffee.   Others that were with our group had the sweet crepes and said they were great. Anyway, very disappointed since I have not been here for awhile. Now I know not to come again.",

Without any food to enjoy the drink with, I did not drink my Mimosa. I am lowering my rating to two stars this morning. This is NOT the restaurant to socialize at. The restaurant has limited seating so as we drank the last sip of our Mimosas, they urged us to leave so that they would be able seat the next customer. This is not a bad thing as they were able to seat us quickly and probably told the people before us the same thing.  The food is great and the staff are very friendly. We love to eat here.

    "text": "I LOVE this place!  It's a ways off the strip but we happened to be near here and looking for some good breakfast with gluten free options that was open on New Year's Day and this place was!!  I just love that you can get ANY of the crepes on the menu gluten free!!  That is so awesome.  They have salty crepes and sweet crepes!  They were pretty busy this day so we got the first available table which was outside and took 10 minutes, inside was about 20 minutes.  But they had a nice guy who was seating people and directing. The cashier was super nice and I like his general demeanor.  Our party ordered a gluten free breakfast crepe, a gluten free classic crepe (nutella), a caprese crepe, and a fruit sweet crepe.  The crepes come with a side order of your choice.  For gluten free crepes, could choose bananas and something else.  The caprese crepe came with a salad.  You can add whipped cream to the sweet ones.  Everyone liked their crepes!  The only thing to mention would be the sweet crepes are really sweet especially the nutella one which is all nutella then powdered sugar then whipped cream and hazelnuts on top.  BUT that is coming from me who doesn't like really sweet stuff but I can see a lot of people loving how sweet it is. I can't vouch for the non gluten free crepe but my party members said it was really good and it looked good, thin and smooth.  The gluten free crepe tastes like it looks, a bit more on a grainier side and less elasticity then the regular crepe so it breaks apart a little easier but still delicious!  And to have gluten free crepe options is just 5 stars for me!  The breakfast crepe had egg and potatoes and cheese in it.  It was yummy.  I think with the gluten free crepe it was a tad on the dry side, but ketchup fixes that. Nice servers and free parking in the strip mall lot is always a plus!  Thanks for a great New Years breakfast!",

    "text": "I've heard great things about this place so I really wanted to enjoy it when I came here for the first time this afternoon. However, my experience was just okay and nothing beyond that. Walking in, my mother and I looked over the menu to see what interested us. The lady running the register was also helpful and told us some of the great selections they had. We ending up ordering three crepes: the special Lou's BBQ crepe, the Sonora crepe, and the Monkey crepe. I also ended up ordering a Chamomile tea. As we were trying to find a place to sit, the inside can use a little bit of fixing up. But it looked pretty decent. I also noticed a few flies flying around that may not make the place so attractive. We sat down near the area where the water and coffees were. The table was a little wobbly the staff was nice enough to fix it for us. As the worker brought out my tea, I was highly disappointed when I saw a pot of hot water and a tea bag. For $4.35 for tea, I was honestly expecting more. I can buy a box of tea bags at the store for that amount of water and boil some hot water at home. The plate where the cup for the tea was on was also dirty which was really unappetizing to look at. Even if its only for the tea, there should be no excuse for having it on a dirty plate. About 8 or 10 minutes, our crepes came out. As soon as the food came out, I noticed that there was a hair in the salad that came with one of the crepes. I know things like this happened in any restaurant so it wasn't a big issue for me since they were also kind enough to replace it. They looked pretty delicious. I liked the flavor of both the Lou's BBQ crepe and the Sonora. My only complaint was that the meat was a little tough for me and my mom to eat on the Sonora which made us like the Lou's BBQ crepe a little better. After finishing both crepes, they then brought out the Monkey, which was probably the highlight for our meals. I'm a huge fan of sweet crepes so I really did enjoy this one. If you love nutella with bananas and strawberry; I definitely recommend this one.  Overall, service and food was good. They can maybe do something to change the tea or just lower the price for a tea bag and hot water. My experience was decent but I'm not sure if it was good enough for me to come back.",

    "text": "I don't go to Vegas for the rooftop pool parties, the drunken bar crawls, or the free drinks you get while playing penny slots. I go to Vegas to eat at Crepe Expectations. Ok fine, I go for the other stuff too, but seriously, one of the first things that comes to mind when my friends suggest a Vegas trip is crepes.  Here's what you need to do, go with at least one other person and share at least one savory crepe and one sweet crepe. Trust me, you need both. The turmoil and heartache that would result from trying to choose between a savory crepe and a sweet crepe would not be a burden I'd wish upon anyone. It looks like the menu has actually changed quite a bit since I've been there, but based on what I've had in the past I'll recommend the Sonora or the Little Italy for the savory crepe and for the sweet crepe, the Frisco is an absolute must-have.  Fresh, high quality ingredients combined with top notch culinary expertise and a dash of creativity make Crepe Expectations one of the best places to eat in Vegas. Please go here and feel free to thank me afterwards.",

So even with that small of a space, there is room to move along with a good number of seats.  TV's on the wall and a \"Theater TV\" above the cooking station.  Rueben.  This crepe was actually good.  I didn't know what to expect, but this delivered.  The flavor was, well, that of a Rueben.   And filling.    Berry.  The Laadee had this.  I liked it.  She said it could be sweeter but I enjoyed the natural sweetness of the products.  The whipped cream tasted like whipped cream.  All employees were friendly and nice.",

Atmosphere - Purple is the team here.  Outside patio was perfect for this beautiful morning.  The patio is dog friendly so I sat at a spot my wife could watch the bull dog.  The kitchen is open with a large crepe stations.  Three crepe griddles, a wall of bananas, and another three crepe griddles are right there for easy viewing.  One person worked three crepes which is magic right there.  Food   Drink - Self-service black coffee for me, decaf for my wife.   Breakfast - My wife and I ordered two crepes with the plan of splitting them.  A savory one and a sweet one, yep I wanted the sweet one.  My wife selected the Sunday Morning, even though it was Saturday.  This was a hearty filling crepe.  These crepes are not flat, they are stuffed to the gills.  I had the William Tell, this was like having apple tart.  Oh yeah we ordered the crepes gluten free for my wife.  I could not tell they were gluten free.  Service - When we arrived the line was almost to the door.  Thinking this was to get a seat it was a little dishearten but it was to place your order.  The line moved quickly and you are given a number to take with you.   After a bit the food is delivered to you.  Future - I think this would be an easy sale to my wife to get her back here.",

In fact a small pasta side would be a perfect pairing for this dish. But,  alas, not on the menu.  It would be way too much food anyway because the Caprese crepe by itself is an ample meal for almost anyone. The coffee is self-serve so be prepared to take a stroll over to the drink bar. Staff, whether at the order station or bussing tables, are attentive and helpful.   Crepe Expectations isn't for everyone,  but for folks like me who don't mind cruising through the tables to the drink bar,  it might just be that little treasure that is a delight to find!",

He should never be allowed to be anywhere in the food industry or food service whatsoever. Rude, nasty and certainly needs better understanding of sanitary standards. I asked for new silverware cause we used the old ones on savory crepes, and so I went to grab one and I saw they had one wrapped in paper. he stops me from taking those and he grabbed with bare and sweaty hands unwrapped ones and goes \" I'll bring them to you my man\" I ordered savory and sweet and we told cashier guy to hold off for sweet ones till we finish savory and if he can bring me cappuccino with sweet crepes. Server comes in with cappuccino first within minute we set down. I don't know maybe it's cultural thing but we drink coffee with desert so I asked guy if they can bring it later and he said \"sure if you pay for it\"! Fine I guess, I'll give him benefit of a doubt he never worked in food industry or perhaps with humans so maybe that explains but place definitely needs some happy friendly people, with better attitude than what's now there. Food was just okay, prices are very reasonable and place looks very clean and busy. Wish you tons of luck, consider new staff please. After guy started ranting like an angry teen girl in my private mailbox instead like real grown up, or  businessman I attached sample of his feeble attempt to prove point. He mentions I drank cappuccino and I've asked for another one, when in reality I didn't drink it at all, so when foam dissipated looked like it was missing 3/4 of the cup. Louie Louie when will you learn 3/4 of the cappuccino is actually foam lol. Poor guy. Hey you bragging about being 30 years in the industry in your private message to me. You forgot to mention which industry. Cause if it was food, I'm sorry to say but what a wasted three decades. Again, stop ranting and crying cause when people read reviews (and they mainly go for negative ones) they will see that tons of us had problem with your nasty and insolent attitude and crappy service sir. Hey on the good side at least your food is mediocre. And don't step on toe of blogger. That's a big no no. Cheers",

    "text": "I've had crepes in the past which were entirely too eggy for my liking. This has always stopped me from coming into Crepe Expectations. But having seen them on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (recent re-run), I figured I should set aside my pre-conceived notions and give them the benefit of the doubt. I am happy I did.  It was about 10:30 AM when I came in. Too early for me to want a sweet crepe. And I am not a fan of breakfast foods. I had seen the Sonora crepe on TripleD and that sounded good so that is exactly what I ordered. It came with my choice of soup or salad. The soup was sopa de fideo and that beats out a salad. Add an ice tea and I was set.  There is inside and outside seating here. It was kind of noisy inside so I headed out to the patio. This gave me nice atmosphere. It was a little cool and breezy but there were gas tower heaters turned on so it wasn't too bad. I placed my order number plackard on the table and waited a handful of minutes for my food to arrive.  I went in for the small bowl of soup first. A light chicken broth with diced tomatoes and fideo noodles. A pleasing way to open up my taste buds. Then onto the crepe. This large, thin, pancake-esque wrap was stuffed with carne asada, cheese, salsa and guacamole. The asada was tender and citrusy. The salsa had a nice heat to it. Enough to feel the burn but not kill the flavors. The guacamole was creamy and rich. The crepe had a slight eggy essence but not nearly as bad as I half expected. And in all honesty, the combination of flavors from the crepe and its fillings were almost like eating a good breakfast burrito. Not a bad thing at 10:30 in the morning.  Service is amazing here. Super friendly and courteous. The food is good. Portions are alright. A little small for a big eater like me but I would not say that I left hungry. I'm just saying a few more bites would have gone down easy. All in all, this is a cool place with a nice variety of fillings. I don't know that I am a fan of crepes yet but I would not mind trying a couple more options here sometime.",

I have to say , yeah I get it it is Sunday I should expect it to be busy at such a popular place. But I think the restaurant can probably do something to improve the process of ordering , people are spending 6 -7 minutes just at the cashiers.   The restaurant is also very hot, we were sitting in maybe 85 degree room waiting and eating the food, it is quite miserable. Again, I guess also expected when the kitchen is open to the sitting area, and people are standing in line at the door  keeping the door opened and warm air coming in.  Anyway! The whole time while I was waiting I asked myself is the food really that good? even despite the slow service and the horrible sitting environment people are still raving about this place ?! The crepes are great!!! It is worth it, I got the berry delight, it was delicious. The berries are very sour though. The crepe itself was probably one of the best I have had",

The Ana Banana crepes have apparently gone the way of the dodo bird, but my wife and I zeroed in on the description of the Go Bananas Foster crepe that included an entire banana, creme de banana, and brandy sauce with a large dollop of whipped cream on the side.  At a small up charge, we gladly accepted the offer to include fresh strawberries.  These crepes proved to be delicious though stars have been deducted because my wife's crepe was overdone and the bananas in my crepe were brown at the core.  Once again, the owner and staff were friendly so you can expect future reviews from us.",

One of my closest friends initially recommended this establishment for breakfast, but she warned me that great places have a big wait so I needed to pack my patience. Upon our arrival, the line to order was fairly long, but it moved rather quickly. The staff was prompt and friendly which I appreciated, especially during a busy Sunday morning brunch rush. Their prices were reasonable too and the crepe I ordered was truly magnificent. I ordered the Rosarito off the breakfast menu which is a crepe filled with eggs, cheese, chorizo, and guacamole. Sounds tasty right? It was delicious to say the least. I look forward to trying a sweet crepe next time. Looking forward to stopping in again real soon.",

I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally made it over here for a quick dinner last night, So fab. It's a small place that is very nice and modern on the inside. Food Network on the large flatscreen. And a view of the crepes being made on a smaller flatscreen.  They also have a dog friendly patio with water and treat bowls, which is totally awesome.  I opted for a trio of mimosas. There are several to choose from and I went with the white peace, lychee, and pomegranate. The lychee was fantastic! For a crepe, I went with a savory option and had the La Jolla. So yummy! It was like a spicy BLT in a perfectly done crepe. It had crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, and chipotle mayo. And it was a pretty large crepe. And their breakfast crepes are available all day long.  They also have a nice selection of beer, wine, and unique sodas. And the prices are pretty great, especially considering the portions and yumminess.   I will most definitely be back!",

He checked on us throughout our meal even offered a to-go cup for my orange juice. Very good service & food was amazing definitely worth the drive although it seemed a little pricey it would be nice if they offered a yelp check in coupon.

Once we saw Nutella fillings, it was clear to us what we were going to order!  We ordered The Monkey : Nutella, Banana, Chocolate Drizzle, Fresh Whipped Cream and Powdered Sugar. This was great, and they weren't shy with the Nutella! Lots of sugar though...so not super filling IMO. But definitely yummy! This was about $7 including the strawberries added.  Since I was still a little hungry, I decided to drive across the street to Nielsen's Frozen Custard! Keep it in mind for after lunch!",

We came a little bit later on a Sunday afternoon (about 1PM) so we missed the rush and the long wait time.   We were greeted right away. Since it was our first time there, the host gave us lots of recommendations. We tried the Frisco and the lemon curd was tart, tangy and sweet, just like it should be and perfectly paired with blueberries.   We also tried the guava juice which was delicious. We had to wait a bit for our drinks, but everything was definitely worth it! Finally tasted a crepe in the U.S. that was delicious!",

While your still settling up/finishing up they already have the next persons ticket on your table. People are literally standing next to you while you are sitting eating waiting for your table. They really need to expand locations in order to keep neighborhood locals coming. We are sad to say that today's breakfast may be the last time we fight the crowd to eat here.",

Menu is divided into savory, sweet, and breakfast, each item crafted thoughtfully, however I was disappointed to find the fillings poorly proportioned--my crepelet was 95% dry ham cubes, 4% overcooked eggs, and 1% cheese, and our dessert crepe was aggressively saccharine. Barista products were fresh, and the on-site squeezed juice is a special treat. Staff is charming and outside seating comfortable. Will be giving it another go, avoiding the crepelet next time.",

I also tried the 'perfect combination' which was almost perfect if the strawberries were fresh and not too sour! Also tried the 'monterey' which was very good and just a little bit on the spicy side - but made it really good! Also tried the mimosa sampler. I picked the mango, watermelon and passion fruit. I liked the watermelon best and then passion fruit. Mango was alright but tasted off at the end. I will most likely go back next time but will think twice because of the wait time and the limited seating could lead to an awkward seat section. The guy sitting the customers seemed quick but not so attentive. The guy taking the order was nice but too fast for the crepe line. It took about 20 minutes before we got our order and that's not including the wait line. Complimentary cucumber & lemon water was a real treat!",

They make the crepes fresh when you order, right in front of you so you're sure it's hot off the griddle. The Monterey is the perfect breaskfast- bacon, scrambled egges, and cheese nicely tucked away into a moist, thin, yummy crepe blanket. That little bundle of joy was having me singing lullabies into the land of food heaven. Mmm Mmm good- no crumb went to waste, that is for sure! My fiance had The Rosarita- chorizo, scrambled eggs, guac, and cheese. Also a fine dish that tasted very much like a breakfast burrito. A little heavy for my taste, but still a winner. I'll definitely be back to try their other Crepe Creations.",

    "text": "One of the unique things about Crepe Expectations is that you can see your crepe being made.  Their crepe griddles are behind a glass panel offering a perfect view.  And they have a camera mounted above the griddles so you can also see them being made on the TV.  Way cool.  My family and I ordered 4 different crepes.  It took a little while for us to receive them, but it's understandable seeing how crowded it was.  Each one was delicious.  Especially the Capresse crepe.    The employees are so nice and welcoming.  They really make sure everything is taken care of.  A nice touch: you can choose between cucumber water and lemon water.  They had 12 different mimosas.  I wish I ordered one.",

We went next door and he actually came next door to let us know our table was ready. (Don't worry, we'll be back to the dog place) .  We were saved a table and ordered.  The owner takes your order and he has a great personality ! Very down to early and you could tell he loves what he does!!  I ordered a white mocha on ice, and it was so good!  You can watch your crepe being made from an over head camera and TV which was very cool Now for the food ! I ordered the Ana bananas foster crepe. Presentation is great! Food tastes even better .  All in all. I would Definetely come back. Very pleased",

There's seating indoors and out, the inside is gorgeous. You probably wouldn't believe it but the owner Lou decorated it all himself and he has good taste might I say. Upon entering we were greeted by the man himself, he was very pleasant, handed us a menu and wow! There were so many amazing crepe creations, sweet and savory to choose from. We decided to try 2 savory The Sunday Morning and The Monterey. For the sweet The Ana Bananas Foster. Wow! wow! wow! If you have any hesitation about trying this place please don't! The bananas foster is to die for! The food is absolutely amazing and the owner welcomes you and treats you like family. Go for the crepes, stay for the ambience and good conversation!",

We got one savory and one sweet crepe:  Greek: feta, olives, onions, chicken, spinach, plus a small side salad or soup. This one's a bit messier to eat because nothing will stay intact.   Avalon: pears, goat cheese, honey, walnuts, side of whipped cream. This one is definitely a dessert crepe and it's pretty sweet.   Both crepes were really big and had generous fillings. I'd highly recommend the avalon if you like the goat cheese combo; otherwise it has a very distinct flavor that some people aren't too fond of.",

    "text": "Before I begin my review, I would first like to state the most negative part of Crepe Expectations:   The fact I live in Orange County, CA and this place is all the way in Henderson, NV.  That is a real bummer to me now that I have tried this place out.  My wife and a couple of friends visited Lake Mead over the weekend and didn't want to suffer the consequences of 10 bathroom breaks on the way home by eating the hotel's breakfast buffet.  So what did I do?  I fired up Siri on my iPhone and asked it where I can eat something good for breakfast as we strolled through Henderson.  Crepe Expectations topped the recommended food restaurants with its massive amounts of positive reviews so we said screw it, lets try this place out.  Upon driving up, the store looks pretty timid and small - but was quite busy and thriving on the patio so it was pretty inviting.  When you walk through the door it reminds you of a very classy bar type of atmosphere with most of the tables packed with couples and families, and overall just a great atmosphere.  When walking up to the counter the owner, Lou, was smiling ear to ear.  This guy was one of the most enthusiastic business owners I have ever met, you could tell he cares about his customers and has a lot of passion for what he does.  He took the time to explain various items on the menu in great detail, and was very well-spoken and articulated every detail of the dish he was explaining.  It was just so refreshing to see someone that stoked about what they do and how they run their business- you don't see that too often around my neck of the woods unfortunately.   Anyway, my wife and I ordered the Sunday Morning plates and my friends ordered some other Crepe's that I do not recall.  We also ordered some Mimosa's which they had a huge menu of various flavors.  Then the food came out - granted I have never even had a Crepe in my life... AMAZING.  The food was so tasty I can't even describe it.  My dish I had them add Serrano peppers and diced ham - I couldn't believe how great it tasted.  We requested some hot sauce and Lou recommended their house salsa.. best idea ever.  The salsa was so awesome, it was better than most authentic Mexican restaurants salsa!    The food was perfect, the service was prompt and courteous, and the owner himself is there to make sure everything comes out well and to your liking.  I felt like I was in his own dining room and a guest of Lou & his wife's house and left wanting to come back again, but unfortunately that won't be able to happen until our next Lake Mead trip.. next year :(",

    "text": "I debated writing a review because I didn't want to give three stars (even if there's nothing wrong with \"A-OK\") to a place where a) the people are incredibly friendly, b) the soda selection is delightful, and c) the concept is cool.  But, since I'm never going back again, I guess I need not take the path of the sheepish.  Like I said, great people in the store. The customers seemed nice, too. (Although the people at the table right next to the crepe station were annoyed that I had to keep standing near them to read the menu. Not a great spot for a table.) A group of people stopped us before we went inside and raved - raved! - about how we had to try the pulled pork (I think it was) crepe. So, I get that this place has big fans, and I may just be the oddball. (My loss.)  A variety of neat bottled sodas stands ready in the big fridge, and if you aren't a member of the Secret Ginger Beer Club who already knows where to get The Very Best Ginger Beer in Town, good news: they sell it here. Ask for a stumpy brown bottle of brewed Bundaberg ginger beer and prepare to walk among the initiated.   (But, once you're hooked, I recommend buying it when it's on sale at Cost Plus World Market - as far as I know, the only other place here that sells it.)  I love that there's a selection of both sweet and savoury crepes served with your choice of soup and side salad at a reasonable price. I also think it's clever how a camera points down at the preparation area, so you can watch your crepes being prepared. Neat-o.  Where everything falls apart for me, though, is the taste.  My husband and I both ordered savoury crepes. I got the caprese, one of the two vegetarian options. (The other has hummus, which I wasn't ready to try in a crepe yet. I really wanted something kind of traditional with cheese and was disappointed that the caprese with mozzarella, a slow melter, was my only vegetarian option.)   I've eaten quite a few crepes, both sweet and savoury, since the first French Club field trip back in junior high. I've never eaten them in Paris, granted, but in 30+ years of crepe-eating around the country, I always experienced two constants until visiting Crepe Expectations:  1. The crepe itself tasted like something nice in its own right.  2. The finished crepe was not indistinguishable from a wrap sandwich.  Looking at reviews here, and judging by the other customers when I was in CE, I guess mine is the minority opinion. (My husband is also in this minority - I suppose we're lucky we found each other.) I'm happy for the rest of you that you can find joy in crepes three inches high.   (Okay, looking at photos here I can see that some people have had more sensibly sized crepes, but ours were huge. I felt like it was 1998 and I was getting a two-handed wrap at the Sonic Drive-Thru.)  But even if my crepe had been assembled with a finer touch, not only was the crepe itself completely tasteless and acting only as a wrapper, but the flavors inside were only \"A-OK.\" I couldn't even smell the basil inside my caprese (although that could be because the pesto overwhelmed everything else).  I applaud the idea of Crepe Expectations, and they're probably a great option from the usual if you're working in the area and want something different for lunch, but the next time I'm specifically hungry for melty, herby, toasty, savoury crepes, I'll head for the Strip instead.",

    "text": "I've had a good track record with Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives experiences. This place hasn't ruined it.  I've passed by Crepe Expectations quite a bit in the years that I've lived in this town. I finally decided that I should try it after seeing Guy Fieri taste some crepes on his show otherwise known as Triple D, which would make it my my second official show-inspired visit (most of the others having come before Guy visited/bantered/tasted/filmed). When my friend suggested that we stop by after we picked him up from the airport, I was pretty excited.  It was just before 11am on a Sunday, so it was packed. People were already sitting outside, and all of those tables were occupied by the time we left. We waited awkwardly for not more than ten minutes in the seats lining the hallway to the restrooms before the host waved us over to place our orders at the register. Bearded dude from the show was manning the register, but he ended up talking about my hoodie before I could get in a word about the TV segment. That's alright though - it's not super fresh in memory.  However, what was fresh was The Sonora ($9.50), which I'm pretty sure was also featured on the show. It's also popular with my Yelp friends, so I had to try it. The filling was indeed excellent, with a symphony of delicious carne asada, tomato salsa, guacamole, and jack cheese. The greens on the side are dressed to the point of almost being overwhelmingly acidic, but it completes the ubiquitous carne asada flavor if you portion it correctly. I would've liked for them to just throw in in the crepe. Perhaps they'll humor me if I request that next time.  I also tried a couple bites of my friend's The Monterey ($7.85), with bacon, scrambled eggs, red onion, serrano, and jack cheese. It's just breakfast in a crepe, and it's very balanced, not salty as you might fear, and barely any heat if it was indeed at all spicy. I did find it odd that a bowl of thinly sliced banana was served with this crepe though. It doesn't match the flavor profile at all, so I suppose it's just a nice complimentary dessert. Odd though.  Finally, we agreed on sharing an interesting sweet crepe, The Avalon ($7.75). It's a not-too-sweet affair chock-full of sauteed buttered pear, which the goat cheese and honey played really off of. The whipped cream was great and really enriched the crepe. I liked the candied walnuts too, but they were fairly sparse and didn't provide enough crunch overall to balance out the soft slices of pear. That texture became a drag after a few bites.  Aside from that, what really stopped me from going for the full five stars was the crepes. The crepe texture just dies next to all the wet ingredients, and two of the three crepes were torn when served. I'm sure it's not an uncommon occurrence with crepes, but it means that these crepes don't do much except serve as a relatively low-carb vehicle for the ingredients. I came in with expectations that the crepes would be a highlight, but they aren't.  That said, I will definitely return to Crepe Expectations to try their other menu items. I like what they're doing with their flavors, and the portions are affordable if a bit modest compared to typical breakfast/lunch fare.",

In order of sweetness Frisco - that lemon mixed with blueberry was  a-maz-balls! Avalon- nothing like melted goat cheese with pears, candy walnut and drizzled with honey -mercy! Anna banana - we added fresh strawberries and man alive party in the mouth.   They were all SOOOO GOOD!  Savory in order  Sunday morning. Loved the egg potatoes mix Veggie patch - we added turkey and it tasted like an awesome stir fry Caprese- the pesto was super good!  The owners were as sweet as you can image!  Bonus....the hand scrub in the ladies bathroom. What the heck they sell it at the front desk! Boom!! Bought 2 jars of it. Could not believe how soft it made our hands!",

We were pretty hungry when we got their and in the mood for something unique.  We were quickly greeted by his super nice gentlemen and given a menu.  With so any choices we sat down to decide what we were going to have.    I got the Rosarito which was delicious.  The chorizo was not greasy and was plentiful and delicious. Add it the guacamole, scrambled eggs and jack cheese and this was not only a tasty treat but quite filling also.  The daughter got the Turk which I got to try and it was also awesome.  We took home the Ana Bananas Foster for ,y ate sleeping wife and I treid it also. It was so delicious.    I decided to try the flight of Mimosas selecting the Blood Orange, Mango and Pomegranate.  The came in tall champagne glasses and were very good sized.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good they are.  What a great way to start a day!  I can't wait to try the other flavors on my next visit.    The inside is on the small side and moving around to your table can be a little tricky.  The tables and seating are very comfortable with booth type on one side and chairs on the other side.  The service was outstanding!  The gentlemen who was our server - a retired NY policeman was amazing.  They were pretty busy but he had everything under control.  This is one of Vegas's True Gems!  I can't wait to go back and take friends to experience Crepe Expectations!",

The crepes itself was tasty and the fillings (the ones I tried anyway) were delicious on itself too.   I will say it was deceiving at first when they give you your food, because the food was not plated with any garnish or any contrast of color. So eating with your eyes the plate was very monotone. Not a bad thing, but just so use to places that garnish the hell out of the dish just to make it look appetizing. Here it's simply plated and they let the food speak for itself.  The place gets crowded fast so try to come really early or maybe come after 12 when the breakfast/brunch crowd is gone.",

The chefs are all business and their passion comes through in the finished products.  The gentleman that serves the orders is always quick, efficient and makes sure you're taken care of. If you're in Vegas, make the quick drive out to see them. One of our favorite breakfast spots when we're in town.

    "text": "This is our 4th visit to Crepe Expectations, and as usual the food is exceptionally good and the menu is unique and fun. The flavored mimosas are fun and refreshing and the hot chocolate is delicious! So why only 2 stars? While the food is exceptional, the service and experience consistently fail to live up to the same standards. Every visit the same host/waiter seats us and is pushy, doesn't really make eye contact or connect and seems to have a different way of operating the flow of incoming customers, ordering customers and seating customers so you don't know what to expect, he doesn't explain it and he clearly loses his patience when you can't read his mind.  On past visits, we have walked in submitted our name and then ordered food prior to having a table. This resulted in our food getting to us shortly after we were seated. Today, our female friend gave him her name \"Kim\" and he repeatedly called her \"Tim\" even after multiple corrections, not a big deal just odd. Then we went to get in line to order and he rushed over with paper menus and told us we could wait over in the corner. Having been here before, we assumed he meant after we ordered and before we were seated. Evidentially, we were wrong. He rushed back over and insisted we move to the corner as we were in the way. Not politely.  We went and sat down, through somewhat offended by his tone and clear lack of patience. Once our table was ready, he allowed us to order. This meant we waited at least twice as long as normal for our food to come out.   Once the food arrived, it was so good it almost made up for the poor treatment.   Then, we completed our meal and our plates were removed. One of us was finishing a drink and he other had run to the restroom, when he appeared again in the same rude, rushed, impatient manner and insisted we leave so he could turn over the table. After tipping 20% on the $25 ticket for 2, I was not impressed in the least.  The food is good, but not good enough to deal with the host/waiter. You need someone with better communication and customer service skills to deal with customers. Just kidding",

Easy process and special orders are accommodated. For those that desire or require a Gluten Free Crepe, they make those too.   My wife and I split 2 crepes: - Monterey (a savory breakfast crepe) - Avalon (a sweet, pear crepe)  Both crepes were very good. I especially enjoyed the heat (Seranno) of the Monterey.   We'd love to back to Crepe Expectations.",

We wanted to try them all but settled on four savory and two sweets.  Both sweets are very good and a can't miss!  We ordered the Monkey (Nutella, banana, & chocolate) and the Perfect Combination (strawberry & chocolate).  The four savory are a hit and miss.  Out of the four, the Chicken w/green Chilli (Salsa Verde) was the best and will definitely order  again.  Try this place out when you are visiting Las Vegas and indulge yourself with one of the best sweet crepes in town!!",

Since they have moved down a shop they have a much larger seating area and also have plenty of covered outdoor seating. Some very cool origami made from tips at the register. Very creative people showing appreciation.  This visit we enjoyed the Marco Polo, ground sausage with eggs and jack cheese with a side of fresh sliced bananas and The Perfect Combination topped with strawberries, powdered sugar and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Both dishes were delicious and crepes were prepared perfectly. There might have been a Mimosa sampler had as well ;-). The White Peach, Raspberry and Guava are always great choices! If you want to try other flavors they include: Pineapple, Mango, Strawberry, Passion Fruit, Blood Orange, Watermelon, Pomegranate, Cherry, Orange and Tangerine.

Crepe Expectations is a creperie with all kinds of choices! Each entree is delicately folded into a crepe and served with a side of your choice.  If you have the chance to meet Louis R. at your register don't hesitate to ask him for a recommendation! I would definitely have an idea of what you like or what you're expecting when asking. (Sweet/Savory/Fruit/Eggs/Meat)  Today we did breakfast and dessert! I had the SONORA- Carne Asada Steak, Roasted Tomato Salsa, Guacamole, Jack Cheese ($9.50) and added in two eggs! My breakfast was accompanied by a flight of mimosas! (Peach, Pomegranate, Raspberry)  My companion for this mornings adventure had the SUNDAY MORNING- Seasoned Potatoes, Scrambled Eggs, Jack Cheese ($7.50)and added Chorizo. Also a mimosa flight! (Mango, BlackBerry, Strawberry)   After we finished our breakfast we moved onto dessert and shared The William Tell! - Sauted Cinnamon Apples, Carmel (Yummy!!!)  Make a pitstop to the bathroom if you want to see the poster signed by Guy Fieri!",

Open for breakfast and lunch they have a variety of sweet and savory crepes.   We arrived right at 9:00 am when they opened. Being our first time we ordered on sweet (the monkey) and one savory (Rosarito) crepe. They have a huge selection of mimosas and fresh juices. I had to work later so had a guava juice which you rarely see on a menu.   The crepes arrived a short time later and both were hot and delicious. The monkey was filled with fresh bananas and nutella all melted together. It was topped with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. The Rosarito was full of chorizo, scrambled eggs and cheese. The menu said it had guac but there was little to be found. Both crepes were light and cooked perfectly.   As we were leaving we ran in to the owner, Lou. He asked us how we enjoyed our crepes and was genuinely happy to have us as new customers. Lou explained to us how everything from the chorizo to the whipped cream is all made in house fresh. He seems like a great guy who cares about his customers experiences and the food he puts out.   I will definitely be returning to try some of the savory lunch crepes!",

Amazing flavor. Order with a good amount of meat and filling, very soft crepe. Also came with a side salad . Pictured with my order with a couple flights of mimosas . Perfect Vegas brunch  !",

My favorite is \"the Monterey\"with scrambled egg, bacon, onion it is so delicious. The \"berry delight\" is another crape I would recommend and its from the sweet menu. This restaurant is located close to 215/eastern to be specific its on the corner of eastern and Silverado ranch. To sum up it's a great place for breakfast or brunch. My favorite spot in the morning to start your day. Before I forget Mimosa trio sampler is must also to give you that extra kick",

    "text": "Why have I waited so long to try Crepe Expectations!? It exceeded my expectations for sure.  Last week Thursday, I left for lunch at my usual 11 am to beat the lunch crowd.  I missed Monta Chaya so much, but forgot they don't open until 11:30 when I walked into the unlocked restaurant.  Why can't they just seat me?  When I walked out, they locked the door...how rude!? :D  In any case, Crepe Expectations to the rescue since it was next door. There was a lot to choose from, so I decided on the Greek Crepe.  And since I didn't know how big the crepe was, I also thought I'd get the Del Mar.  When it was my turn to order, I asked how big was the crepe and the nice man pointed to the crepe on the griddle and said it would be folded in half.  So I ordered only the Greek Crepe with the noodle soup.  Great deal at $8.00.  It was a beautiful day, so I chose to sit on the patio. You can smell the incense from the patio dining from Thai restaurant next door.  When my order arrived, which wasn't much long after, I was surprised to see how big the crepe was, it really was and so tasty.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the olives, too salty for me. I thought the soup was ok.  Lot's of noodles but noodles reminded me of the chicken noodle soup where you add hot water, very short and very thin.  5-stars for Crepe Expectations, for great service, great food, great price, and  great atmosphere. I look forward to trying everything else on the menu.",

We couldn't imagine what would make a crepe place in a strip mall such a popular place, so we had to check it out. We were pleasantly surprised. It's a small place, but the food and service were great. We tried The Grand Turk, The Perfect Combination and The Frisco. All were exceptional. The server was friendly and very attentive. He told us how nearly everything is homemade and fresh. It makes a difference as we really enjoyed the meal and were glad we came. Next time we stay in Vegas, we'll make a breakfast stop here. Can't wait to try some of the other crepes.",

I sampled the mimosa trio (10 dollars) and even that was lovely and refreshing. all the flavors were wonderful and something i would go back for. so far I have had the caprese and had to stop myself from going into a food coma. the tomatoes tasted extra fresh and the amount of pesto was perfect so it didn't take away the flavor or the tomatoes or the fresh mozzarella. it also came with a side of watermelon. yums! the rosarito was another one i had tried and holy goodness. chorizo and guacamole and scrambled eggs and cheese! be still my little foodie heart. both were under 8 dollars and again something i would make a special trip for. the service is delightful and you can even watch them make your crepes. they have seating inside and out. also very dog friendly with baskets of treats and buckets of water for those little tail waggers. i'm addicted!",

    "text": "Finally! A great locally owned breakfast/lunch eatery that I'm excited about. Walking in, the first thing I noticed was the beautiful decor: dimly lit, modern wall hangings and a sophisticated, yet cozy atmosphere. What I really liked was that though it was sunny and hot outside, the windows are tinted, so the annoying and shiny sun was nowhere to be found. There are only a few tables inside, but there's covered seating outside. The menu is simple: crepes. Sweet and savory, they cater to all. My girlfriend got the bananas foster crepe and I got...well, I forget what it's called but it had chorizo, guacamole and scrambled eggs...absolutely divine. Served with a side of super sweet watermelon, the crepe itself was tender and unctuous. They're made fresh right in front of you. It's like eating a fresh flour tortilla but richer and eggier (not sure if that makes sense). Anyhoo, They have two different types of free water: lemon and cucumber. I got the cucumber, which was refreshing and a nice change of pace from the standard. We also met the owner who was out and about bussing tables and talking with guests...We could tell he was excited about his job. They also accommodate the GLUTEN FREE! That's right, a gluten free crepe! A very unique and delicious treat, check it out!",

    "text": "This is one of my current favorite places in Vegas for breakfast/brunch/lunch. Everyone who works here is so sweet, attentive, and enthusiastic about helping customers. It's clear that every detail is addressed, from the way the owner talks with customers about where they'd prefer to sit (and then chats about their favorite items!), to the little bowl of sea salt hand scrub in the bathroom, to the cucumber- and lemon-flavored water. The crepes themselves remind me of the ones in France- very light, fluffy, slightly crispy at the edges, buttery, absolute perfection. I usually order the Caprese (tomato, mozzarella (the good kind), homemade pesto, and you can add chicken which I do), and then share a sweet crepe, like the Nutella with bananas and hazelnuts. The whipped cream must be homemade because it tastes incredibly fresh, light and fluffy, and isn't overly sweet or artificial-tasting. The iced tea sometimes takes a few extra minutes to come out, but it is worth it for a delicious cup of fresh-brewed tea poured over ice! The service isn't SUPER fast as this isn't a huge chain, everything is made fresh when you order it, and it is definitely a popular place, but it is prompt, efficient, and always friendly. And personally I'm not one to rush through brunch, so waiting 15 minutes for a fresh, delicious crepe doesn't bother me at all. A definite must for brunch in Vegas!",

    "text": "After looking for  breakfast cafes on Yelp we came upon Crepe Expectations.....I took in some of the negativity as well as the glowing reviews and decided to give it a go.  It was Saturday and it was crowded. On entering the cafe we were drawn to the counter by the owner who said \"Come on in!\"  I must admit first timers suffer a bit of confusion on seating, ordering and being relegated to a narrow hall to wait for your name to be called. We had some trepidation on how long this process was going to take but it was perhaps 15-20 minutes and we were called. By then we had ample time to look over the menus given us on arrival and were seated at a decent sized table. The crepes were exceptional and they didn't take that long to arrive. We ordered the Rosarito and the William Tell along with the Mimosa sampler. We shared them and couldn't decide which we liked more although one was spicy and one sweet.  I've gotta say this is a hard place to bring little kids.  It's crowded, some of the seats are high and it's just too loud to be a family type dining experience.  The cafe is small and the noise level is a distraction but you get used to it.  We were so amazed at how good the food was we were planning our return before we left.  Prepare yourself to be patient and wait if coming on the weekend but it's worth it.  BRAVO! they do crepes.....and only crepes right.",

(Loved being able to watch it being made on the television screen).  We stopped by for lunch and it was very popular.  Fun decor - dark purple and glitzy lights.  They served fresh cantalope on the side.  The staff was very careful how they were preparing the food (wore gloves) and were very friendly.

    "text": "THIS PLACE IS UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME! Came here for brunch on a Sunday between 12-1. I was not expecting an \"order at the counter and then we'll bring it to you\" style, but that wasn't much of a problem.  There is an employee who kind of patrols the ordering line, asking people how many are in their party and then getting them a table. They don't take your order until you have a table to sit at.  Here lies the problem. There is ONE THING I do not like about this place: it isn't big enough. So, when it's crowded, it can be a bit stressful and an awkward wait because of how small the dining area is. We were initially seated at a small table right in the middle of the ordering line, and I didn't like it at all. I do not like it when people are standing over me while I'm eating or trying to enjoy a nice conversation/drinks/good company. But, when I asked if we could have another table, the employee happily said \"No problem, it will just be a few minutes.\" So, we got a taller bar-stool table on the side.   When our table was ready, we ordered. The man taking orders seemed to be either the owner of the head honcho of sorts. He was very friendly and happy to make recommendations. I ordered the Rosarito (chorizo, guacamole, jack cheese, eggs) and my girlfriend ordered the Perfect Combination (strawberries, chocolate, whipped cream, powdered sugar).   I also ordered the Mimosa trio sampler. First of all, they have a chalkboard full of various mimosa flavors (mango, blood orange, orange, passion fruit, white peach, strawberry, raspberry, etc.) and you could pick THREE of them for $10. And these \"sampler\" size cups were not small. I thought they were the same size as any mimosa I'd order at any other brunch place. I chose blood orange, raspberry and passion fruit. The passion fruit and blood orange were my favorite!  The food took a bit to come out, which is slightly surprising because it's CREPES, but I didn't mind the wait because the decor is wonderful and I had amazing company and drinks to keep me busy.   Once our food came, I was surprised at how huge they were. I couldn't finish mine, but wow it was delicious! I have never had a better crepe in my life. My girlfriend loved hers and she also said it was the best she had ever had. The crepes aren't too thin but aren't too thick or overwhelmingly sweet. I couldn't get over how delicious and perfect everything was cooked.   So, EVEN THOUGH I think they were a bit unorganized (they need more space or a better organization of tables inside) and slightly slow with service, I CANNOT give less than 5 stars because of how delicious the food and drinks were (and cheap! $7-8 for a LARGE crepe!). Also, the staff was friendly and attentive.   Check this place out, its CREPETASTIC.",

    "text": "I so badly wanted to LOVE this place. I love the set up, I love the open kitchen concept, and I love crepes! Fairly cheap here, too. I came with my mother in law and my son on a Wednesday morning and it wasn't too busy - as soon as we left though it seems like it started to pick up drastically. I ordered the Marco Polo which is eggs, sausage, and pepper jack cheese(? I could be wrong on the cheese). I was not a fan of the sausage at all, just didn't taste how I was expecting it to. Also, the ratio of all the fillings was completely off making every bite a tad bit disappointing. I want to come back to this establishment and try a different crepe, maybe one of the dessert ones so that I can change my rating but for now I'm going to keep it at 3 stars. Service was amazing though! This man who was behind the cash register was so extremely nice and always checked up on us. I will back, I just won't be ordering the Marco Polo.",

Shared the big table with two other groups. I ordered the apple filing one and a sampler of mimosas. Cherry, mango, and passion fruit. All three were good. My husband had the perfect combination. He enjoyed my crepe better. He also tried a trio - blood orange, strawberry and white peach. My favorite of his was the white peach followed by blood orange. Was fun to watch the making of the crepes on the overhead camera viewing on the TV above the workstation. We will visit again when we are in Las Vegas area.",

Waited about 10 mins to get our order, didn't even notice the wait since we were enjoying our beer and fresh squeezed orange juice. We got 2 crepes- classic and savory. You can never go wrong with bananas, chocolate, & whipped cream. The breakfast crepe was good- ham, cheese, & eggs with a side of cottage cheese. It was good, but nothing amazing. Think once you've had crepes in Hampstead Heath (London), it's hard to find a comparable one in the states. But it was good just not 5 stars for me.",

The crepe was cooked well, some places can be a little doughy. The service was great for me, a server saw me coming in afar in the parking lot with my baby - and right away he found a table for me and my friend. It's a small place, but there are places to sit outside as well. The ambience was busy, you order at the counter, and they bring it to your table. I can see this place being jam packed, but I feel we came at the right time on Super Bowl Sunday. Lol I will definitely come again, and next time try the mimosas sampler trio. ;-P",

    "text": "The reviews on this place are so great I guess I was expecting something much better. The food was just ok. The crepes were light and nice but the filling was a bit skimpy. I had the breakfast Crepelet and there wasn't much egg or cheese. Just a lot of salty ham. My friend had the William Tell with apples, caramel and whipped cream. The apples were hard and the caramel flavorless. Besides the food being just ok, the host was so rude I would never go back.  We walked in and he asked how many and sat us at a table. We were waiting on a third friend and had told him there were 3 of us. We hadn't been there more than 3-4 minutes when he told us if we didn't order right away we would have to give up our table!! I'm not sure why he sat us since he knew our friend wasn't there yet if that's how they operate. We were told there were people waiting. (I'm still not sure why their money is better than mine) However, there were 2 open tables. We did as we were told and quickly ordered and left our friend to fend for herself. She came before we finished ordering and added her order. I've never felt so poorly treated in my life. I felt they were doing me a favor by serving me a meal I was paying for. This is a strip mall, not NYC. It's a restaurant. for dining. This would be a place to visit on the way to the airport or when you are in a rush, not a place you would like to enjoy your meal and have a conversation with friends. I felt like at anytime my plate was going to be taken from me-Lucille Ball style-and I was going to be sent out the door! (Times up, get out!) I guess we didn't understand the \"rules\". The tables are so close together that the older couple next to us was constantly eaves dropping and commenting to us on our conversation. Also rude. I'm glad others have enjoyed this place, but I will not be going back.",

    "text": "I had never heard of this place until a week ago when my friend said she had heard great things and we should go.  The very next day, a Saturday, we decided to meet here at noon. I sort of panicked when I arrived because there were so many people obviously waiting to be seated.  I went in to find the host, but before I could get very far in, he found ME and asked how many.  Turns out he is the owner.  I put my name down, and 30 minutes later we had a seat outside.  The outside is basically a tented area on the sidewalk right out front of the restaurant. The heat wasn't too bad until it got later in the afternoon, I started to feel it (or maybe it was the mimosas??).  The inside is very small and packed. You have to order at the counter and then take a number to your table where they will bring you your food and drinks (if you ordered any).  If you want water though, you have to go get it yourself.    It's a bit of a hassle ordering and getting water. There is a lot of jostling, and squeezing past people and tables and servers and bussers to order your food or to get water.  I wish they would at least serve you water at the table so you didn't have to get up in the middle of your meal to refill your tiny plastic water cup. Also, after we ordered and sat down, it took about 30 minutes for them to bring our food.   However, the food is so amazing that I'm willing to forgive all of that. I ordered the Sonora crepe, which is carne asada, guacamole, fire roasted salsa and cheese. Everything about this crepe was perfection. The flavors worked so incredibly well together. I could not stop eating even after I was stuffed.  I can't wait to go back and eat it again!    They also offer mimosa samplers. For $10 you get 3 flavors - my favorite was the strawberry and the guava. Yum!   I now have new-found love for crepes!",

    "text": "I was excited to come to Crepe Expectations after dropping my dog off for a grooming next door. It's a small restaurant on Eastern with a purple vibe.  Inside, it was a little cramped, which is why it's hard to get a reservation. However, there happened to be a table opened, so we got there by a good chance.  To order, the customer must go up to the cashier like at a traditional cafe, and then the employee gives you a number and then you sit down. The wait for us was decent, not long, but not short either. (About 15 minutes)  The crepes itself are worth the wait, though. They're huge and can easily be taken to go as well. They offer many options, savory, sweet, and breakfast. I usually have my crepes with their jasmine tea and honey. It's such a refreshing treat to have any time of the day!  I do recommend Crepe Expectations for anyone who wants to relax and chill with friends. However, it is quite cramped, so it wouldn't be suitable for going on a date. Make sure to wear comfortable clothes as well! It makes the experience a lot better.",

    "text": "My experience with crepes has always been of the homemade variety - en masse. I used to make and sell crepes stuffed with Nutella or jam to fund raise for the high school French Club that I was apart of. That said, I had my \"commercial crepe\" cherry (?) popped at Lisa L's bachelorette brunch UYE today (7/23/11.)  I was 12 minutes late because I had the fantastic idea to just walk the almost 3 miles to the restaurant, so everybody had already ordered by the time I got there. I ordered a bottle of Pelligrino ($3,) because it was hot on that walk, and the La Jolla crepe with a side of watermelon ($7.) I admit, I had looked over their menu the night before online, so I already knew what I was going to order. I wanted to go with something I couldn't/wouldn't usually make at home myself, so the chipotle mayo is what sold me.   There was a line formed at the register and it took more than 20 minutes for my crepe to come to the table after I ordered, so everybody had already finished eating by the time I got my crepe. Oh well, we had bachelorette Ad-libs to do and MIL stories to trade while I ate and everyone drank their mimosas.   After taking my first bite, I can say that the taste exceeded my crepe expectations! It was pretty good, and was like a better version of a burrito (aka, not a thick wrapper or full of beans or rice!) The watermelon was sweet and juicy, not under ripe like most restaurant watermelon.   Overall, I had a great afternoon with 3 other southern yelpettes (Misti Y, Blair B, Lisa L) and one soon-to-be yelpette. I will return!  An aside: Looking at the Web site, the menu is difficult to find in the jumble of information posted all over the page. As well, the \"justification\" for catering prices is off-putting and is unnecessary. Streamlining the Web site, faster turn around for making/delivering a crepe, and making sure utensils are delivered with the crepe would bump this up to 4 stars - fan worthy food!",

I was very excited to try Crepe Expectations while I was in Las Vegas.  My big mistake was ordering breakfast crepes. They sounded better then they really were. The were not awful, they were just nothing special. Ordinary taste.    I would bet the dessert crepes have to taste better.  Though I doubt I would drive out to  Crepe Expectations the next time I am in Las Vegas.  Bottom line- dissapointed",

    "text": "I've been here twice, had the crepes thrice, all times the food and service were excellent!   They've only been open a couple weeks, but my boss talks about it all the time...so I had to see for myself. The first time I went in, the owners were the ones that greeted me. Friendly, smiling, and welcoming. That's definitely a plus with me. :)   I told them it was my first time, and they asked me a few questions before offering suggestions on what to try. I was super hungry so I wanted a filling-dinner type of crepe. He suggested The Bomber, w/ pepperoni added. He said you can add whatever you want to the crepe. Awesome. The Bomber has meatball, mozzarella, tomato sauce...and I added pepperoni to it.   The Bomber was definitely.... da bomb! (haha lame joke. ;) )   The crepe is a good size and it comes with a side of fruit.   My first time there I chatted with the owners and (I didn't ask for it, but they did it anyways) --- they gave me a sit down type of service. Which I appreciated a lot! Maybe I seemed confused my first time there. But the way it's set up, you order at the counter, they give you a number and they bring your food to you. Even with that type of service, the owners check up on you to see if you need anything and if your enjoying your meal. I love that! That's what top notch customer service is about! :)   My 2nd crepe, my awesome bosses ordered us some from here. I had the Sonora. It includes: carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, jack cheese. It also came with a side of fruit, pineapple. The fruit is different each time. :) Which I enjoy. That was delish as well.   My 3rd crepe, 2nd time here: I brought my friends along with me. It was nice too see the owners remembered me. :) I ordered the Caprese crepe and Mimosa trio sampler. You can choose 3 out of the 5 flavors available. I chose the lychee, passion fruit, and pomegranate. My FAVE was the lychee mimosa!!! I love lychee.... and I was excited to try that one. It was delicious! I wasn't a fan of the other flavored mimosa, but the lychee was my fave.   The Caprese was good. Melted mozzarella, tomato and basil. I loved the drizzle of pesto sauce over the crepe.   I forgot what my friends ordered, but they enjoyed theirs as well.   By the time we scraped our plates clean, we were soooo full but still managed to order a dessert crepe or rather a \"Sweet Yum.\" We couldn't leave here without having one of those. So the three of us shared one. Got the Nutty Classic and added banana and strawberries! It was huge, and delicious! Nutty Classic includes nutella, fresh chopped hazelnuts, whipped cream, powdered sugar...and along with that we added the banana and strawberries! It was heaven!   I'll have to try their other dessert crepes the next time I come in.   We all couldn't stop talking about the decor of the place. It's not what you would expect from the outside. Lots of purple, it's hip yet elegant. If you go, you have to check out the bathroom! the decor in there is beautiful as well!   The prices are not bad, and they have a selection of beer, wine, coffee, waters, juice, etc. Oh they also have two tvs one with the making of your crepe, and one for entertainment.   If your looking for delicious crepes, excellent customer service, beautiful decor, this is the spot!",

The restaurant is located on the back wall of a strip mall right behind Twin Peaks and BJs restaurants, so it is a bit hard to find unless you know where to look. The first time we went for lunch, we were greeted by Louis, the owner - a big man with a big beard and a bigger winning smile.  You order at the counter and they bring your crepe to your table as soon as it is ready (pretty quickly). My wife and I shared a veggie crepe. It came with either a salad or a small bowl of soup. The soup was a chicken broth base with some noodles. Good, but nothing special. The veggie crepe was very tasty, loaded with vegetables and very filling. Today, I sat outside on the patio. It is removed enough from the parking lot that it has a nice feel to it (I was the only one outside today, so it was especially nice for a quiet meal and some reading - yes, they have free WiFi). I had  the Grand Turk, a turkey crepe loaded with chunks of turkey and guacamole and some other ingredients (I had them skip the olives). This was outstanding! And the soup today was a black bean soup that was thick and loaded with black beans. YUM! All for $8 - such a deal. And it is served on real plates with real silverware - a very nice touch. Excellent for a quick lunch that is definitely not \"fast food.\" I will be back again soon.",

I love how the menu is split into sweet, savory, and breakfast crepes - I had a hard time deciding what to order! I settled on the Sunday morning, a breakfast crepe with eggs, potatoes, and cheese. It was huge and just stuffed to the brim with ingredients. It was delicious and I had a hard time finishing it all!  I also got a vanilla latte. The latte was just OK, but I've been spoiled by Sunrise Coffee's lattes so it's hard to compete with those. And as an extra treat to myself, I ordered a sweet crepe, the avalon which has pears, goat cheese, and candied walnuts in it. My girlfriends and I split that one. It was light but still filling. It has a great combination of ingredients that go well together and satisfy a light sweet tooth.  Lou was our cashier and was incredibly friendly and informative. You can tell he really took pride in the restaurant and in the food, which translated in how delicious the food tasted!  There's a camera above the crepe station and TV that shows live feed of crepes being made. That was a cool touch.  I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.This place is a must!",

Since we didn't show up till noon, we did end up waiting for like a half hour for a table, but it was well worth the wait.  I had planned on getting a savory crepe, and then get a dessert one afterwards, but I had also gotten a vanilla latte - so I was pretty full after my crepe and latte :)    I had gotten the Monterey crepe - bacon, eggs, tomato, red, serrano pepper, and cheese.  It was yummy!  And very filling.  Lots of food in that crepe!  My daughter had the Perfect Combination - being a preschooler, she picked and ate mostly the chocolate bits and the strawberries!  But I would say it was a hit with her.  The vanilla latte was also pretty good, and filling.  And the caramel latte that my friend got also looked really good - wished I had ordered that one instead.    The service was also really good.  The owner, Lou, was behind the register, and was very friendly, as was the rest of the staff - always checking on us, and interacting with my LO.    Definitely will be coming here again!  No matter what the wait is.  Definitely want to go back and try one of their dessert crepes!",

    "text": "Once again a big thanks to my fellow Yelpers for steering me to a great spot for something different.  I went to Crepe Expectations today for breakfast.  I looked at the breakfast crepe and decided on the Rosarito although I was tempted to ditch a breakfast crepe and go with sweet.  But, I was good and stayed with the breakfast one.  The Rosarito is filled with chorizo--nicely seasoned with a small kick from the spices, scrambled egg, guacamole, and jack cheese.  With it, I had a very large, tasty cup of coffee.  While waiting for the server to bring your crepe, you can watch them make it on the large flat panel above the cooking stations.  There are three crepe making griddles and the two to the left are shown on the flat panel.  My experience with the good food and with the friendly, helpful staff will assure I'll be back for a dessert crepe.  There are outdoor tables with umbrellas for eating out.  This morning was cool enough it would have been good.  However, I saw the dog water dispenser and dog treats and I opted to stay in.  I am not dog friendly when I'm eating--inside or out.",

Food came out at 11:50am. Other then the excessive wait times, this place is a local gem. Super trendy and fashionable decor. Crepes are large and include a generous portion of ingredients.  Covered outside patio was a great option for a sunny brunch.  Avoid Saturday and Sunday afternoons tho unless you are ready to wait 1hr+ to get seated. Also, no heaters for outside patio which would easily double dining space in the winter months.",

I feel like their portion sizes are a little small however for the prices they charge for their crepes, but as my friend pointed out, \"Dane, these are human-sized portions.\" So perhaps that's just me being an overeating-American. Good job on the food quality-wise, but if they ever decided to give you more food per the price they charge I certainly wouldn't talk them out of it.  They also offer a wide variety of flavors for wine flights as well. I tried the blood-orange, pomegranate, and one of the rose's, a perfect compliment to just about any of the crepes they offer from their menu!",

    "text": "There are seemingly two kinds of crepes that you can get.  The first is the kind that comes from the Crepe Shack - these are acceptable, in as much as they are packed to the gills with sugar (so of course they taste good) and not much else.  The consistency is bland and you will be hungry 30 minutes later.  The second kind of crepe is what you can expect at Crepe Expectations.  It's a perfect texture with fresh, filling ingredients.  To get the negatives out of the way: this place is super cramped and always busy.  It can get  crowded and confusing if you've never been.  Often times you will be helped by an awesomely nice gentleman who will secure you a seat while you go wait in line and order your food.  This is not a full service kind of restaurant - if you want to be waited on hand and foot, go elsewhere. There are servers will who bring you your food and ask you if you need anything else and that's about it.  It's very close quarters eating.  We always end up sitting at the family style table right in the middle and have very little issues with it.  On to the excellence: the food is incredible!  The crepes are cooked to perfection and the flavor is out of this world.  We've had The Monterey, The Crepelet, and the Ana Bananas Foster, among others, and they all were delicious.  Portion sizes are perfect.  You don't leave hungry and even have enough leftover for a little snack later.  The menu is varied and there's no shock value with the pricing.  The cucumber and lemon waters are a nice way to complement your meal.  If you're in the mood for a crepe, be it sweet or savory, you should check this place out.",

The food is FANTASTIC. Even down to the side soup (which I'm obsessed with). The selection is also amazing, more than just your typical bananas and whipped cream. My favourites are The Frisco, The Caprese, and the Ana Bananas Foster. Also-- whoever runs this joint is amazing. The hiring is so well done and the staff seems so engaged and passionate about what they're doing. Everyone is on the same page and ensures speedy (and quality) service , which is such a hard thing to rally considering how busy these guys can be.",

The cashier was funny, calling everyone \"beautiful\" or \"gorgeous\" or \"darling\", and also had the good sense to let me know that their soup of the day was not gluten-free when I mentioned I would like the gluten-free crepes, and would I like a salad instead? Yes, please!  I usually get the Pirate, which is a tuna crepe. I got just that and their lemonade of the day yesterday, and was so full afterwards that I didn't eat for almost 8 more hours--and I couldn't quite finish my crepe, either!   This place is usually crowded, but they have a decent little bar area if you're by yourself, and if you're with others you will get a number and an older man up front will help you find a table (I seem to remember he's the owner, but I could be wrong.)   I really just love this place, and along with Viva Las Arepas, is one of the places I try to hit every time I'm here.",

They had some seats outside, and I really wished I wasn't in a hurry to leave so I could enjoy the nice March weather. They weren't too crowded for Sunday lunch.  I wanted the one with shrimp, since I saw it on the chalkboard menu in the restaurant. However the register dude told me there's no more shrimp and recommended the salmon lox-type crepe, which came with a side salad.  I agreed and waited for my food to be prepared.   When I finally opened my food, I was really disappointed with the salad. There was like five green leaves!  I couldn't stand all the cream cheese without the salad. The crepe itself was good; it had a lot of salmon, which is apparently smoked in house.  It was on the dry side though.  Too bad I got my food to-go.  Maybe it'll be better when you dine in.",

    "text": "Before coming here I thought how good could a crepe be? Now I will forever compare future crepes to the crepes here. I definitely found this spot to be a five star based great food and great service.  As soon as we arrived we were greeted and handed menus to help us make our selections. The same man that greeted us also found us a table where we could settle in after placing our orders. I believe the owner is the one that took our orders at the counter and he was very friendly as well.   I ordered a sweet crepe to take back to the office after lunch which they held off on making until I was almost ready to leave. The man that helps find the tables remembered that my co-worker and I had ordered sweet crepes and offered to get them started as he noticed us finishing up our savory crepes. I was impressed that while checking on all of the tables and greeting everyone that he was so on top of this. Sure enough our crepes arrived right as we were ready to leave. Everything was packaged well and they included silverware.   The actual crepe was the best crepe I've ever had. The taste was excellent and I loved the way it was prepared. For lunch I had the Sonora which was steak, avocado, salsa, and cheese. It was very tasty and I loved the flavor of the steak inside. My dessert pick was the Perfect Combination which was strawberries, chocolate drizzle, and whipped cream. Yum! It was probably enough for two people to share, but I ate the whole thing because it was delicious.  The restaurant isn't huge, but they offer indoor and outdoor seating. It's nice that there is someone to help find tables for you during busy times. The restaurant seemed clean and inviting. I also loved that they have cucumber water and lemon water.   This spot is definitely a winner! I'm so glad that I gave it a try and I'm already thinking about when I can make it back for more deliciousness.",

Asked for my food and a refund for the inconvenience and the waiter told me that's not how it works and I need \"to get in the real world\". Owner just sat there and watched us have an unpleasant experience. No food. No apology. Big waste of time. I was late to work. Thanks Crepe Expectations! First time there and definitely my last. Needless to say I was utterly DISGUSTED with the staff.  Reply: I've been to \"fresh food\" restaurants and it should NEVER take that long to make an omelette and a crepe. I asked for a refund once the food was ready because it was so inconvenient for me. And that doesn't change the fact that your staff was rude and it seems like you're condoning it... nor does it dismiss the fact that people were getting served that got there way after us. If you wanna argue morals thats fine, clearly ours clash. Have a great day!",

Lou (the owner) was taking orders when we arrived to a decent sized line, Lou was super fast taking orders while still being a great host with tons of energy. The crepes themselves were amazing. I highly recommend the Chicken Verde special with lime cream, it was amazing. We had the Ana foster Crepe for dessert and it was spectacular, good sweetness and nice taste of brandy. We also had iced lattes for drinks and for a crepe place the coffee was shocking amazing.   Seating was wide open and service was super fast.",

Crepe Expectations is surrounded by excellent food however, so something must be rubbing off (see: Republic, Pin Kaow, BJ's)  I am always leery of crepe shops because the crepes usually take a long time to prepare and can come out either runny gooey or too thick and firm.  Crepe Expectations makes them just right.  They are fresh and do take a considerable time to come out but are worth the wait.  They have an awesome mix of sweet and savory crepes which helps when attempting to feed a family or a group of friends.  The La Jolla was absolutely fantastic.  For dessert we switched it up with just a Nutella and strawberry.  Awesome!",

    "text": "Crepe Expectations serves up a delicious choice of sweet, savory or traditional breakfast (ie. eggs, bacon, etc.) crepes + beer, wine, & champagne or mimosas.  I'm a total sucker for breakfast & bubbles!  All of the crepes are priced from $5.50-10.  Upon entry you immediately notice the intimate environment.  There are not a lot of tables and they fill quickly.  Don't worry though, they make sure every guest gets a table, no work required on your part.  Their crepes are packed full of top quality ingredients, actually bursting might be a better way to say it,  Normally when I think of crepes, I think of something much smaller.  These are more like the size of a burrito.  Being the unapologetic carnivore that I am, I ordered the Sonora, which comes packed with carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guac, & jack cheese that came with a cup of fideo soup.  The steak was tender & flavorful, and most importantly NOT overcooked with a generous portion equally distributed throughout.  Boyfriend opted for the Ana Bananas Foster, which is just like it sounds with powdered sugar on top and whip cream on the side.  We visited on a Sunday morning, and it was totally hopping.  Despite the rush they sat us down immediately, and served up our bottle of champagne pretty quickly.  Due to the high demand and only 2 crepe chefs, it took a little while to get our order.  But we were happy chillaxing with our champagne together.  Plus the have live crepe cameras, so you can watch them cooking up the yum.  This really gave me an appreciation for the fact that they're cooking each order totally fresh and just for you.  Super bonus points for self serve fresh cucumber and lemon waters.  So simple, yet refreshing and luxurious.  They also offer some custom sodas for order.  Boyfriend is originally from RI, so he got really excited to see Birch Beer on the menu.     I will be back very soon, and when I return I'm dying to try one of these: the Greek, Del Mar, or the Avalon.  I really don't think you can go wrong because we could hear that everyone in the surrounding tables were ecstatic over their dishes.  The girl next to us was a enthusiastic regular, and mentioned that they will do ingredient substitutions or add-ons.",

We ended it with The Monkey. Which I believe is bananas, Nutella, chocolate drizzle, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. When ordering they asked if we wanted to add fresh strawberries. I wouldn't recommend it because it's perfect without them. The service was AMAZING! Everyone was so friendly! And bonus, in the bathroom they have this sea salt scrub that is to die for!

    "text": "Our major 'difficulty' was determining whether it merits a 4 or 5 star rating. Based on everything but the dark, indoor decor, it rates 5 out of 5. Our experience was an excellent one.   1. First, we strongly recommend this crepe restaurant, Crepe Expectations.   2. We ordered Ana's Banana Fosters and one of their (many) signature dishes, the chorizo crepes, and the taste was - as I see another reviewer writing, 'spot on'. Not much in the world of food beats an original taste. Discovering a restaurant that has an entirely unique, hand-crafted, menu of dishes, is remarkable. The coffee was good, including the decaf, and it was endless.  3. The price range was excellent, unexpectedly reasonable for a small, specialized restaurant. The service - we sat outside - was very good at the ordering point and as it was brought to us in a good time frame, outside.   4. The menu has a plethora of unique items but remains 'crepe-centric'. It serves a breakfast, brunch and lunch menu, as well as coffee and liquor items.  5. When we were finished, I actually asked to speak to the owner. I had a suspicion it was the gentleman who was ordering some items - and it was. I complimented him on our enjoyable meals and began talking to him about all things crepe and cooking. It was a good conversation. One item in particular (there are several) that he is proud of is that he does not use is a freezer.   PS - I want to add that although it closes at 3 pm, we were eating and drinking our coffee at 3 pm without any pressure for us to depart. Simply another positive point to mention.",

I ordered the Sonora, which is filled with Carne Asada and guacamole. So flavorful and you can taste the freshness. The soup that came with it was light and a good compliment to the crepes, despite the 100+ weather outside.   What's more is I appreciate good service and friendliness from the staff, and I have to say that I felt right at home at this place. Lou, the owner, came over and asked us how everything was and made sure we were enjoying the food.  Aside from the food, it's a nice eatery. The decor was nice. The only downside, and the reason it lost a star from me, was the fact that they are not open during hours that normal working people would be able to enjoy the food. Since they're on the opposite side of town for me, I'd have to make a deliberate effort to make the trek out to eat some crepes. Regardless, it's definitely worth it!",

Her son is fantastically picky so he ate the shrimps and left the creme and crepe behind, but devoured three bowls of fideo soup ($1 each, yay!)

I love the fact that you can see when they're making your food since I'm such a germaphobic I'm happy that I can see the process and how clean it is kept.  Yes you pay when you come in and then find a spot.  I like to come early, like 9:00 in the morning when they open because if you come later it's usually packed, but well worth the wait if you have the time.  Bottom line, this is the spot for crepes, breakfast crepes, lunch crepes desert crepes, pretty much anytime crepes. Did I mention I love crepes? Well only crepe expectations crepes.  And the wine stuff is cool too.",

    "text": "Totally not what I expected to walk into, much better than my expectations. A cute, cozy little spot with a few tables, some counter space, and some tables outside as well. What we ordered: The Caprese, The Sunday Morning, The Avalon, a vanilla latte and a cafe caramel. Starting with the coffee: excellent! And only $3.75 for a large mug, it was delicious. Now the crepes: the pesto on the Caprese was wonderful, so much flavor. I don't eat chicken but my friend said it was flavorful and high quality. The Sunday Morning was egg, cheese, and seasoned potatoes, everything I love about breakfast wrapped up in a perfectly cooked crepe. The Avalon was sugared pears, candied walnuts, honey and goat cheese. Simply amazing. If you don't like goat cheese, I don't like you! :) The service was wonderful. We could tell the owner was walking around, greeting tables, making sure everyone was happy, and everyone definitely was! I'll be back to try more fantastic crepes soon!",

My husband had the carne asada crepe (can't remember the exact name) with guacamole, tomato sauce, Monterey jack cheese, and I had the Sunday morning crepe with scrambled eggs, potatoes, and cheese. My husband's crepe was soo delicious! We both loved it! Mine was good too but lacked a bit in flavor. I kinda wished I the one my husband got, lol. He also got the watermelon juice and loved it! I got the mango mimosa which was also delicious but I thought it was going to have juice in it with the champagne. It was more of a champagne with mango flavor. Overall, it was a great little restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. The service was also excellent and the workers were friendly. We will definitely be back again!",

Super friendly service - recommended the BBQ Pork Crepe, which was phenomenal, and to only be topped by the cole slaw...OMG - absolutely divine!  Both kids had a fruit crepe (berries and a strawberry/chocolate).  I had the bacon, egg, etc. crepe.  Everything was absolutely delish and this will be a stop every time we visit Vegas.  Loved the water choices (lemon and cucumber), and the kids had a juice blend that was great.  I love how I left full, but didn't leave feeling \"blah\" after the typical eggs/meat/potato breakfast.",

You have to order, and pay at a counter with a huge stack of money folded hinting at a tip.  The set up doesn't utilize space at all.  After 20 minutes, and no chocolate coffee, which was supposed to be delivered, my roommate had to go to the counter, ask, and be met with attitude.  The owner's sorry doesn't cut it!  After another 20 minutes, we finally get a crepe which Paris Buffet can make MUCH better.  It was my first time there, and it will be my last.  Do yourself a favor, and skip this place.

When we walked in the door, my wife realized that it wasn't a traditional restaurant that you sit down and order, and she was at first very hesitant to eat here.  We approached to counter to order, and her reservations were quickly alleviated after talking to the gentleman behind the register, who happened to be the owner.  He suggested the chicken crepe special for our friend, and my wife and I split a sweet and a savory crepe.  We also ordered a Mimosa trio sampler.  It was hard to select between the 13 flavors!  When we come back we are going to add fresh spinach to our savory crepes, especially the Marco Polo crepe that had Italian sausage.  Adding the spinach will make it better.  The owner did suggest that we add mushrooms, which was an excellent recommendation.  Overall the three of us decided the crepes at the Belliago were slightly better, but we all would come back to this place again.  The excellent service, enthusiastic owner, and supporting small businesses with great tasting food makes this place a solid four star adventure.",

The berry crepe with Nutella is a must. I couldn't choose between savory or sweet but since my boyfriend got a crepe with chicken eggs and sausages I went for a sweet one. The crepe itself was delicious. I could eat it by itself. It was flaky and a crispy at the ends with a super light buttery taste all throughout. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking to get breakfast or lunch.",

We shared the monkey, our company got the berry delight and a breakfast yum (can't remember which). They all were huge! Can't imagine finishing one by myself let alone the little one and I shared and we couldn't finish  The strawberries, banana and Nutella was really a good combo without being overly sweet. We didn't want whip cream and the guy who took our order recommended adding strawberries to the monkey which was awesome. The service was excellent, there was a mess made and the guys were helpful and quick to respond. You go up and place your order and get your drinks but they are quite helpful and attentive still The only reason a star is missing as not enough seating during crowded times, we got the last table.",

Food: I can't describe food that delicious! We had the crepe that had cheese, pepperonis, and tomato sauce of sorts. The description does not do it any justice at all... It was yummy! We then ordered the dessert crepe that has Nutella, bananas, and chocolate sauce. It was so good!!! The thing is lots of people can make a crepe, but these were a perfect texture, great flavor, and truly just delicious! There are many options to choose from!

Both were Gluten Free, and both were amazing.  Talked to the owner a bit, mainly about the bucket of Nutella they used - and she told us about how Nutella will soon be distributing their magic chocolate elixer in piping bags (in addition to jars).  The food and ambiance were so good, we went back the next day.  Got there around 10, and it was packed - we were lucky to find two available seats.  By the time we finished, there were about 12 people in line waiting for a seat.  On this trip, I had the Elvis - Bacon, Peanut Butter, Caramel, and Banana.  Yum!  For those that are gluten intolerant:  They really, really, *really* try to keep their gluten free food gluten free, and you can watch every step of the process.  However, the woman running the gluten-free bakery next door who's Celiac said that they aren't perfect, and she can't eat here.  I suspect it depends on how much gluten you can withstand - odds are, there's very, very little included, but this place wouldn't be certified gluten-free.

This was definitely one of the best breakfasts we've had in town. The prices were great, the atmosphere is cool and the food is superb. Mike was so nice and sat and talked to us for a long time (all while taking care of every customer that came in). This place is a breakfast home run.",

I generally like dessert crepes better than savory. Their Nutella Hazelnut crepe definitely hits the spot. Lastly, the owners are super nice! they genuinely care about their customers. Every time I'm in the Vegas area, I make the extra effort to drive out and eat at this place. Totally worth the drive out.",

    "text": "This was a bad idea. Shame on you people for leaving such glowing reviews to this totally ordinary place.   Plus: The sweet crepes were made with fresh fruit, whipped cream on the side. The dough was thin and fluffy. The savory little Italy one had watery marinara sauce inside the dough (surprising).   Minus: No taste to speak of. There was the dough on one hand, the cream on the other, etc... Just like having them next to one another on the plate. The little Italy was difficult to pick up due to watery composition.   Service: there was a waiting list (10 minutes). However the older customer manager guy forgot to mention that the outside area was open too (nobody was sitting there) so we waited in the cramped place by the restroom for a table to open. We were in a hurry and don't like drafty noisy dark places - minus one point. We ordered 5 crepes (4 sweet, 1 savory) and we got only 4. Again, hurry so we did not have time to order/have made another. Minus one point. Ordinary food - minus one point.   This place might be at the top of the list for the Henderson customers (friends or relatives of owner?) but it's a total waste of time for anyone else.  ====  Update: I just got a bully email from a user \"Jonathan B\". He advised that I'm a loser and I need to \"stay my ass at home\". Thank you, I think you are the owner? I wish I did.",

When I left I talked about this crepe for like 3 days straight not missing an opportunity to tell everyone I came in contact with about it.   Today I tried the Caprese w/ chicken and it was excellen, maybe a little pesto-ie... (Still not as good as the Avalon!) My guy had the Marco Pollo for the second time so I'm assuming he really enjoyed that.   The first time we went I asked for the Mimosa trio. I thought, what could be better than an assortment of flavored Mimosa's! But sadly I was wrong. The flavors were like flavor shots which made the mimosa's entirely too sweet.  Today I opted for a traditional mimosa which was much better.   The only thing negative about this place is that it tends to get busy and you can get stuck with a 30 min wait, but... It's pretty worth it.",

To sum it up, I would say this place is like a suburban version of Jean Philippe Patisserie, complete with fancy free water infused with lemon, and water infused with cucumbers. And man, was Will Ferrell right. Those cucumbers really make the water refreshing!  The ambiance is really relaxing and has a sort of dark, romantic, date-like atmosphere. I also get that this place focuses on \"traditional\" French crepes, but at around $8 a crepe, I have a hard time justifying coming here when Crepe Shack is just down the street. But that's just me and my preference for handy dandy crepes in a cone. However, I will say that the Avalon crepe (I think that's what it's called) with the goat cheese and pears and all that, was A-MAH-ZING. I would totally come back just for that! I mean, it's not like the crepes are bad, in fact they're quite good here. The price is just... not my cup of tea.   Hmmm, maybe if someone else were footing the bill...",

    "text": "4.5 stars if I could.  Happy New Year!  I wanted to try something new and this has always been on my list.  The gist of this place is crepes but with a twist.  Instead of just the \"sweet\" treat that you normally expect a crepe to be, this joint also offers \"savory\" and \"breakfast\" selections.  My wife and I tried the Sonora (carne asada, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, jack cheese) from the savory menu and the Monkey (nutella, banana, chocolate drizzle, fresh whipped cream, powdered sugar and added strawberries for 50 cents more) from the sweet menu.  The portions were great.  Big enough to fill you up on your first meal.  The Sonora came with a soup or salad and I asked for some of the home made salsa on the side to dip.   The Sonora reminds me of a delicious Mexican burrito.  Just enough spicy kick to it.  The lighter crepe pancake vs. a whole tortilla wrap from a traditional burrito was a good change from the norm.   My wife who doesn't even like spicy foods enjoyed it as well.  The Monkey was obviously my wife and daughter's favorite.  Even I couldn't resist a few bites of this delicious treat.  There were ample amounts of fruit and chocolate filling inside and we found ourselves cleaning the plate of every piece.  Very enjoyable.  The reason I can't give a perfect 5 is because of the confusion I'd assume plenty of new customers would get like ourselves the moment you walk in the door.  As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted by a server.  He seated us very promptly and handed us menu's and then left.  We waited patiently for him to return to offer to take our order and maybe serve us waters to start.  He never did return and it wasn't until minutes later that we realized that we had to go up and order at the counter.  Why give us menus at the table if we have to walk up and look at the menu at the front anyways?  Unfortunately, other customers who walked in after we did had already placed their orders and the wait for our food ended up longer than it had to be.  (~20 min).  Cucumber water and lemon water were complimentary but also self-serve.  Good to have known that from the start.    With that aside, delicious food and would definitely come back again.",

We ordered one from the breakfast crepe category and one from the sweet, as a dessert.  Rosarito (from the breakfast menu but is served all day): STUFFING has chorizo, scrambled egg, guacamole, and jack cheese in it. Generous amount of chorizo but NOT GREASY! Loved it, flavorful too... the crepe wrap itself has the best consistency, not too dry and not too soggy.  Nutty Classic: STUFFING nutella, fresh hazelnuts, whipped cream, sliced banana. Who doesn't like nutella and hazelnuts? With the sliced banana and yummy wrap, they can't make it a more perfect sweet crepe!  They also have mimosa trio sampler, I tried water melon, pomegranate, passion fruit, blood orange, white peach, and blackberry... my personal favorite was the water melon.",

Fresh lemonade of the day was a great add-on.  The sides that came with each dish were a nice complement to the crepe.  Very reasonable prices, and service was very personable.  Nice beverage choices to complement the crepes.  Great setting as we sat outdoors in the shade on a patio on a 75 degree day.",

    "text": "BEWARE: most of these 5 star reviews are bogus! The owner is disgustingly rude and offensive! This place is a ticking time bomb!   I came here because I saw the place mentioned on the food network. So I thought it would be a great place to go when visiting Vegas - I was wrong. As I was inside with my daughter a party of 6 arrived. They all ordered and sat down. It wasn't very busy at all. However, the cashier got one of the orders wrong and that upset the owner Lou very much. He was furious started yelling, and insisted that they never got the order wrong and said that they would have to pay again if they wanted a new order. Well that didn't sit with the party of 6 very well and the owner and the other guest got into a full blown argument. The owner and the guests were all yelling and cursing at each other. I never saw such terrible customer service ever in my life! It was like a movie! The owner came from behind the counter and walked towards the guests- 5 women and 1 man-and he charged at them as if he was going to hit one of the women. That disgusted me even more. I mean him cursing and yelling while children were in his establishment was bad enough. But once he walked towards the women and called them bitches I was done! After he told them to leave I was so scared as a bystander because the guest threw all there food on the ground and attempted to push over the table! The owner should never allow situations as small as a wrong order get that out of hand! The customer service here is beyond terrible! After the guest walked out they even broke some wine glasses that were left on the table from previous customers! When the owner came back inside he was so rude to everyone and never even apologized for the terrifying altercation that had just took place!  If you want to come here and possibly be caught in the cross fire as angry customers battle it out with this disgusting owner this is the place for you! If not I recommend going somewhere else because it's only a matter of time before he's rude to someone else and they get into another terrifying brawl. I will never be back!",

My personal favorite was Blood Orange...but I like any alcohol with blood orange. I could drink a carafe to myself. The only complaint and it's really minor, they don't sell the mimosas in carafes. The best thing is there was only a 15 minute wait at 11:30am. Can't complain about that. If I'm down in this area, I will return!! I only wish I came here sooner. A hidden treasure that must be discovered!!",

    "text": "Coffee, mimosas and crepes- what more could I for?  Crepe Expectations has savory and sweet crepes. The restaurant is the perfect little place to get brunch on a Sunday morning.... as long as you're not going with a huge group of friends or planning on chit chatting for hours. The restaurant is small and busy- they'll have to kick you out if you stay too long! Sonora: With carne asada, guac, cheese and salsa this tasted like a flattened burrito. It was really good and stuffed full. It wouldn't be my idea of brunch food, but I wouldn't be opposed to ordering it again. The soup that it came with was very tomato-y. Again, it didn't go very well with my mimosa/coffee combo.  The Monkey: No one can do nutella and banana wrong. The Monkey was sweet and the perfect thing to eat for brunch.  If you're here with more than one person. Order one sweet, one savory. The savory was a lot more filling, but you won't get that satisfied feeling without the sweet crepe.  The shop is a little dark for my liking and can get pretty loud with how small it is. There are seats in the very back of the restaurant for you to sit at if they're full- order at the counter!",

I finally gave in and told the hubs lets try this place.  Our first time eating here, we go to sit inside in front of where the crepes are made.  After watching how they made them and being able to see all the varieties that are available, the light went off.  Now I understand why this place is always packed.  Huge crepes, lots of flavor, awesome service.   They are decently priced, have beer and mimosas on the menu...for breakfast.  Thats my combo.  I love breakfast.  Dessert for a meal and alcohol?  Thats what I'm talking 'bout.  The cons are obvious, long wait.  Oh, inside, the tables are a bit higher.  For those of us that are a bit short (I'm very short) sitting up high gets tired on the legs (HEHE).     The varieties they have on the menu is good for an indecisive person like me.  I have never been disappointed all the times I have been here.  I have to tell you, the last time we were there, it just opened and we got seated right away.  We just got out of the car and knew to seat us.  Thats awesome service for ya!",

I can tell that this place can get packed because we came on a Monday around lunchtime and the inside was pretty full!   The crepes were yummy! We ordered the Little Italy (I think that's what it's called- there's pepperoni) and William Tell (apples and caramel). The pepperoni one came with either soup or salad- we chose to go with the soup and it was delicious! The broth was a little salty but I enjoyed it a lot!   Their menu has a lot of variety so we definitely will be coming back to try different things!",

We arrived at 2:30 PM RIGHT before they were closing for the day. Unfortunately, we had to take our crepes to order, but we understood because they were closing soon so it wasn't a big deal.   We ended up ordering the William Tell crepe (sauteed apples, caramel, powered sugar and whipped cream) and the Berry Delight crepe (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, powered sugar and whipped cream).  While waiting, I noticed some Star Wars decorations so I was taking a photo with my phone when the owner came out. He was super sweet, struck up a conversation and invited me back to see his other decorations and also his signed Guy Fieri poster from Triple D (I hadn't known this restaurant was even on the show!). So that was so neat and he was just so chill and welcoming.  We got our crepes and went on our way. They were delicious! The berries on mine were very fresh and the crepe itself was delicious. My friend tried hers and said the apples were yummy, crunchy and tart. And her not normally being a whipped cream fan, she was surprised that she liked theirs! We'll definitely be back when we are on that side of town again!",

I just go right Into it. The price is amazing for the amount and size you get. I can never finish my portion. The owner is mainly the cashier, he's always in such a great mood. The wait time to order just depends on how busy they are. But I don't mind, the crepes are amazing! I had their micheladas here, not the best I'd say. But I don't come here for the micheladas. So I'm still giving this place a 5 star! The staff is awesome, they stop in the middle of what they are doing to answer your questions. Clean spot, they have an outside and inside dinning area, and they provide water for their guests due to the heat. I love their outside area, makes you feel like you are in a tourist area. LOVE IT!",

    "text": "We have been coming here for a while.  They just changed locations to a larger spot with a courtyard near their old location.  They needed the extra room as they get pretty crowded.  I will list the pros and cons as I see them:  Pros: -Staff is very friendly (especially Mike who works the seating and outdoor area) -Food is very good.  Crepes are delicious and they have all kinds to choose from.    -Coffee is tasty and smooth -Large outdoor courtyard is nice  Cons: -Having to order at a counter (I think full service would be better with this new location.  This worked at the old spot better, but it no longer seems to be working) -Self serve coffee area (it is not appealing and it is set up poorly.  Plus, the mugs are large and have small handles, making them hard to carry.  Plus, with lots of people and traffic it is dangerous to have people carring huge mugs of coffee around.) -Large delivery truck with loud engine running the entire time we were eating.  I realize this is not really their fault, but they should tell the driver to make deliveries in the back.  Not enjoyable to be eating your breakfast outside with a giant truck engine running and stinking up the area.) -Could be a little cleaner.  It is not bad, but I have noticed some cleanliness issues here and there.    Overall, the good outweigh the bad.  Good, unique place to eat!",

    "text": "I came in here for brunch, and it was fairly busy, but not packed. My mom and I were greeted, and we were asked if we had ever been here before. Since we said no, the waitress explained that we could order at the counter, seat ourselves, and the dishes would be brought out to us. She was very friendly!  We ordered the Rosarito (chorizo, scrambled egg, cheese, and guacamole) and Berry Delight (strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries). The Rosarito came with a side of bananas or cottage cheese, which wasn't listed on the menu, so I was a bit unprepared to make a choice at the register since I was sharing it. Anyway, I ordered the cottage cheese to go with my crepe. The sweet crepe didn't come with any side. You do have an option of adding on potatoes, but I figured the portions might be too big to finish if I ordered it.  My first impression of the crepes was that it was huge, so come hungry! The Rosarito crepe was okay. I picked this because it seemed to have a bit more fillings than some of the other offerings under the breakfast crepes. The chorizo was about dry, and tasted like ground beef to me. I didn't notice the egg in his crepe too much and only really noticed the other ingredients, especially the chorizo. They gave a fair amount of guacamole so that was cool, but it wasn't really seasoned, and seemed like it was just smashed avocado. The Berry Delight was also just okay. I liked that they gave a lot of fresh berries and didn't skimp, but the strawberries were a bit sour, and for that, I wished there was more whipped cream on the side or powdered sugar. I'd probably opt to get a sweet crepe that has a bit of a filling (think other crepes with goat cheese or Nutella) than just fruit inside. If you want to try multiple crepes and are in the company of friends/family, I recommend splitting up different crepes to sample. Basically I had my main savory crepe and my dessert crepe!  Overall, the crepes were fair, I wasn't super impressed to make another trip back out. However the service was good, and this place seems pretty popular even on the weekdays.",

Customer service is awesome, I love how the owners are hands on (my husband recognized them from a TV show they participated in) and they make sure you feel welcomed!

Patio looks super fun (not at 110 degrees though, no Patio could ever be fun at 110, but people were sitting out there) and the Crepes all sounded pretty good and were priced well.  Rolled up to the register and the bearded gentleman could not have been more charming and personable, later I found out this is the legendary \"Lou\" who owns the place. He was delightful. I got a Savory Pizza-ish Crepe and a Sweet (but not too sweet) peach Crepe. They were superb and really decent sized especially for the price. Fideo soup was really good too! AND THEY HAVE BOOZE.  Even the woman who just handed us our food (to go) was exceedingly pleasant. I wish I had more stars to give. I'm gonna go back this week!",

We arrived Sunday morning, very busy, but the line moved quickly and the kind man had tables ready for everyone. Lou greeted us at the counter with genuine enthusiasm and pride. He is the co-owner, along with his wife. We chatted during the transaction and felt right at home. We ordered the Avalon and the Greek, and a mimosa trio. Do yourself a favor and get the trio! You select the flavors from a large variety. And they cone filled to the rim! Personally, my favorite is mango, but they were all delicious. The Avalon is perfectly paired with pears and goat cheese, simply scrumptious. And The Greek- nothing but pre heaven in my mouth. Wow! Perfectly grilled chicken that tastes grilled and not dry, fresh spinach, kalamata olives, red onion, feta cheese and tzaziki marry perfectly into the crepe. I enjoyed it so much, I had to return Monday for another one! And for $8, it's a real bargain. Thank you for a most memorable meal and my new favorite place!",

Yes, this is the Diners, Drive Ins and Dives place and there is some memorabilia inside to prove it.  As far as I recall, this is a family owned husband-wife combo.  First things first...the drinks.  They do a mimosa sampler with choices of like 11 flavors.  They are delicious and reasonably priced.  The crepes....well, you can see for yourself as they make them right in front of you.  They are incredible.  They have sweet/dessert ones, and more savory meat/veggies ones as well.  I believe mine was the \"Monte Carlo\", which was sausage egg and cheese and \"The Perfect Combination\" which was strawberries, chocolate and whip cream.  They were just so light and delicious that I had to try one of each!  I commented at the time this was one of my better restaurant experiences in a while.  The owner was super kind to everyone, the food and drinks were great.  I can't recommend this place enough.",

    "text": "Shocked at how bland the food was. That being said, we only had four items, so I would be very open to go back and try some other items and see if they're better.  1. The latte... was a joke. It was very diluted - that is, watered down. It was very poorly done. 2. The steak crepe - the meat was horrible. What was listed on the menu was 'carne asada steak'. The real problem is expectations - they should have given a description of how it was cooked. It was essentially, braised beef. Like having under-cooked pot-roast. If I had known that, I never would have ordered it.  2. The chorizo crepe - the blandest chorizo I've ever eaten. That, and the fact that 90% of the filling was chorizo, it was very unbalanced. It needed less chorizo, more egg, cheese, etc.  3. The soup - probably the best of the day, but not all that great. Not bad, just not that good either.  Like I said, I wouldn't mind trying some of the other items, but since we don't live locally, and there's a thousand other places we haven't eaten, we won't be back. Fool me once...  BTW, the service was great, very friendly and professional people working there. Just wish I could help them adjust their recipes so they're decent. Maybe that's what passes as good food in that area... don't know.",

The Veggie Patch: It's probably the healthiest and most filling crepe on the menu. It's definitely something for the vegetarians who come here but don't want to eat a sugar loaded crepe. The roasted vegetables had a good smokey flavor and the hummus paired well with it. I'm not sure I'd get it again, but I'm happy a healthy option is available.   The Avalon: WOW. This crepe has pears, goat cheese, honey, and candied walnuts. Definitely not a healthy option, but amazingly delicious. The honey is incredibly fragrant -- almost like I've never had honey before. I love how savory the goat cheese and is a good combination with the sweet pears. It also comes with a side of vanilla flavored whipped cream which tastes great.   Cute interior where you can watch the crepes be made. The patio is nice shaded and provides for great options to sit outside. I would easily come here again.",

The sitting and ordering situation confused me a bit. You walk up and someone greets you, asks how many, and if you want to sit inside or outside. Then they tell you to order inside then come back out when you've ordered to have a seat... it just seemed unorganized to me.   The cashier was very enthusiastic and in a very happy mood, despite how busy it was. I ordered The Greek with grilled onions, feta, tatziki, red onions, olives, and tomatoes -- hold off on the olives and tomatoes. It came with the option of soup or salad. There was a lot of flavor but it probably would've been better without the humongous chunks of feta, although I do love feta!   There was self-serve water -- choice of lemon water or cucumber water. I do believe they have mimosas there, too, if you're a hardcore brunch-er! They have alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.   I'd probably come back when I'm craving some sweet crepes, just to try something new!",

Now that I live here again I'll be going back often.",

The kitchen was open and you could see everything going on in the back but then ... Lou came out and greeted us and introduced himself... what a warm welcome!  Made us feel like we were family coming over to his house for breakfast.   The food was fantastic and very reasonably priced. Decor was simple and unassuming with a very nice outdoor patio. Oh and Lou, thanks for that special treat before breakfast ;).  P.S. If you are staying on the strip, Crepe Expectations is only 10 min from the strip and even if you the add in the cost of an Uber out here, both you and your wallet will still be ahead of any breakfast joint on the strip",

Might sound strange, but trust me the lunches are actually my fav. They also have 3 mimosas for only $10. Best price in town and they have like 15 flavors. Can't go wrong here.

I was previously a worker at a crepe shop so I understand why it takes forever for crepes to come out and maybe sometimes in different orders. Of course, this is something that can always be fixed. If you plan on eating somewhere on a short time crunch, this is not the place to go. Practice some patience, will ya?  Their crepes, both savory and sweet, are DELICIOUS. The crepe is cooked so well, it's soft and almost melts in your mouth. I have tried a bunch of different crepes, and depending on what YOU like, you will love it. My favorites were the carne asada and the nutella banana and strawberry. They always hook me up with whipped cream too!  The owners are super nice and it is quite small, yet demanding, so people just need to be aware of the wait times. You gotta wait for good stuff sometimes.  Definitely a place you should try out!  PS, Mimosa trios=excellent.",

He knows how to entertain a crowd and  deliver something yummy at the same time. He gives a show while making crepes. Sounds crazy? It's not, it's great. We are in Vegas after all. Lou's crepe spot is an awesome place for locals too. I am a SUPER crepe snob and Lou delivers that batter and finished product, by far! I actually recommend the tuna crepe (I know sounds weird but I was pregnant the first time I tried it and I've been hooked since the baby popped out) and the old faithful classic crepe with lemon and sugar (a representation of how good a place's crepe really is). There are many others that are good, like the southwest and pretty much anything he offers a special.   In the words of The Smiths, \"Please, please, please,\" try this place!!",

    "text": "I LOVED this place!  Family and friends recommended this place to me previously but I had never been despite their recommendations. I finally went here (because it's off the strip so hence we don't always want to drive more) and OMG was it worth it! Let me start by saying the bf and I both liked their mimosa selections and tasting- we each got 4 different flavors. I would steer clear of the peach because it was WAY too sweet. I surprising liked the tangerine and the pineapple the most. The watermelon one was okay.   Bf had a regular savory crepe (I don't remember which one, but it had bacon) and it was delicious. There was some sauce on it and I think it would have been better if they hadn't been so heavy handed with it but it was pretty freaking good.  I had a sweet crepe with berries and I even asked for extra berries. My crepe, of course, was gluten free. It was much thicker and more like a pancake than a crepe and therefore super filling. However, if you regularly (or just have ever) eaten a gluten pancake you will know that what they have here certainly qualifies as a crepe as opposed to a pancake. If you have not eaten gluten free pancake then you will feel like this is too thick to be a crepe, but it isn't. I could not finish my crepe because it was so large. It was a little too sweet for me but it might not be for others.  Overall the service was good too, entertaining to watch them make the crepes, food came quickly, bathrooms were clean, etc. Honestly this is a 4.5-5 star rating but I feel like I haven't tasted enough to give it the full 5 stars.   Come after peak time, like after 12 or 12:30 to walk right in.",

I mean I could've made this crepe in 5 minutes at home for $3.00. It was pretty bland.

The staff was incredibly enthusiastic and friendly and overall seem happy to be there and serve.   The menu provides the perfect amount of options and leaves you wanting to return time and time again to try everything!   The flavors were perfect and the side salad paired nicely with the crepe.   The quaint outdoor seating is a nice touch and while some may scoff at how intimate you can get with your neighbors meeting new friends only added to the experience for us.   Little things like the tip origami, the salt scrub in the bathroom, the art, and the complimentary cucumber and lemon water are all added bonuses!   Our experience was blissful!

    "text": "Crepe was tasty but the restaurant is not a place to dine alone.   I love crepes and this morning I was in the mood for some - *both* savory and sweet. I went here b/c of the good reviews and it started out pleasant enough... A gentleman was standing outside and welcomed me in as he took me to my table, a nice corner table by the door which I said to him was \"perfect.\" (I have a sensitivity condition so generally when I go out to eat, I prefer sitting away from the bustle of people). As soon as I started to sit in my chair, he changed his tune and asked me to sit in a middle table at the banquet wall on the other side of the room. Mind you, he was the one who took me to the original corner table so it was extremely disappointing to have him change his mind as I was sitting down. I don't like banquet seating - and especially not being squished between other tables so when he asked me to switch tables I decided to just take something home rather than put myself in an uncomfortable situation.   I went to the counter to place my order (a sweet crepe with pears, goat cheese and honey which had quite a decent amount of filling) but as I was standing watching the chef's create the crepes, they asked if I wanted to sit in the side corridor while I wait. It was a long, dark corridor where I'd just be staring at a dark wall three feet in front of me. Not interested!  I travel for business all around the world, and have MANY relatives in Paris, so I appreciate a good crepe when I can find one. I also find that the True test of a good restaurant is how well they treat me when I'm dining alone. Do they give me the same quality of service and attentiveness as with larger tables or do they ignore me and/or treat me different b/c they think one person will not spend as much as a larger table. I was quite hungry and had planned to eat two crepes in addition to libations but the disappointing treatment made me shorten my order and my visit. Their loss. I actually thought the crepe was quite tasty and the person who gave it to me put a dollop of whip cream in a separate container without my having to ask - so that the heat of the crepe wouldn't melt the whipped cream.  What's even more disappointing is that the person seating people put a couple at the table I was originally going to sit at - two people who could have just as easily sat at the second table he wanted to move me to... Next time I'll find somewhere else to enjoy a crepe.",

If not you have to wait for an available table before they will take your order. Wait was only 5-10mins. Once you order they give you a number to take to your assigned table. There is a wide selection of savory and sweet crepes. They also have mimosas, wine and beer. Price is very reasonable. Crepes were excellent. Service was decent. Don't expect fine dining service. It's more like a deli style of service. Overall very cute little place that has great food if you love crepes. Will definitely come back!",

    "text": "Crepes are the new cupcake. Move over rich frosting because this lighter pastry is coming to take over. Before you would have to go to the strip to get one of these Parisian delights. Now you can get them outside of that parameter.   Crepe Expectations lures you in with a play on words, settles you in with boutique decor, and snags you with their divine crepes. My sister and I split the Frisco. A mellow crepe with a thin layer of lemon curd, handfuls of blueberries, a light dusting of powder sugar, and a side of fresh whipped cream. We accompanied this with the mimosa trio. They have five flavors to choose from; pomegranate, lychee, original, passion fruit, and  white peach. We had ordered the first two and the last. The tart acidity of the pomegranate cut the champagne nicely. The lychee had a subtle sweetness, but did not mask the flavor of the alcohol. The white peach was our least favorite. From start to finish it was bitter. I wished my sister would have been honest when the owner asked us, but after she said everything was delicious, it was too late.   I appreciated that the owner took the time to come out and talk to us. Asking how we heard about the place. Stalking Yelp sure does pay off. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff are polite. The prices are mid range compared to other crepe places. Everything is made in house except for the hummus. You can definitely taste the freshness in their ingredients. There is also a TV overhead so that you can watch them prepare your crepe.  Everything about this place warrants another visit. Next time I will try their pear and goat cheese one.",

    "text": "Absolutely amazing! I've been here a couple of times now and each time, there was nothing to complain about, at all. The staff is extremely friendly and very attentive to every customer. The owner actually works the cash register and if you can't decide from the many excellent choices, he'll offer a suggestion.    As for food, I've tried a few and loved them all. For the savory crepes, I've tried the Sonora, the Caprese, and one of their specials, I believe it's called the Clucker. The Sonora is like a Mexican burrito, with a crepe instead of the tortilla. When I said that, the owner responded with, \"Yeah, like a burrito, but better\" and I totally agree. The meat and guacamole were well seasoned and the meat was still very tender. The Caprese was also very good, I loved the pesto! The Clucker was filled with chicken, chorizo, and some cheese and it was super flavorful. The chorizo gave a nice little kick and the chicken was still very moist. All of them were packed full, you definitely get your money's worth, in quality and quantity.   The one sweet crepe I tried was the Frisco and it was mm mm tasty. The lemon curd was not too sweet or too sour and there was just the perfect amount of it, not overpowering the crepe or the blueberries. Also, that bad boy was FILLED with blueberries. There had to have been at least an entire 4oz package of blueberries in that thing!  Each of the savory crepes came with a side of soup or salad, although the Clucker, since it was considered a breakfast crepe had the choice of banana too. When I first ordered, I asked for the banana, but quickly changed my mind wanting the salad, and the owner said he would just tell the staff. When my food came, it came with the banana and I said I changed it to a salad. The waiter just threw in the salad on top of the banana! Seriously, really great service here.   I can't wait to come back and try more of the crepes, if only they were open a little later. Not a big morning person, but I will make the effort to wake up earlier for this place, and so should you!",

The ingredients are quality and it made for a great light meal. My wife ordered a Caprice and while ordering had a pregnant craving and added ham. Upon receiving her meal she immediately wished she hadn't added ham(pregnancy messing with her) the owners noticing that she wasn't completely happy immediately offered to take it back and remade her order even though neither of us had asked for that. Both owners (Husband & wife) were very friendly and were very happy to engage in a conversation. We loved Crepe Expectations and will be back.  Oops. I guess I didnt save this. A year and a half later the place is under new ownership. The new owners are also very nice. Food is still great and fresh. The Frisco could use more curd but all in all it is all great!",

You get to choose from a variety of sides; soup, salad, bananas, & cottage cheese. Not only that, but service was fantastic. The gentleman on register was awesome at giving suggestions (if there's anything I hate, it's when the person suggesting says \"everything is great\". That either means you don't know or you haven't tasted any of them), but he was honest about what were some of his favorites and the crowd favorites. We were also checked on a few times to make sure everything was going well.   Parking was easy since this restaurant is located in a pretty large strip mall. Would definitely return if in the area!",

They have a Gluten Free mixture so no one has an excuse for not trying this place.  Gluten lovers and Gluten Free needs can be met so since this is one of my favorite places for anytime of day, I hope to cross paths with all who read this.  You will not be disappointed, as I or anyone who has been here has been.  From the service to the drink to the overall family atmosphere, this is a place for all to enjoy including k9 lovers.",

I told my friend Chastine V. how awesome it was so we met for brunch....I had the Pirate with the mimosa trio (orange, white peach and passion fruit).  Once again, loved every bite and sip of this meal!  Finally, my husband agreed to go because I wouldn't stop raving about it!  He had the Sonora...awesome!  And I tried the Greek...very delicious.

I love the staff they are always so friendly and nice with attention to detail . The decor is nice and modern but still cozy They have sweet , savory , creative crepe you name it. . They allow you add or take away ingredients as you please. I love the blood orange mimosas, they also have a cool list of root beers and classic sodas. They make me feel like family coming over for lunch/ brunch. if you want a damn good crepe this is the place . This place is only open in the am and usually packed on the weekends. Now I like their new addition of canopies outside to block the sun with the outside seating. Get the monkey or Avalon, and their Fideo soup is awesome.   Now I have read the reviews online  and I will say the  putting my name on a list and standing while waiting for a table does not bother me at all. This is a mom and pop place people, it cozy and friendly with  Darn good food at reasonable prices . I don't expec, It's just crepes without the frills. Sometimes I go on weekdays and its empt and you can spend an hour or two chatting with a bottle of champagne while having your crepe. If you go on a Sunday during the  farmers market you will have a 20 o 30 min wait  to be seated then wait for your food and it will be loud from all the hustle and bustle.",

    "text": "I swear, crepes are the new cupcake; for this, I am immensely grateful! Seeing this place open up recently, my brother and I decided to give it a go. Whereas down the street, they're serving Japanese-style crepes - this place is all about the traditional Parisian crepes.   My brother and I shared the Mimosa Trio and the Frisco crepe. The trio featured a white peach, pomegranate, and lychee mimosa. Lychee was simply to die-for while white peach boasted a bitter taste. On the other hand, the Frisco, adorned with lemon curd, blueberries, and powdered sugar, was orgasmic. Talking to the owner, she said she made everything in-house other than the hummus, and for this, I am impressed. Homemade lemon curd? There's nothing better.  What struck me the most was the ambiance. Enduring the brutal Vegas heat from the parking lot walk, entering Crepe Expectations is a nice, welcomed change. Intimate, dimly light, and well-decorated, Crepe Expectations is perfect transition from Vegas heat and sun.",

    "text": "Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for recommending this fabulous eatery.  I wanted to try the Griddle, but upon checking out their Yelp review, I decided to switch to Crepe Expectations.  My significant other and I stopped in on Saturday for a late breakfast.  The decor was modern-which I enjoyed.  They have two projection screen tv's.  Perfect for my guy since the football game was on. (He didn't miss any action)  They also had the crepe cam where you can watch them make your food.  I ordered the Rosarito which had chorizo, avocado, cheese and egg.  It was delicious! I my opinion, the crepe's thickness was perfect. There was so much food stuffed into it, and it didn't break.  The watermelon on the side was a nice fresh touch to my plate.  I also had the pomegranate mimosa which was TO DIE FOR!  I very much appreciate they use the good champagne and not the cheap one.    He ordered the crepe with egg, cheese and bacon.  It wasn't as stuffed as mine, but he swore it filled him up (which is hard to do, he eats a ton!).    Lastly, the service was impeccable.  The lady who took our order came by later and asked how our food was.  This experience was so delightful, I took my girlfriend to eat there the next day.  This time I had the Very Berry Crepe.  It was smaller than I expected.  The fruit in the crepe was fresh and not canned, which I liked, but they were rather watery.  This crepe left me still hungry once I finished.  Overall, I would definitely eat here again but most likely order the breakfast crepes unless I was just looking for a desert.",

After sitting there enjoying good conversation and tasty crepes, the staff come outside and pull in tables and chairs. A short while later they start tearing down the canopy that was providing shade. Mind you, we haven't finished eating yet. Those canopies I'm sure are full of dust and we are still eating. A few minutes later we are asked if we are finished. We clearly are not because their is still food on our plates. A few minutes after that a grey hair'd man comes out and informs my friend she has 8 minutes to finish her food because they close at 3 sharp. Just when you think you've experienced the worst, out comes this big burly guy and tells both my friend and I \"Your time's up.\" I will NEVER... Did I spell that right? Just so there is no confusion... I WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER VISIT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN NOR WILL I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE! I cannot stand rude customer service. I have family in the food and service industry and you NEVER ask a paying customer to leave!!!",

Maybe it was a glitch, since they have only been open for a short time.  I love the interior of the restaurant, different shades of purple, sooo cool.  The owners Larry & Ana are very accommodating and my favorite thing is I don't have to go to the Strip for a crepe, they are right down the street from my house.   I'm delighted to know that they now serve GLUTEN FREE crepes, big plus in my book.  New Note:  They have new owners but they are very accommodating and the food is still great!",

My gal pals Allison and Jessie had nothing but good things to say about this place, so we chose it for our weekly brunch spot one Saturday morning.   This is an order at the register, then seat yourself kinda place. The chef/owner was our cashier, and he was so welcoming and friendly. As Jessie put it \"I always feel like my business is appreciated when I come here.\" She couldn't be more correct. All of the staff I encountered were friendly and they seemed genuinely happy to serve us. This is one of the main reasons I love supporting local businesses. We were seated outside on the patio, which was great because the weather was nice. They also have seats inside, but be prepared to wait. The place is small and always packed! This, however, is a good thing!  Onto the food. I couldn't make up my mind, there were sweet and savory crepes and they all sounded delicious. I didn't even know you could get a savory crepe! I ended up with the Reuben crepe which comes stuffed with corned beef, sauerkraut and thousand island. It even had fennel sprinkled on the outside of the crepe! It was realllllly good. My crepe came with either a side salad or a cup of soup. I chose the latter, and it was pretty good. It was a light, chickeney broth with noodles. Not too heavy, but tasty and perfect for a side dish.  Jessie and I decided to split the mimosa sampler, which comes with 3 flavors of your choice. All of the flavors sounded amazing, but we went with white peach, watermelon and blood orange. The sampler glasses are pretty small, so I would advise each person getting their own. Anyway the white peach was definitely my favorite flavor.   I really enjoyed this place and I will definitely be back. I love supporting local businesses, and they have some amazing sweet crepes that I am dying to try.",

Would definitely eat here again.   Also ordered a fresh squeezed orange juice. Not sure if it was because of my crepe, but it tasted kind of bitter.  Service is impeccable! Very friendly, welcoming, and efficient staff and owner.",

Food was delicious with good portions, both savory, breakfast (served anytime), and sweet. Definitely a place for either a meal or just a snack. They have a great selection of wines and beers, too. Their mimosas rawk! The staff and boss were simply awesome, enthusiastic, polite and very helpful. Best of all, they are soon moving a couple doors down to a bigger space. This place is a new favorite for us!",

They seem to do better on the savory crepe side. When it comes to sweet crepes, they tend to stick to your basic fruit, powdered sugar, whipped cream, and Nutella combinations. I was really hoping to see some with specialty jams, pudding, or homemade sauces. Overall, the crepes were good but not out-of-this world. The price was fair but the place was a bit crowded and noisy for me to want to be a regular.",

Much to our disappointment, the crepes were average and the latte was horrible. We ordered a berry delight crepe for dessert and it was dry and tasted like something we could have made at home. The whip cream did not taste homemade. My vanilla latte was made by a nespresso machine which I paid $3.75. The place did not have milk substitutes such as soy or almond milk. We came from California with Crepe Expectations but left with disappointment. Definitely not worth the drive from the Las Vegas Strip.",

Before even stepping into the establishment, we were greeted by someone - going to guess that it was the owner/general manager. Quite an observant guy too, since he noticed my boyfriend's UWM shirt and automatically asked \"Are you a Packers fan?\" Plus he noticed how green we were to the place, so he walked us through the menu, ordering procedures, etc. Having a friendly character is a given.  I think it was the head chef that took our order too, and he wasn't kidding when he told me that his chorizo crepe was awesome. Hahaha... So glad it was a True statement 'cause it was my first savory crepe!  They have friendly regulars too! Someone gave me a recommendation from their mimosa menu. The boyfriend had a Blood Orange, and I had the Mango. Pretty good! Next time I'll be sure that the flavor profile matches the dish a lot better XD Staff was friendly the entire time, and we didn't have to wait on anyone to pick up our plates when we just wanted to talk after the meal.  Definitely going to become a regular here, especially since my boyfriend finally admitted he liked the place at the first try!",

The weekend is clearly a busy time, but our timing was perfect with less than a few minutes wait for 6 of us. We started with flights of mimosas for each of us. Then ordered our savory breakfast crepes. We added a couple sweet crepes for the table to share. My Marco Polo crepe was great. My wife's Sunday Morning crepe was equally good. All in our party thoroughly enjoyed. The staff was friendly and fun. People watching outside under the canopy was a great pastime. We all had seconds on the mimosa flights - $10 for 3 flavors beats the $13 for 1 standard on the strip!  We were in Vegas for the weekend and the trip from the strip to the restaurant and back was a $41 uber ride each way - factor that in if you don't have a car.",

I have not once been disappointed here and have brought many friends here to try it out. My dad is very picky and even he loved it when I brought him here. If you want sweet crepes they have those as well, always with fresh berries and cream or chocolate and other fresh fruits. I really loved their lattes as well as their fresh juices which they squeeze right in front of you. On the weekends this place is quite popular, so get there early or after the morning rush to get a seat. The place itself is not huge, but homey and cutely decorated. I go there all the time, and now that I live abroad I am missing it terribly! A must go if in the Henderson area for breakfast or lunch, both great choices.

    "text": "I loved this place when I first tried it but I hated the second time and I've never been back. I would have given them 4 stars the first time and 2 stars after the 2nd visit. (I can't give them 5 stars because of the mimosas)   My strongly complaint is that the food was inconsistent. The flavors were great the first time and poorly done the second time. I even tried the same dish and it didn't taste the right even though the ingredients seemed the same.  They seemed to vary the amount added to the crepe.   For me personally, the mimosa suck. I couldn't drink the trio. It's filled with artificial flavors and if you like that... it's perfect. I expected fresh juices but that's not their fault. I think you just need to be aware of it so you can decide if it's what you want.   Prices are very reasonable but they seem disorganized and need a better system for seating.   They did a great job with attention to detail... The water is flavored nicely and the worked very hard on the menu.   It has potential but I was very turned off with the second visit.  I hope to come back but for now I will wait until it improves.",

Told the wait is 20-25 minutes, got seated 45 minutes later, waited in a cramped tight hallway, sold in line again to order, got seated at where they cook and people order, people were inches away having conversations that it was hard to hold my own conversation. Waited 30 minutes for food. I literally left with a headache, not relaxing or enjoyable, way to cramped and busy!!!",

Yum. It did for sure cured our sweet tooth.   We also ordered the mimosa trio sampler. From the mango, pomegranate and passion fruit, the mango was my personal favorite but all of them were refreshing and tasted good.  Good food, excellent service, very clean. Thumbs up.",

    "text": "From the moment we walked into Crepe Expectations, I began composing a raving review in my head for yelp. As you enter, you are greeted by chalkboards announcing beverages of all kinds - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, from the usual to the unique. For example, if you're  a cream soda or root beer fan, don't miss ZeiberFizz, a combination of creamy soda and mild root beer flavor. Chimay for cheaper than they sell it at the bars in my hometown was quite attractive as well. As a mimosa fan, I should also note they have five flavors of mimosas, and for the indecisive, a mimosa trio sampler for $10.  Of course, you don't come here for the beverages, you come here for the crepes. Ahhh the crepes. Divided into an organization freak's dream, with categories for sweet, savory, or breakfast. Being that we were going out for the first meal of our day, we tried the Crepelet, the Sunday Morning, and the Berry Bliss. As strawberries aren't currently in season, I didn't mind that the strawberries were average, because everything else was absolutely amazing. You can watch the crepes being made on closed circuit television just above the ordering station. Everyone who knows crepes knows that if you can't see the pan through the dough, the crepe is too thick. The good news here is that the lady making the crepes has it down to a science, and fans the rake as if she is working on a piece of art. Crepes are, of course, art to the food world, and Crepe Expectations is equivalent to the Met in my foodie mind's eye. This experience was the first for my husband, who had never had crepes before. Halfway through the meal, he declared that we need to make these at home, so I see a visit to Williams-Sonoma in our future. It is bittersweet that we live thousands of miles away from this little gem, which is good for my waistline but disappointing that I can't partake every Sunday!",

Wife got the chorizo & egg w/ avocado (they had official names, but my old brain isn't as young as it once was). Both were fantastic. The guy that took our order (maybe the owner?) was boisterous, charming, and a little over the top - which was nice compared to the bland, expressionless zombies you'll find at most breakfast places. My 2nd favorite part (1st was the superb tastiness) of the whole experience was the big screen TV with a live feed of the griddles. From anywhere in the restaurant you can watch your crepe as it's crafted. Thanks awesome crepe dude for making our bellies so happy.",

Coffee and Water are also self serve. 3 of us went for breakfast and 2 of us ordered the Sunday Morning crepe and the other person ordered the crepe with ham & eggs. You also get a side of cottage cheese or sliced bananas with each crepe (nice touch). I loved my Sunday Morning crepe though my other guest was not that impressed with theirs. He felt there was not enough egg in the crepe and could only taste/see potatoes and cheese. Portions were large enough to fill us all up and we did not have room left over to try any of the Delicious sounding desert crepes. I will be back for those!",

When we walked in I was surprised as to how small the inside was. There are several seats outside and fortunately its west facing so morning sun would not be an issue. I had the Charizo Crepe. I was surprised of how full the packed this full of Charizo and eggs and cheese. I personally am not a crepe person but these were quite delicious. My have  made a new fan. Ones I have had in past lacked flavor and were doughy. These were thin and had great flavor. Service was quick. I wish they had fountain drinks as I wanted soda with my meal and its a one 12 ounce can serving. It would be great if one day they could expand so more people could enjoy at one time. Best way I suppose is to get food to go and take home and relax after a very filling Crepe. I will go again, and I recommend If you have not tried it to go and do so.",
