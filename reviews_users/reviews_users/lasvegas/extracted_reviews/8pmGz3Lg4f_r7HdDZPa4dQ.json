If you ever order delivery from them, expect at the very least an hour and a half wait, and god forbid you call and ask where your food is without getting a snarky remark from the delivery guy, asking if you're dying of starvation. Um, I just spent $25+ on food AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO. Of course I want to know where it is!",

    "text": "This is no mass produced, $5 plastic pizza place. This is pizza made by artisans. Pizza that tastes like real food. The crust tastes like a freshly baked Italian loaf - a soft center and crispy crust. Cheese that tastes like real cheese and stretches when you bite into it. And speaking of stretching, when I order a thick crust Sicilian, I have to order it two hours early so Vinny can stretch the dough. And I'm fine with waiting the two hours. When you think about it, it takes 6 months to get your Rolls Royce after you order it. Needless to say, this is my #1 pizza shop.",

If you love real pizza, this is the place. [And the price is fair!(Not your commercial, cheap, cheesy pizza place) no pun intended] I can't enjoy pizza from anywhere else.. I'm not a big toppings guy.. dough, cheese and sauce Are the foundation of any great pizza pie! As are for great Italian food! Yet to try other dishes, because I haven't gotten over the cheese pizza thus far. But my motto is: if the pizzas good, the rest will be also! Atmosphere is like the classic spots in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan. .not the hangout spot but where you go to get great pizza. 2 thumbs up! !",

I called grubhub and they called the restaurant and they did nothing to \"fix\" this situation which shows their apathy for their customers. I know the food that was missing was just \"sides\" but it is a substantial amount of food...

    "text": "In my last review I said last chance for romance for Vinnie. Well I became a sucker again.  Ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and mozzarella garlic bread for delivery to my office. Asked for extra extra parmesan and some red pepper flakes. Decided to call directly instead of place an order through grub hub or yelp because I figured it would be quicker. Get my order placed with the guy on the phone and he gives me a price, $21 and change including delivery fee and tax, no tip. I said \"WHAAAAT\". The numbers were not adding up to the prices on yelp, grub hub, or their website. Should have been around $17. He said \"oh we raised our prices and haven't gotten around to changing them\". Spaghetti with meat sauce from 9.99 to 11.99, 20%!!, Garlic Bread with Mozzarella from $3.49 to 3.79, Delivery Fee from $2.25 to $3.00. I said that's not good. You really should not advertise incorrect prices. Decided to place the order anyway as I was starving and did not want to go through the hassle of ordering somewhere else. Delivery arrives promptly and I am ready to dig in.... Open up the bag, pull out the spaghetti, pull out the salad, and pull out the bread. See salad dressing sitting in the bottom of the bag, that's it. No Parmesan, no red pepper flakes and no fricken' fork. Had no fork or anything else at my office so I was left eating my spaghetti with my fingers, sans parmesan, sans red pepper flakes. Food was good enough but the other missteps, (considering the missteps on my only other 2 orders) warrants a big fat ONE.  Vinnie knows better than to change prices in store without changing advertised prices. I have no doubt this is a calculated bait and switch. Businesses that practice this should not be patronized.",

Per usual, I scoped out a place on Yelp and when saw the reviews I knew that's where I was spending lunch.   The reviews weren't wrong. Recently reviewed as a best of Vegas in the LVRJ this place didn't disappoint. The service was friendly, quick, and helpful. The garlic knots were great. We went with pepperoni and meat lovers and would order both again. They were visibly appealing and delicious! A perfect combination in a pizza place.   I would definitely come back here and eat again. Let's hope they add a section so that people can eat inside so that more people traveling by can enjoy.",

It is a nice little place, and I had no expectations, I just wanted pizza. The owner was really nice and I asked for the specials, which were great. I got my pizza to go and drove away. OH MY GOD the first bite was super yummy ! Definitely going back again :3",

We ordered and waited and while we waited he gave us a slice of cheese pizza to sample as it was my first visit. It was yummy! I can't wait to taste my gyro! I'll post more later!! Well, Payless Pizza delivered! The gyro was very good! Fries were nice and hot and a good helping.  Highly recommend!",

Still well worth it! Def having this again!!!!",

Wings were crispy and the sauce was delicious. It wasn't over overwhelming it was just right. The pizza was next and I was floored. So delicious. They made us feel at home and a part of their family.

Anyway, we looked at Yelp for something nearby and saw this restaurant. I thought NY style pizza (and ribs) and 4.5 to 5 stars- I'll try it! When we arrived, I looked at the small restaurant and thought \"is this the right place?\"  Anyway we tried it and I am soooo glad we did - awesome pizza and great ribs! We had the meat lovers pizza which is incredible! The ribs are fall off the bone tender with a great homemade sauce. Vinny the owner, makes the place a hoot to visit. He goes out of his way to make you feel like family and he's got a great little restaurant with awesome food. You can tell he takes great pride in his business and cooking!

    "text": "Rude service!  Called in for delivery for my co-workers and I. We finally found a new place that would deliver to us. However,  whoever answered the phone (I wish I got his name) was completely rude. I told him before I ordered that this will be 3 separate orders (2 co-worker meals and mine) He went ahead and took my order. In the middle of taking my order I assume there was another phone call (heard a phone ringing in the back) he did not say 'please hold' but me on hold which sounded like he hung up the phone (I ended up looking at my phone to make sure he didn't). A few seconds later I heard him clicked back in and he asked for payment.  I told him 2 orders will be paying with CC and 1 with cash.  After taking the CC numbers   he said 'THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN WE DON'T SEPARATE ORDERS!'. (in a very annoyed tone)   I repeated what he said 'You don't separate orders?'   him: 'YES, BECAUSE I HAD ANOTHER CALL ON THE LINE AND NOW I MISSED THAT ORDER BECAUSE I HAD TO INPUT ALL THESE CC NUMBERS'.  I  would have been fine if he told me that from the beginning (I would have taken my services else where but they wouldn't have gotten a bad review).  If he doesn't want to separate orders then that his prerogative I guess but don't catch an attitude and come up with an ridiculous reason on why you don't separate orders when it was the first thing I said.  I was then about to cancel my order but decided to keep it since I was really hungry and didn't want to search for another place.  He was to rude to be on phone services maybe he should be put back to wash dishes.  Our order hasn't come yet but will come back and give it a fair review based off the taste & quality of the food but as for Customer Service they failed.  ------------------------------       FOOD REVIEW    --------------------------------------------------  Updated Review after receiving food  Ordered 3 meals   1) Vinnys Special Pasta  2) Rigatoni a la Vodka  3) Traditional Gyro  Overall very fresh food could tell food was made by hand. Enjoyed that everything was still hot upon arrival & Garlic Bread was still crispy (..mmmmm ..LOVED that garlic bread). You get large portions for great prices!    I would definitely eat here again.  Also greatly appreciated  Vinny for calling to checkup on the food!  Would have given 4 stars but knocked off a star for the bad phone service.",

Something about the taste of each pie just seemed off. Now we have two half eaten pizzas no one wants to finish.  We also ordered a cheesesteak with onions only to have it arrive with no onions. The Greek salad had very bland tasting Feta  Needless to say we tossed the flier  Not sure why it's called Payless, we payed almost $60 for 2 large pies, 1 cheesesteak and 1 Greek Salad",

Checked it out because of the high reviews. Turns out everyone was right! The pizza was super delicious and we had the pleasure of meeting Vinny (the owner). He was very friendly and the service was awesome. We even got a \"how to fold a pizza like a New Yorker and not like a noob\" lesson.   Would highly recommend the place! We got the garlic knots (omg, fork/knife emoji), pesto pizza (very tasty), and the Vinny's Special pizza (yum!). Eating the leftovers right now as we type and they are still appealing! Looking forward to returning again either before this trip is over or when we return in the future!  Also - we got on the wall! Haha! Yay!",

When I walked in the guy greeted me kinda rude, I said I'm here to pick up and he says I need $2.50 for tax, I was like ok ...he didn't mention that over the phone. How did he figure the tax for $2.50 when I paid $16 for the deal. I purchased a groupon for a one large topping pizza, house salad and a 2 liter soda. The pizza was very greasy and salty, didn't even need parmesan cheese that's how salty it was. The salad was bland, it came with iceberg lettuce, a few black olives, 1 slice tomato, couple red onions slices. I am not impressed with the customer service and am not coming back to this place!",

The spicy chicken strips may or may not have actually been chicken. Whatever they were did not taste good. The fries we hard and cold on the outside while still soggy from grease and steam on the inside. Hard to describe but yucky. The sandwich was soggy from steam in the container. When I picked it up the soggy bread gave away and the filling landed on the floor so I can't comment on whether the filling tasted good or not. The bread was all soggy not just in the bottom. Overall we ordered lunch for 4 people and now there are four full containers in the trash as we wait for someone else to bring us something worth eating.",

After debating a while between chicken and pizza, I got the chicken fingers' meal. SO GOOD! Decently priced, and, overall, it took about 10-15 minutes. The breading on the chicken was perfect :) and the fries were still crispy when I got home, so that's always a plus! Next time I stop by, I'll be sure to try one of their pizzas. It seems as if all of their pizza choices are hella popular, as well!",

My friend and I shared an antipasto salad and 2 slices of pizza. I was so hungry I didn't get a picture of the pizza but the salad was as delicious as if was beautiful!   The entire time we were there the owner was chatting with us and even taught me how to fold a pizza properly (The NY way) so when I go to NY later this year I don't look like a tourist. He was greeting every customer, joking with some regulars, and appreciating his staff. This place will not disappoint!",

If you get a chance to sit down and eat here instead of taking your food home or delivery , I highly recommend it. There are great family photos on the wall.   The b people make you feel welcome and like you are family.   The owner Vinny is awesome...he accommodated my sister and law, whim is a vegan and made my niece one very happy little girl.

If you love lots of fries, don't expect to get a lot of fries, with the chicken fingers or any other combos you order. So make sure to order extra fries on the side, cause in the combo meals, they don't give a lot of fries. Other than that, I truly do recommend this place and I will be ordering from them again.",

It's now 7:07 and I just got a call saying he would leave in 5 minutes however our pizza wouldn't be here for about another 20 because there's another delivery before us.... meaning our pizza that was meant to be for 630 is now maybe getting here around 730... and hour late!? Come on!!!   believe me if I paid with cash I would say forget it and not even bother going downstairs to pick it up. Unfortunately I paid with my credit card and they get paid regardless.  Let's just say I refuse to order from here again. And if you're thinking she probably won't come to Vegas again, no. I'm here several times a year.   Worst place to order delivery from!!

Driving along Tropicana with an insatiable lust for pizza in my heart, I glanced over my shoulder and saw a plain white banner draped over the side of the building with simple red letters spelling: PIZZA  A hard u-turn later I found myself heading right toward the small corner establishment with neon signs in the window advertising delivery and hot delicious pizza. With a name like \"Payless Pizza #2 and Ribs\" how could you go wrong? Walking in the place had all the marks of a great mom n' pop pizzeria: family photos, a few seats, and most importantly a massive kitchen bustling for Saturday night's order. Vinnie, the owner, manning the phone and acting as a conductor orchestrating the chaos. Genuine and cool, he took the order and showed the seating area.  The wait was small and the pizza came out hot and steaming. A recipe as Vinnie says 'took months to perfect for Vegas,' meant perfect crust for an amazing New York pizza, by far one of the best in Vegas. Tucked away in a little corner shop, a group of folks is working hard on stuffing the hearts of Las Vegas with delicious New York Pizza, the hard working folks at Payless Pizza #2 and Ribs.",

My son and husband loved it and they are very picky when it comes to food. If you're in the area I suggest you stop by and try it out!",

It was the only thing that we all ate in common. When the pizza arrived it looked BAD! I felt embarrassed to serve it to my roommates but we were all so hungry we ate it anyway. Worst mistake ever!

    "text": "After eating a strictly vegan diet for longer than anyone should, I finally cracked and gave in to my animalistic desire to devour a 16\" pepperoni with cheese. In fact, I decided to shun a life of vegan misery and instead to accept the warm, greasy embrace of my new religion by celebrating with 30 days of eating pizza at every meal. I found Payless Pizza #2 here on Yelp along with a few other joints and decided to give it a shot. Vinny has a $9.99 cash pickup special and I'll tell you what - I've paid more than double that price for pizza that wasn't even half as good. The second or third day I came in, Vinny told me with pride that he'd been called the \"Legal drug dealer of pizza\" - and I was hooked. I spent nearly $250 on pizza here over the past month, eventually giving up on the rest of the pizza joints I've been trying out. The pizza is hot, melty and just greasy enough to lubricate the heart and soul. Admittedly, I haven't tried anything besides the pepperoni but I'd be willing to bet it's all just as good. As a side note, I gained about 6 pounds of pure muscle from eating a whole pie every day while lifting. For the quality and price, you can't beat this place. Anyway, thanks for changing my life, Vinny. Keep slingin' that dough.",

I've seen it first hand throughout social media and in person, this guys just a plain old jerk to both his customers and employees. There is no need for sarcasm or to be rude to the ones that support your business who make it successful. Vinny, please begin acknowledging no one is perfect, nor is any business, but there a certain level of professionalism you should abide by.

    "text": "Where do I even start?! It was an amazing experience. It was my son's kindergarten promotion day and we were trying to find a place where we can all enjoy. The kids wanted pizza and I wanted meat not just pizza. As always, we looked up yelp and typed in pizza and saw theirs. The fact that it wasn't just pizza and they offered ribs already caught my attention. I looked into it more. Looked at all pics and looked at all reviews. Now we don't always base our decision on everyone's comments coz in the end, people still got different taste buds. Just the fact that they offered more than just pizza made our decision that much easier and since we just moved here from California a year ago, we were always looking for a new spot to try.   Got there and it was pretty small. One area to seat 4 or 5 max and the other table inside max of 3 to seat so you could imagine how tiny it is inside but why is that whenever it's tiny, it's one of the best tasting food? Anyway, there's some extra seating outside like two tables that seat 2 people. Luckily it wasn't too busy to dine in so we did. So many people kept walking in for take out. The pizza delivery guy kept walking in and out delivering pizza himself. We ordered ribs, meat lover pizza and fried chicken wings. Vinny, the owner, was the nicest guy you'd meet. He was honest and blunt. Didn't beat around the Bush and just entertained us. He wasn't shy and he was very proud of his place. He even took our picture in the end to post up on his wall with the other photos of other people that are either regulars there or famous people.   The ribs, omg he didn't lie when he said it falls off the bone. I'm telling you I've been hunting for some good ribs and my husband knows how picky I can get. We've gone to places where I regret spending money for some ribs that I could have honestly cooked myself and enjoyed more. The second it got to the table, I stuck my fork in it and the meat literally tore apart. The taste is so good! Not too strong not too light. My son, 6 year old, share the love of ribs with me and he said it's \"100 out of 10\" haha and my kids are super picky! I'm talking about picky where I can't even cook popcorn Shrimp for them coz they only like popeyes popcorn Shrimp    The chicken wings were good too just like any other chicken wings not too special. Once you dip it into Vinny house made ranch?! WOW. I've never really liked ranch but that I love! It was creamy, milky and perfect.  The pizza. Delicious! Kids loved it. We loved it. Vinny even taught us how to eat it New York style lol. It was fun. The pizza is by far my favorite when it comes to thin pizza. I wish we said extra cheese coz it wasn't as cheesy but the flavor and texture made up for it. Next time I might as super cheesy haha. I like it when the cheese strings out you know? But it was so good. Of course we couldn't finish it all so we brought it home. When you microwave it, all the food tasted the same and made me crave for more lol. We'll probably go again soon. One time we got desperate and ordered dominoes coz it was really late  can never go back to those fast made retail pizza once you taste authentic pizza made by authentic people.   I really enjoyed it here and would highly recommend this place! Just buy a piece of pizza to try if you're hesitant to buy a whole pizza. If we lived closer, he would see me once a week lol",

We ordered delivery and it took a little under an hour during the dinner rush on a Friday night.  The food arrived piping hot. I tried the Turkey,  bacon ranch sub. This was a generous sized sub. The roll was crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the outside. The bacon was cooked nice and crisp and it had a good amount of veggies on it ( I happen to love a lot of veggies on my subs). My husband had the double cheese burger and was very happy. Again the bun was fresh and he mentioned several time while eating it how juicy it was. We split an order of fries,  and I don't know how they do it but they are the only place that manages to deliver crispy hit fries. ..",

Like every other eggplant I've had. Oh was I wrong. I picked it up and the container had oil in bottom.... Thought maybe from the cheese. Nope! The eggplant was thinly sliced, then fried to almost burnt and put into the roll. Who does that?! I felt like I was eating fried vegetable skin then was left out and became soggy. When I grabbed the eggplant, you could see the oil seeping out of it. I ended up throwing away the whole sub. Extremely disappointed and waste of money. Boyfriend loves the Philly cheese steaks, but I won't be getting anything from here anymore.",

In all honesty, I've never had a pizza delivery order take that long to deliver. NEVER! And I live less than a half a mile from the pizza parlor. To top it all off the pizza arrived lukewarm like it had sat for quite a while before it was delivered and it was extremely greasy. I haven't tried the ribs yet. Hopefully they won't disappoint. 2 stars for the flavor. Not bad. Probably won't order from there again unless I'm really hard up. Too bad. They probably loose a lot of customers because of their seemingly lack of customer service.",

Onto the food the pizza was really delicious no complaints as it tasted good and tasted alot better then some of the big name pizza places. The fries were good fresh to the point where they were so hot that they almost burned my mouth and I felt that the next day True story lol. As for the chicken they were about 3 pieces or 4 2 were really big the other two were some of the smallest pieces I have ever seen like really laughably small and the meat on those pieces were hard it was decent chicken but it reminded me of that chicken you would eat at buffets probably won't order it again though as for the experience it was good and I give this place 4 stars and I plan to order pizza from then again when I get a chance again.",

This is ITALIAN-STYLE pizza!!  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and the pie was on point, there was a bit of grease but the crust was crispy so it never had a chance to fall apart as is usually the case...this crust handles it like a champ!  The cheese was perfect, stretchy but never clumpy...and the price is unbelievable, $12 and change for a 16' inch pie...I spent less than $20 for me and my family.  Vinnie even gave my son an extra piece of cheese pizza...I got a little taste of it and it is by far, one of the best cheese pizzas I ever had...I will definitely order a cheese pizza next time.  This place offers other things like wings and white pies...but also jalapeno poppers and lasagna...cheesesteaks!  So ideally this is enough for me to give a place 5 stars but the customer service here was above and beyond.  Vinny chatted with us and even had a chance to tell us that he was once a New York firefighter...plus, he gave my son a piece of pie!  Find this place on this site or GH for delivery, you will not regret ordering from here...it is even worth the trek to have what I believe is probably the best Italian-style pizza in all of LV.  Good job Vinny!  You WILL see me again before we leave town!  I need that cheese pizza...",

He was extremely friendly as well. I even upgraded my small pizza to a large just because I had such a good feeling about the place. I got my pizza and it was AWESOME. The cheese was different, something I hadn't tasted before this but I liked it very much. I got sausage on half and cheese on the other half. The sausage was also extremely good. I even liked the crust and I am not much for crust usually. I am a very picky person and this place definitely won me over. While I was in eating, another customer had come in who was also trying it for the first time and told the owner himself his pizza was great. I have to agree, this place is worth it. Not expensive at all for the quality of the food, I would recommend this place to anybody!",

Closest thing to Pizza from NY! Today we had the pasta with chicken and tomatoes on a garlic sauce, with cheese garlic bread & cannolis. Excellent! The delivery is fast & the food is always hot & fresh! Definitely the best pizza & price in town!",

Even though he was in hospice at the time, in his mind we were preparing dinner at home.   Until 2001, my family had lived in the east coast US, and so I became accustomed to a certain form of Italian American food. Few places this far west have measured up- until we found Payless Pizza.   The pies are the genuine article. The pesto pizza is amazing. The ranch, made in house, is wonderful; but don't even think about ruining a perfectly good order of Vinnie's garlic knots with it. For those, you'll want to try the equally delicious marina. Truthfully though, you can't go wrong with an item on the menu. Crafted with  real ingredients, prepared with passion, every bite is a testament to the love this place feels for authentic east coast Italian food.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.",

The dough is soft with satisfying crispness and the balance of sauce and cheese gives you a delicious and lubricious (grease - which is a MUST for NY style pizza) experience!!! I would have posted a photo, but consuming the pizza was more important while hot. My apologies. ;) Their menu is vast, so don't be afraid to order a bit of everything. Lastly, the cannoli ... try them! #bomb #dinnermicdrop",

The food was promptly delivered hot & fresh, exactly as ordered. The white basil pizza is amazing!!! Yum! The pizza was very tasty, even the crust was delicious! We usually never finish our pizza from other \"commercialized\" places, but we ate every bite of this pizza!! We ordered the Tiramisu for desert.... it was sooo good! I recommend this food highly! We will definitely be eating here in our future pizza orders! Thank you Payless pizza! You guys rock!",

PLUS, this business participates in the Yelp Cash Back program with 10% Cash Back on your purchase (just link your Credit or Debit card to Yelp, pay with that card through Yelp, and you earn cash back automatically). I ordered the XL Meat Lover's Pizza and it was $18.99. For delivery, you have to have a minimum order of $20, so I added the Antipasto Salad since Yelp wouldn't let me check out due to not spending $20. The pizza was delivered EARLIER than expected. I actually ordered this for my husband and kids, as I had a mixer to attend. When I came home, they left me a slice and told me that the pizza was really good! I didn't really get to experience it fresh, but even a bit cold it was tasty and we all loved the crust! I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food got to me early, the pizza was tasty, the crust was good, they participate in the Yelp Cash Back program which means I get at least $3 back, their menu is pretty extensive with Cold & Hot Subs, Pasta, Salads, Burgers, Ribs, Fried Chicken, and so much more. Honestly there wasn't anything to complain about! Nothing negative to deduct a star! How long has this place been here??? I did a search on Yelp for pizza delivery near me and yesterday was the first time I heard about this place. I have tried so many different pizza joints, but most were disappointments. While my husband loves Carmine's Pizza, I don't. Payless Pizza is good and costs less than Carmine's for an XL which helps ME feed a family of 4! And, I don't know who Vinny is but I am so very sorry for his loss :(",

Not super ideal. I was a little pissed until I saw the delivery guy who was super friendly and I smelled the food.  Sometimes, even if the start of the meal is frustrating, the end result can be such a delicious meal that you forget everything else. I got the ravioli with meatballs and my husband got chicken fingers with a side of cheesy garlic bread. The portion sizes were massive, and they all tasted so great.

Pizza: 100 times better than the first time. Was delivered warm and had a great amount of toppings.   Sub: Was actually very good. Would probably stick with the subs if I were to ever order from here again.   My only complaint is that when Vinny delivered the food he wanted to charge us. I have no problem paying for a pizza I want, but after that first time we would have never ordered from here again if it wasn't for Vinny insisting on making it up to us. So yes, I was very surprised that he told us the total. I mentioned that I thought this was on the house because of the first time and him reaching out all week. He agreed. He did take our $10 tip.   I've had family in town the last few days and haven't had time to hop on yelp and update the first review. Thankfully Vinny has reminded me twice and the last time with a message informing me that I haven't followed up with my end of the deal. Insinuating that I was one of the people that are only in it for the free food. Which is funny since he wasn't' even offering us free food.   Thanks for that message. You have just lost a customer.   So for those who choose to eat here: I would recommend picking it up and sticking with the subs.   Best of luck with Payless Pizza and Ribs Vinny.",

Upon entry, we wait a moment as they're taking an order with another customer. We notice a few pieces of artwork on the walls that give off these NYC vibes. We order the #3 Payless Pizza from the menu and it took about 15 minutes. We're handed a huge pizza box that covers a good portion of our 2 person table outside. You open the box and there it is... a traditional NY style pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage, onion, peppers and more. Vinny, the owner, is very welcoming and accommodating. He even took a little bit of his time to talk to us about pizza and traveling. Pretty awesome! Overall, the experience at Payless Pizza #2 was worth it!!",

    "text": "Staying in Las Vegas for a week without a car.   So i yelped all the places that will deliver food to my hotel.  My kids of course love pizza so this place was a must try since it got good reviews.  After trying to use eat24 and not having any luck, I just called and placed my order.  I first asked if I could get the $5/55 discount they offer when placing through the app since I wasn't able to use the app and the guy said he will have to see based on what I ordered.  The ordering process took awhile because he had a hard time hearing my order and I was put on hold for a bit while they ran my credit card. I ordered a x large pepporronni pizza, 1 full rack of ribs, 1 cheese steak sandwhich,  1 spaghetti and meatballs, 2 sides of ranch and sodas.  All that for my husband and 3 little kids.  I wanted to order extra just so we can have leftovers the next day. Our order arrived in an hour, they called me 10 minutes early to let me know the driver is on their way.  That gave me time to walk to the lobby and meet him.  Driver was friendly.   The receipt he gave me was just a written list of the items I ordered,  no price or total, so no way of knowing if he gave me the $5 discount.  Only total was from the credit card receipt.  Going to restaurants I always prefer an itemized receipt so I know exactly what they charge me for, because mistakes can happen.  My total bill was $75, but through the app it showed my total as $67.39 for all the exact items I ordered with the tax and discount included. So not sure if they overcharged me since once again, there was no itemized receipt. Or if he even gave me the discount like he said he did.  So I wasn't too happy about the total. Well back to the food.  The pizza was yummy.  It wasn't piping hot, just warm, but still good.  I can imagine it tasting much better fresh hot out of the oven.  The ribs were tender.  I prefer my ribs extra saucy, but these ribs had just a glaze of bbq sauce over it. The Philly cheese steak was good.  The meat very flavorful.  The bread just a bit dry.  We didn't eat the spaghetti, but I did take just a bite to try it.  It was ok to me.  The sauce is a bit on the tarty side.  But i like the fact they use the thin spaghetti noodles.  We finished most of the pizza with only 2 slices left.  That's breakfast for the kids.   Still have pretty much have the whole rack of ribs left.  So that's all leftover lunch for us.  I would probably order from here again, just for the pizza alone.  But i would double check carefully on what they are charging.",

You can tell from the smell of the garlic and the pizza spices we were in for a real treat.  The menu was very extensive and right off the bat we were told that they have everything except Asian or Mexican food. I had ribs and fried chicken which was excellent and My wife had a signature sandwich which was great. Really want to try there pizza.  Give this place a 5 star because it's authentic Brooklyn style food and real down to earth people.",

The food is good old fashioned mom & pop pizzeria. We had the baby back rib dinner and a an xl meat lovers. Both were solid. The pizza was huge, the sauce to die for and as a cheese lover I wasn't left wanting for cheese. The pizza brought back memories of pizza I had many years ago when I first moved to the US. The ribs fells off the bone, just as baby backs should.  Had time to talk to the owner whilst waiting for our order, he is new to the business and definitely committed to providing a quality experience and value for money. His enthusiasm alone had me rooting for him and that was before I got to sample the fare.  Don't judge a book by it's cover nor a restaurant by it's exterior.",

    "text": "--- Update to reply to Vin K (Business Owner), for the benefit of other Yelpers who are reading this review, so you get the full story:  Let me call out the statement of \"There's nowhere to park\".  This was the Juhl apartment building in downtown where there is street parking surrounding the entire block of the apartment. If your driver can supposedly park and go to the front desk, he can park on the 3rd street, the street I had instructed you to go to, where there were plenty of empty spaces, and meet me at my apartment street door on the ground floor that faces that 3rd street.  I've been getting food delivery 3-4 times a week for the past 2 years that I lived at the Juhl, no other pizza store, or any of the other dozens of restaurants that I've had deliveries from, has _ever_ asked me to go to the front desk to pick up my delivery. So yeah, you deserve less than 1 star.  As for \"it's against our policy to deliver down there\", if this were True, you wouldn't have called to try to negotiate to have your driver meet me at the front desk. You would have called to tell me that you don't actually deliver downtown.  ---- Original review: For a $6 delivery fee, you would think they will bring it to your apartment door, but nope, they insist on you going to the front desk (which is on the other side of a very large apartment building) to pick up your pizza.  Even after telling them my apartment is on the ground floor and accessible directly from the street, where there is parking (I can see empty spaces from my window as I type this review), they didn't want to come to my door.  In summary: Don't order delivery if you live in an apartment building.",

    "text": "I've recently moved to the West Tropicana area, and I just wanted to drop a few lines to say thanks to Vinny and the crew at Payless Pizza #2 and Ribs for consistently going out of their way to make sure I'm happy! The food is super tasty, the ingredients are quality, and the prices are VERY reasonable! Whether you're in the mood for Pizza, BBQ/Roasted Chicken, Fried Fish/Fried Chicken, or Burgers. Payless Pizza #2 and Ribs is by far the best in The West Trop area! Also, lookout for Vinny's Combo Meals!! Here's just a few: Chicken and Ribs, Fried Chicken and Ribs, Fried Fish and Ribs, and Fried Fish and Fried Chicken. All of these come with Fries, and a side dish.  Also, if you really want to try something different, and you like things like Collard Greens and Kale. Tell Vinny to add a side of Broccoli Rabe (Rapini) to your order. It's seasoned right, garlicky, and just a little spicy. I order it every time I'm there!",

Its like $7 or $8 for a large, or you can get 2 slices and a drink for less than $5. I've also had their meatball sub and a few other sandwiches and they have all been delicious. My kid loves the plain cheese pizza its definitely his favorite, we both love the thin, crispy, fold-able crust. I have to try the ribs next time because we always get the pizza because its so good.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews thought I'd try this pizza place as we were tired from the long day we spent in Vegas! Let me start by stating I have eaten at Mesa Grill, Olives, Michael Mina, Bur Bar, Gordon Ramsay BurGR and Aureole! I was looking forward to just having some good pizza! Reviews were good.  We did order delivery but our hotel was only 11mins away from the store. I wasn't going to take a cab to pickup my order.  Well after 1 1/2hrs later I called and was informed that the person was glad I called and confirmed my call back number.  He called and said he'd call back once his driver was leaving...he called and I waited in the vallet for 20 minutes.  So delivery took over 2 hours after I placed my order...grrrrr!  So we ordered the 18\" the payless pizza supreme and garlic knots.  Well the pizza was lukewarm but the flavor was good and crust was thin but was soggy from sitting too long before being delivered! The garlic knots, I'm not sure what the rave was about these things as they just seemed to be pieces of dough in butter not much flavor!  All and all not sure if this is a good delivery option while you're in Vegas at all!!  Maybe for pick up it would have been better.  I expected more for $35.75 US dollars by the way for pizza.",

CONS: - Upon ordering, owner said the sign of good pizza was \"When the grease drips down your arm\" which luckily didn't happen but was totally a turnoff. - The pizza was kind of lackluster and didn't have much flavor. Crust had good chew, Pepperoni and mushroom toppings were good but cheese and sauce were bland.  - They don't really market themselves as an NY style spot but the decor is all NY themed and frankly this spot under delivers when I'm expecting a NY slice. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back but would try something else on the menu.",

The garlic knots were the best we had. We ate the pizza before we could take a picture  ;)   We also tried their cannoli for dessert which was great too.  Would recommend this place to all good food lovers.  They have a couple of tables to dine-in, they seem to deliver as well.

    "text": "Vinny does New York pizza the right way at Payless, and it's my go-to pizza place when that's the style I crave.   Life Pro-Tip: When a New Yorker says something, they're probably not playing around. The door says \"the grease will run down your arm!\" That's not a playful slogan - it's True. A little too True at times: If you're not careful carrying the box perfectly level on your way out, the cheese will slide off onto one side of the pie. Just be careful, and you'll be fine. You'll want to be careful with it anyway, considering how good it is.   Payless doesn't cut corners with cheap cheese, which is the reason behind the grease. No, that's not vegetable oil or something -- that's flavor. Pat it down if you want to, just understand that you aren't eating at Sbarro. The 'grease' here isn't liquified cardboard like you'll find at many, many other shops around town. The pickup special is priced for cash only for this reason: with a card transaction, the shop won't make enough margin. It may not be the kind of pizza you want every time you have a craving, but it more than satisfies the desire for that classic New York foldable slice. My only legitimate gripe is the shop is closed on Sundays. That might be coming from a writer spoiled by the 24/7 nature of Las Vegas, but during football season, this is a huge deal -- and, quite honestly -- seems like a missed opportunity on the owner's part.   And while the space itself may not lend itself to a night out, sit-down experience, picking up food isn't a problem and is always made on time. In fact, you'll get a call if it sits too long, as Vinny wants to make sure the food is as fresh, hot and tasty enough to due the ingredients he uses justice. And, well, so you'll be happy. And you will be, even if you choose something else on the menu. There are many other options aside from pizza, and I've never had something I regretted ordering, from cheesesteaks, to ribs, and cannoli.   When you enter, you'll never see Vinny sitting still. He works hard because he cares about his customers and his food. It may be a small operation, but his food is always in demand and his diligence toward quality is the obvious reason why.",

Zucchini rounds were crispy and flavorful (obviously these rounds had never even heard of a freezer let alone been inside one. The garlic knots (the house specialty) are bite size, fresh baked bread served with herbed garlic butter for dipping. The flavor is indescribable but worth driving several hundred miles to get an order.  The pizza and sandwiches were equally spectacular. The real treat, however, was Vinny    himself. Promises you the tim spent at his will be a trip to Brooklyn and he delivers. Vegas is a city of simulations and copies but Payless Pizza is an authentic treat.",

We ordered just a plain cheese, and an order of garlic knots, and they were both legitimately decent. The best I've ever had? No, but above average, and even better than most other delivery joints in the area.   The dough was nice, chewy and fold-able and the sauce and cheese were pretty on point. The garlic knots are a lot smaller than what I'm used to, but were still equally delicious and drenched in garlic butter.   The delivery time I was quoted was also correct if not on the dot.   Again, a nice place to order carry out when in Vegas. Sometimes you're too tired to go out, or just want to party at the hotel and this place hits the spot.",

The male pizza employee said that the website is a fraud and they don't have my order (checked by address). But then he asked if my name was Melanie...HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?? He admitted that they received a fax with the order information - why wouldn't you have called me then instead of letting me wait 45m for a pizza that was not coming?!  \"We didn't build that website and we don't receive the money. You need to call your credit card company to report it.\" Later, I received an email saying the restaurant cancelled my order. I called again and spoke to female employee. She gave same story that the website wasn't built by them and they don't know where the money goes when the order says \"prepaid.\"  Now that I have cancelled my credit card and found another way to eat... I believe the restaurant is causing alarm for the wrong reasons. If the website was phishing for credit cards then why would it alert the intended recipient every time? Also why would the alleged thief then voluntarily refund the pending transaction? Seems like the restaurant isn't savvy enough to know the money goes into their bank or merchant account. Never again will I order from Payless Pizza.",

The menus variety is great if your not just wanting pizza even though his pizza is the best! Anyways I'm writing this review now because I got locked out of my car right in from the Payless Pizza when I was picking up an order(Double Bacon Cheeseburger). I also got lucky because there was a mess up in a order and he gave me a whole pizza for 5 bucks,  and I told Vinny about me getting locked out and he decided to come out and help me even though he had customers in and orders to make. We were out there for like an hour trying to get in when we just finally called a Locksmith. So while I waited I sat and ate my burger and fries! Overall more of the story great place , great people, great food ! Check them out !",

I ordered an extra large with extra cheese and some cheese fries at 11:10am and exactly 30 minutes later Vinny (cool cat) was at my door. Damn. I expected at least a 50 min wait, so kudos.  Being from The Bronx I was missing or better yet fiending for New York Style pizza and Payless Pizza #2 didn't disappoint. The pizza was thin, foldable and cheesy with the prerequisite oil dripping down my chin. Not only was it delicious, it brought back memories.

My expectations were high after meeting and getting to know Vinny because he is a very hard nosed old school Brooklyn food man, who is not afraid to tell you to wait because his food is made fresh and right and that takes time. Pizza is served well done with the right synthesis of quality traditional ingredients. I have had his wings served well done with a delicious house Ranch and hot sauce! Excellent flavor's. My favorite item is Vinnys Philly Cheesesteak with Mushrooms & Peppers melted over with Mozzarella ! The meat was delicious and there was about 3/4 of a pound of it.  If you know good food Vinny will take care of you. He's a real New Yorker that cares about you and what you think   Just for the record I went back for more every time I go it gets stronger! Chicken Parm with roasted peppers extra -sauce delicious . The bread is warm slightly crunchy . Any time you feel like authentic New York Italian food Vinnys Is a whole in the wall that will keep you craving his rich flavorful classics!

No one called our phone number to mention they were running late and when it finally did arrive to our complex, they had our front office call us instead of doing it themselves. Everything was cold and there was no cocktail sauce for the shrimp (which are fried, not cocktail shrimp, btw).   After we reheated everything, tasted awesome. Fresh, yummy cheese and great breading on the apps. The zucchini are coins, not strips (yay!). Disappointed with timing and coldness due to the high reviews. Maybe we caught them on an off day.",

They have a broad menu and affordable prices.  The crew working was very friendly as well.    After seeing pictures on yelp, I was sold, and the pizzas I tried were amazing!  The only one drawback was the crust on the edge wasn't as great as the rest of the pizza.  The buffalo chicken pizza was awesome, the flavors blended together well.  The other pizza - the deli- sauce was absolutely phenomenal.  It was among the best I've had.  The cheese and toppings were blended perfectly and the best thin crust anywhere!  Again on the end the crust was a bit off from the rest but it definitely didn't detract from the overall experience.    A great place to try, and I'll definitely return!",

    "text": "Good for a $9.99 special. Large 16\" with pepperoni take out was our order. Pictures are 15 minutes after we picked it up, and drove back to aria.   Again, everything was above average for a $9.99 pie. It's not a New York pizza for sure. Maybe New York style, but the oil and water seems off. The dough was much like the 7-11 style. Biscuit taste to it. The sauce was canned, or at least tasted like it. It had little flavor. Funny enough, it all kinda came together as an ok pie, and as I said, above average for $9.99 which is why 4 stars.   For those of you from New York, any Ray's has better than this, but again this is factoring in value too.   Just a note as I look at what pictures I posted; previous reviews mentioned not rotating the pie while cooking. Judging by the bottom and the cheese, the \"noobs\" have figured that out.",

The other owner kicked out all the old staff and has replaced them with noobs. They don't know how to make a pizza - half of it was burnt/half was undercooked because they didn't understand that revolutionary concept of rotating it while cooking.  Additionally, the recipe isn't the same at all. The crust is different, the sauce is now exceptionally bland, and the cheese is incredibly cheap.   Just completely horrible compared to where it was. If you have the choice your better off with pizza hut.",

We called an hour and half later, and when we asked them about the status of our pizza the owner said that the pizza wasn't ready, and would take at least 30 to 40 more minutes. The guy wasnt even apologetic about it, and told us to pick up the pizza up ourselves!!  For obvious reasons we cancelled the order, and left a negative review of this disgraceful dump. As soon as my friends and I left a detailed description of the events that transpired, the OWNER, Vinny, had the balls to call our cell phones and started threatening us for our bad review. I'm reporting this place to yelp, and will be attaching how he responded to my friend with a profanity laced rant. I hope this pathetic establishment burns to the ground.",

When we moved to the area almost 4 years ago we'd still go to generic chains at first but once we realized it was there and tried them we haven't gone back to those generic chains again.   We love our pepperoni and mushroom pizza, usually a large, love there leftovers. But they have alot more to offer, everything from salads, cold subs, hot subs, burgers with fries, chicken fried and roasted, yummy cheese steaks, some good cannoli's to name a few things. For such a small place you wouldn't expect them to have so many options. But everything is freshly made to order.   They have two tables inside and two bench style tables outside. The only bummer is, especially during football season, they are not open on Sundays. Never asked why. But just be prepared. Also they do have delivery but definitely a good discount if you pay cash and pick up. Don't forget to tip them for all their hard work and yummy eats.",

And to compare, I've had actual cheesesteaks in Philly (D'Alessandro's, Geno's, etc.) and this was absolutely nothing close. There was barely any meat in it. Only thing that made it decent was the bread. In addition, the fries were soggy. I'm not sure if it was the time estimate that Yelp provided but the fries and food weren't fresh.

That means most of the room is filled with Vinny's awesome personality! He noticed right away that we were newcomers and tourists (I guess I clearly don't look like a New Yorker), yet he was very polite and welcoming, running through the menu for us. They have everything from pastas to wings to ribs and of course, pizza!  We ordered a large (16\") #3 - the Payless special pizza. The pie had sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bell peppers! It was cut into 8 slices and each one was so full of flavor, and the cheese was really gooey without sliding off the pizza like some other places.  Vinny had given us a warning that the pizza is going to be pretty greasy -- just like the way it is in New York! It actually wasn't as greasy as I thought it would be, no pool of grease on the plate or anything. Vinny even went as far as to bring out another slice of pizza to show us how to fold a slice the way they do it in New York!  We also got an order of ribs and hot wings. The ribs were so amazingly tender and you can really see why they've won multiple awards in BBQ states like Tennesse. The barbeque sauce he makes in house is also the perfect combo of sweet, salty, and smoky! I don't know if ribs are a big thing in Italy, but Vinny has definitely mastered the craft and it's awesome.  The chicken wings are perfectly fried to the point where the skin is crispy but the inside is hot and tender and just fall off the bone. The sauce doesn't really have any heat, next time I'd probably just get BBQ so I can have more of that sauce!  We don't eat a lot of pizza in general, but if all pizzas were like this, I would definitely eat a lot more. Not only is the food great, but Vinny has an awesome personality and makes dining here a great time!",

After we saw the variety and pictures we decided to go with cheesesteak sandwiches (with onion, mushroom and bell pepper), salad and garlic knots. My brother-in-law came along and they ordered a large meat pizza. Vinny (the owner) and the guys working tonight we're very friendly and helpful. We got back to our timeshare and everyone started eating- the food was very warm/hot and fabulous! There was complete silence, other than a few \"mmm's\" for a few minutes. I would highly recommend food from here. They have a few tables you could eat at, a mini mart just around the side of the building for adult beverages...and did I mention the food was still piping hot when we got back to our place? We went back for pizza three nights later, this time we ordered the Payless Special and a cheese pizza for the kids. Both pizzas were scrumptious and my son, who normally just eats cheese had some of the Payless Special, said it was so yummy he wanted seconds!  Everything we've had from Vinny's Payless Pizza has been fabulous! Highly recommend!",

I even asked you to send driver back to refund my money and you said ok. on top of telling me I'm gonna leave a bad review so you hung up on me so unprofessional. paying almost $60.00 for 2 pizza and to be treated like crap. wow I'll make sure all my friends know about this place and where not to order from when going to vegas. Sad how the owner treats customers",

This place offers a very extensive menu that includes NY style pizza, pasta, hot and cold sub, BBQ chicken and rib, salad, etc. The service is AAA+, the food tastes great with reasonable prices. I think we have found our favourite pizza joint.",

Vinny made us feel welcomed and gave us the history of him coming to Vegas from Brooklyn (where he owned a pizza shop) and how he perfected his crust recipe to be better than before.   We ordered the Basil Pesto and meat lovers. Took an average amount of time for them to come out to the table, and when they came we were rewarded with two incredible pies. The basil pesto was the better of the two, but the star of the show was Vinny's crust which was one of the best crusts I've ever had, easily the best New York style crust I've ever had. The texture and flavour were both perfectly balanced and I kept eating until I was on the verge of purging, something I almost never do.   Overall, Vinny made incredible pizza at an incredible price. This definitely will become a tradition each time I come out to Vegas, and as a pizza fanatic I'll surely have dreams about the flavourful basil pesto on that perfect crust.",

My family is also born and raised in NYC so trust me, we know the difference between good and bad pizza. I love the sauce, the fresh ingredients and the love put into each pizza. I work for a company that orders from Payless Pizza #2 regularly and were at one time greeted by the owner on a delivery who took the time to ask us what we thought about his pizza and was open to any suggestions we could provide. Refreshing to see someone that cared this much! Not enough of it these days and we appreciated it very much. I wanted to take the time to share this as, I know personally how challenging it can be at times to be a small business owner. Thank you for the excellent customer service and the great food! Now, if you could only make a pizza that made me skinny...LOVE you guys!",

However, after being told that I need to pay an additional $5.00 delivery charge because Vinny and his drivers don't want to wait the 1-2 minutes for Security at the front gate of my community to call me to let them in, that turned me off. I used to order from them constantly and when I tried to compromise with them by saying that I would tell Security to let them in once they gave my name and address and would no longer need to wait to call, it was still not good enough. Vinny insisted that I somehow convince Security to let him in when he says he is the Payless Pizza guy without giving a name, address or location inside the community he is going.  Essentially, Vinny expects them to just let him in without them knowing where he is going. What's the point of having Security if they are just letting everyone in, it's the entire principal of their profession.  Like I said, food is great. Trying to hustle me for 5 bucks, I will find somewhere else that has good food at this point.",

My 18 yr old daughter and my husband ordered the Chicken Cordon Blue on rigatoni noodles with Alfredo sauce.  These meals were mega size for the price. One serving could easily feed two adults.  Both of them enjoyed their meals but were stuffed to the gils and couldn't finish (the Chicken was HUGE). My other 18 year old is a spaghetti marinara fanatic.  She said it was the best she's had and managed to finish the entire serving......probably because she hadn't eaten all day.  I had the lasagna and it was also good.  Not sure what they put in their meat sauce but is was very tasty.  Again, the serving was massive and I couldn't finish.    We feel like we just finished last in the food Olympics!  So stuffed!

A few in, I was sold and made my order. I'm from New Jersey and take my pizza seriously. I've spent 16 years in Los Angeles and what they call pizza is a sacrilege.   I went to pick up my order and found myself transported back to my childhood in Jersey where once a week we'd pick up our pepperoni pizza at our local pizza place. I was greeted like I was an old friend even though it was my first time there. There was even a guy from Jersey sitting down eating pizza when I arrived. I was shown the pizza and I KNEW I was in the right place. I actually had to put it in the trunk to keep from grabbing a slice to eat on the way home. The scent still drove me nuts, though. lol  If you're from NJ/NY and miss the pizza you know and love, come here. You don't have to tell them anything; they know what to do. I will be a weekly customer.",

They were voted best of for NY pizza and deservedly so.  They are pretty busy taking phone orders but a little patience is worth it.  Give them a try they are worth it.  My only complaint and it's not really a complaint is that the name of the place is a little wierd and made me think it wasn't going to be a good place.  But it is and we we're back the next week...",

We enter and this guy comes out and says,\"Wadda you want pizza or what???\" it was the owner Vinny, classic New York attitude made us feel right at home, Pops ordered the roast chicken - best he ever had, Cuz had some fried chicken he said this stuff is great both of them together the fries is BOMB, Ribs were delish, and when the Buffalo Chicken Pizza arrived - took several bites let it sink in - Then I heard the ANGELS sing\"AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH\" DANG this is the best slices i've ever ate, thin light crispy and chewy not at all greasy, OMG the wing sauce, flavors were off the chain, 2 Dr. Peppers later, I was in heaven.

We were greeted so very nicely by Vinny and his staff. We ordered food to go but while waiting we had a couple of slices and garlic knots. The pizza is very good and is a True New York style pizza. The garlic knots were very good too, I especially loved the sauce that came with them.  To go we ordered chicken parm sub, spaghetti and meatballs, house salad with ranch dressing and two cannolis.   My salad was fresh, crisp and delicious. I was told the ranch dressing is homemade and it was excellent! The spaghetti and meatballs was very good and a very good sized portion. The meatballs were tender and flavorful. My husband said his chicken parm sub was \"excellent\" and this is a very rare response from him! The cannolis were fresh and delicious Yum! I must mention the to go packaging was done right. Everything was secure and properly packaged (so important!).  it was well over 40 minutes by the time we got our food home but the food stayed piping hot! The bread from the hot sub did not turn soggy and was still fresh and held up nicely thanks to the packaging, quite impressive! The menu is very appealing and extensive and there is something for everyone; pizza, pasta dinners, hot and cold subs, fried chicken, chicken wings, ribs, burgers, salads, desserts and so much more. I look forward to returning to try more items from the menu and thanks Vinny for great conversation and great food!",

I don't like thick crust because it fills me too fast so was surprised that the crust is perfect.  Get a cup of sauce to dunk crust.  I got a veggie pizza with sausage.  All the veggies tasted fresh and flavorful. The sausage did not have the Chicago flavor but was very good. The entire staff is very friendly and made us feel comfortable immediately.  There is limited seating inside and outside.  I plan to go back to get their 4X prize winning ribs then I have to try their pasta.  The prices are reasonable especially because of the great quality and large portions they serve.  Highly recommend trying this pizza joint!",

We looked at the reviews and were hopeful, but as an ex New Yorker I will say THIS is the real deal!! Not just the food... which ROCKS!! But Vinnie just made the experience for us. We had the pizza and philly steaks. Both were awesome. And the fries... extra crispy (just how we like them) with a great house seasoning!! I really don't think you could go wrong with anything on this menu. It's clear there is love in all the dishes here. As a former New Yorker, and chef in New York, this place has my stamp of approval!!",

    "text": "I would've liked to have been able to review Payless Pizza...But I never got the chance to try them.   About 90 minutes ago, I went on GrubHub, saw that Payless was very close by, and they offered delivery. I'm new in town, don't have a car yet, and I'm staying with a friend who lives literally across the street from this place. So when I ordered a 16\" Meat Lover's pie for delivery at 8pm, I figured it'd be quick.   I was a little disappointed when GrubHub said the order would show up no later than an hour and 10 minutes from then, but oh, well. I kept my phone right next to me with the ringer up on case there were any problems.   Then, I waited.   Imagine my surprise when at exactly nine-oh-nine...with ONE MINUTE to spare - I got an email saying that my order had been cancelled, and my money refunded. Why? Because Payless had evidently had \"a question,\" and they \"couldn't reach me to ask it.\" Now, remember, the driveway to their parking lot is exactly across the street from the complex where I'm staying. The pizza in question is right there on the menu, and I ordered it as-is...no special requests or substitutions. I had my phone on an end table next to me listening for a ring in case of problems. And I got the message with only A MINUTE TO SPARE that my nearly $25.00 order (including pre-paid 20% tip!) was not going to be coming after all.   So, I borrowed my roommate's car, and now I'm angrily eating Chinese food at a place up the road. All because the staff at Payless are apparently too incompetent to deliver what would have been a $25.00 order ACROSS THE STREET...But also so lax on customer service that they waited until LITERALLY THE LAST MINUTE to tell me as much!  To be honest, I'm actually kind of impressed. That's a SPECIAL level of incompetence. So, bravo, Payless Pizza. You've shown me a new low in ball-dropping.  EDIT: Just double-checked the phone number and address I gave GrubHub (since \"Vin\" seems keen to point fingers and pin his failure on others rather than own up and apologize), and both are correct.   In a world of GPS and Google Maps, the fact remains that Payless would rather blame anyone else but themselves (and try to get you to believe that I don't even know EITHER my own address OR phone number) rather than acknowledge their apparent inability to deliver a pizza to an address less than a quarter of a mile away.   Go ahead, Payless. Blame the customer. See how that works out for you.",

The delivery guy wasn't at all \"sorry\" for being late at all. I thought that was rude but I felt bad bc he was an older gentleman so I still tipped and off he went.   When we opened the pizza: large with pep and jalapenos, the pizza was literally submerged in oil! We had to use the whole stack of napkins to blot out the oil. The other pizza: large with mushroom and broc wasn't too bad but it wasn't too tasty.   If this place was the only place for nearby pizza, I'd try again but thankfully I have other choices! And I'd order a week in advance just to make sure I get the food on-time! Another one and done...yuk!",

To the point that I'm planning on finding time on our trip to order one of his Calzones.  Trust me when I say that this pizza is top of the mark anywhere in New York.  If we end up moving out here, I'll be calling in orders or driving in at least once a week,.  As for the people, the boss is a transplanted New Yorker, a retired fireman,  who's warm, witty, welcoming and shared some of his experiences about what to expect if we decided to move to the Vegas-area (we mentioned that we've been considering it,)  The general consensus is that what makes NY Pizza great is in our water.  Vinny's proves them all wrong.  He's got the magic.",

While I was waiting for my order, the owner Vinny came over and introduced himself, being that he noticed that I was a new face (that's a great sign- means there are a lot of regulars). He is a really nice guy and gave me a brief history of how this restaurant came to be. He's retired FDNY and comes from a large Italian family who had a pizza place in Brooklyn.   That's when I got really excited. Because I was pretty sure this pizza was going to be great. I had ordered an 18\" pepperoni and bacon pizza.  I ran home and opened up the box. HUGE slices, and definitely authentic New York Style. I took one bite and was in love.  I also got the combo appetizer and a small salad, and that was delicious too.   Of course there was no way I was going to finish the pizza and appetizer in one sitting. So I'll be having leftovers for the next few days. Fine by me!  Thanks Vinny! You have one more regular now :)",

The prices are very reasonable and the owner is super nice. Most importantly, the food is great! I've only eaten the Philly cheese steak so far. Vinny recommended that I try his pizza, but I'm so addicted to his cheese steak, I don't know if I'll ever order anything else! I really like the French fries too. I usually overload mine with salt, but these fries don't really need it. I'm very satisfied with my food and service experiences here.",

I didnt review at that time because the driver, an older nice man, called saying he was running late and he apologized again when delivering food...2nd time the fingers were so small & not very good & the pizza was just soaking in so much grease...but we enjoyed their burgers and kids still ate the pizza after I wiped off the grease w/paper towels! Now tonight...delivery was on time, pizza was hot, & the burgers were amazing! You might think its weird since its a pizza place but you must order their burgers! We will be ordering again & hopefully we get the same results as tonight! I think the owner read some of the old reviews & made the right changes, I might even take a chance & give the chicken fingers another try next time!",

Hot wings on the smaller more natural sized side, crispy edges, good heat, and well sauced without being wet and dripping. Cheesesteak with everything means cheese, peppers, onions, and mushrooms. I prefer mine with a drizzle of ranch sauce, but even without it the sandwich was juicy, flavorful, the bread held up well but was soft, came with seasoned fries...perfect! We indulged with tiramisu - thankfully had the forethought to get two - perfectly balanced, good coffee flavor, creamy, rich but not too sweet. Was ready on time, had carry out service (wow!), and the aroma in the car had my mouth watering. Will definitely order again!!",

I feel so bad taking so long to write this review.. I came here with my pain in the butt who claimed this was the place to go for my beloved NY style pizza.. I immediately thought umm what do you know about NYC pizza you are from North Carolina, but I went anyway. I am a tough critic when it comes to my Pizza, Chinese, Gyros, Sandwiches... yes sandwiches,  or Italian food.. I was born and raised in Brooklyn NYC so we are naturally tough critics from birth. Well let me start off by saying the prices remind me of my beloved NYC neighborhood pizzerias. The ingredients are fresh and the pizza can be folded! Yes this passes the fold test.. The wings were really good also and they have blue cheese.. major plus... Anyone from NY the city or upstate knows wings should only be served with blue cheese and please do not dip your pizza in ranch. All I can say is from the decor to the small dining room I felt like I was back in Brooklyn for the hour we were there.. Keep in mind the food didn't take that long but my pain in the butt likes to talk and in his mind him and Vinny go way back... All and all great job Vinny for bringing a taste of NYC to Vegas.",

Payless Pizza is a small pizza joint that is big on taste and easy on your pocket. Vinny the owner gave us great service. We got a large pizza, a few sides of meatballs and a large antipasto salad. The portions were good size. The meatballs and pizza were the best I have since visiting the east coast. As a Californian ranch dressing lover I also enjoyed their homemade ranch. Vinny didn't like that I put ranch on the meatballs (because like any True Italian they dont get the non-Italain obsession with ranch). Even with our difference of opinion of the ranch and its use, Vinny still gave me and my friends service with a smile. We have found our new favorite place to get delicious Italian food a short journey from the strip. Thanks again Vinny for the great food, service and being a former NYC firefighter. We will definitely be stopping in anytime we are in Vegas.",

I've always had great experiences walking into small hole in the wall places that I would normally never drive by, so when I came across Vinnys Payless pizza, I had to see what it was all about...When I met Vinny ,the owner, I had no idea what to get. And instead of telling me how incredible the food was like most restaurant owners, he gave me a free pepperoni slice and told me I will be ADDICTED. And boy was he right !!!! Even though I wanted to buy a whole pizza to myself after tasting the best pizza of my life, I had to hold myself back because of my low carb diet. So Vinny went out of his way again and prepared the most incredible Gyro salad that I ever had which was not even on the menu !! What makes this place so different and special besides the fact that the food is so incredibly good, fresh, and ADDICTING, is the generosity, service, and passion that Vinny displays with every person that walks into his place, even though they are complete strangers. I just met this guy and already I feel like I am a part of the family. That's how comfortable this guy makes you feel !!!! Thanks for everything Vinny !! You got another customer for life !!!!!!",
