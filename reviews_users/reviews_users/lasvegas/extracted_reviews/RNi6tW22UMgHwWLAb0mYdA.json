    "text": "This used to be our favorite restaurant until a server was very rise to us.  We sent a letter to the corporate office and got a letter back saying that all their servers are well trained, but we never got an apology, so we had not been back for years.   Last night was our 10th wedding anniversary and my husband has proposed to me at lawrys and wanted to go back there.  I didn't but then because they were participating in restaurant week we decided to go.  We started out half an hour earlier than our reservation so we could have a drink in the bar/ lounge.  Hello - no waitress.  My husband had to join a line at the bar to order drinks and bring them to our table himself.  We got seated eventually and my husband ordered the 8 oz prime rib and I ordered the salmon, both of which were on the restaurant week menu.  The bread was good, but they need to do something about that nasty messy gummy spinning bowl salad.  I had forgotten that I used to order it with dressing on the side.  It was awful.  We waited a full 40 minutes for our food to be served, and this was after having to ask the waiter why.  He said the chef was cooking the salmon - for 40 mins?  When the salmon finally came it was way too salty.  The prime rib server reached his fork into a kind of gutter at the back of his cart and hooked the fattest piece of meat and started to cut off the fat.  My husband objected strongly and he cut a piece of good meat.  Because we had complained to the waiter about the long wait, a female manager came over and gave us a bag with lawrys seasoned salt, Seasoned pepper and fudge ice cream topping.  They did give us a dry-tasting chocolate piece of cake for our anniversary.  All in all, a very unpleasant experience for a lot of money.  We shall not return",

The spinning bowl salad is a treat and comes included in the meal. Even though it costs extra I highly recommend the baked potato with all the fixings. They do offer other options for those not eating prime rib but let's be honest, unless you're keeping someone company you're mistaken not to get the prime rib. It's that good.",

Nothing was bad by any means but nothing was impressive.  It was, as the Yelp! two stars would indicate, \"meh.\"  The \"famous\" spinning salad did not merit the plaudits it's received.  Again, not bad, but nothing special.  The prime rib was fine.  Had much better.  And the waitresses dressed like Aunt Jemima did not exactly scream elegance.  Perhaps I am a snob.  Or just a fussy New Yorker.  But compared to some of the truly great steakhouse in Vegas, Lawry's is a chain that disappoints.",

    "text": "Came here for me and my boyfriend's one year anniversary.. We were early for our reservations because we were worried about the traffic along paradise and flamingo since there is always constructions around the area.   We were seated right away. The atmosphere of the restaurant was awesome. Our waitress was very friendly and informative. She gave us a good amount of time to look at the menu and know exactly what we wanted by the time she came back to take our order. Of course, my boyfriend and I had the Prime Ribs dinners. The Prime Ribs dinners comes with the famous spinning salads, mash potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, and whipped cream horseradish. If you want the cream corn it is extra $7, it's worth it.   The boyfriend got the Lawry's cut (10oz) and mash potatoes with a size of asparagus and lobster tail. And I got the English cut (6.5oz) with cream corn and mash potatoes. When our waitress came to our table with the spinning salad, she was talking to us while making the salad, asked us if we were visiting? Locals? And what occasions we were celebrating? We told her what what the occasions and from there, the conversation got deeper. The salad was good. In fact my boyfriend asked for seconds. The waitress came back to our table with the carver. We told her want we wanted and how we liked it done. My boyfriend devoured his 10oz prime rib and I devoured my 6.5oz prime rib too. Everything was good. Prime rib and the sauce was GREAT! Spinning salad was Great!!! Cream Corn was GREAT!! Mash potatoes was GREAT! But me and my boyfriend wasn't to fond of the Yorkshire pudding and the lobster tail is not worth it. It was over priced and really small for $17. Overall our meal is AMAZING..   Btw, at the end of the meal, our waitress surprised me and my boyfriend with a free carrot cake for our anniversary.",

    "text": "**This is a review for their lunch menu**  I brought my boyfriend here for lunch when we were in Vegas. We came here for lunch because we found out via the website that they have a much cheaper lunch menu!  We ordered the prime rib lunch special (he got the Lawry's cut, I ordered the luncheon cut). It comes with the prime rib, mashed potatoes, a side, bread, and their whipped horseradish. The prime rib was still flavorful and whatnot. The mashed potatoes weren't up to par with the Beverly Hills location, which is a huge bummer for me, because I LOVE my potatoes. We both ordered the creamed corn on the side and we split an extra side of the creamed spinach (with bacon!). They were good too in terms of flavor.  The way it works though, is that instead of them taking the order and bringing the food to you, you go to the mini carvery corner and get the food yourself. The problem with that is that the meat sits out longer because the carver cuts them for people in line and so by the time you get the table it cools down a lot. Also, the creamed corn just sits in the heated pots (like how they serve soups at buffets), so it starts to separate, bunching up on top. The server mixes it together before he serves it, but if I'm paying a lot for food, I don't want that kind of quality.  I'm sure the dinner is much better, of course, but I didn't want to come to Lawry's for dinner in Las Vegas, when we have one in LA anyways. I'd rather go somewhere I can't find near home!",

    "text": "Wow, did I really go to the same place as all the other Yelpers?!  I feel it my civic duty to add my 2 cents.   As a disclaimer, my husband and I enjoy a good prime rib.  We used to live in the Bay Area and frequented HOPR in SF.  Our options are limited in SD and thus we arrived at Lawry's Vegas looking forward to a nice piece of meat!  The service was just eh for the price you're paying.  Our waitress at one point came over and excused herself to \"need to attend to something\" before taking our order.  She then immediately went to the table across from us and chatted up the couple and their child, who sat down 10 minutes after us, for a good 15-20 minutes!!   She obviously knew them and was in no hurry to tend to us.  The one star she gets was the fact they noted it was my husbands birthday and thus brought out a comp dessert.    The food was rather mediocre as well.  The salad was rather bland and non-descript.  As per usual Lawry's style, the prime rib is served straight from the carving cart at your table.  The meat was actually a little cold - I guess that's what happens when the restaurant is more than half empty.  The flavor of the prime rib was also quite lacking.    My cut was especially tough (despite being \"medium rare\") - you know when you chew a piece of bad meat and just have to chew and chew and chew until your jaw is sore and then finally you can swallow?  So incredibly disappointing.  On top of that paying Vegas prices for sub par food.    Do yourself a favor and PASS on this chain establishment in Vegas.",

I mentioned it was national prime rib day and she told us because we mentioned it we would get a free prime rib upgrade. Nice. We started with the artichoke hearts fried with 2 dipping sauces. They were pretty good. Then we had the spinning salad meh it was ok. We added the Lawry's seasoned pepper as Ms.Monroe suggested. It did give it some extra flavor. The wait between courses was perfect. So I upgraded my potatoes to the special Yukon gold mash,glad I did my husband stuck with the regular mash and mine were much better. The creamed corn was the best I've ever had. The popover was also pretty good. So you may be wondering why only 3 stars? The Prime rib was pretty much the worst I have ever had, and I love prime rib. Gold Coast, South point, Both have better prime rib for a lot less money. It had no flavor, we asked for medium which was blood red. So we went for medium well. Which was still pink so it should not have been like chewing on gum. Tasteless gum at that. You would think that a seasoning brand restaurant would have some very well seasoned beef. My husband got the diamond Jim cut. Had a crust with no flavor. What? How can this be. We did not join the club. We will not be returning. To many better less expensive places to go. But we were impressed with the service and the side dishes.",

This was my first time at the Las Vegas location (usually go to Beverly Hills) and the venue was similar, but I would have to say less crowded.  Its not on the Strip, but if you are looking for a good prime rib dinner experience, then it is worth the drive.  It's hard to leave room for dessert, but I've tried all the desserts and liked every single one.",

We ordered a bottle of wine which was finished by the time they served our meal since it took so long and at the end they just gave us a hot chocolate fudge sauce as an apology!!!! Seriously????!!! Felt horrible since we were taking some especial guests there !",

We were led through to the back room where we were seated at a booth.  Our server was Ms Huang who was very polite, efficient and very smiley throughout.  We opted for the Pimms cocktail and Moscow Mule, both drinks were disappointing, perhaps because the ginger ale tasted flat?? We ordered the Lawrys cut prime rib medium rare, with creamed corn, spinach, along with the mash potato and gravy and yorkshire pudding.  The prime rib was delicious.  I wasnt keen on the spinach but the creamed corn was on par with many other restaurants.  The yorkshire pudding was disappointing, oily and far too eggy tasting.  Despite being very full, we still wanted dessert! We wanted the macadamia pie but they were out by the time we ordered (around 9.30pm) so we went for the sticky toffeepudding.  Coming from the Uk, I know my yorkshire pudding and sticky toffee pudding, and unfortunately, although they were ok, they werent the best.  Overall we did enjoy our experience and most importantly the prime rib was good.",

They carve the prime rib right by your table in a cart. Cream corn is my favorite side. For dessert you can't go wrong with the CC browns hot fudge sundae but my personal favorite is the trifle. It's the best salad I've ever had and if you agree, you can bring home the salad dressing, they sell that and cc browns hot fudge.",

From the time we were seated to the time we left, it was a perfect experience. Highlights include nicely made (and quick) martini's, a server (Ms. Aran, I think) who was funny and attentive, and of course, the prime rib.   I wont repeat the many reviews except to say that this place is consistently good and works for both business meals and romantic evenings. Every trip to Vegas will have Lawry's on the itinerary.",

Except for the side dishes, their ONE vegetarian dish, and ONE seafood dish, everything on their menu is prime rib.    Lawry's brings me back in time to the pilgram age...not that I've been there before, but their clothes and name tags such as \"Miss Muppit\" reminds me of the elemetary school history lessons that I had in class.  You know, the one where there's cartoons of thanksgiving characters? Anyway...  Prime rib was GOOD.  Carts of prime rib and sides go around and you pick your cut.  Cuts range from 10 oz to 22oz.  Prices range from $30-$40.   Every prime rib dish comes with their delicious signature salad tossed at tableside...mixed in were these crunchy, collapse-in-your-mouth croutons.  Also with the prime rib was a side of mashed potatoes.  As a tip, be careful if they ask \"would you like a side of cream of corn or spinach\".....we said yes, but we found out later, we were charged extra for it.",

I've made reservations on both occasions, and that seems to be the best way to do it.  The staff is very accommodating, I've rescheduled reservations several times without a problem.  Walking into Lawry's, the ambiance is very old school.  The restaurant is a bit formal so I dress up whenever I visit.  Lawry's is mainly known for their prime rib, but they do serve other dishes as well.  I usually go with the prime rib though.  There are several different cuts of the prime rib that you can choose from, and all dinners come with their famous spinning bowl salad, mashed potatoes, and yorkshire pudding.  The spinning bowl salad has shredded beets in it which is a nice touch.  Lawry's also has their own homemade spices made specifically to season their salads.  The Lawry's cut is the perfect amount in my opinion.  I've gotten a larger cut the first time, and that was way too much prime rib.  I always get a lobster tail as well with my prime rib for an extra charge of $12.  Service is always friendly and on point.  They do offer a point system loyalty card for a one time purchase.  If I lived in Vegas I would definitely get that card for extra benefits.",

I can say the service was top notch, Cesar was extremely professional and quick to meet my tables each and every need, if I had a restaurant I would have him as the trainer. The location is easy and central. Ideal for any occasion. Now to the food part. I know you'll say \" who goes to Lawry's and gets pastrami\" but I did, it was recommended and it is my favorite sandwich. The pastrami is what docked the experience two stars. There was very little seasoning, a bit too much fat, and missed that good pastrami bite. I have had pastrami all over the country, I could say this didn't make it to the top twenty even. The homemade potato chips were good as well was the condiment bar. I can just say for a $14 sandwich and a $3.50 club soda, the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. I would tag this meal at a worth of right around $8.00  Maybe someone will convince me to go back and try the primerib, I will then update.",

I have always seen those Lawry's seasonings in the store and perhaps even used some while cooking before. When I arrived it pulled into valet and was kindly greeted by one of the valet attendants! They do offer complimentary valet so why not? Self parking is also an option for those of you who may be wondering, it's located near the back of the restaurant. The ambiance of the place is pretty cool!   Our company had already selected some dishes that we may choose from. We started off with trays of appetizers one of them which was a smoked salmon on a cracker bread type thing and the other was some sort of taquito type of thing. Next up they brought out plates of \"The Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad\" which was fantastic! Some people at my table didn't really like the egg taste it had however I loved it. For my main course I selected the Atlantic Salmon.  I know I know, who the hell comes to a place that's known for it's Prime Rib and get's some damn fish?! Ha! Me! But I had a plan and that was to order this fish AND eat off my co-workers plate to try their prime rib! Sharing is caring remember? Let's talk about how they bring out this cool oven like carving station kind of thing. That was pretty fascinating! The severs were all very pleasant and I thought that the uniforms were umm idk like are they were maids/pilgrims/omish type of theme. Talk about attentive! My glass stayed full of water and for those who ordered any other kind of beverage they never let it stay empty! Once the food came out those of us who ordered fish received ours first and the others who had prime rib had to wait since the type of temperature of how the prime rib was cooked would be different for each person. My Atlantic Salmon was delicious and the fresh asparagus it came with was a great pair! As far as the Prime Rib, I got to try medium well and also medium. Both were good however I would opt for medium IF I was to ever return for another dining experience. The creamed spinach was amazing! We closed the night out with their signature Creme Brulee and it was amazing! All in all it was a great experience and I would love to come back sometime in the near future!",

The prime rib was perfect the lobster was flawless and the potatoes were legit. The server was on point. Took care of us but wasn't intrusive. It was seriously an experience I will brag about forever and this was probably my 10th time there. Outstanding guys and I'll be back again this year for sure.",

    "text": "TL;DR The food is decent, but nothing outstanding compared to what's close by  First off, I have to remove my hat before entering the dining room? Sure, forgot it was 1956. Oh, look at how the wait staff is dressed... like they are in 1956 working on a plantation in the south. Next the hostess pulled the table out of the booth so we could get in.... pulled it ALL the way out. I guess if I was in my 70s with bad hips, that would be a blessing (though, they didn't pull it when I was leaving). There was a lot of dishes dropping during our dinner. At least 3 separate things within the first 15 minutes.  I had the prime rib lawreys cut. It was good, but nothing that stood out compared to prime rib at any other restaurant. The salad was pretty good. I think they deep fry their croutons.  The ambiance is pretty outdated. The service was decent. The food was good. Overall I probably wouldn't come back unless I was bringing my grandma for dinner.",

Sure I've had amazing prime rib, service, and experience at a steakhouse like Lawry's, HoPR, etc, but it just seems like the quality isn't there anymore that made this chain and location famous to begin with.  From the acclaimed spinning salad to the amazing creamed spinach and corn, it was all just mediocre here and for the price point I was sadly very disappointed considering the options on the strip.  If you want to avoid that and have a car though, this might be a place to check out and hope for the best. The large portions of prime rib will always help somehow.",

We had the prime rib, my wife had the California cut and we both had the lawrys cut. It's just enough.  I could easily have eaten the diamond jim cut but didn't want to make a pig of myself. My only complaint is my wife asked for an end piece and was just told no, we don't have any. I can't believe in all the carts they couldn't come up with an end for her.   She doesn't like red meat so it was a little disappointing they didn't offer to get her an end or a better cooked piece. It was late, our reservation was for 8 and the place was nearly empty. We had a side of mushrooms ($11) that easily fed all three of us with some left over. The Yorkshire pudding was great as always. Creamed cord side is additional but my son and I both got it and it was phenomenal. Mashed comes standard with gravy and was creamy good. For desert I had the fudge Sunday, my wife had the sticky toffee and my son had sherbet. All were good.  Add in a bottle of wine and the total price was over 300 but well worth it. Great meal, good service and relaxed atmosphere.",

Tender, melted in my mouth and I could have eaten more. I also opted for the creamed spinach which was ok.   Overall, Lawry's was a great atmosphere.

    "text": "So I made dinner reservations for 4 people at 7 P.M. for my dad's birthday. I kept seeing people come in and seated before us. It was already 7:20 and there was a big group and I told myself that if this group goes in before us, there is something wrong...and what do you know! The hostess called the big group before us! So I went to the receptionist that I talked to when I came in and she said that \"someone\" erased our dinner reservations and that she'll call the manger to fix it. So I told my dad and he was very upset. The manager came after a few minutes and showed us to our seat. He apologized and was very accommodating. Since we don't drink, he started us off with some appetizers. He comped two appetizers, the lobster bruschetta and the calamari. I would order the bruschetta again, it was delish! I would get the calamari also, but I don't like octopus that much. The food was amazing, which I already knew it would be; even the desserts! We were stuffed! It was not my first time to Lawry's; I've been to the one in Beverly Hills. I was really impressed with the manager, Bruce! He was very nice and kind; though, I think the receptionist smile a lot more and more friendly to the costumers and admit your mistake. Because of Bruce, we had a pleasant AND delicious dinner!!",

This place is definitely upscale and I felt out of place the first time as I had dressed casual. Second time I knew better.   The lighting is dim and almost has a ballroom type of feel inside. I love that they bring the cart to the table and you can choose which cut you'd like and also how rare or well you want it cooked along with your sides.  If you get prime rib it comes with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. I wasn't a fan of the Yorkshire pudding i also had creamed spinach. My favorite cut is the English. 3 thinly sliced pieces of prime rib my guy always gets the Larry cut which is the thicker cut on the bone. The best part of the meal is watching them spin the salad tableside. If you fancy prime rib you'll love this place. Just come hungry. I've never had room for dessert and I never finish my meal.",

Au jus... just right.   Strange, tacky and awesome decor with a peculiar dress code for the female staff. I love it. And hey, they spin their salads as they prepare it table-side. Once that beautiful Airstream contraption rolls up to the table and the literally trained meat surgeons slice up your desired portion you'll understand what the hype is all about.    Even you don't think it's the best (although you might) you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "So, I guess if you eat at any place often enough, one of your visits will be the worst. This visit was that.  I'll preface it with this...the food was fine (as usual). My/our problem was primarily our server...Mr. Berber. Quite possibly one of the worst services I had in recent memory. A server can make or break a meal. Although Mr. Berber had good knowledge of the menu, his execution AS a waiter was the issue. Whilst taking order, he did the very least he could. I guess that fulfills the bare minimum to qualify as a waiter. I often find exceptional wait staff can make a meal amazing and tend to seek them out when I find them (looking at you Mrs. Seargent/Beverly Hills).   So, probably my biggest pet peeve, is beverage service. Especially when you have an assistant, your drinks shouldn't ever hit the bottom of the glass. I only drink soda so I'll go through several in a meal. I had to ask each and every time for a refill and it felt like I was imposing on him for special treatment. To compound this, Mr. Berber DISAPPEARED FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AT A TIME! (which probably explains why our dinner, that started at 7pm, ended at 10:30) Really!!! I observed that Mr. Berber had three tables, our table with nine people and two small tables with two people each. All within close proximity. How hard can this be.   Other things I noticed...initially, Didn't clear the extra table setting, Nine people, one basket of bread. five minutes for water. Salad seemed...just OK. Dinner plate appeared sloppy. I dined at Lawry's five days prior and the plate looked magnificent and tonight's looked like a child plated it. Just seems like the attention to detail has declined at this location.  This is an annual tradition to attend this location this time of year for this group of people and most of them would just let this slide, but I feel if Lawry's cares about it's experience and how their customers perceive their service, then they should start to scrutinize their staff and their practices. Beverly Hills IS the standard and I expect to have that experience at EVERY Lawry's. I'm a platinum member and enjoy the Lawry's experience...just bummed about this one.",

When we were seated I guess I wasnt expecting the throwback to the 1950s era.  All the waitress's look like hotel maids.  And the whole area has this like fancy steakhouse for back then appeal.  It's not my favorite but for those who like it go for it.  Service was mediocre at best.  She'd come only every so often and wasnt on top of us for drinks.  If she were she could of easily forked a good 100$ more out of us from alcohol beverages alone.    Food was pretty killer.  I love a good prime rib so theres was delicious.  And the sides that come with it were pretty killer on their own as well.  Overall great restraunt, good quality food.  Service was a little bit slow but nothing horrible.  And to me i just felt cramped atmosphere wise.  Thinking back i dont think i saw a window in the dining area.",

Unreal, this place hits in all cylinders. The atmosphere, amazing! Real old school look with the wood and comfy couches. If you close your eyes. You could envision gentlemen walking in with their overcoats and fedora...  The service, impeccable! Not a thing out of place not a step of service missed. Our waiter was friendly and most of all knowledgeable. He gave us a run down of everything we needed to know! The food... the food, the food, the food!!! Now this is prime beef at its best! Prepared right and served, perfectly! Table side and cut to order! The spinning salad was made table side, the food was team served... everything was phenomenal! I for one can not wait for my next trip to Vegas! Lawry's will definitely be on my go to list!",

However, if I am going to a place with a particular staple IN their name, I will order it anyways...after all, that's what they specialize in right??  I went with the Lawry Cut ($43): Mashed Potatoes, Yorkshire Pudding, and Creamed Spinach ($6). Again, not a big fan of prime rib, but this was pretty tasty. The sides are all good...nothing extraordinary, but solid company for the beef.  Also added a Lobster Tail ($14). Good lobster at a great price if you add it to a prime rib dinner. Wish it was a little more tender or flavorful, but a solid choice nonetheless.  And finished with the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($8): Warm Toffee Caramel Sauce and Haagen-Dazs Pralines & Cream. Pretty good! Don't compare it to GR's version, and you will enjoy it :P  Overall, it's a solid restaurant, and if you are a prime rib fan, I think you will have a great time!  Pics :",

I can only get here about once a year, but believe me I'm thinking about it for the other 364 days. Went here this past weekend and our party (9 people) were seated in the back room near the wine cellar. It was a nice, quiet, private room, since no other groups were in there, but we were also like \"Wait, are we back here because we're so ugly?!\" haha.   As usual I got the traditional Lawry's cut prime rib. Love the spinning salad. How original. Usually I'll pass on salad before a meal, but here I'll eat whatever they put in front of my face. The bread, though understated, is AMAZING. Warm, soft sourdough. *Drool* Then comes my fine hunka meat. HUGE beautiful piece of prime rib. Every bite...yum. I can't even describe.  Sure, it's pricey, but SO worth it.",

This was my first visit, a meeting with some vendor folks, and I was blown away.  I definitely did not expect to like it as much as I did.  I had Mirror Pond Pale Ale, the Lawry's cut, medium, mashed potatoes and creamed corn.  We started with calamari, which was great.  Apparently they had sent back the first calamari, but I didn't notice as I was completely engrossed in conversation, so I'm not dropping from 5 stars.  I ate calamari from the second plate and it was fine.  I'm not huge on red meat, and I probably eat a steak or prime rib a MAXIMUM of a couple times a month.  I'm pretty happy my April binge was spent at Lawry's.  I will be going back.",

I didn't feel that umph that I should in a fine dining establishment, I didn't feel the difference between a prime spot and just another steakhouse!    I give you 3 stars today Lawry's cause the class was there, but I just didn't feel it during my personal experience.... maybe the waitress was having a bad day, but I didn't really even hear a peep out of her.  I'll never stop my Lawry's prime rib visits, but quality of service needs a jumpstart!",

    "text": "The worst dining experience I ever had!  Not sure where to begin. Here it goes.  First I am not the one to waste time writing reviews but this evening really made me want to share w the world how horrible the service and food was.  So this was our first time dining at Lawrys.  Drove in and saw complimentary valet parking but took self parking since it was not full. Arrived at around 6:15pm w my party of 12 for my brother in law's 50th birthday. Walked into the lobby and about 4 hosts were standing in front to greet us wearing full on suits.  There was a sign that read appropriate attire required.  Looked at the posted menu and was shocked to see high priced entrees - $40-60.  So at this point at minimum I'm expecting top quality service and food for these prices.  Unfortunately it did not happen.   We walked in the dining room area to get seated and first thing I notice is old ladies dressed in what looked like old maid hats and uniforms as waitresses.  I felt like I was walking back in time a few decades.  Looking around the room clientele was mostly elderly men and one family w two small kids.  Our party ranged in ages from 5-50 years old.  There were no kids menus but was told I could ask waitress for kid-friendly offerings. Was given two options: chicken tenders or petite sized cut of meat w so called spinning salad where all they really do is mix in the dressing in front of u.  I could honestly do that myself.  Not much of a service to offer customers as the waitress basically lifted a bottle of salad dressing way high and poured it into the salad bowl to toss table side.  Big deal and not impressed! Salad was nothin special either.   My 16 yr old niece didn't care for anything on the menu and wanted to order chicken tenders.  Our waitress was pretty cold as she told her chicken tenders are only for kids 12 and under. I would expect this type of restaurant would accommodate her request but nothing was remotely even offered as a suggestion.  My husband had to ask for an exception so she said she would ask the manager.  Came back and said the manager would allow her to have chicken tenders if she paid for an adult sized meal - $39!!  So ok fine we ordered it so she would not starve and they came back and gave her 3 pieces of breaded chicken - nothing fancier than tenders u would get at TGIFridays. Gets worse - it turns out to be the same size as the $20 kids meal that my 5 yr old was served!  We expected at least she would get an adult sized portion having to pay the $39 adult meal!!!!   We asked to speak to the manager but instead the waitress came back out w two additional pieces of chicken.  What a load of crap this deal was!  We were furious.  Had it not been my brother in laws birthday we seriously would have walked out of the restaurant.  We felt like we were being taken advantage of by charging us exorbitantly expensive prices for kids meals that were worth $5!  My husband and brother in law ordered the same cut of meat but my husband's slice of meat was significantly less than my brother Iaws portion.  It was cut thick on one side and very thin at the other end.  The waitress explained that my brother in law's cut of meat had the bone in.  She was going to leave it at that but husband continued to question it.  She then came back out w another plate.  Seriously - do u argue w the customer at this class of restaurant?  The fact that she tried to defend her explanation when it was obvious that the two portions were not equal as they sat side by side really ticked us off.    At the end we were all very unhappy.  No manager ever came out to talk to us and we spent between $500-600 for food that was just ok and service that sucked!   We will never go back here and will tell all of our friends and family what a miserable experience we had!!!!!!",

    "text": "Great Prime Rib in an old-school setting.  The place wasn't very crowded on the Tuesday night we went, and service was quick and attentive.  Server was dressed in a period-type costume/uniform (perhaps circa the 40's or 50's), and introduced herself and Ms. (Last Name).  Cute touch, but for some reason made me feel a little uncomfortable.  No matter, she delivered great service the rest of the evening, even graciously changed out my lady's cocktail when it wasn't what she thought it would taste like.  Spinning salad was good, and the sides of creamed corn and spinach were okay, but the star of the evening was the prime rib.  I had the regular Lawry's cut, but our carver nicely gave me the bone attached (I guess it had to go anyway on that particular slice - I'm not complaining).  I'll tell you that prime rib was amongst the best I've ever had.  Coupled with some great mashed potatoes and a nice ladle of jus, that was one good meal.  Oh, and our server told us that we could ask for more Yorkshire pudding, which was a nice tip.  However, why fill up on what was originally designed to stretch the meat in a poor English meal?  There's plenty of meat to go around!",

    "text": "If I died and went to Heaven it could only be so if it had Lawry's. Cause how could you have a place with eternal bliss if it didn't have the prime rib I had at Lawry's?  My boyfriend took me to Lawry's for the first time on my birthday. The usual fanfare, cool restaurant, reservations and our \"good\" clothes. I think I was unprepared for how good it was to be. Our server introduced himself and his assistant to us. He then proceeded to recite the entire menu and ask if we had questions. He then took our beverage order and explained he would be back with the salad. My wine showed up along with a nice basket of bread and the evening took off from there.  The salad was quite a show. I didn't think he would actually be spinning the bowl of salad on a bed of ice while he poured the dressing on high. Then he artfully tossed it and plated it while the bowl was still going. I'm not a big fan of romaine and I normally can't stand Iceburg lettuce but this may be the exception. The dressing, chopped egg and the croutons \"make\" this salad. It disappeared from my plate in a jiffy. I want to note that I think the service was awesome. The timing on everything was uncanny and we never felt rushed or ignored. No sooner than we had finished our salad the the server appeared with the carver and the giant silver cart. We each told the server what we wanted and he relayed our order to the carver. Now I do think it was a bit amusing since I am sure the chef could hear us but I guess it only added to the ambiance of the experience. I would say it was more like the style of the waiter conveying our order to the \"kitchen.\"  So on to the prime rib. I got the Lawry's cut medium rare with a side of creamed corn. I don't think phenomenal is a good enough word to describe the taste explosion I experienced. The beef was tender, juicy and it melted in my mouth. It had a meaty rich taste and the first bite almost caused me to salivate instantly. It was exquisitely medium rare and rested gently in a pool of heavenly au jus. The mashed potatoes and gravy rivaled anything my mom could make (Sorry Mom!) and the creamed corn was like eating the most delicious candy you've ever had. The crown for all of this goodness was a eggy yummy Yorkshire pudding. The outside was crispy and the inside was soft and a giant hunk of it vanished from my plate instantly. I was really pleased that they also gave us both straight up horseradish and the creamy as well. That way I was able to blend just right. If I hadn't been so pleasantly full I would have gone for a dessert. Everything on the dessert menu was simply mouthwatering.  All in all, wonderful service, taste bud shattering food and even though it is a bit pricey really worth it. I will just have to go again.",

When we sat down our waitress was Ms. Yost who we could tell was a little new but she spoke with confidence and seemed to enjoy her job because she smiled with every word. We ordered the Lawry cut which was an amazing piece of prime rib. Along with that we had creamed spinach, mashed potatoes (Which I'm glad they didn't try to reinvent), and creamed corn which was given to us complimentary after a slight mix-up with what we ordered. I usually don't order dessert but we did and were pleasantly with the bread pudding which was served with Vanilla ice cream while swimming in just enough butterscotch topping. We spoke with the manager of the restaurant and could tell why her employees seemed happy. She was down to Earth and seemed extremely proud of her restaurant which she should be. She mentioned a code of ethics that the restaurant lives by which I took a picture of. Amazing restaurant.  I wish Yelp allowed me to give 10 stars.",

If you're stuck waiting ona  table, the bar has plenty of sports and well-mixed cocktails.  Reservations?  You'll be fast-seated and waiting in a large, red velvet booth.  All the waitresses are ladies who reminded me of Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast, prim maid costumes.  Everything's about style and presentation here, coupled with deliciousness.  I love the giant Pulitzer Prize-style medallions every chef wears!    The giant salad is big, but every cut of prime rib is twice the size you think it is when you see it in the menu.  English Cut would be the sane man's choice -- the Lawry's is for leftover prime rib sandwiches the next day.  (Delicious even then!)   Their creamed corn is not to be missed either, trust us!  We never knew we would be so amped about creamed corn either until we were halfway through our portions demanding more.  It's a fun place for a family and it's not at all as expensive as strip restaurant dinners.  I suggest it if you're looking for an experience and can't make it to the home location in LA.",

    "text": "I love this place. Just finished a great dinner put with my boss. Lawrys has a consistency that you can depend on, yet also somehow manages to exeeed your expectations at the same time. I made a reservation, and even though we arrived a little early they were able to take us to our table right away. Our server was excellent. My only complaint is that I can't remember her last name. The last name thing makes it a little harder to remember, but she was absolutely fantastic as was the male server we had last time. This place really knows customer service. I was trying to remember the kind of wine i wanted and she randomly suggested a malbec, which is exactly what I wanted.  We both ordered the Lawry's cut prime rib and for those that aren't aware it comes with a salad and mashed potatoes. You can also order spinach and sweet corn when the carver comes to the table. The salad is ok in my opinion. I like the beets and the croutons, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it or anything. However the prime rib is awesome. I ate every delicious, perfectly cooked medium rare bite. Mashed potatoes are great and I surprised myself this time and tried the Yorkshire bread pudding bread (pudding to me is not bread or cake, but whatever) and dipped in the au jus and it was so good... Kind of like a beef dip.  Afterwards, the waitress recommended the Sticky Toffee pudding and the chocolate fantasy cake. I ordered the pudding and my boss tried the cake. I was a little disappointed when she set a cake in front of me, but i have to tell you that it was also delicious. I would definitely order it again. My boss was very happy with the cake. Neither one of us could finish our desserts though. We were stuffed!   When we walked outside we had to wait just a few minutes but the valet brought my car very quickly. Excellent customer service by everyone. I can totally see why this place is still always busy.",

Wasnt sure they served lunch because one website said they stopped but glad i checked because it was worth it. Its like a steakhouse on the Strip minus the surly service, crazy high prices, hassle of walking through the hotel and paying for parking.   The dining room makes you feel as if youre in the 1920s and the female servers are dressed in fun uniforms. Not sure if they only have female servers which would be interesting because some steakhouses like Joes Stone Crab only have male servers .   Lunch seemed to have a more varied menu and it wasnt as busy when we went but the food was still spectacular. We have the Prime Rib panini which was a really light and very flavorful steak sandwhich. It only had 3 oz of steak but it was more than enough. The prime rib plates are a lot but its fascinating to see it carved tableside and the sides served up in a matter of seconds. Id caution to be careful with portion size here as these are huge cuts. My other friend had the turkey sandwhich and while it was great it needed to either be grilled or updated with a better mayo spread. It was just very basic.    Overall, id definitely go back and recommend to friends.",

I did not get the prime rib, and I'm glad I did not. I took a bite of the prime rib off another one of my friend's plates, and it was most certainly not a $50 prime rib. More like a $15.00 prime rib at best.  I personally got the lobster bisque, sauteed mushrooms, and fried calamari. The lobster was bland. I couldn't taste any lobster at all.  The sauteed mushrooms tasted like they were a frozen dinner. Not savory or buttery at all. The fried calamari was just as bland as everything else. The sauces didn't go well with the calamari at all. I've honesty had more flavorful fried calamari at fast food joints at 1/5 of the price.  Long story short, this place is a cash sink. You can literally do better at places on the strip for a fraction of the price.",

I love that they've kept their traditions all these years and when you walk in it really does feel like you're stepping back in time.  The Art Deco decor. The oversized green velvet booths. The chilled salad forks given to you for their famous spinning salad. The uniforms worn by all employees. The beautiful silver carts making their way around the entire restaurant. The spice blend created by the owner that goes great sprinkled over pretty much everything. The food is simple and simply delicious.   Get the prime rib, this is what they're known for. I enjoyed the English cut offering thinner pieces and I love all the sides. Buttery mashed potatoes with gravy are decadent and go very well with the creamed corn that's ultra sweet and the bacon & onion creamed spinach. Your meal also comes with Yorkshire pudding which is a fluffy delight and perfect for soaking up all the au jus on your plate.   They pride themselves with their service and have been going strong since 1938! Clearly this place is doing something right.",

    "text": "YUM. Lawrys is known for its prime rib and now I know why! This was my first time at a lawrys and it did not disappoint. It's located 10 min off the strip next to a bunch of other nice restaurants and casinos. My boyfriend and I ubered there from the Aria, but they also have free valet service if you happen to be driving.   I called earlier in the day to make a reservation for 7:30 for two. Luckily, we were able to get a spot last minute. The place itself is huge! There's lots of seating, but reservations are recommended. It's good for big and small parties.   I ordered a glass of Kim Crawford but our waiter recommended a similar wine for around the same price. I decided to go with it, but can't seem to remember the name. It ended up being $18 versus the $15 glass of Kim Crawford. We both got the Lawrys cut prime rib. Each meal comes with their spun salad, mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. If you're a meat lover definitely get the lawrys cut because it's thicker. You can also get creamed corn or spinach on the side but honestly, the set meal is just enough food. Service was really good although our meal took a while because our server was also helping a huge party before us. Also, it's really good for special occasions! We went for my birthday and they brought out a complementary vanilla bundt cake with peach compote!",

    "text": "Lawry's is my #1 favorite prime rib restaurant. I've been to Calvary's in Newport Beach, CA, The Summit in Fullerton, CA, and House of Prime Rib in SF and it's all very similar to Lawry's, but still not the same. Lawry's is hands down THE BEST!   5 STARS FOR EVERYTHING: food, service, ambience, price, free valet, VIP system. Let's break it down, shall we?   Food - I love their prime rib! It's so tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked every time. The portions are good and match with the affordable pricing. You always get the spinning bowl salad which is delicious, along with their Yorkshire pudding, and mashed potatoes & gravy. (Did you know they have garlic mashed potatoes now too? So good!!) This makes for a wonderfully complete meal and I always leave here feeling full and satisfied! Other favorites:   * Sizzling Mushroom Appetizer - I don't even like mushrooms, but I grew to love them because of their sizzling mushroom appetizer. The first thing you smell is the yummcious buttery aroma, and the sizzling platter keeps your mushrooms hot & tasty! A must try, especially if you love mushrooms.   * Lobster - No matter how full you'll think you'll be, you should definitely try/add a side of lobster tail (even to share between a few of you if you have to). Their lobster is so juicy and moist, and perfectly cooked. Served with lemon and drawn butter, I'm often amazed at how delicious it tastes! It's even better than most seafood restaurants I go to.   * Creamed Corn - A side to your meal that can be added. It's my daughter's favorite!! I always ask for it to be served in a separate plate, so it's not soggy in my prime rib plate and is easier to share with others.   * Prime Rib - There's no doubt the prime rib is amazing! I usually get the California cut, which is a perfect portion for me. But on days I'm feeling super hungry and ambitious, I'll get the Lawry's bone-in signature cut! Don't forget to try the Lawry's seasoned salt on your prime rib, a little sprinkle goes a long ways, but adds that nice flavor for those who like to eat more on the salty side like me! Also, on the salad, try sprinkling some \"seasoned pepper\" on there, it's delish!   Service - Impeccable service every time! They are so consistent here...always polite, nice, and attentive. I love that all their servers know what they're doing and the hostess & staff always treat you like you're VIP.   Ambience, Price, Valet, & VIP member - This is such a pretty and elegant restaurant! It looks like a restaurant you'd spend hundreds of $$$ in, but surprisingly, the food and prices are super affordable and reasonable. Plus, they offer free valet. If you are a VIP member like me, you can get points for every visit/dollar you spend. After a certain amount (250 pts?), you get a free $25 Gift Certificate towards your next meal which expires a year later. Eat good food and get free meals, how awesome is that?   They sure know how to do it right here! Everything about this restaurant is classy from the look, feel, and quality of food & service. It's always a great dining experience!",

I ordered the 14 oz. boneless meal that comes with the Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad, scalloped potatoes, and crispy fried onions.  Between the bread and butter, the salad, and my drink (Pimm's Cup), I was too full for dessert.  Our server, Andrea, was very attentive throughout the meal and, overall, it was a very delicious meal to celebrate another year of love together ---ewwww, mushy!  The end.",

Nice place to go for a special occasion. If you like prime rib, you're going to love this place. Our waitress was Miss Gonzalez who was outstanding. You can order any size cut from their carving station which is a cool mobile carving cart on wheels. Starting with the lightest cut of prime rib is their California cut, then their English cut, Lawry's cut, Diamond Jim Brady cut, and finally their Beef bowl double cut. We both ordered the Lawry's cut which was still a lot. Your meal comes with their famous spinning salad which they create table side. Also included is mashed potato and Yorkshire pudding. We did order a side of cream spinach and cream corn (both very tasty). Since we decided to go all out... we ordered the additional lobster tails for two. Oh boy... what a meal!",

Attentive, but not pushy and always around when we needed him. I thought the prime rib was the best I've had in town. I got the Diamond Jim cut because the cuts the other folks at the table were getting looked a little small. I'm glad I did. It was just enough, even with the sides. Their side dishes were really good, ALL of them! My wife had a smaller prime rib and she liked it. We ordered the lobster tail to each have a bit and it was not great. Chewey and overcooked. I'm taking off a star for that. We enjoyed a couple nice bottles of wine, excellent company and a great meal. We'll go back again (this week, I think) and just not order the lobster.

    "text": "Old school prime rib house. Very friendly, attentive server and delicious meats and sides. Off the strip but an easy walk/uber ride away.  Ordered prime rib diamond cut, 24oz ribeye, sides of cream spinach, mash potato of the day (cheese and bacon!), and regular mash potato with gravy for four people and that's enough food. They bring out a huge cart and reveals MASSIVE amounts of meat to cut in front of you. Everything is hot and fresh. Prime ribs are juicy, soft, and perfectly flavored. Ribeye has just the right amount of char on it and was an explosion of flavor. The cheese and bacon mashed potatoes was probably most tasty mashed potato I've ever had.  Our friendly server introduced us to the many dessert options available and I found a few mouth watering. Sadly we were in a rush to get out to make a show so didn't get to the desserts. Spoiler alert: they have juniors cheesecakes from New York!  Will be back.",

I had the Diamond Cut and shared it with my mother (Sharing fee $15, but included additional salad). It was just enough food.  My uncle had to send his prime rib back. He asked for it to be medium rare and it was clearly rare.  So they grilled it a little longer and came back well done. Mine was perfectly rare, but looks like they need help with the temperatures of the meat.",

Nearly the first ones there, we were seated immediately. The service is impeccable and not at all pretentious.   The Old Fashioned was so delicious and made with love that I decided to partake in two.  I enjoyed a well-done luncheon cut, while my husband indulged with lobster and a much larger cut of prime rib. He claimed it was the best lobster he's ever had. We could cut both of our entrees with a butter knife- it was so tender and delicious.  There is something quite special about the croutons in the spinning salad- they don't get soggy!   Overall, the quality and service are just incredible. We're already making plans to return.  It was all so filling, that we decided against dessert. On our way out, the hostess asked if she could call a return taxi for us, but we elected to walk and burn it off. It really is just a quick walk from the strip.",

Lunch differs from dinner in that you order your drinks from the waitress but you order your food from the chef in the corner. You need to get up and order it there. It's arranged like a buffet corner where there's a big hunk of prime rib cooking. The chef cuts your prime rib and fixes your plate for you on the spot. You take it back to your table and then you activate BEAST MODE on your food.  We ordered the Lawry's Cut (thickest cut) with creamed corn and yorkshire pudding (a soggy but AMAZING piece of flavorful bread). Came out to about $26 per person. Super value, delicious, and great location. It's also much less crowded during lunch.",

I ordered roast beef slightly more than medium and was served slightly \"something\" more than well done.  It was bland and tasteless. The person sitting to my right ordered a ribeye steak. When he try to cut it,  it was so grizzled he returned it. The second steak was served nearly raw and equally grizzled. He asked that it be cooked a little bit more and the end result was no better than the  first effort. We were up charged believing that sides were served with the meal. Dinner for 6, with wine and cocktails, cost $142.00, inclusive of the gratuity per person. I think that the most offencive event was that the maitre d watched the second steak being served and didn't have the courtesy to note that it was raw and grizzled.  Give me a break --- avoid this place ---- they don't deserve the reviews they've received. A comparably price to dinner at Charlie Palmer's in the Four Seasons was superb.",

    "text": "This is a lunch review.   The Skinny: went in for lunch and it was totally good eats... Their pastrami sandwich is totally delish! (4) service: slightly disorganized in the beginning,  it got better by the end (3) value: come in for lunch... You won't regret it (4).  I have been craving a nice piece of medium rare prime rib for weeks. After incessant nagging, I finally convinced the hubs to take me to Lawry's for lunch.   I chose lunch because the prices seemed more reasonable and they had more variety of proteins to choose from (turkey/pastrami/Roast beef). Plus when you get the prime rib plate during lunch,  you get to try the creamed spinach and corn.   So we were seated promptly despite a large event occurring in the dining room. We showed our hostess our Lawry's VIP card. She told us to make our server knew about it so earned our points towards rewards dollars. (This was a triple point week... Score!)   We perused our menus and were waiting for a server. We waited. And waited. All the while,  other tables were going to the prime rib bar and getting food. I finally flagged down a waiter to ask him what the deal was and to put in a drink order.   He was surprised we didn't have a server yet but he explained that he would take our drink orders. He then told us during lunch, you line up at the prime rib bar and the carver will prepare sandwiches and prime rib plates.  If you want any other side items,  the server will take your orders. Your server will check in on you to see what you ordered from the bar and will start a check for you.   So we immediately head to the prime rib bar with the line of people putting in their orders.   The carver was quite efficient and we didn't wait long.   I got the luncheon prime rib plate which comes with mashed potatoes, creamed spinach/corn (or a bit of both) and Yorkshire pudding for $24. The hubs got a pastrami sandwich for $14 which comes with choice of bread (he got rye), chips, and condiment bar.   The hubs really loved his hand carved and trimmed pastrami sandwich. The pastrami was melt in your mouth good and the rye bread had a really perfect density to it. He thinks it may be the best pastrami he's had since Katz's deli in NYC which is saying a lot. He helped himself to the unlimited condiment bar where they had coleslaw(okay),  potato salad (okay), macaroni salad (okay),  marinated mushrooms (good), and marinated cucumber/tomatoes (good). They also had condiments as well such as slices of tomato, pickles, mustard,  etc.   My prime rib was pretty freaking delicious. Medium rare, I wolfed down the tender meaty goodness. I opted for half creamed corn and spinach. The creamed corn was unbelievably sweet with a nice bite to eat kernel. Creamed spinach was also very tasty. In comparison the mashed potatoes were rather lackluster (texture was too homogeneous and didn't have enough butter/milk to make it luxurious). Texturally , the Yorkshire pudding was also disappointing -  tough/dense and not crispy enough.   After we got back, our server came by and refilled our glasses of water promptly and kept them filled throughout our stay.   Polishing off our meals,  the hubs said \"I can't believe we missed out on so much for so long.\" Why indeed, why indeed (4 starred review)",

So I went into this feeling okay about it but came out feeling stuffed and great.  The prime rib was perfectly cooked and the sides, while sounding standard, with creamed corn and mash, was actually really excellent versions of those typical dishes.  The Yorkshire pudding was fun and maybe the only ho-hom moment was the spinning salad.  While it was fun to watch it being made, it was an over-dressed salad of normal lettuce.  Everything else was great, though.  The service was over-the-moon, as our waitress Diana was so nice, helpful with information and patient with us and the old school, Rat Pack feeling to Lawry's is fun to try in Vegas.

    "text": "I booked this location for our annual company dinner that being said this review will only cover large party service (60+)  The location is a few miles off the strip with valet parking. Lawry's boasts a very House of Prime Rib (San Francisco) look and feel.  Decorated in old school steakhouse fashion with dark woods and antique decor.  The staff is dressed in full uniform with the females wearing what looked like to me WWII nurse outfits complete with the little white hat.  I understand this is supposed to add to the charm of the location but for me it made me feel like I was in a hospital.  Our function was located in one of the two private rooms.  Lawry's has one room with fits up to 70 and another room for parties greater than 70.  I found the mismatched chairs at the tables odd and cheesy looking.  We had picked one of the set banquet options which included: appetizers, famous salad, bread, one vegetable, prime rib, chicken or salmon and dessert.  Upgrades for meat size, shrimp cocktails and lobster tails were also available.  The base price of this dinner was pretty reasonable in the $65 range per person.    The appetizers were quite good with chicken satay, mozzarella tomato skewers and mushroom bruschetta being served. Servers carried platters around to each table and visited each table at least three times.  A big part of the charm of Lawry's is the presentation ie the mixing of the salad and slicing of your prime rib from the huge rolling meat station.  Unfortunately since this was a big party we really didn't get to enjoy that aspect of the meal.  The creamed corn, mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding were all delicious.  The salad lacked flavor most likely the dressing was not strong enough.  Several people at our table ordered the lobster tail and they were all terrible.  We actually had to ask Lawry's to remove them from our tab as they were small chewy and just not fresh.  The prime rib was good but not great.  My 16 oz cut had way to much gristle making a large portion of it inedible.  Two people on my table ordered the 22 oz cut and they didn't look anything alike!  One cut being much larger than the other.  Desert was chocolate molten cake and it was so sweet I could not eat it.  Dinner also included tea, coffee or milk.  The coffee was strong and tasty.  For now I am assuming the quality of our meal was impacted by the fact we had a large banquet type service and rating this experience 3 stars. Overall the wait staff provided excellent drink and meal service and combined with Lawry's customer awards program this is a solid choice for your company function.",

My biggest complaint is about the salad...it was nasty...it looked and tasted like day old lettuce that had been seating around was tossed with veggies that I could not even identify...I had one bite and put my fork down...yuck! I have had better salads at Wendys.  I did not have dessert because I knew the bill was already higher than I wanted to pay.",

Lawry's does great sandwiches for lunch, from about $10 to $14.  It includes a small all you want fruit salad bar.  We went on a Monday, and had the Monday special prime rib sandwich for only $10.  The meat cutter slices a fresh slab of prime rib in front of your eyes, and slaps the meat on a heated bread roll.  The bread rolls aren't amazing, but good... the prime rib just melts in your mouth though!  I had a little horse radish with my prime rib sandwich, which gave it a nice little zing to it.  I thought the sandwich could have been a little bit larger, hence the 4 stars.  However, this is definitely a new spot for the work buddies and me.    Lawry's is actually a fast, cheap, and delicious lunch spot.  I definitely recommend this place for a quick work lunch if you are in the area, or have easy access to the I15.  Oh, and try the chocolate cookies for dessert.  They are almost like a cookie with a brownie stuffed inside.. only 2 for $1!",

I do not have another place in comparison at the moment. Everything I ate was fabulous!  You have the option of corn or cream of spinach with your prime rib, as well as you get mashed potatoes. And I would recommend the cream of spinach. It is simply amazing! You also have the option of seafood, which I choose one lobster tail (which I should have gotten 2).   The staff was very professional and accommodating and their VIP program is worth joining if you plan to dine there a few times a year. The table side carvery is a nice 'traditional' touch and lets you see exactly what you're getting. The table side salad prep is another long standing tradition, and the 'signature' salad was good, but nothing truly amazing about it. A good selection of wines that were reasonably priced (especially for Las Vegas) We'll be back soon!",

The decor was upscale and the staff  very friendly--they accomodated our table of 12 with ease.  Instead of separating us, or seating us at a rectangular table, we had the pleasure of sitting at a large round table. This was great because everyone could now converse with one another.  All the waitresses and carvers were fully clad in traditional attire--they all looked like busy pilgrims.  Everybody ordered their signature Prime Rib, but I opted for their 16 oz Bone-In Rib Eye. The meal was preceded by a salad that our waitress prepared in a very special way--she spun a metal bowl over ice, mixing in the salad and dressing as it rotated.  After everyone devoured their salad, the real feast began..  My eyes widened as I stared at the gargantuan plate of food set in front of me. The Rib Eye was HUGE! This slab of meat was cooked to perfection, slightly blackened on the outside, but tender and pink on the inside.  Instead of mashed potatoes, I received Au-Gratin Potatoes and  Crisp Fried Onions, which were much better than the traditional mashed spuds. I also had a few bites of their Prime Rib-- it was almost as delicious as my Rib Eye. The Prime Rib was moist and flavorful, but I preferred the smokier taste of the Rib Eye. Creamed Corn and Sauteed Mushrooms were the best dinner accompaniments one could ask for, definitely a must-have!   As for dessert....well,  I didn't have any. In fact, nobody did. This hearty feast left no room in our stomachs for dessert.",

    "text": "Sadly this is going to be a very mixed review.  Some good some, sadly, very bad:  Prime Rib, meh dry and not much flavor.  Cocktail perfect!, Waitress gets a \"D\", Carver and busboy both get an A+,  Bread, B.  Mushrooms A++, Uniforms, F- (really guys they look like goofy Halloween costumes.  First the good stuff:    My cocktail was perfect, the guy taking care of my water glass and keeping my table clean visited me more than my waitress.  I frankly I have never see a busboy more attentive, friendly and accommodating.  My carver was one of the best.  Young, on the job for only a month but man did he nail customer service.  He was honest without being pretentious, friendly but not fake and clearly enjoyed his role at Lawry's. It was clear that he was proud to be a Lawry's carver.  It is often recommended that you tip before he carves to bribe him into a bigger cut.  I tipped after the carve because he gave such great service.  Finally the Matre'd visited my table, greeted me by name and was genuinely interested in my experience.  I think Lawry's has outlived its brand.  I think it is fair to call Lawry's more of a cliche than a real brand.  I went by myself on a business trip to Las Vegas and wanted to see what was like, 50 years after I went to the original in LA for the first time.  I arrived early and was asked to sit for a few minutes.  When seated there wasn't a sole in the place.  After a very respectable period for someone to tend to my water glass the 60+ year old waitress in a costume out of the 50's appeared to take my drink order and deliver the menus (unceremoniously plopped onto the table).  I ordered a Perfect Manhattan which she was obviously trying to commit to memory.  After a couple of seconds she said \"ok, I will be right back with your Old Fashion\", I had to tell her again, Perfect Manhattan, then she said, ok I will be right back with your Manhattan.  Again I had to correct her by telling her I ordered a Perfect Manhattan.    To be fair the drink was flawless.  I mean this was a perfect, Perfect Manhattan.  So good I ordered two.  However, when she delivered my drinks she plopped them on the table out of my reach.  Whats that about?  Craziness with my waitress continued, she asked me twice if I wanted lobster, three times if I wanted a la carte veggies.  Frankly, it almost seemed like a party of one was more of an annoyance than anything.  She had a table of six across from me; to them she gushed.  I bet she visited their table 5 times for every one visit to my table.  The prime rib was dry and generally flavorless, the mashed potatoes were instant, the gravy out of a can, the spinning salad bowl is a joke with limp romaine and spinach on a cold plate; and the dressing out of a bottle.  I think at about covers it.  I travel on business and entertain and I am afraid it is time for this tired old Lady to hang up her dancing shoes.  You have seen better days.",

I can tell you that it did not disappoint. Gosh, it was tender and tasty. My creamed spinach I could not get enough of. I would say this is not like anyone else's prime rib is as the cuts are something else. I took the Lawry's cut which is petite, but the men had the larger ones and man that was a lot of meat on their plates. Our other lady friend had the Sea Bass and she was a very pleased. We had taken our own wine and so by the time I had few too many glasses I was in happy time. Therefore I really should not comment on the desert I had but I will.  Someone ordered me a strawberry cake.  I don't do strawberry at all, but I ate this like it was the best thing ever. So, not sure if it was the wine or possibly this cake was very much all that.  I left not a crumb on the plate. Our server was this wonderful Mom type lady who made us all feel like we were eating at home. Great atmosphere. I think if you are doing a group deal I recommend Lawry'. Here you will get great food and service.",

    "text": "Meh...  Went there on my wife's birthday because she wanted prime rib, and we were told this place had the best.  We both had the Lawry Cut, which for the price I expected to be some monster that I could never finish, nope, very average size, about 10 ounces I think.  At any rate, it was very tasty prime rib, but let's talk sides.  I expect a high-end restaurant to have high-end food, instead we are served some watery mashed potatoes that apparently came from box, topped with some low-end steak-house gravy.  The peas ($5 extra) seemed to be dumped straight from a can.  We're talking public school cafeteria grade sides.  The bill came to around $130 for 2 of us with the tip, and we didn't even have dessert or drinks.  Again, the prime rib was good, but this is Vegas, there is plenty of prime rib around, and many better places to eat for that kind of money.  If you have run out of places to eat, sure, give it a try, but we're still scratching our heads over whether or not we got royally screwed on that deal.",

We had show tickets and since they sat us late we were really concerned about missing the show.  But they sped up what is normally more of a \"dining experience\" into a pre-show meal, boxed up our leftovers, and we somehow made it on time to the show.  What more can I say?",

Wasn't too sure about this place when I drove by but then I whipped out my iPhone and opened my handy dandy Yelp app and sure enough there it was with all those reviews. Place is very nice outside and very clean both inside and out! Walked in and was greeting right away by the hostess. 5-10 min wait at 8pm on Saturday night. We got seated and within minutes our server comes over. Mrs.Taylor (who was the best server I have ever had in a long long long time) greeted us with open arms and explained how the whole place and ordering works. The bread and butter was so fresh crispy and tasty. The salad was very fresh and light and the dressing was pretty tasty. It was tossed table side which was interesting. Now to the prime rib. I ordered a 10 oz medium well. When it was cut and handed to me it was a little overcooked for my taste. Mrs Taylor actually spotted it and right away brought out a brand new one. It was much better. It was flavorful juicy and more. Potatoes were a little bland for my taste but with a little salt and pepper it was spot on. Overall Yelp didn't let me down. I love the old world charm of this place. From what the servers are wearing to the music to the old fashion cart cutting the meat. Please please ask for Mrs Taylor she is beyond awesome!",

Thinking it really would be a few minutes we waited in the lobby watching numerous parties being seated, many who arrived after us.  After 20 minutes we inquired as to the status and we were then told that our reservation was not until 8:00 pm but it was ok, we would be seated in a few minutes. At 8:10 we advised the hostess we were leaving and she said sarcastically, \"Thanks for being patient\". If when had arrived we had been told that our reservation was at 8:00pm and we would need to wait until then, we would have enjoyed a glass of wine the bar, instead our planned celebration at Lawry's was ruined.",

    "text": "Mmmm, so very good....  It's a beautiful restaurant, with a quaint 1950's glamor and style to it.  There is a complimentary valet parking, and there's a waiting room was plush with beautiful and immaculate furniture.  The host was very nice, and we were seating almost immediately.    The table was just the right size for our party of 6.  The waitress was a mature lady, dressed nicely, and was to be addressed as Mrs. Tremble, as she informed us.  She was very explanatory in all the aspects of their unique restaurant, and kindly offered us our drinks after a brief pause, giving us just enough time to consider what to order.    The service was very prompt, and the drinks were served nicely in beautiful glassware.  At some restaurants, the service sort of deteriorates if we don't order such things as appetizers, but Mrs. Tremble was gracious in everything we ordered and everything we didn't.    They started first with their famous spinning salad.  It was nothing short of stunning, and it was worth coming for just that.  Next they served the prime rib, sliced fresh at the table.  My cut was served perfectly at medium rare, and I had an order of the creamed spinach, which in my opinion wasn't quite as creamed as I'd have liked, but still really good.   The mashed potatoes were delicious, but not the best I've ever had.  The centerpiece here is clearly the prime rib, and here it did not disappoint.    The occasion was my brother's graduation from high school, and when the reservation was made, they asked immediately what the occasion was.  And after the meal was over, my brother was given a complimentary dessert, with \"Congratulations\" on the plate.    I'd highly recommend Lawry's for any special occasion, though it might be a little bit pricey to go without an occasion.  Give it a shot, but expect to pay a little under $50 a person.",

Where else can you eat at a fancy upscale establishment and walk away spending less than $50 a person...well, that's if you skip the wine and lobster sides.  Beef and service has always been consistent even between the different locations from LA to Chicago.  There's a lot of great steakhouses across the country but not many that specialize in prime rib.  Oh yeah..just to change up my usual dinner selection, they have a rib-eye portion that's basically a big chunk of prime they throw back on the grill to sear on both sides..WOW.  For steak, I'll go somewhere else..but prime..there is no other.   Don't forget, add creamed corn or spinach, your preference, both great.",

    "text": "Okay, so I came here for with my buddy during a night in Vegas and although the steak and service was awesome, it didn't have the two guys hanging out type of atmosphere. The place was very exquisite and felt very posh, but at the same time seemed more of a \"date\" or anniversary or even a milestone birthday sort of a vibe. Not a place for two guys to just chow down on some fresh beef, killing a few pitchers of beer and laughing it up.   We had reservations so we waited less than 5 minutes while they made sure our table was properly ready. The dining room is a very tall one story high volume (at least 25' high) area with crown molding and soft lighting everywhere. When they sat us in our high backed curved booth, they literally pulled the table out so we could be seated and then pushed the table back in. Once they knew we were going to have prime rib and steak (as if we came here for a salad), they brought out this huge rolling cart that was domed. Under the dome was a mountain of actual various choices of meat that we could get. My prime rib looked succulent and ready to jump in my belly; my bros steak had just the right amount of marbling for that juicy taste. They tagged the pieces we selected and rolled the cart away towards the kitchen. When the steaks came out, the tender meat seemed to jump onto my fork and just melt in my mouth. I've been to other steak houses and this was one of the best pieces of meat I've had (outside of Texas). The sides were awesome as well; the potatoes, the mac n cheese, the creamed spinach, the bread ... all great. And the drinks were great too; we had a few beers as well as a couple glasses of scotch and finished off with a simple rum and coke.   Overall, the food and service were outstanding but it was the more formal atmosphere that kept the dining experience from falling off the charts.",

From the time we were greeted at the door to catching a cab and everything else in between, I must say it was an excellent experience.  We started at the bar (where else would you start, HA!) and then we were walked over to a comfy table.  I didn't know what to expect but our awesome waiter walked us thru.  We began with the famous spinning salad (not that impressive).  I wanted white wine and he recommended this half bottle of...yikes, I forgot the name?  When ordering, he looked at me and automatically said the California cut (smaller cut) while my friend had the Lawry cut (traditional).  The dinner included the salad, yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, & whipped cream horseradish.  We also shared a serving of lobster tails and creamed corn - yummylicious!!  Even with the smaller cut, I could not finish my plate.  The servings are so HUGE!!   The food deserves 4 stars and the service deserves 10 stars! The staff was so personable and I loved our waiter.  He was AWESOME!!!  Great conversation, served food at a good pace, and very attentive.   Definitely a must go when visiting vegas.",

Have been to Lawry's in both Vegas and LA a few times over the years... and always a good meal.  But this time... not so much.  I have prime rib... and it was good but not great.  Wife had the turkey dinner... which was mediocre and wasn't served with all the sides (missing the cranberries) and by the time we got a visit from our server... meal was pretty much done.  Also ordered the pumpkin pie... it was horrible.  On the bright side... the kids got to eat in a classy restaurant for their first time (ages 8 and 5) and did fine... but wouldn't consider this place kid friendly.  Several close calls with the drinks in tall glasses.",

Lawry's Vegas easily has the best prime rib I've ever had (and trust me, I've had lots).  I've also found that the Vegas Lawry's is much better and more consistent compared to the LA one (the original Lawry's).  Great service from the moment you pull up and hand you keys to the valet.  They always treat us like royalty even though many times we're stanky from a couple rounds of golf or are hauling around a drunk bachelor dressed as Elvis (complete with painted on sideburns).  We do however have some rules of etiquette when we go to Lawry's.    1. EVERYONE must get the Bowl cut (all 32 boneless ounces of it) 2. NO ONE is allowed to order it cooked more than Med-Rare 3. ANYONE that doesn't finish it pays for everyone else's meal",

    "text": "Amazing amazing prime rib that melts in your mouth!  When you walk into this restaurant, it's like a trip back in time.  The decor does not look like it has changed since their earlier days.  They did a great job keeping up the quality of the decor.  The waitressing staff wears the same attire from the late 1950's.  Our waitress was a pleasant older lady wearing something crossed between a french maid and a waitress.  My husband and I both ordered the California Cut that came with yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes.  We also ordered the cream corn and asparagus.  Our salad was simple with a delicious french dressing (which I usually do not like french dressing- but this one was tasty and refreshing).  It also came with pickled beets that I surprisingly enjoyed.  She hand spun our salad table side which was nice because she gave us a quick history of the restaurant and we learned where the recipe for yorkshire pudding originated.    The master carvers pushed their huge  shiny metal carts to our table.  Ours in particular was wearing a shiny gold medallion around his neck indicating that he completed a master carving school.  LOL This meant we would be guaranteed a perfect cut of prime rib.  I found all this presentation impressive and slightly comical, but Oh Boy did our master carver deliver.  He executed our cuts tableside.  Our prime rib cut was delicious and plentiful drenched in perfect gravy.  They serve on the side 2 Lawry's seasonings and 2 horseradich options.  I preferred the strong one that makes your nostrils burn (so good).  The mashed potatoes were very creamy.  My first bite of the prime rib was heavenly and I could almost hear the heralds singing.  Then I tried the yorkshire pudding which is like a soft but perfectly browned bread pudding/roll.  The proper way to eat it is by dipping it in the meat juices/gravy.  This was so delicious.  This is my first experience with yorkshire pudding.  I never really knew what it was & I am so glad I have experienced it finally at the age of 32.  Wow I was missing out!  The creamed corn was cream and well made.  The asparagus was perfectly steamed and not too soft.    We went there for our 5th wedding anniversary.  A nice surprise at the end was when they brought out a beautiful strawberry cheesecake.  It was perfectly creamy & topped of our after dinner sweet tooth nicely.  I found this very thoughtful and left a great impression.    I woke up the next day wanting more Prime Rib from Lawry's.  I cannot wait for my next trip back.  I will hopefully check out the LA location in the future.",

I actually felt bad that they had to wear that getup.   If you're a huge prime rib fan, this place will probably satisfy your craving. Various cuts ranging from small to omgwtf was I thinking when I ordered this. I ordered the largest cut they offered, it was supposedly 22oz. It was pretty good. I couldn't finish my sides after eating that, and I didn't really get a chance cause some guy took my plate without even asking. That cream spinach was 6 bucks and I had 2 spoonfuls. The salad that comes with the meal was pretty good. Probably the best croutons I've ever had.   The wine list was pretty pathetic.   Overall, the quality and price is reasonable.",

Walked right in and had a table in 3 minutes.  Ambience is slightly upscale.  The men were dressed like you'd expect in the main dining room of a cruise ship.  The waitresses looked matronly, primarily because of their matronly uniform.  I guess the costume is some sort of a maid's uniform, which included a white cap.  I did not laugh to myself because they, and the rest of the establishment was indeed fairly classy.  No teenagers worked here.    I had a salad, med-rare prime rib, creamed corn, spinach, and  Yorkshire pudding.  Yorkshire pudding is a special bread that you dip your remaining au-juice and other juices off your plate with.  The salad came with a house dressing that seemed to be a mixture of catalina/tomato and french.   The dressing was light and not very thick at all.  The waiter did NOT ask me what kind of dressing I want, so that might be all there was.  but it was sooooo good!  The dinner also  came with sourdough bread and butter.  Don't let the name \"creamed corn\" turn you off.  It's not the stuff you pour out of a can at home.  It really is very good.  Although the prim rib itself is very, very good, it really is no better than places such as The Outback and Texas Roadhouse.  So go for the ambience, or spinach, creamed corn.  If not, go somewhere cheaper.     Because of the ambience, creamed corn and spinach, I will be back!  (For sure.)",

    "text": "Lawry's is the best prime rib Las Vegas has to offer, period.   @ Prime Rib - You come here for the prime rib. They have a variety of cuts ranging in different prices. in terms of price, the beef bowl is the best bang for your buck, IF you can finish the 24 oz (w/ bone) of prime rib goodness for $49. The Lawrys cut is around 10oz of prime rib for $36.  The best for most people.The California cut is around 6oz for $32. Not worth it unless you have a small appetite. It may be worthwhile to just share a beef bowl if you're planning on doing a California + Lawrys cut. There are more cuts, but I think these are the only cuts you should be interested.  Also, you must get rare or medium rare. It just makes the carver sigh if you order any other temperature of meat. If you don't eat your meat red, you really have to try it just once. Its worth it.  @ Bread - Good bread is the type of bread that makes you keep grabbing more before your delicious prime rib comes out. This would have been the case if I wasn't getting a beef bowl.  @ Spinning Bowl Salad - Being the guy I am, I really don't like my greens. But this salad was very fresh and just good. Spinning your food before eating must make everything taste better!  @ Yorkshire Pudding - This is actually bread. People seem to love this, I don't. This is more of a personal preference though.  @ Mash Potatoes - This is really the only disappointing item. It just lacks flavor and just doesn't have the nice smooth mash potatoes texture that I want. I love mash potatoes, so this was a big deal for me. My favorite mash potatoes is the one at Cheesecake Factory, and they give you mountains of that stuff! Yum  Besides the prime rib, one of the strongest key points is the attention to detail. Service is top notch. The wait staff is very friendly and very attentive. You're treated like a king or queen here. The first time you come here, you'll be awed by the presentation of the spinning bowl salad. They also provided you a cold fork just for your salad. Drinks are refilled fast. If you have leftovers, they package everything for you. Lastly, if you babies in your party, they provide you stands for the baby car seats. All of this attention to detail is what separates those 4 star and 5 star restaurants.   This is a nice restaurant, so try to dress appropriately. However, they really don't enforce any dress code. I did come in shorts, a t-shirt, and flip flops and they didn't seem to mind. I did feel like I was underdress though.  If a cute girl wants to go to Lawrys, you take her here. No excuses. There is no substitution in Vegas. The smile in her face at the end of the meal will be worth the price you pay.  Other than the mash potatoes, I have zero complaints about this place. I want to give this place a 5 star for the great prime rib, service, and attention to detail, but the disappointing mash potatoes just won't let me give this place a 5 star.   P.S. Don't bet that you finish 2 beef bowls, you won't. Trust me on this.",

Especially a wedding reception where you know it would require people to speak and have music to dance? Absolutely disgusted that you gave no warning prior, no solution during and no acceptable resolution after. Management should be ashamed. You guys took a special occasion and ruined it. Even in the wedding video you can clearly hear the distortion from the opening prayer to every speech from the parents and all the loved ones of the bride and groom. There's no way to fix the audio in the wedding video and no way to recreate those moments. Everytime the bride and groom watch their wedding video they will hear nothing but static. You guys are horrible for doing this to people. Plus, have your chef learn the difference between medium rare and well done.",

Great food: you won't get a better prime rib.  Anywhere.  The sides are equally as delicious and the creamed corn is a must.  The add on lobster tails were a bit small, but made up for it in taste.    Great ambiance:  While the restaurant in Beverly Hills is a bit more dressy, in Vegas you can dress up or down.  Just don't come in shorts or tank tops.  It seemed a bit slow for a Saturday night, but Vegas did in general.  Tough times for everyone it seems.  We still made a reservation just in case.  Price: Worth every penny!",

    "text": "Before I start with this review I have to say that my expectations were extremely high because I've heard so much about this place.  Lawry's was very good, don't get me wrong, but it is a lot of fattening food in an odd way of serving it.    The server was super friendly.  I think her name was Michelle.  I don't know why because I have the worst memory ever but that name comes to me.  The potatoes were great and the prime rib was delicious.  The outfits had to go though because it negates any ambiance that the place could possess.  It really does alter the feel of the place.  The creamed corn - I was unimpressed!  It wasn't BAD, it's just that not only have I had better (at maestro's), I found a recipe online that blows this creamed corn away.  It was too thick almost like it had been sitting on a burner.    All in all, the food was very delicious, just not something I could eat on a regular basis!",

    "text": "One of my all time Favorites! I've been here quite a number of times including the one in Beverly Hills.   The 'Spinning Bowl Salad' is one of the best salads I've ever had, their house dressing is exceptional.   I always order the 'Lawry Cut' cooked medium-medium well and ask for bone-in (it just seems to have a bit more flavor, not that it needs anymore). The prime is fork tender, juicy and just right.   For the sides, I love the creamed corn (melts in your mouth) and  the mashed potatoes (so creamy good). The Yorkshire pudding just soaks up some of the savory au jus sitting on the bottom of the plate and occsionally taking pieces off in between bites of the prime just compliments it greatly. I also want to mention that adding a bit of their mild horseradish condiment with the prime brings a another layer of creamy flavor that I must say is beyond delicious!  In regards to the ambiance, the place resembles an extra large dining area of a mansion with servers dressed in maid outfits standing by at your service.",

    "text": "We used to come here a lot and I don't know why we stopped going. Maybe the fact that there are thousands (?) of restaurants in Vegas has something to do with it. They do have the best prime rib so whenever somebody has a craving for it then we go.  The prime rib dinner comes with mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, Spinning Bowl salad and horseradish. You pick the size of meat you want (from smallest to biggest, $38-59): California Cut, English Cut, Lawry Cut, Diamond Jim Brady Cut and the Beef bowl Cut.  You can get additional sides if you want like mushrooms, creamed corn, creamed spinach, peas, shrimp cocktail and asparagus.  They also serve ribeye steak and lobster tail. For dessert, they have sticky toffee pudding, Key Lime pie, ice cream, hot fudge sundae, creme brulee, cheesecake, coconut banana cream pie, chocolate pear upside down cake and chocolate lava cake.  Prime Rib Dinner: They make the Spinning Salad in front of you.  A meat carver pushes cart of prime rib at your table and you pick what cut and doneness you want. I normally get a medium rare California Cut prime rib dinner and get additional sides of creamed corn, spinach and lobster tail. Their prime rib is tender and juicy they only give you a butter knife! I use Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes to soak up some of the au jus. 4/5  Sticky Toffee Pudding: Warm bread pudding with warm toffee caramel sauce with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side and a dollop of whipped cream. It's a pretty big slice you might want to share with another person. It's not drowning in sauce and with sticky toffee pudding, I do like a lot of sauce. 3.5/5  Chocolate Lava Cake: Chocolate cake with hot chocolate ganache inside with raspberry sauce, whipped cream and chocolate flakes. This is ok. Nothing special. 3.5/5",

I said, we need to eat somewhere that we can only eat in Vegas.  I didn't know that the restaurant was so upscale and that there was a required dress attire.  We were wearing shorts, button down shirts, and flipflops but were not turned away.      For a couple you can expect to pay about $150 for dinner.  I had prime rib and the wife had the beef Wellington. Both pieces of meat were extraordinarily amazing!!!!  We had the cream spinach and Yorkshire puddings as extra sides.  My wife who is British loved the Yorkshires and the Wellington all the same!  We could have gone down the street to Fogo but there were a few items that catered to the British taste.  We were both impressed and happy with the quality of food and service.",

Since it's prime rib, everything is done a little bit more, which means that I got a nice and pink rare slice. The sides were REALLY delicious. The prime rib comes with the mashed potatoes, but there is an extra cost for the creamed corn and creamed spinach. Both are fantastic and I loved it, but just know that it will add to your bill.  The ambiance is nice with the waitstaff in costume. It feels pretty homey and would be a nice place to go if you want some steak but wan't an atmosphere that is different from the casinos and the strip.",

We came on a Friday for lunch around 12:30, it was quiet and not busy at all. The lunch prices were definitely a lot cheaper. We ordered the English cut- their thin sliced prime rib. the waitress told us it was also one of her favorites because it melts in your mouth tender. She was right! The best cut ever, and with three pieces plus sides, it was more than enough food. The only exception for lunch is no salad, but you can order that a la crate. Only $26 for our cut was definitely a deal for lunch. I knocked off one star because I prefer a baked potato rather than mash with creamed spinach and creamed corn. It made it all seem too mushy. Also the Yorkshire pudding could've been bigger. Over all the dining experience and place was very nice.",

    "text": "I really had high hopes coming here this evening as after a cross country plane ride, 18 holes of golf in blistering heat, we headed out to feed 8 hungry hombres with a big side of beef from Lawry's \"THE PRIME RIB\"..  Rolling in the place is very nice with a large spacious room, high celings and booths adorning the sides of the place we are seated in circular table for 8 of us and immediately it is too hot and ask for the air to be turned on.  It came on brieflly but for the rest of the night it was quite warm in here. Female servers are dressed in old Southern times complete with very authentic looking outfits.   wine list was over priced but we found a nice value and went through 6 bottles before we were one.   Menu is very basic with each of your entrees coming with small side of Mashed Potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, and a tossed house salad which is with egg, crouton, beets, in a french dressing.    If you wanted dressing other than the french than they gave you choices but it was not a hand spun salad just the lettuce with dressing poured over it.   Obviously Prime rib is brought to table in large rolling heated thing where they cut your piece to order based on size temperture and preferance. 7 Went with the various cuts of prime rib while one person opted for the Rib Eye.  Start with the Rib Eye... It was OK... really nothing to write home about and certainly not with the price points.    The 7 Prime Ribs of Various shapes, size and Cuts were in short TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING.  The Prince Lawry or King something cut was 16 Ounce bone in $57.00   while the Lawry cut was $44.00 for 10 Ozs.  Either way you slice it each cut was tough period.  I have had better at weddings where they are serving 100 pieces of prime rib at time.  No way about it not one good piece of meat in the bunch.   Server kept pushing sides... small scoop of spinach which was terrible $3.00 while $3.00 got you a spoonful of creamed corn that was very good.  $10.00 for wild 'Sizzling Mushrooms well they werent sizzling and the shoe string onion rings $10.00 were ice cold if not tasty.  Passing on desert and coffee, I simply could not have been more disappointed as this place failed on just about every level.   Tempted to give it 1 star but service was good and people were friendly but honestly this was an epic failure.",

In slacks and white long sleeves I experienced a leisurely, pleasant, nearly 2hr lunch in nice quiet surroundings. Expertly served by Mrs. Leavitt, who should be THE prime example of perfect Lawry's waitstaff.  The food--crispy artichoke hearts and mangoes for starters...then the luncheon cut Prime Rib from the carver's cart, mashed potatoes and yummy creamed corn, the sides.  Mixed the mild and zingy horseradish together by Mrs. Leavitt's suggestion. Good suggestion.  My wife had two good cocktails.  I was happy with S. Pelligrino sparkling water.  We split a piece of Coconut Banana Creme pie. Huge piece. Good suggestion, Mrs. L.       Coffee with dessert.  Good ending.",

    "text": "For those who have an itinerary to stick to... Seated at 7:05. Appetizers served at 7:40. Salad at 8:10. Prime rib at 8:30. Left at 9:10.  I now know what they mean when they say, \"The meat will melt in your mouth.\"  Looking for self parking? Nahh, they rather have you tip the valet guys. My company for the night was a wonderful friend of mine. The reservation was made at 730 so we got in earlier to try and get out quicker for the rest of the nights activities (good thing we did too). Our table was not ready and they said the next available one would be for us so we hung out at the bar by the entrance at 6:45. Wish I got the bartenders name but he is the founder of and did a wonderful job on my girl's extra sweet Raspberry Lemon Drop. I stuck with the Mule and a glass of Rodney Strong red wine. My highlights here was the food itself. Shrimp Cocktail was very fresh and had a soft/crunch kind of like biting into a pear is the best way I can describe it haha. Didn't like the Salad, it was too dry and needed more flavor. They should offer more dressing or cheese as an addition. As all the other reviews state, the Prime Rib is fantastic. Our Diamond (16oz) and Lawry's (10oz) Cut came out very juicy and cooked perfectly to my medium rare expectations. The mushrooms and asparagus were great, but something new for me that night was the Yorkshire Pudding. You could make this stuff with a side of Au Jus an Appetizer itself!  I would love to give this restaurant it's 5th star although unless you have endless topics to discuss, service should not have taken so long.",

    "text": "Went to Lawry's recently for restaurant week and boy was it an experience! This was my first time there and the entire dinner was pleasant from start to finish.   SERVICE - Complimentary valet parking (they force you to valet), the guys are quick and courteous - Reservations desk and hosts were very quick, friendly, and accommodating. We made reservations via OpenTable and had no trouble getting seated right on time. - Our waitress was friendly, almost jovial, and thoroughly explained everything that arrived at our table. I just find it odd that the server uniforms look very similar to housekeeping, which I'm sure is to maintain the classic vibe. However, the hosts wore crisp black suits and looked much more modern. The clash of styles was interesting to see.  FOOD - For restaurant week, we got the set dinner for $50.15. It came with the spinning salad, 6 oz. California cut prime rib with broiled lobster, mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding; creme brulee, and choice of coffee or tea. We ordered a side of creamed corn as well.  - The spinning salad had a creamy sauce that had a strong kick of mustard. The beets and extra crispy croutons made it for me. Otherwise, it's a pretty simple and gimmicky starter salad. - The prime rib was carved right in front of us. I got a rare and it seemed a little more medium rare. I also ran out of au jus before the meat was done. - The broiled lobster tail came with half a lemon and melted butter. It was a tad dry but well-seasoned. - The mash with gravy was standard. The Yorkshire pudding was fairly plain but added a nice change of texture to the dish. - There were two choices of horseradish included with the prime rib. There is straight horseradish, which is incredibly strong and heads straight for your nasal passage. Then there is a horseradish cream mixture that was too mild. I mixed the two and found it to be the perfect balance. - The creamed corn was sweet and delicious. - The creme brulee was pretty basic, as was the included coffee. To be honest, the meal was so heavy that I couldn't even get through half of the creme brulee. - I just love Lawry's seasoning salt (for the prime rib) and pepper (for the salad). They really enhanced both respective dishes!  AMBIENCE Entering Lawry's transported me to another time and place, where people swing-danced instead of twerk and cell phones were an afterthought of science fiction novels. It has a very classy feel. Everything is plush and comfortable and makes you feel high-class despite the \"resort casual\" dress code. I am under the impression that many customers come here for special occasions (we were asked if our dinner was a special occasion just about 6 times). I would say this makes a classy and lowkey romantic date spot. Who doesn't like delicious prime rib?   I would not go here often as the price is a bit steep. But if I'm ever ballin' and craving prime rib, Lawry's is where you'll find me!",

But let's talk about just the food and only the food.  Overpriced is one word that comes to mind. Tiny and thin are another too. Bland is also a word that comes to mind.  The prime rib was perfectly cooked. However, it was incredibly thin. One of the thinnest slices of prime rib I have ever seen. The au jus and horseradish were just fine. Nothing notable about them. The mashed potatoes were incredibly bland. Even with the gravy on top of them, they were incredible bland. The salad was fine. Again, nothing notable about it.  Did I really just spend so much money on a dinner that tasted low end? Sadly so. I'm not sure what the draw is for this place when there are so many prime rib specials to be had all over Vegas. And frankly, those way cheaper specials will be a hell of a lot tastier than here.",

    "text": "On our occasional visits to Las Vegas over the years we have made it a point to dine at Lawry's ever since a colleague introduced us to this place many moons ago.  We love the prime rib, decor, and the service - as well as the rolling steam table with service tableside - it's great, and a special treat these days.  The sides are always delicious, too.  The side salad, freshly prepared, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, sauteed mushrooms, popovers, are all delicious and great quality.   On this visit, (8PM reservation on a Friday evening) I ordered the Beef Wellington \"to try it\" and it was very tasty, generously portioned, and came with a very nice potatoes au gratin and nice mushroom sauce.  It was great but in the future I think I will stick to the Prime Rib - the main reason Lawry's steakhouses are so successful, after all:-)  Also, our server quickly and professionally averted disaster, as he'd had the carver serve my husband his Prime Rib before my plate had come from the kitchen.  When they walked away, I knew we were counting the seconds until I got my plate and my husband (ever the gentleman!) could start eating.  As it happened, the second the server arrived with my plate and my husband's Yorkshire Pudding, he took one quick look at my husband and said, \"Let me make you a fresh plate\", and my husband replied, \"Thanks for making things right!\"  We finished off with the famous Banana Cream Pie and hot coffee.  A delightful end to our meal.  The valet was very friendly and helpful, too, in calling us a cab after dinner.  One special note:  There is a sign at the entrance which suggest \"appropriate attire\" - as it should be.  Lawry's is a special place with a great dining experience.  However, we noticed LOTS of guests in novelty T-shirts, cut offs, and flip flops. It really detracts from the dining experience.  And another interesting observation - the folks exiting the restaurant and driving cars were nicely dressed - the car thing makes me think that most of them were local residents.  The \"sloppily\" dressed guests were bring picked up - making me think they were tourists.  As a tourist myself - a suggestion:  Folks, when visiting Las Vegas  Lawry's - show a little class with the wardrobe selections, okay?  And everyone should know, other than that, it was a very good experience.  We will definitely return again.",

Don't come here for anything else. Serious! Actually...come here for the creamed corn too. Soooo perfect paired with the juicy meaty prime rib! Order the Lawry's cut or bigger and you must get it medium rare or lose my number!   The service is top notch and the shiny silver meat cart is super old school and unique. I love that they carve and serve the prime rib tableside. They also offer a salad spinning production tableside as well. Try not to blink your eyes or you'll miss all of the tasty action.   We made reservations effortlessly on opentable on New Years Eve 2017. We were also running 30 minutes late, but the restaurant still accommodated our party with no problems at all. This restaurant is perfect for the last meal of the year because they deck the space with festive New Year party favors. Our table left the evening with horn blowers, hat's, tiaras and festive party necklaces.  It was a memorable dining experience and I would recommend it for any special occasion!  Thanks for picking up the tab Jeff V! $300+++ for a party of 4 is no bargain feat.",

Food is a little bland as it needed salt and we were not fans of the spinning salad dressing. Maybe if they offered a choice upfront would remedy that issue. I would recommend Lawry's again.

It goes from debutant to Andre the Giant. All of it magnificent with au ju and tender beyond belief. The spinning salad is a novelty that is well presented even though I was sure it would be dated by this tome it was still wonderfully received. The pour a stiff drink here too.

I had such high hopes for Lawry's since it's the same premise and they are also supposed to be well known for their prime rib. Sadly, it just didn't measure up at all.  The restaurant is super old school, with lots of wood and large booths. Our server was nice and explained everything since we were newbies. All prime rib dinners come with their spinning salad bowl, bread, mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding and horseradish. Creamed corn and spinach are extras here, while they are included at HOPR.   We ended up with two lawry's cut and one ribeye. One of the lawry's cuts came with a bone, while the other didn't. Not sure why. The 24 oz. ribeye was massive, and came with a huge pile of friend onions and scalloped potatoes. I thought both the mashed potatoes and prime rib were pretty bland. Had to add salt to both. The prime rib was just ok, not as tender or flavorful as I was expecting. Also, the creamed spinach wasn't very creamy and lacked flavor too. Overall, I think Lawry's is ok for the price, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here.",

    "text": "Lawry's is hands-down the best place to get prime rib. They have carved-to-order Prime Rib roast beef from a large custom metal cart that they wheel to your table. All the cuts are good size-right California is the smallest but still huge to Beef Bowl Cut that should feed 6 but you see a few people tackle it.     We always try to get there a bit early and have a drink in the bar to relax before dinner. They have a fully stocked bar with great drink specials. There is a Prime Time (Happy Hour) in the bar Monday through Friday from 4-6pm with half off bites and specialty drinks. My husband had a glass of Cabernet and I had Freixenet Cava. They bring around freshly fried potato chips that are amazing. They also have the 'bites' from $3 to $18 with two different sandwiches at $10 (a prime rib and a turkey); selected oysters are $3 each and lobster bruschetta tops out at $18. The wine and cava were just $5 each-with a generous pour. This price is only for the bar so order another before you go to the dining room. The bar is so pleasant and the deals at Prime Time so good, it would be fun just to have dinner in the bar on the Prime Time Menu.   Prime Rib dinners (and most other dinners) come with their signature spinning salad bowl prepared tableside by a server who spins a large metal bowl of greens on a bed of ice. The salad dressing, a \"Vintage classic dressing with sherry wine\", tastes to me like a cross between 1000 Island and French dressing. This year, we had the Blue Cheese Salad dressing instead. I never thought about it before but asked this year if they had others and they said yes!   The Prime Rib dinners also come with wonderfully creamy mashed potatoes & gravy and Yorkshire Pudding (amazing either savory dipped in gravy or when drizzled with honey).  They also have fish and a vegetarian option. This year, I had the 3 lobster tails. They were small but had good flavor although the orzo was over cooked and the seasoning was so strong that it interfered with the taste of the lobster-it actually tasted like cloves. And I don't care for cloves. There are also lots of sides from creamed corn or spinach, crispy fried onions to scalloped potatoes. All great.   We go to Lawry's to celebrate special occasions. This time it was my husband's birthday. We often go for our wedding anniversary because the ambiance is so special. They brought out a bundt pumpkin spice cake with whipped cream-so tasty!   Lawry's is not cheap but you get a huge amazing meal that is so special that you will enjoy the memories all year.",

These past 2 thanksgivings have been celebrated at my sisters in Vegas and we've catered the thanksgiving food from Lawry's (Beverly Hills and Vegas location) for years.  This year later thanksgiving, we arrive to pick up our prime-rib, gravy and other yummy things.  Pick up at the side of the building, where the valet parking lot is at.  Get there, give the attendant our name... waiting... waiting... I start chatting with other customer who's also just standing by their cars waiting... an older gentleman told me he's been waiting for 25 minutes already, and he's only picking up food for 8 people.  Hmmm, that means I'll have to wait for 2 hours since I'm picking up for 30.   40 minutes later one of the guys comes out with a cart with my prime rib. Finally!  What's taking so long!? I called 2 hours prior to pick up just to give em a heads up. Why is every single person waiting for such a long time!?  I so badly want to give this Lawry's 5-stars, but this wait just killed it. There is no point of ordering days in advance if everyone will have to stand around for 30 minutes in order to pick up their food.   The food and all was good as always, the wait killed 2 stars off this review. Hope they'll do better next thanksgiving, if not I'll consider catering from a different place.",

The lunch portions of prime rib are $26 and you get a choice of mashed potatoes with corn OR creamed spinach. I decided to go with the creamed spinach because I love the creamed spinach from House of prime rib. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as creamy and needed some salt. The prime rib, however was absolutely perfect! It was tender, juicy, and melt in your mouth delicious!",

I went in for lunch as its a better value--the same cuts are offered as dinner, but you get the addition of a vegetable with the lunch plates.  My server was very efficient at pacing the meal.  I spent the extra coin for the famous \"spinning bowl salad\".  The salad build was excellent.  I was a little disappointed in the dressing; no particular flavor stood out to me.  With my meal, I selected the creamed corn.  This is real creamed corn--nothing at all like what you get out of the can.  Real cream and deliciousness in every bite.  The master carver stopped by my table and did a nice job slicing some good pieces of meat to my specifications.  The raw horseradish is far better than the cream sauce.  A lot more punch and a better complement overall.    I'll know this for next time--my OCD kicked in when everything was served one a single plate.  Next time, I'll request the sides to be plated separately and perhaps request no gravy.",

I think he found his favorite place - Lawry's.  I heard this place first time from Food Network and I'm always curious how good it is.  This time when we go to Vegas, we finally tried it.  I love using Open Table App to make reservation.  Not only it's free and fast, but also I can change the time even 1 hour before the reservation as long as it's still available.  (You gotta have this App on your Smart phone, every 500 points is $5 Cheque)    The price is different by the size, we all got the Lawry's cut (16oz).  Mashed potato, tossed spining salad and the pudding bread are free with the meal.  The bread is SOOOO good!  If I had more stomach that night, I would have order extra and take it to go.  We also ordered the sizziling mushrooms which is a little too greasy to me.  It tastes very good cuz there's a lot of butter in it.  The creamed corn is the bomb, best combination with the prime rib.  Creamed spanish is also pretty good, not too creamy, lots of spanish.  Overall, this is the BEST PRIME RIB restaurant we have every had.  My husband already told me this is the MUST EAT place everytime when we go Vegas.  Screw the buffet!!!  $39 is so worth it!",

I have eaten at this place 2 times, once last year, and the year before that. Both times all I can remember is being stuffed full, and taking home leftovers both times!   The atmosphere puts you back to the turn of the 20th century times a bit. It definitely gets filled up, so holding conversations do become a little difficult when it gets noisy.  You are brought out a salad which is mixed, spun, and served all table side. For the Prime Rib (which is MOST recommended to order from the menu, as they are famous for it here). You get served table side - and are offered a choice of wellness done. All carved and served table side from a fancy rolling serving cart, and you are allowed to pick your sides which are also on the cart. You are served Yorkshire pudding to help mop up the extra gravy bits.   The meat - is melt in your mouth. So tender and full of flavor! You get two varieties of horseradish - hot or creamed - both full of zest and good bite.  I don't remember all the details from here - since it has been such a long while coming here, but the service you get is great! The staff are very pleasant, and aiming to please in every aspect.  So definitely another top notch place to eat.",

I like the ambience of their restaurant, to the demeanor of all their servers.  You'll enjoy watching the ladies spin and toss your salad right in front of your eyes...I'm talking about edible green salad for all you dirty minded folks.  Now get your mind out of the gutter and focus on the food.  The salad dressing is good, and leaves me wanting more all the time.  I normally get the hubby to hand over his salad, or I take a few bites here and there from the parents.  The sides are all amazing!    LIke I said when I first started this review, Lawry's prime rib is melt in your mouth goodness, seriously.  Now, I like horseradish.  I failed to trust the staff.  When you're told that \"this creamy horseradish is mild, & that horseradish is HOT\" you should believe them.  I took a bite of my prime rib where I just put some of \"that\" horseradish on and nearly had a stroke.  My mouth literally fell off my face like Mr. Potato Head's.  I had to take several \"moments\" to get a grip, a grip on my hubby's knee and squeeze it to death it was so hot.  By the time the horseradish heat disappeared, hubby lost both lower extremities.  J/k.  Seriously though, hot stuff.    You can't miss with Lawry's.  If you haven't already, go grab a Lawry's seasoning in a grocery store near you!  =o)",

    "text": "Lawry's is a super awesome prime rib mecca in Las Vegas, and after living here over 10 years, I was finally able to see what all the fuss is about last Friday. It is about a LOT!  We took advantage of their April email deal ... Dinner for two for $99, which includes their usual spinning salad, prime rib (only 8 oz.) with all the usual sides, a bottle of their house wine, and even little chocolate sundae's and coffee at the end.  Things that blew me away that usually don't:  1. Sourdough bread to start. Sure, its just sourdough bread, but at Lawry's they serve it warm, fresh and with ramekins of fresh buttah. Oh yeah. 2. Yorkshire pudding.  Cooked perfectly, fun to eat, and the perfect leftover gravy/au jus vehicle. Dayaaaam! 3. Creamed corn.  Most steakhouses serve adequate creamed corn, but Lawry's creamed corn was spot on, yellow nibblets of utter deliciousity. So fresh tasting and each kernal popped in my mouth just right. Wow. Good stuff you guys. 4. Coffee.  Don't you love it when they serve you coffee in those mini silver coffee pots? I DO!  And the coffee I ordered to go with my dessert was super fresh tasting, smooth, and truly satisfying.  One other detail that impressed me, was the fact that they have a sign in the reception area politely asking men to remove their hats while in the dining room.  I loved that.   Since I am enjoying the 2nd half of my 1st century here on earth (i.e., I am OLD), I remember when it was considered bad manners for men to wear hats indoors. These days in Vegas, you see that etiquette rule disregarded right and left and it kind of makes me cringe.  So it was really nice to find a restaurant that values old-fashioned GOOD MANNERS such as this one.  Thank you, Lawry's for making an awesome first impression on this meat-lovin' momma!",

    "text": "Ok, it's important to realize, right up front, that I do not normally like prime rib. I do prime rib because it's my wife's favorite food. I, on the other hand, would rather have something with a much lower fat content.   So, that said, I'm annoyed that I can only give Lowry's five stars. I now *understand* the appeal of prime rib. And soaking up that amazing juice with the Yorkshire pudding, getting the gravy from the mashed potatoes all over it.... ungh. If I hadn't been there on a business dinner, I'd have rubbed one out while licking the plate; I seriously have never had meat taste that good in my entire life. My server, Miss Post, was a delight; she explained everything on the menu quite well, made some excellent suggestions (for example - TRY THE STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING - you will not regret it), and was fun and friendly as well.   Overall, the best dining experience I've had in a LONG, LONG, time.",

Not only was the food delicious but Ms. Taylor, our server, was the perfect mix of knowledge, professionalism and fun. The spinning salad was wonderful and the amount of dressing was perfect. The prime rib was out of this world as were the mushrooms and creamed spinach.  We will most definitely go back to Lawry's when we are home in Plano. I'm sure the experience will be just as fabulous.",

This is a classic and traditional steakhouse.  They are well known for their tableside service with the prime rib carts.  It may seem a little kitschy or gimmicky to the uninitiated bit it is not.  One in our group had the ribeye.  Wow.  If you are not a prime rib fan, don't be scared.  Lawry's did an exceptional job in the ribeye as well.  In fact, I think I'm going back for the ribeye!",

    "text": "I've been waiting a long time to try this restaurant. Just hearing about it from friends and reading reviews on Yelp made it that much more exciting. It's a very nice place, nice drive up entry and lobby, nice interior decor. It puts you in the mood for a nice relaxing dinner. Our server this night was Keith and he was very knowledgeable, prompt and patient. He explained everything from how the meal would be served, from the salad to the actual carving of the prime rib. You don't have to be concerned if you aren't sure what the various cuts of meat are. He said that when the chef comes table side he will show you the actual sizes.   Okay. First off, you get your drink orders filled, then you start off with your salad when you are ready. The salad is prepared table side on a cart with a large bowl in a bed of ice. The server proceeds to spin the bowl and tosses the dressing into it. They have a house seasoned pepper to put on your salad which is made by Lawry's. Very good and refreshing.  Next comes the main course... The prime rib! Yours truly opted for the Diamond Jim Brady cut, medium rare which has the bone in. It' s actually not that big of a serving when you consider that the bone is in. I think it was a 16oz cut. It was done perfect and I had it with the creamed spinach. Mashed potatoes come with it and the au jus is laddled onto your prime rib. Oh, and don't forget the Yorkshire pudding!  Also, my dining companion and I decided on a sizzling plate of mushrooms which were sauteed in butter and garlic.   As for dessert, well, that was far from my mind at the time! It was a very delicious and satisfying meal. If you decide on coming here for dinner, I suggest you have just a light lunch that day, I did and I'm glad I prepared myself for dinner! I really enjoyed my dining experience here and what made it even better was the excellent service provided by the employees here. From the front reception area to the servers, valet, they are very friendly and cordial. Give them a try when you're in Vegas.",

    "text": "I've been going to Lawry's to celebrate special occasions for a couple of decades now, at both this location and the Beverly Hills restaurant.  I hadn't been in a couple of years, so I was looking forward to our visit last weekend.  I have seen the quality of the decor deteriorate over the years, with people coming in with shorts and sneakers.  This is a nice restaurant and the dress code should really be enforced.  Aside from that, we were greeted with a friendly smile and brought to our table.  We brought our teenage kids this time to celebrate as a family.  I was struck by the addition of appetizers and the plethora of non-prime rib options rattled off by our server.  We came to Lawry's for the prime rib - there are plenty of places in Vegas for other items.  We all opted for the prime rib and enjoyed the experience of having the carving cart brought to the table and our orders sliced fresh on our plates.  Asparagus and potato strings were ordered additionally, however, it took quite a long time for these side items to arrive at our table (we were almost half way through our meal).  The waitress overheard our conversation about celebrating our anniversary and brought over a chocolate cake for dessert.  They used to have a delicious trifle for this purpose, but it is no longer on the menu.  That is a shame, because it was super tasty.  We ordered the cheesecake and a macadamia nut pie to share - all tasted good.  Overall, the service was good; however, the ambiance was a little disappointing (primarily from the other diners).  The food was good, but not as good as I remembered.  I was a bit disappointed in the overall experience as I was looking forward to this dinner.  Of course, the bill came and it was through the roof, which was expected, but I can't justify another trip to this place given the cost and the experience.  There are simply too many other nice restaurants in this city to experience given the price point.",

She kindly explained everything to us and helped us pick an epic meal.  We had the Calarmari to start with a bottle of Pinot noir and a glass of the local Vegas stout to start.  I don't know what was in that calamari dip but it's my new favorite calamari dip!  Also, since it was our first time here, we had the spinning salad and loved it!  Thousand island is my least favorite dressing..but somehow this was super tasty?! Dinner seriously only got better from here.  We had the Lawry cut and added the 9oz lobster, scalloped potatoes, and creamed spinach.  Oh my gosh, ORDER THE LOBSTER. Don't get the two little ones, go for the big fatty.  It was SO GOOD.  Trust me, it's worth it!   The chef comes by to slice your prime rib fresh from this prime rib station they bring around.  The chef was so sweet and was talking to my boyfriend about football.  This place really knows how to hire really cool people!  I definitely understand why everyone from Hawaii comes here.  Yeah it's a little cheesy, but they treat you like family and the food is fantastic.  I'm always making a stop here when I come to Vegas now, I'm just sad I didn't know about this place sooner",

Hubby and I were seated at a roomy booth and our drinks were never empty. A basket of warm bread with butter came out quick and tasted great. The price for the RW menu was $50.14 per person and I enjoyed the following for that price before tax:  The Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad - This is made right at your table. Our server, Ms. Huang had 2 metal bowls that spun as she added the dressing. The salad had lettuce, beets, hard boiled eggs, croutons and their signature vintage dressing. I haven't ever tasted a salad like this before. It was suggested that I add some of the Lawry's seasoning that was on the table, so I did. The salad tasted so fresh and delicious. Very good.  Mashed Potatoes - This was a nice addition to my plate. The mashed potatoes are whipped with butter and milk and tasted perfect. The brown gravy that came on it was good.   Buttered Peas - Yum! Being on the same plate, the peas ended up with brown gravy and au jus on them which I like. Plus, I just like peas!  Yorkshire Pudding - This comes in a skillet by itself. It tasted great and was perfect for soaking up the last bits of gravy on my plate. it was soft and really good.   Prime Rib - 8 ounces of pure heaven! A carver came to the table with a cart of prime rib and let me pick how I wanted it and then carved it right in front of me. I like mine a little more done and that's just what I got. The prime rib was so tender and literally fell apart. It had such great flavor. To say I didn't leave here stuffed would be absolutely wrong! Everything tasted good, but the prime rib was the True star.  Creme Brulee - This had fresh berries on top and It tasted so good, but I could only eat half because I was so full.   Coffee - Tasted great and was a perfect way to end the meal. At this point I just needed a pillow for a nap!  I can't say enough about our server. She was fantastic and took great care of us. The manager on duty, Wendy came over and chit chatted with us for maybe 10 minutes and she was warm and friendly. She let us know a little about the lunch menu which sounds like a winner. This was a great RW experience and I will be back!",

The bill with tip was $300 without any wine, cocktails, appetizers, or lobster.   I get that this place is vintage but it needs an update and flavor.  The salad, meat, and potatoes were very bland. The prime rib was very tender, but we had to cover it in extra seasoning, salt, horseradish, and juice to get any flavor.   Service was slow with the restaurant being less than half full. The salad and meat were prepared table side but you could tell they had done it a million times and put no effort into the experience, presentation, or plating.   For the price, I would have expected much more. This place isn't on the strip in a nice hotel but the prices didn't reflect that.",

And a couple of other minor details were lacking - but all in all - not bad at all.  You can tell there are a lot of regulars that repeat visits to the joint - the staff greeted them by name - nice touch!  There is a valet right at the door and he was on it with the car situation.

    "text": "The average of 4.5 stars for this Lawrys is a perfect example of why you have to be very careful with assuming stars mean \"good\".  I made a last minute decision to give this off strip steakhouse a try as I had already been to many of the better places on the strip (Stripsteak, Carnevino, Cut, Delmonicos, and others). I went thinking this must be great since it has 4.5 stars and Cut only has 4. I couldn't have been more wrong.   The decor is OK, if you like 20s Art Deco. The service is OK, if a little slow to start. Also, I found it very odd that they try to sell you a membership. I've never seen this in a \"nice\" restaurant.   They start you with the \"famous\" house salad. It's like something you'd get from Denny's. A simple mix that is supposed to be made better by being spun in a chilled bowl. It wasn't just boring, it also tasted like Thousand Island dressing.  My brother and I ordered the 12 oz Boneless Ribeyes. We also ordered a side of Asparagus and a baked potato. The steaks were requested medium rare but came out closer to medium. They weren't tender and were mostly tasteless. How do you mess up a ribeye?  The asparagus was 6 pieces and was over cooked. The backed potato was OK, but could have had a crunchy skin.  Lastly we gave them one more chance with dessert by ordering their Creme Brulee. It was boring and the caramelization was over done, so was bitter and rubbery.   Overall we paid about as much as if we had eaten at Stripsteak or Cut (both very good on the strip in casino steak restaurants), yet received a subpar dinner. I would not recommend anyone eat here unless it's at 50% of the price.",

You enter the restaurant and feel like you've been transported back in time 50 years and the smell and taste of the food matches that sensation. When they shouted my name to let me know my table was ready i should have known this was not going to be a great experience. The  prime rib is ok at best and the powdered mashed potatoes are bland. The wait staff was attentive but when Mr. Boyal (yes the waiter goes by Mr.) asked me if I wanted creamed spinach with my prime rib and mashed potatoes I did not think I would be charged extra but I was. Not a big deal but this sums up this place. Save the time and money and find your way to a top rated steakhouse.",

It was definitely a \"WOW\" factor not only for me but for 2 of my friends who were about to experience Lawry's for the first time. Then we are beyond surprised and excited to be entertained by amazing Christmas Carolers!! I had tears because Christmas time is very special to me aside from my birthday month - and because they saw how much we were enjoying them they came to our table and sang for us and chatted a bit and I couldn't have asked for anything more until our server presented himself in a beyond professional manner when trying to take care of us while another table next to us rudely called out to him when they wanted something. They kept calling him names like \"Harry Potter\" and even when we were singing along with the carolers the younger girl at that table kept telling my boyfriend to shut up and \"shhh\" not because she wanted to hear but because she just wanted to be rude since she was on her tablet anyway. My best friend and I were so impressed with our server and how he handled it all we had to rave to him to the manager on duty who we've learned has been with the company for almost 30 years! For our experience with our neighboring table he offered to buy us drinks so we had to leave but it was still a sweet gesture that I won't forget! The food, the service, the ambiance... it never disappoints in general but this place at Christmas time is magical. I want to say our servers name was Matteos but I'm probably way off - he was a super sweet Greek guy that wears glasses. So between him and the manager on duty (5pm was our reservation time) we cannot thank you enough. Lawry's is a must anytime we go to Vegas (even my bestie is stating this now after 1 visit) and cannot wait to be back again!",

Sinatra tunes provided the soundtrack to our meal. Notably entertaining moments include the spinning salad bowl prep & the prime rib being carved tableside from an impressive rolling cart.   I ordered beef ribs mostly because I don't eat prime rib. I appreciate that our waitress set a steak knife down for me...there's just no way to look gracious & ladylike while gnawing on a giant rib. Relished the condiments that came on the side (no pun intended) -- mango BBQ sauce & chipotle ketchup were both good to dip fries into. An okay meal in a dining room with cozy booths & an interesting ceiling.",

We both got the lawry cut and were stuffed by the end of it.  I think it was about $47 (expensive but at least it's very quality food) and it came with a salad, which I was super into.  I didn't even know I liked beets before I had them in my salad and now we are like BFF.   Actually, meat will always be my food BBF, but beets and I are cool now.     The meal also came with mashed potatoes, which you usually have to order separately when you go to a steakhouse.   Definitely a bonus that it was included.  I asked if they had some sort of magic wand to turn my mashed potatoes into garlic mashed potatoes.  Needless to say they did, and I feel like it was a mega upgrade.    Also shared a creamed corn with the wife.  Who knew corn could be so satisfying.  They took good care of us and we felt very welcomed and cared for.   Lawrys is gonna be a my go to for a fancy meal that I won't have to take out a second mortgage to go to.   You know how steakhouses be sometimes.",

We've never had a bad experience here.    We started out with Lawry's famous spinning bowl salad (I like the house vinaigrette while my wife likes the homemade ranch dressing) and sourdough bread.  My wife doesn't care for Prime Rib so she gets the lobster tail dinner.  I, on the other hand, had a meeting with the \"Diamond Jim\" cut of beef.  Mr. Wong, the master carver, sliced off an awesome piece of fork-tender prime rib and matched that with their classic mashed potatoes and the to-die-for cream corn.  Lawry's has completely ruined prime rib for me.  And I could only aspire to make my cream corn as good as theirs.  The wife's lobster tails (there are 3 of them) were incredibly sweet and perfectly prepared.  Also need to add that the Yorkshire Pudding is something you can't miss.  Our server, Mr. Boyle (Vic) was incredible.  He was very attentive and provided great humor and conversation.    As we were celebrating our birthday's, we were treated to warmed pound cake for dessert.  It's not a cheap night out.  But if you want to splurge and celebrate something special, this is the place to go.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "From the spinning salad to the bread pudding, you can't go wrong with everything that comes in between. I have been visiting Lawry's Prime Rib for years now and this is by far, my favorite place to get the prime rib. The Beverly Hills location will always be considered home for me, but it was nice to eat here at the Vegas location while visiting for EDC.   Taylor was my server and she was really sweet. She made many great suggestions, but I know that the prime rib will always win my heart.   I love the chilled spinning salad because it's cold and different. The salad is in a metal bowl sitting in a bath of ice. Taylor gives it a big spin and while its spinning, she pours in the dressing.   As for the prime rib, it's really amazing to see the chef come by in his gigantic oven-like cooker! You just tell him exactly what cut you want, how much you like it cooked, and if you want any sides. I always get the California cut, cooked close to medium rare, along with a side of mash potatoes and creamed corn. To top that off, you also get the amazing bread pudding and horse radish to eat your prime rib with.  My boyfriend ordered the lobster tail with the filet mignon steak and was a bit disappointed. Not because it didn't taste good, but because the prime rib tasted better.  I used my Amex card to pay for dinner and was able to get back $25! I'd say this dinner was a win win situation!",

So when I had some VIPs in town this is where we chose to have a business lunch at.   The ambiance of the restaurant was exactly what you'd expect... a timeless classic! On top of it the gentleman acting as maitre de was even more classy in greeting us/helping us get seated. I only wish he was serving us :(  After being seated, it took us about five minutes for someone to acknowledge us and bring over some water/take drink orders. It then took our waitress another 10 minutes to come over and take our orders... We had business to discuss, but 15 minutes to be tended to after arriving could/would be bested by Chili's (and they're not charging Chili-prices at Lawry's!) All this while there were only 4 other tables in the entire restaurant makes it inexcusable.  Love the big sterling silver-like grill wheeled over to carve prime rib right in front of us, but the cuts appeared thinner than ordered and duo carving (yes, 2-guys carving?!?) was, well, not exactly the friendliest? It's not that they said anything inappropriate, but gave off some serious negativity. I'm pretty certain they would have been more comfortable back in the kitchen behind the wall.  The prime rib (even though it was thinner than ordered) was still great (4-stars) but here again our server couldn't be found to provide some horseradish (She was a little busy tending to one of the other 4 tables with a little small talk!?!)   Long story short, and I hate writing poor reviews, but I rely on Yelp to provide me with reviews when traveling. With that in mind, there are a ton of awesome restaurants in Las Vegas you can conduct a business lunch... I really wanted Lawry's to be one of them. Looks like I'll have to settle for the seasoning salt somewhere else...  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? No Return? No Advocate? No",

But it honestly seemed like a knock off House of Prime Rib.  The prime rib doesn't come with creamed spinach/corn so we ordered it on the side just to give it a try and compare it to HOPR. It was just alright so I wouldn't order it again. Mashed potatoes came with the prime rib and it was good. I asked for extra gravy and it was a good idea because the mashed potatoes needed it. The bread was good and their salad was mediocre. The prime rib was tasty and I loved their spicy horse radish to go with it.  Overall, if I had to choose, I'd definitely go to HOPR because not only does it taste better, the price is also a better deal.",

Year after year the location has gotten consistently worse.  This year was an all time low. From mandatory valet being a joke to the food being cold and late. My children received their food 30 minutes after the adults. Additionally the Prime Rib was cold. So cold that the fat layer was solid like Crisco. After a couple hours of frustration, we were happy to leave. Super disappointed and unfulfilled.  Would not recommend.",

    "text": "We were celebrating a special occasion at Lawry's in Las Vegas on our annual trip to the city.  While dining, we were subjected to racial insults and degrading comments from a nearby table.  This table, with approx. 6 adults, loudly called other patrons in the restaurants names, racial slurs, etc.  Continuing their rudeness and inappropriate behavior, they also loudly berated a group of LGBT diners, calling them \"f@ggoty men\".  They were calling people of color \"J@ps\", \"N...\" and \"Ch!nks\".  As they continued to be over-served bottles of wine, the insults became louder and louder.  Finally, someone from our group went to speak with them to keep their voices down because we were having a family dinner and it was inappropriate, not only for us but for everyone else in the restaurant.  It was disappointing and sad that no staff member jumped in and said anything.  They kept serving the wine but did nothing about the bad behavior.  As we were leaving, one member of the group chased us into the lobby yelling.  Again, nothing from the staff to defuse the situation.  This quickly escalated into a situation where someone could have gotten hurt.  It's difficult to put into words how horrible the experience was.  Sadly, the staff were completely oblivious and did nothing to help.  For amount of money we paid (we were a party of 13), it added insult to injury and our special meal should have been at a restaurant where were were not subjected to racial slurs and insults during our meal.",

We were served by Ms. Guevara and she was nothing but charismatic and nice to us throughout the whole dinner service.   I ordered the California cut of the prime rib with creamed spinach and creamed corn.  Next time, I'll just stick with the spinach but at least I tried both since it was my first time there.  The prime rib was the perfect blend of tenderness and taste. I also tried their mild horseradish and it was good!  (I usually hate that stuff).   My husband ordered the bone-in rib eye medium-rare and it came out medium-well.  We told our waitress and they made a new one but when the new one came out, it was SUPER cold on the inside. Being afraid of dealing with the kitchen staff, we didn't say anything. Our waitress was apologetic the first time and we know it wasn't her fault as she did write down the correct temperature my husband wanted his meat.   We had the chocolate cake and it was very rich!  Overall, they're known for their prime rib so just order that. Don't order any other meat.",

    "text": "A Beverly Hills classic is also a Las Vegas classic.    We were early for our reservation, unfortunately they were delayed and behind on the night.  It didn't look overly busy, so maybe they were done a server or two.  They quoted a 15 minute delay.  They welcomed us to the bar where the bartender was super friendly, casual, and gave us a bunch of complimentary house made chips.  The chips were good, light, cripsy, slighly oily, just the way I like um.  He asked to be a part of the picture while I was about to snap it and I obliged.  The 15 minute delay turned out to only be 10 minutes.  Once you enter, its as you expect of an old fashioned american steakhouse.  Slightly dim lights, staff welcoming, and stomach anticipation growling for the soon to be consumation of fine prime rib.  The waitresses are all dressed in old fashioned attire, keeping with the original tradition.  Our server Mrs. Amir was very knowledgeable, professional, and always asking if we were doing ok.  She asked if anyone was ordering anything other then Prime Rib and none of us raised our hands.  This mean she only needed to take drink/appetizer orders as the carving cart will come around with a live cow (ok maybe not live, but close to it) along with choice of sides when we were ready for our main entree.    Prime Rib:  Diamond Jim Brady Cut was huge.  This was the bone in choice and I never had Bone-In Prime Rib before.  It was the \"Best I Ever Had,\" like Drake says.  Too big though for even a caveman like me.  If you want the bone in, you will have to order this cut.  I recommend NOT eating anything for 5 days prior.    Fried Artichoke:  Delicious.  Plump, thinly fried, and plentiful.  This was not on the normal menu and was a special.   Spinning Salad:  Included.  The lettuce is meh, the quality does not match what I expect from this establishment, but all the goodies inside it including \"Vintage\" dressing made it good.  Creamed Spinach:  Another \"Best I Ever Had\" moment.  Not too creamy or pasty, nor too thick or dry.  Just a perfect consistency and a great surprise to the meal.  Sizzling Skillet of Mushrooms:  I think we got a lesser end on this one.  It did not come out sizzling as I swear I saw it come sizzling to another table.  It was still good, maybe a big gamey the more you ate it.  I wonder if it really is supposed to come out sizzling?  In summary, the whole package delivers as 4 Stars.  The price to value ratio is excellent.  Service, Quality of food, Atmosphere well done.",

    "text": "First time here with our local friends who were virgins as well.  We had reservations for 5 at 7 on a Tuesday night.  We got Drew Caseri for a waiter who we found out at the end of the meal had only been on staff for a week...NEVER would have guessed it!  He was great. Everyone got the prime rib except me...for the first time probably ever, I was just not that hungry.  So, my hubby and female friend got the Cowboy cut, the small one, which is only about 6 ounces (we had to ask because the cuts do not list actual ounces).  Another table mate got the medium Lawry's cut (approx 10 oz) and the other got the Diamond Jim Brady cut (didn't tell us ounces for this).  I would say if you order prime rib at another restaurant, you would get about 10-12 oz for the smallest dinner cut.  So, for the prices, I thought they were small.  I piggy backed off my hubby's meal and got the lobster tail add-on for $15.  It was good, but slightly overcooked and small.  I also got a side of the creamed corn which was the bomb!  I tried my hubby's prime rib and it was really good as well as the potatoes and gravy.  Now, comes the best part.  Since I ate light, I splurged for the mango mojito which was great and then the sticky toffee pudding with whipped cream & ice cream.  Hubby got the chocolate cake.  Wouldn't order the cake again...the frosting between layers and on top was hard like a candy bar...no creamy frosting on this anywhere.  But my pudding...holy freakin cow!  It tastes exactly like a dessert my mother used to make that my hubby and I love.  This was just as good and we moaned through every bite!  All in all, we would go back sometime.  Not cheap, but great food.  The service was really great all evening.",

I never had salad that was spun in a bowl before but apparently they are known for it here. I don't usually like salad but I did eat this one and liked it. The prime rib was juicy and tender. A guy came to the table and carved the prime rib in front of us. The prime rib here is definitely worth coming here for. I really liked the yorkshire pudding and other sides. It was all very good and filling. For dessert I had chocolate lava cake. It was warm, soft, and the chocolate in the middle oozed out and tasted great.

    "text": "Let me start out saying that I heart House of Prime Rib in San Francisco. I think that is the best prime rib I have ever eaten...  My buddy and I arrive at 9 pm and get seated in the \"casual business\" room. Yes... Its the room to the far right of the main dining room. We both were sporting dark jeans and a nice button up shirt, but he was wearing tennis shoes since we came straight from picking him up at the airport. Either way, casual dressed room is fine with me... =)  The overly pleasing waiter hands us our menu and retreats to grab some bread. We give the menu a once over and decide on the biggest cut... The Beef Bowl Cut. Advertised as \"A double sized cut with the rib bone, as served to the Rose Bowl and Cotton Bowl teams\"... How can we go wrong?  The waiter comes back and takes our drink orders. We tell him that we are ready to order and he tells us to wait. What? Wait?! He proceeds to tell us that the cut and sides order is taken after the appetizers and salad when the cool Hindenburg looking cart magically appears.  He returns and brings the salad. They spin and toss it the same way HOPR does it in San Francisco, but we didn't want to ruin his show so we played along... Ooooo.... ahhhh.... Fancy! The salad is refreshing and a must to stay regular in the morning after so much meat! Haha.  We make haste on the salad with the main course on our minds. Finally... The moment we've all been waiting for... The silver blimp mobile cart! The waiter introduces the master carver, Insert Name Here (really, because his name isnt that important and he isnt going to slice you a bigger piece no matter what clever witty line you throw at him), and proceeds to ask us what cut we would like. \"Beef Bowl Cut. medium rare please\", and yes we say please because we are polite! Haha.  Some differences... HOPR comes with a choice of mashed or baked potato with the works. Lawry's only comes with mashed.  HOPR comes with a choice of creamed corned or creamed spinach. Lawry's has those too.... But for a price. I think it was like $6 or something for a scoop of the creamy spinach. Either way, I had to get it just to taste comparison...  The 25oz bone in medium rare prime rib was humongous. Was I going to eat the whole thing? You better believe it! Or die trying...! We dig in. The meat was tender and flavorful. The au jus sauce was a wonderful supporting character to the show. The raw horseradish was the perfect \"you complete me\" condiment and boy did it ever...!  Needless to say, we both made it pretty damn close to finishing it. All that was left was the meat near the bone, which I took home with my unfinished mashed potato and creamed spinach. Yes, it was still pretty good the next morning too!  And after every show there is the..... encore! Yes! HOPR always offers you a complimentary second slice, which is a thin cut, but a nice touch... Lawry's? Nope... Would I have eaten it if they offered it? Probably not... But its the thought that counts!  All in all I would like to say that HOPR still reins supreme in my heart but Lawry's does make a suitable substitute in Las Vegas... Well that is until I try another prime rib joint... And no... The prime ribs they serve in the buffets are nowhere close to the real deal.  As always... Check out the picture!",

The atmosphere is wonderful, upscale but not stuffy.  Our waiter Mr Jones was fantastic.  The prime rib is probably the best that we have ever had, the salad is to die for.  We didn't add any additional sides but the cream corn, mashed potatoes, gravy and Yorkshire pudding were more than enough for us.  Unfortunately we were too full to try any of the deserts, but will definitely go back and save some room to try desert.",

Now, when I come to Vegas, I expect to pay a little and eat helluva a lot (like, just about 'til I'm ready to throw up).  I'm a buffet kinda gal, what can I say?   BUT, I make the exception for Lawry's.  I freakin' love this place.  Every birthday and anniversary celebration that I'm in Vegas for, I head to Lawry's (and they've generously given us a free slice of cake if we're celebrating something).   The price for a dinner is very reasonable, the food always exceeds my expectations and the service is consistently excellent as well.  It doesn't matter how many buffets they offer in Vegas - I will always come back to Lawry's for their mouth-watering deliciousness.  TIP: I've always made a reservation and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table.",

IF you even have room for the salad bar you are a champion.  I think the meal is like $25 and it's super quick b/c everything is already made. You can be in and out of here in like 40 mins flat.

We arrived on-time for our reservation, and were apologetically told that they were running 10 minutes late.  No problem with us.    However after 25 minutes, we checked back and were immediately seated. And there we sat at our table, another 25 minutes, until a manager walked by and inquired as to why we were not eating our warm sourdough bread.  We explained, no waitress, no food, no nothing.  The manager kindly found us bread, opened our bottle of wine, and probably goosed our waitress to get in action.  Once we had the attention of the waitress, she was pleasant and helpful.  Let's talk about the food.  Prime rib, not great, we've had way better.  The au jus tasted like it was made from a dried powder mix.  In general, everything we ate tasted like it was made from low quality ingredients.  We won't be going back.  Diners, beware!!",

We had Ms. O'Reilly for a waitress and she was as professional and knowledgeable as she was beautiful and charming.  We all agreed, especially me, if we returned we would want her as our server again. The lack of stars comes from a pet peeve of mine.  It is the lack of enforcement of any sort of dress codes in Vegas fine dining establishments.  Lawry's puts great emphasis that hats are not allowed in the dining room, but yet people are dressed in jeans and t-shirts.  Maybe I am a little old school, but I believe that there is a certain level dress that should be expected and enforced at some establishments.",

    "text": "SOOOOOOOOO  consistently great!  From super courteous, friendly, timely service to the hot fresh sourdough bread.... Spinning salad is always very good, although probably could go a touch lighter on the dressing.   Cutting to the chase... the mashed potatoes that come standard are excellent... fresh/smooth/tasty beef gravy.  But really, u GOTTA get the creamed corn.  Would recommend ordering that in a side dish as it's a larger portion which also makes it easier to share with one other.  Plus, the au jus won't run into it so much as it does on the plate.  We also shared a baked potato as it was excellent.    But what good is anything if the prime rib isn't 5 star.  Have prime rib everywhere, including the HOP'er (House of Prime Rib in SF), and you just can ever go wrong here.  So consistently flavorful and tender from the outside of the roast on in.  I hate it when the only flavor is on the outer crust and the inside is just so bland.  Also, very helpful that the au jus is so flavorful as well but really, the beef is where it should be.  The Lawry's cut is seemingly plenty even for a big eater, but if you are super hungry, then go for the biggest cut.  For ladies, the California cut is also a very satisfying amount, especially with the appropriate sides.    Didn't have time for dessert, but i tell you what... Consistently awesome.  We were in/out in 60 minutes, which isn't for every occasion.  But if running off to a show/quick date night with sitter at home, it's great.  So, it's not exactly a slooooooow, course out and take 2 hours super special event meal.    Always a win!  How awesome is that in Vegas right?",

There wasn't nothing special at all. The price was too expensive and Truthfully I didn't even want to finish my meal. My fiance got the lobster tail and the filet, and that was the most dry filet we ever had. Was surely not worth $70 for that plate. The ambiance was not worth the price either. The waitresses were dressed in old school outdated weirdo outfits  and you could just tell they didn't want to wait there.    We were offered a free desert but it was called lemon butt cake, (what an awful name) . The best part of the experience was taking the leftovers we had and giving it to a homeless man, seeing his smile was priceless, so I guess the $178 dollars I spent for my girl and i was worth it.",

BUT this slice was huge! perfect to share with two other people. or just the right size for you when you need some sweets  pros: - service: perfection, as always - food was awesome! everyone loves it when the cart comes around, cause it's eatin time! - able to make a rez right before we walked in - didn't rush us. we had a very late dinner, and were probably the last patrons there, but no one rushed our meal and let use enjoy every bite - huge dining room! plenty of seats for small or large parties  cons: - it's a bit stuffy. when i go to the beverly hills location, it's the type of place older rich people go. but, regardless, it's nice to treat yourself, especially after winning some money at the roulette table! - no meatballs! maybe we came too late, maybe they don't do it at this location, but i really missed the mini meatballs the beverly hills location usually has in their bar as an appetizer for people who are waiting. oh well  would i come again? um... i duno, maybe if i were in town and in the mood for prime rib, minus the buffet.   corkage fee was $25 (i think???)",

In fact, I selected it for my wife's 60th birthday dinner. While the food was great everything else was just okay, which was disappointing on such a special occasion.   We started by waiting for a table when the restaurant was clearly not full. Then we were put in the back room at an awkwardly placed table and when we asked for a booth in the main dining room we were given an attitude and waited again. Certainly not the five star service of Beverly Hills. The waiter was also not what you would expect in this caliber restaurant.   Overall, given the other many amazing restaurants in Vegas, I would look elsewhere and probably not return to this one.",

Since they cut it right in front of you, you'll probably be getting varying degrees of \"well-done\"-ness. My medium rare was closer to the rarer side, and my dad's was closer to the medium side. Lovely juicy and tender portion of prime rib, gently seasoned but marvelously welcoming of any added flavoring if you so wish. The meat sauce that is gently splashed on the side is a welcomed hint of flavor that complements the prime rib without taking the spotlight away from it. Adding some horseradish gives it a slight heat that still highlights the rib; I personally mixed the mild and strong one to get both worlds without overwhelming the palette--just a hint!. As expected, the meat closer to the bone was juicier and had more flavor, but my whole portion was beautiful and very satisfying. Lawry's prime rib really seals in their flavors!  - Spinning Bowl Salad: It's no mistake that you're going to get a classic garden salad, their special dressing that tastes too close to Thousand Island, and some croutons. Spin that around and apparently the salad is supposed to seem a little more gourmet? Sorry, it really wasn't special no matter how many times you spin it. I expected a lot more from a salad--how about a lot more baby greens and maybe less iceberg? The cold plate the salad rested on was a nice touch though, nevertheless.  Pros:  - Excellent flavors and commendable menu options.  - Prime Rib options are worth looking into.  - Luxury night of fancy food? Yes, this is where you wear your suit and tie and dress if you so wish!  - Helpful and attentive wait staff. We were asked about our food by like 5 different employees.  - Complimentary valet parking. Yes!  Cons:  - That spinning salad just didnt cut it--it felt so underwhelming compared to the other food items! The \"cheap\"-ness stood out more than anything else.  - Maybe it was just our table but it was kind of foamy/spongey under the table cloth. This thus made it hard to aerate my wine. Also seemed kind of cheap since normal tables never have this odd layer?  - I tried some of my father's \"medium-rare\" steak and it really had a large portion of medium-well pieces. Meanwhile, mine was more rarer than medium-rare. I understand why it's difficult to get perfect searing and cook levels when you're carving it from a station--but I would have been a bit angrier if I was paying for a medium-rare and got something less than stellar!   Horseradish hints:  - They come in creamed (mild) and grated (much stronger) horseradish options. I ventured off and mixed both of them so I can get an in-between option since both were too polarized. It turned out perfect, just like I wanted it with just enough heat and mildness! Try it yourself on a separate plate and lather away!  In the end I have a hard time reconciling great flavors and options with the price paid. There is no doubt that Lawry's has quality and note-worthy prime rib options, so take no fear that those who love this cut of meat...will be granted satisfaction to their heart's desire. Cheers!",

    "text": "My first time at a Lawry's. FYI Prime Rib is about your only option here. The menu was more story then actually food choices.   Guess what our group ordered?  If you guessed Prime Rib, then you win!  The waitresses wear outfits from the 1950's which is a little weird.  We need to call a reality show to do an extreme makeover here. There hats look like nurses hats from WW II.   Our waitress, Mrs. Huong was very nice.  She was also very tolerant because we were joking and laughing all night. She even got in on some of the fun.   The next part was a suprise for me. The chef wheeled out a silver buffet and opened it in front of us. It was loaded with meat.  I asked for medium rare and he cut it in front of me. He also threw my sides on the plate.  I am not sure I entirely liked the process.  It was like Fago de Chao met a single serve buffet in Vegas!!!  The Prime Rib was amazing...so were the mashed potatos. I highly recommend the Key Lime pie but suggest you share it with someone because it is so rich.",

My salad did not seem as fresh as it should have been. I can't be certain but it looked like older lettuce. Now the meat. Very impressed that they cut the meat right in front of you. You tell them what cut and how you like it cooked very nice. The prime rib was excellent. Service was very good. Frequent refills on water - I never had an empty glass where I had to find someone to fill. Also the booth was very nice. It was semi circular comfortable booth with lots of space for four. The hostess pulled the table out to make getting in easier. Overall a very nice place. But I think this was a little pricey.",

Quite possibly the best prime rib (but still not the best steak) I've ever had.  The sides were meh, which almost made me downgrade the rating to 4 stars, but the ambience and good service were enough to offset this.    Interestingly, the rib itself comes around in a cart and they shave it off for you right in front of you.  As well, growing up my household always had a bottle of seasoned salt which we put on pretty much everything - turns out it was Lawry's Seasoned Salt (I didn't connect the dots until I tasted some & memories started flooding back).",

I am glad they didn't jack up prices for special turkey dinner like some places that charged north of $50 for turkey plates.

I probably could have gotten the rib eye or prime rib somewhere else and close my eyes and  I couldn't tell the difference.  It is delicious but I think it can taste just as good anywhere else.  The prime rib and service is 5 star but I down graded the stars because of the pricing for what you get I know going here from the start it is expensive but sitting there and seeing the food infront of me just made me realized that this is a special occasion place.  The table service is nice but I don't need it.   Our friends come here every time they come up to lv we only joined them a couple of times out of their 100 times. She has a Lawry gold card, can you imagine that?   I enjoyed the atmosphere and food but it is just kind of on the high side.  Like Ruth Chris or Morton steakhouse.  It is nice to go for a special occasion.   But not just to have dinner, After all we are in Las Vegas, there are TOO many other places we can go for a good dinner. The service is good, the mash potatoes were kind if bland and not very potatoe tasting.  It taste like a bad box mash potatoes.  i don't mean to be exactly that mean but for a place like that (expensive) you would think that the potatoes would be more creamy, potato and buttery taste.  The bread was warm and delicious.   The lobster came right off the shell without a struggle. The meal is basic but yummy for sure.  I was full after four slices of bread.  The bread was wonderful!  Just an expensive place.  But it is like a Lancome lipstick price when you can buy Avon who Lancome makes their make up for Avon so it is the same product just less.   Or Kirkland brand is really made by a brand name.  Lawrys is lawry you will never be disappointed just expect to pay.",

As good as Lawry's is, it is a DISTANT second choice... but.. they are in business ... so it is an easy choice.  I was lucky enough to try the Lawry's in Singapore once a few years ago and I remember it was decent.... This didn't disappoint.  On par with the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco, they offered all the same menu items and side dishes.  I did find their cuts to be a bit inconsistent... Two in our group ordered the \"Lawry's cut\" and I ordered the \"Jim Brady\" cut  (one size larger)... and It didn't look all that different than the Lawry's cut.... So less one star!  Service was great... what you would expect from a high end prime rib house.",

Old school restaurant feel and seating is a little strange, but I guess it works....they pull out the tables and you sit next to each in a booth at least if there's a small party.  The service is attentive and the waitress was extremely friendly.  The ambiance is nice, but has the typical Vegas feel when it comes to how dressy you need to be...some people were definitely dressed well, while others were in jeans and tank tops...  The meal starts with the signature spinning salad...given the fact I abhor salads...this one was actually pretty tasty! Next the prime rib cart with the sides comes over and you can select how you prefer your cut of prime rib and the sides offered are fatty heaven as well.  We selected the creamed corn and creamed spinach.  The creamed corn was a little too sweet for my liking, but the creamed spinach was delicious with little pieces of bacon mixed in.  The meal also comes with mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding (an eggy/bread mixture).  Portions are more than generous and you leave anticipating the food coma to hit!  Although I paid the pre-fixed price, perusing the menu....the prices on the normal menu seemed quite reasonable considering their large portion sizes!  Will definitely recommend this place to any friends looking for some good prime rib!",

    "text": "I hope management reads this... and our rating of the service is NOT about our waitress, Ms C - she was AWESOME!!! our complaint and it just set the tone - a bad vibe for sure was arriving 7:20 for 7:30 reservations... Very very long line at front check in, but hey it was a Saturday night... we get to the hostess stand and are told that they do not have a reservation for us and that it will be an hour wait... I told \"Biotch #1\" that I had a confirmation and she said that there was no reservation... then she said oh, our reservation is for 9:30 and that it would be an hour... I showed her the confirmation on my iphone... no matter, what was in the computer was what it was... I was furious!  \"Biotch #2\" before she became a biotch 2 tells  biotch #1 to just change the reservation in the computer... wow problem solved yes - uh er no... in the meantime we see and hear other guests coming in with 7:45 reservations who get seated before us... WTF... really? I'm going postal now... Biotch #2 (who is now truly a biotch) says, they had earlier resi's than us... uh uh... I was standing right next to them and heard them check in... I would like to speak with the manager who I plead my case to, only to hear biotch #2 tell him that they have been trying to seat us and calling us but we didn't answer... FML really??? UGH set the night off to crappollazville...  We get seated next and go to the back of the restaurant only to see 3 empty tables for two... that 2 of the 3 sat empty the rest of the night... OMG hello Management are you there??? What was the issue people?  Ok, enough with the ranting... our server, Ms C was awesome... smart, funny, whitty... Food was perfect! We finally settled in and put the horrendous hostess f;up behind us and enjoyed a great meal... Notice we're not spending a lot of time talking about the food... Why, cuz it was Lawry's perfect! Somebody should have seen me eating off the bone, cuz it was not very gentlemanly... it was carnivorous.. Very reasonable prices when as it is off strip... Reasonable compared to hotel prices btw...  Note to Management... training 101... \"Oh, we're terribly sorry for the simple mistake Mr. F... here, we will have a table in just a few moments... thank you so much for your patience... \"  Note to Upper Management... fire lower management and the hostesses...",

    "text": "Joined my mom on a trip out to Las Vegas and Lawry's was top on our list of restaurants to try.  We arrived a little early on a Tuesday evening and were met by the very pleasant staff, welcomed warmly, and seated promptly.  The restaurant was very quiet, serene, and immaculate, with several tables still open (not a surprise since it was fairly early for dinner).  My mom ordered a sangria to start off with, which she loved, while I ordered a non-alcoholic strawberry daiquiri (designated driver you know).  Skipping appetizers, we decided to order our dinner entrees, both the prime rib, which included mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, and their famous spinning house salad!  We also chose to add a shared side of cream corn.  The waitress brought out the salad service first and mixed it for us tableside.  The presentation was fun, but the salad was AMAZING!  When it was time for our entrees, our waitress signaled to another server, who wheeled over a large silver cart.  He stopped, opened it and revealed all of the meaty glory that lay within!  Our waitress then informed the server of our requested cut and temperature and he sliced the prime ribs right there, dishing out the mashed potatoes and gravy and then adding the pudding.  Our plates were perfection!  Almost immediately, the creamed corn arrived and we began!  EVERYTHING...and I mean EVERYTHING...was PERFECT!!!  The prime rib was so tender and flavorful, the mashed potatoes were fresh and creamy and the accompanying gravy was salty and delicious, and the Yorkshire pudding was perfect for soaking up excess gravy and jus!  The creamed corn was jaw dropping!  I have never had such amazing creamed corn in my life!  I mentioned this to the waitress, who informed me that the recipe was available on their website and super simple to make!  Overall, this was a perfect meal and one that I will look back on fondly for a very long time.  I cannot wait to return!",

The potato salad and fresh salads on the bar (complimentary with your sandwich) are very good, fresh and worthy of a second trip for more.  The service at Lawry's is unmatched which is saying a lot in the hospitality that Vegas offers. The dinner experience is always a must especially if you order the prime rib - be ready for a show :)",

    "text": "First thing I want to say about this fine establishment is that the service is top-notch. You generally expect exceptional service at a classy establishment, and Lawry's definitely delivers from the moment you enter to the moment you leave.  The two of us came here on a Friday night around 7pm and were seated immediately. The restaurant lot is very large; there is ample self-parking as well as valet parking (both options are complimentary). The restaurant itself has a beautiful and elegant red-themed decor inside.  We were given complimentary bread and butter (quite good!) and then ordered the $48 Lawry Cut of Prime Rib (10 oz. of their traditional and most popular cut), which came with their famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad (unique and fun presentation!), mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, and whipped cream horseradish, as well as the $52 Lawry's Ribeye Steak (14 oz. option). which came with the Original Spinning Bowl Salad, scalloped potatoes, and crispy fried onions. We also had the $11 Sizzling Skillet of Mushrooms (smells amazing and good for sharing between 3-4 people), and a $7 half-Creamed Spinach, half-Creamed Corn order (tasty ways to eat spinach and corn and good for 1-2 people).  The salad came first and tasted great. The meat entrees took close to 25 minutes to come, but it was well worth the wait. Both cuts of meat were served from a portable roasting tray on wheels and were amazing, flavorful, and cooked perfectly (we ordered medium-well and medium respectively), and adding some of their house-made salt and pepper made the meat even more delicious.  There are a lot of fancy restaurants you can go to while in Vegas. However, if you're looking to splurge on a fancy dinner that isn't just about the classy ambiance and priciness, but is also about delicious food, generous well-worth-it portions, and great service, then I highly recommend you try Lawry's!",

    "text": "My first time coming here during a girls trip to Vegas. My parents have been once before and loved it! So of course coming back with my mom we made this our fancy dinner spot. I love prime rib!! So I was excited for this. They did. Or disappoint at all with the prime rib!! I got the Lawry's cut, and was Lucky to get it with a bone. I was so excited for the sides, but was very disappointed in the mashed potatoes. They were extremely runny and the flavor was dull. I expected so much more for it being such a well known place. I know the main focus is the meats, but sides are important too. The creamed corn was very good and the spinach was tasty. The prime rib literally melts in your mouth. The best I have ever had!!!! My mom ordered the lobster tail trio, as she did the first time she went, loved her lobster but was disappointed this time with her sides as well. Her veggies and rice pilaf had no flavor at all. Just very bland and tasteless and a littler over boiled making it a little mushy. Over all I would definitely come back for the prime Rib! No doubt about it, just wish their sides lived up to their standard of meat as well.  Oh yea!!! When I asked them to box my left over prime rib I asked them to please also box the bone(a lot of meat left on it), unfortunately i was walking to the bathroom as i asked quickly and my bone wasn't boxed.",

    "text": "Lawry's Fact:  They serve 750,000 lbs. of meat at the Lawry's Restaurants each year!  With only four locations in the U.S., it took a while before I got a chance to pop into a Lawry's but I'm glad I finally did!  We started with a Lychee Martini, a glass of Malbec, and half a dozen oysters. Three were salt water oysters from the Atlantic and the other three were freshwater oysters. They were both fabulous. After the oysters came their \"Signature Spinning Salad.\" Did you know that Lawry's was one of the first restaurants to feature a green salad as an integral part of every meal? It was a delicious salad with a sherry wine dressing. Our waiter told us we should try it with their seasoned pepper. It was good! By the time I got to the prime rib, because you can't go to Lawry's without getting prime rib, I was full. I still enjoyed watching my meat get carved table-side in the big metal cart. I got the smaller California Cut, medium rare, with the side of mashed potatoes and their Yorkshire pudding. With Lawry's being known for their seasoned salt, having been created just for their prime rib, it was indeed a delicious bite with the salt. The prime rib, drench in au jus, was so melt-in-your-mouth perfect and was so tender. Add a little whipped cream horseradish and wow!  Our waiter, Mike, was extraordinary. He knew it was our first time in so he made sure to fill us in with all sorts of fun facts and information! He even gave us a complimentary dessert that screams fall. Cranberries and cinnamon? Yes please! I would definitely stop by again!",

During our visit, they were running a special for $69/person you got a choice of one of three wines, their house salad (Made Tableside), an entree (Choice between Lawry's Cut Prime Rib, Filet Mignon for a $6 upgrade charge, or Salmon), Yorkshire Pudding, Choice of Creamed Corn, Creamed Spinach or 1/2 order of both, and a Choice of Dessert (Hot Fudge Sundae or Creme Brulee). Service was very fast and organized! Our drinks, appetizer, and food orders were taken shortly after being seated. Our waters were always topped off without being told and our waiter made sure to check on us throughout the entire meal! My wife and I both went with the Special. Wife ordered the Filet Mignon served with Scalloped Potatoes and fried onion.I went with the Lawry's Cut Prime Rib served with mashed potatoes, gravy, au jus, and 1/2 order of both the creamed corn and creamed spinach. Food was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Because we were celebrating our Anniversary, they even gave us a free dessert which our waiter allowed us to take home because we already had desserts as part of our meal. We'll definitely be back again. Thank you for making our first visit an awesome one!",

My hubby and i decided to share the Lawry's cut  with one lobster each. The serving was generous and we can barely finish our steak. The meat was tender and juicy. The lobster was cooked just right. It came with mashed potatoes. Its pricey but it was worth it. Service was on point. Our waiter was attentive to our needs. We will be back the next time we're in town.",

Most of the time I will dine in the bar area since I'm usually alone.  Last two times I've been here the same bartender is lacking in service. Not rude, but not serving like someone working for tips. Did not offer water and took too long to come for my order. I'm not the only one. Heard others grumbling about the service. Maybe it's just his personality so wont hold it against restaurant which is worth a visit, but it did affect the overall experience.",

Lawry's is a fine dining experience a block off the strip in Vegas. If you order a prime rib dinner, it starts with a hand spun salad. The salad dressing is delicious and has a similar taste to thousand island. I love the beets and mix of lettuces. A prime rib cart comes and the chef will cut your size of meat. It's smothered in au jus with a side of creamy potatoes and gravy. Everything is so delicious. They also give you a piece of Yorkshire pudding to help soak up all of the juices.   We also got a fried artichoke heart appetizer that started the meal off perfectly. I can't speak highly enough about the food. It's so good!   There are many different cut sizes and I ordered the California cut which is the smallest. It's 6 oz but that was plenty for me. The regular Lawry's cut is 10 oz. I'm glad I opted for the smallest option!   I can't wait til the next time I get to come to this restaurant. It's so good!!!",

    "text": "You know when they say that something is not \"your grandfather's\" whatever it is? This is the opposite of that. This is exactly \"your grandfather's steak house.\"  Service was okay. Friendly, quiet, didn't over-explain anything. The women were dressed in wierd-ass faux-amish/mormon brown dresses with wierd napkin/headcovering/war-feather/pointy-halo things. I have no idea whatsoever they're going for with the getup. (EDIT: A bland version of Handmaid's Tale! That's what it remind me of!) No idea. It's wierd. It feels like this was a *thing* 50, 70, maybe 90 years ago. I don't get it, I don't get it to the point that it was off-putting.  Prices were... well, let's talk about the quality of the food, then we'll circle back around to the prices.  So the salad comes around, and they do the whole spinny-salad thing. It's pre-dressed with their half-French half-bland-ranch style house dressing. I put the suuuuper special salad pepper on it like they suggest. But I can't taste it at all, so I put more on. Still can't taste it, so more... oh, nice, yeah this does taste good. You know like when I usually put normal pepper on my salad. Except, wait for it! This pepper also has sugar in it. Ooooh. Sugar pepper.  The salad experience was odd, but not special - it was just a salad with \"Franch\" dressing on it and pepper. And sugar.  This was my first time here, so I got the prime rib, of course. Other things might be better, but this is the dang dish that is in their name, so they've perfected this right?  Nahhhhp.  They have table service on the prime rib. This is actually the best part of the entire experience. The server rolls over this gigantic monstrosity that looks like a cross between a Weber grill, a serving platter, an iron lung, and the space ship from Flight of the Navigator, in it are all of the prime ribs. You order what you want, he cuts it off, you get it. Great.  I'll admit, I didn't watch the process, but the steakspaceship (steak-ship?) was pretty awesome to behold.  The medium-rare prime rib that I got was about what I should expect it to look like, except its *swimming* in steak juices. I know that's a thing when you do prime rib, but it's a thing your grandfather does, not something that your friend that knows how to cook a perfect steak does. It's not a bad thing, it's just not a great thing, and it's grandpa-style. But not in the Macklemore thrift-shop kind of way. In a nursing-home boiled steak kind of way.  The steak wasn't really *good.* It was perfectly tender, but not very tasty. Remember Ponderosa steak house? About that tasty.  And the sides. Sure, mashed potatoes and gravy. Of course. Normal. The other two sides: creamed spinach and creamed corn.  There are no two sides on the planet that are more nursing-home-style food than creamed spinach, and creamed corn.  All of this for somewhere like $50. And this was the small prime rib. There were bigger ones that were way more.  I know Lawry's is a kind of institution, but here's the thing: institutions get stuck in doing things \"the way they always have\" - and maybe that will continue to work as long as people keep coming back to reminisce coming to the special steak house with their grandfather.   I get it. Grandpa was great. But the man grew up in the depression with canned everything, and he still liked to eat canned vegetables when there was fresh stuff because *he* was reminiscing about *his* childhood whenever he ate it.   Don't let your steakhouse choice be determined by 90-year-old memories of what your grandfather thought good food when he was growing up. It wasn't great then, and it's not worth $50 now.",

The dinning room is beautifully decorated, roomy, classic and elegant and great atmosphere as well. I always get seated right away upon my reservation. The staff is always quick, attentive, nice and absolutely professional.  The prime ribs here are absolutely delicious, tasty, juicy and tender. The seasoning is perfectly right, very consistent quality every time. The meat is so buttery soft, it's just melting in your mouth. Soooooooo yummy!!! I promise if you come here once, you won't go anywhere else for prime ribs no more. Their famous spinning bowl salad is always fresh and flavorful, I love it so much. It comes with your order as well as 2 sides of your choice. I usually got creamed corn and creamed spinach and extra mash potato are the 3 items to die for (OMG! They are soooooo goood). We also order lobsters, asparagus, mushrooms and of course their delicious deserts like creme brulee, hot fudge ice cream sundae. They are very tasty and my absolutely favorites.  I always have a wonderful experience dining here. It is the best prime ribs restaurant I've ever had. Top notch quality food and fantastic customer service.",

My group and I went on a Wednesday evening right after they opened at 5:30 pm. *They open at 5pm* We were seated quickly in a beautiful spacious dining room. The host pulled the table out from the space so the ladies in the group didn't have to slide into the booth seat. I enjoyed the manners of the staff.. very polite: please, thank you, sir, mam, Miss, ladies first. I wasn't expecting this kind of service to be honest. I figured it was just another chain steak house. Lawry's Prime Rib proved me wrong. With fabulous customer service! Our waiter was prompt polite and personable. All wait staff were prompt and professional. Anyway on to the food!  Delicious warm flakey French bread is served with butter to begin. All entrees come with a spinning bowl salad made table side with Lawry's own house dressing, it was delicious and definitely had the signature Lawry's seasoning flavor. If you are ordering a prime rib entree you place your order when the carving cart comes by. However if you are ordering any other entree, your order is placed with your waiter.  My whole group ordered prime rib dinners. I enjoyed that we all were able to choose our own cuts and temperature : petite, traditional, Lawry's cut(larger) and I believe theres larger cuts as well.  Each prime rib dinner is served with traditional mash potatoes and Yorkshire pudding with your choice of creamed corn or creamed spinach. Topped with Lawry's signature gravy.  The food was all top notch, simple but very delicious. I would definitely suggest Lawry's to friends and family coming into town as it is right off the strip.  Ps don't skip desert! The crime brulee was a real treat, topped with a few seasonal berries it was not too sweet and not to heavy to end our delicious dinner.",

The decor was elegant, service impeccable, and their unique table side serving was a nice surprise. Most importantly, the food was delicious!   I loved my experience here, and would like to give them 5 stars......BUT through no fault of their own, they are surrounded by a plethora of excellent restaurants (ok, maybe that is their fault), and I only give out 5's when I love the place so much that I want to go there all the time, forsaking all other competitors.   Conclusion: this is an excellent restaurant, and you should go. Even better, you should have your boss take you here and pick up the tab (I am a genius!)!",

News flash, no one does.   On to the review: a group of 6 went here for dinner, and all 6 of us agree, best meal we had in Vegas, and since we all come from different areas (NJ/MI/SC) we all agreed this is one of the best restaurants we all ever been to.  1st, the service is impeccable. Top notch. Made you feel at home. Wether you at the bar or dinner table. And yes, if you have a booth, they do pull the table out for you to help you get in. We did not get a booth since we had a large group, but watched it get done to others.   The waiter came out, introduced himself, and described the special appetizers. We got the shrimp cocktail, lobster brusetta, and seafood dish that had shrimp, oyster, and snow crab. All delicious.   He helped us with the menu. So many cuts of prime rib, certain sides are included, but you can order some others, like lobster tail, sauces, mushrooms etc.   We all got prime rib, with lobster tails, mushrooms.   Next the \"spinning salad\" salad with egg, croutons, and sliced beets, that they spin in a bowl, and add their house dressing... delicious.  When. It came time for the main course, the master Carver rolled out a cart, with the meats on it. You tell him what cut you wanted, and he slices it right there for you. Then he adds the mashed potatoes, and a choice of spinach, or creamed corn.  The creamed corn is not your canned mush. This was whole kernal, creamed corn in a thick sauce. Best I ever had.   The prime rib, absolutely perfect. Out of the 6 of us, we all had different cuts and all loved everything we had. The portions were huge.   In all, I wish we had one of these near us. I would definitely come back here next time we visit.",

Although I really enjoyed my visit that time, I never really think about this place when I think special occasion, since prime rib is so easy to make at home. However, this past Xmas, my wife convinced me that the little one would probably do better here than at te steakhouse I had reserved for us...so of course we ate here!  Well, she was right. The Xmas decor was quite festive, and with the unprecedented cold spell in Vegas, it really felt like Xmas. We were lucky enough to come by on a night that they had carolers! This really added to the ambience, as they were quite good and very accommodating with our requests (I seriously did not expect them to be able to sing Riu Riu Chiu!)  The food was just as good as I remembered it...the prime rib juicy and wonderfully tender. It tasted all the better because I saved twelve dollars and did not get suckered into ordering the Diamond Jim Brady cut! I remembered my buyer's remorse on my past visit when I saw that my more expensive order still resulted in the same size cut of beef as the standard Lawry's cut...I snickered as I saw this again to be the case!  Anyways, the food was wonderful, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The only thing that kept me from giving five stars was the distracted service. Our waiter only made sporadic cameos to our table...we had to ask other servers for our missing horseradish sauce, bread, and drink refills. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful evening and lovely holiday memory. Well worth coming back for!",

The prime rib is the BEST, great sides of creamed spinach & creamed corn, a pan of popover cooked in prime rib Au jus drippings & the spinner salad for starters. We've brought our family friends & in-laws here. I'm so glad I found this place a few years ago cuz there ain't nothing like it in Hawaii.",

The sides were excellent as well and they gave me extra gravy and au jus which I hoarded.  Get your mitts off my private gravy bowl!  Two horseradishes, one grated from the root and one creamed.  YUM!  We also had dessert.  Divide a dessert.  The pie my husband had was huge.  Banana Coconut Cream. Sigh!   With a bottle of wine and 2 desserts for 3 was $275.

We had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. They took a while to take our orders and they weren't even very busy. The quality of the food was disappointing. We ordered several Lawry's Cuts and they appeared to be much smaller than what we're used to receiving at the other location and my meat was tough and difficult to cut through. Overall, we were disappointed with the quality of the food and service given the amount of money we spent as a group of 17. I wouldn't recommend this location.",

But let's make this perfectly clear I'm paying for it therefore I should be able to request my steak my way. So out of spite I was served a charcoal briquette. THANK YOU LAWRY'S!

After our first recommended venue fell through, we headed over to Lawry's just off the strip.  I didn't know what to expect, but I was so thankful that we ended up here!    First off, art decOMG, this place is amazing.  I love art deco, so it is really up my alley.  Those calling for an update must hate classic architecture.  You heard me.  Lawry's is dripping with clean lines, metal accents and harkens back to a time when all the little touches added up to a genuine feel that is greater than the sum of its parts.  This is reflected in the walls, carpets, ceilings, tables, uniforms... everything is thought out.  The bar is superb.  Masterfully mixed cocktails by a friendly bar keep.    Once our table was ready, we were seated in the main room and watched as the servers and carvers made their way around to each table.  Our server was prompt, helpful and cheerful.  I also smile at the fact that they go by \"Ms.\" or \"Mr.\" rather than their more familiar first names.  A little formal touch that I liked.    Salad?  Great! Calamari?  Super tasty! That other thing we got for an appetizer that I can't remember?  Probably really good too!  But the real star is next.  If you get the salmon, or the chicken or something, just stop.  You want the prime rib.  Why?  It is in the name, first off!  Secondly, a giant (no kidding, he must have been 6'5\") wheels up a massive pillbug from space made of metal weighing 700 lbs to your table, opens up the top and cuts the beef right there!  Oh, was it good...  I got the Lawry's cut, not wanting one of the big portions.  It was more than enough to fill me up.  Did I do what my mother always told me and stop eating when I was full?  Hell no, I didn't!  I'm not going to waste something that good!  We all polished off the meal with a glass of bourbon.    What a great way to end the night.",

    "text": "I have finally found the answer to the question, \"Where's the beef?\" It's here people. Trust me!  I had dinner here with some of my suppliers during a recent business trip to Vegas. When I heard we would be dining here, I was a little nervous, for two reasons. I am always trying to watch what I eat and I knew it would be a belly buster type of meal, and also - I've never really actually ordered Prime Rib as my own entree. Sure, my husband has ordered it on numerous occasions but I have never ordered it on my own. I just can't commit myself to such a big hunky chunk of fine looking and tasting meat.   The decor of the restaurant is lovely. Very art deco, which does not mesh well with the amish like outfits that they make the servers wear. I didn't get it. But the service was pretty good. There were about 11 of us, and we had a great server and received some attention from the manager as well. We started with appetizers - a couple orders of shrimp cocktail and calamari. I am allergic to shrimp, but I must say they looked HUGE. The calamari was nothing unique, actually extremely breaded and fried, but still tasty (plus I was pretty hungry). For my main course I ordered the fish which was sturgeon. It was only OK. I felt it was overcooked. But what is saving this review from the abyss of 3-star ratings is that everything else was wonderful. I did get to get a little nibble of the prime rib which was fabulous. The horseradish is the real deal - I've had real horseradish before but this stuff was MEAN. They have creamed spinach which is like my absolute favorite side dish - and it was sooooo creamy and perfectly seasoned.   If you are in Vegas and want to experience a special night out that wont require you to hire an event planner or pay someone for reservations - this place was pretty good. I would return but I'm just going to commit and order the prime rib myself next time.",

First of all, all the waitresses are wearing these cute dresses with pyramid hats.. It's hard to explain but they look like sailor dresses and those triangular paper hats you folded in 2nd grade.  I went with my company so we reserved the private room and got the premium customer service.  The waitress was so nice and she had an assistant to help serve the food.  The private room has a showing of all the wines they have in stock.  I ordered the 16oz. LAWRY'S SIGNATURE RIB EYE STEAK instead of the 10oz. because it comes with the bone.. my co-worker suggested that if it includes the bone it stays tastier ( I guess only a steak expert would know that).  wOw the steak was amazing.  The steak special came with two sides.  The potatoes au gratin potatoes were great but the crisp fried onions were kinda funny.  I also tried... (I'll sound like a fatty after this confession): -SPINNING BOWL SALAD.. not too bland, not too salty, not too soggy.. just perfecto. -BRUSCHETTA (with tuna maybe?)-bleh didn't taste fresh -SIDE OF ONE LOBSTER... it's the small lobster (about 4 inches). I didn't like the chewy texture but others told me they liked it. -BANANA CREAM PIE-they say it's their most popular and they're very proud of it but beware this thing has coconut and LOTS of cream.  I can't wait to go back.. soo loving it right now. This place is only a short cab ride away from the strip and there's a strip club right across the street for the dudes.. haha.  The best part of this experience was that I took my leftover steak back to my hotel and it was some crazy drunk food to munch on at 4am back from the club.    **I just found out that they include their recipes on their website! woot woot! **Ooh, and they don't sell their seasoning anymore.. it was sold and is now owned by McCormick.",

    "text": "After living in Vegas for over 8 years (including living next door), I finally decided to try Lawry's.  It had been over three decades since I was at one (in LA) and I distinctively remembered the very comfortable atmosphere, the carts and carvers, the great service and the overall pleasant (and more upscale - white tableclothes) ambiance of the place.  Some traditions don't die, and it was nice to see Lawry's maintain its brand it has had for these past decades.   I do like that it was easy to have a conversation at our table at a normal level without tons of ambient noise from other tables and from music.  Briefly, service was excellent - very experienced, efficient and polished wait staff and assistants, comfortable seating (not all jammed in there, despite the busy-ness of the place), those large polished carts, and a cordial hostess and greeter.  As to the food:  I wasn't really impressed at all by the spinning salad - unique presentation, but dressing tasted like a mix between water-down french and thousand island, the fresh bread was tasty but would have been better with real butter instead of whipped, the creamed spinach was definitely a pass (dried out, small portion and only moderately tasty), the yorkshire pudding was ......., well don't have a reference point for that but wasn't terribly memorable but a nice touch.  Mashed potatoes and gravy were good (a bit on the salty side).  Lastly, the prime rib - traditional cut/end cut - was terrific!!!!  Probably the most tender prime rib (and for an end cut) I have tasted, and certainly that alone is worth going back.   Before we were served, I questioned why we all didn't receive sharper steak knives - I now understand that sharp knives are necessary for what we had ordered.   Our group didn't try any other meat dish, so no comment on those.  All in all, definitely a repeat place for Prime Rib.  Low expectations for all the other stuff, but the PR shines head and shoulders above all.",

It was just like eating at Red Rock buffet. The cut of the meat was uneven and thin with mashed potato and creamed corn.  Nothing exciting.  Worst is, our server is rude. We were still talking to him and  he's already walking away.  Then we would ask him again and he would give us the cold shoulder.  We all enjoyed the wedding except the food and service.",

She was very good and made the experience enjoyable.  She did not however start off with the customary \"may I bring you something from the bar\".  My friend wanted a martini so he had to ask her if she would bring him one.   We both had prime rib.  He had the English cut and I had the traditional Lawry's cut.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the meat.  The sizzling skillet of mushrooms was also good but I found the asparagus to be undercooked.   I enjoyed creme brule for desert and he had the hot fudge sundae.  Both were very good.   I would recommend Lawry's to locals and visitors alike for a great dining  experience.",

Tasted like something in an elementary school cafeteria.  The concept of the restaurant is beyond cheesy, and isn't suited for 2016. Adding insult to injury, I listened to the server pitch some kind of \"club card\" or something to that effect to the table next to us.  WTF is management thinking?  Meanwhile (as she worked diligently to get them their card), we sat unattended waiting for the disgusting salad.  Perhaps she was doing us a favor?  I'm sure our server Ms. Fodor is forced to hawk this bs card, and as such don't blame her.  She was actually a decent server, and her assistant (Miguel?) was awesome.  Bottom line - the food is not worth the money.  Go to South Pointe or The Orleans if you are looking for prime rib.  Lawry's please get into the 21st century.",

    "text": "I'd been holding off on writing a review as I wanted it to be something cool for number 200. This place has earned that right.  While there may be many places in Vegas you can get \"prime rib\" for $10, I can guarantee you the quality and service doesn't hold a candle to a dinner at Lawry's.  The first thing that strikes you when you walk in is the feel of the place. It looks like it was transported in from the 1940's. We arrived very early for our reservation hoping to be seated earlier, alas to no avail. However, we were directed to the lounge area to enjoy a predinner cocktail. (Bonus points to anyone who can guess what I ordered.)  Upon being seated we were introduced to our server, Ms. Backman. Not Susan, or Stephanie, or Alice. Her name was Ms. Backman.   Ms. Backman introduced us to the menu and let us know we could choose our cut of prime rib when the carver wheeled the roaster around to our table. We started off with some shrimp cocktail which was good. The one issue I did have with it was the cocktail sauce didn't have enough horseradish, ironically enough.  After finishing our appetizer, Ms. Backman came back to prepare our spinning salad and deliver our wine (bottle of J Lohr cab). Shortly after the salads Ms. Backman came back to introduce us to Juan, our carver. He opened up the roaster to present us with a three skewers of meat, mashed potatoes and other sides if you were interested. We both went with the The \"Diamond Jim Brady\" Cut, which includes the bone. It was served with mashed potatoes and doused with au jus, with horseradish (creamed and straight) on the side.   The meat was unbelievably flavorful and tender. It certainly didn't need any horseradish, but as I love horseradish I couldn't resist. The mashed potatoes were of course perfect (you have to work hard to mess up mashed potatoes), and the gravy awesome.  Trust me - resist the urge to visit a $10 buffet to get your prime rib. You get what you pay for, and this place is worth the extra money.",

I ordered my prime rib, MEDIUM and got bloody red, RAW meat that was not even warm.  the table next to us had to send back their meat twice for being too raw.   The potatoes were BORING,  the cream corn was ok, but on the menu it looks like its included in the meal, and on the bill it was $12.00 extra.  The yorkshire pudding was DRY and boring.   The waiter and bus boy, barely spoke english.  How about hiring some Americans!  They gave us a free desert for our anniversary,  but it wasn't even edible.  One bite confirmed it was gross.   They wouldn't accept the gift cards we had for the whole amount.  said they could only use $40 of the $50 on the card.  The one good thing....the BONE that the dog liked just fine.  If you want good Prime Rib in Vegas...save your money and have the $12.99 cut at Binions coffee shop, even cheaper with your players card.",

The prime rib and mashed potatoes were excellent. Ms. Pierson was our server. Her service was average. Not as pleasant or attentive as other servers. Maybe because we had the TZ deal and only party of 3. Added on the creamed corn but was disappointed with it. Corn wasn't very fresh or sweet. The coconut banana cream pie was very disappointing. It was mostly whipped cream with blackish bananas and hardly any custard filling. Seems like it was made days earlier. The chocolate macadamia pie was awful too. Good thing Mom ordered the hot fudge sundae. She loved it especially with the toasted almonds. Might think about coming back for a special occasion especially with a deal.",

Some might think that it's pretty cool that you can see your own meat being cut.  But for me, personally, I'd much rather not see my meat being cut in front of me. I'd rather see it brought out on a plate from the kitchen, and I'd like to be made to think that my piece of meat was thrown in to be cooked after my order was set in place. Maybe it's because the first thought that crossed my mind were the old days when I went to Hometown Buffet or something, where they sliced the roast beef/turkey for you. I don't know. The whole idea of having the carver going around with his cart full of meat cutting it for people kinda cheapened the experience for me. Call me snobby. I got the Lawry cut at medium rare with corn and mashed potatoes&gravy.  As soon as I took my first bite, my petty grievances went out the window. At steak houses I normally don't opt for the prime rib. But they do it right here; it's their thing! I felt that our server wasn't too friendly at all. There was also a little mix up among the servers. Supposedly they wait til everyone finishes their salad before bringing the meat carver around. We wanted to keep our salads to eat with our steak and we told a server that 2 different times, but I guess that memo didn't get to our main server, so we kinda had to wait a little longer for the meat to come around to us. No biggy. They also sang happy bday for me & provided a free cake which was yummy. I'd love to come back here, but probably the one closer to home for me in LA.",

The banana and coconut pie is too much....its overly sweet and the whipped cream filling is stiff and disgusting. It looks impressive, you gotta try it once and then you'll be over it. fast. I will gladly return for this awesome piece of meat.",

    "text": "We dined at Lawry's this past Friday, we had 8:30 reservations to avoid the Friday nite crowding.  Upon arrival we were informed that we were lucky to have avoided the earlier rush and the Hostess was so glad she was going home soon but that she could not be sure we would be able to get a booth that we had reserved.  After a 10 to 15 minute wait we were seated at a booth.  A gentleman arrived with some butter and informed us our server would be coming and would we like to order cocktails.  We did order some wine and our server Rhonda came to take our order.  Rhonda was the only pleasant experience of the evening.  I ordered fish that came raw in the middle and was told by a manager that I was wrong and it was cooked correctly.  My husband's prime rib was very fatty and unattractive.  The bread never made it to the table.  Poor Rhonda spent most of her time apologizing for all the mishaps that were not her fault.  Overhaul a terrible food experience but Rhonda's service was great.",

If you are expecting very traditional, classic environment, this one bends towards art deco and the waitresses wear an odd 50's diner style uniform.  It was good.  That's about all I can say.

They had a vegetarian entree that was just roasted mixed veggies and rice pilaf!  The service was excellent! Our waiter was soooo great!  Probably one of the nicest restaurants in LV! Even though I don't eat meat, I thought it was really cool how they bring the meat on a cart and slice it all right in front of you! To top off the awesome dinner, our family ordered 3 different desserts, all desserts were so amazing, but I'm a huge coconut fan and had the coconut banana cream pie and it was the best pie I've ever had in my entire life! The pie crust was coconut shreds which really brought out the coconut flavors! My sister got the lava cake , and it came out so warm and sooooo yummy for the chocolate lovers! And then my mom got the toffee pudding pie and that was AMAZING as well! Ugh , this place is definitely a must go! I have absolutely no complaints and I hope to come here again!!!!",

    "text": "Excellent place for prime rib.   I recently came here while on a trip during spring break with my boyfriend. Upon arrival, the hostess was very kind and welcoming. Our table wasn't ready just yet so we sat in the very comfortable chairs in the waiting area. Once our table was ready, the dining room was just lovely.   Our server was very nice. My boyfriend and I aren't much wine drinkers but since we were there, why not have some to go along with our prime rib. Our server helped us find a wine that we liked, offered his suggestions and we were able to get one that went relatively well with our meal.  Here's the good part.  The prime rib was to die!!! They wheel around this huge steel cart which carries the huge load of prime rib and they cut it table side. I believe it was $40 or so depending on the cut and you get one or two sides.. We ordered some extra sides so we had a lot of food between two people.   The prime rib just melts in your mouth!!!!!  All I can remember is not wanting to waste any bit of it even though I was about to burst. And the pricing was reasonable too. Compared to other restaurants that charge an arm and a leg for a piece of meat that isn't as close to melt in your mouth as Lawrys, this is well worth it.",

We were seated on time and the service was above excellent. From the moment we were seated until the moment we left, we were treated like royalty.  The calamari appetizer was tasty. Nothing spectacular. The mayonnaise based dipping sauce and tomato based sauce was just OK.   I got the California cut prime rib and my husband got the Lawry's cut prime rib. They were excellent, tender, and juicy. The mashed potatoes, gravy, and creamed corn was also delicious!  We also had a side of creamed spinach which had a little bitterness to it. I think it was from the onions.   Overall it was a very tasty dinner but very overpriced. You're really paying for the service which was superb. For the three of us our bill was at $240 not including tip. Wow! We probably won't eat there again because of the cost. In Vegas, you can get prime rib almost anywhere for much less. It was great to try and we have no regrets.",

    "text": "Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:  *** 4.5 stars ***  This is truly a throwback to a bygone era.  Classy, old school, soft lighting, nice music quietly playing so you can have a conversation--you know--like the good old days.  Course 1:  The Original Spinning Bowl Salad--Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with our exclusive Vintage Dressing (from the Lawry's menu.  The server wheels a cart with a stainless bowl of greens.  This bowl is in a second bowl that has ice to keep the greens chilled.  The server spins the bowl in the ice and lifts the Lawry's salad dressing high and pours it over the spinning bowl.  It's plated and served.  Very old school way of doing things but it's lots of fun.    Course 2:  I chose the Lawry cut of prime rib--a 10 ounce slice of prime rib.  The other option was salmon but why the hell would I come to this restaurant to eat salmon?  The ribs are wheeled in a large covered cart to your table where the server asks you how you want the prime rib done and what sides you want.  I went with the standard mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  While the chef was cutting the meat and putting the sides together, my server, Mrs. Bender (sort of like Charlotte Rae from \"The Facts of Life\" TV show) went off to the kitchen to get my Yorkshire pudding, something I haven't had in years.  The chef placed the meat on my table, and she used two forks to cut the pudding into four roughly equal pieces/.  She had already brought a mild and strong horseradish, so I was ready to dig in.  The meat was tender.  No steak knife is needed here and the potatoes and creamed spinach were top notch!  Course 3:  How can you get to dessert and not choose a chocolate bag.  Too bad it wasn't the size of a Macy's shopping bag but you can't have everything!  The menu describes the bag this way:  Filled with a double rich Belgium mousse, fresh assorted berries with a raspberry Chambord sauce, topped with mint and shaved chocolate.  The bag is a rectangular shaped piece of chocolate filled with the goodies described.  It was superb!  The whole experience was pleasant from being greeted at the door and the woman who verified my reservation.  I especially liked the sign telling men to take the damn hats off before entering the dining room.  It's a shame the sign has to be there, but I liked it!  Mrs. Bender was a gem.  She was like a little house mother with her cart, her spinning bowl, her orchestrating the various aspects so the cart got to me and the meat was what I wanted before she dashed to get the Yorkshire pudding.  Service was impeccable.    Note:  The good old days weren't as good as we think they were.  We're just getting older and the past seems a gentler time.",

The prime rib was very tender and good, the sides was they could have left in the back, I could popped open a can of Del Monte cream corn and made it better. Mashed Potatoes im sure was made from one of those brands that you make in a microwave instantly. Seeing the lilttle spinning salad bowl thinking we going to get a good salad be but all we got was a spin of .... shit, wasnt good!!  SERVICE. The waiter was some what rude, he was irritated because he actually had to serve us, right after we got our food, the cook came out and told us to not tip him because he racist..how an hispanic can be racist?? The after we got our bill we seen the $15 split plate charge and disputed it as we wasnt explained this. The Asst. Manager was addressed and instead of pulling him to the side and discuss, he reprimanding him right at our table!! Very unproffesional and need to be RE-TRAINED. Oh forgot to mention it was the guys last day on the job...Yea my wife already trying to contact their cooporate office to voice her concern.  OVERALL Well the prime rib seem like the only thing good, the rest of it need to be worked on and get some servers in there that are passionate and want to satify customers.",

The California cut was perfect for me but my son got the  Diamond Jim Brady cut. Both roasted to perfection, medium rare. Salad as expected, mashed potatoes exceptional and what more can I say about the Yorkshire pudding except when can we return? Oh the calamari was perfectly done with two sauces. Do try the Cool as a Cucumber Martini made with Hendrix Gin. Without a doubt the best \"flavored\" martini I have ever had. We will be back for more incredible food and exceptional service.",

So great that you'll want to go to Lawry's just for the side. Tip: get the creamed corn on a separate plate so it doesn't mix in with your Au Jus. If you like a little extra kick with your prime rib, ask for some Tabasco sauce to mix in with the creamy horseradish.   Service is always spot on with the friendly staff.",

Were greeted by a very friendly hostess, who acknowledged they were running a few minutes behind but we didn't mind and really appreciated the heads-up.  The fresh sourdough bread to start was warm and the Spinning Bowl Salad was very good.  I'm not a fan of beets, but the French dressing was so tasty, that I really didn't mind the beets.  My wife had the California Cut, while I ordered the Lawry's Cut.  Both Prime Ribs were cooked perfectly.  We also enjoyed a side of the Sizzling Skillet Mushrooms and my wife also got the creamed spinach.  Together with the Yorkshire Pudding and Mashed Potatoes, it made for a very delicious meal.    We split the Key Lime Pie for dessert, which was excellent.  Needless to say, it was one of my favorite Prime Ribs ever.",

Friends got the prime rib and neither of them were impressed. We have had our fair share of good steaks in Houston, so in comparison this was average at best.   Waiter was slow and charged us for a drink he made wrong. Seriously..when 5 people are spending 50 bucks a steak, the least you can do is not charge for 1 cocktail that was made wrong.

The meal can be a bit pricey, but you definitely get your money's worth and don't leave hungry. We decided to visit during restaurant week and it was the best decision. Prime rib and lobster tail along with a dessert for $50 per person! You can't beat that, we enjoyed every minute. It's definitely not an everyday meal but it's also not just for special occasions. We love it here and will continue to go for many years!!",

And I'm hoping...that I can convince my friends to go to Lawry's at least one time for a meal.  I first discovered Lawry's two vegas trips ago when my college roommate had his bachelor party there and one of his groomsmen picked out this restaurant.  It turned out to be the best meal we had on the trip and one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life.  Hands down the best the prime rib I've ever had.  The table side service is unique, the cuts of steak are tender and juicy, the au jus is delicious, the sides are fresh, and the \"spinning\" salad is incredible.  There's really no reason I can think of not to like Lawry's.  I can't wait until I get to eat here again.",

They start you off with their table side prepared spinning bowl salad which was very good.  They recommend you use Lawry's seasoned pepper on it which did make it taste even better.  The Prime Rib I ordered medium.  It was sooooooo good.  Melt in your mouth tender.  It really was a slice of meaty heaven.  I enjoyed seeing it cut table side for me.They give you hot and mild creamed horseradish so I combined them and that was perfect.  Unfortunately, I could only finish half my dinner.  I took it to go because I could not stand to leave it.  It deserved to be eaten.  Service was great and the dining experience was a real pleasure.  Dinner with a glass of cab and tip was $75.  I highly recommend it if you're looking for Prime Rib to remember!",

But I would recommend dressing nice! We had a reservation for 8:00 but got there early, around 7:20. The waiting area is nicely furnished with several comfortable couches & chairs so the wait was fine. We were seated promptly at 8 on the dot. The guy who seated us was great, very friendly and asked us where we were from, etc. Also, it's cool how they pull out the table to seat you :P   Our waitress was fantastic, super enthusiastic, friendly, and nice :) the sourdough bread & butter they give you is yummy & fresh, generous portion too. Food did not take long at all to come even though it was packed! The bf & I got prime rib of course! It comes with their signature spinning bowl salad, which was really cool. They mix it right at your table in a big bowl. The salad was fresh and crisp, and the croutons and dressing were yummy! Also a very generous portion. I definitely couldn't finish it all.  The prime rib also comes with mashed potatoes w/ gravy and yorkshire pudding. Both delicious!! I had the English Cut prime rib which is 3 thin slices (6.5 oz for $39). The bf had the beef bowl cut (biggest cut - 22 oz for $58). We also had sides of creamed spinach & corn ($6 ea) and caramelized onions ($2 - realllyyy good!), and the bf also had a lobster tail (I think it was $12) - he said this was the best lobster he has ever had. It's awesome how they carve the prime rib right in front of your table. Even the carver guy was super nice. This dinner was for our anniversary so everyone made it a point to tell us happy anniversary, which I thought was really nice :)  The prime rib was good, but not the best I've had. I got mine medium well, but it was still on the tough side. Because of the price, I had expected it to be melt-in-your-mouth-good prime rib -- My favorite prime rib everrr was from Cattle Company Steakhouse on Oahu. So sorry Lawry's, but the prime rib I got didn't beat theirs! :P That's why I took off one star.   Overall I think you are definitely paying for the dining experience here. The service is outstanding and this was definitely THE BEST restaurant experience I have EVER had, hands down. It is pricey but you will not leave disappointed because they take care of you so well here. We even got a complimentary dessert for our anniversary! It was awesome :) Even though it is expensive, I would definitely come back here just for the experience.",

I ordered the Diamond Brady thick cut medium rare. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now. It was cooked to perfection and was packed with flavor. I had creamed spinach which was good.

    "text": "I came here last night (Saturday) for dinner with a group of 7.  The guys in the group said the specialty was their prime rib and so we all had that except for one person in our party.  That one person had steak and while it looked good, the prime rib tasted better according to another friend.    Each prime rib dish includes some of their 'famous spinning salad', mashed potatoes, and bread.  The spinning salad in my opinion was less than great.  Salad drenched in thousand island dressing ... hmm.  It's cool how they toss the salad but as far as taste goes, it's 'ok'.  Next, the prime rib?  I was expecting something amazing ... and it was not.  For one, my sis ordered hers well done and I ordered mine medium well.  Yet my sisters was redder than mine... and I guess the waiter overheard our table surveying which looked more well done because he switched it up for something way darker.  The bread it comes with, yorkshire?  Or something like that, it's pretty good.  We added some lobster tails, they weren't bad but again we've had better.    Based on other reviews, I was expecting the service to be superb, something along the lines of a Ruth's Chris.  However, I felt the service was lacking.  A bit slow and the waiter kept bringing me diet coke instead of regular, after I asked him specifically for a refill of regular coke, since it seemed he was overwhelmed and didn't take notice of things like refills.  It actually wasn't even busy.    We had stopped at the bar before being seated and the drinks were pretty good.  We tried a raspberry mojito, yum!    Overall, an 'okay' experience.  I wouldn't return.  Also, if you call ahead for reservations, be prepared to give them your name and credit card number.  I thought it was weird but that's their policy.  The only good thing is that they advise you of the suggested 18% gratuity and you can let them know at that time you prefer they not include that and they won't.",

Through my entire planning process Michelle made herself available to assist.  Michelle and the rest of the staff at Lawry's have a passion for making each event a success.  They have wonderful customer service and above all they are very flexible.  Unlike several Vegas venues, Lawry's allows you to bring in your own wedding vendors & decorations.    All of my guests were amazed how a restaurant could transform their main dining room into a fabulous wedding ceremony location.  The food was absolutely delicious. We had Prime Rib, Salmon and Chicken as featured entrees. All 3 entrees were perfect in which all of our guests gave rave reviews.  If you have it in your budget, get the prime rib carvers, they added a really nice presentation to the reception.  Lawry's is definitely one of the elite wedding venues in Las Vegas.  Thank you so much Lawry's & Michelle for a fabulous wedding experience. You made planning a wedding from a distance easy!  Mrs. Eulina Davis Wedding 7/28/2012 Destination Wedding in Las Vegas",

We were looking forward to our key lime pie but what we got was something completely different.  I'm not sure if it was cheesecake but what I do know is it was very dense and very unpleasant.  It didn't taste at all like key lime pie as it was listed in their menu.  I hope Lawry's takes this review on board and changes the wording of their Falsely advertised dessert.  It was a disappointing end to our meal and has both my father and uncle swearing off Lawry's indefinitely.",

I think I chewed it with my tongue. The sides were ok, I think I had the mashed potatoes and some other vegetable. Because I am a cook though, and because I'm a little more frugal with my money, this was an experience that will be left as an experience.",

Started with house made chips and a Pimm's Cup in the bar.  The salad show always sets off the festivities. They even made concessions to leave the egg out of one my fellow diner's salad plate. Once seated, the three of us each ordered Lawry's 24oz ribeye. All three plates came out medium rare plus as ordered.  The entire meal was spot on. A great meal without a great expense. We each enjoyed dining at Lawry's.",

This place is old school - tradition , service , menu and waitresses who have rare turnover ! So , when I had a choice of a grilled, crispy skin Bronzino whole fish ( sea bass) I went for it ! And it was awesome !! It was an experience for a party of 8 - the table was wobbly ( they set a round plywood  table on a square table ) - surprised. Check out the desserts - well worth it !",

Maybe it wasn't entirely necessary and eating a giant slab of prime rib doesn't seem like the best combination in our nicest duds but we were in Vegas after all.  The service was great and our server was very attentive and informative.  We both got the classic cut and it was massive.  It was more fatty than I like and I kept giving those bits to my husband.  Honestly, this was the first time I have ever had prime rib and I will say that it isn't my favorite cut of beef but it was pretty good.  The sourdough bread is delicious and the spinning salad was cool, although I could do without the beets.   We were also celebrating our anniversary and even got a slice of cake on the house!     Another bonus for me?  In a town ruled by Pepsi products, they actually serve Coke products.  My tired brain needed the caffiene bad but getting if from Pepsi wasn't going to happen.",

    "text": "So I've heard  this place has the greatest prime rib?  I will say it was definitely a solid cut of beef and would return on a special occasion.  Being in town for business, our team dinner was here and service was kind of spotty with a larger group.  I'll keep this review short, but my meal was definitely memorable because of the sides.  The corn is a must get here, it's delicious.  Again, GET THE CORN!  It's creamy, thick, and freaking buttery.  The creamed spinach was also great, not the best I've had, but a nice side with the prime rib.  The freebie mashed potatoes were, well, I didn't even eat much of it because it was free, what a snob.    My medium rare cut was medium rare, couldn't argue there.  Mr. Bob cut me a nice fat diamond jim brady's slice and it was demolished.  This has the bone-in, but for the price, it wasn't worth $52.  My colleague next to me the Lawry's cut, but also got the bone.  It was maybe a tad thinner, hardly noticeable and $10 cheaper.  I got the diamond jim because of the bone attached.  Oh, the yorkshire pudding (bread) was rubbish, don't waste your calories intake on that piece.",

Now to the main course... we both ordered the lawry special cut and let me state we came early so the meat had just been prepared we were 2 of 5 people in the restaurant and if you've never been to lawrys they have roll carts with a carving station where the cook with literally carve your prime rib at your table and well my meat was overcooked and that made it very chewy and un edible and for $44 dollars not worth it at all! got mashed potatoes for a side dish might as well been straight powdered potatoes cause thats what it tasted like and the consistency was horrible! The only reason why this place even got 2 stars is the service, our waitress in training so we got 2 of them, I love the fact that they pride themselves in service but it gets bad sometimes where you cant even enjoy a meal without someone consistently coming to your table \"hows you meal sir\" uhh i have'nt even cut my prime rib yet jeeze but ill still give it to them because good service is better than bad service. Overall don't think ill be going back to lawrys anytime soon so back to my quest to finding the best prime rib in vegas!",

The cranberry-orange mojito was a nice holiday drink.  The waiter was knowledgeable, attentive, and helpful.  The spinning salad was cute, they spin the salad in a bowl over ice as they pour the dressing.  The prime rib is brought to you table side in these huge silver meat cooker/warmers.  You pick your cut and rareness from this cooker.  It came with Yorkshire pudding, and vegetable. The month of December they have carolers that roam the restaurant, and will come table side also to sing you a Christmas carol.  They say proper dress code is required, but looks like they forgo this to some extent. It is a bit pricey but glad we had this experience.",

We all brought a few bottles of special wine ($15 corking fee per bottle). Not to say their wine list is off but it's not the best in my opinion.   Our waitress was funny, attentive and a very good sport considering we were throwing down some serious wine. We all had the prime rib, of course. WHO in their right mind would get anything else? The spinning salad served prior to dinner is made table side and it never disappoints. I HATE BEETS but why do I love them in this salad? I will have to explore that at a later time.   Anyway, as expected, food was fab, service even better and they sang me a little song for my birthday and brought me a nice piece of cake.   I am a big fan of this place and I even steal the recipes from their website to make my own creamed spinach, creamed horseradish and prime rib. Mine MIGHT be better! Bobby Flay Throwdown?!? Perhaps!

Yes, they have other things on the menu, but they're filler designed to appease the rare vegetarian in your party.  Don't expect an ever-changing menu of innovative California cuisine or Asian-fusion.  Eat the prime rib and have the delicious sides.    Oh, and if you're a frequent diner, sign up for the Lawry's card.  It's a one-time fee of $25, but they'll immediately mail you a gift card for $25, so it's a wash.  Also, if you present the card every time you eat there, you'll get points that will automatically be converted to more gift cards.  We get at least $25 every time we eat there.",

Various side orders came in such as a mushroom dish cooked sizzling, and a side of asparagus.  I got the famous Lawry's prime cut prime rib dinner.  Medium well with a side of mashed potaotes.  The prime rib was succulent and juicy and literally melted like butter upon tasting it.  That was a great tasting meal!  Worth every penny I spent here.

The booths are big and roomy. The ceiling is really high and a bit art deco. It's not too loud and they play vocal or big band era music.   The menu is uncomplicated and so is their wine list.

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that as a POOR med student, I have never been able to afford these expensive restaurants, unless I score the hookups for pharm dinners. I personally would never spend a dime here. That being said, I do retain the ability to enjoy the finer things in life...at least as much as I can afford it. ;)  So, on to the review. I was there on account of a presidential dinner for one of the professional societies I am a member of. EVERYTHING was free, including alcohol. I had two glasses of their house Riesling, which was absolutely PERFECT. Riesling is my favorite kind of wine, and I may venture to say this was my favorite brand that I drank last night.  Appetizers consisted of chicken skewers, an asparagus and salmon puff pastry type thing, and a mushroom topped bread hor d'oeuvre.  The salad had walnuts, tomatoes, and bacon bits. Simply scrumptious with the bread basket they passed around.  DINNER: I don't eat beef, so I opted for the salmon dish, which came with veggies, and these delicious whipped potatoes. The salmon was flavorful and practically melted in my mouth. I think it had some kind of curried thai sauce on top of it...whatever it was, it was yummy! My friends who had the ribs loved them. I also tried the popovers and creamed corn...the creamed corn was sooooo good...I kept stealing it off of my friend's plate.  Dessert was this big slice of chocolate cake and a side of strawberries and a strawberry sauce...to top it all off, I had a yummy cup of coffee.  The service was fantastic, and the waiters and waitresses were VERY attentive, refilling our glasses before we even had to so much as look at them to get us another one. It was a very enjoyable dinner, probably even more enjoyable due to the fact that I didn't have to pay for any of it. :)",

Service is very good and our waitress was attentive while making us feel welcome.   We began our meal with a salad accompanied with an overwhelmingly strong and sweet heavy dressing. It was a cross between a Russian and Thousand Island dressing of the 1960's.   Next, came the silver cart where our Prime Rib was carved to order. My wife and I ordered the Diamond Jim, a18oz PR on the bone, to share with our kids. It was just enough and we were not charged for sharing.   My older son loved the Prime Rib and the experience so I added the fourth star. Personally the Prime Rib was a little above average but maybe my expectation was too high. The deserts were the highlight of the night. Both the chocolate bag and the coconut / banana pie were outstanding. The coconut banana pie is filled with fresh coconut shavings and the crust tasted like a macaroon.",

If I just ate the salad, I'd be happy, but this is not why I came here.  - Strong Dirty Dirty Martini. I could only take two sips. I didn't finish it, but it was one of the best martinis everRRR.  - nice high ceilings so there was good ventilation and it wasn't some dark gloomy stuffy steakhouse where you couldn't breathe. i could also see my date clearly without having a candle burning in between us. been there done that. it's creepy, not romantic.  - Waitress was the sweetest and the nicest. I liked it when her eyes bugged out when I ordered the Jim Brady cut. She asked me if I was sure. I said well I like the bone, give me the bone. She said if I wanted a lawry cut with the bone and I said fine, just as long as I get the bone, my favorite part.  - the carver gave us HUGE pieces both with bones. my date didn't even ask for the bone. i ate more than he did. yummy spicy horseradish and creamy horseradish. we were both charged the regular lawry cut price.  - spinach that tasted like bacon. woah!  conclusion: i'm a bay area native and hands down this place was BY FAR way better than house of prime rib. boo-ya!",

That is how it is done, none of this cutting the yorkies into pieces business.   The decor was semi fancy and the service was brilliant. Our servers all had a sense of humour, which you need when faced with a group of 15 guys out for shenanigans.  This place is a must when you visit Vegas.",

Waitress said there would be a $15 dollar Fee for this? Not to mention that we had already ordered alcoholic beverages, so we are by no means cheap. BUT $15 dollars to split a meal in half? Im sorry but no thanks, When I go to fine dining I expect the service to be great, if THEY ARE SO CHEAP, they cant split a meal in half, i dont want anything to do with the place. I had to leave on principle alone. There was hardly anyone there and now I can see why.   Dear Management, I would to have loved to enjoy your food but something needs to change within your customer service. The waitress was also flat and had zero personality. By the way, your outfits are SUCK. Needless to say I will not be returning and will steer people away from your establishment.",

By Las Vegas standards, the price was fair.  An enormous amount of very high quality food, fresh, hot and delicious.  We were very impressed that they offered my 11 year old daughter a \"childs portion\", which included drink and desert and an entree portion almost identical to the \"california cut\" for less than half the price.  A nice accomodation not seen often anymore.  To me, Lawry's is and always will be the anti-Vegas.  I make it a point to visit there on every trip.  Cheers. One particular thing that stood out",

You can order off the menu, which features steaks and seafood.  Otherwise, what people usually get, is a cut of prime rib.  We started with a house salad that they coin as a spinning salad or something.  The just make it table side with a heavy hand with dressing.  It's okay but it's pretty salty and not \"light\".  But that comes with the meal anyways.  The prime rib also includes mashed potatoes and you can add other sides like creamed spinach, buttered peas, or creamed corn for extra.  I tried the potatoes, spinach, and the creamed corn off of someone else's plate.  The creamed corn was just a lot of corn in a lot of cream.  It was okay but nothing to write home about.  Cream of spinach was heavy so I could only have a couple of bites, but it tasted alright.  Potatoes were good, all the sides were just run of the mill and rich.  The Prime rib was really tender and the au jus was really yummy.  My friend and I split the Lawry's bowl cut (the really large piece) and that worked well, with left overs to take home even.  They let you choose how you want the piece to be cooked and carve it at the table for you.  They also include a little bit of yorkshire pudding that is pretty good.  Just save room for it because they served it to us after we already ate half the meal.  I wish I was hungrier.    But I would definitely go back for the prime rib.  So tender and tasty.  Everything else was pretty okay.",

    "text": "My wife and I, along with our two kids (4yrs and 7 yrs) ate here on 8/6/07. We were in Las Vegas and I was craving prime rib. I was not going to trust a casino serving up $6.95 prime rib to satisfy my craving. So, I put on jeans and a collared shirt so we could dine here. I have been to the Lawry's in Beverly Hills too many times to remember, but this is my first time to their Vegas location.  LOCATION: The restaurant is located just off of the strip. There is only ONE entrance I could find to their parking lot, which was on Howard Hughes Drive. I drove by the restaurant the first time and it took me 5 minutes to make my way back.  ATMOSPHERE: This is very similar to their Beverly Hills location. It is kind of like a throwback to the great steakhouses of the 1950's with red velvet booths and oil paintings. They have a separate bar area. They did not serve the potato chips and meatballs in the bar that they do at their other location.  The atmosphere and staff are genuine, the waitresses (there are no waiters) have oftentimes been there many years. The staff is all dressed in classic formal uniforms. Despite this, I felt comfortable eating here in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt with my kids (they are well behaved), my dress may not have been appropriate for their BHills location though.  SERVICE: The service as always was top-notch. I have never had bad service at a Lawry's. They did not have a sommelier on-staff (or at least working that night). I had some questions about a wine and the waitress was happy to get the answer from the manager.  Since we had our kids with us, we dined later (at 9:00) so the restaurant was not too crowded. They were able to seat us in a nice booth so that we would not disturb others, since some people may dread seeing smaller children brought into nicer places.  FOOD: I am on a constant look out for someone with better prime rib. Claim Jumper (a LA chain) comes a little close, but not nearly close enough. No one does prime rib better than Lawry's, period. The quality of their meat is the key, it is so silky. If you order it medium or cooked even more, I do not know what you will end up with. The only way to eat meat of this quality is medium rare.  Prime rib is a roast and it is slow-roasted. Because of this, there is no way for them to cook the meat when you order it. They do such a quantity of prime rib that they pull them out of the oven and right onto large silver carts. The carts keep the meat warm and allow the server to carve it right at your table. You can choose any type of doneness you want.  I had the beef bowl cut, their biggest with the rib bone attached. I generally do not recommend ordering anything other than prime rib, but my wife ordered the lobster tails. We then performed a swap and she had some prime rib and I had some tails.  The sides were great as always, but the star of the dinner is always the meat. As usual, it was as tender and tasty as can be.  My only complaint was that when I had a silver dollar sized piece of meat left, it seemed to have continued to cook and was now medium and not medium rare. This can happen if the meat is taken out of the oven and carved too soon (since it continues to cook for a while). I am sure they would have replaced this piece, but since it was small I declined to ask.  RECOMMENDATION: If you are looking for the best prime rib, look no further. If you are looking for cheap prime rib, look elsewhere. If you love prime rib, and have never eaten here, you are truly missing out.",

We started with cocktails in the cozy bar - though I didn't see their French martini on the menu, the bartender was quick to accommodate.  Once seated in the dining area in one of their traditional \"show room\" booths, we started our meal by sharing a shrimp cocktail appetizer - five huge shrimp and just right spicy cocktail sauce.  This was followed by the traditional spinning salad bowl with egg, shredded beats, and the Lawrys French dressing.  Sour dough bread and butter were included.  We chose the prime rib with accompaniments of the traditional creamed spinach and asparagus topped with hollandaise.  The homemade mashed potatoes are fabulous.  I love the English cut of prime rib.  It is three thinner slices and just seems to soak up the juices.  One of the party added a medium sized lobster tail for $16.  As expected, everything was cooked and served tableside to perfection.  A glass of the Lawry's house Merlot and one of Cabernet topped off the meal.  No dessert this trip.",

The prime rib was very tasty, but I felt smaller than my Lawry's cut in Los Angeles. The restaurant itself was unimpressive compared to the extremely Classy Los Angeles one.  Our waitress was rather mediocre, the LA waitress was so into her job, taking pride in representing Lawry's. Getting back to the size issue, I think if you name a cut after the restaurant, its gotta be so massive that one can't even finish it, I'm just saying. But the taste was there, no problem there.",

But I absolutely loved loved loved their lobster tail. The sides are also pretty good.  They made special menus for my birthday as well as little seasoning shakers for party favors.  I thought it was a nice touch.    Everyone at the party enjoyed themselves.  The service was excellent.  They also have a great selection of wines and cocktail drinks. (Sigh, when some of my friends realized it was an open bar, they HAD to order the most expensive glass of wine. oh my, i still can't forget when I saw the bill) Anyway, I really liked this place.  I've tired their other locations in Beverly Hills and their sister restaurants in the OC, and I'd have to say the one in Las Vegas is the best.  Yes, its a little pricey but its worth it for special occasions that you want to remember.",

A great for dates, special occasions, or just any day of the week place.   Spin salad before the meal was tasty and fun to watch before you start your meal. We order the most popular cut the \"Lawry's cut\" which is great portion for you appetite if you want to enjoy and not over eat yourself. It also came with their delicious cream corn, mash and famous Yorkshire pudding bread.   Didn't try their dessert because I'm not a dessert type of person but I'm sure it's should also be pretty good too.   Looking forward to my next visit to Lawry's next month for my own birthday",

Made a reservation that evening for a 9:30pm reservation. So being from San Francisco I got the impression that this is equivalent to our \"House of Prime Rib\" in SF.  Our meal started off with warm sourdough bread followed by the spinning salad.  Next came the cart with the prim rib and it was sliced right in front of us.  For our sides we had the garlic mashed potatoes and the creamed corn.  The beef it self was good but not as good as the House of Prim Rib.  I'm not sure if the beef was dry aged but it just lacked robust flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it was still really good but I had higher expectations for it I guess.",

I seriously told her to just give us 5 minutes to look things over... calm down lady seriously.  I got the feeling as soon as we entered that this place was hoity toity ritzy ditzy pish posh heaven, because we weren't dressed up (i was wearing black slacks and a black t-shirt) we seemed out of place and it instantly seemed to our waitress that since we didn't want drinks we must not be good tippers... well let me tell you something, she definitely got what she deserved... she's lucky she got anything at all based on how unwelcome I felt there.  I have never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant before.. when the cart came over for us to get our prime rib it was extremely cold and looked like it had been sitting there for about 2 days... the meat was tough and tasteless and so was the gravy for the potatoes and the ju sauce...   I will never return to this place for fear of how my other friends might be treated  the sad part is I went out to celebrate my father's birthday who passed 6 years ago... the last thing he ever wanted to eat was prime rib, and it was sad that I had to experience such terrible service during such a somber moment for myself.  go here if you fly your own plane or like to be treated like a second class citizen when you don't wear button up t-shirts and sweat money... they can keep their carts of flavorless meat... absolutely terrible experience... I don't even know why I'm giving two stars... Oh ... yeah... Okay... here's why.  1 star to the bartender because he was very nice and the Stella tasted very fresh.  1 star cause my water was full all the time and I didn't need to ask for any refills.",

It's not the most romantic of places, I know, but we didn't want to spend the $150 per person (or more) that all the well-rated fancy restaurants on the Strip seem determined to charge.  We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.  Lawry's is an old-fashioned sort of place.  It's not gourmet, but honest-to-goodness good food.  The service was gracious, although slow.  Seating was very comfortable.  Food was great, but we think House of Prime Rib in San Francisco still reigns supreme for this sort of dining.   The only disappointing dish of the evening was dessert (Coconut Banana Cream Pie--skip it).  The price was right; we walked out for about $150 total.  This is one of the few meals we've had in Las Vegas where we actually felt like we got our money's worth!",

    "text": "We have been going to this Lawry's for 18 years. Over the last 8 years or  so the quality of the food is nowhere near what it used to be. The chef's change often, the preparation of some menu items change also. We have been told this by at least 3 different servers. My husband always orders the Bone-in Ribeye Steak. Usually THE best Ribeye you will find anywhere. Like I mentioned chef's change, menu changes. On our last visit my husband ordered the Bone-in Ribeye steak. It literally was a sliced piece of cooked prime rib put on the grill and served with no usual sauce. We know that Ribeye/prime rib is the same. But when you order a Ribeye steak you expect a raw piece of meat cooked on the grill, not a slice of cooked prime rib put on the grill. The texture and taste was prime rib not steak, it was awful. For the 16 years that my husband has been ordering it, it never came prepared this way. For $64!!!, so not worth it.  We haven't been here in 2 years because our last visit wasn't all that great either. We only came because guests we brought here years ago really wanted to come back, despite our warnings. They were surprised that they both ordered the Lawry's cut, and they were given very different sizes of meat!! Service wasn't all that great either. Really sad, this was one of our favorite restaurants.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of the Lawry's tradition. The prime rib is great and service is usually consistent as well. This is your classic steakhouse with all the reliable rituals: juicy slabs of beef, au jus, yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, baked potato, etc. You can't go wrong with much of anything on the menu. All satisfying and delicious. Their creamed spinach is especially addicting. Dining at Lawry's is a complete experience. The decor and uniforms, the rolling cart of beef, your carver's medallion, the presentation of the spinning salad are all assembled and choreographed for a reason. They've been doing this for 75 years and are preserving history and tradition.  Disappointments: I want to give 5 stars, but the last few times we visited, I have seen more patrons dressed in sweats, dumpy t-shirts and raggedy jeans. I felt like I was eating at a food court or cafeteria. Eating here is not cheap and there's that whole classic/custom/tradition thing. You don't have to be in formal wear, but at least try something that is laundered. And sometimes the staff at the hostess stand seem more flighty and disorganized than necessary.  Otherwise, mmm, beeef.",

Our hostess Mrs. Fraley was an absolute  doll and took very good care of us. The whole donning experience was more interactive than a typical steakhouse which I loved.  The carver brought the prime  rib cart to our table and we watched as he played our meal. Im sure everything on their menu is delicious... but order the prime rib! You will not be disappointed.  The spinnung salad was a perfect started to our meal! Bu the BEST part about dinner was that the food was seasoned beautifully. We ordered the mushrooms and asparagus for sides which were full of flavor! I opted for the California cut of prime rib which was perfect portion for me! I was totally  full but did not feel uncomfortable full. My boyfriend choose the Lawrys cut and felt like a king.  There was not a single lump in our mashed potatoes and the gravy... ahhh the gravy.  Delectable. Our carver even came back to check on us! We went to celebrate my boyfriend's  birthday and I'm pretty  sure I got the Best-Girlfriend-Ever-Award for surprising him with this amazing meal. He even got a free apple cake for this birthday.  Our total check was $135.13 which included two prime rib dinners, the extra 2 veggie sides, 1 beer, and 1 cocktail. If you ask me this meal was priceless. Probably one of the top 3 meals I've ever had.",

If not the best, then this place serves one of the best prime rib dinners.  Excellent, melts in your mouth.  The way they serve it-- by cutting it at your table to your liking-- is fabulous.  The decor is art deco.  It feels dark, cozy and like I am transported back to the days of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.  Fine with me!  Staff is polite and super friendly.    Besides the prime rib-- their creamed spinach and horseradish/whipped cream sauce are to die for!  And how many places serve Yorkshire Pudding, which pairs so darned well with the prime rib!?!?!  We love the spectacle of serving the beef tableside... plus the salad!  It is also brought to table side in a shining silver cart, where your wait person spins the dressing onto the greens.  It is an \"old fashioned\" 60's style salad of beets, hard cooked eggs, romaine, etc.-- I LOVE IT!  Who has any clue what their desserts are like?  I am always so stuffed full after my meal, that I have no interest in dessert.  However, I do love their coffee, served in a silver pot, and maybe an after dinner brandy to go with it.  There is a parking lot in front, but not too far from the Strip walking-wise.  It is a wonderful change of pace from the typical Vegas schmaltzy Buffet dinner, and totally worth the price.   I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "The first thing that attracts me to Lawry's is the fact that it is located off The Strip.  It is close enough that you can still enjoy but far enough away to avoid the manics.  Another thing to take note is that if you're a turf fan, you will love Lawry's.  If you're more to the surf, well your choices are limited to a couple different types of seafood (lobster and fish of the day) and perhaps a couple of different appetizers.  It is called \"The Prime Rib\" after all and not the \"Chicken of the Sea\".  Me, being a red meat carnivore, I've always gone with the beef.  The meat choices are a bit limited too but the choices that they have, they cook to perfection.  When I've dined here, I usually went with the rib-eye with a cabernet sauce and served with au gratin potatoes and crispy fried onions on top.  Perhaps not the best steak I've ever but IMO, it ranks right up there.  The start of every meal begins with their spinning salad.  Of course, it is a bit of a show but isn't that what Vegas is all about?  Ok, they do that at all Lawry's so I can't blame Vegas for that.  So basically the salad is prepared at your table, spun over a bowl of ice to get the salad chilled, tossed with the dressing and served.  I like the fact that it cools the salad down nicely because no one wants a warm salad.  The salad is presented on a chilled plate and a cold fork is provided.  Me, not being a beet lover didn't realize that was included in the salad and I really wasn't a fan.  I learned my lesson for subsequent visits.  A MUST is to order a side dish of their mushrooms to go with your steak.  A variety of mushrooms sauteed in garlic butter and fresh herbs.  That could be a meal in itself however joining the flavor of the mushrooms with a bite of steak is out of this world.  No meal would be complete without the cheesecake.  Their cheesecake is served with fresh berries and a raspberry liqueur sauce  .Honestly, there really is nothing special about Lawry's cheesecake but it's a nice way to get that sweet tooth craving taken care of after eating salt throughout my meal.    While the wine selection isn't massive, they do offer a decent selection from whites to reds so chances are you will be able to find something to your liking.  The decor of the restaurant leans towards the upscale side of the scale however there isn't that pretentious feel as you walk through the doors.  The dress is business casual but I've seen anything from VERY casual to formal walking through the doors.  Either way, they make you feel at home, regardless of your attire.  The service is what you'd expect......excellent!!  You will continuously experience someone stopping by your table to see if there is anything you need, refilling your glass or folding your napkin as you excuse yourself to the restroom.  Sometimes I just like to make several trips to the restroom to see how many times they will refold my napkin.  Ok, I haven't done that, but I've thought of it.  Point being, service is out of this world and there is the appearance that they actually enjoy you being there and that they are not just doing their job.   With all that said, Lawry's is on the pricey side.  $85-100 per person is not to be unexpected including meal, drinks and gratuity.  Nope, not a frequent visitor of Lawry's, but when I have visited, they've always delivered without cutting any corners.   For a treat, it's a place you can't go wrong.",

When a restaurant rests its reputation on one particular dish, prime rib in this case, and it isn't consistent, it's not worth the chance. I had a poor cut of the prime rib. They actually had a tough time cutting it from the main piece. It took TWO \"carvers\" to do it. When I advised the waitress ( who btw was pleasant and not  to blame) the manager had no interest in addressing the issue. That was the SADDEST part of the experience, that they were NOT concerned for a customer's satisfaction!!!! However, they did offer a FREE desert to make up for an unpleasant $50 piece of meat so i  guess that was supposed to make me happy. I refused the desert and left dissatisfied.  We will no longer include this restaurant on our list of places to patronize when in Vegas. With all the available places to dine in Vegas, you can certainly spend your money more wisely than here.",

    "text": "Had Thanksgiving dinner there with nine friends.  Have to say,  we were very disappointed.   Half the table had traditional turkey dinner,  the other half had the prime rib.   The portions were very small.  We ordered family style spinach and corn for the table,   They brought us two of each.   There was enough for one spoonful for each person.   They charged us for 4 family servings, which makes me think they might have intended to bring 4...but never did.  There was not enough bread for the entire table and the Yorkshire puddingwas cut clumsily to serve 9 very small pieces.   No au juice was offered or served.  One of my guests asked for medium rare and was served medium well. This has been a family favorite for special occasions in the past,  but will be eliminated for future holiday get togethers.  Sorry Lawyrys,  this visit was a prime disappointment.  William Ladner",

    "text": "Pro's:  Great Prime Rib Incredible hospitality and service Beautiful Decor  Con's: Expensive Side Dishes not my favorite  I had a wedding reception dinner here with an open bar tab.  Just about everyone ordered the Prime Rib and it was great.  The carts that they server off of are very fancy.  The side dishes of creamed corn and Yorkshire puddings were sub-par.  The place took care of all of the arrangements and from the meal to getting people cabs back to the strip hotels, it was all top notch.    I have been to the Lawry's in Los Angeles and it is a bit better, but our meal was very good.    With the open bar tab the meal with tip cost about an average of 80-100 bucks a person so it isn't cheap, but well worth it.    If you have a function and need a place to book, try this place.    Thanks",

Service is on-point. Bread baskets, spinning bowl salad (with the best croutons) and shrimp cocktail are great starters. Table-side carving of prime rib and sides are always perfect. I get the California or English cut, smaller cuts but still enough for me to bring home leftovers.   Only complaint is that after coming here year-after-year for a decade, we've watched the prices creep up to vegas strip-status. When prices are resort-level highs, you lose some of the authenticity which I hate seeing with Lawry's.",

Ordered the Beef Bowl cut prime rib for dinner (medium rare ofcourse), which included mash potatoes, au jus, horseradish, yorkshire pudding and bread. Asked for extra aujus.  Food came on time and was hot. Food also came in a cloth bag, kind of like what you might get from Whole Foods.  The fam will be using it for grocery shopping.    The prime rib is as I remembered it, tender all the way through.  In my opinion, one of the better prime ribs (I've had many others from upper toered steak houses). My girl actually enjoyed and she is VERY picky.    They gave me a tub of au jus, thanks! This is the first time i tried their horseradish and man did it clear up any sinus issues i had previously.  Not a bread kind of guy but ate up all the break and yorkshire by dipping into the au Jus.   Overall, the greatest compliment I can give a dish is that I recommend it to others and will come back.",

By the way, having prime rib for leftovers, not as glorious as when it's sliced fresh, but still so full of flavor.  Your dish will be accompanied with a not so fancy spinning salad, it was just fancy presentation.   We did Finish off with a cup of espresso and split three ways of there recommended coconut banana creme pie.    Yup not enough space in any of our combined 3 bellies because we couldn't even finish the pie.  We maxed out our capacity with that prime rib. Lol!

I didn't mind that old school feel,plus there was Sinatra playing in the speakers. Kinda nice. Classy place, but not too spiffy if you were to wear jeans. I got the roasted turkey dinner with creamed corn. Thanksgiving on a plate! My co-workers got a pastrami sandwich and the prime rib and they all said it was excellent. Highly recommend for friends and family coming from out of town or if your local to definitely come in for lunch.",

The bread they started off with was perfect and we got creamed corn and asparagus as appetizers. The creamed corn was very good and very rich. The appetizers were amazingly fresh and buttery. For an entree I got the  the \"Beef Bowl Cut\" of prime rib which is their largest cut. If they would have had a larger size I would have gotten that. The beef is cut right in front of you and the meat is so juicy and succulent it's making me hungry thinking about it. The beef is perfectly seasoned and melts in your mouth. You almost don't have to chew it. I loved this place.",

The prime rib was good, it wasn't bad at all, but really not as good as the one we've got in Chicago. And there are really too many steakhouses in Las Vegas, so we feel that we don't have to go to Lawry's. This Lawry's is good though, not bad, but not a must spot when we are in vegas. But I do recommend you to try Lawry's in general, so if you don't get to try the one in Chicago, try the one in las vegas, shouldn't be disappointed.",

The wait staff takes your drink order.  When you are ready to order, you go to the carving station where he creates your meal.   The sandwich comes with au jus and sandwich topping from the toppings bar.  It has coleslaw, fruit, lettuce, tomatoes, onions etc.   The prime rib dinners are the same size as the evening meal but served w/o the spinned salad.  They come with two sides.  They are just less expensive.  I love this place for lunch and dinner.  They define what prime rib should be.  I almost forgot, they also offer turkey and pastrami at lunch. It looked great but I always default to the prime rib.   I wish they were open on weekends for lunch.  I would be there for sure.",

And that is that the experience is good, and the food good, but, it never seems to be great.  It satisfies my meat cravings, but, only just barely and for years now, I've been waiting to be impressed.  Nice restaurant decor and overall good service.  Always love the creamed corn.  Salad was pretty good this time (not too much dressing as they often do).    Yorkshire pudding just passes, carver's carving technique (look of the cut) very mediocre.  My piece was somewhat veiny and smaller than I'd remembered.  And, I know this is just a fact and its always been the case, but, I'm still going to complain about the fact that not being able to swap out mashed potatoes for baked kind of bugs me, even though I know everything is supposedly ala carte.  In that case, I'd rather do without the mashed all together, which I don't care for much anyway.    Bottom line, I'll continue to go at the suggestions of others, but, really not a place I'd have much to rave about.",

The service could not be more impeccable, and when I say impeccable, I'm talking proper ladies dressed oh-so-properly in aprons, who refer to themselves as Mrs. So and So.  It all made me feel a bit like a naughty schoolgirl.  But I digress.... What brought us there, of course, was the meat.  I've dined at Lawry's in LA, and well, a huge, rare cut of prime rib just sounded good, so away we went, to carnivore heaven.  Perfect as always, from the extra-dry martini, to the spinning salad with amazing house dressing, to the always-perfect prime rib, carved table-side.  I, for a fairly small girl, can pretty much consume my weight in rare beef, so I was pretty damn content.  Yorkshire pudding, done just right added the perfect touch.   All in all, a great meal, served perfectly, which is what one would expect from Lawry's The Prime Rib. A lovely plus?  Not a child in sight!  I'm sure it happens, but thankfully, not while we were there! Dessert?  Well, that was later, at another location, but I'm quite sure they do dessert as well as they do everything else. Highly recommended for a great, hearty, well-served dinner in lovely, comfortable yet somehow manly (in the best possible way) surroundings.",

She was brisk, not too friendly and got our orders promptly.    I ordered the Prime Rib Dinner and was a bit disappointed.  The rib was tender however, was a bit flavorless.  Perhaps, I'm not a big rib fan to begin with, but it just didn't hit the spot. Portions were very large and had to grab the rest to go.  The mashed potatoes were sub-par.   Pros: - Great portions.  Cons:  - Sub-par service. - Expect a wait even with reservations.",

The consistency is surprising for a Vegas joint.    If you haven't been here, go.  Now.  It beats anything on the strip (including any and all buffets, which IMHO don't even come close).  And when you go to Lawry's, don't ask for chicken, don't ask for fish.  You're here for a reason: prime rib.    The meat is just so succulent, tender and juicy that it's a straight up crime if you haven't experienced prime rib this good (or better...I do agree that the pomp and circumstance at House of Prime Rib raises the bar a notch).  I love that you can cut through your meat with a fork.  Like butta, baby.    I am, however, anal retentive/obsessive compulsive and hate food mixing on my plate, so my only wish for Lawry's is to have all the sides served on a separate plate or bowl.  When you're eating food this well prepared, that's a trivial gripe.",

It's fun to have your meat carved in front of your table and to watch them make the spinning salad. The lobster was normal, nothing was spectacular.   My honest review is 2 stars but I'll give 2 extra to our delightful server.  What I did enjoy was the whole dining experience and our server was a crack up. She was so entertaining. I would go back just for her.  It was my first time, and she said she was happy to pop my cherry, the gay's loved that.  Then she took our order, I told her I'd wait to see what everyone's cut was and then I'd like to go last. She then said, \"So I'll do everyone first and then I'll do you last.\"  My gay friends got a kick out of that too. Then she asked my friends if they wanted a refill on their cokes? When they said no, she replied, \" okay, so you're all coked out huh?\" Oh the gays loved that one also. I would divulge more but I'm afraid the management will read this review. Let's just say, we had a very nice time at this wonderful establishment.  4 stars.",

My friends really liked the prime rib, and enjoyed it thoroughly, but the person paying for the meal thought it was overpriced compared to \"The Loft Prime Rib\" with comparable quality of meat and preparation.  For my part, the selected veggies were poor:  * Asparagus were thick, tough, and old, lacking the kind of springy, freshness you find outside of Las Vegas  * Even compared to other Las Vegas asparagus, this was the worst I had in the last week.  * Lettuce in Las Vegas suffers the same way at almost all places of dining, fine or otherwise. Lettuce is limp, as are some veggies in the salad.  Pluses:  * The salad dressing was tasty  * The preparation of the cooked veggies was good (even if the raw ingredients of veggies and their condition to start with was not.)  * My friends liked the meat, the marbling, flavor, and portions",

    "text": "I am not that big of a Prime Rib fan.   I guess I don't understand why Americans in droves are so enamored over a large slab of tasteless beef that costs $30? I have had my share through the years, but I prefer a Filet Mignon, Porterhouse, or NY Pepper steak instead. I think the best part of Prime Rib is the Horse Raddish!  But Lawry's can make most people a fan, because they do it well. They employ the large metal table-side carts, just like House of Prime Rib does on Van Ness in The City.   They have at least 5 different sized cuts, from small, sliced, medium, large, and super-large in-bone. The most popular is the Lawry's Cut. This is $37, but comes with their tasty, chilled Lawry's Salad, mash potatoes, and bread pudding. You can order optional sides of cream spinach ( I recommend it, it is good) or corn. You are served warmed sourdough -like bread before the meal.  We started in the bar, having 5 of us after a trade show cooling down over cocktails, and talking shop. They have great crunchy potato chips in the bar. You are seated by a hostess when your table is ready, served by a waitress, and a separate chef carves up your meat and plates it for you, table-side  4 of us ordered the Lawry's Cut with a side of creamed spinach. The fifth order the one increment larger Jim Brady Cut. It is a lot of food, especially after we started with 2 plates of calamari appetizers to split, which came with a tasty Chipotle spiced Aoili dip.   The service is great, the food is very good, and the ambiance is nice and relaxed.   Lawry's on Flamingo in the Hughes Center between Paradise and Las Vegas Blvd (the strip).  PS - with the Lawry's seasoning and only USDA Prime cuts, this is good Prime Rib. But my favorite part was still the Horse Raddish!",

    "text": "4 Star food... 5 Star experience  Lawry's is a great middle ground steakhouse (okay, more so prime rib) restaurant for those who want better than the neighborhood Outback but would rather not drop Alexander's-esque money.  In my opinion, the prime rib at Lawry's is in the company of Ruth's Chris and Morton's, all the while being a touch gentler on the pocket book...  The decor is fancy and refined enough to be impressive and date-worthy; valet parking, leather couches  and a stone fireplace adorn the lobby/reception, dim lighting, a mellow bar, a spacious dining room.  All the while, this location in particular [Vegas], also seems open to the casual \"propriety be d@mned\" customer base probably isn't uncommon for this town...  Service on this night was excellent!  Our server, Ms. Hughes, was fast, attentive, and personable; checking on us throughout the night, taking the ladies' orders first (a nice touch!), serving the ladies first, suggesting accompaniments, pouring our wines... She was matron-like in her charm and attention...  Part of the allure here is the spectacle/show they make of service.  Order wine?  The server pours it for you in with a flamboyant move, cascading a stream of wine from some height into a swirling glass.  The salad course, which is included in the price of any size prime rib entree, is prepared table-side; the server rapidly spins a stainless steel bowl in a large vessel of ice, adding condiments and dressing, gingerly mixing the salad within until the bowl comes to a halt.    And then there's the prime rib. Like House of Prime Rib, anticipation of when one of those big chrome carts of prime rib will finally tend to your table helps build your hunger and makes the experience fun.  The cart arrives, the carver wields his blade, and the server asks you \"what type of cut and what temperature would you like that?\"...its on...!  Now for the price of the prime rib dinner, ranging from $31 for the California Cut, to $34 for the Lawry Cut, to $40(?) for some \"this is ridiculous, who can eat all this?\" cut... the price also includes the spinning salad, 2 choices of a number of sides, and Yorkshire pudding...  So, if you've already broken the bank on craziness on the strip... Lawry's is a nice escape just a couple blocks off the strip...",

Not only do I think Lawry's has the best Prime Rib I've ever had but I think the way the restaurant is ran, it's one of the best overall restaurant experiences.  The Prime Rib sits in a cart that is brought to your table and sliced individually.  The waitress was extremely polite and impressive.  I can't afford to eat here often but I do believe treating yourself every once in a while is required.  Make reservations early.  We didn't get to go the night we initially wanted due to the popularity.",

We all decided that we wanted at least one nice dinner while we were down here and a friend told us that Lawry's was the place to go. There were about 30 of us so we got our own private room and two awesome servers, both named Ms. Brown.  For about $50 you get the dinner that consists of prime rib, mashed potatoes, and a side of vegetables. The prime rib was tender and delicious and is carved right in front of you. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were good, but I was unable to finish it all. I was thinking about getting a side of asparagus, but since I couldn't finish everything I am glad I didn't.   I would highly recommend that you try this place when you come down to Vegas.  Zipzap Zubidy Bop!",

The service was impeccable and the ambience was typical of a fancy steak house (although I couldn't decide if the still-in-the-60s uniforms were cool or tired).  The shrimp cocktail was delicious and the prime rib was pretty good, but that's where it ended.  Their \"famous\" salad was very disappointing; it had absolutely zero flavor (except the croutons were delicious) and the stems weren't removed from the spinach (tacky).  The meal comes with mashed potatoes and gravy, which were very salty and heavy and the Yorkshire pudding was an out of place addition.  It wasn't the worst place we've ever eaten, but could use some re-evaluating.",

The host at the front desk seemed to be helping a new employee get comfortable and acquainted with all the tricks of the trade. A hostess led us to our table and pulled the table out so we could get into the booth comfortably. It's the little things. Our waiter introduced himself and brought us our drinks.  The dinner started with their popular spinning salad bowl. He recommended the house seasoned pepper on our table, which we loved. Then the prime rib cart rolled up to our table.  After serving all of us, depending on our requested cuts, they brought out two kinds of horseradish and Yorkshire pudding. The pudding is an egg bread primarily good for soaking up the au jus on the plate. Delicious! Finally dessert and coffee to round out a perfect meal in an ambience of friendly refinement.  Special thank you to Mr.Ball, our waiter, who kept the drinks constantly filled and was the picture of professionalism and deft. Looking forward to visiting again soon!",

Its old school, where your server is called Mr. or Miss (last name), and when you are seated at the booth, they literally pull out the booth so you don't have to slide in... that's classy!  The server greets you with a smile, and  starts you off with warm sourdough bread, then prepares the famous \"spinning bowl\" salad tableside.  You are given a cold fork to eat your salad.  The famous prime rib is carved right at your table, and you get precisely the type of wellness you want in your meat.    All meals comes with the salad, and the meat comes with whipped potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, and horseradish sauces (creamed and grated).  Side vegetables are extra, but so yummy!  We took advantage of the Travelzoo offer which was - Salad - California cut of prime rib (6 oz) plus a petite lobster tail (2 oz) - Dessert - Coffee or tea for $49 a person, but we added a side of creamed corn each, so the bill came to $240 with tax/ tip.  The best parf of this visit was the Christmas Carolers were going from table to table singing carols.  The carolers sang 2 German Christmas tunes, and 1 caroler sat down next to Stephen's mom and they sang a mini duet.  Lawry's isn't cheap, but its not meant to me. You pay for the experience of being served.  From the time you sit down, you don't have to move except to eat.",

    "text": "Lawry's is a specific dining destination, and not necessarily for everyone. If you love prime rib and want to be pampered by stellar service in an old school setting, do check it out. It helps to be on an expense account, or have someone else pick up the tab if you're not among the 1%. This is one swank, fancy place with prices to match.  Start off your evening in the spacious bar, nicely appointed with comfortable leather stools. Don't get too fancy with the cocktails. Simply order up a Hendrick's martini. I enjoyed mine with a slice of cucumber, per the bartender's recommendation, while others might opt for the horseradish and prime rib stuffed olives. The seasoned potato chips served gratis with drinks are light, crispy, and very tasty. Plus, they're gluten free! Anyone with food allergies will be attended to with great care. Lawry's takes their customer service very seriously.  Keep dinner simple too. A salad, a slab of prime rib, and the creme brulee for dessert. Since I'm not a big fan of prime rib, I opted for one of their lobster tails. It was fine, but didn't bowl me over with joy. If I had been paying for the meal, I would have been disappointed. Luckily, I was on a business trip with more senior colleagues footing the bill.   The best thing about Lawry's - for me - is their impeccable service. From the moment you enter, it seems their goal is customer satisfaction. If you don't like something, take it back. They'll happily work with you to find something to make you smile. For me, it was a pumpkin-flavored dessert martini at the end of the meal. Seasonal and delicious.",

    "text": "After 4 years and saying I wouldn't go back to Lawry's my wife was craving prime rib. She wanted a nice night out for just the two of us and I thought why not give Lawry's a second try? I regret my decision, and I assure everyone reading this that I won't be going back.   I can understand the appeal of the place. It's different. Once you step foot in the main dining room it's like stepping back in time a bit. The art deco decor and ambience of the place is definitely unlike anything else I've experienced in a very long time. But once you are seated and the process of ordering your food begins...things go off the rails a bit.   First off, I'm not a fan of the salad. Sure the spinning salad prepared tableside is interesting to watch, but when you pick up your fork and taste it...my wife and I looked at each other and we're like blah, and we pushed it away. Next up was the appetizers. Their shrimp cocktail looked amazing with the oversized shrimp but it is way overpriced for the 4 shrimp you get.   But you don't come here for the salad and appetizers, you come here for their prime rib. And this 5th generation Missouri cattleman who has enjoyed a lot of good prime rib was left underwhelmed by it. Sure the carts that bring it out are cool looking, having it carved tableside is a nice touch, but when you take your first bite...it's just meh. It's cooked correctly, I'll give them that, but at the same time I've had much better prime rib elsewhere and for a whole lot less.   I skipped dessert and waited for the check to arrive. $240 later we walked out with 3 boxes of food and a feeling that it just wasn't all that it's hyped up to be. We ended up giving our leftover prime rib to our dogs who were happy to take care of it. I hope considering what we paid for it that they got more enjoyment from it than my wife and I did.   As I am writing this I see on my Facebook feed that some of my friends were there tonight and enjoyed their experience. I see lots of great Yelp reviews from people I trust and respect for their spot on reviews that rarely steer me towards bad choices. But again...I'm just not impressed. I thought Lawry's was disappointing back in 2012, and 4 years later I find myself thinking the same thing again. With the myriad choices of places to eat in Vegas at this price point, I won't be coming back.   1 Star. If my wife's not happy, I'm not happy. And if we both walked out thinking it sucks, that's the end of any hope of raising the star count. Oh and when one makes reservations, keeping people waiting another 20 minutes while your front staff can't figure out what the heck they're doing doesn't help your cause either. And the valet service is clueless and rude. I ended up parking myself after being ignored...the valet staff was too busy staring at the women getting out of the Maserati in front of us to even bother giving us the time of day.",

After awhile I was used to the menu and the staff.  The prime rib is OK...I prefer my rib well done, not 'raw'.  They over cooked it the first time.  So,  the next few times I went, I just got a doggie bag and finished cooking it at home.  The rolls, salad, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were good.",

I made reservations on open table literally 20 minutes prior to my reservation and had no problem getting in.   Once greeted by the friendly staff we were escorted to a nice roomy corner booth with a view of the entire main dinning area. Our waitress has worked here for 11 years was friendly and funny. She took my drink order while we enjoyed the complimentary warm yummy bread. I placed an order of wild mushroom medley so the timing would coincide while Arturo carved  my request of the Lawry's bone in prime rib cut and plated my mixed cream corn &  spinach, mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. The prime rib was delish, tender and flavorful - it was that moment I realized why I unconsciously wanted to dine here!  All the sides were perfect and the wild mushrooms were incredible. Unfortunately I was so full I  had to pass on dessert, so decided to walk over to Starbucks and had a nightcap Frappuccino.  I'll definitely return to Lawry's again for the traditional food, service and convenience.",

I was so excited for the prime rib, but I was a little disappointed. Maybe it's because we went real late and the food didn't taste fresh and hot, well the prime rib at least. Sides were good nothing too extravagant. The cut of the prime rib was great but it wasn't hot and it didn't taste fresh. It got cold real fast.   Service was ok. Felt like server couldn't wait to go home felt kinda rushed. We got the surf and turf lobster tails.   I would like to try this place again maybe early dinner when everything is fresh.   Great touch by adding complementary dessert for our anniversary.",

    "text": "Hands down the best prime rib I've ever had! Came here for my birthday last weekend and it was my 1st time at a Lawry's. I had heard so much about their prime rib, so as a prime rib lover I couldn't wait to check it out! We made reservations in advance but I'm not sure if it is necessary because the restaurant didn't appear full, even on a Saturday night.   Once you are seated you are presented with a dinner menu and wine list. Once we selected our bottle of wine - Lawry's private selection Chardonnay, our waiter explained the menu and ordering process to us since it was our 1st time at Lawry's. After this, for some strange reason our menus were taken away. If you would like to add a lobster tail to your meal or any sides besides creamed corn and creamed spinach, this is when you have to place those orders.  The prime rib is brought around on carts and sliced at your table. You are asked for the cut size you'd like, along with how cooked you like it. In my opinion, for prime rib you definitely have to go medium rare. I went with the Lawry Cut which is around 10 oz. All prime rib dinners include mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, which is a puffed bread and not an actual pudding as I had thought lol.   You have the option of adding a scoop of creamed corn or creamed spinach, which were good but definitely not worth the ridiculous 7 bucks per scoop price! Now we know. Other sides come on small plates and we opted for some mushrooms which were $9. The meat was perfectly seasoned and very juicy. Usually when you have prime rib, some areas are more seasoned or dry than others...that was certainly not the case here and even the parts without fat were juicy and flavorful.  At the end of the meal, our plates were taken away and a buser came by to de-crumb our table - fancy!. This is when we were handed dessert menus. Too full to order anything and about to depart for my UYE party, I was about to decline dessert when they brought out a small cupcake sized shortcake with a single candle on top. This was a nice surprise to close out our wonderful meal.   I will definitely be back and can't wait until next time! Before leaving the restaurant, I was already thinking when my next visit would be!",

The prime rib is absolutely the best, so tender and flavorful. The service is top notch with attention to detail.  I especially was impressed with how our waitress Ms Olmos handled my gluten sensitivity issues. She brought me a gluten free gravy and had the kitchen prepare a gf version of green beans since I couldn't eat the creamed corn or spinach.  We took advantage of the prime rib special for two and we were very pleased.",

Not a problem as there were seats in the bar where Lawry's for sure makes a great cocktail!    We were soon seated for dinner and that's when it took a bit of a turn. We waited for quite a while before we were acknowledged by our server (I will keep HIS name out of this). I had no problem with our server being a male, I just don't think this is the place for him. He just didn't have the charm that the rest of the Lawry's staff has always had. We overheard people asking other staff members what was going on with \"our\" server. No one seemed happy with him.   Food was pretty good but not fantastic like it used to be.  Of course our servers lack of attention for long periods of time could have played a role in my opinion of the food.   All in all, Lawry's is a fun experience. I will return I just know to ask for one of their charming servers who has been working there for many years.",

Take a well needed break, and make a reservation at Lawry's.  This restaurant takes the holiday season seriously.  For the moment you step through the door and feel the warmth of the fireplace in the foyer, or sip your first pomegranate mule at the bar, you will feel it in the air...the holidays are here!  Embrace the feeling of holiday joy as you are escorted to your table.  Your eyes will focus on the beautifully decorated dining room.  Elegant Christmas trees decorate the tops of the soft comfy red velvet dining booths throughout the perimeter of the room.  Never pretentious, the staff makes everyone feel at home.  They are proud to be apart of this family business.  As they share the history of the restaurant with you, while greeting you at your table & spinning your salad, table side. They really do care! If cocktails are making your memory fuzzy, the staff will leave you a printed version of the family legacy.  The warmly lite holiday-themed dining room welcomes you to enjoy a relaxed festive evening.  As appetizers roll out and more holiday themed cocktails fill the table, you'll begin to feel that you made the made the right choice tonight,  to dine here.  For a half a century, dinner has been the same.  You know what to expect, spinning salad,  prime rib done right, house-made au jus, Yorkshire pudding & scratch mash potatoes smothered in homemade gravy.  Food that comforts you, in an elegant setting.  The highlight of the evening was the Christmas caroling quartet that faintly echoed throughout the room.  Stopping at each table to sing 3 Christmas melodies of your choice to each guest table.  This was the icing on the cake.  A hot rum tody or cognac to round up the evening should send you on your way to a perfect ending.  I wouldn't have been surprised if I found a basket of warm blankets by the front door to enjoy along with after dinner drinks by the fireplace under the holiday lights.    Or our Uber replaced by even a reindeer or two outside the door to whisk us away by sleigh.  For those holiday travelers who long to return to the 19th century and the days of Charles Dickens, the Lawry's Prime Rib house is offering the adaptation of \"A Christmas Carol\" along with a fun family style Dickens' traditional holiday feast.  This \"Holiday Feast with Charles Dickens' \" affair will run from Dec 16-20th.  It will be held in the restaurants private dining room.   Reservations are recommended and seating is limited.  Dinner is served at 6 p.m. with the performance following the meal.   If you need a nudge to start ringing in the holiday season, dining here is the perfect beginning.",

The waitresses are dressed in this old-school nurse outfit and toss your salads right in front of your table (and no, not your urban dictionary salad; I realized what I just wrote). Their whole routine is pretty cool.   We checked out Lawry's as part of our friend's bachelor's party weekend. Their parking lots are spacious. Love their whole interior decor, the staff's costume, and comfortable seating. The professional prime rib carvers would bring out their cart with the enormous block of prime ribs and carve in front of you.   I got their Prime Rib, Lawry Cut ($47), medium rare, since I figured, it's what they are known for. It was delicious and tender. My friends ordered this and their ribeye, which is also fantastic.  I would definitely come back again and recommend this place for their prime ribs and the experience as a whole.",

    "text": "FINALLY got to try Lawry's and it does live up to its hype! An excellent place to have dinner for any special occasion or any night to be honest. If I had a Lawry's down the street, I'd have prime rib every week.   I ordered the California Cut ($42) medium rare, creamed corn (my favorite side, it was sooo good!), creamed spinach (it was okay), mashed potatoes (same) and a glass of house cabernet sauvignon. The prime rib can't be beat, it's carved at the table - hot, juicy and tender. Melt in your mouth perfection! Prime rib covered in au jus with creamy horseradish, lord have mercy I'm already getting hungry writing this review.   Lawry's screams classic fine dining from the second you enter from the decor to the tables. The atmosphere is interesting 1930's and the waitresses even wear 1950's outfits.   I recommend this place to all the prime rib lovers and foodies. I usually almost never finish my food, but I sure did here. It was delish! Someone please take me here for mother's day or valentine's day or any day.",

Fuck off already!  Anyway, I had the Lawry cut prime rip. It was delicious but absolutely not $50 delicious. I'd say more like $25.  For $50 I want enough meat to challenge my appetite. Finished it easily with room to spare.   Got asparagus as an extra side which came with hollandaise sauce and was - eh. The famous 'spin' salad simply was not good.  The Yorkshire pudding thing was a nice touch and very good.  The sourdough bread was very good in the middle but the outer crust dry and inedible.   Lastly, what's up with the southern plantation spin with the staff's attire?  I thought the civil war was over and that side didn't win.",

Prime rib was cut perfectly and was so tender and came with enough au jus. I took every bite with a little bit of horseradish and it was to die for! The lobster tails were extremely tender as well.   Service was excellent as always. Dining at Lawry's is truly an experience from the moment you arrive. The service is top notch without being overbearing or snotty. The presentation of the spinning salad is always fun to watch. And the best part is when the master carver brings the cart to your table and carves your cut of prime rib table side.   Yes, it's pricey, but it's so totally worth it.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue. The first time I came here was with my cousin, his girlfriend at the time and a couple friends. He raved about the prime rib here so we all decided to check this place out. I mean, prime rib is part of the name of the restaurant so it must be good right? Lawry's is well known for their seasoning so we were very excited to see what my cousin was raving about.   He picked us up and we all came down for dinner. All of us ordered the prime rib. While we waited for our meal, we admired the decor of the place and the uniforms that the servers all are wearing. Shortly after receiving our drinks, we had a show of our server preparing our salads in a spinning bowl. It was entertaining but the salad was just average.   When the prime rib finally came, we were hungry. The cuts were generous with very little fat. That's awesome and they were seasoned well. If you needed more Lawry's seasoning, there was a shaker full of it available. Meat was so tender and I understood why my cousin raves about this restaurant after a few bites.   After this meal, I fell in love with this place because you're getting a good prime rib meal at a good price. I even paid to sign up for their VIP Rewards membership lol. Customer service here was good and it's an easy spot to come to for prime rib that's not part of a hotel buffet. So far food and service has been consistent the few times I've dined here. Check them if you're in the mood for prime rib!",

    "text": "What an amazing experience! A group of 7 of us went to Lawry's to celebrate a birthday. After we were seated, we started browsing the menu and the maitre d' (I'm assuming) came up to our table and apologized for the long wait. We hadn't even felt like we were waiting long, but he had 2 complimentary appetizers brought out for us: the calamari and shrimp cocktail. The shrimp cocktail usually comes with 5 shrimp, but there were 7 for us. So nice!  It was my first time at Lawry's, but I was already so impressed. The waitress kindly explained how everything works and my eyes were FIXATED on the meat carts. Those prime ribs look sooo good. The spinning salad was very tasty with the seasoned pepper and the complimentary appetizers were also delicious. I ordered a medium rare Lawry's cut. It comes with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, but I opted for an additional side of half creamed spinach and half creamed corn.   The meat was very tender and very flavorful. I find that most prime ribs don't have enough flavor, but Lawry's was perfect. I think it was a tad too done for my liking so I'll definitely ask for a rare cut next time. The creamed corn was by far my favorite accompaniment, but the creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding were also good. We ordered a bottle of the Justin cabernet sauvignon and it paired wonderfully with the meal.  They gave us a complimentary mini red velvet bundt cake for the birthday at the end complete with a candle! It was a really nice touch.  Overall, had a really great experience and can't wait to come back!",

Felt like a very Vegas thing to happen. The food itself was very old-school but still done very well. Watching them spin the salad and cut the prime rib table side is kind of fun. Would have liked the menu to be a little more creative with some later options. Then again I don't think that is the idea here.",

Prime rib is our number one steak selection.  I love how accomadating the service is, customers first. For example, when we are seated, I love how they pull the table out for you to sit down and slide the table back in, instead of us sliding into the booth to adjust to the table. Our medium rare prime rib was super tender and flavorful, simply melts in your mouth. The Yorkshire pudding is made from the prime rib sauce and eggs, was marvelous! I ordered a side of cream corn, that was a little too thick for me. For an extra $15, can get lobster tail and it was very good! We love lawrys and will definitely be going again! Wish they had a location in Seattle!",

But bottom line the restaurant was still open and the traffic was out of our control. Hostesses have one job and it's to be friendly!!! She had an attitude during our greeting. She had an attitude when we asked her to take our birthday group picture after our dinner. She's in the wrong industry. I don't know her name but today is Thursday night June the 13th.

Prime rib, mashed potatoes...none o' that pretentious molecular gastronomy shit here! This is OLD SCHOOL FOOD.  I came here after a really stressful day, and it was PERFECT. The minute I walked in, I kinda relaxed -- like, \"Ahhh, I'm safe now; Lawry's will take care of me!\" Then I stuffed myself with wine, red meat and carbs, and everything was wonderful.

I get the English Cut, which is thin slices of the Prime Rib.  They cut it table side, as well as the \"spinning\" salad bowl is prepared table side as well.  And it comes with the Mashed Potatoes & Yorkshire Pudding.  Compared to what you'll pay on The Strip for a great dinner, this is a MUCH better deal.  Highly recommended!  The service isn't the best, but it is still pretty good.",

    "text": "The name pretty much says it all. Lawry's, THE Prime Rib.    They say that when you're in Vegas you should do it big or don't do it at all.  With that in mind, some friends and I took birthday boy out for a little finer dining before hitting up the clubs.  And what is finer to a 6 foot something, 200 lb. guy than a rolling kitchen serving up large slabs of delicious meat?  With my handy yelp app I easily and efficiently looked up the restaurant, read some reviews, and booked our reservation in a matter of 3 minutes.  Woot to technology!    When we got there, the valet and door person greeted us warmly.  The staff were all polite and our waiter was very personable.  He helped us pick out a bottle of wine and explained our menu options with smooth expertise.  I opted for the 6 oz. California cut Prime Rib, as I intended to save room for dessert and drinks later on in the evening. Birthday boy ordered the Diamond Jim Bradly cut.  A hefty 16 oz. and 2 inches thick!  The spinning bowl salad that comes with the entrees was a cute touch, although I think the dressing wasn't really my cup of tea.  The mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding on the side were nice complements.  The pudding reminded me of a popover, airy and crispy on the outside.  We also had creamed spinach, asparagus, and the sizzling mushroom skillet, which was my favorite side.  All went well with the steak.  The steak...oh mylanta!  My prime rib was juicy and tender, melt in my mouth drool all over the table good.  I had the smallest cut out of everyone, but ate so slowly savoring every bite, that I finished last!    We had mentioned that it was our friend's birthday earlier.  At the end of our meal the waiter brought out a slice of some kind of strawberry shortcake and we sang to him while he blew out his candle.  Having stuffed ourselves silly with meat, we opted to share the strawberry cake and save room for drinks.  Hey, what can I say...drinks trump dessert in Vegas!  Do it big!  ;)",

On a side note, I read some reviews about the waitresses uniforms.  They are part of the experience.  It's suppose to be retro. Very happy customer. Service was great too!",

The waiter served us a spinning salad and the Prime Rib was served table-side in a cart. The Prime Rib was not hot at all.   We arrived at 9:30 pm so I'm not sure if we came too late or if the cart temperature wasn't correct.  I was expecting the best Prime Rib that I ever had but the meat temperature could not make that possible.  I prefer a heavy seasoned Prime Rib and mine had hardly any seasoning.  The restaurant was clean and the service was friendly; however, the cost could not be justified based on the quality.",

My problem with prime rib, at most restaurants, is salty. If the meat is good on its own, you would not need much salt because it will overwhelm the real flavor of the meat. The meat here is flavorful on its own. Definitely the best cut and worth the money. The whole prime rib meal is around$50-$60. That includes the delicious salad and 2 sides. The corn is truly delicious.  This place got my praise for service. I came around Christmas and they have caroling. They even came to our table and sang for us. From our waitress to the meat carver. All were very polite.  My top prime rib destination!",

This place is old school mafia chic, with the exception of the patrons who were wearing baggy jeans and flat brimmed caps, reminds me of myself 12 years ago when I first ate at Lawry's. The Food is still as good as it was 12 years ago and the waitresses are still sassy as hell.   Side note, there is a titty bar across the street that doesn't charge an entrance fee, I remember going there when I was 21 and getting a $2 lap dance from cougars. Still there.

So half our party ate while the other half waited for their food. Got mine it was still not done.  They said they'd cook one in the back. So I waited while everyone else ate.  They brought mine out and it was good but it was still not cooked well (done around the perimeter and bright pink in the middle).   I took it home and cooked it.  They were apologetic and took mine  and our side dishes off the bill.  Obviously will not return. Perhaps they are getting business on their reputation of the past.",

Every.  Time.    I prefer the thinly sliced English cut -- very nice because it doesn't overwhelm your mouth.  The spinning salad is tasty.    I had the lobster bruschetta appetizer special one night, and the char on the bread perfectly set off the tangy tomato-basil-balsamic.  Couldn't get enough.    The dining room in Vegas is wonderful art deco.  Just look at the backs of the booths.  Well done, simple, plush upholstery.  And, the people who come here are not trashy.  It's far enough off the strip that folks don't just wander in.  It's a destination for a special occasion.  Gussy up and have a beautiful night in a beautiful town.    Also, their Lawry's VIP program is the best rewards program I've found.  I seem to get a $25 credit on my bill every time I go!    I'm a yelp curmudgeon.  Yet, I highly suggest this restaurant and the rewards program.  I've not found better anywhere.",

My boyfriend took me here for our first trip together and it was heavenly. I waddled out of that restaurant 10 pounds heavier and it was so worth it. We now go at least once a year and have made it a tradition of sorts.   We also tried their asparagus and lobster tails. The asparagus is okay, nothing to write home about so definitely not worth the $9 they charge for it. Lobster tails were very good but their specialty is not seafood so I would not go there for lobster. Just get the prime rib!!!  Thank you Lawrys!! You've introduced me to the wonderful world of prime rib!",

The spinning salad bowl: it's ok, it's more for show vs giving the salad more flavor. The little pudding breads are great for soaking up the prime rib au ju. The prime rib was delicious, I suggest medium. And caution the portions are big , the second size up is just right. Creamed corn: not bad, it's like corn bits in a very sweet n creamy white sauce. Also, let lawrys know if you are there for a special event, you will receive a complimentary dessert, very nice and again a big portion for dessert. Of course beer and cocktails will be at night club pricing. And also, expect a little wait: we had reservations booked 2weeks ago for 8 pm and got in around 8:30 but its worth the wait.",

The chef comes up to the table with the cart and cuts the beef right in front of you.

I usually switch back and forth between the California cut and the Lawry's cut - my hubbie usually always gets the Lawry's cut and the Diamond Jim Brady cut.  The dressing used for the spinning salad is so awesome I ordered a case for our home salads :).  The atmosphere is more casual then the Beverly Hills location which we've frequented as well.  The elegance in the decor is well suited for a very nice dining experience, however some people dine in jean shorts and tanks.",

From our first step into the door, the hostess's professionalism and friendly demeanor was impressive and very welcoming.  The wait time for us to be seated was minimal and the ambiance here is of classic elegance. My hubby and I decided to eat here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and they did not disappoint.  It was the perfect place to celebrate and they sure made our anniversary a memorable one!  My hubby had the Jim Brady cut and I had the Lawry cut.  We both had a side of creamed spinach along with the other accouterments (spinning salad, mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding). And even tho we were stuffed, we had to finish off our meal with their oh so yummy coconut banana cream pie for dessert.  Our server, was very friendly and helpful and added to the enjoyment of our evening.  This was by far the most tastiest prime rib that the both of us have ever eaten.  Both cuts are very generous in size and perfectly seasoned.  They are cooked to perfection and have a rich flavor of meatiness.  You really do not need a knife to cut your prime rib into small pieces as the meat is fork tender.  The prime rib just melts in your mouth and the flavors send you away to a heavenly bliss. And if you thought that was as high as you could be, think again, the Yorkshire pudding is to die for especially when you use it as a mop to soak up all of the juicy goodness from the prime rib.  Just blogging about this is making me salivate and want to jump on the next plane from Hawaii to Vegas to have some of this awesome goodness.  The coconut banana cream pie was gigantic and baked to perfection. Chunks of banana's are mixed together with a Bavarian cream type filling and topped with a fluffy cloud of whipped cream and sprinkled with toasted coconut flakes. The cream is smooth and perfectly sweet and the banana is plentiful and ripe. If I had to guess, I think there was at least 2 whole bananas cut up into chunks in the one slice of pie.  The crust was flaky and perfectly done.    Our whole experience from the beginning to the end of our food high at Lawry's was awesome and addicting. Like an out of control addict, the high that this place gives us, leaves us with an uncontrollable urge and yearning to come back for more and more.  One thing is for sure, this is now our favorite restaurant to feast on  prime rib and we will definitely be back for more the next time we are in the area...that's for sure! ;-)",

    "text": "First, let me say that I am usually not a fan of places that really focus on the presentation of the food, as they usually tend to disappoint me with the actual food.  Lawry's The Prime Rib does well with both.  I was there entertaining clients, and they were impressed by the comfortable dining room, as well as the food.  The Pros: - Comfortable dining room - Great meal (All inclusive dinner with salad and potato side)  addl sides cost extra. - Affordable compared to Del Friscos or Mortons The Cons: - If I am going to nit pic - Selection is limited, but you should know that going in if the place is called The Prime Rib",

    "text": "Out of all the places to go in Las Vegas we choose to go here bc of a reccomendation of my father. Sometimes you just need to get off the strip (but it isnt a far walk if you are coming from Ceasars Palace). The decor is very old Hollywood and the 'retro' theme continues with the wait staff uniforms. While they seem almost silly, it is nice to have a change of pace in appearance and the staff does utilize the etiquette of a time gone past with the introductions and the use of Mr. and Ms. (and heck there is even a thank you,not a 'no problem'. Always good to hear no problem when I am forking over my money for their paycheck). Keep in mind that you do not want to use Open Table for a recommendation to this place b/c when we arrived, the hostess could not find our reservations. You should arrive with an empty stomach b/c the portions are large. Each meal will come with warm sour dough bread and butter, a spinning salad which is rather unique and hearty and then of course the good ol' meat and potatoes. What to say, the prime rib is melt in your mouth and boy is it flavorful! The prices are about 40 ish a place which isn't a buffet price but sometimes a splurge is called for to celebrate a anniversety .",

Although there was this one time I ordered lobster tail, but again, I should know I'm in the middle of a desert so I shouldn't expect seaside quality.  It was still good though, but nothing compares to their prime rib. If u love Denny's or cheap places that serves over flavoring steaks or prime ribs, you prob won't like this place as much. Esp if quantity is more important for u than quality. They put very  simple seasoning, so you can actually taste the quality of the beef. If you know flavor, it doesn't take A1 sauce to make it tasty.  Hopefully my next visit will be like all my others.",

Sign outside states men must remove hats yet there were 3 old codgers wearing baseball caps while eating. One was wearing a t-shirt. Why post dress codes when you are not going to enforce them? My wife had the Lawrys cut prime rib while I had the rib eye. The flavor of the ribeye was great mostly due to the seasoning, I usually get a sirloin but that was not on their menu. Wife usually gets steak medium rare but the prime rib here looked to be a little too bloody for her liking so she got medium. Her steak was very tender but next time she will probably try the same cut medium rare. The spinning salad was very good and just the right size. I got the creme  brulee which was ok, I like mine a bit more eggy in taste. Wife had the coconut banana crime pie and she was in heaven. Service was great at all times, very cool that they wheel out the big cart with the rib roasts so you can see what they are carving off for you.",

We started off in the bar while we were waiting for everyone to show up - quiet and completely unobtrusive.  The bartenders were very friendly and managed to keep us in conversation about the international locations - places we've now vowed to get out to.  When we sat down, the waitress attended to us quickly and in less than 10 minutes, we had our orders down, another round of drinks, and our spinning salad.  We enjoyed that and then the meal came around...  I ended up ordering the California cut (anything larger would have been tremendous) with creamed spinach, a baked potato, and mashed potatoes.  The waitress actually suggested we could go half/half on our sides to make sure we could try others - certainly not a courtesy that I expected.  We couldn't finish the meal - it was so much food we ended up giving the leftovers to my brother's pitbull (she'll tear the hell out of those bones).  Again, I'll be back - a good prime rib place is important to have in LV...just before a visit to the Rhino!",

I was able to book 10 people online at the time I wanted. We were greeted promptly and sat without our entire party being present--which most restaurants won't do anymore. Our server, Ms. Taylor, was amazing! She had us rolling in laughter with her quick wit, sharp tongue and sassy attitude. SHE MADE OUR NIGHT!! You can't go wrong with any cut of Prime Rib at Lawry's. Sprinkle some season salt and pepper on everything and enjoy!",

I've never really dug prime rib and I most certainly wasn't converted after eating at what seems to be known as the class of prime rib eating establishments.  Also, I don't get the vibe here.  I can't decide if the \"classy\" getup they make their waitresses wear is more, less or just as embarrassing as that of a Hooters girl.  And let's face it, Hooters girls are one step away from strippers.  And I feel so sorry for the dudes who cut the prime rib.  If I was one of those guys I'd have suicidal thoughts every time I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror wearing that ridiculous outfit.  It kind of reminds me of how sorry I felt for the 35+ year old McDonald's worker I saw being forced to serve hamburgers while wearing a cheesy train conductor's uniform for some promotion when I was younger.  And its way over-priced, utterly ridiculous.  Then, if you're like me and not really into the whole giant plate with giant slap of dead cow smothered in heavy gravy with mashed potatoes, etc.  This place wont be for you.  Considering all the hype of I've heard about this place over the years, I feel pretty sad to say that the best part of my experience was the free potato chips at the bar and the scoop of plain old vanilla iced cream I had for desert.  How so very, very disappointing.",

Surprisingly there was NO ONE in the lobby or the bar at 8:00 on a Saturday night! That should have been a tip off of how the dinner would go.The main dinning room was not very busy but we were seated in the side back room. We split a shrimp cocktail (which turned out to be the best part of the meal), and when the Prime rib cart came, we were not introduced to the carver, that we later found out was not one of the top carvers ( which we thought was the norm for all Lawry's carvers). My female co worker ordered a California cut, the order was given to the carver and he started cutting, and then I gave my order for a Lawry's cut.... guess what was handed to the server first.... the Lawyr's cut... not the CA cut, which he was told first, AND ordered by the only woman at the table (old school rules of serving her first was ignored) and then we watched the carver basically hack at not 1 but 2 pieces of prime rib and hack saw a piece off... which looked like the exact size as I got.... The Asparagus was underdone and not even ripe, was straw-like on most of the stock. The salad was ok. We both had 1 cocktail eacg. For $148 + tip for just 2 people, we probably won't be back next year. We have a great prime rib in San Diego for 1/2 the price and double the flavor and serving amount. Hopefully the management won't let a Vegas classic die out....",

I had the popular Lawry's cut that came with the usual sides (you can pick your own) but we picked mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and a spinning salad. We also had a glass of wine. She asked for my ID, which is typical for me but it was still embarrassing nonetheless!  I don't get what's so great about the spinning salad except they prepare it right before your eyes. Our server was pleasant and she made small talk while preparing our dishes. She was really sweet in a motherly sort of way, though, I think that's how they all come across.  When the prime rib came out, I was a bit intimidated but the first bite was so tender. The horseradish made it even better. I could barely finish my plate but it was really good, really moist and the mashed potatoes were so good! I didn't really care for the spinach but it was tasty too.  The only thing that really tasted weird was the yorkshire pudding - does anyone really eat this? I didn't get it...and I took a bite but it just wasn't for me.  If you love prime rib, you should come here. They also have things like surf & turf! Also, they were hosting a future mystery game dinner thing, where they play Clue with a group of people and you try to figure out who's murder. That seems fun :)",

I honestly dont know where they went wrong, prime rib and all the accompaniments were only mediocre at best! And for the price 39$ for 10oz I felt ripped off! I wanted to steal the salt and pepper blends to at least make up for a rather lackluster meal, I really was looking forward to my trip there and was very disappointed, prime rib was tough and no flavor, creamed spinach was flavorless, and mashed potato was almost soup consistency ! For a place that specializes in spices everything left a lot to be desired! Service was prompt and friendly, but waitress got bogged down with a big party and left us wanting refills on drinks. I heard her ask for help , but her co-workers were too \"busy\" to provide any ( they actually were on the other side talking, c'mon teamwork people!!) we would have gotten at least another glass of wine, but dinner was almost done and at that point it wasn't really worth the effort, of tracking the server down, ( she was busy making salads for her party) she was very apologetic on her absence , but it made us feel bad for her, not really the atmosphere you want to have when dining out! Only good thing was salad and bread, 5 stars for those and about 2 1/2 for everything else!!",

I didn't know it is a chain and not only that, and it was only until I sat at the table I figured that it is the same Lawry's as the bottles of meat seasoning at any supermarket.  The restaurant is very nice and is a throwback to Hollywood of the 1950's.  The staff and service are excellent and exudes gracious and grand service of the past.  I especially like the waitresses with their retro outfits and the nametags that addresses them as Miss something.  I love a good piece of cow, but I am not a huge eater, so I was a bit horrified to see cooks and waitors moving giant slabs of beef across the room.  I shared a shrimp cocktail (which was good but not great as I thought it a tad over cooked) and a calamari plate (good, but also a bit overcooked) as an appetizer.  When the restaurant has Prime Rib in it's name, you got to order it and I am glad I did, though next time I would probably try the rib-eye steak as it also looked good.  The spinning salad was a bit gimmicky, but it made for a great chilled salad with the dressing perfectly coated lightly in every bite.  The shredded beets was much appreciated in the salad.   Not prepared to eat an obscene amount of beef I ordered the English cut which is three large slices cut extra thin, it was one of the smaller portions on the menu.  I had it rare and it was soooo good, it almost melted in my mouth.  It would be crime to order your prime rib any more than medium, the rarer the better. The two types of horseraddish sauce served at the table were a nice touch.  The regular horseraddish sauce was wasabi-like strong and the creamed horseraddish sauce was very mild, almost buttery.   The potatoes and gravy on the side were perfect, however the Yorkshire pudding was a bit disappointing.  I am a lover of Yorkshire pudding and only had it in the U.K. so I was expecting a light flaky individual portion of pastry bowl filled with gravy, but this was more bread-like and doughy in the middle and the portion was cut from a large bowl piece.  This must me the American version of it.  The final tab was very reasonable considering the amount of food and the quality of service provided.  My share of the tab was about $75 and that included two killer martinis which I requested with their excellent hand stuffed blue cheese olives.  Forget Ruth Chris' Steakhouse and Morton's, this is my new favorite steak restaurant.",

    "text": "Eh - I was a bit underwhelmed. Maybe I had too high of expectations. I thought this place was going to be a bit more upscale, like a Mortons. The place looked a bit shabby to me, and the food was mediocre. We came on Thanksgiving night and admittedly had turkey instead of prime rib - I know prime rib is the thing here, and maybe my review would be different if I had that. The turkey dinner with all of the trimmings was okay, but I honestly thought the identical meal I had at Koo-Koo-Roo a few days earlier was superior. I was not a fan of the spinning salad at all.   Service was polite, but I personally don't like places where they get all creative with the presentation. The spinning salad was prepared by a guy who thought he was an extra in the movie Cocktail, and the uniforms and medallions worn by the servers bordered on ridiculous. Spare me the theatrics; just feed me yummy food.   If you are bringing all of your elderly relatives out to dinner, this may be a decent place - it had that vibe. But for me, there are so many fabulous restaurants in Vegas that I can't imagine coming back here.",

I ordered the California Cut, which was just the right size for me. I enjoyed the Yorkshire Pudding, as I'd never had it before! And the potatoes were creamy and delicious. The spinach was just okay, I wasn't a big fan.   The staff are really helpful and very courteous. I was the only girl at the table, and the waiter just HAD to serve me first (But I guess that's customary of all fancy schmancy restaurants -- and all good restaurants, eh? I'm learning, slowly, slowly...).   I would go back I suppose, but there are way more restaurants I'd want to try in Vegas first. But that's just me...antsy to get up and go...and remember, I'm not a big steak and potatoes girl...  But if you are, by all means...head on down!",

The moment we landed in Vegas, our mission was straight to lawrys ... we did not miss one second ... felt bad because we got there an hour before they closed .. not busy, kind of nice tempo actually.  Ms. Amy took the most amazing care of us, she was patient with our dumb questions, she was playful with our comments and most of all she was efficient, attentive and just all around so sweet and so nice .. the food was banging! We went all out, craft cocktails were unique (twists on classic craft cocktails)... went with a bottle of Malbec with the meal .. we all did lawry signature cuts which when served we were in heaven as the master carver skillfully executed and presented us with our bounty of amazing food! .. creamed corn was I think the best side! ... definitely left full and did not eat till the next day! Probably the most decadent lunch I've had in a long time! Thank you ms. Amy.",

    "text": "They can't even cook a decent filet mignon! If I had the choice I would give ZERO stars. Horrible service, even worse cooked food. Lawry's has the reputation of being an \"upscale\" restaurant, but that was far from it during our last visit. When sitting with a party we should all be served relatively close together, however half of the table was served from the carving cart and the remainder of the party waited OVER ten minutes after the cart left to be served from \"back in the kitchen\". That is absolutely unacceptable. No apology was given by our server nor a Manager. My filet mignon was ordered medium, it was served to me RAW. I brought it to our servers attention and she apologized and took the steak back into the kitchen, this same exact piece of steak was brought back to me THREE times. Three times. Twice it was still cooked under medium and once it was cooked over....well yeah they've botched this poor filet. Finally on the fourth ask, I had to ask for a new piece of steak, they were going to keep bringing me the same piece. I asked to speak to a Manager, no Manager ever came to speak to me. Highly upset about the steak they attempted to serve to me four times, and I left hungry. The remainder of our party was disrupted by the lack of service we received due to the incident of my filet mignon. Won't be returning, and will be sharing my experience with anyone who will listen.",

    "text": "Delicious!  Everything was absolutely delicious!!   My BF and I decided to celebrate our 2 year anniversary dinner here. We were seated almost immediately after arriving since we had reservations. The restaurant was very intimate and the lighting was perfect. Our waiter, he said to call him Mr. P since his name was complicated, was friendly.   We started off our dinner with some calamari. It was probably one of the best calamari I've had. It was fried perfectly and crispy. The octopus itself was not rubbery at all. The marinara and aoli sauces were flavorful. Just remember that prime rib dinners come with salad and potatoes already so don't go crazy on ordering sides.  Next was the spinning bowl salad which Mr. P made for us table side. The dressing tasted like a smokey thousand island which was so good. The vegetables were fresh and crisp. I usually hate croutons because they are usually so hard. But these croutons were crunchy.   After our salads, Mr. P came around with our carver (forgot his name) along with the prime rib cart. I ordered the California cut (smaller portion) and my BF ordered the Lawry cut (their most popular). They cut our meat from a gigantic portion of meat and poured the delicious as jus. This is where they put the mashed potatoes and any other sides on your plate. I ordered the creamed corn as well. The prime rib was rich, soft and melt in your mouth. The potatoes were smooth and the creamed corn was the creamiest ever.   At the end of our meal, Mr. P comped a little bundt cake for us to celebrate our anniversary, which I thought was such a nice gesture. This is the kind of dining experience where you take your time and enjoy each course. Nothing is rushed, so expect to spend more time enjoying your food and company. Just remember not to fill up on salad or apps before the meat comes.   Overall, we had an amazing dining experience and an amazing anniversary.",

The most accommodating of any restaurant we've been to with them. The atmosphere is like straight out of the 40's. It's nice and classy. The reason for three stars is because of the food. The guys got the prime rib, I ordered the filet Oscar, and my gf friend ordered a filet as well. My filet was ordered medium and it was served medium rare, but also it was difficult to even cut because it was so squishy. Not tough or rubbery, but almost like it had a lot of fat in it? Anyhow, it was flavorless. The guys said the prime rib wasn't anything to brag about and my gf friend said the same thing about her perfectly cooked filet. The sides were good though. When we brought my filet to our waitresses attention she said she could take it off. It was $65 and we ended up only getting $15 off. Anyhow, it was overrated in our opinion. Overall, not worth the $300 spent.",

    "text": "This place is a must try if you even moderately enjoy Prime Rib! Since it's my favorite cut of meat I was in heaven.  I have to admit I had never heard of this restaurant until recently.   Mom really wanted to enjoy a QUALITY meal that was guaranteed to be delicious but also \"Fancy\" for her Birthday Meal. The only catch is my Mom is one of those picky eaters who really doesn't like many \"foodie\" favorites.   Luckily I was able to reach out to one of my friends who just so happened to recommend Lawry's. I trust his opinion of course but I also checked out the reviews and saw a lot of my yelp pals also gave Lawry's big thumbs up.  If you're planning to check this place out I would recommend heading to their website to check for specials. I luckily went on the site to make our reservation and spotted their August deal \" Surf & Turf for two for $99\" it included a 6oz California Cut prime rib and Lobster tail with Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes , spinning salad plus dessert for two. This is an amazing deal.   Initially upon arrival I thought valet was required but right as we were about to valet we saw the self-parking. When we walked in we were greeted right away. Our reservation was for 6:30 on a Saturday night but we got there a bit early and we got lucky enough to be seated right away. When we first entered the dining area I literally felt like I could hear a pin drop but essentially anyone with food in front of them was busy eating and not worrying with talking. It's definitely a very intimate setting and totally someplace I found romantic lol..   Our waitress arrived shortly after we were seated and she was friendly right off the bat. When she realized we had never been before she gave the run down on how it works but they don't outwardly mention the specials which is why I recommend checking it out! We started our meal off with two cocktails and the Shrimp Cocktail appetizer. This is worth every penny in my opinion. Yes, you don't get many shrimp and its double digits but they taste delicious and look pretty!!! You get complimentary bread and it tastes yummy but don't waste too much space on that if you can help it!!  I'm not going to break down the whole entire meal because A- this place has tons of reviews and B- I don't want to leave you with a Novel..   I will say that my favorite part about this place aside from how friendly and attentive everyone was is the meat cart. Now that may seem silly but as I stated earlier my Mom is picky. The carver comes to your table and you get to specify how you want your meat cooked. Since she is one of those people who like everything WELL DONE but still edible this worked perfectly. Especially since I like my meat practically raw and can't relate to her choices at all. We each were able to get an amazing piece of Prime Rib.. That is also where you get your sides ...I opted to add on cream corn for $7 and it was worth every penny! I loved it...  By the time it was all said and done we couldn't finish our food and went home with left overs and our dessert to go.. I upgraded one of them for $3 for the sticky toffee pudding .. We didn't end up getting to try the ice cream but everyone raves about it..  This was an overall amazing dining experience that I hope to enjoy again. I wish I would have joined their VIP club to give me an excuse to come back again soon. I have tried a few Vegas hot spots for prime rib / meat and this so far is my favorite for the price . Is it expensive? Sure but I left there feeling like I got my money's worth for sure! Next time I probably won't waste stomach space on appetizers but thanks to the special we got a full four course meal plus two drinks for $170.00. That doesn't include tip and please if you do go here and get good service consider leaving generously they have to share that $ with the variety of awesome folks who are making this a fun experience.",

She also has a very in your face personality and is unprofessional at times. SHE IS THE REASON WE WILL MOST LIKELY NOT GIVE THIS PLACE A 2ND CHANCE!!!  3.) Waited very long to be greeted, have our order taken, to be checked on after we received our food, and for our check.   4.) no explanation of how the menu worked so we started ordering and then were told no that's not how it is and then still gave us a careless, hurried explanation of how the process is.   5.) there was a misunderstanding with the check that the waitress admitted that it was her fault, but still spoke to us with disdain in her voice as if we were inconveniencing her.   Food was okay. Prime rib was above average. Mash potatoes, creamed spinach, mushrooms all average. Lobster & bread were delicious.   Service to me is just as important as the food. After this I don't think I could ever go back and if I do I will definitely make sure Taylor is not our waitress.",

I would have given this place a 5 however our server wasn't as friendly or informational about the establishment. He never explained the history or business of this place. We had a party of 7 and this was my families first time here which we stated. At the Chicago location we had the whole spew of this wonderful restaurant but in Vegas - nada.  He did offer sides of cream corn and spinach but forgot to mention there was an additional charge for those. We were thinking it came with the meal.  The desserts were just okay  Free valet parking",

    "text": "As part of my birthday celebration, my husband made dinner reservation in advanced, in hope to give me great experience.   Lawry could easily have at least a solid 4-star. As we arrived last night, the valet gentleman was very friendly and advised where to self park (velvet is complimentary); he even opened the front door for us as we were walking toward the door.   Now you might think why 3 stars? Well, when we arrived at 6:40 for our 7pm reservation, the male host did not even give us eye contact at first, he was looking down when saying his \"hi\"; after we told him that we have dinner reservation at 7p, another couple walked in, the host then asked us to wait for a moment. Another gentleman came to guide us to our table; while the restaurant was half empty, he gave us this corner L shape tiniest seating. For a moment there, I was thinking maybe it's because we were small party, then we looked around, there were many party of 2 were seated at the larger booths by the wall.  As much as I hate to use the word \"racist\", they made me feel like they were because the couples seated at the larger booths were Caucasians. About 30 seconds later, we also saw the host personally escorted the couple who walked in behind us (Caucasian) to one of the larger booth by the wall.   I was unhappy that we were the only ones who were seated at end table when the restaurant was half empty and we had reservation; in fact, we were the only ones seated at that session. Call it racist or special treatment if you would, but this was unacceptable; we were just going to leave, fortunately our server Ashley made the change and had us to be seated at one of the larger booth. Throughout the dinner, we also noticed the host only escorted people who were not Asian, he asked another gentleman to take all Asian customers to their table. I was very confused, because he was Asian himself, why treated Asian differently?    Now on to the food; we ordered 2 prime ribs, 3 lobster tails, mushrooms, creamy corns, and a bottle of Cabernet. The prime rib was cooked to perfection, every bite was juicy and savoring; we added the lobster tails to make like surf and turn, the lobster were fresh and good as well.   Our server Ashley was very friendly, patience, paid attention to details and very professional to explain the history and menu. At the end of the dinner, I only ordered espresso but Ashley surprised me with a red velvet cake for my birthday. As we left, the same velvet guy said good night to us with a bright smile; we tipped him for his friendly attitude.  Overall it was a great experience; if it was not the host, I would have given 5 stars.",

    "text": "This could end up being a novel of review.  The people I went with were balling like they were in the NBA.   Normally a girl like me going to this place, she orders an entree and calls it a day.   But I feel like I ended up trying like 5 different apps.   We got the lobster bruschetta, super tasty.   The shrimp cocktail, good for shrimp cocktail but seriously, aren't most of them kinda the same.   The calamari was very good.  I wasn't blown away but enjoyed each bite that went into my mouth.  And lastly, oysters.   It was my husbands first raw oyster experience so he has no comparison that he can make but they weren't gritty. For a person who has had oysters million times, the oysters were very fresh and meaty. Not just pathetic oysters as at some other places.   Now onto the main dish.  It comes with an Salad, your prime rib and mashed potatoes.     ASK FOR THE GARLIC MASHED INSTEAD.  YOU CAN THANK ME LATER WITH A PRESENT THAT WE CAN DISCUSS THE CONTENTS OF LATER.    I got the Lawry cut.  It was a good size.  I would definitely not get the bigger one.  Chances are for most of us, it would not be eaten.  Uber flavorful and cooked perfectly.   Tender as hell.   After talking about the meat it's hard to go back to the salad but it was actually really well dressed and something that I wish I could make at home.    This place is fancy but you don't have to wear a dress or anything.   I would say, dress respectfully.   Service is great.   But at places like this, if you aren't a top of the line server, you aren't gonna last.   Would go back for a special occasion.  My wallet would definitely get a bit lighter but my scale would do the opposite.",

    "text": "Do you love steak without all the extravagance these days? 28 day dry-aged steak for $80+ and no sides included? You won't find that here. Forget the other fancy steakhouses in Vegas with a la carte $10 sides. Lawry's has an old-fashioned feel from the all-inclusive meal to the tableside prime rib carving.   The menu is kept simple with different types of prime rib cuts, a ribeye steak (boneless and bone-in), and some seafood options as well as a beef Wellington. All the dinners include the famous original spinning bowl salad, which is also prepared tableside. The croutons are amazing.   Since I've tried the different cuts of steak, I went with the beef Wellington. It was marvelously cooked - the tenderloin was juicy and tender. The shallot Beaujolais sauce was divine. If that wasn't enough, the scalloped potatoes and herb crusted tomato was sure to fill me up. I tried a bite of the Lawry cut prime rib, which was tender, but nowhere as good as the 24 oz. bone-in ribeye steak. The ribeye had so much more flavor and that wonderful sear. Don't forget the Yorkshire pudding, which adds on to the excessive amount of food.   Lawry's has great service and is a classic institution for prime rib and steak!",

We brought another couple with us that have never been to Lawry's and they went along with us when ordering the prime rib Lawry's cut portion. I was shocked when the meat was served to all 4 of us. My wife and I had just ate here 4 weeks ago and we're completely stuffed. As for this trip it was no joke, half the portion. We asked about it and a manage came by and offered us another portion. She then proceeded to offer 4 slices of roast beef sized  prime rib for a sandwich. Just down right embarrassing for us as we ranted over how we lived this place to our friends. My cream of corn was weak this time. The  pictures are from our last visit.",

This is all good and well, except that they also seem to hold onto the addage that kids should not be at the table.  I have come here before a couple of times, and have always enjoyed my food and the pomp and circumstance.  I had however, never brought a child with me.  Now that I have a grandson, we do take him everywhere and expose him to as much as we can.  (it's what I did with my kids too).  I really didn't think it was going to be an issue.  We made reservations early, we were there at opening.  The hostess was happy and very accommodating.  She asked if he was allowed to color, and I said yes, but he doesn't understand the concept of paper and would draw on your tablecloth.  She responded with that is quite alright.  We don't do the laundry ourselves, anyways.  I thought WOW, they are really accommodating.    She brought my grandson, the crayons and the paper.  We had been introduced to our server, I believe a Mrs. Bender.  She was all business and IMMEDIATELY corrected my grandson for drawing on the tablecloth and took away his crayons.  With a tisk tisk.  Between her and another server, there was a lot of eye rolling going on.  They were not happy that a child was at THEIR table.  I was very offended by all this, but because we were someone else's guest and I didn't want to upset her, I stayed quiet.  Lawry's you get a ZERO for service this night.  You have no patience for your younger guests.  Your food was good, but with the competition you have in Vegas now, I won't be rushing to your doorstep anytime soon.",

When you walk into the restaurant, the bar area is off to the right.  We were seated in the back dining area.  The decor is beautiful and classy. Our waitress for the evening was Rhonda.  So perky and fun! I didn't notice it but she pointed out her similar looks to Flo from the progressive commercials.  Funny! She was such a doll and so happy.    We started out with the Lobster Bruschetta.  Not a ton of lobster but the tomatoes were fresh on top of the delicious bread.  I need mention the sourdough bread basket that is brought to the table.  Warm and so tasty!  When you order the prime rib dinner, salad, Yorkshire pudding and potatoes are included.  They prepare and spin the salad in front of the table.  Delicious house dressing topped with egg, croutons and beets.  Pretty soon the prime rib cart is rolled over to the table.  Everything is cut in front of you.  Your plate is prepared before your eyes.  Oh my!!! The prime rib was absolutely perfect.  So tender and succulent.  The house special potatoes were some of the best I've ever had. I fell in love immediately!  It was the first time having Yorkshire pudding.  Really it's just like an airy bread but complimented the meal delightfully!   Lawrys delivers phenomenal service and fabulous food!  Truly a memorable evening!",

I came here with one of my friends and made a reservation. Not sure how long the wait would have been but there wasn't anyone else in the waiting area. We were seated quickly and our server Ariel was energetic and knowledgeable. She was able to give good wine suggestions and food pairings. I don't normally eat meat but I have a few cheat days and since Im on vacation whyyyyyyy not!! We ordered the filet 8oz with a lobster tail and the lawrys cut. I didn't want the second side and i was able to get corn but it is an upcharge and they do charge it as its full side. Now presentation is everything. They cut the meat in front of you...they make this salad in front of you as well as present you with a seasoning for the salad.  Food was actually perfect and filling. We had more than enough to take home. It is on the costlier side. Only took my friend here because she deserved it but most of my friends wouldn't make this VIP treatment cut hahahahaha (kidding...maybe...) About $200 for two entrees and two glasses of wine..didn't get appetizers. But again food, fabulous. Reheated the next day and enjoyed it just as much. Had a great experience!!",

I'm not crazy about prime rib, but that's what my mom wanted and since I'm here where it's they're specialty, I should try it. The prime rib was just ok. The sides were mediocre and underwhelming. We tried the mashed potatoes, baked potato, creamed spinach, creamed corn and mushrooms (good) . For the app we had the calamari (good). For dessert we had the cheesecake and creme brulee. Drinks - martini, moscato, red wine. The check came to $320 for 3ppl. We most enjoyed the calamari, mushrooms, cheesecake, drinks, and service (lawless--he was awesome).

It came on a simple hoagie roll fill with shaved pastrami and rare beef with au jus dipping sauce on the side. No need for other toppings.  House-made chips and potato salad. It looked small, the whole meal was delicious.   The General Manager paid a courtesy visit. I guess because we were all Suits. Haha! Still very nice.",

The waiter has been serving customers here since 1998, man oh man, he was so friendly and  very informative when it came time to order. I had the English cut which was three thin slices and my bf had the Lawry cut.  Each order came with tossed salad, mashes potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, and horse radish.   When the carving chef came out with the big silver heated oven, I was in awe as he prepared our steaks. The steak was nicely cooked medium. Easy to chew and savory with garnishes on top. The creamed corn I had as a side dish was so sweet and the buttery flavor exploding in my mouth like fireworks. My bf enjoyed his Lawry's cut with a side of creamed spinach. But he prefers the steaks his mom cooks.   Free valet parking complimentary from the restaurant and the staff were all friendly and professional mannered. It is good to give this place a try if you willing to open up your wallet :P",

Which was very talented-ly spun and mixed. Next was the prime rib station that was wheeled to our table.  We got the California cut with mashed potatoes, gravy, au ju, and yorkshire pudding.  The prime rib was succulent and delicious.  We will definitely be back soon to satisfy our prime rib cravings.",

Prime rib is synonymous with Vegas, and why not go to a place with quality assurance by way of brand reliability.  Place didn't disappoint, including the \"theater,\" which involves hauling a giant metallic cart in front of you, then slicing the prime rib and preparing salad tableside. Our server was awesome and told us about her years in the business, then said NIC CAGE is her favorite celebrity customer and a really \"nice guy.\" What?! I thought he LEFT LAS VEGAS. (Dark joke, actually, if you think of the plot of the movie, plus Nic Cag's various life travails in the past couple decades.)  A word on portions: I've griped about \"California portions\" here multiple times when it comes to steak. Sick of getting a teeny slab of meat, eating it in 5 minutes, then still being hungry. Lawry's isn't quite Chicago and East Coast portions, but it's enough not to leave angry and frustrated. This place is a #MerlinFIVE  As if the food wasn't enough, John A. conducted an interview with a Washington Post reporter during dinner. The resulting story is just a gem. Take a look! <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2F2019%2F07%2F12%2Fnets-clippers-won-free-agency-most-important-their-fans-knicks-lakers-didnt%2F%3Futm_term%3D.4375e4cbc23b&s=bdb13da3e616c87a6047b0d382c4ea219b9215e10f05e1100b3b62812afdc0f0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">washingtonpost.com/sport...</a>",

I loved the cream spinach and creamed corn and souffle. There are so many restaurant workers and staff. They are very nice and professional.

From entering the front door til the very last bits of dessert and my coffee, everything was of HIGH QUALITY and FIRST CLASS!  The Ladies at the Front was gracious in helping us to our Booth (as 3 of us are disabled individuals, and 2 are legally blind), and the Mgr/Supervisor on duty welcomed us as well, as we passed by.  Our server, MR. (DREW) CASERI treated us with dignity and respect, and did his VERY BEST in making us comfortable! Lawry's Management...if you are reading this review, this Gentleman deserves recognition for going above and beyond, and taking EXTREME PRIDE in his \"Profession\". We 3 were VERY BLESSED to have been seated in his area. ALOHA & MAHALO, Mr. Caseri!!!  The Food was EXCELLENT, as we each had the 3 different cuts (Lawry's 10oz Cut, Brady 16oz Cut, and Bowl 22oz Cut) of Prime Rib, and ALL was unbelievably tender, flavorful, and SATISFYING! The sides of Mash, Creamy Spinach and Sizzling Mushroom were amazing as well. We finished this Hearty Meal off with a Scoop of Chocolate Ice Cream, an Ice Cream Sundae, and a Cup of Coffee, respectively.  MAHALO, Lawry's and their Wonderful Staff!!! I will DEFINITELY be back!",

They sat us at our table and the server gave us the background on Lawry's.  He made our salad table side and the salad was super tasty!  I ate all mines but since I did that I couldn't finish my Prime Rib.    We all ordered the California Cut Prime Rib and it was really tasty.  There are 4 different sizes of cuts with the California cut being the smallest of the four cuts.  They wheel out this huge silver covered wagon with the prime rib slab and cut your meat table side as well.  Also on the wagon is the whipped potatoes, gravy, creamed spinach and creamed corn.  The food came out really fast and it was hot.   Being that our reservations were really late, there were not many patrons and I do believe that we were the last party to be seated that evening.  The servers were very knowledgeable and did their job well!",

The servers wear really cute outfits and the service is superb. Now, let's talk food. They are known for their Prime Rib dinners, the ordering process is also unique. They ask what you'd like, I selected Prime rib, they bring out a huge warmer and a chef slices the prime rib to your liking. You are given choices of sides and your meal is given to you.  It's a wonderful experience and absolutely worth going. It is a steakhouse in Vegas, so be aware that the prices can be higher than normal.",

It started great, there was a dress code the lobby was beautiful and the cocktail i had as i waited for my party was expertly crafted. We were seated fairly quickly and that's where the greatness ended. We were seated at about five thirty as we planned to attend a concert after dinner around 8:30 at a nearby casino. We did not receive our dinner until seven. over an hour and a half. We did not order appetizers. Drink refills with the exception of the kindly gentlemen keeping our water topped off were no existent. Our waitress was nowhere to be seen and i think the most frustrating part was seeing our fellow patrons that had arrived sometime after us eat and leave before we had eaten anything. I do understand that it was a holiday and of course it will take a bit longer however most tables around us were empty, in fact it didn't fill up until a half our before we left. When we asked our invisible waitress what the hold up was she said it was because some in our party did not order off the cart, but i cant say i believed her as while we were waiting we noticed that the other patrons being served had ordered what we had and they still got their dinner in a timely manner.  As for the food i just cant say it was worth the wait. The Meat was not cooked to order, i had ordered medium rare but it was closer to well, the salad was not very appetizing, the other sides were just ok. The lava cake did not have chocolate inside but strangely on top with a dry chocolate cake underneath.  I will say the scalloped potatoes were excellent but at the prices that are charged i expected something truly mouthwatering.  Needless to say we missed the concert but we were just ready to leave in any case.",

    "text": "This is, amazingly, only a review for the lunch special, or the ale and sandwich bar.  I can't believe I haven't been here for dinner yet, but I'll get there.  The lunch is beyond solid, probably the best deal when considering quality, amount of food, and cost I have found in the valley.  Each day, they have a special:  prime rib sandwich, turkey sandwich, soup and sandwich, etc.  Also, you can simply get the prime rib sandwich.  This entitles you to go to the fixings bar, where they have a few sauces, pickles, onions, potato salad, and pasta salad at the very least.  On some days, the bar is more substantial than other days.  When you return to your table, you find homemade potato chips waiting, of course with Lawry's seasoning salt for flavor.  It's a fantastic, and QUICK lunch service.  You sit down, give your drink order, then go to the bar and order.  Less than 5 minutes later, you are back seated and eating.  Great for those working and don't have time for a super long lunch, but don't want fast food.  The most expensive sandwich is the prime rib at $16.  That's still a FANTASTIC deal for the amount of food you get, and it's Lawry's quality, carved right off the bone.  You can get full plates as well of either prime rib or turkey with all of the sides.  But, given how much food you get with the sandwich specials, I've never had to.  If you are in the area, or even if you aren't, it's a fantastic lunch.  11:30 - 2:00.",

We get the salad and meh I tasted better it was ok. I get the entree and better than I expected. Creme brulee was a little on the bland side. After I paid the $140.00 bill.

But if you're there for the quality of the food, not the glitz and glamour, then you'll be happy.   Definitely make a reservation just in case (and there's a private room in the back if you have a large group), and be prepared for the waitstaff to be a little slow (though very friendly).",

My husband and I started with a glass of wine in the bar, after being shown to our table (they pull the whole table out so you can sit without sliding around the booth!) our server greeted us, took our drink order and gave us time to review the menu.  We had the calamari app, nicely fried with a wonderful spicy dipping sauce. I have to add you don't need an app save room for desert instead!  After finishing our app we had the Spinning Salad, its a fun presentation the croutons crunch and melt in your mouth! it was awesome!  I ordered the \"california\" cut, hubby the Lawry's cut, both served with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. I added the creamed spinach, it is wonderful, hubby got the mushrooms they were great too. The star of the evening, the prime rib is spectacular! Melt in your mouth meaty goodness.  I love how they wheel the huge silver serving buffet to slice your cut of meat table side, serving your sides hot and fresh, its spectacular!   Some reviews I read on Yelp people complained about added cost of the sides, the menu clearly states what is included and what is extra so before complaining maybe you should read a little better?   Over all dinner was awesome, the food was spectacular, with wonderful rich flavor, a great date night out with a fun throw back ambiance highly recommend you try it at least once",

I did the 24 oz Ribeye and could not get enough. One of the tastiest pieces of meat I have had. Came with scalloped potatoes and the onion strings and Yorkshire pudding! Was delicious.   The spinning salad bowl was amusing AND the salad was very tasty. Our waiter, Mr. Goyal was really great. I loved seeing the waitresses in retro garb.   This place is not to be missed when in Vegas. I normally do not go back to the same places during my yearly trip to Vegas, but I am making an exception for this place.  I would suggest arriving 15 minutes early and enjoy a cocktail in the bar area.",

The spun salad had egg, and the dressing was similar to in n out spread to me. I didn't really enjoy it to be honest. Next, I'm not sure if I just don't like prime rib as much as other cuts, but this just wasn't as tasty as other steakhouses for me :( the mashed potatoes were pretty good, and the creme brulee was excellent. It was torched to a perfect crisp. Not sure if I would return, I think I'm more of a filet mignon girl.",

She was attentive and kind.   Our table did order two apps. I did not sample either. We had the spinning salad. the dressing was tasty. The salad well dressed. They looked delicious.  Then came the carving cart. Three large roasts. I elected well done. I was given an end cut. I selected peas and spinach. I did not realize it was only one vegetable. They gave me both. The meat was perfectly cooked. The potatoes very good. Liked the gravy. The spinach and peas were yum.  No room for dessert.  A very nice experience.",

The bad news is, I will never be satisfied with anything less. Since it was Christmas they had a group of carolers going from table to table taking requests!  it was awesome we had them sing the hippopotamus song and Dreidel Dreidel.   The establishment is decorated in classic Art Deco style, and the service is something straight out of the Gilded Age. We ordered appetizers; mine was the giant shrimp cocktail. Our waitress mixed the salad with a theatrical flourish right at the table. Then a waiter came to the table with a cart resembling a miniature 1930s Airstream trailer, which opened to reveal a huge roast, from which he carved servings of the requested degree of doneness. This was served with an exquisite Yorkshire pudding and, in my case, creamed spinach. Unfortunately, I didn't have room for dessert but I got some anyways...the Creme Brulee, which was sublime.",

    "text": "Is this what it's like to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth? I would hate for anyone to be born with a silver spoon in their mouths cuz that sucks!  Everything just isn't as good or enjoyable once you've had the ultimate undeniable best... While everyone here is giving Lawry's \"THE PRIME RIB\" 4 n 5 stars I'm here baffled.  Perhaps HOPR (House of Prime Rib) in SF was my silver spoon this entire time... Consistently serving juicy tender cuts of premium well aged prime rib with sides that make anything at Lawry's, well, unworthy of such an upper class palate that belongs to the family of HOPR.  Their service feels old here... as in outdated.  Whereas HOPR is classic and retains class.  At Lawry's, the female servers look like they jumped right out of our old history textbooks dressed like women from days of the 13 colonies looking like the pilgrim women or even nurses from the 60's.  Do you need a flu shot?  They probably have some in their apron as an add option to your meal.  Service was friendly but rather inefficient.  It's hard to explain.  You just have to try both Lawry's and HOPR to understand.  When I hear \"Lawry's THE PRIME RIB\", I'm literally thinking OMG we need to bow down... it's Lawry's THE PRIME RIB god.  Calling yourself \"THE\" Prime Rib kind of gives the sense that there was no one before you, no one after you, and no one will ever even come close to you.  But then again, the loudest one is usually the weakest one, and this was surely the case here.  My prime rib was ordered medium rare.  My cousin to my right and my best friend to my left also ordered the same.  It came out more like medium maybe medium well.  What didn't help was that they gave us butter knives to cut into this steak.  Oh wait... I think that was subliminally suppose to tell us that you can cut into this beef like butter.  Good one guys... almost fell for it there, but I'm from the family tree of HOPR... can't fool me that easily.  There must be something wrong with the aging process of the prime rib here because it was tough and fibrous to the chew.  I thought maybe if I ate the outer parts of the rib cut where the fats and tendon are then it'd be more tender but no it was rather dry.  My friend and I went straight to the bone and even that was on the medium side.  Medium wouldn't be that bad if the beef was aged better for a tastier and softer bite, but that not the case.  I took a couple of bites and left the rest of it there but I ate the mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and creamed corn to help soak up the alcohol for the later part of the night.  With about 3/4 of the steak still sitting on my plate, the bussers and server never asked why I barely touched it as they took it away.  I didn't want to say anything either to be respectful because Lawry's was the bachelor's favorite prime rib spot to grub at.  One thing is for sure though... my cousin, my best friend, and I are taking him to our silver spoon, HOPR, next week to show him what a great well aged prime rib is supposed to be like.  We'll even throw in an actual steak knife and let him use the butter knife to spread his butter.  It wouldn't even take the steak for the bachelor to change his allegiance to HOPR... Just the warm soft fluffy bread to start would be enough.  If Harry Chapin got to eat at HOPR and Lawry's while he was editing his lyrics, us 70's and 80's babies would probably know the song to go like:  And the cat's in the cradle and HOPR too. Little boy blue and the man on the moon. When you coming home dad? I don't know when. We'll go to House of Prime Rib then, son... You know we'll have a good rib then.",

Course 2: Obviously, I chose the prime-rib and man was it enormous and savory!  The  put a little too much sauce on my rib but I didnt mind because they give you some sort of Yorkshire pudding to soak up all that sauce.   On the side I had mashed potatoes and the creamy corn.  The mashed potatoes was mediocre and the creamy corn wasnt as tasteful as I thought it would be.  Course 3: My favorite course! Dessert was REMARKABLE! I got the sundae and asked for extra chocolate fudge. yummm :)   Service: We were seated quickly and greeted with our very charming waitress. She was very amusing and had a magnificent bright smile. Overall, she was absolutely wonderful and I wish I remembered her name because I would have definitely call her manager how pleasant she was..  Experience/Atmosphere:  Everything was great.

The restaurant seemed to fill up quickly, but emptied equally fast. The prime rib is served on rolling carts with accompaniments. Table side salad service. Great mixed drinks. Good desserts.

And let me tell you, the prime rib here is not only amazing, but huge! None of the meats are precut of course, and are not even cut in the kitcken in the back. The prime rib is cut right there in front of your eyes and onto a large plate where they also ask what kind of sides you want to accompany it as well. Man... is it good.

    "text": "If you love prime rib and old fashioned service, this is the place to go. We were with \"meat & potatoes only\" family members and so we brought them here because the menu is strong and simple; pretty much just meat & potatoes. They loved it.   This is a great place to bring clients, or take a group of people who want a really fun & unique prime rib experience. The prime rib was melt-in-your-mouth perfection, served tableside from huge gleaming metal carts, cut and carved to order (doneness, size, etc) by servers in chefs hats, coats, and ... get this... white gloves.   You're also personally attended by a waitress in a very unique costume; and boy does the waitstaff know their stuff. You'll not get bad service here, EVER. All orders will be perfect, all drinks will be refilled before they can even get to half empty, all your dining needs will be met with grace and style. It's awesome to watch this staff in action.  The prime rib dinner includes potatoes and their famous \"spinning bowl salad.\" It's made tableside, too, and again, with a skill that's fun to watch. You can also choose from a few sides (baked potato, asparagus, creamed spinach, peas or corn, THAT'S IT) but be advised, those do cost $6 to $8 extra per portion (they're served from the cart, too). But since your prime rib will cost you from $35 to $55 (depending on cut), that $6 suddenly doesn't look too expensive ;)   My uncle got the Rib Eye steak ($42 for 10oz boneless, $50 for 16 oz plus bone) it was perfectly cooked and delicious, but my feeling is $50 is a lot for a steak, even if it is a really good one. However, my uncle thought every bite was worth every penny.   What I really appreciated was they have a few fish and vegetarian choices here, too. Three, to be exact. You can have the Fish of the Day, Lobster, or the Eggplant Lasagna. True, that's not many choices, but it might be enough to keep everyone in your group happy.   There are two appetizers available: a jumbo shrimp cocktail ($14) and a sizzling skillet of butter & garlic mushrooms ($8) We had them both since our group was large and there was plenty to share all around. The flavors were strong, simple and good. I really, really recommend the mushrooms; the sauce is lovely for dipping bread.   If I have a tiny complaint it's that all the food was really pushing the edge of saltiness and greasiness, but I am fully well aware that's the joy of this style of old-school cooking - there's a lot of butter and salt in everything but the water, and that's just how it is. It's something a health conscious person can overlook for one meal, but one might not want to eat here too often, simply to avoid an unexpected heart attack if nothing else. This is definitely a \"special occasion place\" both for the wallet and the health.  So if you find yourself in Las Vegas and you want to go have a really nice, non-casino piece of prime rib, Lawry's is your joint. Oh, and there will be a lot of Lawry's seasoning salt on the table, too. Not that you'll need it.",

I highly recommend coming here!   The decor here is nice and elegant. Great service. Made a reservation for lunch, came in, and was quickly seated.   Our party of 3 ordered the Lawry's cut prime rib with mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and creamed corn, 1 lunch special of BBQ beef sandwich with spinning bowl salad, and 1 prime rib sandwich.   Instead of a meat cart brought to your table during dinner time, you take your order up to the carver's station. The carver for our prime rib is such a nice guy. He was efficient with the knives and also super friendly.   Our lunch was amazing. The prime rib is tender and flavorful. Mashed potatoes and creamed corn is as good as I remembered. The BBQ beef sandwich is really tasty. It is nice and tender, has just the right amount of bbq sauce and wasn't salty at all. This is the first time I've tried their sandwiches. They are really good.   Service is good, our server is very friendly but seemed a bit overwhelmed and busy.  Would I come here again? Heck yeah!",

The food is good but fair warning, it is extremely rich, buttery and decadent. I suppose it's not every day that you dine at a place like this so my arteries will forgive me this once for my meal. It's fine dining so the pace is leisurely but the timing of the dishes arriving didn't leave me starving. Had a lovely meal but it definitely impacts the wallet.",

    "text": "I've only been here for lunch - three times to be precise - and I'm just not as impressed as y'all.  For lunch, they have this strange buffet service for everything except salads.  Counterintuitive, I know.  Usually they don't have anyone at the front desk to seat you, which is awkward.  Just go into the dining room and someone will figure out that you are there eventually.  If you want a sandwich, you need to get your lazy ass up, order from the guy with the chef's hat behind the sneeze guard, wait until he dishes out your food, go to another station to get your condiments, and walk your food back to your own damn table. Given the fact that the servers only have to fetch salads and drinks, you'd think the service would be excellent.  But unfortunately that's not the case.    Drink refills tend to be hard to come by.  So much that when they drop off your drink, they'll give you a little carafe of extra soda, ice tea, whatever you ordered.  Because they ain't coming back.  If they gave you the wrong drink while you were off waiting in line for someone to make your sandwich, good luck getting it fixed.  It's also hard to get the check for some reason.  But the servers look really busy and there are a lot of them so they must be doing something.  I can never figure out what.  It's really hard to get their attention.  And never come on Administrative Assistant's Day or Bosses' Day or any of those made up holidays because it only gets worse with all the offices around this restaurant.  We loves us some fake holidays.  The sandwiches are pretty good and this is the only place in town that I know of that you can get a full turkey dinner for lunch anytime of the year.  It costs $24 but, still, it's nice to have the option.  The food is pretty decent but, in my experience, the service falls short, at least during lunch.",

Have been coming to Lawry's 30+ years ever since I was a little kid and it has always been an outstanding meal each and every time. There is literally no better place for prime rib, Lawry's wrote the book on this! The service is always spectacular, the atmosphere is nice, and the food (the most important part) is always exceptional. From the spinning salad to their amazing beef to all the wonderful sides, everything at Lawry's is always spectacular. I look forward to going there whenever I am in the area and I recommend it whole hardheartedly to everyone I know who is a fan of prime rib! It has been around this long for a reason, and they are the best when it comes to prime rib! Even the Las Vegas location is as good as the original location that started long ago in Los Angeles. Always nice to know it is an option when I'm in Vegas!",

Although out waitress seemed fake and unenthusiastic while working, the rest of the service was great! They started us off with a spinning salad, which I was a big fan of because of the sour dough croutons. My boyfriend had the thick cut of prime rib that came with the bone (only because I wanted the bone portion) and I had a thin slice, medium rare with 1 lobster tail along with creamed corn and creamed spinach, (I was going all out). I personally don't really eat prime rib to begin with, but my first bite into my slice was amazing. It was just so juicy and delicious, I can't even describe it. The bone off of my bfs prime rib was probably the best part. I felt like a barbarian eating it with my hands getting all the meat off. What can I say, i have no shame! I loved the creamed corn, you just can't go wrong with creamed corn. The creamed spinach was okay to me, only because of the texture and realizing that I didn't like spinach to begin with, haha.   For dessert, we couldn't decide on what to share so we just ordered creme brulee and the sticky toffee. The sticky toffee was the amazing as well! It came with vanilla ice cream which paired perfectly with it. I didn't like the creme brulee only because I was too obsessed with the sticky toffee and the fact that it was a level 7 sweet compared to the creme brulee which was like a level 3 sweet. I obviously liked the sweeter dish. Overall, the price was actually pretty cheap. We really thought our dinner would be over 200$ but it was about 130 which was awesome. I will definitely be coming back here!!",

Our friend was able to book the private room and we had a selected menu. The menu consisted of salmon dish, chicken dish, and of course, PRIME RIB! All of us went for the prime rib special.  We started off with some drinks. I had the Moscow Mule, which did not come in the classic copper mug. It also had too much ice, which diluted the drink. Oh and one of my dining mates went to steal some potato chips from the bar, which were amazing! Our server noticed us going back and forth and just brought us a bowl!  We then started off with a salad, which is pretty standard and good. Then the main course prime rib! Got the medium rare and it was like butter melting in my mouth. The horseradish was wonderful spicy addition to prime rib. For sides, I got the creamed spinach and my boyfriend got creamed corn. The spinach was good, but the cream corn was WAAAAAY BETTER! I still have creamed corn dreams.  Overall, Lawry's has captured my interest and waiting to go back for my creamed corn and the melt-in-your-mouth prime rib.",

It's a very high end, posh, elegant dining establishment. They bring the prime rib carving station right to the table.  The prime rib was very flavorful. The Beef Wellington was superb.  Mashed potatoes and gravy that I just could not stop eating. Asparagus with hollandaise sauce. And a skillet of mushroom. Everything was delicious.   Very pricey though but in my opinion worth it. They even have valet parking.   Loved it!!",

    "text": "Our first time at Lawry's The Prime Rib.  If you've never been here's a secret: Get off the strip and go for lunch! You'll get an abridged version of the dinner experience for a fraction of the price.  Three of us decided that this would be better than a lunch buffet and we were looking forward to trying here after we'd been to Gallagher's for dinner on Sunday night.  First: The dress code does not apply during the lunch service but it is \"upscale\" so at least aim to wear a clean t-shirt. I wore a tank top and really felt severely underdressed for the lunch service. My Bad.  Second: Skip a salad and go for an appetizer. We ordered the fresh heirloom tomato and Mozzarella. It came drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. The Mozzarella was fresh and salty contrasting greatly with the sweet of the tomato and the balsamic. It was perfect to split between the three of us.  Third: Instead of the cart coming to you, you go to the cart! You approach the carver and inform him of what you would like.  We all ordered the luncheon cut (for smaller appetites). The creamed spinach was great and so was the creamed the corn-- It was all perfect. A few lumps in my mashed potatoes but I like mine lumpy so no complaints here. The gravy was smooth and tasted great. The aus jus was served directly over the prime rib, no cups or saucers here. Plus you get a nice, light and crispy Yorkshire pudding as well instead of a dense yeasty roll.  The prime rib itself was ordered medium-rare and everyone got a piece that was perfect. They give you butter knives because the prime rib is not tough and does truly almost cut like butter. You don't really need anything else to go with it. Just the juice and aus jus. I used only a small helping of the horseradish just for taste. They bring two kinds of horseradish. Spicy and Whipped. I wasn't a fan of the whipped as it wasn't spicy enough for me but the spicy was as perfect as it gets.  Additionally we were celebrating an anniversary and a birthday and were surprised with a small bundt spice cake with apple marmalade, creme fraiche, and raspberry drizzle with a candle. Somehow the three of us plowed through these two delicious desserts. I absolutely thought the apple marmalade was to die for and along with the spice cake, this was a fine dessert.  Definitely DO take the time to go off strip and go here!  Take the Deuce or SDX and get off at the Caesars/Flamingo/Harrahs. Walk down to Flamingo street and head Eastbound. There will be a bus stop on the south side of the street, east of the pedestrian bridge. Hop on the 202 and then Get off at Flamingo & Koval or Flamingo & Tuscany and it's a short walk to Lawry's The Prime Rib.",

She was AMAZING and unforgettable . We had a 10 year old and a 6 year old and she couldn't be more accommodating! They don't really have kids menus but she said she could do a \"kid style\" cut which was PERFECT for our 10 year old. We requested just a side of the orzo for the 6 year old and of course she made it happen. She always asked if the 6 year old had enough. Of course she was attentive and amazing to everyone else at the table as well. Whenever we come back to Vegas I would want to come back just for her . The food was great too as expected but her service made the dinner!",

    "text": "Review for second experience only.  I had such an amazing experience at Lawry's the first time I was there that I had to reserve to dine again for my birthday this past weekend. The second time around was not as satisfying as the first.  What went wrong?  - the bread was cold - the waitor did not informed the party about added charges beforehand - ordered medium rare prime rib, but prime rib was nearly cooked and chewy. I only had 4 bites and was immediately sad that it did not taste like the first time around. - I was in love with the salad, but didn't taste as good as the first time - it felt like the waitor was in a rush  Split charge is $15... Seriously? I come in a high end-high end restaurant, expecting to pay good money for good food but there were unnecessary charges. $15 to cut a piece of meat and put it on another plate is unreasonable. I could have done it myself. Secondly, the portions are big and could be fit for two people... But my party was charged $8 per plate for a measly salad.  It was my birthday, but was also charges $8 for dessert. I'm not saying that it should be complimentary but as a known high-end restaurant, you want to accommodate to your customer's satisfaction so that they can come back and spend more.  So basically.. 3 split charges.. $15 each coming out to $45, plus the two salad plates $16, and the cheesecake $8. Coming total to $69 in charges (almost 1/3 of our bill). I was so disappointed that I am not sure if I want to come back. The bill was $306, but tipped the waitor $35 because I thought it was nice ENOUGH. It would have been more if there weren't so many added charges.  Comparing this to other high-end prime rib/steakhouses... Lawry's loses to Flemings, Ruth Chris and Morton's by miles. As a high-end restaurant, added charges should not be one of the concerns - makes the customers feel like you are more about making that extra money, rather than making them happy.  Needless to say, birthday dinner was a big disapppointment.",

BEST DECISION ever! My friend ordered the lobster trio. Now don't get my wrong the lobster was like butter..... My rib eye tho.. was HITTIN. Needless to say my friend ate half of my ribeye and we shared the lobster. Oh wait, I forgot to talk about the spinning salad... Total yumminess...minus the beets. Since I don't particularly care for beets after eating half the salad it was prominent.   Overall the ambiance and experience was unmatched. It's pretty pricey.. Wallet beware... For the large ribeye, lobster trio, side of bacon mashed potatoes a glass of prosecco and lemonade was $150. Which included a $20 tip.  ENJOY!",

They seated the 5 of us in a circular booth and pulled out the table so we could walk in and sit, so much easier than scooting in.  We were hoping they had a special going on where it included 2 prime ribs, a side and dessert but it wasn't available, everything was ala carte.  The server was very friendly. They came by with the prime rib cart and served it exactly to the temperature we wanted it. The prime rib was actually too big for the plate and then there was a side of mashed potatoes included. There was no room on the plate for the Yorkshire pudding. The prime rib was so tender. We were wondering why they didn't bring out steak knives but the butter knife was all that was needed.  We were celebrating a birthday and they brought out a berry bundt cake with a candle. It was a very nice dinner. The bill was a little pricey but well worth it. We even had a few bones to take home to the dog.",

Just the right amount of everything, and the little touches of adding the tomatoes individually...wow.  Then the carving comes.  I love those carts.  The cart opens and it is filled with lovely, succulent, awesome prime rib.  And while we love the cow sourced portion of the meal, the creamed corn is so amazing, I could have just that for dinner.  The Yorkshire pudding is delectable, and we had sundaes (which are really, really awesome) and creme broule.  Ohhhhh It was all so wonderful, I can't think up words to describe it all.  To add to this, the service is ALWAYS always perfect--never hovering, interrupting your conversation, always there when you need them.  Carolyn, the hostess, is wonderful and always has a smile for you.  I wish I could come more often.  I miss Lawry's....",

The main attraction is of course the prime rib and they do a an exceptionally good job with it.   We prefer the English Cut because the slices of prime rib are nice and thin. Their salad and sides are also very good. And, their Yorkshire pudding is good, bready compliment that is good for soaking up the gravy and au jus.   As a side note, the art deco style of the Las Vegas location is fun if not a bit quirky. I prefer the Beverly Hills location with what I like to call the pilgrim decor. There is something very old school about that I just love.",

That big hunk of beef drenched in au jus on a plate entirely too small for it and your sides.  The prime rib; very well trimmed with almost no external fat on the rib cap, extremely tender and juicy with great beefy flavor that can only come from slow roasting a large cut of meat on the bone.  The Lawry cut, IMHO is the perfect way to enjoy.  Boneless, thick cut; ahhhh.  A bone in cut is available for the real carnivore.  The sides are classics.  Creamed spinach; just as disgustingly colored as I remember and the creamed corn with its odd consistency are just the way they should be.  Full of flavor.  Full of nostalgia.  Service is unpretentious and quick.  Good prices.  Very weak wine \"list\".  Its all good, just order a gimlet or an old fashioned and the nostalgia is complete.  Recommended.",

    "text": "This was my first time to this restaurant.  I heard great things about this place from others who have been.  We went to take my mom for her birthday which also happened to be Mother's Day.  So a special dinner for me too!  The valet service was great especially with a little one.  We didn't have to walk through a parking lot with him.   Our waitress was Ms. Taylor.  From the moment she came to our table and started to tell us about the restaurant we could tell she would be a great waitress.  She engaged in a lot of conversation with my son.  Of course he's only 19 months and can't talk much with her.  But she kept coming back to check on him.  She brought him some peas (yes he ate it), corn and croutons.  Dinner was delicious.  My first time having Yorkshire Pudding.  Not what I expected.  But everything was great.  If only I was able to have a glass of wine...    At the end of the meal, my mom got a special cake.  My son got a special tour of the kitchen to get him some ice cream!  He was getting a little fussy and Ms. Taylor thought that it would help him settle down a bit.  Save some room for the sticky toffee pudding/cake.  That was amazing!    I would recommend asking for Ms. Taylor as your waitress.  Especially if you have kids with you.  She was amazing and made our dinner so much more enjoyable.  You can really tell she loved her job.",

    "text": "Last month, our party of 7 came here to celebrate a birthday.  We arrived and seated promptly for our 7pm Saturday reservations.  The prime rib was amazing and comparable to the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco.   THE PROCESS: *Menus are given to each person - you've given about 10 minutes to look it over *Waitress comes back to check if anyone will not be having prime rib (we each had the prime rib) *5-10 minutes later, the prime rib cart comes to the table and the waitress explains each cut *The guy at the cart carves your slice right there  MY CUT: *California Cut - Perfect!  This is the smallest slice but it was enough for me and I still had a bit left over.  The prime rib was cooked to a perfect medium rare, tender, and had great marbling towards the outside.  YOUR PRIME RIB DINNER INCLUDES *Salad - Yum!  The waitress spins the salad right at your table.  The salad includes lettuce, egg, the to die for croutons, and beets.  *Mashed Potatoes and Gravy - Yum!  The mashed potatoes were velvety smooth! *Yorkshire Pudding - YUMMY!  It's cooked on a small pan and brought directly to your table.  Yorkshire pudding has always been my favorite part of the meal (what can I say, I'm not really a meat eater).  SERVICE: Our waitress was nice and informative.  She came by every so often to check on us to see if we needed anything.  The manager was extremely nice.  We had an incident with the champagne we brought - while the waitress uncorked it, the cork popped off, champagne spewed out of the bottle and onto my friend's dress.  The manager came over to make sure she was okay and said they'd take care of her dry cleaning.  OTHER NOTES: *Corkage Fee: $25 for wine or champagne (no hard liquor allowed) *Located close by the strip - about a $13 cab ride from Treasure Island *The sides are enough to share between 2-3 people",

    "text": "Read numerous Yelp reviews singing praises for Lawry's lunch special and their salad bar.   First impression: the place was a ghost town. Totally empty. Not a good sign.  The \"salad bar\" was, no joke, 2' x 3'. If you're making a movie and you need a miniature version of a real salad bar, come here. I told my wife I thought I was being punk'd.   The \"lunch special\" was a BBQ sandwich for $10. It was God horrible. Couldn't eat it. The meat was very dry and rubbery and black on the outside. The BBQ sauce helped lube it up but didn't change the fact that it was inedible.  I returned that for the Prime Rib Sandwich for $16. MUCH better. The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and tasty. The au jus was also excellent. But - $16? For a sandwich? Off a lunch menu?   So, three sandwiches, a salad (which my wife enjoyed), and some iced teas - including tip = $72!   Yep. Punk'd.",

    "text": "On what was SUPPOSED to be the happiest day of my brother and my new sister in law's lives, it was ruined by Lawry's horrible sound system. Yes, I know that may sound like such a small thing to claim it ruined their day, but think about it, EVERYONE looks forward to celebrating the new marriage with the reception following right? That's the point of having a reception. As my gift to the couple, I paid for an expensive comedian to MC their reception. I paid for this person's flight and hotel as well. Once I heard him on the mic asking for ppl to be seated for the grand entrance, I was concerned because everyone in the back could not hear him and the ppl that could hear, it was a muffle. This was unacceptable considering we gave this MC a 30 minute slot to do his act, not to mention the upcoming speeches and a special number by the groom's son. When the dj and myself asked the staff for help with their sound, there was NO ONE on hand from Lawry's that was capable in fixing the situation. Is it not common sense that when your establishment is hosting an event such as a wedding that you would have an TECH/SOUND person on hand to assist?! When we asked for such a person, they had NO ONE. This is simply and truly UNACCEPTABLE. The groom's son had to replay their special number to the bride and groom later that night in private just so that could hear how it was SUPPOSED to sound. I had to ask the MC/comedian to really project his voice because we could rely on the mic for him to be heard. The dj only brought a couple of small speakers just as back up because of the fact that Lawry's was so adamant on the dj using their sound system. If we had known how crappy their sound system was, I would have been adamant with dj in bring the speakers he would normally bring!! I myself ended up not being to eat at all because I was too busy doing damage control so that my brother and his new wife could have the reception that they deserved all because Lawry's effed up. Thanks Lawry's, you ruined the experience and the reception for the couple and everyone who came to celebrate with them. You suck.",

    "text": "My dining experience with Lawry's The Prime Rib is part of a party hosted by my cousin. Our menu was a 6-course event with endless wine that flowed like water (crab cake and shrimp appetizers, salad, sorbet, cheese tray and truffle dessert) with the option to choose prime rib, salmon or lobster--my choice of course was prime rib! The dinner entree was served with Yorkshire pudding (which the server forgot to include but thankfully my niece gave me hers), mashed potatoes with gravy and choice of buttered peas, creamed spinach or creamed corn.  The appetizers, IMHO, was the highlight of the meal: the crab cake is perfectly made, lumpy with chunks of crab, flavorful and so delicious that I wished there were more. The shrimp cocktail, comprised of two oversized plump shrimps, was also excellent.  The prime rib was carved to order (directly from a rolling cart roaster), it is thick cut, juicy and heftily portioned at 16 oz. ('gads!). The steak was perfectly cooked, medium was my preferred choice, with just enough marbling. My only wish was that the meat should have been seasoned more (although Lawry's seasoned salt wasn't too far away to fix this), otherwise it was a good steak and ranks up there with the best.  The service is one of the best, only matched by the elegant art deco theme of the location. Overall, I would say Lawry's provided one of the best dining experiences, and being a local in Vegas, that says a lot.",

They sat us in tiny booth which made it kind of uncomfortable to for us. We started with a glass of their Cabernet. Then they brought their famous spinning salad. The salad was ok. Then we both got the prime rib with mash potatoes and creamed spinach. My boyfriend upgraded for a bigger cut than the 8 oz. the prime rib was soooo good and tender. They also served it with Yorkshire pudding, to me it just tasted like bread. I guess it supposed to soak up the juices. The two sides were just ok, nothing really to complain about. Except I don't like that they put the sides with prime rib and au jus. Then came the dessert we both got creme brulee with hot tea. They bring out such a cute setting for your tea and also bring you a display case for which tea you would like. The creme brulee was a little burnt and I could've done with out the berries they put on top.   Service was good and the prime rib  was really good.",

    "text": "Lawry's was pretty much the default restaurant option for almost all my friend's bachelor party weekends in Vegas.  But since most are now married, I haven't been back to dine here in a few years. Then I got a call from my friend who was visiting Vegas with his wife, and he wanted prime rib for dinner and asking for recommendations, and eventually we found our way here last night.  The parking lot was nearly empty when we arrived at around 5:30pm, but that is hardly an indication of the restaurant's popularity, as a large portion of the restaurant's guests arrive via taxi.  After a promise of being seated within 15 minutes, we were lead to a booth table in one of the side rooms (near the entrance to the kitchen) in about 5 minutes.  In the past I am used to being seated with at least 20-30 guys in a long line of tables, but I was pleasantly surprised by the table being pulled out for ease of seating.  If they only do that when we are ready to leave, after a big hearty meal.  Anyway, the quality and taste of the prime rib at Lawry's is still what I remembered.  My favorite part of the meal is still the \"Original Bowl of Spinning Salad\" that they served (part of the prime rib dinners and seafood entrees), in fact I will eat just that if it is AYCE.  That said, the Lawry's Cut prime rib that I ordered was tasty and juicy, and good for the price charged for such a popular dining spot.  The service is very professional and friendly. And if you are looking for something that is other than the myriad of AYCE/Buffet options here in Las Vegas, consider giving Lawry's a try.  It is not too far from the Strip, and all the cabbies know where it is located.  However, I am not sure about their vegetarian options (except as side items to the entree: Fresh Asparagus, Sizzling Skillet of Mushrooms, Creamed Spinach, Creamed Corn, and Buttered Peas and Lawry's Baked Idaho Potato - if you hold the bacon) , as the menu is mostly about their prime rib, or alternatives that include lobster, rib eye steak, or fresh fish.  Also they have a courtesy phone for calling any local Las vegas numbers (located right outside the restroom), which I thought is nice, but with just about everyone having a cell phone nowadays, I doubt it gets used much.  But I supposed it can come in handy if you want to play a prank on your friends or frienemy, and willing to make the effort to make that drive out to the restaurant.  Oh yeah, my friends ordered some drinks while we were waiting, and he said the bartender there makes really good bloody mary.  And if you don't live near a Lawry's and want to satisfy your craving for Lawry's food, they have posted the recipes for you to try and make it at home.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lawrysonline.com%2Ftheprimerib_lasvegas_recipes.asp&s=181fa7776b823c5e3edbd524aaff8da90cb0ad63ff9846a0040697487aeec03d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lawrysonline.com/theprim...</a>  4 stars.",

It's near the Howard Hughes business area so there's always a ton of businessmen and women having lunch here on weekdays.  With this in mind, we decided to meet at 11:30 am (opening time) to beat the lunch rush.  I went up to the chef and ordered a BBQ Beef Sandwich ($12), Cup of Chili ($5), and an Iced Tea ($3).  The BBQ Beef Sandwich was very good.  The Beef was juicy and the BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and not too sweet....just the way I like it.  The one negative for me was the amount of Sauce, I would have preferred less Sauce.....you can't control the amount of Sauce though, it's served that way.  The Chili was amazing!  It is easily the best Chili I've ever had.  It's not for Vegetarians though.....there's Beef in the Chili.  The combination of ingredients was perfect....I wish I knew what was in it!  It also had a slight spicy kick to it too.  The atmosphere is upscale and professional, perfect for our lunch meeting.  Overall, it was a great experience.  Hint - If you want to try their amazing Prime Rib but don't want to pay the Dinner prices, come for lunch and get the Lunch Cut Prime Rib, which was $20 I believe.  Did I get Value for my money?  Yes. Will I return?  Absolutely.",

    "text": "I have been missing out.  I can't believe I'm already a  half-way point in my life and I've just discovered Lawry's.  The  pictures of prime rib never appealed to me.   I foolishly thought that ideal steak should be sizzling with nice grill marks.   I'm not much of a steak eater, but I do appreciate a good steak now and then.     First of all, the prime rib at Lawry's is juicy, flavorful and strangely don't give you that disgusting, heavy, greasy feeling  at the end.  It was very easy on my stomach.  I also love the fact that you can choose the thickness of your cut.   They also offer the best sides!  I loved the spinning salad, especially the spinning part.  I'm still dreaming about the Yorkshire pudding.  I felt like a little kid watching the chef prepare the meal table side.  I was totally amused and in awe.   I can't believe they don't have Lawry's here in the east coast!   They have to open one in NYC.  I want to go back to Vegas just for Lawry's.  Perhaps it's a good thing that Lawry's isn't in NY because it would seriously mess with my cholesterol level..",

    "text": "I like eating affordable prime rib while being wine and dined like I'm the most important person there. Every server I get here always goes above and beyond. You can tell that they enjoy their job here and they're not forced to put on this act to just get tips. My favorite server here is Ms. Pleasant, and she's such a pleasure to have.   My most recent visit was to celebrate my 1 year engagement with my fiance. I wish we could have put it off because we were both recovering from being sick and my taste buds were not cooperating with me. However, being a part of the Lawry's VIP diners club, I did not want to waste my free $50 voucher as it would expire the following day.   So in the end, I had to confess to Ms. Pleasant that I didn't stop eating because I was full, but because I couldn't taste anything. She went out of her way to comp a couple of side dishes to bring home as well as a little anniversary cake...that my fiance could eat -_-. The food is always exceptional and the service always exceeds any expectations I have. I always want to try other steakhouses but I always find myself back here, especially around when Three Square hosts restaurant week.",

    "text": "Well, I guess it could have been worse.  We have our go-to steak houses, and we had yet to try Lawry's.  When we got a gift card for Christmas, we decided to make the hour-long round-trip commute to check it out with high expectations, and were incredibly disappointed.  Service: The guys working the valet and front door were nice when we got there, but they were too busy talking to say anything to us or grab the door when we left.  I have no problem holding my own door, but they set a high standard upon arrival.  The folks at the host/hostess station were very friendly, hospitable, and helpful, and the servers running the carving station were the best.  Also, our water was always filled, which was nice.  That's the good news.  On the other hand, the hostess that sat us moved the table out so we could sit, and she shoved it so far into us once we were seated, we couldn't move and had to push the table out.  Then the waitress at this nice restaurant began her introduction by making some negative comment about her uniform...weird start.    The waitress only got worse from there.  With a dietary restriction, I asked if vegetables could be substituted.  She told us there were no substitutions, and when I even expressed my willingness to pay the difference between what came with the prime rib - potatoes and what my wife reported was less-than-desirable Yorkshire Pudding - and either a mushroom or asparagus side, the waitress turned her head and said, \"sorry, I don't make the rules.\"  Not only was it off-putting that they wouldn't substitute cheap vegetables when we're paying $150+ for dinner, the server's rudeness was about the point I lost interest.  Food: The cocktail shrimp for $17 was way over-priced.  The 5 shrimp were unremarkable, and the cocktail sauce was so spicy it made us both choke, though the waitress failed to warn us how much horseradish they put in.  Seems like something they'd tell you in advance.  And despite her suggestion we add one more shrimp on to leave 3 for each of us, we declined to pay the extra $3 for one shrimp; wise choice in hindsight.  The salad dressing was good, and the salad was small but one of the highlights.  They encourage you to add their seasoned pepper, likely to up-sell you on buying a jar.  Other than the \"meh\" potatoes and Yorkshire Pudding, the prime rib was good, but not worth the hype that this place gets.  I had the Lawry Cut (thick cut) and my wife had the English Cut (3 thin slices).  I've had better prime rib at a few other steak houses in town for comparable or better prices.  The horseradish came in whipped and pure varieties, and even though the whipped was good, I encourage you to use it sparingly because they'll never ask if you'd like more if you run out.  My wife seemed to like her dessert, but she loves just about any dessert, so that's not saying much.  All in all, I feel like we paid about $150 for a $40 downtown-casino-quality experience.  I won't be coming back to Lawry's.",

With another couple we all ordered the same thing which is the Lawry prime rib popular cut. You want a baked potato instead of mashed, extra; you want the bone to be included, extra. All right other restaurants do these ridiculous up charges. When the main dish arrived we all compared prime ribs. Mine was appreciably larger than my husband's. I mean 50% larger and 50% thicker. Our companions had the same issue. We complained and were brought Additional slices. The meat was OK. Maybe it was the inexperience of the carver, maybe the waiter who should have taken note of it. When you're paying these type of prices things should be perfect.",

Well this location here in Vegas did not disappoint either. Food was delicious, service was on point, and did I mention complimentary valet parking?! I'm used to the BH location which charges for parking I believe like 8$? Not sure on the exact price (obviously it's always courteous to tip the valet guys). California cut is always my go to menu item so that's exactly what I ordered. The cut had such a perfect texture, flavor, and was like heaven in my mouth. My two favorite sides (that are at an extra cost) are the cream of spinach and cream of corn. Totally worth the extra money for those. My favorite aspect about this restaurant is how the Prime Rib is cut at the table side. The man cleaning up the dishes/filling waters was also great! My cup was never empty he made sure that I always had enough water throughout my meal and cleared out any excess plates. My server was amazing as well, believe his name was Drew? This place is definitely worth the money, I love it.",

Being known for their prime rib, I obviously ordered it and it did not disappoint being quite a tasty piece of beef albeit being extraordinarily pricey. It's like you can take most of the dishes you find elsewhere and multiply the price by three.  There seems to be quite a bit of hidden costs. For instance, when served with the prime rib, the server would ask whether you would like some creamed spinach or corn without me even thinking that would be an added cost. The bill can add up fairly quickly.   The prime rib entree came with house salad which tasted just like a typical salad, mashed potatoes, and a very small portion/slice of the Yorkshire pudding. Restaurant seems rather stingy on various fronts.  The service was just okay, nothing spectacular.",

We all know the name Lawry from spices and powder gravy. Lawry's have a long family history. It's interesting to read about them.   I reserved through open table on their website which was painless. You can self park or do the complimentary valet.   The restaurant is huge. You can have real big parties here. We were lucky and sat at big shell like booth where they pull the table out to sit.   The servers here use their last name which I thought was formal and proper. This place is very classy and traditional in good way.   If you order prime rib, the cutter and your server will come to you with the big silver wagon which by the way costs as much as your vehicle.  The prime rib comes with mash potatoes, creamed corn and creamed spinach. You also get house salad made at your table. They bring you real hot horseradish and whipped horseradish.   The neatest thing was four carol singers visited each table and sung holiday songs. What an experience!!! They sang so pretty. I will remember this night forever. The whole experience of good food and service was so nice!",

Made reservations, and still had to wait a while to be seated. We had a double date dinner for New Year's Eve. My husband and I got our dinners first (it was the prime rib from the cart), and the other couples food came out so much later because they got grilled steak... we felt rude to eat without them. We waited for a while until they told us to just eat so our food was still hot. Wished the servers waited to give us our food until theirs was done, since it can be wheeled to our table. My friend ordered a beer to go with his dinner, and he didn't receive it until he was done eating.",

I got the California cut and my husband got the Lawry cut!  I think we both could've shared the Lawry cut because it was huge!  Took it home and it tasted just as good the next day!

Their spinning salad and potato were good, nothing special, but the fact that you get a salad and potato with your steak is pretty good, compared to other places like Ruth Chris.    I'm a sucker for really good prime rib because you just can't duplicate it at home.  I got one of the larger bone in cuts,  which was absolutely amazing.  So juicy and flavorful.  Everyone who got the normal cuts seemed to enjoy theirs.  A couple of my friends got end cuts, which I'm not a fan of, and they both said the ends were some of the best steaks they ever had.  They also have a \"ribeye\" which is a cut of prime rib that is then cooked like a steak.  Had a bite of that and have to say I may have a tough decision next time I am there.  Overall it was a great dinner, and I will be back.",

The prime rib was really good, the lobster tail was really tasty, my fiance was to full to finish hers which I did not mind :)  They did a great job with our group, and we had some pretty picky eaters. They divided up the bill in the way we requested...

The restaurant is dimly lit for ambience but beautifully decorated and a very romantic place to have dinner or a very upscale place to have a business dinner. The waitresses dress in vintage serving attire (such as a servant of the rich would wear, complete with white caps, cuffs, and aprons. With your meal, you are first served the spinning salad bowl which the waitress brings, adds the dressing and seasonings to, and spins in front of you, then serves. The prime rib main course is served by a chef/carver (complete with vintage chef's attire including the tall cap) who arrives pulling a huge silver cart and cuts your meat in front of you, then serves it.  Along with your meal you get Yorkshire Pudding (which is to die for) and choices of Lawry's own seasonings. If you have room for dessert after all that, you have a choice of many great items such as the chocolate souffle. We went there on Valentine's Day and received jars of chocolate topping to take home. We also joined the Lawry's club and get gift certificates regularly in the mail. This is such a superb place to have a fancy dinner.",

They have different cuts of meat which just means they have differnent sizes.  I got the Lawry's cut which is a step below the Jim Brady cut.  The Jim Brady cut is the biggest and it's huge.  I don't know how one person could eat that by him/herself.  The meal comes with Salad (which is freshly spun at your table), Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, and some awesome whipped horseradish.

Still the best prime rib around anywhere.  I've even copied their creamed corn recipe which is probably the only reason why people even bother to talk to me.  The ambiance at this branch seems a little cozier and more romantic than the one in Socal.  The icing on the whole experience was that the meal was expensed.  *sigh*",

    "text": "I have loved Lawry's ever since my first time in Beverly Hills. Luckily the one in Las Vegas is equally good.  I always order the California cut with a side of creamed corn. It comes with the spinning bowl salad, yorkshire pudding, and mashed potatoes with gravy. I wish I had enough stomach space to eat an appetizer. I love their salad and I normally don't think salad is that great. Both their creamed corn and their mushroom side dishes are delicious.   Their service was very good and our waitress was very nice and attentive. She very patiently explained all the steps of our meal and what each item on the table was used for. She was very nice and helped us pick a wine to go with our meal. Their wine line is also very reasonably priced.   The only reason why Lawry's gets four stars instead of five is because I wish they served their food on hot plates. My prime rib got cold after the first few bites because I was busy eating everything that came with my meal.",

    "text": "Our neighbors got us hooked on this place. The first time I went, I dutifully ordered the prime rib and it was good. I order my steaks rare and it's hard to find a really nice rare piece of prime rib that tickles my fancy, but with the atomic horseradish I was quite satisfied. The Yorkshire pudding is good for soaking up the steak juices, but other than that not very flavorful (which might be normal for this dish, as I have not had it anywhere else.) The creamed spinach side was wonderful! We also had the creamed corn, which was also quite good. The second time (and every time since) I ordered the rib eye. Let me just say that this will not disappoint! It is grilled over rosemary sprigs and is infused with it's flavor. The outside of the steak is perfectly crisp and the inside is nice and tender (as well as blood rare like I order it.) The rib eye comes with scalloped potatoes which are heavenly. The spinning salad that comes with all of the dishes is quite tasty although my husband doesn't like the beets in it.   The service is another HUGE plus for this restaurant. The hostess is always warm and friendly, and now remembers us by name. The wait staff is always attentive and willing to share a laugh and a story or two.",

    "text": "It's like you're stepping back in time, for better or worse.  The plus side is that the prime rib is very, very good and a throwback - not too many places serve it anymore with any level of success.  Lawry's hits a solid triple, though not in the home run status that is SF's House of Prime Rib.  Also scoring highly on the wayback meter is the Yorkshire pudding - I can't remember the last time I had a popover, but I will make sure I don't wait as long in the future for my next one!  Unfortunately, much else of what we ordered missed the mark.  In particular, the service.  Our waitress was a complete space shot, going off on random tangents about how she ended up in Vegas (unprompted), how she was spacy because she had allergies (one would think allergies would be low in a desert city...) and completely forgetting orders altogether.  She also failed to mention the size of the side orders - we had 12 people in our party and we ordered probably 8 sides, which was about 4 too many!  They are HUGE!  Not to mention your prime rib comes with plenty of mashed potatoes, corn, creamed spinach and peas, which, to my own fault, I did not notice when reading the menu.  For a place off the Strip, I feel like you need to really stand out to survive, and Lawry's was pretty forgettable.  Well, not quite - with the right service and perhaps some modernization of classic dishes, it could be a real destination.  Until that happens though, I'll stick to the slightly pricier but much more exciting cuisine on the Strip.",

The menu is simple, you just choose what kind of cut of prime rib you want (I get the beef bowl cut!) and then a couple sides to go along with it (I like the creamed corn and mashed potatoes). I would advise against the lobster tail, since it's rather small, but if you need more to get you full, the yorkshire pudding is a tasty addition as well as the sauteed mushrooms.",

The place was dark and not that special, The people were super nice and the four of us all had the prime rib, veggies and water. It was o.k. really how special can you make it? Isn't  that why the push the horse radish to make up for lack of taste? (luckily I killed it with the dark English gravy) Long story short I think with tip & tax we were in it for over 250 for a party of four.  I'll be happy to return if I get another gift cert (hint hint)",

Arrived and we decided to get a drink.  Cute little bar with sports on.  Love Vegas for that fact.  Ordered a Bloody Mary and WOW I must say it was the worst one I had ever had.  I was thinking oh no we have made a grave mistake.  BTW 3 drinks cost more than a reasonable house pymt.  Dinner on the other hand was fantastic.  Our server Leslie was a huge treat.  Funny cute and very engaging.  She helped make the evening awesome.  Prime Rib was out of this world.   Place is old school but you have to go.  Great food great service shitty bloody marys.  Oh well guess we cant have it all.",

    "text": "Can prime rib get any better?  Only at Lawry's...  4 Stars for prime rib.  On our last trip to Las Vegas the wife and I decided to try a real prime rib restaurant since I'm a big fan of steaks and prime rib.  From reading previous reviews I had high expectations for the service and quality of the prime rib.  I was NOT disappointed!  The ambiance of the restaurant is spot on and the service was excellent.  When they seat you they pull the table out so you don't have to squeeze and slide into your booth.  Now that's service...  We ordered the famous spinning salad which was prepared table side.  Now the star attraction...  The shiny chrome prime rib cart came around and as the gentlemen opened the cover to reveal prime rib paradise.  I couldn't resist, I wanted to order the biggest thickest cut they had.  Reality and wife kicked in and I settled for a 16oz cut, mash potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  The taste and quality of the meat was excellent.  Before we left I had to take a picture of my prime rib cart pushing hero.  He was nice and even did the hands on the hip pose with the cart cover open.  That was worth the extra 1 star!  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas!",

All sorts of earth-tones and wood lets you know that you're definitely in a steakhouse. Staff was friendly until we met our waitress.  So my friend and I come in, I'm dressed up and ready to go out that night and he's dressed in regular street clothes. We look young and already this waitress had sized us up and gave off a neutral vibe. She wasn't mean or nice. Kind of just \"meh\".  Whatever, I was there for the food anyways. We ordered the beef bowl cut which is this giant slab of meat that they feed the Rose Bowl teams every year at the Beverly Hills location. They start off with this spinning salad thing. Oooo ahhh. Anyways, the give you the yorkshire pudding, choice of potato and of course the meat.  The meat was great.  That concludes my review.",

We ordered the Lawry's cut with Lobster and also had the Stuffed Salmon.  As expected, the prime rib was awesome.  Unexpected was that for a meat place, they do fish and lobster pretty damn well.  The Stuffed Salmon was moist, tender and flavorful.  Mmmm.  We also had the sizzling mushrooms which was a mixture of button, shiitake and oyster mushrooms.  I would definitely recommend them - yummy!    Our server was Lucero and she has to be my favorite waitress in all of Las Vegas.  I wouldn't normally remember my server's name, but this lady was outstanding, excellent (insert any great word here).  She made us feel comfortable and she had us laughing the whole time we were there.  She even showed us pictures of her 6 month-old baby!  The spinning salad show and table side carving was also much appreciated.  The carver was wearing this gold medal thing and he even responded well to my comments about him winning a gold medal in the olympics.    Highly recommended and I can't wait to go back!",

The worst part of the evening belonged to  the valet parking company. The valets couldn't find the fob to my car, claimed I never gave it to them and asked me to check my pockets. I took off my jacket, checked my pants and coat pockets, knowing full well I had given it to the attendant. A pair of panicked valets said they would \"double-check\" the automobile and turned up nothing. I walked outside to my vehicle, which was locked, an action that cannot be taken without the fob. I explained this to yet another manager who claimed, \"Some cars can be locked with the fob left inside the vehicle.\" After about 30 minutes of watching confused valets run around the parking lot, I realized they were trying to open the wrong car! This is after they did the same thing to another member of our dinner party!  If you go, park your own car or take a cab.",

We had made reservations for a busy Friday night but due to circumstances out of our control - we called & let them know that we were running a half an hour late! Well Ms. Carolynn Stevenson greeted us as we again apologized for our tardiness. She immediately put us at ease, told us she would get us seated as soon as possible, and show us to the bar. We waited maybe ten minutes when we were called and seated! Our server turned out to be - in our opinion - the BEST - Mun Froilan!!!!!! If you want the most awesome dining experience then ask for him when you make your reservation!!! It is a must! He makes you feel as if you are the one and only guests he has to please and take care of and everything he did he seemed to truly enjoy! The restaurant's decor is a 1930's-40's era which I love since the staff's attire also reflects that time period. You start off with the artisan bread (OMG - SO SO DELISH) and their famous spinning salad. The prime rib just melts in your mouth! The cuts we had were good size - Mun made sure of that! - and I had the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach which was so fabulous. The dessert cart that he wheeled out looked amazing but we couldn't fit another morsel of food in our mouths! Highly recommend this GREAT restaurant!",

We started with a shrimp cocktail, large meaty prawns in a nice spicy cocktail sauce.  We both went with prime rib too, I really enjoyed the thin cut, juicy and flavorful.  The creamed corn was much better than the creamed spinach ( HOPR is better).  Portions are huge, we could not finish.  We also tried the sticky toffee pudding but that was lackluster, not sticky or much toffee flavor.  This restaurant has many unique qualities, the waitress outfits for one and the old school decor.

For some reason...many steakhouses now do not offer prime rib on their menu....so its always a pleasure to see a restaurant that specializes in this cut of beef. we started off with cocktails(wife had a pinot grigio) and both my son and I agreed the drinks were expensive and not very potent. stay clear of the appetizers--you don't need them. the spinning bowl Caesar salad is all glitz and just truly OK. nothing special. the dinner entree is the star here. My wife got the smallest piece...the California cut....she seemed happy but for $39 I thought it was really truly small. my son and I both had the diamond jim brady cut and both agreed it was melt in your mouth tasty and delicious. the Yorkshire pudding popover is also very good....side of creamed spinach was  just average. Mashed potatoes are fine..they seem to routinely pour gravy on the potatoes..not sure why. no room for dessert. Its pretty pricey here but overall you walk away  feeling it was a positive experience. its a very attractive restaurant..parking is a breeze....service is robotic but fine...if prime rib is your thing ....you must make Lawrys a definite  las vegas stop.",

I ordered the thickest piece of prime rib i could get, it was literally 4 inches thick and about 12 inches wide!!!! The mashed potatoes were good, the mushrooms are off the chain. Youll be paying a good amount but its worth it.",

    "text": "Has anyone been to House of Prime Rib in SF??  Imagine something better than Lawry's, you can ask for SECONDS for the prime rib, sides are INCLUDED, you can have EITHER mashed potatoes or baked potato (without being charged extra $6), prices are cheaper, and service isn't focused on selling!    Our waitress was not being completely honest when I ask her if I can have the baked potato instead of the mashed potatoes.  She said yes you can and failed to tell me I had to pay $6. Her answer to my question seemed sketch so I rephrased the question and asked if substitution was possible. She finally answered the questions in a way that \"Yes, yes you can, as long as you pay for it.\" She explained it as I could substitute the mashed potatoes w/baked, as long as I pay $6... couldn't she say, \"There are no substitutions with the sides. The baked potato is considered an extra side.\"??  Once the meat cart was out, she was being attentive, or shall I say sneaky, because she kept offered the creamed corn and spinach as if it was included. It didn't help that my whole group wasn't very observant with the menu because it tells you that the sides are a la carte, which is ultimately their fault.  But perhaps our waitress could explain that all prime rib meals come with just mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding, no substitutions at all.  She had no problems reiterating other things that she wanted us to order...  apps, baked potatoes, wine, etc.  To top it off, they calculated our bill wrong.    I will never waste my money here.",

I've only been to the original in Beverly Hills but watching all the Rose Bowl teams enjoy the annual Beef Bowl on the news made me crave Lawry's even more.  I love how Lawry's has never changed.  You still receive exceptional service, delicious food and a grand experience unlike no other.  Screw those Las Vegas buffets that offer all you can eat Prime Rib for $9.99.  You will never want another slab of succulent Prime Rib carved from anywhere else but LAWRY'S famous silver cart!",

    "text": "Mmm, love me some prime rib. I was ecstatic when a friend suggested this place. Though it was off the strip and pricey, I was excited to try some of the world's famous prime rib ever. They also have a location in LA where I'm from but I've never had a chance to make it there. Anyways we arrived on time for our reservation but still had to wait like 20 minutes to be seated. Then when we arrived in the dining room, the place didn't look that full at all. What's up with that? Shouldn't they have prepared our table ahead of time? Anyways as far as prime rib, they have only 4 or 5 choices. And I already looked on the online menu and I know I wanted the Lawry's cut which is their most popular. It's 16 oz, I believe, and only like $4 more than the smaller 10 oz cut. Even if I didn't like prime rib or wasn't that hungry, the Asian in me would be like get the bigger cut because it's only $4 more and you get more bang for your buck. And each of the prime ribs entrees came with the spinning salad, mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. Everything is served tableside. The spinning salad performance is cool. And I liked the dressing on the salad - it was a little bit tangy. But the salad itself is a bit overdressed - all the leaves were drenched in the dressing. Finally came the main event - the prime rib. The carver came over to our table to cut our meat right there. Oh and waitress serves all the ladies at the table first so guys don't get offended if they pass/ignore you at first.  I got my Lawry's cut medium rare and it was perfect. So pink with the tiniest bit of red/blood and with the bone still connected to it. When I bit into it - heaven, so tender it just melts in your mouth. The put the mashed potatoes on the plate and will ask you if you want any additional sides. Sneaky because on the menu, it says they are extra but they don't mention it when offering it to you so you may get tricked like the person next to me did. She ended up getting the creamed spinach, which was an extra $6. Then after everyone is served, our waitress cut up pieces of the Yorkshire pudding to put on our plates. For anyone who's never had the pudding, it's really like a piece of a roll. Not sure how else to describe it. I was kinda dumb in that I tried to eat the meat off the bone first in an attempt to save the more delicious part for last. But I was so full by the end of the meal that it hurt to try to finish the last few pieces. I ended up leaving a small piece on my plate at the end of the meal and I despise wasting food. But I really couldn't eat anymore. I wish I had enjoyed the piece of meat rather than what was on the bone. Oh well, I know for next time. Our waitress was cool, so happy, cheerful, polite and attentive. We also ended our meal with two birthday desserts. The brought out two mini strawberry shortcakes with candles. I love dessert and strawberries but only had like 2 bites. We all shared but I think we were so stuffed, that all 11 of us couldn't even finish two small desserts. So sad. Overall, it's a really nice place to celebrate special occasions, every once in awhile.",

    "text": "Excellent fresh cooked and well seasoned prime rib (it better be for a place named for it, right?) - the sides; asparagus, creamed corn, potatoes and yorkshires are also great.  The prime rib comes in many sizes, they cut the size/taste off for you when you place your order. Nice selection of wines, and the cocktails were only $7 - in Vegas this is a screaming deal.   Fantastic old fashioned service (dressed in the original waitresses uniforms).  We were there to celebrate a birthday and our lovely server did a very nice job of wishing him a happy birthday throughout the evening and presenting a special candle lit dessert to him after dinner, nice touch.     The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because of the ambiance, the table for 2 that we were at felt like a deserted, exposed island in the middle of an ocean of huge tables - I think a table tucked along the side or corner may have been nicer.  That being said the ambiance is still nice, very traditional steakhouse type except for brighter. Reservations are a must, even with reservations we still had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. It is about a 10-15 minute walk from the strip (Paris area).  We will definitely go back when in the area, as the meal is truly fantastic.",

After a sweet ceremony, the wedding party ended up at Lawry's (which her sneaky fiance had booked a few weeks in advance) and it was the icing on a perfect night.   The staff was wonderful and so enthusiastic; the sight of a large, late-night group didn't dampen their cheerfulness at all. They were quick with the drinks, and didn't make us feel rushed or pressured at all.   The food itself is to die for. I wish I had room to finish it all. I'm not even a huge fan of red meat, but the prime rib was divine. I could probably live off their sauteed mushroom and creamed spinach dishes alone.   At the end of our meal, our waitress brought out a complimentary slice of cake for the glowing newlyweds, that was almost too pretty to eat.   Even if I never eat there again, I will always have amazing memories of Lawry's. 5 stars for food, 5 stars for service.",

She said no so, I asked to speak with the Manager.  He arrived and brought a serious attitude with him. I tried to explain our situation. Without any empathy at all he told us to, \"sit at the booth or leave\". We left.  On a second occasion my Wife took visiting relatives to this restaurant at their request. She was appalled that each person at the table was only allowed only one half of a popover. Even her request to allow the four of them another half and pay extra was met with a flat \"No\".  I am not a fan and will not try to eat here again.   There you have it. That's my opinion. Make your own choice.

    "text": "While I didn't dine at the original Lawry's, I was able to go to the Las Vegas outlet while I was there for work and it was quite near the hotel I was staying at. The outside looked like a very plain building but once inside, it's like being transported back to what I imagine Beverly Hills in the 50's would look like. Art Deco design lined the whole place and an almost empty restaurant (I went after the lunch rush) made it easy to admire everything from where I was sitting.  I started with a prawn cocktail served in a cute silver pot. There were two lemon wedges, no frou frou shredded lettuce, and a very generous amount of cocktail sauce. The prawns were huge and I tried not to eat too fast (because bad habits die hard) so I could savor my appetizer. It was easy to not have to share this.  I then got a soup of the day which happened to be cream of mushroom, my favorite! There wasn't even a toss up between soup or salad because soup trumps salad any day. I enjoyed the chunky mushrooms that dotted the soup and it had a thicker consistency that I like in my cream of mushroom. Cream of mushroom can be the soup of the say every single day! Also would not share.  Waiting for my \"carved at the table\" prime rib, I checked out the condiments presented to me. Lawry's seasonsed salt, Lawry's seasoned pepper, a dollop of cream (or is it mustard?), and some horseradish. Spoiler Alert: The only thing I touched was a little bit of the horseradish and that was just for posterity's sake. Like two bites and I'm good without it. Then Manuel, the chef came around and was ready to present the gloriousness to me. I was very excited.  DAMN, THAT PRIME RIB WAS GOOD. Perfectly roasted, the meat was very tender and juicy. I tried to dip a bit of it in the mashed potato gravy but decided that it was better on it's own. Even yummy when it's kinda cold! My room didn't have a microwave but it worked out!  This experience is to say I treated myself out to a nice lunch but I also ended up eating my leftovers for dinner. I wanna say that was fairly economical. Now I want to either go to the original Lawry's or hit up the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco again! You know, for market research :P",

I ordered the California Cut and includes the prime rib, mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding, and salad. The salad was ok. I didn't really like the dressing and there was more beets than there was lettuce. The worse part, however, was the prime rib. I've had way better prime rib at a way lower price point. The meat was cold, fatty, and lacked flavor. The mashed potatoes just tasted like unsalted butter, with a not too flavorful gravy. The yorkshire pudding wasn't too bad. I did order a side of the buttered peas to go along with my plate and they were great (but you can't really go wrong with making peas). They did bring out a free dessert for my birthday. It was a coconut cake with ice cream, but they poured canned pineapples all over the cake so I was unable to try it because I'm allergic. I expected so much more from Lawry's, but all I got was overpriced bland food. I will not be returning that's for sure!",

They served a delicious salad as an appetizer which was spun right infront of us. The prime rib was so succulent and delicious. The sides were mashed potatoes, cream of corn and Yorkshire pudding. Everything was delicious.   For dessert we ordered the creme brulee.   Everything was amazing here, the food, staff and ambiance.   Will come back!!!",

The staff was friendly and professional. We were escorted to our booth which had a burgundy colored ribbon across it. Which meant we were celebrating something special.   Our server Ms. Guzom. (I believe that's her name) was so friendly and attentive. She was awesome. My husband had wine. He loved it but I tried their famous cocktail. The Great Scot. Basically, a scotch margarita. Holy @%$# I loved it. Yes, I had another one also! LOL.  We started with the shrimp cocktail. Yum! Then we had the Lawry's Cut with salad, mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and creamed spinach. OMG..it was the most tender Prime Rib I have ever had. The horseradish sauce compliments it well. The meal was great and filling.   We were given a mini German chocolate bundt cake with the coconut pecan frosting in the middle and lightly drizzled with chocolate with the whipped cream just off to the side. Delicious! Even the valet's were awesome.   In all, this made our wedding anniversary special. Applause, applause Lawry's! You're the best!",

The place seemed pretty dead, but the restaurant has a very business-like feel so I imagine it heats up for late lunch and dinners.  I heard good things about the prime rib and salad, which are cooked and made, respectively, in front of you, so I decided to try one of them - the Lawry's Prime Rib.  Since it was lunch, the prime rib cooking aparatus came around to our table and was cut directly in front of us. It was very good but I thought it was over-hyped and over-priced.  It is very interesting and unique that they cut the meat in front of me, but I was not overly blown away by my experience.  i would try Lawry's again, but it is not on my must-try-again list right now.",

The prime rib cart is a very unique & inviting, but the service was way, way off.   The waiter forgot the Whipped horseradish sauce, Bernaise sauce, green peppercorn sauce & Yorkshire pudding... These items did not arrive at our table & we had to track the waiter down & request what we had ordered.  Meat was a little over-cooked & there was no offer of bottled water.  In spite of all that the place is lovely, the food is tasty & the waiter was pleasant. If there had been any level of service, it would be a 5 star.  The banana, coconut cream pie was very good.",

It rivals the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco and that place is one of the pinnacles in the heart of Foodie Town.  The service there was amazing.  My waiter made sure that I was well taken care of even though he had to wait on a large party.  He never made me feel like I was less important and I appreciated that to the nth degree.  I also got the Creamed Corn and Creamed Spinach sides and they were perfect complements.  What an amazing experience.  Highly recommend to the meat lovers who are looking for a high-quality dining experience.",

    "text": "Since the day we moved to Las Vegas, my husband has been hopping up and down to eat at Lawry's. He grew up in LA, near where the original restaurant still operates. I had a class on Valentine's Day, so we decided to make this our Valentine Rewind (and to celebrate our recent elopement).  We set an early dinner appointment (5:00), as all morning we were rushing from church to Toastmasters, to walking the dog, etc. - and wanted to enjoy the rest of the evening. We arrived a few minutes early, still in our church clothes (so we fit right in), and decided to have a drink in the bar while we waited. I had a watermelon mojito (Oh. My. God.) Jim panicked and ordered a rum and Coke, his go-to drink. Both were expertly mixed, but each was over $12. A bit high for using Bacardi, frankly. If I'm shelling out that much for a small drink, I expect a higher-end rum. Still, the bartender was professional, congenial, and incredibly good at what he did.  The host retrieved us promptly at 5:00, took us to the main restaurant, and pulled the table out from the booth to allow us to sit on the far end. Nice touch.  I won't go into too many details, but overall, the experience was everything it should have been. Our waitress was spot-on, charming, and well-versed in everything about the restaurant (even though she shared with us that she was brand new). The food was positively amazing. I like my prime rib to be practically mooing - and it was. The house Cabernet was even perfect. I was impressed!  I loved the fine dining experience (chilled salad forks - YAY!), the old-fashioned uniforms, the tasteful art-deco interior, and even the friendliness of the valets (though we parked ourselves). They even brought out a complimentary piece of \"anniversary\" cake with a lit candle. Very sweet!  I was disappointed at all the rude Americans in jeans and t-shirts, not to mention the screaming child (thankfully in the farthest, back corner - but could still hear it several yards and a wall away). Did we simply do away with class, people? If you're enjoying a $100+ meal, you expect a tiny bit of decorum from your fellow patrons. I noticed that every single foreigner (even the huge clan of Aussies) were all dressed nicely. This is a trend I've noticed at church, weddings, and even funerals. Even bums on the street can clean themselves up for a special event, people! Stupid American pigs. Geesh. Not the restaurants fault, mind you, so no demerits for our boorish counterparts.  Overall, a perfect romantic meal with incredible food and service. We'll be signing up with the VIP club, and we will be back.",

The salad spinner was gimmicky.  The prime rib average at best.   I had the rib-eye cut, \"Rare\" (as did several at our table).  Came back nearly medium, as did the others.  The meat lacked significant crust, spice or smoke that makes a great prime rib.  If it had potential, i would have sent it back, but this was as good as this cut of meat would get.  Very lean actually, which is a sign of lower grade prime rib.  Service was great, friendly.  But for the price?  Never again.

We told him we don't drink alcohol but he asked us 3 times if we wanted \"something to drink\" and proceeded to name every beverage that costs money. My wife ordered the seafood dish of salmon and it came undercooked. The waiter admonished her that \"every restaurant cooks it this way so you should be ordering it well done.\" Really... I have to order fish well done at Lawrys. (Talking to us like we don't eat out very often when in fact he probably only can eat out there, on his shift break. Funny dude). When the \"silver cart\" came for my prime rib I ordered the small cut thinking that for $35 I would get a decent size piece of prime rib. Wrong !! The one piece i received was small and about 25% of it was fat. It was really tasty but $34 for that and some mashed potatoes ? Really ? Of course we had to politely refuse his requests for us to buy some side dishes as well. Bottom line is the food was tasty except for the fish being undercooked which they corrected. The waiter was attentive but always looking for us to buy something more then we wanted. Food OVERPRICED to the point where we felt stupid for sitting there with all these huge parties of people that are obviously there on business. Very few couples in the dining room. We tipped 15% because we didn't want to rip off all the others that depend on our tip ie busboys, bartenders, hostess etc.  For the comment he made to my wife he deserved NOTHING. Don't waste your money here when you can go almost ANYWHERE else for $74, (total before we used gift certificate), and get a great meal.",

Their service was impeccable- from the sweet hostess who was unfazed when we arrived 30 minutes late to our reservation, to the warm friendly bartender who chatted us up like we were old friends, to the waiter who was not condescending in the least bit, to the busboys who guided me back to my table when I drunkenly stumbled into the kitchen.  The food was solid. The prime rib was balanced with just the perfect amount of richness and seasoning. I ordered a medium and it was a True medium- the edges were seasoned and done well while the interior was still a soft pink and juicy. My date loved the Yorkshire pudding, I wasn't really a fan, but it was airy and puffed up to perfection. The mushrooms were rich and earthy, the perfect accompaniment. The mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and deliciously well seasoned. No bland taters here.  All in all, we had a truly wonderful evening at Lawry's LV. We decided to skip dessert because we were stuffed and totally satisfied, so our waiter went the extra mile and boxed up a mini cake for us saying that we couldn't leave without something sweet on our anniversary (!!) Major points up for this, we were an intoxicated mess that night and he should've just shooed us out the door. I left with a huge smile on my face and a slightly renewed faith that there are still nice people in the world.",

Enjoyed the Lohr Cabernet with our meals and that spinning salad was memorable. Creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were excellent and now I know what Yorkshire pudding should taste like. Fantastic!   May return one day, but only for a very special occasion.",

Sure, there's a lot of buffets and other joints in Vegas that offer prime rib; however, none specialize in it like these guys do.  I got the Diamond Jim Brady cut and it looked like a Fred Flintstone cut.  It was massive, rare and seasoned perfectly.  We also got the side of creamed spinach and garlic mash, which were amazing.  I could eat this weekly!  Arguably one of my favorite meals of all time.",

They bring the prime rib out on specially made 600 pound carts right to your table.  I ordered the California cut of prime rib and it was the perfect portion for me. I devoured their Yorkshire Pudding.  The pudding was delicious with a little prime rib juice on it.  I usually only eat ranch dressing, but I figured if Tyler G. (my personal travel guide) said to try the spinning salad with the Lawry's Classic Vintage Salad Dressing I should give it a whirl.  It made my head spin it was so tasty and fresh. We finished off our meal with a chocolate bag.  You might think you wouldn't have room for dessert after such a feast. That's why you should go with the chocolate bag.  It's light and fluffy and filled with Belgium Mousse.  It was the perfect dessert after my heavy feast.   I really liked the decor at Lawry's it made me feel like I was dining in some old fancy restaurant.  We had really good service.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  I had really high hopes given the stellar reviews, but I didn't really think it was that great. While I can see the appeal of having the prime rib sliced table-side, I thought it gave it a cheap buffet line carving station feel. The prime rib was good, but nothing extraordinary. It satisfied the red meat craving, but that's about it. I don't often get prime rib as it's not my favorite cut of steak, so the only means of comparison I have is The Prime Rib in DC, and Lawry's didn't come close to comparing. The bread pudding type stuff that they serve with the prime rib was delicious though; I have no idea what was in that stuff, but I ate almost the whole skillet meant to be shared with my husband.  The waitress was friendly, though I found it weird that they had to introduce themselves as Ms. ____. What is this, pre-school? And their uniforms looked sort of like flight attendant uniforms, and not in a sexy Vegas sort of way, more like a flight attendant meets Mary Poppins sort of way.",

    "text": "**Restaurant Week - Spring 2012**  Before I start, I should probably mention that I'm not actually a prime rib fan.  For whatever reason, prime rib has never really struck my fancy.  However, it is the hubster's favorite dinner, so when I saw Lawry's menu for RW, I thought we could give it a try.  I'm so glad that we did!  First of all, the decor and atmosphere are just fun.  It's vintage to the point of tacky, which is what makes it so fun.  The waitresses did look silly with the folded-napkin bonnet, but ours was wonderful and friendly.  I could tell she had a customary way of greeting tables and explaining the process since she kept calling us \"ladies and gentlemen.\"  We started the meal with the spinning salad, which was delicious.  The dressing and croutons were sweet and garlicky, and the overall salad was a nice, fresh way to start the meal.  I decided to join the hubster in getting prime rib, and to my eternal delight it was absolutely delicious!  I decided to get mine medium rather than medium-rare (the way I normally enjoy my steaks), and it made a world of difference.  The meat was tender and juicy, and flavorful in the best possible way.  I didn't even use as much horseradish as I originally thought I'd need/want to, since there was no need to mask the flavor.    The mashed potatoes were wonderful, with a delicious gravy (and I'm not even a brown gravy fan!  Hubster had the creamed corn (his favorite), and I ordered the creamed spinach.  Both were tasty, but a definite second fiddles to the main event.  We ended the night with coffee and dessert, hubster ordering the creme brulee and me the chocolate mousse.  Both were incredibly delicious, but almost an overly rich end to an overwhelming meal.   In all honesty the main complaint I had was that there was too much food!  The 10 oz. prime rib, although scrumptious, was much too large a portion for my taste.  I wish the 7 oz. portion would have been an option for RW since I felt wasteful after I was through (ironic considering the destination of the RW proceeds).",

The sour dough bread, spinning bowl salad and creamed corn are just as tasty as I remember. The prime rib fell a little flat. It was more tough and fatty than I recall. And it seems red meat thrills me less and less as I age. Dinner also came with lemon dessert and a bottle of Chardonnay. It was a great deal. It's probably heresy to say, but I may skip the turf and try the surf next visit. Because the Lawry's experience is truly solid.",

I have to admit, I'd never eaten prime rib before I went here. I just never had any interest. I ate it, and was told I can never eat it anywhere else. I fully believe that. It was so ridiculously delicious. I don't remember much else... I was beyond exhausted from a trade show and almost passed out on my plate.

    "text": "Prime rib is usually not my favorite cut of meat, but boy I have definitely changed my mind after coming here!  I would highly recommend getting the Prime Rib Dinner which includes: salad, a cut of prime rib, a side of mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. The Yorkshire pudding was a little odd, but more on that later.  The house salad is delicious, it's their signature \"spinning salad\" that is tossed table-side. After that they wheel around a whole cart of prime rib prepared to different temperatures depending on your preference. So you just tell them what size cut you want and the slice it right there for you. And I think my favorite part about eating prime rib is the horseradish sauce. Lawry's gives you two different kinds- the really concentrated kind which will clear your sinuses out for a week, and the whipped kind which is light a fluffy and better for the more sensitive palette.  The prime rib is served on the side of some mashed potatoes. You also have the option of some a la carte veggies like creamed spinach or creamed corn. Then they give you this Yorkshire pudding- which I always thought was a dessert. But it's a dry kind of bread that you let soak in the au jus and mop up all that delectable flavor.  Overall it was a nice dining experience and I'll be coming back again. Good for a celebration, or even a romantic night out.",

We made it just in time before they stopped dining services.  The restaurant feels very old-timey and fancy, but it's ok to walk in wearing jeans and casual clothes. Or at least that's how I felt.  Lots of different choices for meat. I can't remember which cut I had but it was definitely a smaller cut. I'm usually not a fan of prime rib, but this was pretty decent. Most of the fun with dining here is how they roll out these carts that look like those bullet RVs from the 50's. The Yorkshire pudding, which I had never had before, was pretty amazing with the prime rib. It's kind of like a soft bread.   There's a cart for their famous spinning salad. I don't know how to describe the dressing. I thought it might be more on the sweet side, but it's kind of this strange hybrid of different dressings, maybe with a little more balsamic than I thought. This was a nice starter to dinner.  Service was great. Our waiter was friendly and personable. I hear that menus are a little different between each location, so if I had a chance to go to another Lawry's, I'd definitely give it a try.",

    "text": "I've been lucky enough to dine at Lawry's four times now (I'm normally just on the East Coast, so it's an extra special treat!). This is an absolute must if you are in the Las Vegas area - it's a mandatory stop every time I happen to be in town. Their prime rib is the best I've ever had: carved table side and melt-in-your-mouth tender, with meat is so flavorful and perfectly prepared, you just can't beat this steakhouse. I'm a big fan of the English cut, which is three thin slices, though there isn't a wrong answer when you order your cut! The creamed corn side is divine (especially to someone who didn't think she even liked creamed corn) and the mashed potatoes are also great.  The following is more of an update than the core of my review:  The service, with one exception this past September, is always spectacular and on par with what you would expect at a restaurant like this. And during our recent poor service experience (we're talking our waitress being MIA for 2.5 hours and, when we did actually see her, still in high contrast to my experience of Lawry's quality of service in the past), the manager immediately stepped in upon our call and treated us to dessert for the inconvenience. Everyone has their bad/off days, and normally I wouldn't even mention it in this review - except it seems a number of other Yelpers have recently had poor service experiences there, too...hopefully a trend that is soon if not already resolved.  The service is typically as high quality as the food (and price point), but if it's not, don't feel uncomfortable asking other staff members for assistance. They were all very friendly and happy to help. I don't know if there was a drastic change in staffing or management, but one poor service incident is not enough to tarnish my three other fantastic experiences, and the food quality is superior/has never even slightly faltered in light of it.  The ambiance is quiet and classy, but feels old-school with the waitresses adorning the original 1950s uniforms. If you aren't already in Vegas for business, be sure to pack a nice outfit, as this is indeed an upscale restaurant - and one that's not to be missed!!",

The restaurant has an old school vibe- where the server is called Mr or Miss and their last name.... the server greets you with a smile and very friendly demeanor, and  starts you off with warm sourdough bread, then prepares the famous \"spinning bowl\" salad table-side. The server then returns with the carver who cuts the meat table side, and you can choose which sides to accompany your prime rib. I had the Lawry's cut with potatoes, and the creamed corn- I then had the creme brulee for dessert! I was pleased with my choices!    The meal was very good and I enjoyed the experience!",

Our server was Mrs. Morrison.  She was great...friendly, personable, and helpful.  My parents and I all had the prime rib...of course!!  Mrs. Morrison explained the Yorkshire pudding and that it wasn't a dessert, but used to soak up the prime rib juice.  Never would have tried it without her explanation.  Excellent!!!  Thanks! Everything about the meal was extraordinary: spinning salad, prime rib, mashed potatoes and gravy, creamed corn and Yorkshire pudding! After dinner they served my mom a mini bundt cake for her birthday.  An excellent dinner for an amazing night!!! I would highly recommend it to anyone!",

    "text": "Solid 5 star experience every time we go. We go about every other month. We are part of their VIP plan. It is a wonderful program that I absolutely recommend. It was $25 at the time we signed up and they send you a $25 certificate to come back. You get points for the money you spend and get gift certificates when you spend a certain amount. They also send you gifts for your birthday and anniversary.  The experience from the time we walk in is top notch. The hostesses are great, they remember us even if it has been three months since we've been there.  We always have a pre-dinner cocktail or two at the bar with Bruce. He is a great bar tender, very friendly, and very easy on the eyes ladies...(and gentlemen)! Their chips are yummy.  Dinner - we always request the same server (Jesus). They always try their best to seat us with him, we love catching up with him. If we can't sit in his section we still have a great experience. Prime Rib, Yorkshire pudding, the spinning salad, mashed potatoes...YUM. Everything is included with your Prime Rib and there is no need to get additional sides or appetizers. That said, we've had all the sides and a few of the appetizers and they are all great. We always finish with the glorious Sticky Toffee Pudding. I drool just thinking about it. It was better before the new chef took over a year or so ago but it is still super yummy. They used to serve it with Praline ice cream and a heavy whipping cream whipped cream almost buttercream like. Now it's just vanilla ice cream and a lite whipped cream.  It's always fun going when the carolers are there. It gives you the Christmas holiday warm and fuzzies.   I recommend going in small groups 2-4, 6 tops. Now they do a great job with groups. In my opinion it's just a better experience in smaller groups. They cut your prime rib and the table so it's nice when you can all eat at the same time.",

The only downfall was that our waitress didn't know our deal exactly and I had to keep correcting her. She said they offered a bunch of different deals and I can understand that.  First of all, it's a fun experience as they do prepare some items in front of you (like the spinning bowl salad and ice cream sundae) and you also get to see your cut of meat cut from the bone in front of you. Yum!  Food was delicious, and you get a lot of it. Salad, bread, yorkshire pudding (which was a first), mashed potatoes and of course, huge prime rib. We also received a side and 2 desserts with our deal. I had to roll out of the place.   Overall, the basis of old fashioned service and high quality food was a great combo. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice evening off the strip.",

    "text": "Sorry, for getting this review up so late, been busy planning wedding stuff....Anyways, I was in town with some buddies for March Madness and my bachelor party.  So with all the debauchery and buffoonery that was going on, we ended up last minute choosing Lawry's for dinner.  So I do apologize if I can't write a detailed review or remember everything, I was well intoxicated by dinner time.   So we arrived for our 8:30 dinner reservation.  The place is located just off the strip, and there were plenty of parking.   I remember we sat in a very spacious room.  There were 8 of us, and we ordered countless shots and bantered throughout the dinner service.  We didn't bother with any appetizers, we all just ordered either the prime rib or rib-eye steaks, we weren't here to mess around.  I remember when you ordered your meal, it came with their \"signature\" salad and all the sides were complementary!  So we ordered a various amount of sides and enjoyed our meat as we feasted and enjoyed many beverages and shots!  As we were finishing our meals, we realized the place was empty and they actually close at 10:00, which is a little weak, especially for a Saturday night.  Other than that, the service was top notch, food was delicious and everything was on point.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place and wished one opened up in Phoenix or the Scottsdale Area.",

This cut was so huge it had two bones.  I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  The meat was flavorful and tender.  It was so moist I could taste the flavor of the juices with each bite.    The lunch came with two sides and we got the creamed corn and creamed spinach.  Both were winners!

The turkey sandwich is real off the bone turkey, which is something that is hard to find.  If you can somehow save room for dessert, get the sticky toffee pudding.  A little tip, asked for it to be split and served on two plates.  That way, you get a scoop of ice cream for each plate!!!",

    "text": "Had some reservations about going to a prime rib place in Las Vegas but if you go during lunch hours you can save time and leave spending half as much!  I'm not a huge meat eater in the morning, so I opted for the pastrami/prime rib hoagie with au jus, side of chips and potato salad. The sandwich looked deceivingly unimpressive in size, but I could honestly say that it was more than enough. The combination of salty pastrami, juicy and tender prime rib pieces, creamy gruyere with au jus was very satisfying. The chips tasted house-made and were a highlight to my meal. There was nothing special about the potato salad - they will be skipped in future visits. It was a great alternative to a bigger plate option.  Speaking of bigger plate options, others in my party ordered prime rib meals (Lawry's cut and the smaller version). The prime rib was just as juicy and tender, cream corn was rich, buttery and sweet but the Yorkshire bread pudding was another standout. A combination of a warm flaky croissant on the outside and a undercooked cruller on the inside, I devoured it : ) To top it all off we ordered a mountainous piece of chocolate cake. It was rich, moist, not too sweet, and had slabs of dark chocolate layered throughout. REALLY good.  The decor was classic 60's Las Vegas without being cheesy. If you can imagine eating at a restaurant in the movie Casino without the wiseguys, you would be in Lawry's. To add to this theme, our server was super attentive and super friendly. She (and everybody that attended to us) went out of their way to keep us happy as our dishes came. Definitely no regrets coming here. Next time I'll come back hungrier.",

    "text": "The gold standard for how customers should be treated when they are spending their money at your restaurant. We've been going here (and the Beverly Hills location) for years. What prompted my review was the comparison of eating at a celebrity chef restaurant on the strip, then coming here the next night. For the same cost, the service could not be more different. At Lawrys, you aren't a number, you are greeted by your name, treated like you matter, We had visits to table by the manager, chef and head waiter (who does that?) We felt just as important as the customers next to us who were spending obviously more than we were. Food was amazing as always. Take the visit off the strip and skip the celebrity chef spots.",

It did not disappoint. The sides that it comes with (creamed spinach, creamed corn) also did not disappoint! They come around with a cart and then cook the prime rib to your tasting next to the table. Thus, the food comes out quickly. The atmosphere is fancy table cloths with large chairs. It's a quick trip off the strip and in a nice area. I recommend it.",

(Chicago, etc. ) The parking remains a key asset, but the oddball service that was once quaint has been robbed of any uniqueness.  The forced measures when they deliver the potatoes, essentially a hostage negotiation for getting the right amount.  Diligence as you may have to over communicate the kind of cut you desire. Heaven forbid it is not on the cart. Your cut will mysteriously appear from another room.  The salad trick does not really work with already wilted goods. Blah. The fact that Guiness remains on tap could save your meal, but in a world of choices....Lawry's has been passed up.  Overall, it was the general unhappiness of the waitstaff and crew. Forced smiles and very stiff.  This was my experience a few months ago as well, so I am working on the theory that it has really diminished.",

Someone ordered a filet that was completely raw inside even though it came out last and they ordered it well. They tried to fix it by heating up the same piece of steak and returned it raw 2 more times. We finally gave up and told them she's fine not eating.

I kid you not, we watched 10 parties that came in after us get seated. When we asked the hostess what was going on, instead of trying to accommodate, she said oh what's your last name again? Did you check in yet? And didn't remember us even though we sat there for 20 minutes. She then gave us an excuse saying \"oh these people got seated because their rsvp for 7:30 also.\" Which made no sense because we were too and still checked in before all of those parties.  There were no apology or anything once we were seated. I'll be sticking to Lawry's in Beverly Hills for now.",

But if you want a solid salad, well-made steak, and mashed potatoes that will make you happy, you can get that here.  The atmosphere is professional and very art deco.  A fabulous place for a business meeting.  Not a great place for a date or family gathering, in my opinion.",

Walking into the restaurant, it had a very old-school vibe, I felt like I was an extra in a mobster movie. Through my whole experience, it was even better than what I was looking forward to.   Decor - very well-kept 80's vibe (or it could be brand new vibing the 80's? Very clean)  Service - all of the servers are dressed in very cute lolita-like outfits which kind of resemble 80's diner outfits, very cool. Our server was super friendly and attentive and gave good recommendations. I wish I wrote down her name so I could praise her; she was the brunette with bangs.  Food - the most important part - everything was impeccable. The food was amazing from start to finish. The prime rib is carved table side which was nice. I asked for a medium (I usually eat my steak medium-rare to rare, but prime rib tends to ooze a lot, so I opted for something more cooked), and it was a perfect medium. Highly recommend the creamed spinach and corn. (Although, I do not recommend the peas as it is boiled peas with a slab of butter on top). We also split our prime rib in half with a $15 splitting charge. I'm glad we did this as the portions are decently sized. With all of the sides and an appetizer, I was only able to finish half of the original cut. They also have a great wine list.   For the price, service, and quality, I would definitely come back here.",

The quality of the food and service were on par with the Beverly Hills location, but I think I like the interior of the Vegas location a little better. Started with the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which was excellent. The shrimp were very fresh, and the cocktail sauce had just the right amount of flavor and spice. For dinner, I had my usual Lawry Cut, medium rare with Creamed Corn. Lawry's still serves the best prime rib, in my opinion. They never disappoint! I'm sure I'll be back.",

I love that Lawry's specializes in one thing and does it well.  The servers have an old school look and vibe but are friendly and offer a consistent experience.  I am a big eater and always load up on a beef bowl cut with creamed spinach and mashed. Of course there is always the spinning bowl salad and chilled fork, nice touch! Love the sourdough bread and Yorkshire pudding as well. The Prime Rib is excellent and the experience is fun to repeat over and over.   Don't forget to join the loyalty program and get 10 or 20% back depending on dining day/time.",

I was craving Yorkshire pudding - which isn't an easy thing to find - so my friend surprised me with a lunch reservation here.  The service was perfect and Amy brought out a skillet of Yorkshire pudding before our food even came out. I asked for both au jus and brown gravy and really couldn't decide which was better - so I had to just keep eating both.  I had the lunch cut prime rib.  They wheeled out a big silver cart and cut my serving at the table.  They also have mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and creamed corn so of course I had all three.  The meat was so tender that I could actually just cut it with the side of my fork.  Everything was so flavorful and cooked perfectly - I was in heaven! For dessert (because that goes into a separate stomach compartment) we had the Elvis bundt cake.  It was banana, chocolate chip with peanut butter frosting and soooo good! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful - with high backed velvet booths and a very cool, art deco kind of look.  I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves great food and great service!",

Once inside, you'll find a charming bar is quietly tucked to the side, away from the main dining area.   The wait staff (last names only) are professionally dressed to serve you. There's a dimly lit ambiance with high back fabric booths and each guest is treated as if they were someone important.   The spinning salad is MUST! And you would be silly to not order the prime rib. A cart rolls out while they carve your style meat right in front if you. Some delicious sides could include cream corn, cream spinach, mashed potatoes, bread pudding, you really can't go wrong... unless you're on a diet.   Bon-a-petit!",

Last time I came here was with Randall S. for his birthday (7/30/16). It's the perfect restaurant to celebrate special occasions like birthdays, graduations and anniversaries etc. The white table cloth and dim lighting really sets the mood for a romantic night out.   We had reservations but arrived early and had time to order a drink at the bar. Two Moscow Mules and complimentary house made potato chips to snack on while we waited to be seated. A few sips later our table was ready.   Once at our table, our server explained the menu and gave a bit more information to my date since it was his first time there. We both decided on the Lawry's cut and we shared the sides. Creamed corn, asparagus, mashed potatoes with gravy and creamed spinach, also each meal comes with yorkshire pudding.   To start, they bring you the famous spinning bowl salad (appropriately named). I absolutely adore this salad and I'm not particularly a salad kinda gal. Then we ordered another round of drinks while we waited for our food. Shortly after the carver comes by with his glorious cart full of prime rib and all the fixings. You'll be asked how you prefer your prime rib. I always go with medium. My date ordered his medium well. He's not a fan of pink. Even when we went to Gordam Ramsey he ordered medium-well, he'll never learn lol.  Now back to the prime rib. Every bite is absolutely delicious. Juicy and tender, so flavorful. It literally melts in your mouth. I like to sprinkle a bit of the lawrys seasoning and just a touch of horse radish for a kick. Mmmm, perfection. After our meal was done they brought a surprise for the birthday boy. Chocolate cake with a single candle to make a wish. The look on his face was priceless.   The overall dining experience is as good as it gets. From the bartender to our hostess and not to mention our server. She was very attentive and made sure we were on schedule for the show we had tickets for right after. Can't wait to visit again. Until then I'll be dreaming of prime rib & yorkshire pudding.   Misc tips: Always make reservations and if you're up for the challenge, you can find all their recipes on their website. I've tried it, they really taste like the real deal. ; )",

    "text": "Oh, man. Large hunks of meat served table-side. Is there anything more beautiful than that? Nah.  Came here in a party of 12 to kick off a bachelor party weekend. A bunch of dudes sitting around the table drinking whiskey and eating prime rib sounds like a pretty good way to start. We had two servers who were very good with their recommendations and explaining what all the options were. Earlier in the year, I had been to House of Prime Rib in SF, and I felt like Lawry's was incredibly similar in its degree of service and traditions. Gotta love it.  Pretty much all of us went for the prime rib dinner with Yorkshire pudding, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, with the spinning bowl salad. I went with the Diamond Jim Brady cut, which was the largest, duh. There seems to be a lot of pomp and circumstance with all of the courses and how everything is served, but when it comes down to it, the food all just tastes really good, which is likely why it's so popular. The prime rib is cooked perfectly, the creamed spinach is delicious, and the Yorkshire pudding is unbelievably rich and comforting. We skipped dessert, but the desserts did look good, spying the neighboring tables.  Service was pretty attentive throughout the meal, and our servers managed to keep up with our copious drink order, which was very impressive. Prices were fairly reasonable for a steakhouse near the Strip, and it came out to about $75 a person, with a few drinks on each person's tab. Not too shabby.  An excellent choice for reasonably priced meats, especially amongst all the high-priced steakhouses on the Strip. Seems like I'll be in Vegas for a few bachelor parties in the future, so I'll be more than likely to recommend Lawry's.",

    "text": "My family was excited to come try Lawry's during restaurant week in Las Vegas. The four of us made a reservation days ahead of time at 830pm. When we were seated, our first server was pleasant until we asked about the restaurant week specials. Once a year many Las Vegas restaurants have special tasting menus with a portion of the profits going to charity. Our waiter rolled his eyes, turned his back on us when we asked about restaurant week, and told us he would be right back. 20 minutes later another waiter appeared.  Our second server was pleasant, but at this point it was almost 9pm and I could tell she wanted to leave even though we had a reservation for weeks. (The restaurant closes at 9pm)  When our food finally arrived, the sauce for the prime rib was luke-warm and very salty. The table-side carver was nice but gave me a medium-well portion when I asked for medium-rare. My wife's beef wellington was good; however the potatoes were barely warm. The food was good, but not great.  All in all, this was a disappointment and not worth the money. The first server was rude and our eating experience was rushed. If they don't want to serve people late, they shouldn't take 830pm reservations.   Next time, I would save the $50 per person and go to a different establishment.",

I had 5 visitors in town from Illinois and had never ate at a Lawry's and I was extremely excited to have them experience the place that I once loved and talked highly of. After this last visit last night, I will never recommend nor take anymore guests to your location! I was in tears at this dinner reservation we had last night, and our awful server was lucky my boyfriend's father insisted on tipping your awful server! I had asked if I can have bone in my cut and he said that cost extra because that's the \"Diamond cut\"....yet my boyfriend and his mother got a bone in their \"Lawry cut\" just the same cut I ordered, except they did NOT want the bone and I requested one but had to pay extra for it??? Why? Because I wanted it??? What a terrible birthday dinner this was for me. He never asked if we were celebrating anything, which we were. A Mother's Day for 4 Mother's, my boyfriend's college graduation and MY BIRTHDAY! We had an awful experience and luckily our server got a generous tip from my boyfriend's father because I didn't think he deserved anything at all. I am extremely pissed and embarrassed with the entire experience! My guests asked ME after we were served our salads, \"why is this called the spinning salad?\" I said well he spun the salad in the bowl and didn't tell y'all what he was doing because he obviously didn't care that y'all were watching. Geezuz I want to throw \"F\" bombs all over this review, but I'm trying my best to hold it together. I just can't fathom we spent $500 on such a disgusting experience! What has happened to your location? I used to visit frequently and ever since you added men servers that place has gone to junk. The last few times I had men servers and they all sucked! And of course I got another one last night! Of course!!!! The men show no enthusiasm, no friendliness, nothing! They all seem like they hate that job! Why did I not put down specifics in my reservation?!?! Oh, well I guess that wouldn't have mattered anyway, because I did specify celebrations and no one cares about that either.... I really wish I can have my night back and would have never gone to your restaurant, I couldn't even sleep last night because I was boiling! What a sad, very sad place this has became. I'm so disgusted. So much for being a \"VIP\" member. What a joke...",

Mrs. Bender was my waitress she was very sweet. Don't people come to high end restaurants for the peace and quiet? I thought so, but some child was screaming the whole time, and the parents did nothing about it! Now I gave the Mother the death stare, but she didn't do anything. Take the kid outside, I mean she is old enough to know better! Now onto the food. I am used to the great food at the Beverly hills location, back home where I live. The meat was tasteless and had lots of fat, the mashed potatoes, nothing special with canned gravy. Yorkshire pudding was decent. The spinning salad was very soggy and didn't seem fresh. Wine was OK, but cant screw up white zinfandel. LOL. Honestly,  I make better prime rib every Christmas. I hadn't eaten since 8 this morning, so I was damn hungry. Didn't finish the potatoes, but the cut of meat was small for 40.00 to me. Valet was nice, all the employees were, but I need good food to spend 61.00 for a meal Would not come back.",

I wanted rare and it was way overcooked for me.  Medium rare would have been ok but was way overcooked for my taste.  I had a little and left the rest.  As I was leaving I saw a couple prime ribs being served from same server that was exactly how I wanted it red and juicy not brown, I said oh you do have rare, he said wasn't in the cart he had at my table.  I was with a friend and with his friend who worked there so I didn't complain but I shouldn't have had to.  They should have realized that they should get me what I ordered not just what was available in the cart when obviously they had other carts with what I requested.",

You're basically paying for the ambiance. Our family was so disappointment; we will not be going back.",

    "text": "Mediocre!!!!!!!!! My husband and I decided to have dinner off the strip and chose this place. I wanted to try this place out for myself since I love House of Prime Rib in San Francisco. Maybe the name \"Lawry\" would step up the entire meal due to its namesake. We had told the waiter it was our first time dining there. We didn't get an explanation of the menu unlike House of Prime Rib. I understand the majority of the menu is self-explanatory but it would be nice to feel comfortable and welcomed at an establishment we are spending a good amount for dinner. We placed our order and he basically gave us a look and told us he didn't take orders for the prime rib that we had to wait for the Chef to come around to order from him. We would've known that if he had explained the menu in the beginning. He only took drink orders and side orders.   I can say that it was a complete disappointment. I was very saddened that I didn't enjoy the prime rib at all. It was tough and very chewy. It was not seasoned well. When we received it, it was lukewarm at best. The plate was by far warmer than the prime rib itself. The au jus was simply okay. Nothing special at all. Poorly prepared! I will stick to House of Prime Rib in San Francisco from this point forth.   I had ordered a lobster tail. Please I ask of you... PASS ON THE LOBSTER TAIL(if you still plan on checking this place out after reading my review). It was so rubbery and overcooked. Trying to cut a piece off was difficult enough. Just imagine chewing a piece??? It was like chewing on a rubber band.   Btw... They'll ask you if you'd like creamed spinach or corn along with the prime rib and mashed potatoes and not tell you that side order is an additional $7. I don't mind paying but I'd like to know its additional. I could've passed on it since it was simply forgettable.  This place was a FAIL in every aspect.",

Jim Brady Prime Rib cut: a good portion if you're hungry. I got medium rare. It was juicy and flavorful. Not a lot of blood.  Creamed Corn: I ate this cause it was highly recommended. Although I got a stomach ache (dairy, not quality), I don't regret it!!  Old Fashioned: This was not made well. It tasted way too sweet and the proportions were way off!  Service: Nothing stellar but we had a group of 20 so this is understandable.  Overall, I see why this place is popular. Does the price justify their food? Sort of....but everything tastes good.  Tip: I heard the rib eye tastes excellent for those who are not too fond with prime rib!",

Now as an adult I was were socks with polka dots but you could see them under my boot. This is a fancy place, we talking jackets and dress. The also have a small valet outside if you're feeling like a VIP. We however self parked and walked through the revolving door. We checked in with the hostess and maybe waited 5 minutes. While be walked to the table they were being really courteous. Asking us questions like if we lived here and if we were celebrating anything. Of course we were just here to stuff our face. :)  We sat down and already had an idea of what we were ordering. We went with the Diamond Jim Brady Cut. It's an extra thick portion. Me and my friend decided to split everything. They started with the salad. This was so fun to watch. It's a spinning bowl and they pour the dressing in and mix. After finishing the salad they brought the prime rib station over. They cut our piece and gave us an extra plate. They asked us how we wanted it cooked and we said medium well and we kinda got medium. We just ate it anyways, not a huge deal. The prime rib came with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire Pudding. The pudding is like bread and by itself is good but dipping in the juice and potatoes with some seasoning was very tasty. My favorite part of the whole entire meal was the seasoning pepper. I have a slight addiction to pepper and I was not disappointed with this all over my salad and even a little on my prime rib. We also order a side of scalloped potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus weren't cooked enough for me, but the scalloped potatoes were a mouthwatering side. With our dinners we had a ginger ale and a glass of wine. We order a mocato and it was the best I've had. We asked for the name again and the server wrote it down for us. She was so sweet. She explained everything to us and gave us the rundown on the menu too. We ended our meal with creme brulee. It was topped with fruit and probably the only good picture I took. The hard caramel was left for last to enjoy and savor..  We left full and were really happy with our choice to dine for the evening.",

The ambiance is Old Hollywood. I got a cherry mash Old Fashioned in the cocktail room, and it was fantastic. The soda water is an unusual ingredient but adds more depth to the flavor profile. Overall, the drink is worth it's price.  For dinner, I would never consider anything but the prime rib. I got the Diamond Jim Brady with mashed potatoes, creamed corn and Yorkshire pudding with a salad serving as the starter.  Salad: Light and satisfying, helped by the beets and croutons. Prime rib: Incredible. Delectable. Cooked to perfection (I had the cut medium rare). Mashed potatoes: Perfectly creamy. I wish the gravy served with it was lighter, more like an au jus. Creamed corn: Wonderfully sweet. The corn tasted like it could've been cooked longer. Yorkshire pudding. Always great and best when dipped in the natural juices of the prime rib.  I love the experience here and am always grateful when I can attend.",

I also had the Chopin dirty martini with prime rib, horseradish and blue cheese (b.c. On request) stuffed olives, $16 but worth it! It was strong but soooo smooth.   I'm giving it 4 stars because I personally think the uniforms and ambiance make me feel like I'm in a geriatric ward nightmare but I guess some people like that.

I suggest signing up for their club card as the rewards add up swiftly and come in very handy when you eat here as often as I do.   (My only complaint is the way the patrons choose to dress when they come here. Sloppy and disheveled:( This is a top-light classy establishment so, please have some dignity and show respect for the business itself. )",

Yes, it's expensive.  Prime rib, wine, and deserts for two persons, with gratuity came out to well over ~$100.  First off, the food here is second to none; 5 cuts of the Prime Rib to choose from.  No matter which one you pick, you will be happy, and impressed!  Second, the service here is very good.  What I specially am referring to is the attentiveness of the staff.  They are also very friendly and take time to talk to you about your visit to Las Vegas.  I was very eager to tell them how I enjoy coming to this particular dining establishment.  They are one of the very few which specializes in the Prime Rib dish, and knows how to deliver it in a way that is second to none.",

We received our first course (salads) around 45 minutes after we sat down. AND he poured the dressing right in front of us. Did they have to grow the romaine lettuce in the back real quick?   I honestly can't wrap my head around a 45 min salad.   The iced tea that my friend ordered, came AFTER the salads.  Then, as we sat there with our salad plates cleared and nothing on our table, we had to stare at the prime rib cart, that was right in front of our table. The prime rib was already cooked and in a cart, sitting right in front of our table...and it took 15 minutes for that to get in my mouth!   It is a good prime rib, though I've had better. I had to salt it a bit for flavor. Eh, cream corn. good mushroom side.  THEN, we wanted to pay and get to a show, can't find the waiter to pay!",

I was in Vagas recently and had to celebrate a big 2-team parlay winner. Their prime rib was fantastic. I usually get their Lawry Cut and this time was no different. I like their creamed corn, but not their spinach. Also, the bread they serve is fantastic. Their Spinning Salad may be famous, but it is just ok tasting to me. Same goes for their Yorksire Pudding. I don't really order any dessert because I'm too full from the meal.   One more thing, you can save some cash if you hit their lunch schedule (M-F 11:30AM-2:00PM) instead of their dinner schedule.",

I really enjoyed the wine and my creamed corn was very good.  My favorite part of dinner was the yorkshire pudding though.  I don't know where else you can go to find yorkshire pudding so I might go back just for their yorkshire pudding lol (it was that good).   Service: I was very very amused that waitress communicated to the meat slicer for us even though he could obviously hear our orders.  The service is amazing though. Not one complaint. Setting: I loved how comfortable the booths were.  The bar is separated from the diners which I enjoyed as well.  The lighting was dim, so it was definitely could be a romantic setting.",

    "text": "Let me summarize this way: this restaurant is one block off the center of Las Vegas Strip, and it is only 75% full around 7:30pm on a busy Saturday night, when there is a minimum wait of 30min for some worst buffets on the Strip.  I am a prime rib lover, and go to \"House of Prime Rib\" in San Francisco 5-6 times a year. It has been told that \"House of Prime Rib\" is a cheap imitation of Lawry's. So we decide to try the original. We made the reservation 2 month ahead and thought this place would be totally packed like House of Prime Rib on a Saturday night, especially it is right off the strip.  We were 30 min early thinking it gonna be a super busy time for them as our reservation was 7:30pm on a Saturday. Finding it was pretty much empty (about 50-75% full), we asked if it is possible to seat us early. The answer was a firm NO. The reason? \"We were fully booked.\"  At 7:30pm, we were seated promptly. Their menu looks just like House of Prime Rib, except Lawry's has lobster tail and mushrooms. Their price point is almost identical except you have to pay extra ($6) for cream of spinach.  The waitress has funny uniforms, looks more like in a road side diner in 1950s than a fine restaurant. And they forgot our bread (inexcusable for a $50+ per person restaurant).  When they started serving our prime rib, it was 8pm. The restaurant is pretty empty, with about 50-75% full in the dining room, and totally empty in the bar and the waiting area.  The \"spinning salad\" is not fresh at all. The lettuce looks a little dry and shows a little brown. This was a total disappointment as I love the salads in House of Prime Rib. Lawry's salad dressing is also a little more sour, which tastes like those bought in the supermarket (so much for their world famous salad dressing).  The bright spot is the prime rib. It is fresh, juicy and a total 5 star! But the portion is on the smaller side. My wife and kids ordered the smaller prime rib and it is so small, they finished in 5 minutes. My Lawry cut is pretty decent in size, although still smaller than House of Prime Rib.  Weird thing is that Lawry's does not serve au jus with the prime rib. Hmm, did they forgot it or they just do not serve it?  Their Yorkshire Pudding is a disaster. It is burned and dark. Looks like they did not put any egg in there. Did not taste good.  They neither have choices of how potato is served. Mashed potato only. I love the baked potato from House of Prim Prib :(  Did not ask if they gave second serve of prime rib for free as in House of Prime Rib. Given how we experienced so far, I did not want to embarrass myself by asking the question.  Obviously we won't be back to Lawry's Vegas. Already made reservation for my next trip to House of Prime Rib ...",

    "text": "Every time I go to Vegas I pass Lawry's and have always wanted to try it.  For some reason I didn't have really high expectations because I just thought this was the seasoning people who opened a Prime Rib restaurant.  Boy was I wrong!!  This place was AWESOME!!  The atmosphere was nice.  Elegant, but yet didn't feel too stuffy.  There was lots of wood & the booths were really high.  When we were seated, the maitre d pulled the whole table out so we could just sit (instead of wiping the entire seat with our butts) and then he pushed the table back in place.  We had at least 2-3 people taking care of us at all time.  Our waiter and his assistant were very attentive (& friendly), but yet I never felt like they invading our privacy.  Never saw them, but whenever I needed something . . . bam they there were.  Now I am a steak lover, but I could definitely stray for this place.  Of course I ate the prime rib, however since I decided to add a lobster tail I decided to just have the smallest cut (California cut).  The prime rib was melt in your mouth delicious!!  Included with your meal is their famous Spinning Salad (crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped egg and croutons, tossed with their Vintage Dressing), mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and whipped horse radish.    Thinking to save room for dessert, we decided not to order any other sides, however our waiter (knowing that it was our first time), brought a complementary order each of the creamed spinach and creamed corn.  Now that's a lot of food for just 2 people and I was so full I never made it to dessert!!   For mini entertainment they mix & plate the salad tableside as well as carve & plate your prime rib.  The prices are about the same as any good steakhouse.  However to me, the price was definitely worth it.  The food & service were excellent and I definitely recommend this place to everyone.  From now on this place will definitely be on my \"must do\" list when I go to Vegas again.",

Most steakhouse I know are usually dark, but this place was just a little bit brighter.  A very classy looking place for a classy meal.  Other than that, the meal will be very similar to House of Prime Rib on Van Ness in San Francisco.  But Lawry's opened it's restaurants first, so I will give him the credit for this type of steakhouse.  Now we get sat down with a reservation for 7 within a few minutes and the waitress kindly tells us the specials and has enough knowledge to educate us on the types of wine to order.  After enjoying the company, a server tosses and spins a salad for us.  I was hungry so it tastes great.  I think it's the Thousand Islands-type of dressing that makes it.  Next, we are greeted by a large steel cart and master carver.  I got the Lawry cut prime rib and shared some lobster.  Wow, so delicious.  Accompanied with mashed potatoes, cream of corn, cream of spinach, asparagus, Yorkshire pudding, and fine wine made this prime rib even better.  The sides that we got we pretty small so be weary of that.  The lobster tails we got were actually superior to most high end places that I've been.  It tasted fresh and didn't really need the drawn butter.  This meal and sharing stories with my close friends really made for a good bachelor party meal.  Thanks guys.",

Simply put, it was the best prime rib we have ever had, and also one of the best dining experiences we ever had.  Service was fabulous, with incredibly attentive, accommodating and friendly staff.  We were given a large comfortable booth that gave us a clear view of the classy dining room.    From the spinning salad, to the perfectly medium rare prime rib, to the complimentary dessert (it was our anniversary), the meal was absolutely superb.  Even though I was utterly stuffed, I wanted more.  The meat was so juicy and tender, accompanied by a generous portion of mashed potatoes and gravy and yorkshire pudding.  It was everything we had hoped it would be and more.  Whether for an intimate dinner for two or a special dinner with friends and family, Lawry's is a guaranteed perfect meal from start to finish.  I only wish Lawry's had a presence on the east coast!",

First of all, we had a reservation and arrived 15 minutes early, but we didn't get seated until 25 minutes later because they forgot about us...   The food was good. We got a bottle of \"Lawry's The Prime Rib, Private Selection\" Merlot which was surprisingly good. The spinning salad was pretty cool; they gave us a cold fork with it too. I got the Diamond Jim Brady Cut prime rib; it was cooked to perfection, but it was soooo thick that the meat was kind of chewy. I think I prefer the Lawry cut because it's thinner so the meat is more tender. The sides (mashed potatoes, creamed corn, creamed spinach, buttered peas, Yorkshire pudding) were good, except for the fact that there was a hair in my mashed potatoes. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I didn't bring it to their attention. Because it was my birthday, they gave me an English Trifle which was really delicious; the degree of sweetness was just right.  Overall, I was a little disappointed by my experience because I expect a lot more from such a fine restaurant.",

Half way through serving our order, the chef ran out of medium so he gave us an order of rare and an order of well done.  On top of that, the temperature of the prime ribs were too cold.

I ordered the California cut and the meat literally melts in your mouth. The first time I dined here I was so awed by the chef pushing a huge cart around with big slab of prime ribs. Also, your prime rib comes with salad, mash potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. Definitely one of the best and reasonably priced meal out here in Vegas. We took an uber from planet Hollywood and it cost us 7 dollars to get to Lawry's. Well worth my 7 dollars for uber and the price of dinner was amazing for the amount of food!",

    "text": "I'm not that much of a prime rib person although I appreciate it now and then if it's high quality.  But this was grossly overpriced and overrated.  I prefer a good steak, but I went with the flow of the friends I was with, two of whom came from out of state and wanted to go here and I figured I may as well try the prime rib anyway since this place is so famous for it.  I can only speak for myself, but I was disappointed.  For over forty dollars I got the California cut and ordered the end cut because I like the spicy crustiness you get more of with that cut.  They didn't bother asking how I wanted it cooked and It was a thinly-sliced, skimpy, not very tender piece of meat swimming in a thin, non-homemade tasting gravy.  Overall it had OK flavor, but nothing special.  I've had much better elsewhere for a lot less money nor did I get much of that flavorful crusty quality.  Ditto on the mashed potatoes, a small portion which was rather thin and diluted-tasting and lacked that rich creaminess you would expect to get at a fine dining restaurant.  I can make those better in my sleep.  The spinning salad was OK, but kind of soggy and I thought the house dressing was a little too sweet.  The Yorkshire pudding was an interesting addition, I don't think I had ever had it before.  It was pretty good, kind of like beef flavored French toast, but still nothing great.    The service was friendly and attentive although I think they took too long bringing out the prime rib and made too much of a production out of it which I wasn't impressed with.  The surroundings were plush, but really didn't do anything for me at the time.  Overall, I just felt forty+ dollars was an obscene amount of money to pay for what I got.  Honestly, imho, take away the fancy service and surroundings and this was a ten dollar meal, twelve tops, on any given night at a typical diner.  And that's it.",

We both got the Lawry's cut, with the creamed corn, and spinach. The prime rib was generously cut, and way too much for me to finish, but it was the perfect amount for my boyfriend.  Our server was superb, and recommended a delicious (though quite spicy) red wine for us.  Overall excellent meal, great service, and beautiful decor.   Tips: - There is really no need to valet. Parking is free. - Make reservations through yelp! (opentable)  - Order a half bottle of wine! Perfect for two glasses of wine each",

For $99, you get   * Lawry's Original Spinning Bowl Salad * Lawry's Special 8 oz. Cut of Roasted Prime Rib of Beef and  * one 4 oz. Lobster Tail,  * served with Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes and whipped cream horseradish,  * as well as a choice of creamed corn, creamed spinach, or buttered peas  or   * Fresh Salmon * and one 4 oz Lobster Tail with seasonal accompaniments  * C.C. Brown's Hot Fudge Sundae Sampler * Freshly Brewed Coffee or Tea  We both had the prime rib with creamed spinach.  Dessert was a simple sundae, which is probably all one can eat after filling themselves up with their fresh bread, salad, prime rib, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding, and oh yes, the lobster tail.

The food was delicious and did not disappoint, however, to be honest, at this price point, I would have expected the other patrons to be dressed better. The amount of plain t-shirts, jeans, and tennis shoes that I saw was shocking. I even saw a guy wearing a hockey jersey and jeans. When you are spending close to $75/person or more for dinner, you expect a little more. I am not sure if this is just a problem at the Las Vegas location. I would rather take my money and go to Del Friscos or Flemings. (The 4 stars are for the food & service. I would give the atmosphere a 3.)",

Wife had turkey plate (I tried to remind her Lawry's is for prime rib, dammit, not Thanksgiving) and for $16 she got several choice cuts of bird (it was pretty good), gravy, mashed potatoes, creamed corn and even begged a piece of Yorkshire pudding.)  I had prime rib sandwich on ciabatta for $14.  We split the house salad (a la spinning salad) and got two fuck-off sized cookies.... for a dollar.  50 cents for a cookie about the size of a porn-star's silicone implant.    Now, think to your typical Vegas-strip casino piece of crap coffee shop or cafe.  You will pay around $10-15 for a sandwich.  It will not be anywhere as good as Lawry's beef.  Nor will you get hands-on service, and homemade potato chips to munch as you wait, plus a salad bar with fruit, potato, pasta salads.    We will hit this place up every single visit to Vegas from now on for lunch.  Thank you for such a remarkable deal.",

I am not a big steak eater so when i do decide to eat red-meat i like to go to nice steak restaurants to get the best of the best, This was my 2nd day of restaurant week las vegas 2012. I brought a party of 7ppl all chefs or office folks in the industry.  We started with their Signature Spinning Salad,.,which was greens served with like a vingerary french dressing..it was blah..i would have prefered a caesar salad with steak  The main entree was the lawrys choice cut which is carved at your table with all the fixins served hot right off the carving cart. The cut was 10 oz and cut to order so covered in au jus served with mashed potatoes and your choice of creamed corn, creamed spinach, or peas..i choice the creamed corn which was buttery and sweet..and of course creamy..very yummy mashed potatoes tasted homemade with brown gravy no salt needed and the prime rib was so juicy and tender we cut it with a butter knife- i was very happy with the meal  i finished it off with the hot fudge sundae served with heated hot fudge that the servers pour table side.. i should mention the salad is prepared table side and served chilled which was a nice show but i did not care for the taste The ambience was very old hollywood like eating at the Derby..red velveet booths..high back chairs..kinda reminded me of a 50s cigar saloon..that frank sinatra would frequent..very classy upscale and quiet..although they were very welcoming to my 4yrold who frequents upscale dining with me often.. I would have liked the server to be more aware of the restaurant week menu because that is what we came for to support the charity..i had to remind her of few thing that were included in the menu..and we got charged for coffee and tea which was advertised to be included..i asked it was she said no but after looking it up online on my phone and talking to the hostess it was in fact included..and although it was only 25 bucks for all our coffees and teas it is disappointing to have a server now know whats going one.. I know most of the servers have been there for many many years and prolly have their speil down to robotic memory but it would have been nice to not have such a scatter brain for a server..other than that the meal was amazing and great portion sizes for the price",

    "text": "I'm finding that it's more difficult to review Lawry's Prime Rib than I thought it would be. It is definitely a worthy experience to be enjoyed. Therein lies the problem. The experience is more enjoyable than the food. The restaurant and lounge are lovely. The Art Deco inspired dining room and the uniformed servers are like stepping back in time to 1930's Hollywood. There is an aura of elegance and sophistication in the main dining room that rivals any gourmet restaurant on the strip. Friends and I have made Lawry's an annual holiday tradition. During the month of December, Olde English Carolers in Victorian costume perform table side on the weekends. It's an evening we all look forward to. However, the food really doesn't leave much of an impression. I echo other reviews here in that the prime rib is decent, but flavorless. The sides may be traditional but really  don't add anything to impress on the star of the meal. Recently I had the chance to dine at one the upscale restaurants at Disney's California Adventures. I immediately thought of Lawry's. The experiences are very similar: memorable surroundings; forgettable food.",

First a martini in the bar. Quick and friendly service and a nice pour.  Then into the restaurant. The servers wear bizarre outfits but they do a great job table side.  The big silver serving tray looks like the front of a WWII bomber- silver and shiny. Inside is the meat.  They cut it right at the table which is a nice detail.  Staying w the traditional order I had mashed  potatoes and brown gravy,  corn and spinach and Yorkie Pudding. All tasty.  Honestly I've had better prime rib but the presentation, sides and overall meal was quality   Recommend",

    "text": "Walking into this restaurant is like walking back in time to the 1980's....shabby velvet booths, waitresses dressed in ridiculous aprons and bonnets, dirty carpets and a wait staff of women old enough to be MY grandmother!  Prime rib was fatty and baked potatoes were undercooked.  The entire atmosphere seemed very dated, including the way they pull right up to your table to slice off a big slab of fatty meat for you.  We were very disappointed, as this place is literally right next door to our new vacation home.  Won't be going back to Lawry's.",

And on top of it all.... you can bring your own wine for a corkage fee of $10.   The prime rib is fantastic... best in town, I think. Mind you... I only have prime rib like twice a year and one of those times it's at Lawry's so take that for what it's worth.   The spinning salad is really cool to watch being prepared but the salad itself is just \"ok\"... nothing super special. I'm not going to Lawry's for the salad so it's not a deal breaker.   The side of mushrooms are awesome but I wasn't all that impressed by the side of asparagus... it seemed small compared to everything else we ordered to share and they were salty on too which was odd.  Mash potatoes, cream spinach, yorkshire bread for dipping... all fantastic.   I'm not sure why we ordered the sampler dessert... but we did even though we were all stuffed....can't say that anything on the sampler plate was anything all that great. So, what I'm saying is... don't bother with dessert... just enjoy the prime rib dinner.",

If you haven't been there, the staff wears costume pieces from back in the day and will literally roll the prime rib up to your table, and cut the slice you want along with corned cream and bread pudding right in front of you. I always order either their California cut which is a smallest cut, or their English Cut which is 3 thinner slices. Their special beet/egg salad with house made dressing is something I always try to replicate at home but can never. They spin the salad and serve it right at your table. Around this time of year, they have carolers going from table to table to sing your favorite Christmas songs. It's such a wonderful experience coming to Lawrys every time.",

    "text": "This place serves the best Prime Rib I have had anywhere bar none. Located a bit off the strip this place gets overlooked but boy its worth a 10-15 min walk I took to come here.  I didn't have any reservations and had to wait in the bar area for a bit nevertheless I enjoyed one of the better martinis in the city. The main dinning area is old school with service to match (it reminded me of the bygone era of fine dinning shown in Mad Men). Though its Las Vegas and I saw people in casual clothes I would recommend dressing up when coming here.  Service was immaculate from start to finish. I ordered a shrimp cocktail for starters  which was served nicely chilled. The cocktail sauce was OK and the shrimp were large but run of the mill stuff.  For the main I went with the Lawry's cut of Prime Rib and ordered it rare. Salad was done table side an ode to old school fine dining. I am not much of a salad eater but this one was good and consisted of Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with their Vintage Dressing. Next came the main event a nice rolling trolley  with huge chunks of Prime Rib was brought table side and the meat was carved to my liking by an expert chef.  The main's come with an unlimited supply of Yorkshire pudding (very good) Mashed potatoes (OK) jus sauce (memorable) and Whipped cream horseradish but beef is the star attraction here. It is amazing how good the prime rib is and it is cooked to perfection. My cut was perfectly pink all around with a good meat to fat ratio. The crust was seasoned well and gave a nice contrast. I ordered some cream corn and mushrooms which were good as well but I don't think were needed as the main serving was generous.  I wanted to try some desserts but I was full. I must mention again how good the service was, my needs were anticipated and the servers would disappear after picking up stuff and refilling wine and water and not even once I had to look for them.  Wine selection is extensive though I didn't explore it much and stuck to a Cabernet. There you have it folks Las Vegas the way it was envisioned initially! 4.5 Stars!",

It's also a bit thinner than a regular prime rib cut, which my husband had and thoroughly enjoyed. We also both had the creamed corn, which was so good, it tasted like candy!  The salad a breads were also flavorful. We will certainly eat here again next time we are in town. Be sure to use the Lawry's seasoned salt on the meat and the seasoned pepper on the salad. Don't know why I never thought of that before!  The foods independent of the seasonings were very good - with the seasonings the food was taken to a whole new, fantastic level of deliciousness!",
