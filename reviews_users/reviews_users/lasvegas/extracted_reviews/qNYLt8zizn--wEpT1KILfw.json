For the price, it's an awesome bargain.  Egg Works has always exceeded our expectations.  The servers are always very pleasant, and more often, you can find a server with a great sense of humor.    Ya know what? They are so good... We're going to visit them today!  KUDOS to our favorite breakfast/brunch/lunch joint!!!  :)",

With that out of the way, let me say it's hard to beat this place for normal breakfast grub.  I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs skillet.  Christopher was working the counter, very quick, efficient, and just the right amount of friendly professionalism.  The corned beef was very good, shredded beef roast/brisket with potatoes and some spices thrown in to compliment the salted beef and the eggs were fresh.  Toast comes pre-buttered!  Which is great!  Normal jellies in the little single serve squares and the portions are large, enough for two in many cases.  The coffee comes with your own pot so you can have as much as you like and it's piping hot.   Don't expect gourmet, just very good, hearty food in large portions.  This place clearly has quite a few local regulars along with the tourists looking for something local.  I'll be back when I'm in the area.",

Our server PK was an extraordinary server full of energy and brought all good vibes to the table. PK gave great suggestions to the food here and was very attentive to our table and other tables around us.   The food here is exceptional. I ordered the the works omelette. It definitely lives up to its name. Four eggs with ham, bacon, sausage, green bell peppers, mushroom, onions, tomatoes topped with loads of cheddar and jack cheese. With my omelette, I had a side of their potatoes and the banana nut muffin which was very delectable and moist.   Overall this place deserves 5 stars from me because not only is their food great but their service from PK made our first time experience here better!   Definitely recommend coming if you need a good breakfast spot in Henderson, Nevada.",

    "text": "This was my first time at this location & WOW! Super impressed with the wait staff!! Gotta say my initial greeting at the door wasn't the best. I had walked up to the podium & there was a large party that got called in that came up from behind me who was seated. Then there was a couple behind me & the host went right to them & looked right by me. I had to speak up to him & tell him I was there to be seated. He then took me to be seated. Not sure what he thought I was doing while standing in front of the podium & hadn't walked in with the big party????? I was greeted maybe 10 minutes later by my waitress???? It seemed like forever but I was soooo hungry so who really knows....lol When our waitress came over she was very friendly & smiley. MANUELA was her name.  I placed my drink order & my breakfast while I waited for my friend to join me.  Soon after my friend showed up & Manuela came right back & got her order. Another waitress ended up bringing our food out. (Yes, both meals at the same time when I placed my before my friend did...not sure how that happened?) I was a little shocked with my entree because I thought it was a sandwich which it was but not your normal sandwich. I can't remember the name of it but it had a croissant on the bottom cooked in a pan with the ingredients on top & open with no top croissant. This waitress saw the look on my face & wasn't surprised since this has happened to other customers before. She knew what I wanted & went back & placed my order. Great team work!!! It was delicious but what was my favorite was your banana nut muffins!! OMG so soft, moist & served warm. I'm not a big fan of nuts in my breads or cookies but they were cut so small & it didn't ruin the muffin. I ended up with 3 & a loaf to go home with. It's better then the banana bread I make, I hate to admit this....lol If you want to try their banana nut muffin for free & it's your first visit there tell your waitress this! First visits & making it known gets you a free muffin & its sooooo worth it!!!  Restaurant was clean & a busy place which is always a good sign. Their bathrooms were nice too. Clean & kept well. They also have outside seating which I noticed when I left is doggie friendly. Place closes early @ 3pm but is open @ 6am. They also have other items on their newspaper like menu that don't' consist of just breakfast items. Definitely a place worth checking out, esp. this location. I've been to the one on Sunset & wasn't too impressed but I'd def. go back to this one & ask for MANUELA. Thanks for such friendly & fun service!!!",

Or if you have a sweet tooth like I do, the strawberry cream cheese french toast is a must try.  Really love that they offer a few alcoholic beverages.  Their Bloody Marys and Mimosas are delicious!   Service is always quick and friendly.  The food comes out so fast.

Lightning fast service with a smile & all expectations were met.  The waitress even gave me one of their banana nut muffins...she said she didn't want me to feel left out.  I usually don't do muffins, but I ate every moist crumb on the plate.  The only negative was the line to pay heading out the door about 10 checks deep.  Not a deal breaker as everyone seemed fat & happy.  Nice to have one of these joints so close by!",

Our server, Paul, was very direct but very friendly. We used the check in on Yelp at the end of our meal and received our free muffin which looks amazing (too full to try it yet!). I had the Stuffed French Toast, which was surprisingly delicious. My fiance had the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, which didn't have as much prime rib as we expected, but he liked in none-the-less. I'm sure we'll be back again soon.",

A pretty simple breakfast dish and found the steak to be underseasoned and dull. Still waiting for that great off the strip breakfast restaurant. Maybe one day!",

HUGE portions and, if you're not a big eater, most things on the menu can be obtained as HALF orders. EggWorks' waitstaff are really on the ball - have never been disappointed by the service. If you prefer sweet dishes you won't be disappointed either.  For those of us who live in Anthem this is definitely the place for breakfast! I've been less impressed with their lunch menu. That said,  I always try to order the type of food a restaurant is known for - so, for example,  if I'm going to a steak house I don't order fish. In this case as its a breakfast place I don't order lunch foods.",

I get the same exact thing at COCO's for $4.99.  The homefries are really good though and they do give you a nice amount of them, so that is good!  The muffin ( a bran banana nut it seemed like) was not even that good.  If they eliminated the muffin maybe they can have a 5.99 breakfast item which would be better I think.  I spent over $12 for breakfast to go......... for breakfast and an OJ.  The staff was super friendly though.  Not sure who often I would return as spending almost $13 for breakfast for just me is a bit much.",

I decided to sit at the counter and was greeted by Tina, who kindly introduced herself and made me feel like I was a regular there. Her attitude and personality are truly exceptional and her knowledge of the menu helped me discover a few things I didn't notice before. I could also see how other people eating were being helped out just as well as I was by her. I'm very happy I came in when I did, the food was great and Tina brightened my day and invited me back, so of coarse I will be back soon! Thank you Tina!",

Before I could look at the whole building, I noticed people walking in with their dogs!!! We decided to give them a try. Before we could take in all the great smell of food, there were multiple host happy and eager to seat us.   Joshua was helpful from the start. I ordered the mash potatoe omelette and with seasoned potatoes and I was not disappointed. After 2 bites I knew, I had found my new favorite breakfast spot! We will be back for sure!!!",

    "text": "EGGstatic there's a new breakfast joint that just opened up here in the Anthem area in the strip mall along Eastern between Horizon Ridge and Sunridge Heights.  I just did a quick glance of the menu but wasn't feeling any of their omelette selections till the  breakfast Hawaiian style section caught my eye! They offered 3 different meals; Spam or Portuguese Sausage with rice and eggs, Loco Moco( eggs, rice burger patty topped w/brown gravy)  and the Haole Moco (Westernized version with country gravy)  I went for the Haole one!   It was made right with rice on the bottom, layered with the burger patty and topped with gravy and 2 eggs.  I  just I didn't like the burger patty as much. I also thought more gravy is needed because the rice soaked it all up before I could finish it.  Otherwise not too bad.  Afterthoughts:  I should've ordered something on the lighter side.   The place is plenty big, bright and airy.  There is seating outside facing the busy street. Or you can sit at the counter or seat yourself in their large dining area.  The windows facing west has a nice view of the Anthem area.   Minor hiccups on service.  I seated myself (per sign at entry) and waited a few minutes till someone realized I wasn't being waited on yet. A server approached my table when she realized I wasn't helped yet and apologized for me being the only one there at the time and the 12 of them not tending to my table yet. Maybe because everyone is still green or it was still too early in the day, who knows.  I don't mind that they give you the check right away and you pay at the counter at your convenience but it is a pain and I do think the \"flip to yellow egg\" for help/service system is pretty lame.  I like that this place opens pretty early and they offer different choices for breakfast and brunch time and look forward to trying more food from their menu, but I have to say I still prefer the breakfast bakery cafe that has that savory waffle sandwich and Chopped Kale salad across the way.",

    "text": "My family eats breakfast here almost every Saturday. If I'm lucky to wake up, I get to join them.   I'd have to say the food is your typical breakfast. Omelettes, skillets, pancakes, French Toast, eggs any way you want. I love that you can order half-orders of skillets or just one pancake instead of a regular short stack. They have salads, sandwiches, and some lunch items. Check the specials board on your way in, they have a couple creative ones. What food stands out the most is their fresh made banana muffins. Served warm and so delicious! They come with most entrees, so if you choose toast instead, you are missing out! Egg Works are very family-friendly and prices are very reasonable.   Having frequented the other locations, I'd have to say this review is for the exceptional service we get here. We've had many servers and all of them have taken good care of us.  I can't lie and say that service has been top notch every time. Food has come out slower than anticipated. Orders have been messed up. However, they warrant a 5-star review because they always did a great job recovering as fast as they could. Servers were always friendly and attentive. I notice they show a lot of teamwork, especially since they have the system where when you need anything, you turn that handy-dandy egg over to signify service is being requested. No matter who our server is, the other staff are always open to lend a hand refilling coffee, delivering food, and cleaning up.   So we'll keep going for our ritual Saturday breakfast, for the service, the smiles... oh, and those yummy addicting banana muffins!",

The waffle itself was sweet, so it went well with the whip cream and the seasonal fruits. (Strawberries are my favorite)   We also ordered the Cajun cut potatoes (That is not what it's called, but they are those little cut potatoes that are seasoned with Cajun!) and they were very good. It kind of got salty at the bottom, but the potatoes were crispy and the Cajun mixed so well with them.   Our server Evan was so friendly and was always on top of things. They have a great staff! The one thing that bothered me was that we were seated in a small table, right in the middle of the floor, and it barely fit our plates and drinks on there, when there were other tables open. We ordered ice coffee so we had the coffee jug, the milk plate, our cups and our food plates on a teeny tiny table. I thought I was going to knock a plate over. Also since it was in the middle, my hat kept falling off the table because people would be walking by our table every 2 seconds.   Other than that I had a great time and I will be back!!",

I had a Denver omelet that I wanted mushrooms in, but wound up coming without...   overall, I give this place three stars because, despite our not-so-good server, the manager was extremely hospitable and friendly. being in the industry, my best friend and I don't really ask for much when it comes to dining out because of our own personal experiences with difficult guests, but the server totally forgot our add-ons to the food, lacked attention to see if anything was ok, and pretty much came to drop the check and asked if everything was good when the meal was done. the least he could have done, was apologize for forgetting things, but due to his lack of attention the experience was kind of droll. food was ok. but, I doubt we will be recommending this place overall. the manager's name is jasmine I believe. great job miss! you are super sweet and because of you alone, we might give this place another chance in the far future.",

What should have been a completely free meal ended up costing us $5. Not a huge issue but worth mentioning so people don't assume a gift card can be used for everything. Otherwise great experience!",

I gave my order, received my food and ate, and yet never was the seat next to me cleaned or wiped down. The two buspersons I noticed working there were busy (a Latin gentleman and young lady), but lots of servers and runners were standing around scratching their arses. I could hear the bull session in the kitchen from my counter seat.   Also maddening at EW is that management makes their staff marry their ketchups, which is common practice though still a health code violation, and foremost disgusting. Marrying ketchups means that contents from half empty bottles are combined. This practice saves restaurants money but the downside is that expired ketchup can live on in perpetuity. I knew this to be the case because when I squeezed some ketchup onto my plate, feculent bubbling ketchup water emerged.   The last thing that bothers me about EW is that they don't allow the servers to be cashiers, and often the line is 10-15 minutes to pay when they're busy. EW doesn't trust the servers to be cashiers for fear they'll flip checks and bilk pocket cash tables. Rather hypocritical given that management has no issue exposing EW customers to various foodborne illnesses via the ketchup scam. \"How was your meal?\" \"Fine except for ketchup trauma and the year of my life I lost waiting to pay the bill\"  PS: The last negative Yelp review I posted for EW was deleted. I guess they're messing with more than just the ketchup.",

    "text": "If I could write a review and give 0 stars, I would. We just moved to this side of town and we were beyond happy that we were still close to an EggWorks. (We use to frequent Sunset/Eastern)  We went for Sunday \"brunch\". My daughter ordered the Mouse Pancake and as a lover of blueberries ordered some on the side.  Our orders came out, we were starving. My daughter ate a blueberry out of the bowl they had given her, and it was then that we noticed the MOLD all over the blueberries, and upon further inspection, the blueberries underneath were mush and shriveled.  I alerted my server who took them into the back and asked if we wanted a different kind of fruit, I did not. At this point I was so appalled by what had happened I just wanted my family to eat and leave. It took 15minutes for what I am assuming was a manager to come to our table and apologize. They then stated they took the blueberries off our bill (a whole $1.75) and again asked if I wanted a different kind of fruit. They then let me know that they threw all the blueberries out and would order new. 5 mins later our server brought out a loaf of banana bread that was \"on the house\". We got our check and as we prepared to leave, to my horror, I saw a server bringing out 2 plates stacked with blueberry pancakes. I will NEVER be back. In what universe does a free loaf of banana bread fix the fact that you tried to serve my child MOLDY FRUIT??! Her absolute favorite thing is fresh blueberries. She wouldn't even taste her pancake because they had put a \"face\" of blueberries on that as well. $40 spent for the worst breakfast experience I have ever had. I'm sure Brad Burdsall wouldn't be okay with any of this.",

My veggie skillet was fine, but the eggs Benny that was ordered wasn't.  Eggs were cold and the bread was soggy underneath.  Potatoes also weren't as ordered (wanted only light seasoning).  Server was good about it all.  Didn't wanna take a chance on having a repeat issue, so we put in for a half omelette instead.  Waited 15 minutes and nothing came, which is odd since it takes about two minutes to make.  Server eventually came back and apologized and said health department was there, so that's why it was taking longer, but we know that doesn't usually impact service to any great degree unless issues are present.  We decided we had enough at that point and asked for the bill and one of the managers came over and gave us the bill for the  skillet and a half hearted apology.  Server came back again and apologized further (she was really nice) and gave us a soft drink and muffins to go, since one of us didn't eat (which was nice of her to do).  So while the server was good, I'm not sure that's enough to get us to try this place again.  3 stars due to my skillet being ok and the server being good.",

Place is easy to find, lots of parking and we went in the morning on Labor Day. No wait! Walked in and there is a cute train that goes around inside (loved it!) then awesome music since I love country, very cute atmosphere inside. Hostess and waiter was very nice as well with great attitude.   Food was not to die for me that is, I had the French toast. It was ok :( and my husband had a skillet (he loved it) and my friend had the banana bread French toast (she loved it) but her pouch egg was way too watery. Her husband had the mash potato omelet he also loved his food. So I will try it again but something else ;-)",

Which is an awesome wait time for such a busy restaurant. My name was called, Kat! Party of 3! We walked to the booth seeing that they had taken someone else by the name of Catalina and not Kat. Being swooped on our table for Catalina party of 2. Yes party of 2 was the first clue that the wrong person was called. They said that this has never happened and didn't know how you react to it. Best thing they should've done was go back to her table and apologize and say that it's Kat party of 3 that was called . Knowing her party had just gotten to the restaurant... Instead we waited for another 10mins for a table to be cleared while they called me Catalina to be seated.  The one star goes to being called another persons name.  The food review will come later..",

There was a gentleman who asked me for my info right away and then there was a young man seating people named Tyler. Tyler had two people walk in that he knows and immediately asked them if they wanted to sit outside to get seated quickly. My fiance, my daughter (in a stroller) and I were also waiting to be seated outside. My fiance stood up and asked him to make sure he still had us on the list and he said, yes. Then, he welcomed his friends again as if he didn't know who they were. It's one thing to wait because of business, I understand that. But watching the host try to seat the people he knows first is a little degrading.",

I suggest going BEFORE you are hungry, because you'll definitely have an appetite by the time your table is ready.  Luckily, there isn't usually a wait to sit at the counter, so that's what my boyfriend and I did when we went on a Saturday morning.  Why only 3 stars? Some of you may hate me for saying this - but it's because of their lack of decent hashbrowns. They have potatoes, and although they are tasty, it's not what I like. They do offer a hashbrown option, but they look like what you get from McDonald's and not the shredded potatoes I prefer. Additionally, I like my eggs runny, and I ordered them over easy. They came out over hard with no yolk at all and that is quite disappointing.  I ordered the CFS and it was very tasty. My boyfriend had an omelette with basically the kitchen sink in it and he loved it.  Overall, the service was fast and friendly and I will definitely go back - hopefully on a day when I can try their blood mary mix or a michelada!",

My partner and I have tried several breakfast spots in this general southeast side of Vegas over the past few months. Most have been fairly average. With just one visit Egg Works became my favorite. It has a very Hawaiian feel which I love, that's the food and the Aloha.   The food and preparation are very high quality. I had the Stuffed French Toast sandwich and loved it. Just so much food though. Very filling. Next time I will order a 1/2 order which I understand is available with quite a few items on the menu. Perfect!!  The Banana Bread Muffin is one of the best I've had. I don't say that lightly, my partner and I have sampled much Banana Bread (and Shave Ice) when visiting Hawaii. It definitely instantly reminded me of Julia's on Maui.   They have a huge menu and I'm really looking forward to sampling more on my next visit.  Aloha and Mahalo to Nicki and Egg Works",

I find the Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes offered with most breakfasts to be too heavy on seasoning and very dry when all I want is some classic hash browns that I can season myself. Unfortunately that's not an option here. In addition, I ordered two eggs over easy and got what appeared to be poached eggs still dripping with water. If this is their version of over easy then my breakfast was even farther from the classic ones served at so many other places. So, with the above negatives and the fairly high prices I'm afraid I won't return soon.",

I would have been happy with I am sorry   I can get you another one.After the lecture I decided to just eat my my omelette without the muffin.My friend who was treating me couldn't believe it so he left a small tip.Im from the service industry also and i would have not served the muffin in the first place. Sorry I'm going back to the one in Sunset.",

Each with way too much food for a normal person. The omelette came with a banana muffins. It was very moist, boy was it good. The French toast was so large that if my friends have not eaten for a week he still wouldn't have been able to finish it. And it was delicious. There were two pieces of French toast with a scrambled egg in the middle. My omelette was just the right amount of food. It has a mixture of veggies and chicken with that melted cheese on top. Again absolutely delicious. I recommend coming in hungry and splitting the meal with someone else because otherwise it's way too much food. And the service couldn't be beat. The servers share a table so whenever you need something, you flip a little token on the table and a server comes over immediately and takes care of you need.",

I ordered a club ranch wrap without tomatoes.  It was a lot of food but I didn't care much for the cheese or the ranch dressing, too runny and sour.  Two members of my party ordered the BLTs and we're happy.  The BLTs had a ton of bacon on them.  Another member of our party had the pancakes and we both thought they tasted more like KFC biscuits than pancakes.  Lastly, someone had the cheeseburger and they thought it was awful.  They said it tasted like they put chopped onions and oatmeal or some other type of filler in it.  They may serve up a mean egg breakfast, but I don't think I'll be going back to find out.",

Also you can order half size orders if you don't want the humongous portions that they serve. The coffee is okay (I'm a snob though) but \"okay\" is better than the other crap they serve anywhere else. Plus you get your own thermos of it so you don't wait for refills.

We were seated by the kitchen and I can hear her yelling at people. I know it was here because it stopped when she left and started when she went back. The worse part is that she may have been a manager since she had a different shirt on then everyone else. Which sucks because she probably won't even be held accountable.

I also appreciate that they're open at 6am, convenient for those of us unfortunate enough to have to be at work really early.  First off: banana muffin is probably the best thing they make - definitely try it.  I tend to stick with the skillets here, not least because they offer so many varieties - but the omelets aren't bad either (perhaps ironically, IMO far better cooked than the ones at Omelet House). These come really cheesy, which makes me a fan. The only thing I don't like about the skillets is that sometimes I'll find random ingredients in there that aren't listed as being in there on the menu. Kinda makes me wonder what they're doing back in the kitchen...  Also, def skip the hash browns. They look like McDonald's hash browns and somehow manage to taste far worse.",

Something that struck me as very positive here, they had a super clean women's restroom. The large stall actually had a baby changing area, and sink, right in there. It was so convenient since we were traveling with an infant.   Nice to know this place is family friendly and hits all the check marks on our list for a good breakfast/lunch stop.

Our food is always warm and prepared accurately with the exception of today, the cute server just completely had a brain fart and wrote the wrong Eggs Benedict down, but promptly fixed the mess: It feels like home in there and I take everyone who visits me because I know the quality and price are way better then the few competitors near by.",

I found the sausage to be better than I have had in years. I had to request plain French toast because the ones on the menu are fancy.

    "text": "I somehow end up here once every three months because of how consistently good it is!   I usually change up my order but two items that are a definite must have every time I go: banana muffin and the breakfast potatoes.   The banana muffin is free if you check into Yelp (& the servers are aware of it!) and it's great. The texture is great and you can taste the flavor evenly through.   The breakfast potatoes have a seasoning that just helps balance out the meal. I have never been disappointed with the potatoes!  I recently got the banana bread french toast, which was amazing. Just like the muffin, the texture is perfect for a french toast breakfast item and the flavor is consistent all the way through.  The weekends get super busy here, so I suggest coming early if you're not into waiting!",

This is a great spot to hit up if you're on a Vegas trip, like my brother & I were.  I don't write reviews very often, but I had to this time around because of the waitress that served us. She gave the gold standard of customer service that is a rarity these days & I don't actually know why that's the case. Genuinely warm & friendly is how I would describe Robin. Thank you for the experience, my dear! Hopefully we'll see you next time! You made my brother & I very happy.",

    "text": "I've done Cracked Egg, Broken Yolk in CA, and now Egg Works.  Yes...this was my first time to an Egg Works. I even had the Egg and I bookmarked for quite some time. It's taken me so long to try Egg Works/The Egg and I because the wait was always too long. I was fortunate one Sunday morning to check out this new location in Henderson with a group of BPF's (Best Peeps Forever).  And for an added bonus, the wait was only 20 minutes.  Not bad for a new breakfast hot spot. Not bad for a Sunday morning.   Besides lunch and dinner, breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.  And when it comes to breakfast at a place like this, my order is usually as boring as it gets. I usually get some type of omelet or anything with eggs.  You can't eat at a place named Egg Works for the first time and not have their eggs. I had them create an 6 egg white omelet with spinach & mushrooms.  For an added touch, I had 3 strips of turkey bacon added.  Let me say that this meal was so good that I felt I just had a cheat meal. The omelet was fluffy and tasty, but the it's the mushrooms that was the key to adding flavor to it. Egg Works has more than just eggs and omelets like country fried steaks, chili spaghetti, waffles, and pancakes.  I just didn't get the opportunity on this trip.  And by the way, the prices here are pretty good too.   Like I stated earlier, the wait wasn't too long even though this joint was packed. The service was great and our waiter was very attentive.  When you're done, follow the foot prints on the floor to the register.    Extra, Extra...Read All About It. If you're a newbie to Egg Works or the Egg and I, you'll notice that the menus are in the form of a newspaper.  Extra, Extra...Read All About It.  Look around when once you're seated. You'll notice that since the menu is set up like a newspaper, a handful of patrons read the menu like it's a newspaper.  Just an observation...Ha.

When we arrived we had about a 15 minute wait, no problem even though we could see there were empty tables that needed bussed.  When the four of us we were seated the table was short two utensil set ups and the hostess said she would be right back with them.  She was not!  So the waitress took our drink orders and cane back we again asked for utensils.  She then returned and took our order no utensils.  I then went to the hostess station and got the utensils myself.  When are food was served the toast was with the wrong order at least it was there.  The ketchup had one squirt left in it as did the adjoining tables, LOL.  Keeping in good spirits throughout this as the food was good as always.  Upon checking out the cashier swiped our debit card and said it didn't go through.  He swiped it again it said it was declined.  We then used a credit card and completed our transaction.  After we left we received a notification from our bank for a report of suspicious activity.  The first charge did go through and the kid didn't catch it.  Now we are double charged and straightening it out with our bank.  I dont know who the manager is at this place and i hope they were just having an off day.  We will see.",

We waited about 20 minutes for a party of four, which I suppose isn't too bad for that time of day.  There were people waiting to be seated the whole time we were there; business is good at Egg Works!  This is a local chain and a decent option to go for eggs, omelettes, pancakes, waffles, as well as chili; yes, they have Cincy Chili on the menu.  Unfortunately, I didn't have anything too exciting except a 6 egg-white omelette with mushrooms and spinach and three slices of limp turkey bacon.  It was okay, but if I have the choice for breakfast, this isn't my first one.  If you go on the weekends like we did, just be ready to wait a bit. Open until 3:00pm.",

The restaurant is clean and well kept, except for the occasional baby in a high chair who drops food all over the floor. That just shows bad parenting but that's a whole different topic. We are always seated promptly and our drinks are at our table before we even have a chance to look at the menu. Our server has been Jill and she's awesome. She noticed John was wearing an A's baseball hat and instantly was able to strike up a conversation with us. She has remembered us and is friendly every time. Thanks Jill!!   The food is pretty good. Typical breakfast joint. I always get the eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side. I don't like the muffin underneath to be soggy so I just like to dip instead. So good and fulfilling. The omelettes are also very good. Huge and stuffed with anything and everything you can imagine. And everything is reasonably priced. They also offer lunch  options. Depending on what you order, you're looking at about $25 for two people.   Will I be back? Definitely, every Wednesday!!",

    "text": "We stopped in for a 'I'm skipping yoga today so lets go get breakfast'.  :-)   This place was hopping! It was around 9am so I was anticipating that.  I was keeping my fingers crossed for a short wait time.  Luckily it was only 5 minutes and I actually think we waited less than that. The place itself has many many tables inside and also an outdoor patio seating for those nice Vegas days.    One of the ladies came over right away to get our drink order.  Turns out she wasn't our waitress so it was nice that they all chip in a help each other out.  I'm sure they know people love their morning coffee as soon as they can get it!   Since i ordered coffee, she left a full carafe with us.  This is great since i drink coffee quickly.  Shortly after our actual waitress came to take our order.  I decided on the Country Benny and the hubs went with the breakfast burrito.    Food is here already??!   It came out quickly, which makes me happy (and my stomach!).   The country benny was great! Biscuit layered with sausage, eggs and topped with country gravy.  Can you feel the calories? It was a great combination of breakfast items topped with a very flavorful gravy.  My only issue was the sausage used.  Almost seemed like it was microwaved for 10 seconds.  Hmmm.  But the rest of the dish was wonderful.   My husband's burrito was fabulous.  I had a little taste and wished I had ordered that.  It was filled with eggs, bacon, potatoes, onions and cheese.  Salsa was on the side.  The burrito was huge and was surprised he finished it all!    Both of our meals had a side of breakfast potatoes.  When I say a side...  I mean a heaping pile of Idaho!   I think we could have split one side for the two of us.  They were fantastic.  Crispy with a great seasoning of YUM.    What I thought was cute was their little black or yellow eggs faces on the tables.  You can change it to yellow when you need attention at your table.   It beats trying to wave down a waitress.    Per my check in - I was Egg-cited to try it and happy we did!  We had so much for breakfast we were full until dinner.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!...   Someone at a close table ordered blueberry pancakes and they looked amazing!  Think that will be next!",

The staff is very friendly(the waitress remember us from the other day) and the food comes out within a reasonable amount of time regardless if it's busy or not. Of course the busier times tend to be in the morning early afternoon. If you go after 1pm it's dead and you get a table right away. The menu contains a large variety of choices from classic favorites and eggs Benedict to omelettes and skillets and pancakes even Hawaiian style options like \"loco moco\" and \"spam n eggs\". Every time I come here I try to get something different today we went with \"the works breakfast skillet\" that was amazing!! The base was a bed of egg works signature potatoes seasoned with diablo spices, mixed with bacon, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, onion, cheese and tomatoes topped with over easy eggs. We also ordered the \"spinach Benedict\" a nice classic Benny with poached eggs, Canadian bacon and spinach topped with hollandaise sauce. We even got a free banana nut muffin for checking in on yelp. Definitely the place to go in Vegas!!! And the cost is so good for how much food you get. Makes it so worth it.",

I had the stuffed French toast and tried an omelet as well the first day. The stuffed drenched toasted was not stuffed it was simply a ton of cream cheese and strawberry jelly smothering both breads in the middle and on top. The omelette was greasy and their \"diablo \" spice is  a weird mix of spice and sugar. Today we tried banana and chocolate pancake and the Cabo burrito. The waitress forgot to put in pancake order (it happens )  they quickly brought it out and it was under cooked to the point where you could see the pancake mix. The burrito was also very greasy. However the potatoes without the spice were good.  After leaving both days my stomach started hurt and needless to say the food didn't sit well In my stomach. I read reviews on this place, but after going twice and trying 4 different meals mediocre food and service is an understatement. My teenager can cook a better meal. Will not be going back.",

I don't even like bananas and couldn't stop eating these!  Very nice servers that are very attentive. Good family environment as well.

    "text": "This place is packed, but they manage to provide good service to each and every single patron.  That's what I would like to think at least.    I had the Plain chicken sandwich, served with potatoes.  My chicken was moist and potatoes were a bit salty, but filling as always.  I like their fruit options, because it's always seasonal fruit that they offer.    This place is like an All-American breakfast joint, with my favorite Hawaiian flare options.  For whatever reason, they usually forget my muffin, but they always make up for it by giving me an extra one.  It's the best I've ever had, in my opinion.  The muffins are fresh, super moist, not too overly sweet and just addictive.",

Not only is the food delicious and good priced, the service was amazing from our friendly server Heather.   I totally recommend this place to everyone and anyone wanting to eat breakfast. Today i had the crazy chicken omelette and their signature potatoes. The crazy chicken omelette has chicken, avocado, mushrooms and cheese. It's delicious for us non-pork eating people.   The service here is very efficient as well. Seating is quick and service is even quicker. When you're finished eating, you simply pay at the cashier located in the front, thereby freeing up tables quicker for others to sit.",

It was fluffier than I can make myself at home.  I like how they allowed sliced tomatoes as an alternative to home fries.  When you order an omelet, you are usually avoiding refined carbs anyway.  My server was very attentive and got me exactly what I ordered.  The only negative is that we felt rushed.  I understand that they need to turn the tables quickly, but putting the check on my table when I just got the meal is too rushed for me.  After a long wait, I don't want the meal to be over in 20 minutes.",

Keeps you entertained while waiting for your name to be called. During our visit, we tried their regular egg burrito, avocado omelet, chicken fried steak, and beef burrito. They were all delicious and yummy. I jokingly made a comment about the sauce tasting like Taco Bell but was told by my companion that it might taste like Taco Bell but it is fresh. The portions are big, I can stay a two person can split it and still be full. They give a lot of potatoes on each of our plates. We did not finish it all. Also, their banana nut muffin is great! I could come to this place and just eat that! If you are wanting huge delicious breakfast and in the area, I recommend trying this place out.",

The breakfast menu offers something for everyone. Egg dishes, waffles, pancakes, french toast, skillets, omelets and even some Hawaiian favorites like loco moco. This is not a place for those on a diet, the portions are huge. Most egg dishes were made with 4 eggs so take your cholesterol meds.   We went with the cabo breakfast burrito (plenty for 2 to share) and the bacon maple stuffed french toast. The burrito was huge and came with their habla diablo potatoes which are a little on the spicy side. The french toast was stuffed with bacon and maple flavored cream cheese and topped with pecans. Both were very good.   Service started off a little slow with waiting quite some time for our order to be taken as well as for our food. This will be a definite return for me with so many different options to try.",

We ordered the waffle with strawberries/whip...on the side, turkey sausage and potatoes and the seasoned Chix omelette. It was okay overall. The service was good. They have this egg that you flip if you need service...happy face means you're good, frown means you need service. I felt weird flipping to the frown; b/c I wasn't unhappy, just wanted to add something to my order. Oh and they have a bar and approx 4-5 big screen tvs!",

I love that they offer buckwheat.  I swear it is a True super food, and I've seen some nice growth in my legs after consuming these for postworkout carbs on leg day.  I've had the blueberry buckwheat pancakes and diced apple/cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.  If you like buckwheat, they are great. I could even eat them without the sugar free syrup. I really love them.  For me, the banana nut muffin lives up to the hype.  It's just as good as it looks and it's as good as any good review says it is.  I cannot, however, speak on anything else on the menu. Go buckwheat!",

Came here for lunch on a Thursday and one of my favorite spots. Today the service was lacking. Whoever the male hostess was, was not only rude but impersonal. Didn't greet us and walked us to the table and dropped off menus and walked away before we even sat. He did that with several tables around us. Didn't let us know who our server was... it took ten minutes for a server to get to us. I'm fine with that when it's busy but they weren't busy because it was later in the afternoon. Usually really love the service and food and today was not a good day for them.",

I'm from Cincinnati and I've been to Camp Washington, Dixie, and grew up on Gold Star and Skyline... This stuff at Egg Works is just wrong.  Second, our waitress, Jennifer, was a dud. She never cleared our over crowded two person table until after our meal and didn't give a crap about whether we were enjoying our food or not. She kept saying she would bring us water, but would forget over an extended amount of time.  I ordered the Country Benny and was not impressed (go to the Cracked Egg for a better version). My companion ordered the Santa Cruz burrito, which looked good, but was not Jessica-friendly (onions galore), so I abstained.

The place was packed, especially for late Friday morning.  Does anyone work?  I know I don't, but geez, where did all of these people come from?  And dressed like they just rolled out of bed or were going to go wash their cars after getting a bite.  It's a casual place.  The hostess was very pleasant, but it did take awhile for two of us (place a baby) to get seated.  There were tables vacant, but not cleared.  It took a bit of time before anyone came and cleared and set a table (they were very busy and busers were working hard, but maybe they needed more busers).  Took awhile before we saw our server.  He didn't seem too happy to wait on us.  We asked for a side of raisins for the baby and an order of unseasoned french fries.  We asked to have the raisins and french fries come out first.  He said he was going right then to get that raisins but that the french fires would have to come out with the omelette.  We did ask for the fries to be unseasoned, so maybe that added to the cook time, but what happened to getting kids' meals first (I don't see places doing this anymore)?  And a simple, I'm sorry, the fires will come out with the meal would have gone a long way.     We ordered the Bacon and Sliced Avocado omelette with sour cream on the side.  My girlfriend HATES sour cream and can't stand it anywhere near her food.  The food came, took longer than I would have liked or expected, and your guessed it, the sour cream was dolloped right on top and center of the omelette.  We were also not brought an extra plate despite stating that we were going to share a meal.  When we asked our server for another plate, once he finally re-appered, it seemed like a major inconvenience and like an over the top request to get an extra plate.  So, the omelette was pretty good, but no great shakes.  Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes, again, pretty good, but nothing special.  I did appreciate the cleanliness of the restaurant and it was noisy but not in a bad way (so very good to have a cranky baby with us).  Food was good quality and I liked the variety of the menu.  I noticed they had savory crepes and some Hawaiian dishes.  It was nice to see these.  The crepes looked fabulous, but I was disappointed that they did not offer any sweet or fruit crepes.  I will definitely go back and try some other times, but I am by no means rushing on in.",

I decided on the Country Fried Eggs and it was delicious!! The eggs were perfectly over-easy and their potatoes were season and deep fried.  There's enough food to feed two people if you're not that hungry.   Hands down, best part of our breakfast was our waiter PK!!

I like to taste eat nuance in food. Next time I'll ask for hollandaise on the side.  Their home fries are really good and its sprinkled with some paprika or something, but taste really good. The banana nut muffin you get for checking in is pretty good and I don't like banana nut stuff!",

I am not giving this place five stars for taste, decor, or any of the usual reasons. Weird, right? I know. Just go with it.  I am giving them five stars because of how successful Egg Works does their job. They serve great food, for great prices. I have never had any major issues with service. And this location has plenty of visible TV's to watch the game on Sundays.  What's not to love? I thought about giving them four stars because it's not like I come here and I'm blown away by the taste, or ingredients, wine list or Michelin stars. But what this place does, it does very well. If you want a hardy, filling breakfast for a no-nonsense price, then Egg Works achieves it every time.  The bf and I always come late, because we are not morning people. I have never had to wait when arriving between 11:30 and 3.",

They are really nice and friendly. Since it is a chain, I wouldn't really expect anything else.  Food - The food was decent. I just dinner think it was anything special. It reminded me of a Denny's or IHOP. I ordered the breakfast burrito - it was good. I lived in San Diego for 6 years before vegas, so I can be a little picky. The thing that for me the most were the potatoes. They definitely came out of a freezer box. I think they used the same ones my old catering company did.

We were greeted extremely politely and seated quickly (it was slightly busy). Our server was extra friendly and we immediately noticed the overall Fuck you bitch atmosphere of the restaurant. My wife, being from the Big Island of Hawai'i was excited to see that they offered a Loco moco, but she was also skeptical of ordering it being that we were in a restaurant named \"Egg Works\" in Henderson, NV. She ended up ordering it and was more than happy with what she received! I had an omelette or something simple and it was delicious. We are now regulars of this restaurant, for both breakfast and lunch. I have not had a bad experience yet and would recommend pretty much anything on the menu! I myself am not a fan of muffins, but my wife cannot stop talking about how phenomenal their muffins are, so if I had to recommend at least one thing, I guess it would be those!! The garlic toasted bread on the beef dip sandwich is also something to definitely try!! I would drive 20-25 miles to go to this restaurant!",

    "text": "Let me start this review by stating that I've had Eggworks over the years since 1999. Or was it 2000? Or both. And 2001 to beyond.   I worked across the street from The Egg & I on W. Sahara for years. And I always remembered their breakfast plates being one of my two favorite places to get a good, hearty meal early in the morning.  So my fiancee being the coupon saving woman she is, finds a BOGO up to $8 off. She's telling me she found a new place I never been to and I'm going to love it. Im getting jazzed about it, until she says we're going to Eggworks. I immediately let her know this new Eggworks off S. Eastern is an expansion of The Egg & I on W. Sahara. They've been in business over 30 years!  I loved my bacon, ham, and sausage skillet w/jack and cheddar cheese. My fiancee had the stuffed french toast w/bacon. Once again, I loved my plate. My skillet was cheesy, and with a bit of the verde green sauce on the table, I was happier than Michael Myers on Halloween! The portions were generous and satisfying, as well as the service. I felt the love in a packed restaurant as/choo-choo trains paced the perimeter of the establishment.   I would highly recommend Eggworks, or The Egg & I for a tasty, filling breakfast. The service is exceptional, considering I recently stopped by on a Saturday morning w/a 15 minute wait. That ended up being 8 minutes. And most importantly, the experience  was almost as good as my fiancee's bacon stuffed french toast. Damn that stuffed french toast was the ish!",

I would 100% recommend the French toast. It is light and fluffy, which makes it delicious! On top, there is powdered sugar with a side of maple syrup.      The next thing I would for sure recommend is the bacon. It is so crispy, and so good. It has a really nice flavor that, to me, is different than others.      How could I forget about the fried egg? A combination of French toast, bacon, and eggs is just something that is meant to be.      You should always order some plain white toast when coming here. Just spread some butter (and/or jam), and there you have it! Its saltiness compliments the French toast's sweetness.      The atmosphere is bright and  playful. They have a little train that goes around a track around the restaurant. It really boosts your mood when you see it head around the place.      Being clean is probably their thing considering their bathroom is spotless! You walk in there, and there is no dirt, no stains, and no splatters!      You should definitely come here for a good breakfast!",

The food was meh at best, however. There were random pieces of food thrown in my skillet that were not supposed to be there, my toast came out deformed and soggy while my friend's toast was burnt to a crisp. The skillet I ordered was alright, nothing great. Potatoes were good, the spinach and mushrooms were uncooked and annoying to eat, seemed like a rushed job. My friend ordered corn beef hash and he did not really love his either, ate only a few bites. Good thing the items were not very expensive. Probably will not be back, there are definitely better breakfast spots in the Anthem area!",

When I saw this place on Yelp, I knew I had to try it.  This place wasn't too hard to find on S Eastern Ave. It was on our way to The Hoover Dam. Once we got there, the workers were really nice. The restaurant was about half full so we got seated quickly. Our server brought us the menus and asked if it was our first time. We told her that it was and she promptly got us two banana nut muffins. The bread was warm and moist. I just slathered it with butter. It was yummy goodness.  It took a while to browse over the menu as it was quite extensive. I decided to stick with my tried and True, the Traditional Benny. Two grilled English muffins topped with Canadian bacon, with two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce. It came with a side of Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. How could you go wrong with this? Of course you can't. It tasted just as good as it sounds. The entree was huge. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise sauce didn't separate. The potatoes were so so. I like my potatoes crispy and this wasn't. I would have preferred crispy hash browns instead.  The hubby had some kind of turkey skillet breakfast. Turkey is not listed on the menu for the skillets. If you ask for it, they can make it. He really enjoyed it. I never got a chance to taste it. I was busy working on my own plate. I couldn't finish, so he ate my other benny muffin.",

As a person who has been in customer service for almost 20 years she really knows her stuff. She made it a point to bring us that wonderful yummy muffin free of charge because we were first time guests. She also mentioned you have large portions of food which prompted us to share the works omelet. Best omelet I've ever had, I couldnt stop eating. The food and service were spectacular. As a server Tina hit every point she was suppose to. She even pushed the table next to us up to ours so we would have more room taking a potential tip away from herself. That my friends is excellent customer service. Thank you again Tina for a job well done. We will definitely be back.",

We looked at each other and said I hope he's NOT our waiter. Wrong, he was. He returned with the water and said are you ready GUYS? WE only found his name out because he told the \"guys\" (which was a table of 4 ladies) behind us it was \"pK\". We must of heard him say guys 35 times while we were there. Ok FOOD..'... that was brought out by someone else, no biggie. $9.95 for a club additional $1.95 for it to come on a croissant. No mayo, mustard nothing. It looked AWESOME. But was dry. And the heart skillet something, was just that. Something! So so gravy oily potatoes. We only ate half of both. Our waiter returned NEVER ASKED IF THINGS WERE OK? Just said once again, \"here guys, thanks guys\" dropping the bill. We didn't even know to pay up front. We will NOT return!! Thanks \"Paul\" \"pK\" and the kitchen staff for a not so nice Valentine's day treat.",

As for the food, there's a reason why this is my favorite breakfast place. Whether I'm in the mood for decadent comfort food (the homemade Corn Beef Hash is freaky good) or trying to be good (Greek Scramble with egg whites only is awesome too), I love the food here. Any of the egg dishes can be made with egg whites if preferred, and they have two different fruit medleys available if you don't want the potatoes.  Predictably, it's a bit of a zoo on weekends, and you'll have a bit of a wait on those days, but it's well worth it in my opinion.",

    "text": "After driving around the area looking for a breakfast spot, we decided on coming to Egg Works.  It was my first time and I really enjoyed my food.  Upon walking in, I was taken aback by the decor.  It seemed a bit dark and cluttered with a bunch of random images of eggs throughout the restaurant.  There were TV's around the area as well.  Got seated and the waitress provided us with menus and asked for our drinks.  Looked at the menu (which is in a newspaper format - pretty creative) and was overwhelmed by the amount of breakfast items on the menu.  Took me about 10 minutes to decide on a dish.  Ended up getting the california crepe.  The crepe was thin and had a good proportion of egg to meats.  The avocado was the kicker.  I tend to order due to specific items within the dish and the avocado really made it taste great. (of course, the bacon helped as well).  Other dishes our group ordered included the loco moco, which was a bit salty and the banana nut french toast, which was very very (maybe too) moist.  One thing I did notice was that they had great servers and they had a little paddle on each table that lets you indirectly ask for the servers to come.  It seemed pretty creative as well but probably not utilized as often since it is just easier to ask for a server.  I want to come back and try the other items.  The food is pretty good and it seems to be very popular so maybe there are better items on the vast menu that I can order.",

This is a truly homey-feeling place which is close to home and will become a frequent eatery for this patron.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time today. My mom ordered an omelet, and I ordered a Loco Motion. Hamburger patty with sticky rice, 2 eggs and brown gravy. I ordered my eggs poached, and my patty medium rare.  The food came out quite quickly, and our waitress was kind.  My mom liked her omelet, and I thought that my patty was a little over cooked, but it was still good. However, it almost tasted like they cooked it in A-1 steak sauce, and it was kind of clashing with the gravy. My eggs were cooked nicely. It came with pineapple, but I was disappointed with that. It was not ripe, and more white than yellow. I chose a banana muffin instead of toast.  My daughter and I ate it, but it left my fingers greasy.... Not something a muffin should do.  The women's bathroom was gross.  There was only one clean stall.  The first stall closest to the sink couldn't be opened. The middle stall was clean,  the third, and final (only handicapped stall) had fecal matter in the bowl,  and paper on the floor.  I looked on the rest room sheet, and no one had been in there or signed off on their cleaning duties since 8/4 (yesterday). Kind of a mood kill.",

And I really like that you can get different sides besides the potatoes. I'm not a huge potato fan at breakfast, so I always get cottage cheese and there is no extra charge! BONUS!! Alexa is a wonderful server. She kept our drinks full and even gave me a Diet Coke to go too!!! This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Henderson!!",

I've been back quite a few times after bf introduced me to this place (it's arguable that's how he trapped me in the first place). Everything I've had here has been either good or great. It's a solid breakfast/brunch place.   I think my favorites that I've tried so far is probably the Loco Moco (I crave this stuff... I've tried quite a few and this is probably the best!) and the blackened prime rib eggs benny. YUM! YUM! YUM!",

Our server was quick, efficient, and still very friendly! I could tell the staff was superb, by the family sitting next to us. Pretty much we knew they were regulars by everyone in the restaurant coming to greet them and congratulate them on their good news! The server had a great attitude and did her job well, even though I knew she was busy it didnt show the slightest!

We met my parents there who said they didn't have to wait for a table at all, score!  They have cute menus that look like mini newspapers and a huge selection of breakfast items!  Each page more delicious-sounding than the last!  I opted for the veggie egg crepe (yes that's right CREPE) because guess what? This item isn't made like a desserty crepe, it's a crepe made from EGG which makes it healthy and filling. The crepe was filled with spinach, mushrooms, cheddar (i swapped it for the Swiss) and guacamole and it was delicious. They served it with a side of Italian dressing but I liked it better with ketchup, but that's just me. It also came with really good potatoes that were seasoned with paprika or seasoned salt which was great.   Oh and I forgot to mention two things. 1.  It also came with this yummy banana muffin (almost like an appetizer) and 2.  Each dish can be made as a half size order which is more than filling.   My dad had The Works which he said was \"fabulous\" and my mom had their Greek scramble but had them turn it into an omelette. My sister got their stuffed French toast which just looked fancy delish.   Also special shout out to the staff there who extremely attentive and friendly. I really can't find any flaws and will definitely go back there again!",

I've been there several times and it seems like a server is always trying to help the hostess figure out a confusing. We waited 20 mins longer than she quoted us. Another thing I don't like is there is literally not one thing on the menu that isn't full of fat and calories other than the oatmeal I think. Most restaurants give a heathy option area or at least 2-3 choices of a lower calorie meal. We won't go back again for that reason. But don't worry about my review a lot of people love this place and like I said it's always packed",

We have tried it three or four times.  We have not been here for a couple of months.    Oh my, how fast it has become a has been.  No more tries at this particular site.    One order was wrong and the waitress was admittedly 'sorry', enough to offer to 'take care of it' without us asking.  Her idea of taking care of the matter  was to write a note on the ticket \"Wrong omelet, but ate anyways\"... it was half eaten because we were looking for the ham, when we realized it was a mistake we notified the waitress, who did little but write a very rude note and attach it to our check.    The other order was served incorrectly also, but- with much delay- corrected.  We left without finishing half of either meal.  We left a small tip anyways for a small effort.  The cheery serving staff that was here at the opening has left behind a rather bland, unpleasant staff that is only half interested in making this site as homey as other ones.    With so many offerings in the Las Vegas area for breakfast, it would be a better experience to give your business to a nearby alternative, in fact, any nearby alternative.",

However today just one bad employee and make my experience upside down.  Everything was good until I when to paid my bill. As usual I used coupon and paid with my credit card and I knew Egg Work require the cashier to check ID for all credit card pays. The cashier (Alice or Alicia) once she saw my credit card she asked for my ID. Here came to the problem, I remove my ID and hold it to show her, instead reviewing my ID. She just so busies doing something else and I was holding my ID about a minute and I though by now she should had enough time to review my ID. Than I put my ID away, by than she raise her head and tell me she did not see my ID yet. (Giving me a facial sour attitudes), I was very offended by her attitudes. I told her I was holding my ID about a minute for you to review it, and she reply with her attitudes \" I am busy doing your coupon\". At this point I did not want to continue the conversation, I just sign my credit card bill and left. And I was so unhappy her attitude and I forgot to give tips to my wait staff. When I realize it I stop my car and walk back inside the restaurant to pay the tips to wait staff.",

Anyways, menus are pretty nifty like newspapers. Egg decor all around, gives you the farm style feeling, liked it. Food was delicious, just a little too much cheese on omelettes. Chili relleno, crazy chicken, and strawberry cream cheese French toast all a must try. Debra ( Deborah?) our server was DELIGHTFUL & on point, never had to ask for refills, or extra napkins she was always right there when we needed her. She was very helpful in answering all of our questions.  Overall great visit, we will be back!",

Other items looked just as bad. The lady sitting nest to me had the taco salad and the smell of the canned salsa made me nauseous.  The \"good ole tymie\" decor added inslult to injury.

When I asked our waitperson, Rita, to make sure the beef patty was not overcooked, she assured me she knew exactly what I wanted and would tell the chef/cook to prepare it that way.    Boy, she was right!  The burger patty, when I barely cut into it with my fork, melted into perfectly cooked rice & blended with a dark, rich gravy in a way I've never had before!  I've had this dish in Hawaiian restaurants and none came close to the perfection of this one today.    I thank Rita for making sure my Loco Moco was the best...EVER!",

Being Mother's Day, we expected the place to be crowded and kinda expected a bit of a wait for a table. Surprisingly, we ended up getting a seat pretty quickly. The servers were great and the food was excellent! But the main reason why I give this place 5 stars is because of a particular moment involving the servers and management! Again, being Mother's Day, we expected a bit of a wait for our food which was absolutely fine because we were in no rush. After ordering our food, my girlfriend's parents' food came out pretty fast but my girlfriend and I's food took a little longer. Like I said, we were in no rush so we were totally fine with waiting on food because the place was absolutely packed but our server kept coming over and apologizing that we didn't have our food yet. Once our food did come out, our server apologized again. And then while we were eating this delicious food, a manager came over and apologized once more about the wait and ever gave us 50% off our bill. I don't know if it was because of Mother's Day or this is how the treat all of their customers but I was beyond satisfied with this place and have been recommending Egg Works to everyone since then!",

Instead I got a very large and thick omelet that contained mounds of stuff.  I ate small portions of the egg because it was too greasy for me. The cubed potatoes were flavorful and crispy.  But don't let the \"crepes\" description fool you. It's an omelet. A really, big and thick omelet.",

Today we are sitting outside.  I should have worn sunglasses. No spectacular view, just the parking lot and cars on Eastern Ave. the radio is on the speakers. The sun feels nice with the cold air. The menu is in news paper fashion. I had apple juice and a breakfast burrito with egg whites and a side of sour cream.  I would give the food 3 stars.  Our server has the same name as me. She was very nice and attentive like all the servers I have had here.  They have an egg that you flip to alert for service, but I haven't ever needed to use it. They have a good variety on their menu and it is one place that I can order something different every time. For two of us our check came out to $22.",

I'm not the usual person that likes to try new things when I go to similar places, I always order the same thing over & over. But it was actually worth the change. It was delicious!

They have a good vanilla cappuccino - I think it's the one that's similar to the ones they have at gas stations, but it's still really good.  The banana nut muffin is so good! So soft and flavorful. It usually comes w the meals, I believe. I always order spam and rice. That's why I love this place - allergic to eggs and don't really like bfast foods, so SPAM it is. They give you two pretty big cuts of spam and really good, soft white rice. It comes w eggs but I always sub it for some fruit.  My son, always orders pancakes from the kids menu. You get a free drink and a huge pancake along w either bacon or sausage - all for under 5 bucks.   I think this is just a great establishment. Nice staff. Good bfast food.

It was the best I've ever had. It came with breakfast potatoes, eggs and toast/muffin. The banana nut muffin was worth going back for, just on its own. My hubby ordered the loco moco. The burger was cooked perfectly, the gravy was great, and it came with all the same sides as the corned beef hash. He can't go on enough about it. We also ordered a stack of original pancakes, and they were amazing as well. It was more than enough food! We will definitely be returning! I suggest everyone try this place out at least once.",

But there are a few exceptions and this is one of them.  Our waiter, Manny gave excellent customer service, was very friendly, patient and explained the menu items to us.  The whole restaurant has the home town vibe and is very welcoming.  They have a cute system where if you need something, you turn a tag to the unhappy face.  For the food, this is an excellent breakfast spread.  Be careful when ordering, these are big portions.  The breakfast burrito is a classic dish with beans, eggs, and your choice of protein.  They give tons of potatoes.  The skillets are offered every way you can imagine.  We could barely finish the half order, imagine how a full order would look like.  The total bill for three of us was a tad of $30, it's a great deal.  Recommended.",

I ordered pork carnitas Benedict. My eggs were over cooked and not runny whatsoever the way eggs Benedict is supposed to be.  The hollandaise sauce tasted canned. I had originally wanted hash browns instead of their \"home fries\" and when I asked for that the waitress said they're frozen patties \"like McDonald's\" (her words). Gross, so I went with their diablo potatoes which were seriously those frozen reheated potatoes with their special blend of spices thrown on there. Not fresh whatsoever. I ordered a side of guacamole - wasn't guac - it was mashed up avocado with no additional spices.   My fiance ordered a NY steak and eggs. His eggs were cooked right - but steak was previously frozen and not fresh. Was not medium rare - more like medium well.   The reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the service was good and the waitress was attentive. Breakfast is not hard to get right, and I'm disappointed. We won't be back.",

Parking lot is shared with a church so I am going to assume that sSundays may be busy.  First off, if you check in, you can get a banana nut muffin for free :)  The Santa Cruz Burrito- a mexican fusion breakfast burrito! The santa cruz sauce is delicious. I felt like i was eating a homemade breakfast chimchanga. Its pretty heavy so I only ate half but I'M SO EXCITED FOR MY LEFTOVERS. 4 eggs+chorizo+CHICKEN. Thats basically triple meat... need i say more? It comes with potatoes  or mexican rice, my server let me get half potatoes and half fruit. I love her. The potatoes are actually like crispy potato blocks and they are seasoned for flavor.  A whole side of it is way too much for me. Highly advise for fruit, because it was delicious. Great way to balance a heavy burrito. 5/5 and would come back to try the cabo burrito. Even my boyfriend loved the burrito. The skillets look amazing, but if youre like my boyfriend and do NOT want a bunch of potatoes, try an omelette or something else instead. The italian skillet was beautiful and delicious, but the potatoes were a little too plentiful. Taste was great and the sunny side up eggs were perfect. Id give it a 3.5/5 because it paled in comparison to my burrito. :P E N J O Y",

Not sure if we've had her before, but she provided excellent service.  Both breakfasts were very tasty and, as always, enough for two breakfasts:  one day and leftovers tomorrow.    Large parking lot, reasonable prices, excellent service and good food.  Also, the restaurant is large so there is space between tables.  Some local breakfast places (such as New Day Cafe) have crammed as many tables into a smaller space as possible, making it overly warm inside and forcing guests to speak quietly or be overheard.  I love this space.  The restaurant feels spacious.  It is child-friendly.  The train running around the ceiling line is fun.  There is a small \"gift shop\" at the cash register where you can buy bread, spices and t-shirts.  The patio is pet friendly.  Not sure I'd particularly want to eat outside right next to Eastern Avenue, but if you want to take your dog with you to breakfast, then this is definitely the place for you.",

We were greeted by a friendly waitress named Patty whom took our beverage order. We chose coffee. She brought our coffee and water out quickly with flavored creamer for me-Hazelnut. Patty checked in a few times with us as we perused their extensive menu of breakfast and lunch offerings. I decided to order lunch, my husband ordered breakfast. Since he is writing a yelp review about his experience, this will be about my overall experience. I ordered the patty melt with seasoned fries and a pickle. Everything was delicious and hot. I think this is the fastest we've ever received our food-cooked to perfection. My patty melt was seasoned and prepared the way I like it. It had a lot yummy Swiss cheese between the rye bread. The fries were seasoned and crispy, the pickle delightful, it crunched when I bit into it.  Patty was delightful, friendly and helpful. She is an excellent waitress. Our hostesses and cashiers were friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was clean and organized. It's well run and the employees work as a team ensuring everyone is served well. I enjoyed my visit and food. I will return soon for breakfast.",

Price is on par with any brunch/breakfast place. I had the Mexican omelette, which was very flavorful. The eggs were not dry, unlike some chain breakfast places that I have been to. Waitress was on the dot with our coffee refills. Great place for kids, they have a toy train that goes around the dining area and also passes the waiting area. Would return for brunch during our next Vegas trip!",

    "text": "This place has a nice variety; you can get huevos rancheros, loco moco, eggs Benedict, or just bacon and eggs. Most dishes come with the option of seasoned potatoes which is their house-made cut potatoes with the Egg Works seasoning. I have to warn you; very addicting! My kids had no interest in them at all until I made them try them. Besides the potatoes, we go back for the friendly service. The food is consistent and so is the service which lends to the likeliness in why it's always busy, especially in the mornings on the weekends. Expect a wait of at least 15 minutes. I recommend letting them know if it's your first time, so they can tell you how to get their attention if you need anything! I'm probably here once or twice a month...and I live in Sacramento! :o",

We usually can't finish the whole meal but she told us that we can do half orders of most of the skillets and omelettes.  We had no idea about that and it is a great idea.  The food was delicious as usual and service as I said with Tina was great.  We can't wait to stop here when we don't want to cook.  Planning on asking for Tina every time we come!",

Food here is terrible. I ordered a bacon & cheese omelette with their home made banana nut muffin. Choice of DEEP FRIED potatoes of hash brown patties (2) or their DEEP Fried \"Works\" potatoes. Both are frozen. I chose the hash brown potato.  The muffin came first, it was small and looked to be a cupcake, not a muffin. The muffin was dark brown and black....it was burned and dry. I asked for another muffin that was not burned. The second muffin was the same way. I looked around at other tables and noticed all the people had toast, not the muffin.   The thin omelette arrived. It was burned and the bacon was small pieces of crumble which you could not taste. Sent it back to be made again. Received the same thing back, but it was not burned. The hash brown patty was like McDonalds but it was dense and not good. Not at all like McDonalds.  I gave this one star due to the manager coming over to our table to apologize and telling us she was taking care of the check.  p.s. The manager wanted us to try the Works potatoes.  They were small deep        fried potato pieces with Paprika dusted on them. They were served        cold and they tasted old, like they had been sitting around for a long time.",

    "text": "First time in here for breakfast and it was pretty good, I got the Chicken Fried Steak (they call it country fried) and it was perfectly cooked, crunchy and hot. The country gravy was the best I've had in a long time. The breakfast potatos were good, but a little plain and skimpy. Everything was seasoned so at least bland flavors were not in their repetoire. Very good service and prompt in everyway. A cup of coffee is $2.75 and they do leave a large decanter full so you never have to ask for refills, but it does kind of boost the check total up a bit. First timers like me may wonder where the menu is, but it is right there under the silverware, disquised as a thin newspaper. There is a wide variety on the menu including Hawaiian breakfast like loco moco and others. The breakfast burrito sounds good and I will have to try that next time. Location is a bit off since it is located way south on Eastern, so if you are coming off the 215 you will probably pass a dozen or more places for breakfast until you reach this location, but they do have a following on the other side of town so this is a welcome addition to the sea of restaurants located on Eastern Ave in Henderson.",

Him bein happy trust me is something i thought id never see. (why i had to take the time to write a review).  Price was right on with the food we recieved.   I wish it was more practical to make this a once a week ritual but we live on the wrong side of town but who knows I think Randi made such an impressoion it might just be.

PK asked him what his name was, told him about all the specials, asked him if there was anything else he could do, and even made him laugh. When we left, my nephew kept telling me how much he can't wait to go back because \"they know me over here\" because PK remembered his name.    THANK YOU PK! =)",

She had such a sweet attitude and was always smiling, even handled the situation of my daughter's French toast being slightly undercooked extremely well and with the friendliest care.

Banana muffin is really good especially if you pair it with coffee (i believe it contains walnut, just a heads up if you have a nut allergy). My son loves their spaghetti (kids meal comes with a drink). I usually get their country fried steak. But I've tried their country benny which is delicious! I've also tried the Sunrise mountain, which in my opinion, lacked flavor. Maybe because I ordered it with ham instead of bacon or sausage? Idk. But it was missing something, so I had to put a lot of Tabasco (I still liked it, but maybe will go for a diff. Meat next time). The staff are always nice and friendly!

    "text": "Cute restaurant for train lovers. My little boy loved the train that went all around the restaurant. The menu is large for those who love breakfast food. I opted for the hablo diablo burger. It was a large burger that came with excellent fries. The fries had a spicy seasoning on them that was used sparingly. The burger had a Cajun seasoning on it and a spicy chipotle sauce. I wish I would have asked for extra sauce on the side for my burger.  The service seemed to not have just one person waiting on your table but anyone who passed by helped. There was a yellow sign you put up when you needed something.",

I highly suggest the Greek scramble 2 eggs unless you want heavy eggs then go with 4  was absolutely delicious. The Pancakes were \"awesome\" and the California crepe was good, heavy on the cheese . Coffee was average. We will be bringing our puppy next time for that experience  For Those that may be following my reviews because of the Gluten Free either allergy. They do have a gluten free bread option but it goes through same toaster as the normal bread so not good for allergies. The potatoes may also be cross contaminated but they don't claim to be gluten free and really do try to be aware and go out of way to help and accommodate.",

Everyone I ordered it medium rare, it came out cooked perfectly with a red-to-pink center. The country style potatoes are always full of flavor - so get that as your side. Also, they cook the eggs right here! Over easy? No problem. Crack that yolk and watch it run all over your steak....heaven! You also get a choice of toast (sourdough or whole wheat), of the option of their famous and FRESH banana nut muffin!   If you check in on yelp you get an additional FREE banana nut muffin. These are so big you can share between two people. This isn't your normal muffin from grandma, the muffins here are way better, lol. They come out still warm from the oven (or warmer), cut down the middle of this piece of sweetness, spread a thin layer of butter and boom! Pretty tasty!   If you plan on visiting on a weekend, be prepared for a slight wait.",

I would of went with eggs Benedict, but was willing to try it!   General consensus from everyone in my party is that we would try again, since there are other options. Dishes we all ordered were just okay.   We went on a Sunday around 12, and the wait was about 30 minutes.   Banana nut muffin was great! Make sure you check in and get a free one :)",

My go-to dish is a Mushroom Cheese Omelette with Bacon, with the works potatoes. Extra tip ask for cheese on the potatoes, it truly is next level!   Can tend to be busy at regular breakfast hours with retirees, but its definitely worth the wait. They get you in and out without making you feel rushed. Or you can just wait until 1-2pm for a late lunch and walk-in and get seated REALLY quick!",

The food: Banana Nut Muffins -  must try!! Very moist and YUMMY!  Corned Beef Hash - better than expected. Wasn't as salty as other places! Carnitas Crepe -  Crepe was Meh,  but the carnitas were moist and full of flavor! The salsa verde it came with had great taste, with very little heat (not spicy for me at all)  Mashed Potato Omelette -  garlic mashed potatoes inside a omelette with chopped bacon makes unique combo. A lil too heavy,  but delicious nonetheless.   Country Fried Steak Skillet - the fried steak was cut up on a bed of their seasoned potatoes and smothered with gravy, topped with eggs (we asked for scrambled)  Bowl of Cincy Chili -  (had to try) an acquired taste. Not something we were used to. Couldn't help it. A sucker for chili, just had to give it a try.",

The service here is good and the  staff is always solid when we come in with our big parties. One server that always goes above and beyond is PK. Always friendly and attentive. My wife points out that we never have to ask PK to refill our drinks and that is big...happy wife happy life LOL. They have an egg sign on the table, one side is black and the other is yellow, if you need help you flip it to yellow. We've never used it with PK, which tells you guys- request for the guy. He won't disappoint.  We could come here for just coffee and those awesome banana muffins. The wife and kids love it. Its served warm, it's moist, and not too sweet. There are many occasions that we have ordered a bunch of these muffins just for our morning meetings.  The Loco Moco is another winner. We don't remember this being on the menu when we 1st ate at Egg Works, but we are glad its on the menu now. Loco Moco is from Hawaii- 1st layer is sticky rice, next a hamburger patty, eggs your way (i suggest over easy), and doused with delicious brown gravy. You could also sub out the meat if you want- you can substitute for spam or sausage. We've ordered the portuguese sausage (a little spicy, not too bad), eggs, & rice.... simple local breakfast. The parental units always get pancakes, eggs, & bacon. They give the thumbs up.  The weekends get pretty crowded, so make sure you go early. They have 1st come 1st serve seats at their bar style area where you can also watch news or sports. They have takeout, but breakfast is always better eaten while sitting down.  Stop reading and go eat breakfast already. Tick tock tick tock... hurry up",

I had an omelette doused in chili that was pretty much heaven in my mouth and the ladies had a variety of things. One had a skillet with all kinds of goodies that I will definitely be getting next time. The service was great and even though we stayed maybe an extra 15 minutes than we should have at breakfast time, I am so happy that I found a new breakfast place to add to the list.

Ordered the homemade  corned beef hash with eggs over medium...ill just say I'd rather eat the canned stuff.  The eggs were over cooked.  Our server disappeared after she took our order and we didn't get our order for over 30 mins AND they forgot the muffin. If this is being read by an Eggs Works manager...im sorry but the quality and service during my last FEW visits have been subpar compared to your completion..we have officially decided to never come back.",

    "text": "I don't get what all the hype is about this place. Service was fine, but food was not good, especially not for the price.   The weirdness started when we got seated. Our waiter introduced himself, took our drink orders, then left. A few minutes pass and another waiter comes up, introduces himself, and takes our drink orders. No mention is made as to why the first waiter left, etc. For any business to be successful, you have to communicate and manage expectations, and Egg Works failed in this one simple transition of wait staff.   It was our first time (and last), and neither of our two waiters explained the \"egg\" thing (where you have to flip it over to get service). (another failure of communication).   About our actual food, that was sub-par too. I ordered a waffle works with a waffle, sausage patty, and over easy eggs. My mom ordered a spinach benny. I could've made everything at home and it would've tasted better had I made it at home. Eggs had none of that cooked in buttery goodness that you expect at a restaurant, eggs were underdone even for an over easy because there was still that albumin in there. My waffle was the same kind of waffle you'd make at a continental breakfast at a motel (& dare I say it was worse than a motel waffle). And my sausage was not made on site, as they said it was. It tasted and looked like a jimmy dean frozen sausage microwaved for a minute before being put on my plate. My mothers potatoes were reheated out of a frozen bag. The Canadian ham that came with her eggs benedict had a bone in it!! Gross. Our hot sauce bottles were unopened, so I had to rip off the plastic wrapping (this shows that they don't think about the customer experience, just re-stocking the tables without concern as to how it would affect the customer).   Also, it was expensive! Our breakfast for two people was $27! There is absolutely no way I'm coming back.",

I compare them to how I was a server so maybe that is not fair.  She came right away and offered to bring drinks + then she took our order + then she brought the banana muffin + food came much later.  I requested tabasco and our party ate one third of their food before I got it.  I had the crepe carnitas and needed the hot sauce for the potatoes and carnitas.  It would have been nicer to have the food warmer.   She left the check when I still had food and my husband too.  She didn't offer to bring to go boxes I had to ask for them. There a saying to to tip the breakfast server more.  We usually do, in this case she didn't really deserve it.   The food was decent yummy but not more than that.   If there were other places that open early we would be there.",

My husband ordered the club sandwich, but said it was less than satisfactory. I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast, not sure about lunch since I just got breakfast myself.   Just a tip, read the instructions of the egg on the table before moving it. We didn't realize what the egg faces meant until we changed it and had a server come by our table asking if we were okay. :)",

Even though it had the normal business for a breakfast crowd, my server Joshua was attentive to my needs.  I ordered the Sundance special with seasoned chicken. It was very yummy. There was a nice amount of artichoke hearts which is usually a lacking ingredient at other places. The potatoes were nicely seasoned and the banana muffin was moist. All the food was brought out quickly and correctly. Joshua always came back to make sure that my table had everything that we needed. If only every waiter was like him!",

    "text": "I just ate at Egg Works for the first time and I can promise you, it will not be the last!! Although there were 5 other families before me, I didn't wait more than 10 min! They turn tables so quickly, there was never many people waiting. Not only is the food extremely flavorful with a great variety and some delicious alcoholic breakfast drinks, but I have NEVER experienced excellent service the way I have here EVER.  Heather was our server and she is a model employee. She was so upbeat and friendly despite how busy she was. She took time to chat with all her tables but still was attentive to all the others she had. I was astounded. I didn't have to ask for anything. I had refills before I even finished my drink! I asked to speak with her manager because as I said, I have never experienced such excellent service.  When I spoke with the general manager, Rochelle, she was thrilled to hear how pleased we were. I had to let her know that they were definitely doing something right here. Although, Heather herself was amazing, the ENTIRE staff never stopped moving! When one employee was at the POS putting orders in, others did not line up waiting to put their orders in. They would go find something else to do until the system was available. In just about every restaurant I have been in, fine and casual dining, employees always congregate and have personal side conversations. I did not see this happen once the entire time I was there. Maybe because Rochelle was constantly walking the floor and assisting in every way possible.  I am a huge fan of excellent service. The food is delicious, and delivered quickly, but the service I witnessed and received, was like no other! I have literally told just about every person I can about this place. It's too awesome to keep to myself!  Thank you Heather and Rochelle for a remarkable dining experience! I will easily become a regular so get used to seeing me!!",

    "text": "This is the same as the Egg & I. May even be same owners. Lists both on the menu for the LV locations. I have been to the Egg & I in Utah and it was very similar.  First the staff was great. Very attentive, friendly and quick. Never an empty glass and always brought things before I realized I needed it.  The location was great! Very clean lot and restaurant. In and out. No sloppily looking anything here!  We went on a Tuesday so there was no wait. I have seen a lengthy wait for this place though. Probably because it is so good.  Now the food. Everybody was very happy with the food. We had a party of four and most people left stuffed. The waffles were the perfect golden brown color and had soooo many berries on it. I wished I had ordered it.   The French toast was prepared with thicker than normal bread and had the scent of cinnamon lingering in my sinus long after we left. It looked like it was done to perfection. Just the right amount of crisp while still maintaining a nice \"softness\" to it. I wished I had ordered it.  The Bacon, eggs and has browns filled the entire plate. one just as equal as the other. The eggs cooked and the yokes not broken? My favorite!. The bacon was nice and crispy but not burnt. The potatoes had an awesome scent of rosemary wafting toward me. The cheese on top seemed to make the dish. The sourdough toast had me rethinking my choice. Yes, I wished I had ordered it!  The Fiesta Skillet was prepared to perfection! The melted cheese, the egg on top, the potatoes within all perfect. The skillet also had a great amount of green chilies in it. It was not too spicy. The flavors mixed together in a flavor explosion in my mouth. It also came with wheat toast and that was just as good and a tremendous help in getting all the incredible food out of the skillet. I wished I had ordered TWO!  Okay, Okay one was plenty. I actually ordered a half skillet which is not listed on the menu. Very filling and half the calories. I always seem to gain 6-8lbs when I go to Vegas and with the help of the half skillet I got away with 1lb after a 5 day trip. Booya!  I definitely recommend this location and establishment for all! They even have a bar type seating area with news shows and ESPN on so you can catch up on events while enjoying one of the best breakfasts in Vegas. I had five places I wanted to try for breakfast bookmarked but after eating at the first, it will be hard to not just go back here! The other 4 have a lot to live up to!!!  Most certainly will return here many times.",

Sounded amazing, but when I dove in, it wasn't all that to me. I'm not one to send things back, ever, but I couldn't even force myself to take it down.

She was the best!   She gave us the rundown of the extensive menu so we didn't get too overwhelmed.   She offered recommendations to help guide us through.  The meal starts out with a banana nut muffin which is so moist and delicious.   When the actual food comes, the portions are very large so make sure you come hungry!   We will definitely be back and hope to dine with Tina again!",

The corned beef hash is great, as is the Santa Cruz skillet, but my go-to is usually the Crazy Chicken Omelette.  Their seasoned potatoes are really good, and I'm not usually a fan of the cube-like potatos.  My hubby's fave is the 5-way Cincy Chili which (in case you don't know) is chili on spaghetti, then add cheese, onion, etc.  The chili is not normal Tex-Mex chili...it is a chili sauce and is a bit sweet, so I'm not a fan, but he LOVES it!  They also sell their own bloody mary mix, which I have got to buy and try one of these trips.",

I asked if they were harvest, the lady who brought them out said yes, so I started to eat... But then when the waitress came around, I asked her if she was sure because they sure tasted like regular ole pancakes and she said, \"Oh whoops, no those are regular. Should I have the cook whip you up harvest?\" At that point I was almost full, husband was almost done, so it didn't make sense to order again. I was kinda done after that. It was nothing special and the one thing I wanted to try, they didn't even bring out correctly. With the zillion other places on Eastern, why return? But we found ourselves nearby again today, and my husband decided he wanted to try it again. This time I got a Greek scramble and he got a child relleno omelet. He basically licked his plate clean and I barely touched mine. Had to ask for toast to help balance the severe feta flavor in my scramble. A little feta is wonderful, and too much ruins a dish. Unfortunately, that's what happened. Oh well, at least they keep pleasing the husband. Probably won't be back if I have anything to say about it. :/",

Looking around, I didn't see too many smiles on the staff's faces.  Yes, it was busy in there and it was loud but just didn't have a good feel about it, despite the cute decore.

Their was a little wait, but that must mean it is good, right? So, we sat and ordered our food. Mine and my kids food came out, but turns out the waitress messed up when inputting the orders and missed 2. The manager came over right away and apologized and assured the food was coming out and they would take care of it for us. The waitress came over and also apologized and let us know she was new and gave us a huge loaf of their amazing Banana nut bread. The manager then came back over and gave a coupon for our next visit. We were soo shocked as normally business dont seem to care that much! For example, we were at IHOP last weekend and there was a hair in my food. They didn't apologize or anything and had no shame yelling to the line we got a hair. It just goes to show that some businesses really do care.",

    "text": "This review is for the Egg Works (EW) restaurant that opened about a year ago at 10839 S. Eastern, Henderson, NV. Their hours are goofy but that is their shtick. They are conveniently located and usually not too crowded at the times I chose to dine there. My review is based on at least 6 visits over the past few months. Why so few visits? Read on...  The restaurant was converted from the old Bonefish Grill that opened and closed without much fanfare a few years ago. EW converted the interior to their open, bright and somewhat boring style that is reminiscent of a diner with green seats, small tables, painted murals and a motif that suggests the inside (or outside?) of a barn. That motif is apropos given the signature food served by this restaurant is the egg. The facility is generally clean though I have found crumbs on the chairs and benches as well as occasional sticky spots on the tables. The wait staff is friendly, professional and efficient.  My gripe is with food preparation. For the sake of this review, my order consisted of eggs, bacon, either a waffle or pancakes, and a drink. In six visits, the eggs have arrived correctly prepared from the kitchen only once; the bacon, three times; and the waffle or pancakes, twice. Believe it or not, I've had to request a new drink twice! For a restaurant that primarily serves breakfast, this is ... well ... amazingly disappointing. They usually delivered the eggs with runny whites (YUCK!) despite my request for \"over medium\" or \"over well\". The bacon was rarely cooked crisp. The flavorful waffles have been so crunchy as to be nearly burnt and the pancakes were so gummy as to be inedible (the fake maple syrup was only passable). The portion size, for the albeit pricey menu item, was average -- $12 for two eggs, three thin strips of bacon, 1 waffle (or 2 pancakes) and a drink. There was no garnish. Admittedly, other dishes have larger portion sizes along with somewhat higher prices. Other menu items offer breakfast potatoes (I avoid these because they are severely over-spiced) or a banana muffin (I think it is a little too sweet).  They do have one redeeming quality though: they stand behind their product. While I don't like to complain about the food I'm served -- and I rarely return anything -- if they notice I've left my meal over, they will offer to make a new one or adjust my check. Kudos to them for that but I really wish they would train their cooks to do a better job and have someone double check that the meal is prepared correctly before it leaves the kitchen (as the server isn't always the one who brings the food out).  I wish I could write that I liked EW more.  2 stars for the food plus 1 star for their pride.",

Food was good (although my pancakes were dry) and timely but the service style was not good! A jovial guy making lots of random comments to his tables, not fully understood, but the food was thrown at the table by backwaiters with zero interest for the table. No one checked back, no one brought butter or cream for coffee, etc. no one refilled my 2.25 iced coffee or other beverages. After our order was taken we never heard from the server again even tho he walked by our table countless times. No comments, no check on satisfaction! Too many great breakfast joints in town!",

Definitely felt like a homey kind of place. I ordered the eggs Benedict which I'm very picky. Are usually eat breakfast on the strip so I have a good idea but good hollandaise sauce should taste like. I wasn't disappointed. The only thing was that it was a little too saucy which made my English muffin a little soggy. Details are great and so was my pancakes. The only thing that they could've done differently was make sure that our waiter was it completely missing in action. I did have to wait for some coffee refills for a while and I ran out of water a lot. Other than that i would definitely go back..",

Shortly after , we were seated and greeted by our waitress named Chantel . She was very knowledgeable of their large menu . She even recommended some combinations that were not on the menu . I decided to try one of her suggestions and it was to die for . I'm usually reluctant to order other than the same thing so this was a big deal for me to change my usual order of bacon and eggs . Thank you Chantel for opening my taste buds to a whole new world .",

One ordered a \"wrap\" and asked for it on a corn tortilla rather than flour. The waiter said, \"Really?\" And made a strange face. It was uncomfortable and embarrassing for the poor child who has a food intolerance. The other gluten free person ordered a Works Tostada. Tostadas are served on corn tortillas but this came out in a flour tortilla bowl - which is not what the menu said.  But that wasn't before a Breakfast Tostada was served instead.  The waiter said he wasn't even aware of the Works Tostada on the menu and admitted he entered the order wrong.  Needless to say none of us will be returning. Very disappointing and unsure where the great reputation comes from. All food was mediocre at best, and service was clearly below average!",

Added bonus is that they have a great patio with umbrellas that is pet friendly, so you can bring your pooch on a nice day!",

I ordered the country fried steak skillet, and it was absolutely delicious. The plates are on the larger side, so come hungry. Egg Works started our morning off positively! All workers were awesome, especially PK! Probably one of the best servers I've ever had :) I would definitely recommend this restaurant for breakfast and lunch!",

Though, the little waiting space inside can become a serious traffic jam.  The service is friendly and attentive. You'll have a main server, but if you flip your tableside egg to yellow (how you let your server know you need attention), anyone at all will come over and get you what you need.  The menu is plentiful. Lots of delicious sounding items. And it's not just all eggs and breakfast. They have pancakes, lots of sandwiches, etc.  Besides juice an soda, they do offer a couple of cocktails (bloody mary, mimosa, red bull and vodka, and michelada). But the cost doesn't really justify what you get. I'm still not sure there was any vodka in my bloody mary.  If they ask if you want toast or a banana nut muffin, take the muffin! It doesn't look like much (this is not a place concerned with presentation or pretty plating), but it is positively delicious. The portions are huge, so come hungry or don't be afraid to share. It was so hard to choose what I wanted, but I finally decided to go with the chili omelette. So yum! The cincy chili here is quite fabulous and tasty. And the breakfast potatoes that most items come with are outstanding. Seasoned so well you don't dare want hot sauce or ketchup.  All in all, a good, cheap, hearty breakfast was had. We'll for sure be back.",

The patio here is pet friendly which you don't find often in Henderson.   My husband was craving biscuits and gravy and a bloody mary and he was satisfied that Egg Works had both. I on the other hand was craving a few things on their menu so I opt'd to order a few side dishes; cincinnati chili cup, turkey sausage, and a side of eggs ( 'not really a breakfast but it was all delicious) . They have their own hot sauce here a green and red that you can buy at the front which I was a huge fan of.",

When I am it comes time for breakfast, you will k now that the egg comes first and Egg Works is like the best place for breakfast in Henderson!  Here is the dealio....  a.  Location - Sunridge Heights and Eastern on the West side of Eastern.  Easy to get to and plenty of parking!  b.  The wait - This is the key to any breakfast restaurant and the wait here is quite satisfactory.  I have come here from 7:00 am to 8:30 am and even lunch and the wait on a Sunday or on a popular holiday Sunday is never more than 15 minutes.   c.  The wait control - As much as the wait, with  your anxiety at a higher level, the control by management of the list is also proactive and top notch!  d.  The menu -= Yeah baby...  Whatever you want, whatever your \"diet\" ,  whatever you are feeling, they have it.  A list of key menu items are:  - Egg Substitute - Hash Brown Substitute - Cottage Cheese and Fruit for sure. - Hawaiian breakfast - Cincinnati chili - Thin chili sauce over spaghetti!!! - Pancakes - Omelettes - Traditional eggs - Biscuits and Gravy - Hamburgers - It goes on and on......  e.  I love the menu because there are times when I want an omelette and when I want something decadent like a hamburger or biscuits and gravy and they have it all.   f.  Pickiness - If you have picky kids, or family members, here are there are so many choices that are scrumptious and fun that you cannot go wrong here!  The right wait, the right food,  great service, what more can you ask for?  GK says....check it out.",

I ordered the veggie benny and... WOW! The hollandaise sauce was delicious the egg was perfectly cooked the whole thing was just absolutely phenomenal. The portion size was huge! The potatoes are absolutely delicious as well. I like the metal card things that they have that can be flipped over if you require service. We didn't need to use them since our server was attentive. The kid had the stuffed french toast an d though it was \"so good\".  The one downfall,  I never really care for the whole line up at the end of your meal to pay. Especially in a place like this that has a lot of people, because you end up waiting in line for a while just to pay your tab.   As I said, next time I visit Vegas, I'm taking the 20 minute trip just to eat breakfast here.",

While I absolutely Love the coffee being right on the table for refills, it's a moot point if the carafes are filthy. Coffee slowly became grosser and grosser each time we went. Then we realized it was the carafes getting dirtier and dirtier - never got better, only worse and we've moved on...  Still has 2 stars because the food remained consistently mediocre the entire time, so if you don't drink coffee this place is still ok to eat at.",

    "text": "Just got back from breakfast and I have to say, you could do better than eating here.  The place is busy, so I may be in the minority on giving this a less than stellar review, but there are some important things to point out:  The Good:  - Friendly and attentive service - Food was hot when served.  The not so good:  - I had an omelet - the Western.  Maybe just a personal preference, but the cheese should be IN the omelet, not on it.  When you melt the cheese on top, it overcooks the eggs.  - Omelet eggs are tough, like they are mixed in large batches and watered down.  The egg was very pale and tasteless.  You could see the color difference between these and the scrambled eggs.  - Fillings, onion, pepper, mushrooms and ham, were not flavorful and over cooked.  Also chopped very small.   - POTATOES - They have some type of house seasoning that they put on the potatoes.  Fine.  However, there was so much of this salty seasoning on them that they were inedible.  This was True for all three plates delivered to the table.  Way too salty.  - Toast was cold and soggy.  Finally, a smaller issue but one that always gets me, the check was delivered with our entrees.  This always makes me feel like we are getting rushed to turn the table over.  Not cool.  One other item:  Not once or twice, but four times I heard them apologizing to customers for ill-prepared food or other issues, including us being seated at a table that was not cleaned yet.  It was $44 for three of us to eat with no additional sides, which puts this on the higher end of breakfast in Vegas.  You could get the same quality food from a casino at half the price easily.",

I ordered scrambled eggs with pepper jack cheese, ham steak and their famous banana muffin. This meal was right around $10.  The food didn't take too long to come out. The muffin came put first. It was good, but would have been better if it was served warmed with butter. That would have kicked it up several notches..  My dish came out nice and hot. My eggs were so fluffy. Very memorable. Probably the best scrambled eggs that I've ever had. The cheese was perfectly melted on top. I was very happy about this because nothing pisses me off more than getting eggs with unmelted cheese on top..ugh... The ham was delicious. Grilled to perfection. Not too salty either which is the case with a lot of ham steaks that I've been served.  Egg Works was a hit with me. I look forward to dining there again.  Ps: I have public restroom phobia..but I appreciated the fact that their restroom was spotless during rush hour with only a few stalls available. I was relieved.",

I had the veggie skillet with their famous banana muffin and my server Ethan was kind enough to tell me there was a smaller size available. I was in shock how big the small size was. I always have to add something to my food to suit my taste. Not here though both were deliciously perfect. I asked who the chef was today, since that usually makes all the difference. It was the assistant manager Aaron or Eric. I'll be calling ahead to see when he is working. The atmosphere was pleasant with a unique theme. The coffee was delicious. Because  I rarely find black coffee the way I like it, I stopped ordering out. Today I took a chance and ordered a cup. Great veggie skillet eggs, yummy banana muffin, coffee, atmosphere and service! I would not have changed a thing. Perfect!",

    "text": "This egg works for me!  Came here on a whim when a bad case of the \"brunchies\" hit my GF and I. This place was packed! I mean, it was Saturday at around 12:30pm, but OMGEEE! Thankfully we weren't a family of seven and were promptly seated.   Egg works has this weird system in place to make sure you're always getting fed or refilled. You do get an official server for your table, but there's also these yellow and black eggs placed on stands on each table. When you need something, you flip the egg over and show the yellow egg with a sad face, this tells other servers, \"help, I need more coffee!\". The black egg face indicates that everything is egg-xactly fine. I tried this and yes it works, like a moth to a flame.  Like I said earlier, this is a family place and there were kids everywhere. Normally that's my cue to eat somewhere else, but I decided to deal with it via a bloody mary. I wasn't expecting much of a bloody mary from a place called \"Egg Works\", but this tasted like pure tomato juice. Not sure if there was any vodka even in it. Definitely pass on this if you find your hungover self here, but whateves, I'm here for the eggs.   I started my meal with a banana nut muffin that my GF and I shared. This was very good, super moist, soft, and just the right amount of sweet. I could have easily eaten another one, but I wanted to save room for B-Fast burrito coming my way. I got the Santa Cruz burrito. This isn't on their website menu, but it's pretty much the Cabo Burrito except with chicken added. This was very hearty and tasty; the tortilla was soft and warm, the chicken/egg combo was very cohesive, and the sauce they drench on top was full of flavor. This burrito did lack some spice, but I was able to remedy that with the tableside hot sauces they provide, which I found out they make in house. This was plenty of food for one person and a great way to ensure that a mid-afternoon nap would be in my future.   Egg Works wasn't my favorite place and honestly I don't see myself coming back here soon, but it did do the trick for that case of the \"brucnhies\". Eat on my friends.",

Our Chili Relleno and Bacon Avocado omelettes were  delicious. Too much for us but what a wonderful breakfast.

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.  Egg Works is another good option for a reliable breakfast in Las Vegas.  They have 4-5 locations around the area and is a sister restaurant to Egg & I.  We came at about noon on a Sunday and had a surprisingly short wait of only 10 minutes which is very atypical for the \"Egg\" restaurants which are usually pretty busy and a normal 20-30 minute wait.    The best parts that I enjoyed were the omelette's size (4 eggs) and the banana nut muffin.  Truly one of the better muffins you can get for breakfast at any restaurant.  It's not crispy on the top, which I usually enjoy for the crunch, but still tasted awesome.  The omelette was a little too cheesy but overall tasty and big.  As far as service, the waitress was very welcoming (if not too welcoming, asking about refills and such literally every five minutes) but the food took very long to get served.  Usually \"Egg\" restaurants have very quick turnover and cook fast, but it took nearly 35 minutes for a crepe and an omelette.  The muffin came out first so there was some type of an appetizer, but the food itself was remarkably tardy.    The price was around $25 for two full meals which is typical of most breakfast joints in Las Vegas.  I had a tasty meal and I still recommend Egg Works, but expect to wait to get seated and I guess at this location to be served as well.",

We asked for 2 coffee's and placed our order.  After about 15 minutes of sitting there our waiter walked by and we asked for our coffee a second time.  His reply \"I am moving as fast as I can\"  !!!  And that is all he said as he walked away.  What kind of response is this?   You would think an egg/breakfast restaurant would be prompt on coffee service.  We promptly got up and left.  We left not because of the wait, but because of the terrible response.  No \"I'm sorry\", no \"I'll get it right away\"  instead all he said was  \"I am moving as fast as I can\" !!!   If one of my employees said that to a customer I would fire them on the spot. This waiter is in the wrong line of work.  We proceeded to the Cracked Egg on Green Valley Blvd.   We had coffee brought to us within 2 minutes of sitting down and our meal within 10 minutes.  The Cracked Egg was a very pleasant experience compared to having to put up with the Egg Works employees' poor attitude.    All three of us agreed, we will never go back to the Egg Works.",

But checkout sucks. You can't pay from the table. You pay as you are exiting. They don't have it where you can enter your own pin so you must show ID unless you're paying with cash. Then you are asked by the cashier if you would like to tip. I find this rude. You can request to have your receipt printed and you can write it down. Cashier wasn't the friendliest either. Don't plan on returning.",

But she handled this so smoothly and with such great service! I have been in the service industry for 10+ years and she was very impressive with her skills.   I had the veggie Benny! Oh good lord! Amazing hollandaise sauce. Veggies were fresh and fruit as a side dish was on point.  My bf had an omelet with veggies which was awesome as well.    We def will be coming back here!

The people at Egg Works get the idea of turning tables. On Sundays, the house is always full and the wait times are 5 minutes or less. That's a great job of getting them in and out when you operate a breakfast restaurant.       Real eggs are used for all their menu items and are fried up in a 6 inch pan, not on the grill like some greasy spoons. Eggs over light, over medium , over well, poached, scrambled or basted are available. Expect the egg whites to be cooked through for a perfect taste.       A fast and friendly staff awaits you at Egg Works. It's our number one choice for family breakfast.",

The first day, we ordered the steak skillet (special of the day), the chicken and spinach skillet, and the mouse pancake for our little one. The food was excellent, and came out very quickly. Nicole let us take our time as we looked over the huge menu, and even let our baby keep taking straws from her apron pocket. She also explained about their homemade salsas, homemade muffins, and told us where to find coupons to dine there again!   The second day, we came back and were again seated in Nicole's section. She remembered us from the day before. She again gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and decide, and gave the baby straws again. She loves them! This time we ordered biscuits and gravy, and the veggie works benny. Yum! Also, since we just moved back, Nicole asked if we knew about some local changes since we left, such a new grocery stores.   We went to pay, and discovered they offer a 30% military discount!  Score!!!  We will definately be back (maybe tomorrow?) And will request Nicole's section!",

I changed the waffle meal to pancakes, yummy!!    2 pancakes are huge and shareable.   Ask for 1/2 portion if you don't have a large appetite, it doesn't cut the cost in half, but I am not wasting food then.    And they have 1/2 and 1/2 available for coffee if you don't like those little creamers.  Also tried a skillet, was really great mix of flavors.  Love the potatoes.   Our first waitress was a little rude, but have had 2 great ones this week alone, so maybe she was having a bad day.   Great about cleaning off your table if you are done, which I find many restaurants don't do any more.   They serve Coca Cola products.",

Food came quick. Sucks that the meals don't include bacon, so it cost almost $4 for 3 strips...boo!  So, didn't have bacon with breakfast.  I had the Island Favorite w/ Portuguese sausage (simple breakfast w/ rice and 2 over-easy eggs) and hubby had the Denver omelet (he said bell pepper pieces were cut way too big, not diced like he's used to); we ordered a short stack to share (ok, but much better at the cafe).  The food was fine, but not any more special than what we can get at the buffet or even at the cafes and the price is way more expensive here.  Felt ripped off, I guess I'm just used to either getting late night/early morning cafe deals or paying breakfast buffet prices and getting more for my money that way. I'd rate the food quantity and price at a 2, and the food quality at a 3. This should be a 2.5 star review, but upped it to 3 stars since our server actually did a great job...i think his name was Ethan, or something that started with an E...nice Hawaiian guy, may have been a manager. Glad I tried this place out, now I can cross them off my list - too bad they didn't make my repeat list though - we won't be back.",

I got the banana pancakes, not realizing they just had bananas on top. Kinda funny. Service there is good but seems a lot of work for something not as good as I'd hope. The atmosphere is nice which is a plus! Not too bad but not my favorite either.",

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend frequently go to Egg Works for breakfast. The food is great and the portions are big. I usually order one of their many omelette choices and they know how to make them just right so they're fluffy and not too dry. I also like that you can order half size omelettes if you're not too hungry. The potatoes are yummy too and I like that they're not over seasoned. Another thing that's been great about Egg Works is the service. This past Sunday our server was PK, and he was really friendly and attentive. Egg Works is always busy, but I liked that PK was there when we needed him. He was really awesome and made me and my boyfriend laugh. Thank you Egg Works for being a great breakfast place!",
