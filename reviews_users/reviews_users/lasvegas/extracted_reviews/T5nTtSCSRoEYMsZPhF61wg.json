I have my sights set on the fruit waffles with ice cream next.

I love their waffles they are so unique I would describe the taste as sort of like a sweet croissant like taste, and a light  fluffy and crisp texture, not heavy like your traditional waffle.Also the milkshakes are my sons Fav!!!

Every bit a 'locals only' sort of spot, hidden in a small strip-mall on the East side of North Durango, it was just after 7:30am that I entered the brightly lit space and finding myself to be the restaurant's only patron until a family of four arrived at eight o'clock both order and service were expedited, the mother and sons team chatting amongst themselves in the kitchen while I watched Obama address the Iraq situation via wall-mounted LCD in back.  Obviously content in sticking to the waffle-centric theme with a menu entailing options either sandwiched or standard it was only after substantial debate that I eventually settled on two of the items listed under \"Specials\" and declining further customization beyond making my Banana Split base chocolate I'm happy to say both piping hot options proved divine, the mountainous split's base harkening the flavor of hot cocoa beneath ripe bananas while the Sweet P's supple crumb was soaked through with cinnamon spiced apples and a liberal ladle of caramel for a decidedly sweet experience just barely reined in by the slowly melting ice cream.",

The waffles here are crisp on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. Just the way of waffle is supposed to be.   The staff is always extremely friendly. There are times when they get busy that it's a little slower than others but overall not bad. The bacon is great. The waffle sandwiches are good and even their waffle pizzas are good. My daughters love their chocolate smoothies. This is a fun place to go and take the kids. They can order a waffle with ice cream and whip cream and chocolate syrup and fun stuff like that.  The next time you think of going over to cracked egg or IHOP and waiting for an hour to be seated head over to waffles cafe instead. You will be pleasantly surprised.",

I just waited for everyone to finish, annoyed, wanting to get out of here.   if I wanted a Costco meal I'd go get samples for free.   poor presentation, poor quality food, one star is what they get. will not be coming back.  another suggestion is don't skimp and penny pinch on quality to serve value. we would have been better off going to McDonald's to get the breakfast plate, 3 of them.",

I asked for no whipped cream but still got it on the sandwich when it was brought to me but it was easy to scrape off.  Not sure what the punch cards at the front are for since we weren't offered or given one. Maybe it's for the beverages.   I love my fruit sandwich and would be happy to come again.",

The place was surprisingly quiet, although there were a few different groups of people inside.   Shakes: Good and simple. I was more impressed with the fact that it came with a jumbo straw rather than those other skimpy ones.   Overall a must try if you haven't stopped by.",

Decor: Upon walking in to the restaurant, you'll find tables and chairs that remind you of a courthouse diner. They're pretty basic but get the job done. This place isn't fancy, so just throw on a hoodie and head over.  Food: The waffles are probably the only food item on the menu that is made from scratch. I have had the breakfast special several times now, and I'm positive the turkey sausage is the frozen/microwave kind, while the eggs are powdered or liquid. The food is pretty average, and I would only suggest coming here if you don't feel like driving the extra 2 blocks to Denny's.   Takeout: When ordering takeout, be sure to check your bag for all of the necessary condiments. Last time I ordered a waffle to go, I was not provided with syrup.",

The waffle is excellent, the eggs done perfectly, my bacon was crispy as I like it, not crazy about the coffee, but that's just me.  Super friendly people, and I watched as the young man left his cash register to hold open the door for a disabled man,.....now that's CUSTOMER SERVICE....over the top, above and beyond.  Will definitely return as the food is quite good, the price is good and the customer service is excellent.  Will also tell everyone at church about this place if they don't already know about it!",

They serve up buttery waffle-icous meals: Waffle Pizzas (saaaay whaaat?!), Waffle Sandwiches, Waffle Sundaes and Classic Waffles w/ endless toppings(see photos for menu/prices). There are lots of add on options so you can create the waffle of your dreams. All the ingredients are top quality, and you can taste it.    What we ordered:  My fiance ordered the classic waffle sandwich. The waffle was warm and fluffy on the inside and had a nice crisp crunch on the outside. The waffle was stuffed with  layers of crispy bacon, scrambled eggs and ooey-gooey melted cheese: Perfection!   I ordered the organic flax waffle with sliced bananas, diced strawberries, and chunks of mango with powdered sugar. They didn't skimp on my fresh fruit toppings. Instead,  they loaded that sucker up (just the way I like it). Again, my waffle was warm and fluffy on the inside and had a nice crisp crunch.  Every bite was like a piece of heaven!    If you're looking to be WOWed by ambience, keep calm and carry on.  If you're looking for a casual and unique spot to grab breakfast/dessert/lunch, Waffles Cafe is your place. We loved our breakfast and will be returning sooner than later.   Bonus: They're located in the growing NW/Centennial area!",

They have a good variety of interesting waffles for breakfast, lunch, and dessert.  They use fresh ingredients (avacado on your waffle, anyone?) They have fantastic drinks and smoothies and the atmosphere has a quaint, fun, local feeling to it.  I thoroughly enjoy the Waffle Cafe and return often.  Con's:  The paper plates and plasticware leave something to be desired.  And although the prices aren't bad, one does pay a tad more for something you'd otherwise have to make at home.  Depending on the time of day, you might have to wait 10-15 minutes for your food, other times it's to you in 5.",

    "text": "I went here with my daughter and she got a pumpkin pancake.  I ordered the breakfast special.  I was fasting for a glucose test, and chose to break it here, and preggo so very very hungry.  Staff was friendly, coffee was mediocre, my waffle was inedible.  I'm not sure what happened, but it tasted like a lot of baking soda.  There was no substance to it either. Kinda like the turkey on Chevy Chase Christmas vacation.  If you haven't seen that movie, you are missing out...  The pumpkin waffle was pretty good, nothing outstanding.  The fruit was really fresh.  It was a bit run down inside, there was a fan going in the front middle of the floor.  The mismatched paper plates gave it a cheap feel, which was not cool or trendy in any way.  I was disappointed overall.  Based on other reviews I'm guessing my bad waffle was a fluke (benefit of the doubt).   What would bring me back... 1.fresh roasted coffee (buy the beans from a local roaster or something and charge a bit more)  2. fresh half and half (mini moos are just gross, everyone knows that stuff is full of chemicals, allowing it stability at room temp for eons,) 3.real plates, or at least presentation that shows you care about presentation, show some pride in your waffles!  Not mine, the ones you usually serve, I think... 4. a little spruce up inside (time to redecorate!) Again show some pride.  Those toy/candy machines have to go, and fix your AC! 5. And obviously, a waffle that's better than what I failed to eat.  Thankful the bacon and eggs were OK... What I liked- 1. Friendly staff 2. Concept of a menu based on a waffle, including pizza, sandwiches, sundaes, and hard to find seasonal flavors...punky punkin! 3. Its fast.  You could capitalize on this with cool to go packaging.  Possibly a drive thru, and great coffee.",

The \"restaurant\" is actually more of a fast food establishment where you order at the front and then they give you your food.

A+ for the actual waffle sandwich itself though.",

    "text": "So glad we finally made it to Waffles Cafe. I love waffles for breakfast, but was looking forward to trying the dessert waffles that I seen pictured on Yelp. I had the Banana split waffle on a chocolate waffle (delicious). My Dad who doesn't even like waffles had the Pumpkin Waffle with apples and vanilla ice cream. He ate the whole thing and said it was great!! He didn't save me a bite. My waffle was slightly crisp on the outside-light and fluffy on the inside and the warm waffle melted the ice cream perfectly. The bananas were fresh and plentiful. The waffles are bigger that I thought, but we had no problem finishing them off. Service was great and friendly. Looking forward to my next visit.",

But we have been here twice now, and both times I left feeling disappointed.  The service has been slow both times, and the food... although unique... is just not that great.    Honestly, I feel like I'd be better off buying a waffle-maker and making this stuff on my own at home.   I would save money, get better service AND I wouldn't have to try to eat a thick waffle with a plastic fork and knife!",

We wouldn't drive back up there, but if we were in the neighborhood we would eat there again",

I decided to give Waffles Cafe a try since I haven't had a decent waffle in a long time. I was greeted by the cashier who was very friendly and helpful. As I looked at the menu, I asked him about the pizza waffles and waffle sandwiches. I thought it seemed kind of odd but he suggested that they were really good. They had a variety of different waffles to choose from, I didn't know if I should be bold and just go for the pizza waffle or play it safe and get a regular waffle with any fruit topping I wanted. Decisions, decisions, decisions...I ended up getting a chocolate waffle with bananas, strawberries, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. I was not disappointed!  I also ordered a iced Chai Tea, which was okay.   Not only do they serve waffles but they also have Boba, what a way to finish up your meal!",

I had the breakfast special with 1 waffle, scrambled eggs, sausage, and coffee.  I upgraded to a chai latte for a fee.  I think it was around $8 total.    Delicious!  The waffles are almost inexplicable.  They are ultra crispy on the outside, super light, and moist and fluffy on the inside.  Eggs were cooked nicely.    Service was very nice and atmosphere was fine.  I would surely return soon....if I'm in the centennial neighborhood.",

The owners are super cool, the food is awesome, and they play great music.  If it's not too busy, sometimes one of the servers busts out his guitar!  Recommendations:  1) Breakfast waffle sandwich- ham, scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese and the house sauce all nestled in one delicious, homemade waffle.  It comes with chips as well!  2) Breakfast special- if you are in the mood for a more traditional breakfast, you can pretty much get everything separated.  Two eggs however you like them, bacon or sausage, and a drink.  3) Create your own- your choice of plain, chocolate or pumpkin waffle then whatever toppings you want!  Chocolate waffle with strawberries and bananas is quite good.  4) Miscellaneous- they have regular turkey or ham waffle sandwiches and waffle pizza for the more adventurous!",

The shopping center is questionable. There are only 3 restaurants occupying the property, yet every window has signs of new-coming restaurants moving in. I think there was 8 other restaurant signs and all under construction. So random b/c my bf's lived there for 1.5 yrs and its been an empty plaza.   Tried the waffle sandwich w/ bacon, ham, cheese, and advocado. It was really good! There was a slight sweetness in the waffles(?) which made the sandwich sweet and salty. Bf ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, it was good but mine was so much better. I really want to try their sweet waffles but we were hungry for lunch not dessert.. that just means must return soon!!   The restaurant was open and big. The guy who greeted and took our order was really pleasant. Gave me free coffee! The menu was small and simple easy to order. I love finding mom and pops neighborhood restaurants!!!! Overall good experience would def. come back time and time again (:",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure this concept came from the, \"high-dea\" jar. I mean savory waffle sandwiches? Excuse me Cheech, your order is ready.   The decor in here definitely needs updating and some style, it sort of feels like you're eating in the teacher's lounge of an elementary school. Nothing here really makes you want to stay and hang out, just finish your meal and bounce. Good thing decor doesn't diminish my appetite or I would be about 30lbs lighter, seriously Vegas you need a major overhaul when it comes to restaurant style and atmosphere.   The waffles here are good, lightly sweetened which went well with the salty breakfast options. I ordered the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich; sausage, ham, eggs and cheese. This was definitely a meal, the portion was huge and filling, but doesn't leave you wanting more. It's like watching an \"OK\" movie; you've already forgotten the main character's name ten minutes after it's over. One more thing about this meal, it's served with a side of Ruffles potato chips, huh? How about side of syrup or a sweet jam for dipping?   The service is very good and fast, but I'm assuming that's because they cooked my meal with a microwave. I mean when you can hear the beeps and clicks of the radiation machine in back and your food comes out piping hot within five minutes of it being ordered... ugh.  The food was good, the service was good, and nothing was remotely close to great. I feel like there's a real lack effort with Waffles Cafe, they're doing the bare minimum and giving the bare minimum. A new coat of paint, waffles made to order and maybe a few special touches to the menu and this place could easily have a higher rating and possibly become more of a hangout spot.   Waffles Cafe you're so close.",

And after noticing my baby doesn't like waffles, asked for a hash brown. Over all I have no issues after dining here. But, the high chair wasn't cleaned. And the place was empty when I arrived. So I'm not sure if they just recovered from breakfast? I would go back if I make it to centennial again.",

I went the safe route this go around and ordered a breakfast special that included eggs, 2 sausage links, one huge waffle, and an endless cup of coffee.  The coffee, eggs, and links were good; the waffle was GREAT!  So light and airy.  It was quite possibly the best i've tasted.  Not some flour laden waffle shaped biscuit whose weight rivals the plate its on.   If you check out their website you can see all the yummy toppings they offer on their waffles.  If you can dream it up, im sure they have it!  As if that weren't enough, they also offer an array of Boba Teas and Smoothies!

Arriving there it looked really empty which SCARED me, but I thought it maybe was because it was 10:00am on a Monday?? The people there were so nice and explained their \"$5.99 Breakfast Special\" which consists of  eggs bacon or sausage and a waffle.Due to me trying to eat better he suggested the \"organic flax seed waffle\" with strawberries. My bf had the waffle with mango and pineapple. We also tried the Boba Thai Tea. Everything was delicious. EVERYTHING. My flax seed waffle had a funnel cake- ish texture almost.It was still light  and soooo good.It was topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream (which he went light on)I also topped it with a little of their strawberry syrup, Divine! The egg whites were awesome, they seemed very fresh. The bacon was ok, nothing special. Even though my bf's waffle was gone in a blink of an eye I did manage to taste some and his regular waffle with the  kiwi and pineapple topping.His fruit topping too were fresh and sweet. Neither one of us have ever had a Boba Tea so this was our first time. Needless to say I'm hooked. It was sweet and creamy. Very good. I like this place because when we left, I didnt feel \"bloated\" or super full as I do with other pancake houses! I also loved that we were in and out of this place in 25 minutes!If you like waffles I suggest you give them a try!",

LOOKED flat and unimpressive, but it, too, was delicious. Coffee came with our meals and was excellent. As we ate, the wall-mounted menu taunted me with a picture of a luscious-looking waffle pizza. Waffle pizza? Yup. Sounds strange, but looked mouth-watering. I hope to give it a try before we leave. If I do, I'll give you an update. The people were real sweeties, too.",

The place had a \"local\" moms/pops feel to it which was nice.  The breakfast waffle came with eggs and choice of meat...and unlimited coffee.  My daughter ordered the Yooni special which was so yummy- strawberries, bananas topped with chocolate sauce and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream, almost too pretty to eat!  My son devoured a plain waffle topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream (we added bananas for a small add'l charge).    Pros:  Variety, taste, fresh fruit, price and friendliness of staff.  Cons:  Waffles were kind of cold, no refills on soda (cans)  Overall, it was a good experience.",

It was a Wednesday morning so no one was in there but me, and I had the coffee all to myself, woot woot! They even have my favorite creamers there, vanilla and hazlenut. YUUUUSSS!  Price range is neat, $6 for a big ass waffle, eggs and bacon. The waffle was amazing in my book, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Eggs. They were eggs. Bacon kinda looked dry and stale to me, which disappointed me at first, but I guess it had a jerky texture to it, so in the end it wasn't that bad at all.  I like how everything is served on disposable utensils. From the paper plates to the plastic forks. I'm an odd germy-phobe, so to not have to worry about whether the dishes were washed properly definitely lifted my spirits.  I saw they had some sort of waffle pizza on the menu, which I really want to come back a try.",

Mine was very brown and crisp. Not only that, but the wait time was too long. We waited a good 15+ minutes before the food was served. When it came out, it was served on paper plates. The bacon and eggs could have been made better at home. When paying for food you expect the presentation to be better than what you would do at home. For the price paid, it was not worth it. It was my first time trying it and I won't be going back.",

I also think now that they are doing combos, makes it for a fast, tasty and cheap meal option of a waffle breakfast, sandwich (with chips), waffle pizza,  etc. with a drink for under $7.   My favorite thing to get is breakfast waffle sandwiches (egg, cheese, ham, bacon) which makes for a good bit of savory and sweet. I pour some syrup in mine. The crinkle cut kettle chips are possibly homemade? These are plain, but good. They let me do ice tea as my beverage which is fresh brewed. They also added a water dispenser which is welcoming since I like to drink a lot while eating. My one negative thing is I liked their chicken sandwiches before, except now it seems they use ready made grilled strips. *womp, womp*   Still, I do like their fluffy style waffles here. It's different from what is usual, but it's a good kind of different. Definitely a plus I can come here in the afternoon and can order breakfast. I love not waking up early just to grab breakfast/brunch and deal with crowds on top of that.",

I was excited to see that they also have boba teas and smoothies on their menu. That will be on my list to try on my next visit, along with a breakfast sandwich. My family doesn't go out for breakfast often, but I can see us returning here soon. This is the type of place that I could see us becoming regulars at.

Nothing special, in fact, I could have had fast food and not paid as much.  I suppose if you were to go there for your overly indulgent sweet tooth then it will hit the spot.   As for me, I will not be a return customer.   I would have rather waited in line at Babystacks.",

Light crunch on the outside and fluffy inside.  I also enjoyed the original waffle with whipped cream, powdered sugar, and topped with caramel sauce.   My waffle was part of a breakfast special which came with eggs, bacon, and unlimited coffee....Perfect way to start the day!    It felt a little stuffy in this small cafe, but I got used to it.  Staff was very polite and helpful, especially with the free wi-fi.   I've got my eye on the waffle sandwiches or the waffle pizza for my next visit.",

You order at the counter but go wait at the table for your food to be delivered. They serve it on paper plates with plastic utensils. If the waffles are crispy, this is tough to use with ease. The waffles were ok with plenty of options for toppings. They also serve boba drinks which is a huge plus in this part of town. They are on the right track, but for the price point, it needs to step up the presentation a bit.",

You get something like a George Foreman grilled chicken breast if you want the chicken with your waffles, which is what I had. So pretty much, its everything you can make at home.

The menu was on the wall, then ordered at the counter, got my self serve coffee, and the food was brought out like 5 mins later. For 6.50 tax included, I got the breakfast special-a waffle, 2 strips of crispy bacon, 2 eggs and coffee. The bacon and eggs were gravy, the star was the waffle-more crispy with the inside softness more so towards the middle/center of the waffle. Everything tasted fresh and not processed. The waffle was so good that I ordered a second. I left an hour later relaxed, full and completely satisfied.  I was a bit weary to eat off paper plates and plastic utensils (as I had read this in other reviews and as a rule do not like to) but, the experience was so good that it didn't bother me at all, almost didn't notice it.",

I think my only criticism is them serving it on paper plates and the ambience of the place could really use some improvement. I don't remember having music at all.

Drinks 7/10 Standard soft drinks, breakfast combo comes with unlimited coffee, Thai Tea had too much thai tea and not enough condensed milk (aka way too orange)  Environment 8/10 Good breakfast sunshine from the windows in the morning, and nice and cool during the hot summer days. Not a fan of Styrofoam plates and cups when eating in, but its understandable.   Enjoyment 9/10 I have gone to this place at least two dozen times. Great food, great family, and very accommodating if anything went wrong.   Overall 33/40 = 82.5% = 4 stars.   I grew up in the east coast, DC area to be exact. When most people think of a Waffle house, one can't help but think of Fried Chicken and Belgian waffles and a slightly dirty Denny's style diner. Sadly that's what I thought of when I first approached \"WaffleS\". This was not the case  First impression is its super clean environment and bright lights. It's definitely not an ethnic style waffle house. This is done asian style, hence the 'Cafe in WaffleS Cafe. And I can tell you I'm definitely a fan of this place. The first time going there you'll get a small culture shock as all your stereotypes get blown out of the water, THEN you'll get a little shock at the different varieties and styles of waffles you can choose from, literally a plethora of combinations.   When you decide from choosing between a standard, pizza, or sandwich waffle, you have 5 types of batter. From there, there's a a few dozen toppings from anchovies to strawberries, lets not forget all the syrups and such.   If you want a waffle your way you will get it your way. My personal favorite is the standard flaxseed waffle with maple syrup. But if i feel a little indulgent, you can't help but try Yooni's Favorite: Plain Waffle, with bananas, strawberries, whipped cream, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with chocolate syrup.",

The waffle itself is crunchy in initial texture yielding to the soft and sweet breading inside. It's not fancy or expensive and I've never had a bad experience earing here.

My turkey sandwich was delicious, it was so big I honestly didn't think I'd finish it but the waffle just melted with every bite.

Since they've moved, I've only gone to this location 2 times. While the food is still great, it feels so depressing inside knowing how quiet and dead it is in this location.

The ice cream on top would have been amazing alone, but the warm buttery waffle underneath it only made it better. The whipped cream and chocolate sauce certainly didn't hurt either.  Their menu is pretty impressive, considering they only do waffles. This is a place that is good for breakfast (obviously), lunch, and dinner. The toppings and possibilities here are endless, and making a choice was quite the task.   If I do ever end up returning, I am incredibly interested in trying one of their waffle sandwiches. That is if I can resist the banana split waffle again.",

My step-sister and I each ordered a breakfast sandwich and a smoothie, and we ended up paying $25. A little more than I was planning on spending, but the sandwiches were REALLY good. I wasn't even that hungry until I took a bite, but oh man that sandwich was gone fast.   The smoothies were interesting, I'm not really sure if they were made out of real fruit. They could have been a little fruit and a lot of ice cream, but something about them was just kind of weird and artificial. Not an ideal description of a smoothie.  I think that if the restaurant had real smoothies, dishes, and utensils, and if they brightened up the decor, I would feel like the $25 I spent was worth it. As it was I felt a little gypped- but they still get three stars because I'm getting hungry just thinking about that waffle sandwich, haha :)",

Overall the whole experience was ok. I was greeted as I entered by the young man behind the counter and he asked if I been in before. When I stated I had not he explained the menu, made suggestions, and answered my questions.   I ended up ordering the breakfast special but sub'd the eggs for another piece of bacon because I don't eat eggs. The meal as stated on the menu comes with a waffle, eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage, and a coffee for $7. I felt the pricing most of the menu items was reasonable but I did not like that all topping were at an additional charge. Most place at least give u one topping free and charge for all others.   My food was prepared within a very reasonable amount of time but the following things were off-putting to me: 1. Food was served on paper plates (mind you... This was not a take out meal), and 2. The waffle was extremely light for a Belgian waffle. It was crisp which I didn't  mind except it was so light. Usually Belgian waffles are full and filling this was not the case with this waffle.   Overall, the people here were really nice but it really is not my idea of a great breakfast joint. I really wanted to love it too because they were so sweet and the other reviews were so good but just doesn't float my boat. On to the next I guess....",

The eggs were fine and the bacon was cheap... the waffles weren't bad but it was hard to enjoy with the strong smell of grease floating through the air. The worst part is they used paper plates and plastic forks and cups. I spent $34 to be served off plastic... and what about the environment??? They're obviously not recycling because you can't recycle anything that's soiled. The amount of money they probably spend on plastic-wear they could probably invest in some actual dishes and glass-wear. The coffee was the best part and they were very nice but I won't support a business that doesn't consider the environment.",

When we walked in, I thought that we were surely in for a bad experience. I looked around and saw paper plates on tables as well as plastic forks and knives. I also saw some interesting looking waffles with a lot of \"stuff\" on them. I'm just a regular waffle kind of guy with just butter and little syrup. My initial thought was that they have all of the \"stuff\" on them to hide a bad waffle.   I looked at the prices and they were amazingly inexpensive. That was a good start. They had bottomless coffee that tasted really good. I ordered their waffle special which was a waffle, an egg, and bacon or sausage as well as the coffee. It didn't take them long to bring the food. I thought the short wait was reasonable. The bacon and eggs were not anything special. How can you mess that up and yet, how can you make that scrumptious? The waffle? PERFECT! I had just been looking up a recipe for a perfect waffle. That would be: one that taste delicious, kinda sweet, crispy on the outside, yet creamy on the inside. Yum!",

I hate to give this review because the people were so nice but I feel like I waited 40 minutes (yes, 40 min) on a not so crowded Saturday morning for nothing. Did I mention that it took 10 of those minutes to get my orange juice that they must have went to florida to squeeze.   As for my food, my fruit topped oat waffle was a bit on the crisp side.  I had to add some syrup to soften it up.  Not to mention it was hella small.  And my son was not happy with his pepperoni pizza waffle either. I tried a piece and the marinara sauce tasted like a canned spaghetti sauce.   This place has a lot of potential but it would probably take a Groupon or something for me to give it another shot.  Once again, I apologize for my review but my son and I are still hungry and are probably about to spend 17.00 elsewhere.",

And not bad with chocolate milk as well for reasonable under $24. Staff seems a family own place and peaceful over here by the dealerships. Cook is a sweet lady and super quick. Food taste great and service is what you get in decent manner. Spacious and opens at 7AM? Why not Haha although I wish my son would eat more right about now!  Over all it's a great place for this time of the hour. Coffee is self service and water. Walk in take a shot visually at the menu and order when your ready and find a seat!",

My boyfriend and I wanted to do a brunch Saturday morning. I had mentioned to him that I've always wanted to try out Waffles Cafe!  Its really easy to get to, directly off of the 95/Durango and a few blocks west. It's located next to the 7-eleven, blinders burgers, North End Pizza, and a local butcher shop.  As soon as you walk into the Waffles Cafe, the smell just takes your breath away! It smelled so good inside! The Menu had all sorts of waffle creations! The tables were clean inside, and the back kitchen looked well-kept.  My boyfriend and I decided to try the following  Pumpkin Waffle with apple pie filling, Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, and Cinnmon Waffle Pizza (SUPREME) Waffle Breakfast Sandwich (Egg/Ham/Syrup)  It was soo delicious. My boyfriend ate the waffle pizza and we both ate half of the waffle breakfast sandwich. The Pumpkin Waffle with Apple filling was so delicious. The apples were baked perfect and the vanilla ice cream was a good touch on the waffle. I would order it again, however, there are so many other great selections on their Menu that I want to try out!!   If you're located in the NW of Las Vegas, you need to try Waffles Cafe out!!",

The food is great as well as the tea and smoothies! The ham sandwich on the gluten free waffle and Thai tea are a must for me.  Very affordable and accommodating.  Cheers Waffles Cafe!",

    "text": "My cousin brought me here for the first time and I see why she is so devoted to this beautiful place. The people that work in there and run it to begin with are phenomenal!!! Add that on top of having a deliciously tasting assortment of waffles makes my taste buds and heart go crazy! I am a waffle fanatic by the way so a place like this is a slice of heaven.   I was very basic and ordered the classic breakfast (waffle, bacon/sausage, eggs). The waffle was good, don't get me wrong omg I've NEVER been served beautiful and hot eggs!!! I can't even keep my eggs that hot when I cook them myself... I'm hating lol. I also ordered a pineapple and peach smoothie (yasssss). I ordered a raspberry white chocolate waffle to go.   A thoughtful gesture, they waited on cooking my waffle order to go. It was brought out when it looked like we were getting ready to leave. Being the conversationalist that I am, we didn't leave right away which was totally fine. When we did decide to get up and leave, one of the employees says that she'll make me a fresh order. I'm like nooooo that's ok, this will be fine. She continued and then the guy explained how they wanted me to have a more fresh order. My heart filled with even more joy. That was going well above and beyond the expectations of customer service.  Granted I still had about two more stops before I got home, however these waffles were both perfectly fine despite my rough handling of my bags. This place will continue to receive my business and I hope wherever reads this will go and support this particular location of Waffles Cafe as well. There's more that I can add onto this review as of why I  it so much but I'm getting ready to dig into one of my waffles .",

My order arrived at the table and might I say my Waffle couldn't of smell better. After taking my first bite  I was hooked. My Waffle taste so lite not heavy like the others,the butter was melted evenly on my Waffle and they have so many options of syrup to choose from its unreal. The scrambled Eggs were perfect not hard and the Sausage link, well it was a sausage link, but good. I will definitely go back for more you can bet on that.

It awkwardly quiet, maybe they should have music playing in the background. My turkey sandwich was great, TWO thumbs up and I love the potato chips that came with my special... However, my boyfriend's ordered the breakfast special and the waffles left something to be desired. The bacon was great though. I was debating on the three or four rating, but I went with 4 because if I had just order the sandwich I would have been very happy with my choice:)",

I always get the Jeff's favorite which is a pumpkin waffle with apple pie filling, vanilla ice cream, caramel and whipped cream which is awesome. I love the waffles here and the service is excellent. My boyfriend and I actually walked in 10 minutes after closing and normally you would get turned away at any other place but not here and the gentleman at the register greeted us with such kindness and didn't rush us at all. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves waffles but the one thing that I love the most about this place is you can tell that the people who run the place really appreciate their customers.",

A place that serves food smells bad? We ordered. The kids said the food was ok. I didn't like the waffle at all. It tasted yeasty or something. I can't even describe it but it wasn't good. I also ordered a pineapple smoothie and it was flavorless. To make matters worse, the trash cans were overflowing to the point that you really couldn't add to it. The bathroom was super dirty too.   The service was great. Everyone was super friendly.  But the fact that the food wasn't good at all and the place was dirty, means we won't be going back.",

    "text": "Went here with family recently for breakfast based on good reviews.  It is a very simple place, with several tables and a counter where you order.  Basically you look at the big waffle based menu on the wall and seat yourself and wait for your order.  There is a good selection of waffle types, such as chocolate, pumpkin, flax, and regular, and a wide variety of toppings you can pay to add.  There are also waffle pizzas and waffle sandwiches, so make no mistake, waffles are the focus here.   Our experience was not exactly stellar.  We were 4, and ordered and sat down.  The silverware is plastic silverware and paper plates, which is not exactly the most convenient way to eat a meal, if one has ever gone picnicking.  We ordered 3 waffles, and a side of eggs and a sausage.  It took 57 minutes to receive.  FIFTY SEVEN minutes.  The place was moderately full, but not a single person came in after us.  The food itself was not bad, but it was not sensational either.  It was basic waffles that one could make at home, with some scarce toppings put on top ($.50 for a dollop of whipped cream and another $.50 for 3 strawberries sliced up).  The eggs were just simple scrambled eggs.  Now, while the food did not turn me off, it did nothing to instill me with a burning desire to return, and after a near HOUR long wait for what should have taken 10 minutes tops, I will not be back.  The guy at the counter tossed us a couple of $5 coupons, but it came when they brought us the food, and there was nothing said in the intervening hour.  No \"hey sorry it is taking an eternity...this is why...\" or anything of the sort.  Overall, I give it 2 stars since the food itself was acceptable, and I like to reserve 1 stars for places that are utterly disgusting.",

I thought I would be having some magically delicious waffle... I did not find it to be magical at all. The waffles are big and somewhat tasty. I think it's the butter, not the syrup, that makes it good. The supreme pizza waffle was a bore... I didn't bother to finish it. I was happy to find that they had boba drinks (odd for a waffle place, right?), but noticed they were pricier than my favorite standalone boba location. It was $4.50 for a large Thai tea w/ boba. Again, it only tasted okay. (I would gladly pay $5 for super tasty boba.) Even though I received a stamp card, I won't be coming back here.",

The pumpkin batter was absolutely delicious and the fruit were so fresh!  Definitely not the soggy, miserable little fruit IHOP puts on their fruity-tooty pancakes.  I proceeded to have a conversation with the guy at the register, turns out he's one of the co-owners.  He was a great guy.  He explained to me that they used to have high school kids work there but then they started reading bad reviews on them mentioning customer service so now he works there all the time.  I love that!  He cares about what us customers have to say.  So heads up to anyone that might've had a bad customer service situation with them in the past.  I went on a weekday morning and there was only one group of people in there before me.  The lady of that group put 2 dollars in the tip jar and thanked the co-owner specifically for the customer service and said she loved her food.  It's not often you find a breakfast place that isn't a typical waiter restaurant-style.. so this is a great alternative if you don't have the time for all that.",

We all literally had the same thing: waffle, over medium eggs, bacon. And everything was consistently cooked perfectly to order. The waffles came with a great amount of butter snack dab on the middle. They were crispy and soft in certain areas with a naturally light sweet flavor on their own. The syrup comes room temperature and they also offer strawberry and boysenberry syrup on the counter. The bacon strips were thinner, FYI for those who like thicker cuts. BUT they were crispy and a good meat to fat ratio. No issues with the eggs, at all. This was a second visit here and from what I can remember from before... it was just as yummy! The breakfast also came with unlimited coffee. I love that there's a punch card here, as well! I've filled up my card on this visit and am up for $5 off for the next visit. Deff comin back!",

It might be time for them to do a little touch up painting in the dining room too.  Don't expect much other than some decent and inexpensive food. I do need to comment that the waffles were REALLY good, despite the spartan layout. Another plus is they offer a 10% military discount.   The young men working there were pleasant and helpful in aiding us in a menu selection.  You go direct to the counter and order and they bring the food to you at your selected table.   The tables we sat at had both been cleared, but not wiped down, which is probably not a good idea considering that waffle syrup is a staple condiment. Breakfast included unlimited coffee refills, but you need to go get it yourself.   FYI, they do not have a soft drink dispenser, so if you order a Coke, they will bring a can and a cup of ice...kinda like they do in Europe.   All in all, not an unpleasant exoerience, but we'll keep searching for a North Las Vegas breakfast favorite. Can't for the life of me figure out how anyone could rate this a 5 star...NEVER.",

The waffles are seriously the best. Golden brown and crispy on the outside and fluffy and air filled on the inside. The breakfast sandwiches are HUGE and tasty! The classic breakfast special is amazing. This place is so simple it's crazy! Definitely hits home. I'll be back *drops imaginary mic",

    "text": "I liked the waffle, it was crispy and light and  creamy (not raw...think of a cruller donut) inside.  This was my first time here so I wanted the purest version and got it plain. There are other toppings but you have to pay for them.  So it can get pricey.  I got the breakfast special which included eggs and bacon. The eggs were a little runny but I ordered the bacon crunchy and it was PERFECT.  You order the food at the counter and it is served on paper plates.  Dixie paper plates. I get that they want to keep food costs down but to me that is unacceptable and plastic utensils? Not a very environmentally friendly place at all.   You don't get a server no one asks if everything is okay, it's all self serve and you pay for your food first and if course there is a place to leave a tip. Which I overtipped...  Inside the place is UGLY. It's not inviting at all.  I am not looking for a luxuriously tufted pillow to set my delicate butt on or anything but something in there, ANYTHING could match something else.   It's not a place I'd go back to.",

The tables, floors, and walls could have used a really heavy duty scrubbing. This place is another example of Americans being offered very unhealthy foods. These type of dishes with high calories and little nutrition should be saved for a day at the county fair.  I ordered one pumpkin waffle with apple toppings. I passed on the ice cream and whipped cream, but I still could only down half of the waffle and I felt very heavy afterwards. The order took about 10 minutes to make it to the table. The bf said he saw an employee scoop ice out of the machine with his bare hand... Not my idea of sanitary-- The other employees were wearing gloves while making the meals. The employees seemed hard working and pleasant. I was really bummed to see all the disposable silverware, cups, and plates.  The menu didn't offer enough light or healthy options and the dining area was a bit to cramped and uninviting to entice me to return.",

I remember someone telling me that it was \"ok\" and it's \"just waffles\".   No sir, this is not just waffles. These are delightful, crispy, amazing waffles. I love them so much, so so so much.   I got the organic waffle with - Strawberries Peanut Butter Chocolate Chips Bananas Almonds   - I used the sugar free syrup, and to my surprise, it was amazing. They do have real maple syrup if you're looking for a sugar high.   I really could not get over how good these were. Probably because I'm on pretty strict clean diet and I don't have too many amazing cheat meals like this. But good god...It was worth it.   The service was awesome - the only thing is they forgot my kiwi's...but I don't even care. I really don't.   If you drive by this place and you're wondering if you should try it out, yes. You should.

Waffles cafe has smoothies, boba tea, hot tea, waffle sandwich, waffle pizza and the good ol' waffles.  They have specials:  Breakfast for $5.99: waffle + egg+ bacon OR sausage + unlimited coffee OR add $1 for other drinks.  Lunch for $6.49: waffle sandwich + chips + soda OR waffle pizza + soda  The Sweet P for $6.95: pumpkin waffle with apple pie filling + vanilla ice cream + caramel + cinnamon  Short Cake Split for $7.45: original waffle + strawberry + banana + vanilla ice cream + chocolate sauce  Banana Split for $6.69: banana + ice cream + chocolate sauce + almond + sprinkles + whipped cream  You can also create your own waffle from $3.95-8.95 (choose from original, oat, flax, chocolate, pumpkin) and add toppings from 75 cents-$1 (walnut, pecan, strawberry, sprinkles, peanut butter, Nutella, chocolate chips, marshmallows, Reese's chips, chocolate sauce, M&M's, caramel sauce, coconut, banana, kiwi, mango, peach, blueberry, raspberry, apple pie filling, cherry pie filling) or maybe get a side of bacon, sausage, egg or wheat toast for $1.50.  I built my own waffle. I had the original with Nutella + strawberries + mangoes. They added powdered sugar and whipped cream on top.  Since I already have Nutella, I didn't put any syrup on my waffle.  The syrups they have include maple, sugar, boysenberry, etc.  Food is served on a paper plate and they'll give you a plastic fork and knife. The downside to that is it's not too appealing but I guess the good thing about that is if you want to take your food to-go, you can just put foil on top and voila!",

I would like to make an attempt to describe the the waffle. It was very light and had a crunchy crust exterior. It tasted sweet and fluffy, like a fried Cotton candy, but not as sweet. I love lathering syrup on my waffles but I didn't need to this time.   The eggs were scrambled and layered thoroughly in the sandwich. I love eggs so it was perfect.   Got Meat!There were generous slices of ham and bacon in the sandwich. The ham was not greasy or salty. Bacon was cooked well and crunchy. It was a nice combination to the ham.   Say Cheese. The cheese was melted on the eggs and dripped over the ham and bacon. I am not sure if it was American cheese or cheddar, but my mouth liked it.   So if you are ever in the Vegas area and you're looking for an inexpensive, delicious breakfast place. Go to Waffle cafe!   Thanks for reading my review.",

We had the littles with us so we ordered a double order of the original waffles with whipped cream and strawberries, a chocolate chip waffle, and a ham and bacon waffle sandwich. It's a seat yourself joint, so we picked a table and grabbed some booster seats. Hubby grabbed his coffee at the self serve coffee bar and I grabbed my water. About 10 minutes after placing our order we got our food. They forgot our Littles chocolate milk and it took a second to get them. The food was hot the waffles crisp and fluffy on the inside. But it wasn't mind blowing. They forgot no tomatoes on the sandwich and it was just very underwhelming for the price. I think this place is best for dessert waffles.",

They had some house sauce on it that was sweet but interestingly nice.  And we also got their choclate strawberry waffle thing. Can't go wrong with this combination. Yum.  There are so many choices of waffles and some pretty interesting ones. Did I mention I love waffles? I need to try all the varieties, but only had room for 2 different waffles to share with the bf.  When we went here for a late breakfast, it was pretty quiet. Only 2 other people inside from what I remember. But as we sat waiting for our food and eating it, there was decent traffic of people ordering waffles to go. It is nice that they have different flavored batters for their waffles.  Must say, the idea of this place is great. Almost a dream come True. And though the waffles were yummy, they were not superb. It did have a different flavor from the traditional waffle and healthier? And a nice place to just sit and chat...It is a place I would return with my waffle cravings. Since it is pretty close to my house.",

I ordered the Yooni's favorite, topped with strawberry and banana slices, whipped cream, ice cream and chocolate syrup.  My fiancee being the avid banana freak she is, ordered the Banana Split waffle which was equally delicious.    As far as the service is concerned, I guess maybe that's contingent upon how many people are in the establishment at any given moment.  I didn't personally experience anything strange or feel disrespected enough for me to waver my opinion.  In fact, I thought the service was stellar, albeit a bit slow.    I will definitely be back if I need a quick breakfast waffle pick me up.  This WaffleS location also serves Boba Tea and the French Vanilla one was one of the better ones I remember having.  This Boba Tea is also very dense, when the server handed it over, I thought I was going to break my wrist.  Ok..I'm being a bit facetious, but the Boba Tea was particularly heavy.",

I just asked them what the most popular was, the recommended the breakfast sandwich, and i can see why.  I was unusual to have a breakfast sandwich with waffles as the bread, but it was awesome.  Only problem was the side.. plain potato chips, weird..  I could have ate two of them b/c i as pretty hungry.    I am going to frequent based on price!  Open from 0600-5pm",
