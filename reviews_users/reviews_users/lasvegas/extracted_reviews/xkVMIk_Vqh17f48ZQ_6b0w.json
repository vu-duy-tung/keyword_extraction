    "text": "A major disappointment.  It was pretty good... but I was expecting greatness.    FOOD: The food was disappointing.  The tarragon completely overpowered the lobster bisque.  I ordered a Ribeye, which was flawlessly cooked (medium rare), but somehow, had no taste.  I don't understand this (and I'm not someone who wants my steak slathered in nonsense sauces or spices), but everyone else at the table was underwhelmed by their main dishes as well.  The sides (a mushroom dish, corn) were fine, but nothing special.  SERVICE: The service was excellent.  Knowledgeable, friendly, attentive without being intrusive.    PRICE: This is a high end restaurant, so you're paying top-dollar.  ATMOSPHERE: If I had to design a steak house, this is exactly how it would feel-- a bit dark, everything felt heavy-- just a perfect place to have a steak and some wine.    IN SUM: I loved everything, except the food.",

We once again ordered the prix fixe menu with wine pairing and once again we were blown away at how good each item tasted.  I even ordered an Assam tea to start the meal and thought it was the best tea I've ever tasted. I've been to tea gardens in Victoria, Canada and tea houses in China and Taiwan and somehow, this was the best tea of my life.  I will continue to be skeptical on my next visit but I certainly hope that the best meal of my life will remain here for a long time to come.",

My parents had a recent milestone anniversary so we bought them dinner here last month and they're in complete agreement. Both parties did the Chef's Beef Selection with the angus beef and were not disappointed. We went for my birthday and to celebrate quite a few milestones we had made in the last year. Our dinner included:  Apps: Salted Rolls, Shrimp Cocktail, Lobster Bisque, Caesar Salad, Arugula Salad Main: Ribeye and Strip Sides: Potato Puree, Assorted Mushrooms, Risotto Dessert: Monkey Bread, Lemon Meyer and Orange Basil and Raspberry Sorbets, Farmers Fruit, and Chocolate Souffle with Happy Birthday written on it. The service was incredible - the team aspect works like a charm. We loved every part of our meal from our greeting at the front, throughout service, until we rolled out of there stuffed.

    "text": "My dining companions arrived at 520.  Ten minutes prior to service starting.  We were escorted to the bar while the wait staff was finishing up their pre dinner preparations.  After ordering a round of cocktails and sipping those for a few minutes were introduced to our table.    Hello nice table, How are you?   I'm great, please enjoy sitting in my extremely comfortable chairs and enjoy the atmosphere.  These chairs were amazing.  The leather was so soft.  After discussing a basic meal strategy, we agreed upon, a salad to start, followed by our entrees with a few sides to share.    For my salad, I ordered the frisee, warm egg and bacon salad.  OMG OMG OMG....  When I cut into that egg and all the yolk ran out onto the frisee, the blue cheese, and the bacon and I tasted it, I knew we were in for a real treat.  The bacon chunks were cooked perfectly.  All the right flavors came to the party.  Salty was there, he brought his friend Savory, and he brought his cousin Tangy.  And let me tell you, these flavors knew how to party.  The salad was big.  I tried to eat as much as I could but there was.... Well let's just say I wasn't going to be the guy who couldn't finish his steak because he went big on the salad, ok?  After my two dining companions helped me polish off the remainder of the salad we started to dip into that bottle of 2006 Honig Cabernet.  This wine tasted great on its own, I couldn't wait to pair it with the Steak.  Queue the steak.  Drum roll please.......  Ah yes, my I present you with la surf and turf.  A 6oz Fillet cooked to medium rare accompanied by his old friend half a Maine lobster.  It was clear that after tasting this dry aged beef and all of the amazing flavor that comes with the aging process that these folks cook with a lot of butter.  Hey, you only live once, right?  Seriously though, the steak and lobster were both cooked perfectly and I couldn't have asked for anything more.    My friends got the strip steak and the skirt steak, both of which I sampled and I'm happy to report that both tasted amazing.  The three of us split the potatoes au gratin and some maple carrots.  Each of the sides was great.    As we worked to polish off the bottle of wine, and reflected on the past weekend, I was a little sad that I was going to be leaving.  But what an amazing way to cap off a Las Vegas weekend than a wonderful dinner with great friends.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided last minute to go to Vegas on leap day in 2008 to get married.  On the drive to Vegas I booked a room at the MGM.  We arrived at the hotel in the early afternoon and then headed out to get a marriage license and get married.  When we returned to the hotel we were starving and not sure where to eat we decided on Craftsteak.  We put in a reservation and were reminded of a dress code for men.  It wasn't an issue because we were already dressed nicely, afterall we had just gotten married.  Anyway, we arrived on time and were quickly seated.  To our surprise, however, there was a man in the booth next to ours wearing shorts and a football jersey!  I think someone forgot to remind him of the dresscode.  The place was very dim, almost to the point where you couldn't see what was in front of you.  But we were in a great mood and didn't really think much about it until much later (months later in fact).  We ordered the 32oz porterhouse for 2, fingerling potatoes, bernaise sauce, and the warm frisee salad, which I don't think is on their menu anymore.  We also got a few drinks.  The porterhouse was brought to us already sliced into bite size cubes and then pieced back together again, which was nice.  It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The potatoes were delicous as well as the bernaise, which by the way I have yet to find a bernaise sauce that tasted as good at theirs.  Also very good was the warm frisee salad which had some thick pieces of bacon in there.  I checked out their current menu and unfortunately I don't see it there so that sucks.  My husband and I have been to a number of other steakhouses hoping to find a place that tops this but have yet to find one.  The food here was very good, but the price was up there.  It was about $250 for the 2 of us!  I can't recall if that included the tip or not, but I have a feeling it didn't because we both had a couple drinks each.  We'll definitely be coming back here again.  In the meantime we'll continue to look for a steakhouse in L.A. that compares.",

The only thing she wanted to do was eat at this restaurant. We tried to make a reservation, but it was almost impossible to do. One of my girls had to sign two, not one, contracts to get a reservation. In addition, they weren't very specific about the details until the last moment. While that was annoying and very upsetting (hence the lost star), the food was incredible! OMG. I ate so much that I had to roll back to my hotel. The short ribs were so juicy and tender that I didn't even need a knife to cut them. The vanilla cheesecake is a must. The drinks were just awesome. A great selection of wine. When I go back to Vegas, I'll be back to eat at this place.",

After watching him critique up-and-coming chefs for years I wanted to see if he had the goods.   Craftsteak did not disappoint.  I am no expert in fine dining, but I really enjoyed the experience.  Beautiful dining room, perfectly lit, energetic crowd buzz but at a reasonable volume.  The service was awesome and the food was better than I expected.   We went with the domestic wagyu beef tasting menu which was spot on.  Just sat back with our drinks and let the servers deliver amazing dish after dish to our table.  FYI, Wagyu really does taste better than regular prime cuts.  And the portions were no joke.  After delicious lobster soup, three appetizers, a full ribeye and a full filet mignon, and three amazing side dishes, they brought out four desserts and I almost exploded from being so full.  I picture tasting menu's as wimpy portions but this was the total opposite.  I don't think a party of 4 could have finished all the food we were served.    Bill was around $450 including tip for party of 2, but I felt like I got my money's worth.  A 100% worthwhile experience if you have the coin.",

    "text": "So very, very good. The steaks are excellent, and the Grade 7 Wagyu beef ribeye was worth the $105 pricetag if you truly love meat the way that I do. The sides are also fabulous - butternut squash, kale with pine nuts and white beans, french fries and chanterelle mushrooms were all yum yum yum. Somehow, I took down my 14-ounce steak and all of these sides without a problem, even after enjoying three of the deliciously buttery, salty dinner rolls. The key, I have decided is not to waste your time on starters or dessert. My table skipped the former, but we got suckered into dessert (mostly because we really wanted it)...and that was a bit of a disappointment. The Chocolate Ganache was too bittersweet (even if that is your preference, as it is mine) and dry, and the Cinnamon Monkey Bread was good, but not enough to stand on its own.  Service was well-guided, though they have a tendency to want to clear the plates before you're done - annoying. And one server in particular didn't listen all that well...you know when you can just tell somebody is rushing to finish your sentence or answer the question you haven't yet finished asking?   But all in all, a very good dining experience. Note: I would be pissed if I was not seated in the actual restaurant (which is huge), but rather, the bar area or outside in the mall. Hopefully, they reserve these less desirable seats for those who have not made reservations?",

    "text": "I had stayed the weekend in Vegas to participate in the Rock n' Roll Marathon and 1/2 and my plan was to go to Craftsteak and enjoy a great meal after completing the half marathon.  I was very much looking forward to this meal as I have been a fan of the show Top Chef and was interested in trying Chef Colicchio's restaurant.    My cousin and I went over there and asked for a table for 2, and the hostess said it would take 45 minutes.  I actually wouldn't have minded, but I knew my cousin was hungry, so we were considering going elsewhere.  While we were still standing in front of the hostess, a gentleman had asked what the wait time was for 2 immediately after the hostess had already told us it would be 45 minutes.  The gentleman was given a 25 minute wait time!  I was somewhat shocked, but I decided to brush it off and we went to Shibuya, which was located next to Craftsteak.  And there, at Shibuya (which is a very good restaurant in itself), is where I fully realized the extent of the situation that had come about.  I was astounded and upset and very disappointed to be brushed off in such a way.  It was not as if either myself or my cousin were dressed inappropriately, and now my fear is that either we were racially profiled or that our size was a bother to them.  Either way, it still upsets me that a restaurant would treat us in such a way.    I'm not sure I would ever eat there now, and I've had no reservations of telling my friends and family of what took place.",

Food: first: the rolls here come to you in a cast iron little bake pan and are hot and buttery good.  Drinks: 2 of the best 2 drinks I have ever had! Dark and Stormy: that was perfectly made and best dark and stormy ever Billionaire Cocktail: I forgets whats in it but extremely good. I need to Google its contents.   Brussel Sprouts with Bacon: wow so good and packed with rich flavor.   Potato Puree: If I need to have a side dish for my death row meal this will be on the menu. I have not had the Joel Robuchon potato puree but if it is any better than this I will probably make love to it at the table. Just a perfect buttery potato bliss  Kobe Wagyu beef skirt steak: super tender with all its fatty goodness but, I enjoyed my 2 side dishes more.

(We each also had steak) and we had food to take home. They also give you unlimited rolls with butter. These rolls are literally life changing. So tasty! Do yourself a favor and try it at least once!",

From the moment you walk in, the place is very attractive & buzzing - lots of activity going on.   Spectacular service awaits you here - we were a table of 8 & constantly had 3 people helping us. True professionalism that is missing in many restaurants.  We did the chef's tasting so the chef chose the apps & desserts & we got several kinds of steak & lobster to eat as our main.    The apps were shrimp cocktail, salads, prosciutto, & other things that I forgot but everything was fabulous.  SO HARD to not pig out during there apps!  For entree's we got 5 different kinds of steaks - all cut for us & every one of them were mouthwateringly delicious!  We also got lobster - lots of it.  We also got lots of sides - I ignored them - too much other good stuff to fill up on!  The desserts were all yummy as well!   The wine prices were also reasonable & not outrageous like the place next door.  Truly a spectacular experience & one I will never forget!!!!",

    "text": "12.28.14  Now that I'm older and have no desire or energy to go clubbing when I'm in Vegas, I've found another way to blow my hard-earned cash.  $$$$ restaurants definitely fit the mold. Unfortunately, Robuchon was booked up through the week, so plan B it was. OpenTable reservations were plentiful for Craftsteak, so this was nice and easy.  We waited a bit to be seated. We waited a bit longer to get our drink orders in (highland fling for him, malbec for me). And even longer between courses. Service was spotty, to say the least.  Portions, however, were generous. I'm glad we settled on sharing one appetizer (the lobster bisque), one protein each (short ribs for me, kobe skirt steak for him), and a side (shishito peppers).  Lowlight: the lobster bisque was way over-seasoned, and didn't really signal a great start to the meal.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tom-colicchios-craftsteak-las-vegas-2?select=g3iit_zkN6Fw0eDJhvqzDg#g3iit_zkN6Fw0eDJhvqzDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tom-...</a>  Saving grace: both the short ribs and the skirt steak were cooked perfectly. The ribs came out steaming hot while the skirt steak was a tad cooler - perhaps was waiting for the other dish to be finished before being brought out all together.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tom-colicchios-craftsteak-las-vegas-2?select=g3iit_zkN6Fw0eDJhvqzDg#03DW_mPIiZEWZA0mEoTb6w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tom-...</a>  The shishito peppers were a good balance, but we could only finish half the plate given how large the meat dishes were.  Overall: glad I checked this off my list, but no desire to return anytime soon.  Total damage for two: $229",

    "text": "Pack Your Knives & Go!   I used to be a huge fan of Tom Colicchio & Top Chef back in its hay day, and I'm always a lil leary about celeb chefs who open up shop but given his snarky, critical ways on Top Chef I had higher hopes for his restaurant but my great expectations are rarely realized... The reviews I read prior to coming to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak located in the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV are all over the charts. Read on for a fair, balanced & uncensored review...  The menu at Craftsteak is extensive, a la carte & expensive. There are a plethora of starters, sides, starches, veggies, varying types of steaks including both Domestic & A5 Japanese Wagyu, seafood & other meat options to choose if beef isn't your baby. There is also a vast offering of wine, liquor, fine bourbon & whiskey selection at Craftsteak.  First off, the complimentary bread at Craftsteak is called \"Parker House Rolls,\" and they are these soft, traditional-style dinner rolls that are served in a cute, lil cast-iron muffin pan. The tops are buttered & they melt away in your mouth. I'm not one to typically write about or indulge in the free carbs let alone accept seconds, but shamefully I did! They reminded me of my mom's only betta! 6-gems for seducing me into eating the sinfully good carbs!   The sides here are a la carte & meant to be shared according to David my server. Portion-wise, you aren't getting Chicago steakhouse \"shareable sides,\" where each side is enough to feed a family of 4. Rather, the sides here are enough for 2 small servings for 1 person or 1 serving split between 2 people.   I love mushrooms & Craftsteak has a gemtastic selection of different types of shrooms to choose from rather than just your standard sauteed portobello or button shrooms. I ordered the hen of the woods mushrooms. These shrooms are lil hearty/meaty clusters that are earthy & rich-tasting. You don't get a whole lot for $15, but I don't see them on many steakhouse menus, so they were worth it. Get them if you go here, 5-gems!  I also ordered a side of hand-cut french fries that had a smoked paprika & sherry vinegar seasoning on them. I don't normally order fries with steak but the seasoning profile sounded interestingly good, plus the rolls had me craving more carbs, aghh! I'm glad I did though cuz my intuition was right. These fries are bomb! The fries were hand-cut, soft & potatoey with crisp edges & was an awesome-tasting spice/flavor combo. Mr. Colicchio doesn't give you a whole lotta these guys for $12 but taste wise, 5-gems!   My protein: I special requested a 6 oz, center-cut, prime filet mignon off the menu. They don't have one listed on the menu, only a 10 oz size & I didn't want that big of a steak. I ordered my steak my usual way, medium-rare & it came out in a sizzlin' cast iron skillet with a small vidalia onion on the side. Temperature wise, my steak was prepared on point to a perfect medium-rare, but it didn't wow me for $70. The steak was good but the flavor was nothing extraordinary. It didn't melt in my mouth & I did see some fat laced in it, boo! This steak doesn't hold a candle to the steaks at either Gibson's or Chicago Cut, my 2 fave steakhouses in Chicago. But the steak was accurately prepared & cutely presented & overall good, so 3.5 gems!   For dessert, I chose the Chocolate Souffle & scoop of hazelnut chip ice cream ($15). It was a tiny, light, airy cake served in a lil ramekin alongside a tiny dollop of hazelnut chip ice cream. This is an ideal, happy ending if you want a chocolate-type dessert that's not too heavy or filling. It's not very big at all nor rich or overly sweet but is a top-notch, complementary-tasting duo.  Lastly, the ambience here is upscale, casual/dressy & I had my own reserved private, cool booth/table. Unfortunately, the service here left a bad taste in my mouth though. My server David started out strong, like he knew what he was doing, but then when we said give us a few minutes & come back, he took that as the green light to go MIA the remaining time. He was friendly the couple times we saw him but was lacking in the attentive department. Little does David know, patience is not my virtue, especially when I'm hungry! I abhor flagging down other wait staff to get refills, meals & bills! If I was Tom Colicchio, I would have you pack your knives & let you go. You definitely wouldn't make it waiting at a steakhouse in the Windy City. We expect high prices & great steaks but not service that is nearing shitty!  My whole meal was a gemlicious, high 4-gems, service was 2-gems & my entire rating=3+gems! In sum, if you want the best steaks & service head to the Midwest & go to almost any steakhouse in Chicago, IL, my top choices being Gibson's or Chicago Cut. If you wanna go to a celebrity-owned steakhouse that serves stellar, free dinner rolls & pricey, yummy sides from a lackadaisical waitstaff go to Craftsteak in Vegas.",

    "text": "When I learned that my husband would be attending CES in Las Vegas, I decided to join him for the sole purpose of eating at Craftsteak. I spent months drooling over the menu, scanning photos online, reading reviews, and planning what I would order. I have never been so excited for any meal in my life, as I was for this. It was everything I hoped it would be. The wait staff was polished, solicitous, and very knowledgeable. The atmosphere was elegant, warm, and a little playful, too. Eric, our food waiter, made sure to ask us what time constraints we might have. Our drinks waiter helped my husband and his brother find the perfect whiskey flights for their tastes. My husband savored his samples all evening long. My wine flight was luscious, and paired perfectly with each course. Before my first course, I indulged in the house rolls. While I didn't want to take up valuable real estate in my stomach with bread, I simply couldn't help myself from eating 2 of the delicious, buttery rolls. Yum! My first course was the Maine Lobster Bisque. It was rich, creamy, and delightful. I've never had tarragon before, and it was a delicious little adventure for my tastebuds. My main course was the Surf 'n Turf with Filet Mignon and lobster. The filet was divinely tender, and the lobster was beautifully rich. My original plan had been to order a Risotto. I have watched enough seasons of Top Chef to know that THIS would be the place for risotto. Sadly, it is a seasonal offering, and it was no longer on the menu. So I will have to wait for the chance to indulge in that delicacy. But I was in for a simply delightful treat. The GRITS! WHITE CORN GRITS, PROSCIUTTO, GRUYER! A. MA. ZING! I had trouble sharing those grits with the rest of my table. I could eat those every day, for the rest of my life. I wrapped up my meal with the Cinnamon Monkey Bread. A definite must. I make monkey bread every year for Christmas morning breakfast. I will have to step up my game, if I am to ever be satisfied with Christmas breakfast again. Hands-down, the most memorable and delicious dining experience of my life. Thank you, Craftsteak!",

For entrees, we got the wagyu surf and turf, 16 oz NY strip, 10 oz filet and scallops. The scallops were amazing. Absolutely amazing. The other girls all loved theirs as well. For sides, we got corn, grits, potato puree, assorted mushrooms, and Maui onions. The potato puree was absolutely incredible, just like every other Yelp review says. I will dream about these!! For the first time ever, we were too stuffed for dessert but the monkey bread or peanut butter chocolate lava cake sounded incredible.",

We started out with a dozen oysters, shrimp cocktail, and  sides like risotto and corn for the kids.  I only had the oysters but that was all I needed because it was so fresh and delicious. It was so delicious that we ordered a half more. One tip of warning is that the horseradish is really strong.  Next up was the main course which was the beef that everyone ordered. I had the domestic wagyu filet mignon...it was godly. Easily the tenderest beef I have had. It was like cutting into butter. Besides the meat we had an assortment of sides like potato puree, corn, asparagus, and cauliflower. Everything was cooked to perfection.   I enjoyed the service and am rice that was set it was created as a lively but intimate setting even in Vegas. There was a server for every different dish.

    "text": "On a recent visit to Las Vegas we decided to have a 5-star dinner. We wanted excellent food, excellent service, and an excellent environment. We decided on Steaks and chose Tom Colicchio's, more for the proximity to our rooms than anything else. Las Vegas has become a town of overpriced mediocrity, but Tom Coliccio's, while expensive delivered a fantastic experience.  We chose the chefs selection which consisted of a great selection of apps and sides, but the reasons you go to a steak house is not for the sides so let's talk steaks. We had the Wagyu Flank to start, it was a great piece of meat and carried a wonderfully rich flavor. Next was the Kobe Filet Minion, this was incredibly tender, soft, delicate and gentle on the pallet. Then we moved onto the Kobe New York. Let me say I have had my fair share of New York's, dry aged, Kobe, thick and thin, $10 to $100. The New York steak from Tom Colicchio's was cooked a perfect medium rare, it was season but ever so lightly to highlight but not overpower the steak. It was my favorite of the night and a steak I will not soon forget. It was clear that the kitchen had mastered their craft while using the best equipment for the task. The location in the MGM Grand is good but does not feel like like a traditional steak house, something I found myself missing a bit. This was soon forgotten when the steaks arrived. If you are on a budget this may not be the place for you.  But if you want a memorable meal, enjoy!",

    "text": "The hubby and I came in for dinner the other night and enjoyed being stuffed to the brim. Since we couldn't decide between the Domestic Wagyu Ribeye and the Aged Bone-in Ribeye, we decided to get both.  Both ribeyes were excellent, but our favorite was definitely the Wagyu, the flavor is absolutely decadent. If we had not ordered the two ribeyes side by side, I would have also been thoroughly impressed with the aged ribeye as well.  Lobster Bisque - this is lobster bisque done right, I loved the chunks of lobster and the tarragon in the soup was an excellent touch  Potato Puree - you know this is not going to be you standard mashed potatoes just looking at it, it was rich and flavorful and the perfect side for the ribeyes  Our waiter was fantastic and a blast to talk to.  The only issue I had was with the hostess, we had a reservation but still ended up waiting for our table, even though a fourth of the restaurant was empty.",

If water glasses got to low, someone was there instantly to refill. If wine got to low, same thing. Everyone was super friendly and attentive. It was amazing.   For appetizers, we had Beef Tar-Tar, Oysters, and two types of salad, plus rolls. The Beef Tar-Tar was delicious, and the salads were fresh and crisp. Our main course was a selection of Wagyu Skirt Steak, Filet Mignon, Lobster Tail, and another cut of steak that I'm currently blanking on, with sides of mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms and spinach. It was all served family style so that everyone could try some of everything. I have never had such great pieces of steak...ever. The skirt steak was definitely the winner of the three cuts. The mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth amazing, and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. For dessert, it was a selection of ice creams, gelatos, apple crisp, and sweet potato cheesecake...all of which was out of this world delicious.   For anyone staying in Vegas and in need of a great steak, I highly recommend this place!!",

    "text": "Made a reservation on Open Table and got seated right away. We were staying at the MGM and decided to find a good dining establishment right here in the hotel for the convenience. CRAFTSTEAK did not disappoint!  Food:  1) Roasted Beet Salad $13: this dish was beautifully presented. My favorite part of this dish was the pickled egg that was dyed pink. The acid definitely brought out the sweetness in the beets.  2) Butternut squash soup $16: They bring out a soup bowl with pancetta lining the bottom of the bowl. Then they pour your butternut squash soup into your bowl. The soup was creamy and delicious.  3) Wagyu Skirt Steak $78: Heeding the recommendations of several Yelp reviews, I landed on the Wagyu Skirt steak. I love skirt steak because you can really taste the beefiness. What made this skirt steak so special was that not only was the flavor on point, it was SOOO tender! I usually have problems chewing on beef because of some dental issues but with this steak, there were no issues at all. I was able to savor every bite and enjoy it. This was the best skirt steak I have ever tried.  4) Angus Rib Eye $55: a nice hunk of beef! I usually get rib eye whenever I can but I was happy that my partner ordered this. It was meaty and fatty, just how a rib eye should be.  5) Our sides approx $13 each: maui onion, yukon gold puree, prosciutto butternut risotto: we enjoyed each of the sides that we ordered.   6) Monkeybread with banana ice cream $15: It didn't take much convincing to order this dessert. Wish it came with more ice cream though!  Total cost of dinner came out to about $300 after tip. We definitely had food leftover and packaged it up to go. It was STILL very tasty the next day!!!",

    "text": "Meat! Meat! Meat!  Now I am ruined on delicious steaky bits for the next few months, at least! Or until the memory of the food from here fades. I had dined at Colicchio and Son's on our last visit to NY and it was amazing. The service was out of this world. So naturally, I wanted to try this place out when we were in Vegas.  Our server was lovely. She recommended the chefs tasting menu and the mid level wine pairing, so that's what we went with. Good lord, it was a ton of food. You need to come hungry. Wave after wave of food hit the table and everything was seasoned well, bright, full of flavor and worked well together. My favorites were the lobster bisque served in a adorable little pot, the fingerling potatoes, the mushroom medley, the prosciutto, and a lovely persian cucumber salad with lots of crunchy veggies.  Beware of the little rolls they bring out that are covered in butter and sprinkled with salt. They are addictive and you will have stuffed 3 in your mouth before you know what happened.  We did the wagyu beef and shared the sirloin and the ribeye. It was heaven. I'm kind of sad thinking about it right now because the MGM is so far from Dallas.  For dessert I was too full to do anything but graze. That being said, I did manage to get a few bites of the monkey bread with banana ice cream. It's sinful. The chocolate mousse comes with adorable little cow cookies and the fruit plate was vibrant and a nice light treat.   Looking around the restaurant, they have all of these cow paintings done in a funky head shot style.  I loved them. It's very open inside, but the low lighting and atmosphere still leans towards romantic. I love the chairs in the front bar area - think leather arm chairs with small tables so you lounge in comfort while you wait.   I can't wait to come back.",

I've had heirloom salads before, but this was just perfect. That tomato salad is what earned the 5th star here. I can't say enough about it!!  The wine list and cocktail menu comes on an iPad. Frankly, I thought it was a little distracting, especially in the dimly lit restaurant. I think a paper list would have been sufficient.  Our servers were excellent, which you expect for the price you'll pay at a place like this.  Here's a little tip, especially if you're staying at the Signature. You will get a good amount of food here, and it is all very rich. Don't be bashful about getting the leftovers boxed up. They make for easy reheating and an excellent breakfast in the morning! Just call housekeeping from your room to bring you a skillet and some utensils.",

I'm a HUGE fan of Tom Colicchio, so I had high expectations.   I came here with my family for my birthday. The hostess was sweet and inviting, unlike a lot of Vegas airheaded hostesses that work on the Strip. From the moment we sat down, our server was warm and friendly.   The lobster bisque was dare I say... too flavorful. I suppose if you love an intense seafood flavor, go for it. The butternut squash was a better pick, and less rich because you are going to get an EXTREMELY rich second course! The wagyu skirt steak was amazing, and exactly what I expected, buttery and filled with flavor. Unfortunately by the second course I was already extremely full. The rissotto was well done, a little too mac-n-cheesy though. The complimentary birthday dessert was a nice touch in the end.   But still... I don't know if Tom Colicchio had any say in the staffing, but the service was truly impeccable, probably the best I've ever had ANYWHERE.",

We both had the American wagyu to celebrate and my god, that skirt was the best compromise of quality and price ever. Fantastic at every bite, you could feel the marbled fat melt into tender, buttery meat. Foodgasm that brough silence to the table. The ribeye (which was double the price) was delicious but lost out some of it's flavor due to the fact that it was just sooooo thick. That cut was close to 3 inches thick and made it hard to be a consistent medium all around.   Mussels were good although I wish there was spoons to taste the rich wine broth. The risotto we ordered as a side went untouched once the steak got here- flavorful and buttery but forgettable even with chunks of bacon inside.   The service was pretty perfunctory, it wasn't that they didn't try to stop by but it felt rushed and a little insincere since there were just so many other tables they had to pay attention to. There was also a fly that kept visiting our table- when you're dropping over $300 on a meal, you shouldn't be waving flies away.   The atmosphere and logistics was what failed the most here though. The LA Craft is romantic, with beautiful layout, quiet atmosphere and amazing service. The tables here are so close, I had to tuck my purse in close next to me so it wouldn't touch the man in the booth next to me. You had trouble getting in and out of inside seats for fear you would brush up against people's dinner plates. The worse were the lounge style dinner tables right out by the front. Total failure of keeping that upscale feel when you feel like you're being packed in like money sardines. If they could give me the LA feel with that delicious wagyu, I'm all Tom's.",

    "text": "Went there on 8/28/2016.  In one sentence, I thought it was very good, but but a few things could be improved imo. First off, I'll mention that the website doesn't list any price. In this day and age this hard to justify.  I was by myself. They sat me at a table where on one side is a chair, and the other side is a couch. I sat on the couch, to find that is was actually uncomfortable: kinda too deep, with no good back support). Sitting on the chair meant facing a white wall, so I sucked it up and stayed on the couch. Take those couches away Tom, they're terrible.  To begin I had the heirloom tomato salad. Just an array of heirloom tomatoes with olive oil. That was pretty good.  I ordered the domestic ribeye wagyu. It was phenomenal and cook perfectly.  The first side I had was the mushroom assortment. It was perfect with the steak.  The second side was the peppers and onions. That was pretty disappointing. I guess I expected roasted peppers, but I got these super crunchy slides of pepper. Crunchy because of the skin, which isn't great. There wasn't much onion to found in that dish.  Another problem I had were the portion sizes. They're way too big. The heirloom tomato salad was supposed to be an appetizer, it actually was a meal in itself. I had to stop halfway so I could enjoy the main course later. The sides were also enormous. Combined with a 14oz boneless ribeye steak, this is truly beyond my capacity (and I'm overweight, I can take a lot). I managed to finish the steak but nothing else.  Lastly I took the Duckhorn Vineyards wine pairing option, for $75. It's basically 3 reds (two cabs and a merlot). I think it was overpriced. The first wine was Decoy cabernet sauvignon, that was a rough wine. The other wines were better but nothing spectacular. Finally I wish the sommelier would have shared his tasting notes with me.  Service was excellent.  So overall pretty good but there's work to do. If the restaurant was somewhere else than Las Vegas I would have given it 4 stars, but Vegas has tons of amazing food options within a small radius so it takes a lot to stand out.",

No worries, I know how to play the disappearing act as well.   Maybe you'll get your $$$$hit together and make it up to me one day.",

    "text": "My husband and I have dined at this restaurant twice prior to this visit and had such a great experience that we decided to return for our 14th anniversary. When we arrived at the podium to check in for our reservation, the hostess confirmed that we were return guests celebrating our anniversary. We were shown to a table and requested a booth. The hostess said she'd need to speak with her manager and she'd return shortly. Upon her return she stated that the booth's were reserved for larger parties. When I inquired about the several booths occupied by couples, she said that her manager specified that booths are for larger parties of 4. We again requested a booth from the hostess manager, explaining that it was our anniversary and again shown to another table, not a booth. We proceeded to order martini's and a bottle of wine for later. The martini's and wine were excellent, however once we finished the martini's the glasses sat on our table for a good 10 minutes after we had finished them. I know what you're thinking, that I am being overly sensitive but you have to keep in mind that we were sat at a 2 top table that was somewhat small and with all of the other dishes, glasses and cutlery, the space on this table was limited. We received a tasty lobster salad and proceeded to order the T-Bone steak and risotto to share. When the steak arrived it seemed smaller than 22 ounces and it was cold, literally cold. For $58 we expected the steak to be warm if not hot. The risotto temperature was double the temperature of the steak. Also, the Filet Mignon portion of the steak was at most 3 ounces of edible meat besides the fat. The New York portion was about 7 ounces of edible meat. Needless to say, when we told the waiter that the steak was cold, instead of removing it from the table he walked away and didn't return for about another 8 minutes. The manager came by to confirm the temperature of the steak and proceeded to remove the steak along with the plates. Pre-bussing was atrocious, at one point I had to stop staff passing by to request the removal of glass wear and plates. A new steak finally returned after 25 more minutes and was still small portions and luke warm to say the least. While we attempted to eat our new steak, we had at least 5 staff members ask how everything was within a matter of about 5 minutes. Every time we attempted to take a bite, there was someone hovering over the table, making sure everything was okay. Needless to say, they deducted the steak from our bill and offered some crazy monkey bread desert as a token for our anniversary. When we left the restaurant I again noticed 2 booths with 2 people sat which was again super annoying at this point. When I pointed out to the same hostess the 2 booths with 2 people sat, she reiterated that her manager said to extend the explanation that only larger parties are eligible to be sat at a booth. I again spoke to the manager again, whom was Christopher explaining that the hostess said that the manager stated that only larger parties are eligible for a booth, he said yes, I told her to say that. When I again pointed out the 2 tables with 2 people as well as the several booths sat with couples when we arrived, the manager said those people requested a booth. I felt like I was taking crazy pills. Christopher offered his card to email him when we come back and we left the card on the table. The food during this visit was mediocre to say the least. If we return to Craft Steakhouse, it will simply be for the martini's and possibly appetizers, not for the Steak. I truly hope whoevers reading this review has better luck with this restaurant.",

Unlike many restaurants in Vegas, our reservation meant something and we were instantly seated, where a server was already waiting for us at our table. 2. Very knowledgable about wine pairings and let my husband try a few to get just the right one.  3. Plenty of space, so it still felt intimate, yet you could still enjoy the cozy yet modern decor (Edison lights hanging, are my favorite) 4. Food was timed perfectly between courses. 5. My sea bass and his waygu filet were sensational, a party for your mouth. We had sugar snap peas and au gratin potatoes, which I am pretty sure we both wanted to lick the bowls. 6. Superior service the whole way through the meal and created a very special night out for us!",

    "text": "The evening started off so promising...  The shellfish sampler appetizer was excellent.  The dinner rolls were terrific.  The ambiance was great.  The waiter was charming.  This is the extent of nice things I have to say about Craftsteak.  The waiter was a cool guy, but pretty forgetful.  This concerned me, as he was the type who didn't write your order down.  We had a table of 7.  I knew there would be food casualties in this dinner.  My T-Bone was ordered rare and came out medium.  I'm not the type to return food, but I kinda wanted to at this price.  But it was so late in the evening and I was so hungry...plus, the group I was with are the types to wait until everyone has their food, no exceptions. So I dealt with it.  On top of the off preparation, the steak itself was very tough... not just because it was medium.  It was difficult to cut.  I have no problem spending $57 on a steak, because it is more often than not a success.  This wasn't.  It was abysmal.  My other half enjoyed his steak more than I did, but wasn't really impressed by it the way a $60 steak should be.  One last thing about the food:  All of the sides, from the vegetables to the potatoes and so on, were unbelievably salty.  Getting to the end of them proved impossible because we're talking unappetizing levels of saltiness.  The other folks at the table said they enjoyed their entrees.  I don't know, though, because few plates were left clean... some not even half consumed.  The member of our party who had recommended we go to Craftsteak had said it was his absolute most favorite steakhouse anywhere.  When he got his meal, he said it was the best steak he had ever had.  He and I had ordered the same thing.  Maybe he'd had more to drink than I did.  Service was very slow... nearly 3 hours for dinner, and it wasn't that type of dinner.  Staff was attentive and great, but sluggish.  Too many other awesome places, let alone steakhouses, in Vegas to recommend this place or ever visit it again.  Factor in the cost of two cab rides to-and-from the MGM for our party... I'd call Craftsteak a bust.",

They are serious, try not to fill up on them, but I think you will.  It's okay, happens to the best of us.  They are big league carbs.  My wife ordered the heirloom tomatoes appetizer, and we had an unfortunate incident.  The server spilled them down my wife's back, and she was wearing a white shirt, so it was beyond noticeable.  But, the manager couldn't have been more friendly about it.  She quickly offered to pay for the dry cleaning and of course replaced the dish, gratis.  So, although that was annoying, accidents happen and they handled it excellently.  The prosciutto appetizer was a table favorite, as were the shrimp.  My steak was fantastic, a big fat ribeye (if you read any of my other reviews, you will notice a pattern in my choice of steak).  Textbook medium rare  The wine list is very solid, but it's expensive.  But, if you are eating at Craftsteak, you probably weren't looking for value menu pricing.  Definitely good for a special occasion.",

There was a big mistake with our $310 steak, so we had to send it back and it made the dinner completely out of sync.  We ended up with 2 sides at the table with no main dish.   The Food: The ware frisee salad had SOOO much blue cheese that it over powered the entire salad and paired with bacon made the whole thing really salty. The brussels sprouts were also too salty. The lobster bisque and the mashed potatoes were very tasty and both had  really nice texture. We ordered the A5 Wagyu filet and requested med-rare +. It definitely didn't come out med-rare +, but it was still quite delicious.   Overall: This restaurant fell WAY below my expectations and was a major disappointment.",

They look great in the photos and in person, but there's nothing special about them.   We opted for the tasting menu for two - one with the wine pairing.  Typical wine pairings offer one glass with each course.  I cannot remember how many times they brought refills in the same course!  With the tasting menu we each had a cup of lobster bisque, three salads, two cuts of steak, three sides (one starch, two veg) and four desserts!  Entirely too much food - not complaining, but even coming in fairly hungry, we still didn't put a dent in half of it!  The two standouts of this meal? The pistachio gelatto and peach sorbet pairing and the service.  (Don't get me wrong, the lobster bisque, salads, meats and sides were phenomenal!!  Oh and I can't forget the FOUR desserts we were given!!)  But we literally sat here for almost 5 hours eating, talking and drinking and the only thing we finished were our drinks and the gelatto/sorbet!",

The potato puree was gummy and bland, and the risotto was overpowered by the flavor of prosciutto. Chef, if you're reading: it would have been great to have that delicious prosciutto crumbled on top, but I got big, chewy pieces that didn't sit well. On a high note, we loved the kale and lobster bisque. Both were full of flavor.   Overall, we had better steak at Old Homestead in Caesar's Palace.",

We decided to go for gold and get the A5 Japanese Wagyu meal for two.  The Frisee salad was amazing!  It tasted like salad carbornara; rich, eggy, with just the right amount of bleu cheese and bacon.  The filet mignon and new york strip were an experience like no other.  They literally melt in your mouth!  The assorted mushrooms were also amazing.  We learned about a new mushroom, hen of the woods, that paired perfectly with the steak.  Finally, all the desserts were amazing.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding, I couldn't stop eating the brioche bread pudding with apple pie ice cream.  I have to say something about the level of service.  They found the perfect balance of servicing us but not being intrusive.  Everyone was personable and courteous.  It's clear they all love working there and they did their best to make sure we felt right at home.  It was fairly quiet in our booth; perfect for a romantic meal.  If you're looking for a once in a lifetime steak experience, I highly recommend coming here!",

    "text": "My experience at Craftsteak was the worst I have had at an upscale steakhouse. It had nothing to do with the service, because the service was fine. It was the food that made my visit unpleasant.   The meal started off with rolls being served. They looked like Hawaiian roles, but not as sweet...and not as good.   Next was the main course. I ordered the bone in rib-eye and a side of the gratin potatoes. I asked for my steak to be medium-well, and it came out looking charred to a crisp. The server even said \"rib-eye well...errrrr...medium-well\" as he presented the plate to me. I immediately cut into the steak to see that the inside was slightly red, and it was just the outside that was extra crispy. Most of the steak tasted OK, but there were parts where it was so over cooked that it reminded me of eating a burnt marshmallow. It had that texture of being burnt to a bubbling state. I ate as much of the steak as I could, and tried to avoid as much of the burnt areas as possible.   The gratin potatoes were good, but nothing special. They came out hot, and the serving size was pretty good.   About a hour after I finished eating at Craftsteak, I had a terrible stomach ache. Granted, I had been in Vegas for a couple of days and my stomach was churning a bit from all of the buffets and drinks...but this was a different type of pain. It felt like I had a 16 pound bowling ball dropped on my stomach, and the feeling was with me ALL night. I will not be eating here again. The prices are astronomical for the experience and the sub par food. There are just so many steakhouses in Vegas that it is not worth it to tolerate a bad one.",

    "text": "The 'experience' of the restaurant was quite good. Interior and setting, etc. The waiter was great at the start, but after his first check-in after we got our main courses he sort of disappeared. When we ordered wine I told them who would be drinking it, but the wait staff (not our main waiter) still went to each and every person asking if they wanted wine, each of them needing to decline. And... hey it's not a big deal but it made for a somewhat awkward situation. Considering experiences at similar style restaurants, of similar reputation, I just would've expected a more attentive staff. At another point people's glasses had near emptied and I began to refill them. A server rushed over and actually wrestled the bottle from my hand mid-pour. It was bizarre.  The real issues, unfortunately, came with the food. Started with the Lobster Bisque which was ok. The Lobster was overdone and tough, but the soup itself was quite nice. I think the whole herbs they throw in are a bit much, they kind of stuck to my teeth as I was trying to enjoy a rather luxurious and pure soup.  On to the steaks! I had the New York, which, hey it's a standard New York strip and so I don't expect anything insane, but it was cold when it arrived and just wasn't as good as I would have expected. My girlfriend got the rather pricey Wagyu skirt on recommendation of the waiter as the best steak they have. It came rarer than ordered, and I tried a couple pieces, it just was not a great piece of beef. Luckily she liked the mashed potatoes. By contrast a nice but local hole in the wall near our home is one of her favorite steaks, also a skirt!, and for about a third of the price. I was ok with my steak, but she was just really sad about hers. I don't really care about me, but her not enjoying a meal breaks my heart.  Later on that night and the next day a lot of people were saying, \"But their side items are so awesome!\" And so we were joking for a while that it should be called Craftsides, but honestly ... the sides just weren't that good. The Robuchon style mash, sure, anything with that much butter is going to be good, but then I tried the orange colored, gloppy, Elmers glue-infused risotto. Amazingly it was the worst risotto I've had in my entire life. I was blown away how bad it was. All the other sides were good, but you know, pretty standard stuff.  It was a Sunday, it wasn't very busy, but the waiter never really came back (although he was great while he was there!), and when someone came to clear our plates a server asked if my girlfriend was done with her steak, and with 90% of the steak intact I sort of leaned in and said \"She didn't really like it...\" and he said ok and walked away with it. I didn't really care to cause a fuss in front of our group of friends, but at that point he really should have let our waiter know. I could have been forceful and really demanded her steak and the embarrassing risotto be stricken from the record, but we just wanted to leave and forget about it and go out and have fun. I wish I had said something now, of course, being a few hundred dollars poorer and nothing good to show for it, but anyway... Luckily we had good friends with us and we still had a good night.  I unfortunately can't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "After reading great reviews, we opted to come here.  We were definitely not WOW'd at the food and even disappointed a steakhouse would have such dull crappy steak knives!  Get better utensils, please, Chef Tom.  The service was alright but the food on the other hand, was disappointing!  We had intended to order the wagyu tasting menu but our waiter could not explain to us what was on the tasting and instead confused the heck out of us.   Starters: He ordered the quail and I ordered the foie gras.  The two little pieces of quail were nicely seasoned and tender but certainly did not blow us away. However, the foie gras was delicious.  The sweet candied kumquat accompanying the savory sauce created a perfect harmony with the foie gras.  We really enjoyed it.  Then...we waited for twenty minutes between our starters and main dish which really was a bit longer than we'd liked!  Entrees: I ordered the American Kobe filet mignon which was a HUGE disappointment.  I had requested for medium rare but the steak was cooked a bit more medium than I had liked.  Not to mention, the heavy handed seasoning defiled the filet.  The \"hint\" of blue cheese seared into the steak overpowered the tender cut and detracted from the meat.  He ordered the \"regular\" rib eye which was half the price of my American Kobe and it was DELICIOUS!  I don't ever regret ordering anything but boy did I absolutely wish I had ordered the rib eye too!  It was the one redeeming part of the meal thus far.  Side dishes: The Jerusalem artichokes were absolutely delicious (lots of fiber too!) It was cubed and reminded me of \"country fries\".  It was well seasoned and absolutely not oily at all.  It had great texture and the flavor was satisfying.    The Tuscan kale and smoked bacon, on the other hand, was way too salty.  We had to say something about it, and the waiter indicated that this is the response they often get when this dish is on the menu.  They took it off our bill and brought  us a different sauteed vegetable.  They explained that the smoke bacon adds the salt to the dish but as the kale sits and the sauce reduces, the overall dish becomes saltier.  YIKES, disappointing.  Dessert: I ordered the panna cotta which was an extremely sophisticated, or as my honey puts it, \"adult\" dessert.  The panna cotta is infused with jasmine. Think of the panna cotta as a delivery mechanism for the jasmine flavor. The texture adds interest.  When tasted by itself the scent of jasmine is very strong which I enjoyed but he thought was too strong.  The panna cotta sits on a macaroon and when eaten together, it is a perfect contrast of chewy and creamy (not milky tho) and the floral scent adds to the overall experience.  The serving plate is drizzled with honey and thinly sliced asian pears accompanies the dessert.  There was a lot of components and maybe even a bit too much going on, but I liked it.    He had ice cream which he called \"kiddy dessert\" - simple but excellent.  Excluding alcohol, our bill was $270, which in absolute terms isn't expensive per se, but in terms of the value we were expecting, it wasn't really worth it!    At over $110, the American Kobe filet was a BIG disappointment. At $24, the foie gras, although tasty, was a really small portion for the price.  The kale was just overall salty and blah.    I really wanted to like this place more.",

It was alittle nicer than being in the inside hall, since the lighting seemed to be brighter outside.   The atmosphere of the restaruant is very nice.. it is very calm but very professional at the same time. We started our order with Lobster Bisque. This is a must get if you have never tried it..or a fan or lobster. It taste like... wow did you melt the shell inside it too?? that is how deep and strong the flavor of the lobster is. They mean business when it comes to getting the flavor. I loved the soup! Foie Gras was also delicious, cooked very nicely and it went well with the Kumquat. The potato guratin was a little heavy, but it went well with everything.  The main course the meat... i had the Filet Mignon, which was cooked very nice, medium rare just the way i like it. Perhaps it was not the best piece of steak that I had, but none the less it was yummy!  I also have to rave about their bread! Talk about coming straight from the oven! The outside was crispy and the inside was fluffy! I think the bread was also the highlight of the evening!!",

There is no wow factor here. Purre'd mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus all cooked like every other steakhouse. I should have known better steakhouses do not try hard. There is zero creativity in this place. Poured our own wine every single time. Service was okay. I might be biased because I don't think grilled beef is worthy of high ratings.  Just boring for a wow factor bill.",

    "text": "Solid meal. Service was almost impeccable.   I took my husband here for his 30th birthday. What better place to take a dude than to a steak house right? RIGHT!  We went with the domestic wagyu chef's tasting menu. They say \"three courses\" but what they mean is you get three rounds of food piling up at your table. There were multiple appetizers, multiple steaks, and multiple desserts. If there was something you really wanted - they were pretty accommodating in making any changes.  On top of the three course meal - we also ordered a dozen little neck clams.  Appetizers + the clams came out and they were outstanding. The clams were fresh and delicious and the appetizers were really good. I hate to say this - but I'd even say the appetizers stood out more than the steak (I know... blasphemy for a steak place). The shrimp were the highlight of the appetizer section followed really closely by the clams.  The steaks: I can't remember... but we got 4 different cuts of steak and a bunch of sides - including the really delicious mashed potatoes. Although by this point, we were literally bursting to the seams. We ended up packing 1/2 away for snack later.  Dessert - 4 different desserts - although one of them is a fruit plate but I think that still counts since it wasn't just fruit cut up... At this point we were just trying to eat whatever wouldn't keep for a few hours because our stomachs were packed.  While the three course tasting was fun - I'd probably do this place a la carte. The portions were ridiculous for 2 people and I felt like I couldn't enjoy my steak as much since I was pretty much full after all the appetizers.   Overall, worth a visit - but come with a hungry stomach!",

    "text": "This review is for the Vegas Uncorked Mother's Day Brunch.    I arrived about 25 minutes early and there was already a line almost back to the casino floor.  While we were waiting they passed out Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's.  Definitely a nice way to pass the time.  When we were seated, Food Writer Alan Richman and Chef Tom Colicchio spoke about Mother's Day and the changing face of hunger in America.  It was quite special and moving to see these esteemed professionals share such an important message.  Now onto the food:  1st Course: Scones with Creme Fraiche and Market Preserves.  The Scones were so good I finished mine without putting anything on them!  Seasonal Fresh Fruit.  A nice selection of Melons, Berries and Pineapple.  Pickled Farm Egg with Roasted Beets, White Anchovy.  Never thought I'd like this, but the combination of flavors was just fantastic!  Chilled Maine Lobster and Artichoke Salad.  I KNEW I' d like this one and I Loved it!  Wild Arugula with Shaved Pecorino.Standard Salad, but the cheese took it to another level.  House Made Porchetta with Mustard Fruits. Wonderfully rich and fatty with a contrasting sweetness from the fruit.  2nd Course Belgian Waffle with Warm Fruit Compote.  My least favorite dish of the meal.  Sous Vide Eggs, Asparagus, Morels, Ramps.  Stunningly delicious.  The Morels were absolutely fantastic!  Wagyu Skirt Steak, Salsa Verde.  Tender and Flavorful.  Braised Kubuta Pork Belly.  Best Pork dish I have ever had!  It almost brought a tear to my eye.  Creamed Spinach Gratin.  Just OK.  Desserts(So full I only tried two.) Frozen Chocolate Souffle.  Rich, Creamy, Chocolatey. YUM!  Lemon Verbena Pavlova, Strawberry Sorbet. Light crispy shell, sorbet tasted just like fresh strawberries.  This was a fantastic dining experience. The restaurant is wheelchair accessible and based on the quality of the food and service, I will definitely return for dinner in the future.",

I also got the heirloom tomato salad which was huge ($16). My friend got the ceasar salad and it came with anchovies which he picked out LOL. For my starch we had the the potatoes pureed ($14) and gratin ($14). I like the puree better with the chives. The gratin had a funny sour taste to them for me. I don't know if it was the fancy cheese they used or what.   Service was impeccable. Wish he had a better table though but we took what we could get without any reservations.   You can easily spend over $100 per person here so be careful! Serving sizes are HUGE, we took everything home.",

    "text": "Wow.   I haven't written a review in months, but this place was so good that it took me out of retirement, Jay-Z style.. okay, maybe Brett Farve style? (I'm just praying not Michael Jordan style).   In any case, the food here was exceptional. If yelp allowed me to dock them a point on service, I would -- but that's just because I think 5-stars means perfection. The service was good, but not perfect. French Laundry service is perfect.   I went with 6 other guys and I luckily convinced them all to get the Wagyu tasting menu (domestic). It was expensive, especially with the cheapest wine we could fine ($67/bottle), but 100% worth it. I think it came out to be $160/person with tax and gratuity.  Because we were such a large group the chef would allow us to sample everything -- 7 different appetizers, 7 different cuts of meat, and 7 different desserts. Of course when it came time for dessert no one had any interest in eating anymore.   Peter Luger's in NYC has long held my top-spot for steakhouses, and it'll continue to do so, but just because it's so iconic and traditional. When I want to have fun and eat a ton of variety (at a steakhouse!), I'll go back to Craftsteak.  Extra notes:  - Dressy in Vegas doesn't mean dressy. Jeans and a shirt that isn't a T-shirt is totally acceptable (and normal).  - The steak tartare here was the best I've ever had in my life.  - The place is really big, and not intimate. They do have booths, but I'd skip it for a romantic date. - They have the best ice cubes in the world here.. look for an attached photo.",

The first time was with a good friend, and I was immediately impressed by the unpretentiousness of the service and the relaxed demeanor of all its clients inside. There is something also very private about the acoustics of the restaurant--as you would be able to dine with a business client and talk shop or have a louder, more boisterous time with some friends and not feel self-conscious. On my first visit, our service was excellent and the two steaks we ordered were fantastic prepared. I really recommend any of their dry-aged beef ($45-65), as the Wagyu is a little too outrageous for a simple steak dinner ($90-$110).   My second time was with a group of three others for my twenty-sixth birthday. Even though we got the last seating of the night, our service wasn't rushed and our waiter had the utmost patience with one of our slightly demanding, pretentious friend. We all ordered steaks (I never realized how amazing a dry-aged T-Bone can be) and the accompanying sides were delicious. Do yourself a favor and get a great steak in Vegas at Craftsteak. Its an awesome way to slow down the evening and enjoy yourself outside of the hustle of that MGM casino!",

    "text": "After some extensive research, I decided to dine at Craftsteak to celebrate my birthday. For the most part, it was a good meal. More on that later. My party of two were seated at a larger table against the wall, which was very nice and intimate. The service here was also attentive, and the waiter wasn't afraid to let us know what he recommended and what he didn't recommend.  We ultimately ordered:  18 oz Bone-in Ribeye - Grilled to perfection, and seasoned perfectly. It's a very memorable steak if you ask me, and I'm glad that I ordered it. I know my way around a steak (especially a ribeye), and the steak they served me was extremely tender and tasty. Couldn't ask for more, to be honest.  10 oz Hangar Steak - I had heard great things about the hangar, especially how great of a value it was. This is absolutely True. If you're a fan of a charred steak, you don't have to look further. It had a lot more char than the ribeye, and while it wasn't as tender, it was nonetheless delicious.   Hen of the Woods Mushrooms - While the mushrooms did look out of this world (They're maitake mushrooms, after all), the earthy flavor was a perfect complement to the steak. I'm not a big mushroom eater, but I must say they were tasty. The texture is very interesting, but paired with a slice of the ribeye made for a divine bite of food.  Potato Puree - If you love mashed potatoes, you'll love this. What I appreciated is that it was rich, but not overly rich in its use of butter, cream and salt.   I really wanted to give Craftsteak five stars, but there was one issue that made it impossible. Prior to our entrees, they brought freshly baked bread to the table. It was warm, fluffy, crunchy and delicious. We finished it, and they asked if we would like more. The entrees took a little longer than expected to come out, so we said sure. When we received our bill, we found that they had charged us (it was marked as \"AMUSE\" on the bill) for both orders of bread. That's $24 for bread, which is absolutely ridiculous, especially since they DID NOT let us know beforehand. If it wasn't for this, our experience would have been perfect. Be warned!",

We were also served the most delicious Brussel sprouts and Yukon gold potato puree (yum) and asparagus. We cleaned up everything! We were so full and satisfied and then they came out with a special monkey bread served for our 20th wedding anniversary AND 2 delicious sorbet flavors (mango and raspberry) AND a scrumptious chocolate cake with yummy strawberry ice cream. I had A. Berry for my drink which super delicious and hubby had a few Chimay beers. Service was awesome. Food was decadent. We truly enjoyed celebrating our anniversary here.

I'm still mulling if it makes top 3 but I been to some awesome steakhouses in NYC and one in Chicago. It's tough. But you know the steakhouse is damn good when you have to think about letting it crack your top 3 list of all time. Top 5 for sure.   Anyways we just landed in Vegas. We wore basically Hoodies and ripped jeans. We felt under dressed big time. But the waiters/employees never once made us feel we didn't belong. Service was phenomenal. They answered our questions. They talked to us in casual conversation. Again great customer service always makes the dining experience great and this place nailed that part down.   Now onto the food. I think you have to get the Wagyu cuts here. There are some other cuts but it seems that the Wagyu cuts is what Craftsteak is known for. I was torn between the Ribeye and the Skirt Steak. My friends highly recommended the skirt steak but I've never been a skirt steak guy unless I'm paying $20 bucks for it and there's the green Chimmichurri sauce on it. LOL. So I asked the waiter he recommended the skirt steak. It's around $82. FYI this place is not cheap, a little bit more than the traditional top steakhouses but what do you expect. It's VEGAS.  Anyways, the steak was AMAZING. Every bite felt like the steak was melting in your mouth. The flavor was perfection. Not to salty. Not to peppery. Just perfect. It didn't feel like I was eating skirt steak at all. Usually I've come to find skirt steak extra chewy but not here. It melted in your mouth. Also the dinner rolls that are complimentary were amazing. We ordered 3 side dishes. The mashed potatoes were great as well. While waiting and eating our food, we ordered an 18 year scotch. Only $20 for the glass. Not bad.   Anyways highly recommend. It's a bit pricey so if you're willing to spend some money or spend your WINNINGS this place is the spot to go at the MGM Grand Casino.",

What struck me about the entire meal is that every dish was good, but not a single dish evoked a reaction of OMG. They were all tasty, but not a single one was truly impressive.   For these elevated prices, you expect to have a reaction that is truly delicious, and it just wasn't there.  Even the complimentary bread was sorta ordinary, not nearly as interesting as top steakhouses. (for example, SW Steak at Wynn has a really impressive bread offering).  The Corkage was $50 for one bottle, which I consider to be a real scam. That is insulting.  So, in summary, a very nice ambience, good service, beautiful restaurant, expensive, and not impressive enough on the palate. I will admit that I did not have a normal American corn fed steak, and they might be better. My mistake was getting the Wagyu skirt steak - that was a very unimpressive taste.",

    "text": "Celebrity & James Beard chef Tom Colicchio (best known as the head judge on Top Chef) opened Craftsteak (located inside the MGM Grand) in 2002 and it has been an AAA's Four Diamond restaurant since 2006.  I had a reservation through the OpenTable and overall service was excellent. The menu include the steak tasting menu (range from $125 to $275) as well as other a la carte items (first courses, main courses, and side dishes). The portion for each side dish pretty big, so it is best to share between two ~ three people.  ***  Hand-Cut Wagyu Tartare (Crostini, $24): Well seasoned beef tartare - not a bad dish to share, but personally it was a bit pricey for what it's worth.   Complimentary Dinner Rolls with Sea Salt: Soft rolls with crusty exterior - it was decent.  N.Y. Strip (Dry Aged RR, Bone In - $49): Talk about one amazing NY steak ...  yup, it was definitely one of the best steak I have ever had from any steakhouses. Incredible steak quality (tender and juicy) with flavorful au jus. I even poured au jus over the potato puree.  Potato Puree (Yukon Gold, Chives - $15): Smooth and buttery mashed potato, but it lacked strong flavors. I have had better mashed potato, but it wasn't too shabby.  Brussels Sprouts (Bacon, Bordelaise - $15): I am no brussels sprouts expert, but it was a good veggie dish.  ***  Generous portion + mouth-watering steak = one satisfying dinner. The NY steak alone was really the only reason why I decided to give 5-star instead of 4-star. I had an excellent experience at Craftsteak and hopefully one day I will get to visit another Tom Colicchio's signature restaurant - Craft (one in New York and another one in Los Angeles).",

It was cooked to perfection and was absolutely a high quality cut of ribeye.  It is quite expensive, I was in a party of 3 and we all had a steak/1 side order each/a few drinks and the total bill was about $500+ tip.

    "text": "***My 200th YELP review***  Being a huge Top Chef fan I had high expectation for Mr Colicchio's restaurant and it did not disappoint! Everything from check in to service to the food was top notch, a fantastic steakhouse experience.   We arrived at 5:30 and were quickly seated in a large booth along the back wall. The restaurant its self is as expected, dark and classy with both tables and booths. Our server team of Patricia and Fabio were outstanding. Both provided us over the top service from beginning to end. We started off with a couple glasses of wine while Patricia went over the menu. Fresh, hot parker house rolls topped with sea salt arrived in a cast iron dish. This was a good start!   They have a tasting menu but we opted for a la carte. We started with splitting a caesar salad which was a great tip as its plenty big for two to share. We both ordered the 10 oz Double R filet along with the infamous potato puree, mushroom risotto and sweet butter corn.   The caesar was excellent. I asked for anchovies on the side and they were brought out in a dish of olive oil. They were also pickled which made them extra tasty! Overall the salad was good. The rest of the food came out and the filets were also served in a cast iron dish which were cooked perfectly medium rare. I immediately scooped some potato puree on my plate with much anticipation. It was so worthy of their reputation, absolutely some of the best potatoes I have ever had. I don't want to know how much butter and cream is in those but the silky smooth texture was worth every calorie.   The risotto and corn were also excellent. After savoring every bite we HAD to look at the dessert menu. It wasn't to appealing to me so I just ordered some caramel banana ice cream which was really really good. My other half had the chocolate peanut butter lava cake. It was good but not the best lava cake we have had.   Overall this was definitely a 5 star dining experience. Excellent staff and service and delicious well prepared food, can't ask for much more than that!",

From the hostess to the waiter, we had attentive and pleasant staff.  This was our first time visiting and we essentially had to be rolled out--everything was wonderful.  We chose a dinner option for two in which the chef prepares three courses tailored to your liking.  Each course was a surprise.  There was a ton of variety (we chose a land and sea option).  Enjoyed a delicious lobster bisque that made me want to lick the bowl.  Blue cheese salad with egg was bomb!  Our steaks were juicy.  We enjoyed both a filet mignon and NY strip.  I was able to observe the difference in taste and texture of the meat.  Both prepared so well, vastly different, but I couldn't settle on which was best.  Both Yummy!  I fell in love with the wild mushroom side dish.....incredible.  Our lobster dish was great too, soft and buttery.  Just melted in my mouth.  We enjoyed an array of desserts, but hands down the monkey bread is to die for.  Overall, a devilishly sinful time in sin city!  Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Overall, a very nice dinner.  The best attribute of this restaurant is the friendly, efficient and thoughtful service. I was especially impressed that our server asked whether we had a show reservations of any other time limitation.  The beverages orders were brought out very timely; I enjoyed the apple-pear hard cider, in particular. Also I enjoyed the bread served in the skillet. The bit of salt was nice, but I would have liked a small dish of salt on the side to add a bit more.  The caesar salad was very nice, consisting of crispy pieces of romaine with a generous serving of anchovy, although I did feel that the dressing was rather light and not very strong in flavor.  The lobster bisque was served table-side with the creamy soup added to the fresh ingredients in the bowl...a very nice touch!  The potato puree was delicious and the chives added nicely to the flavor.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the New York Strip. Although the natural sauce in the serving dish helped the flavor, overall, the steak seemed under-seasoned and a bit dry.  The Monkey Bread was delicious, but I would have preferred the extra pecans on the side, because there was a generous serving of pecan on the bread and then the smallish scoop of ice cream was sort of held hostage by a moat of additional pecans surrounding it.  Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience and I suspect perhaps a different cut of meat may have resulted in a better steak, so I'll try a different cut next time.",

CraftSteak does not do anything about it.  They don't validate.  That being said, we were lead to our table by an unsmiling hostess.  After replacing a wobbly chair we sat down to a great meal.  The service was friendly, unobtrusive, and efficient.   I had the bone in New York Strip medium rare.  It was prepared just as ordered. The flavors were excellent.  The spinach cane with lots of extra garlic just as we asked.  The mashed potatoes were really good.  The gift of a side of grits with cheese and bacon was well appreciated.  As a New Englander, I have not had much of those. The space is sedate and classy.  The patrons were all mostly well dressed. That was a relief from the people out in the casino who were dressed like an explosion at the goodwill store. All in all it was a very pleasant evening with good friends.  The only drawback was the parking.  With the nickel and diming the corporate resorts are doing, locals will be needed to replace the droves of tourist who have been turned off on what used to be a great Las Vegas experience.",

It didn't. Not even close.  Not one thing stood out to me. Don't get me wrong, nothing I had was bad but at the same time, nothing I had would bring me back to the restaurant.  We got the Double R Beef for $125 per person. Basically it's a tasting menu but all dishes are from the menu. You get to pick what you want from the menu. So between the two of us, we got 3 first courses, 2 mains, 3 sides and 3 desserts. Not everything comes full order but it definitely was enough food for the two of us.  All the ingredients were high quality and everything was cooked perfectly but everything was very basic and traditional. I feel like I can get the same meal at any other steakhouse like Ruth's Chris.  Service was good and the meal went smoothly. If you like traditional steakhouses this would be a great place for you. If you like something a little more creative and different, I would suggest to try Gordon Ramsay Steak.",

The service was polite and friendly, multiple managers introduced themselves to the table to let us know they were available if we needed anything. Our waiter was great, I can't remember his name at the moment, an older gentleman.   The portions were huge and oh so delicious. We ordered the Buffaloes chicken mozzarella salad, chicken, steak, potato puree, and asparagus. Bread was brought to our table, the most delicious fluffy buns!!! I still dream of the potato puree, and my chicken was perfect! I'm not a steak person, I didn't even try my boyfriends steak but he loved it and couldn't stop taking bites of my chicken. It's hard to find chicken at a restaurant that's cooked just right without being dry. My chicken was crisp on the outside, but tender and juicy on the inside. We will be returning soon!",

    "text": "Note-In reviewing my reviews of restaurants, I noticed that I left a fair amount of four star reviews in my early days. Recently, I broke down the metrics which I consider when assigning a restaurant a score, in order to make sure that arbitrary scores are not given. My metrics-1. Ambience 2. Service 3. Food Quality 4. Food:Degree of Difficulty.  These four metrics are what I take into consideration when assigning a score, and I will try to ground my reviews in that language:)   Okay, now for My review of Craftsteak. OMG      The restaurant is inside the (MASSIVE) MGM Grand, and the ambience is lovely. Interesting lighting, tables with a simple candle and unique votive, and placemats. Booths line the exterior of the restaurant, and the overall ambience is intimate and lovely. Our servers were stellar-attentive, responsive, and helpful in suggesting items. They were swamped with some huge groups, but they made a point to check on us, and we were visited by the manager at the end of the night. Excellent service.  And now the food. Oh, the food. I picked Craftsteak for our group to try because of my love of Top Chef. I am a Tom Colicchio fan and was excited to visit his restaurant. It did not disappoint. We started with beverages from the massive, 60 page drink menu. I chose a simple white wine (potential blasphemy at a steakhouse, but we needed up with some seafood later, so it worked) Our waitress explained the family style approach of the menu, and we ordered many items as a result of her recommendations. As a group of 3, we shared the Heirloom Tomato salad. So fresh, so clean-just gorgeous. Ingredients are fresh daily, and it shows. Rolls come to the table during appetizer time, and the rolls were so so good. Hard and crusty tops with salty and buttery goodness match with soft and dough-y little bottoms. So great! Main Course-we three shared Skirt Steak, Scallops, Corn, and Hen of the Woods Mushrooms. I will start with the mushrooms-they were interesting and well-seasoned, but they were not my favorite. They were good, for sure, but let me tell you about the other items:) Our scallops were perfect-buttery, seated perfectly, and absolutely scrumptious. The corn-ya'll...I don't even LIKE corn. I am ambivalent at best about corn. And this blew my mind. So sweet, so flavorful-so scrumptious. And then the skirt Steak-our server made note of it, and she said that this is not your typical \"fajita skirt Steak\" and she was so right. It was charred but buttery, and it melted. This steak-again, I am not even a huge fan of Steak-was an absolute winner. And it should be shared-we 3 shared this and had plenty each. Finally, we capped the night with dessert. Mango cheesecake-it was creamy and rich and so good! And bread pudding-this was a STAR. Sugary, crisp top and gooey, warm pudding that was a dream. Craftsteak was an experience. It was a delight, and it was top notch. Make it a point to eat here when in Vegas",

Start: warm frisee, Caesar salad, prosciutto San Daniele, and the shrimp cocktail. Awesome start!  The meat: Domestic wagyu filet, skirt, and ribeye. They ribeye and the skirt were by far my favorite. So buttery and rich. I'm not much of a filet fan because it lacks the fat and we all know fat=flavor.   Sides: Brussels, red pepper risotto, and potato puree. All of which were perfection.   Dessert: monkey bread, tropical vanilla cheesecake, trio of ice cream, and caramel chocolate mousse. By this point, there had been so much food that I think we all had a meat high.   Overall, this was amazing and I think I may have some clogged arteries. All worth it.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointing. We came here with a friend who lives in Las Vegas and who recommended Tom Colicchio' Craftsteak. We wanted a nice place to chat and catch up that offered good food. Our waiter Peter was less than useless. He spent all of the night in a perpetual state of confusion. Maybe it was because we brought our kids with us? Or the fact that the background music was blaringly loud. In fact we asked if they could turn down the music and Peter said he was having trouble hearing our request, then he informed us that music level adjustment was beyond his pay grade. So his confusion could just have been a combination of loud music and poor hearing on Peter's part. I ordered the restaurant week specisl, as I ordered also for my kids to split. They had chicken that was dry and pretty bland. I had the steak, it was ok but nothing special. We had 2 sides each and 3 of the 4 were just barely ok, the others were kind of over cooked and mushy - maybe they are trying to cater to the older retiree crowd? My wife's dish and our friends dishes were also similarly uninspiring - especially for the price. Our friend commented that the food and service was definitely off that night, as he frequents the restaurant regularly. The dessert was the standout though compared to the rest of the meal. Honestly its not worth the premium price. Thus I was very disappointed.",

Recently,  with reservation, we were ignored and passed by Christopher as we were awaiting seating. Others there seemed to be seated before us as they handed Christopher a tip.  He smelled of alcohol and I was quite taken back by his behavior.  I spoke before dinner to Denise about this and she told me that she would get back to me but was condescending and appeared aloof. Never did hear back  Service was quite ordinary. This is a far cry from what I've experienced in the past. One of my party at dinner told me that she had seen the managers talking to our waiter and suspected that this was part of the reason that we were treated in a manner that was far below our expectations and what we previously experienced.   I can assure you that  this will not happen again as we will not be returning until this situation is remedied. We are frequent guests and hope that attention is to this matter",

Two of the three times I've been here I haven't been able to eat much of the steak because I'm so full from the previous courses. Be sure to come hungry if you go this route.  The most recent time I was here they had fresh corn, which is apparently one of their special dishes that they only have a few weeks out of the year. They seemed really stoked about it, so I ordered it, wondering how someone gets excited about ...corn.  GET EXCITED ABOUT CORN!! It was the best corn I've had in my life - I mean, I'm seriously still telling people about it. Yes. Corn. You must order it if it's available when you go. (And you should definitely go.)",

If you are a big fan of Top Chef on the Bravo, Tom Colicchio is the head judge of the show and just so happens to own Craft LA, Craft NYC, and 'Wichcraft.  The ambiance is elegant and you have your choice to sit in either a booth, table, or couch seats. There is also a bar that looks small when you enter (it is shaped like an \"L\").   Other than that, you can pretty much order anything here! The steaks are cooked to perfection. I would also suggest ordering the fries or mushrooms. If you're feeling game, you must try the oysters from Russia if they are available. Your meal could run around $80-100 per person if appetizers are in your order. Expect to drop about $200 per person if you're planning to order the Kobe steak!  Definitely worth visiting if you are in town!",

    "text": "So you're in the market for some good meat in Vegas?  Not the kind that dances on stage and makes you fork out the dollar bills, but the scrumptious, carnivorous satisfaction that comes perfectly prepared on a plate of goodness. Yes. THAT kind of meat.  Your YELP search for great steak stops here.  When I go to a restaurant, I look around at the other patrons. \"What type of people does this place attract?\"  Does the Sushi restaurant only have Japanese patrons?  Do you hear people order in Spanish at this small taco joint?  You know a steakhouse is legit when there are groups of men that come into eat together.  Grown-ass, men. Gathering to feast on the most primal of foods... red meat.  Sure, you can judge me for judging these restaurants, but that's why we're on Yelp anyways, right?  If it's your first time and you don't mind spending a few Benji's on dinner, I suggest the domestic wagyu course meal.  This applies for parties of two or more and it's $140 per person.  Yes, it's not cheap.  But you get a full course meal from appetizers to entrees, and even desserts of the chef's choice.    That's the easy way -- hand over full control to the chef and perhaps the suggestions of your server and let the party begin. However, if you're a control-freak like I am, you will at least want some say in what you'll be enjoying.   So, here a list of what you might get if you order a domestic wagyu course meal for two people:  * indicates favorites  First Course: *Prosciutto San Daniele served with Figs *Maine Lobster Bisque Caesar Salad (served with anchovies -- but you can ask for it on the side) Heirloom Tomatoes served with olive oil & basil  Second Course: (choose two cuts for a two person meal, three cuts for three, four cuts for four, etc.) 14 oz. New York Strip 14 oz. Ribeye * 14 oz. Skirt steak 10 oz. Filet Mignon 8 oz. Flat Iron  Side Dishes: Mushroom assortment Risotto White corn grits  Desserts: Chef's choice of about 3 - 4 from the dessert menu. They are ALL amazing.  I always have a great experience here.  Food, service, atmosphere = all fantastic. I love how it's classy but not pretentious.  I don't take this as a flip flops and hawaiian shirt type of place, however, I've seen people wear jeans with a nice shirt & blazer and that was okay.  If I had to choose ONE thing to eat here, it would be their skirt steak.  It's not the most expensive cut nor would I order skirt steak anywhere else (I'm a ribeye type of girl).  But their skirt steak is unlike any other.  I highly recommend this place.  Make reservations in advance. If not THE best, the one of the best places to get steak on the Vegas strip.",

My 2 friends and I came here for a girl's night and ordered 3 steaks and 3 sides. We all shared.  Filet: so disappointing. Dry! And we ordered it medium rare. I've had better at 3 star places. Hangar steak: very good, only one any of us liked. Still nothing to inspire a return trip by itself. Third steak that was also just flat and flavorless. Can't even recall what it was now. If I do recall it will just be to tell you what to avoid.   You know what was excellent though? The sides. We had Brentwood corn and Fiddlehead fern special sides and a potato dish that was a menu staple. The first two were life altering great as promised by our server.  My advice; go here and have a vegetarian meal of special sides recommended by your server and you will love it here, skip the steak. Service was very good too of course. Place looks very Vegas hotel and is, of course clean. For such a huge restaurant we had a nice table and it wasn't noisy in any way.",

The service here is just excellent and super attentive-we had 2 servers for our table-cray cray!  We ordered scallops, 18 oz ribeye, 10 oz filet mignon, asparagus, and fingerling potatoes.  Everything was tasty.  My sister was raving about this pineapple mixed drink that was just delicious!  The scallops were huge and their bread & butter was so good!  The ribeye was grilled and the filet mignon was roasted.  The meat came pre cut, which I prefer, because I don't like to work for my meal!  Both of the meats were cooked to our liking-I actually prefer it a bit less done-medium rare, but I know that my mom likes to eat it medium well, so we went with that.  They have this lady that came and asked if we wanted to purchase pictures.  We said sure and my mom was able to haggle the lady for a cheaper price! It comes in a nice leather folio and the pictures turned out great.  You can view it before they put it in the folio.  We finished off with these complimentary kit kat/rice crispy looking treats.  Overall, the best steakhouse I've been to!  It is a bit pricier, but so worth it!  Will definitely be coming back here again next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Excellent service and steak, even though mine was not done correctly the first time. I ordered my filet mignon medium rare, and it came out cooked medium-medium well, which may sound like a small difference, but in a $50 steak, it really does change the experience. Fortunately, my server was quick to get it replaced with the correct steak, and it was amazing! They also brought by a bourbon glazed bread pudding topped with apple pie ice cream on the house to apologize for the mishap. All in all a great experience - the only feedback I'd give is that reservations seem to slip on time here, as in, I had a 7:15 reservation, and wasn't seated until closer to 7:25 despite checking in at 7:05. It did seem like a busy restaurant, but that's just something they should be mindful of as they move forward.",

All the servers and workers that we had always had top notch customer service. If you're looking to goto a fine dining restaurant with excellent customer service, I HIGHLY recommend Craftsteak.  We did the Domestic Wagyu Surf & Turf three course menu this time around and the food was excellent. We also paired our dinner with some wine, and they definitely poured a good amount for us to last through the night. To start off, we had Caesar Salad, Beet Salad, Warm Frise, and their Lobster Bisque. The salads weren't dressed too heavily which I loved and all the flavors worked together. The lobster bisque was also super flavorful as well. Along with our steak and lobsters, we ordered their asparagus, mashed potatoes, and mushrooms on the side. Everything paired PERFECTLY together and both steak cuts were cooked to perfection (we love that perfect medium rare!). The steaks came pre cut which made it much easier to share and try both steaks with my boyfriend. We were almost too full for our last course dessert, but we tried their sorbets and ice creams which was very refreshing after the meal.   It was a wonderful experience dining with CraftSteak for our special occasions, and we will definitely be coming back. The customer service was SUPERB from everyone, and our server checked up on us the right amount of times to make sure everything was going well. CraftSteak is a must goto no matter what reason you're in Vegas for!",

My husband and I enjoy a nice meal and a good steak and knew Vegas would not disappoint, we spent almost a week looking at reviews of steak houses and trying to decide the perfect one, we had decided on Gordon Ramsay steak house but our plans for the day happened to change and we were in the MGM Grand already, so we decided to just pick a place there. We weren't dressed up and were concerned upon walking in but the host was very welcoming and got us seated right away. Our server DAN was so friendly and explained the menu to us, we chose the chefs tasting with the domestic Wagyu  mind you we do not mind paying for a good meal. This was about 170 a person and based on a la cart options was a good deal. We told him how we wanted it cooked and things that we loved and would not eat, (ex..my husband hates blue cheese) he took it from there. We expected good food but this went above and beyond our expectations. Everything was absolutely perfect! We will def be returning when we can and we I'll be referring everyone! Expect to have a large check but also expect to have the best meal of your life!",

    "text": "Went to craftsteak last Friday night, with a group of 25. Surprisingly we were able to get reservations the day of. Craft accommodated us with two tables. One table decided to order from the menu, whereas my table had the Summer Tasting menu. The waiter warned that this wasn't any ordinary tasting menu, where you'd have to stop by McDonald's on the way back. For $60, they bring out the following, served family style:  FIRST COURSE  Shaved Fennel Salad Grilled Quail, Vincotto Buffalo Mozzarella with Red Pepper Caponata Persian Cucumber Salad  MAIN COURSE  Prime Beef Flat Iron Angus Skirt Steak Diver Sea Scallops  SIDE DISHES  Yukon Gold Potato Puree Sauteed Sweet Corn Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms  DESSERT  Chef's Selection  Everything was 100% on point. Quail was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Buffalo mozzarella was nice and creamy, and definitely went well with one of their complementary rolls. That night, the prime beef flat iron steak was substituted for a NY, which was good to have paired with the buttery skirt steak. Sides, lobster bisque, everything was excellent.  The only semi-complaint was a little bit of sand with the scallops, but hell, they were huge, and you know they're fresh. Our table was also shorted a scallop, so the waiter promptly brought out another full order, on the house.  Admittedly we were skeptical about what the \"Chef's Selection\" was for dessert, but, like the two courses before, craftsteak didn't disappoint. The servers came out with a huge sampling of sorbets, ice creams, chocolate lava cakes, cheesecakes, monkey bread, and rhubarb cobbler. All of that food, for only $60?! I would've easily paid double that amount and still given this place 5 stars.  Also got to try the beef short ribs, which melts in your mouth, as well as most of the other types of beef on the menu not named \"wagyu\". All in all, hands down the best meal I've ever had, best restaurant I've ever been to, best service I've ever experienced (especially with everyone in our group being under 30).",

    "text": "My husband and I went to dinner here for our anniversary and based on the reviews here were really excited to try it.  Now we wish we would have went elsewhere.  The food was below average for a moderate-low end steakhouse, and way below average for a high end steakhouse.  We were tempted to send quite a few items back.   Dinner Rolls/Bread:  These were good, nice flavor, fluffy.  We each had one piece and were very tempted to have more, but wanted to pace ourselves for what we thought was coming. Beef Tartar -- We've never had beef tartar before so I have nothing to compare this to, this was pretty good.   Spinach Salad -- This was good, the dressing was light with a great peppery flavor to it.   Mozzarella salad - This was also tasty.  We probably should have ended our meal here.  Kobe waygu Ribeye - Blah.  We've had much better -- more tender and flavorful -  ribeyes from Flemings, Mortons, Ruth's Chris, 333 Pacifc, and a handful of other steakhouses.   Kobe waygu Skirt Steak - The middle pieces of this had a pretty nice flavor, but it was a tough piece of meat.  We shouldn't have let the waiter talk us into the skirt steak, but based on how the ribeye tasted I can't imagine the filet could have saved this meal.    Yukon Gold Puree -- Good flavor, very smooth mashed potatoes.  Asparagus - It tasted like asparagus and was nicely grilled. Carrots -- These had a lot of flavor.  Chocolate dessert -- I'm not sure if this was the souffle or the ganache cake -- it seemed to be similar to a lava cake, all I know is it was the worst dessert I've ever had.  And I love everything chocolate. The texture was horrible -- gritty, almost as if someone forgot to fully stir the batter.  Yuck. Grilled pineapple -- This had a nice flavor, but it was probably a can of pineapple with some extra flavoring mixed in. Sorbets -- I'm not a sorbet fan, my husband thought one of the sorbets was pretty good though. Monkey Bread -- This was fantastic.  Definitely the highlight of the meal, but definitely did not make up for the lack of flavor in the steaks.    I will say that the wait staff was great and if we would have complained they probably would have handled it promptly and brought something else out...but when neither of the steaks come close to expectations, I'm not sure complaining would do any good.   I would not go back.  I wanted to give this 1.5 stars, but can't figure out how to do a 1/2 star, I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up to 2 stars instead of down to 1 star.",

The wine suggestion he gave turned out to suit us just right.  I had the braised short ribs which was delish! So tender and full of flavor.  Some friends shared the 32oz Porterhouse while others had the rib eye and T-bone.  Had a little sample of each and all were cooked well.  We also shared some sides, the corn was yummy and mushroom assortment too.  The sugar peas I could pass on.  But overall, a great meal! I hear the one in LA is not as good as the Vegas one.

    "text": "Five stars for the food, zero stars for the atmosphere.    My girlfriend and I had reservatiions for a Friday at 8:30.  We generally go to Delmonico's when we choose a high end steak type place, but we wanted to try something different.  The negative part first, the atmosphere.. We were unlucky enough to be seated at a tiny table with a long communal bench on one side, like one might be seated at the Cheesecake Factory, whose atmosphere is probably a bit nicer than Craftseak.  I sat on the bench side and my girlfriend in the chair opposite me.   The bench jolted and rocked any time one of us on it leaned back or was seated.  Diners on either side of us were about a foot away at most.   There was a couple to my left, and a group of four to my right.  Unfortunately the group of four included one \"loud talker\"  An obnoxious one at that.   I could hear every word she (loud talker)  said, while straining to hear a word my girlfriend said over the surprisingly loud music (blues rock, an interesting choice).    Bright lights plus loud music plus diners on either side of us practically rubbing elbows equals just an awful atmosphere.    Now, in fairness, being seated to an extremely loud person was just bad luck.  And if you happen to get a stand alone table, or one of the very nice looking semi-circular booths, as opposed to one of seats along the communal bench, your experience will be much better.  But still, the over all atmosphere with the loud music is just not very inviting.  When we left, we saw some people that had worse seats than we did. They were at a table in the middle of the bar area, and everyone that was leaving like us, or coming in to be seated had to practically brush up against them to get by.  I sure hope they just dropped in to see if there was a table available and didn't have reservations in advance.  It may sound a bit nit-picky to go on and on about the atmosphere, but if you are going to spend $300 to $400 for two, for a simple 3 course steak or seafood dinner, a nice atmosphere should be part of the package.   On to the positive, the food.  The food was outstanding.   My girlfriend had the filet, and I had the surf and turf, with a filet and a half Maine lobster.   Unlike other reviewers here, our steaks were cooked perfectly.  Very rare for the girlfriend, and medium-rare for me.  Both were served exactly right.  The steaks and lobster were both about as good as they get.  The sides we ordered  were perfect as well.  We had tartare for an appetizer and it was simply amazing.   For dessert we had the monkey bread that other reviewers have raved about.  It was good, though nothing that special in my opinion.  So, absolutely no complaints on the food, nor the service for that matter.   You can't really get super attentive service when the only room the server has to stand in is directly behind the person in the chair.  But our waiter did his best under the circumstances, and the overall service was fine.   Also, our waiter was very helpful when we asked for help in selecting a wine, and ended up suggesting a  California Pinot that turnd out to be very good,  and at $96 was one of the least expensive wines on the list.  The simple fact is, there is nothing complicated about steaks and shellfish and classic sides like spinach,potatoes,asparagus, etc.  In the price range of Craftsteak, there are probably over a dozen restaurants in Las Vegas that can provide this fare every bit as delicious as Craftsteak presented, but with a nice atmosphere too.",

    "text": "My newly wedded wife and I were really looking forward to enjoying a great meal at Craftsteak.  We are both fans of Tom Colicho on Top Chef and it was going to be a treat.  However, we were quite a bit disappointed.  The restaurant itself was very nice and had a great ambiance.  I loved the decoration and the way the restaurant was laid out.  It had a very open floor plan but was very quiet.  The tables and chairs were awesome!    We had the fall tasting menu for $75/person which consisted of the hanger steak, the wagyu steak, and the scallops.  The presentation of the dishes were in very nice looking skillets and the steaks and the scallops looked absolutely delicious.  However, when we started tasting it, I have to admit that the best dish was not the wagyu steak but the hanger steak.  The wagyu steak was cold and chewy.  I had expected a \"melt in your mouth\" sensation but didn't get any of that.  All the other dishes were great.  The appetizers were very good and the desserts were very good as well.  However, their signature steak dish really disappointed me.  The main reason I gave the restaurant 3 stars was really the service.  When we were first seated, we got great service.  Our water was never empty and our server was very attentive.  About 1 hour into our dinner, 2 large groups came and sat down in the tables next to ours.  From that point on, I could not get anybody's attention and had to consistently ask for water or service.  That was very disappointing for such a top rated restaurant.  Incidentally, I felt that I got better service at the Burger Bar at Mandalay bay.",

    "text": "Being a Top Chef fan, had to check out Tom Colicchio's empire of restaurants...unfortunately wichCraft closes at night, so I decided to try the steakhouse.  First, let me say the ribeye steak I had was excellent...simply seasoned, well cooked and flavored, and cooked on the bone.  However, I did have some gripes: (1) the beer selection was terrible...not a huge wine fan, and I like a nice hearty beer, preferably something local or unique, but all they had were the standard Bud, Heiny, and Corona set; and (2) bread service and sides were uninspiring (although interesting in appearance, taste of bread was similar to what you would get in any hospital cafeteria).  Plus for the fresh, briny Kumamoto oysters though...overall, a nice steakhouse, but didnt met my lofty expectations",

    "text": "My husband and I saved Craftsteak for our last night in Vegas and I wish we had skipped it altogether. If there is one word to describe the meal it would be BLAND BLAND BLAND. I don't know if the chef was out of town because it was Labor Day week-end or what, but everything was barely warm, and tasteless. We went with the Waygu tasting menu when I asked about a wine pairing they said to pick any \"flight\" of wine that was offered because they would all go with the meal. Having had many tasting and degustation menus at many other restaurants I was very surprised by this, there was always a certain wine for each course not a \"one size fits all\" mindset. We decided to opt out of the wine flights and stick with mixed drinks.  Our first course was Lobster Bisque which was thin and barely room temperture and as we started to eat that, out came the salads, Caesar, Heirloom Tomatoe, and Buffalo Mozzarella again all I can say is BLAND BLAND BLAND no taste or seasoning what-so-ever. Now I was begining to get really worried about our main course and I was right to worry. The steaks, while cooked fine were as tasteless as everything else, and keep in mind that all of this was served to us with-in 30 minutes of seating down. When you go out for a meal like this is \"supposed\" to be, I don't expect to be rushed in and out the door. There were plenty of empty tables so it's not like they were busy. Anyway, I was so dissapointed in everything that after one bite of the steak my husband and I both decided to send it back. To the restaurants credit they did take it back and offer to make us something else but we just asked for our check and left. They did not charge us for the meal, just the drinks we had. Next time we are in Vegas we will avoid this place at all cost. After reading the reviews for Picasso at the Bellagio I think we'll try there. They seem to know what a degustation menu, wine pairings, and a leisurely dinner pace should be.",

The food was good, but when you consider the price for the food you're getting it definitely wasn't worth it.  And considering the dent in our wallet, we both felt it was definitely lacking.  We both did the dinner menu based around the type of meat you choose.  We had the kobe, which may have been better if we weren't so incredibly stuffed from the appetizers.  Highlights were the kobe beef tartare, the frisee salad and the cucumber salad.  Don't bother with the prawns, they weren't very tasty.  The kobe was good, but once again I don't think we cared much considering how full we were.  The sides with the meat were meh - pomme puree (crappy next to Joel Robouchon), wild mushrooms and grilled brussel sprouts.  Honestly, i can't even recall what we ate for dessert so it couldn't have been that spectacular.  Do yourself a favor, save your money and eat elsewhere.",

    "text": "Well, like others have said, this was a VERY disappointing experience.  I love Tom and have been trying to go here every time we visit vegas but it is always booked up. So, I finally just took a 9:00 reservation figuring after a full day of walking a convention we would have some time to relax and then go enjoy our dinner all the more.  First problem - they lost our reservation and actually told me that if you make it online through MGMs website that it often fails.  Great - good to know.  Luckily I had checked as we were walking by earlier in the day and they went ahead and put us back on the list for 9.  Next problem - table wasnt ready.  Others have said this also.  Really.. how hard is it to have the tables ready?  Plenty of other restaurants of lower quality can do it with ease.  So we waited another 20ish minutes at the bar -starving!  Service was awful.  Others have said this as well.  Our waitress had a couple of large tables and it was obvious that we were not worth her time.  Im paying a lot of money and I had to pour my own overpriced wine.  Our server and her \"helper\" which did not help us at all so Im not sure who exactly she was helping - had a 10 minute conversation about something very in depth while we were wating for our food - which took forever! We didnt even start eating until 10 - ridiculous.  Food: Lobster Bisque was excellent - had a good amount of lobster in it and was creamy and yummy.  Wish we had stuck to just that but...  My husband got the New York Steak for $44 and I had the Sirloin for $56.  Not worth it - not even one little bit.  I can buy and make these steaks for half of that and I would cook them correctly.   We both ordered Medium and my husbands was Medium well and mine was Medium Rare.  We had waited too long for our food as it was and our waitress was nowhere to be seen so we didnt send them back. They werent awful but they were so basic - nothing like I expected.  I figured it was going to be the best steak Ive had - thats what I was hoping and what my experience at Charlie Palmer was like.  But the worst part was our side - Kale with smoked bacon.  They told us they didnt have any left and then all of a sudden there was one order left.  We are assuming it was left at the bottom of the smoker and they \"found\" it for us.  It was the worst thing I have had in a long time.  Nothing but smoked flavor and the kale was like kale jerkey.  If Tom had been there I would have asked him what he was thinking, but no one was there, because like I said - service was awful.  Oh... and the wine list - soooo overpriced.  I mean you expect that somewhat and thats fine, but when the average price of wine on the menu is $150 and you know you have had that wine for about $40 elsewhere - thats just ripping you off because they can.  We felt like suckers after our dinner here.  Lured in by the name and nothing to show for it.  Oh - I guess the portions are large and you have leftovers - great - because most people are there on vacation, without a way to eat leftovers.  Suckers.",

The filet was good and flavorful, the prawns were a nice size and very good. The GF had the bone-in ribeye and she liked it a lot. Our sides were asparagus, which was alright. After all, how good can asparagus be...Also we had Yukon gold puree, this was very good.   The GF liked the decor. But I thought it was just plain brown. Overall, good food and service.

    "text": "Amazing food, service (we hope you listened to us Blue and you are checking this out!), and drinks. Our party of four arrived for our 9:00 reservation and went to the bar until we were seated. If you like a lemon drop try the lemonhead martini (and the servings are plenty on the 'tini's!) We did the Kobe Beef Surf and Turf tasting menu (the $155 option and since we had the prima card it lowered the price to $130 a person, LOVE that card!) - and we are all still full from last night. The portions and amount of food was pretty amazing. And I am the picky eater in the group and they were more than accommodating, they couldn't have made it any easier!  To start we really wanted to try the lobster bisque which isn't included with the tasting menu but we switched one of our main courses so they gave us each a small cup of the bisque to try and it is GOOD! Chunks of lobster in a yummy broth. For our first course we had hawaiian prawns (served with head on and grilled with cocktail sauce),heirloom tomato salad (olive oil and I think he said with champagne vinegar, fresh basil and salt and pepper), roasted red peppers (surprisingly good, served with garlic) & the Kobe beef Tartare (served with bread and a quail egg on top) And yes, that is just ONE course! The prawns were delicious and I love heirloom tomatoes and the salad was yummy and refreshing!   For the main course we asked to try the braised short ribs (we traded these with the skirt steak) - there are not enough words to tell you how absolutely amazing, succulent, decadent, flavorful, (seriously) these short ribs are - you HAVE to try these if you go. Our Kobe beef entrees were the flat iron steak and the filet. Our other entree was the Braised Maine Lobster. Served in the shell our waiter took the time to take it out of the shell for us to make it easier. The lobster is served in a broth much like the bisque so we were really happy campers! There was so much lobster, we couldn't believe the portion size on this! They definitely don't skimp here! For our sides we had the asparagus, an assortment of mushrooms, the potato puree, and the sweet corn (the sweet corn was a table favorite - delicious!)  And now desert....it was amazing to see all the options that they served us for our final course. Four different types of sorbet (pineapple, strawberry, peach and chocolate), monkey bread with banana ice cream, a rhubarb crisp with tangerine ice cream, vanilla bean cheesecake, peach pavlova, and two small plates of fresh fruit (and I might be forgetting one other desert). The monkey bread was my favorite as well as the strawberry and pineapple sorbets.  I would also like to mention that the service here at Craftsteak truly is topnotch. Blue, our waiter, was very knowledgeable and has some excellent suggestions. All of the staff assigned to our table was fantastic and the decor is very cool.",

    "text": "This place oozes so much class I thought they would call me \"Sir\".  And then ask me to leave.  Most restaurants in Vegas have the diners in full view of people passing by; not this joint.  You get ushered into a huge dimly lit back area with multiple stations, large booths and casual areas as well.  They had a person going around and taking pictures of diners to create memory books.  I didn't know what to make of it.  I saw one woman convince her reluctant husband to buy it.  I wanted to take the picture and see how much it would cost for us to cherish the memories in official form, but my better half shooed away the phtographer.  I was slightly but noticeably disappointed.  We had the American Kobe menu, which we knew we would have going in, but asked the waiter to explain it anyways.  I mean the head waiter, not the assistant waiter, bus boy or water boy.  Division of labor here would have any union proud.  The sheer number of people attending to you adds alot to both the experience and the bill; and the experience of getting the bill here is unforgettable.    The kobe tartare was strange but grew on me.  Raw beef on crackers?  I guess eating spoonfuls of raw beef just wasn't classy enough.  I avoided all the mushrooms but the peppers were fine.  When our entrees and sides came out we weren't quite ready to part with the appetizers , so we had them leave everything on the table.  That was a sight, since I think every inch of our table was covered by a plate with food in it.  The meat was served in small skillets and diced up for you, which was odd but makes sense in the context we were sharing.  It was an American Kobe rib eye and skirt steak, medium rare.  Oddly enough the skirt steak was much more flavorful.  I suspect they used more seasoning since its a tougher cut, and the ribeye should be able to stand on its own.  Both steaks were cooked well and tender and sitting in its own juices. I'm going to have to go after Official Japanese Wagyu Kobe beef from the Hyogo prefecture some day, because I would not say there's a huge difference in quality from moving from Prime to American Kobe.  That last frontier has my credit card shaking though.   I don't think we ate much more than half of anything brought to us before we were stuffed.  They brought us so much food and there was so much left on our table it was mildly embarassing.  The desserts were great, but once again we were done in by too much food.  Unfortunately, I was a bit underwhelmed by the steak though.  The steak we took home in a doggy bag got fed to my wife's dog.  And I wasn't that disappointed to miss out on it.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking to eat something before we saw Ka, so we walked over to craftsteak and decided to try it out. He had had it once before, and I hadn't eaten here before but he got me excited for it. Unfortunately our whole situation was handled so poorly that I had to comment on it.  First off, it took close to 20 minutes after we sat down to order, which we weren't too worried about because we still had over an hour to eat and walk two minutes away to catch Ka. I ordered a lobster bisque, asparagus and the short rib, he ordered the Wagyu skirt steak (as suggested by our waitress).  The bisque came out almost immediately and was INCREDIBLE. so good. Scarfed it down and then waited for our entrees. And waited and waited and waited.  Close to 45 minutes after the bisque our waitress came back over and told us the food would be out shortly because she knew we had a show to catch, and then walked away- we weren't exactly sure what was going on but she was kind of rushing so we could tell something was up.  About an hour after we ordered (when we said we had to leave by) the food shows up. And by this time we knew that we only would have enough time to shovel it into our mouths and run. The food was so wonderful, I was honestly heartbroken to have to leave over half of it on the table so we wouldn't have to miss the show we just paid for. Our waitress came with the food to explain what had happened, I guess there was a glitch in the kitchen and they weren't able to cook for a while, which I totally understand-things happen, not a problem. Then right before we had to leave, the manager came over with two new drinks to take with us to the show as kind of a apology, which we did appreciate. We were just so frustrated that no one came over really to explain anything beforehand, and that we ended up paying over $200 for a meal which we only barely got to enjoy. It was a nice gesture to bring us two fresh drinks on the house, but I didn't go there for the drinks, I went for the food, and I didn't get to eat what I wanted. Had we known that all the grills were shut down, we would have paid for the soup and our drinks and left. Instead we were stuck paying for two beautiful cuts of meat that we just got the bare minimum of before we sprinted out the door.   Really, really bummed.",

We had diver scallops, arugula & pecorino salad, proscuitto San Daniele, grilled Pacific prawns, shortribs, the flat iron steak, roasted free range chicken, pureed potatoes, asparagus, shitake mushrooms and carrots. Everything was delicious and a month later we are still getting thanks for such a wonderful dinner. Next time we are in Vegas we will be sure to visit again. The only complaint I have is that while the rest of the restaurant's decor is nice, the private rooms are a bit bland.",

But worth every penny & I savored it with a fine Malbec of theirs. I would visit again...Hats off to the Chefs ;)  On another note, their staff was not only super cordial but extremely attentive and knowledgeable of the dishes... they have a great training program.",

    "text": "Ok, so after loyally following Top Chef for years now, I have always been wanting to try out Craftsteak for some time.  And happy that I did.    My husband and I arrived to Vegas Saturday late afternoon and had not made any reservation.  We checked out MGM's restaurant row and stopped by to see if Craftsteak can accommodate us.  The greeter said we can get seated at the bar right away so we gladly accepted.  The restaurant is dark and was buzzing with happy eaters.  Neither of us were that hungry, so we started out with frisee salad, shared 12 oz Wagyu skirt steak, sauteed spinach and french fries seasone with paprika.    Before we were served our food, 6 fluffy,  just out of the oven bread rolls came out to us...and they were HEAVENLY!!!!  It may have been one of the best bread I had in restaurants.    I really liked frisee salad, compared to Comme Ca's because it had more dressing and less bacon to balance out the salad.  The Wagyu skirt steak came out already sliced and were DELICIOUS.  The only complaint I have is that they got cold fairly quickly.  Spinach was well seasoned and balanced our steak well, and fries, what can I say...were sooo tasty.  My husband usually needs cups of ketchup with his fries, but these fries were seasoned so well, he ate them just by itself!  I will definitely come back here!  Go Tom Colicchio!!!",

STOP filling up on bread Doug...yes, you can have these too...bread was good.  As a group of 6, we opted for their special taster.  4 of us even got the wine taste which included a red, a white, and a dessert.  the dessert wine was from italy, very sweet...very delicious.  They are able to provide alternatives, like huge scallops, for non-red meat eaters.  Sorry Win, might not be the best place for you,  but I want my steak.  Caren, we were there for the same weekend...our scallops were awesome, steaks were good but not the best I've had.  I didn't touch the quail, i used to have some as pets.  Don't ask...  It was fun tryin the 5 types of steaks, judging them, then eating more.  The potato puree was well whipped creamy mashed potatoes....mmmmmm  There was this bread pudding....very nice.  i normally do not eat bread pudding, but I had to try this one.  The pear ice cream, sorbet...very interesting in a good way.  Bring friends here for a nice dinner in Vegas.  It is an experience to at least try it for once.  located in the back of the MGM, bathrooms are outside.  i love the hanging lights.",

I enjoyed the roasted red peppers, and the prawns (flown in fresh from Hawaii) in a light citrus butter sauce were phenomenal. My friend fondly reminsces about this place. Read: these prawns would play a prominent role in her last meal on earth. Now, the steak! It was very well marinated and moist. For dessert, the sorbet was a great light way to end our meal.  I highly recommend this establishment.",

    "text": "Boyfriend & I had dinner here on a Friday night.. We started with Chilled Shrimp Cocktail and baby artichoke salad. For the main course he ordered the 10 oz. Filet Mignon /Diver Sea Scallops and sauteed spinach , and I had the halfsteak 6 oz. Angus skirt steak (which came w/ two \"half\" sides), Baby Shiitake Mushrooms, corn, and can't forget the wine... a nice bottle of Susan Balbo malbec.   First off, we would have never chose this place if it weren't for the $100 credit... with that being said I'll start this lovely review!  Craftsteak is a pretty trendy looking place, nice big bar and lounge area to hang out in. Servers are very nice, only complaint is that we had to refill our wine once ourselves, no biggie. The bread is SO GOOD. It's freshly baked w/ sea salt on top, it doesn't dissapoint! Shrimp cocktail was good, artichoke salad was great. I've never had anything like it and was very satisfied. Boyfriend's filet was ok, scallops were better, spinach was nothing special. My halfsteak was more like a full steak! Corn was delicious, mushrooms were not. For dessert we had the crunchy rice pudding (think rice pudding in fried pastry) w/ pineapples on the side. YUMMY. At this point our bellies were very full. Bill came out to around $250 w/ tip.   Would we come back? Probably if we were ever in MGM again (highly unlikely.. I hate MGM =/). Craftsteak is good but not great.   ENJOY!",

After reading some of the other reviews, I chose the surf and turf with scallops as the turf option.  IMHO, the scallops were overdone and rubbery.  The steak was a nice texture and done correctly, but didn't even have the fundamentals of seasoning even vaguely noticeable.  It was utterly tasteless.  So, my apologies to all of you that have had good experiences here....it just didn't live up to the reviews or my expectations.",

So I did some research and then decided on Craftsteak based on many reviews I had read. Our group of four decided to do the Chefs Seasonal Tasting Menu.  First Course: Diver Sea Scallops with Shaved Fennel (5 stars) Roasted Heirloom Beet Salad and  Pickled Egg (4 stars) Italian Buffalo Mozzarella (4.5/5 stars) Main Course: Roasted Prime Filet Mignon (4.5/5 stars) Grilled Prime Angus Flat Iron (5 stars) Sides: Braised Brussels Sprouts with Smoked Bacon (3.5/4 stars) Mushroom Assortment (5 stars) Ricotta Ravioli (5 stars) Desserts: Vanilla Bean Cheesecake (4.5 stars) Chocolate Souffle (5 stars) Warm Apple Fritters (5 stars) Cinnamon Monkey Bread (4.5/5 stars) Chocolate Ganache Cake (5 stars)  I could not have asked for a better meal, it was absolutely divine. There was very minimal talking during the meal, you could have heard a pin drop on our table. We were all floored with the flavor of every element of our meal.   The wait staff was extremely kind and helpful whenever we had questions. They never rushed our meal along in between courses but had perfect timing and never had us waiting for the next course.   Craftsteak is pricey but please believe it is totally worth it!",

However, my dad and I were recommended the chef's menu, which turned out to be a great deal and a whole lot of food. For $130 per person, the two of us shared: grilled prawns, 3 salads, 3 side starches, 2 wagyu steaks, and 3 desserts. I'm not usually a huge salad fan, but the frisee salad with bacon and poached egg, and the arugula with pine nuts were fantastic! The wagyu filet and ribeye were to die for. The best, most buttery steak I've ever had. They had a wonderful sear on the outside too. The mushroom risotto and sweet corn are a must get.  Just when we thought we were done, completely stuffed with delicious food, out comes three desserts - the famous monkey bread, peach pavlova, and fruit sorbets. They were all amazing in their own way and worked great together. The price was steep, but this would be the place to spend your money. It was all worth it. An amazing dining experience.  Service equally matched the fantastic food. Our waiter was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. He recommended dishes to us and was right every time. The wine and beverage pourers were also super friendly. It felt like like we were in a local dining establishment, where everyone knew us. This was a fine dining steakhouse, but it was comfortable, not snooty. Overall, one of the best food experiences ever (Chez Panisse is still up there). Highly recommended.",

Everything is a la carte but they do have some meal options.   I had the flat iron steak and my husband had the rib eye. We ordered 3 veggie sides since we don't eat grains: baby carrots, green beans and the sweet corn.   Steaks:  The flat iron was perfectly cooked and tender. It was well seasoned and delicious.   The rib eye: my husband enjoyed it but it seemed a little fatty to me.   Sides: everyone says this place is known for their side dishes. Not really sure what all the fuss was about!  Carrots: baby orange and yellow. They were in a sweet honey sauce that was just ok. They could have been seasoned better and they weren't cooked evenly. Some were hard and some soft.   Green beans:  these were pretty boring. They were in a butter sauce with almonds. Something I could make at home.   Sweet corn: this was pretty good.The corn was nice and sweet and the seasoning was good too. I liked the corn with the green onions.   We peeked at a dessert menu but it didn't have anything too exciting on it. A lot of fruit dishes and nothing cake-like. I would have preferred a chocolate cake or tiramisu. We skipped dessert altogether.   Overall I was not too impressed. The prices are super high and not worth it as far as I am concerned.   I was more impressed with the steak house at Circus Circus! Better food and better prices!!",

My wife and I order the Chef's Beef Selection of Domestic Wagyu. It included your choice of appetizer, 2 soups & salads, 3 side dishes and 2 steaks. The shrimp cocktail we had was very tasty shrimp. The lobster bisques was very silky with nice pieces of Maine lobster, very flavorful. They had a seasonal Heirloom tomato salad that my wife loved (I'm not a fan of tomatoes ), and I had the roast red pepper salad which was nicely dressed with good seasoning. For the side we had season squash, a roasted corn special and risotto. Unfortunately the risotto was awful. It was a congealed mess. When we told the waiter he was very apologetic and we subbed out and got the potato gratin. All of the side dishes were nicely done (with the aforementioned risotto) the roast corn was especially good and had some cilantro and bacon. Now the stars, we had the ribeye and filet mignon. They were some of the best steaks we ever had. The filet was the BEST I've ever had and was fork tender! Both were perfectly cook and bursting with great flavor. For desert they bought out a cheesecake with chocolate and walnuts a nicely done dish. Also had fresh seasonal fruit and a scoop of lime and strawberry sobert. I highly recommend Craftsteak, the best steaks and overall just a great dining experience!",

After watching many episodes of Top Chef and hearing Chef Tom C. chastise contestants regarding quality, execution and 'if it's not right, don't serve it', I was anxiously anticipating a truly fine dining experience of extraordinary quality.  Well Tommy, you failed.  Epic fail.  It was one of the worst meals I've had in an upscale fine dining establishment.  The meat was a poor cut, the service slower than snot, the meal cold and the sides greasy.  Presentation was thoroughly poor.  The wait staff bumbled over each other trying to figure out who got what.  I now refer to CraftSteak as 'CrapSteak'. When I now see Tom shooting his mouth off on TC, I laugh my ass off over the hypocracy. Tom, please pack your knives and go home.",

    "text": "First I'll start with the reservation wait time since this was what the 1 star deduction was for. I made a reservation for a party of two at 7:30 PM on a Tuesday night during the off-season. When I arrived I was told I would be seated shortly and that tables were just being cleared off. Instead, we waited for 30 minutes and were forgotten about. It was only after I went to speak with a different hostess that they seemed to have remember we were waiting and then we were seated within 10 minutes. So approximately a 40 wait past the reservation, which I find to be unacceptable for such an established restaurant.   As for the food, the quality was second to none. I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the domestic Wagu strip steak. He thought it was the best steak he has ever had and is a big steak fan, and I thought for a steak house especially, that the salmon was great. Both dishes were cooked perfectly to order. The sides were AWESOME. We got the potato puree, vegetables, potatoes, and a few other things. Portions are HUGE and easily share-able. Also the bottle of red wine which was approximately $90 was very good and complimented the meal well. The server was very friendly, attentive, and knew a lot about the menu and suggestions/parings.   Overall great experience and great food.",

We started out with a bump...we had reservationsf or two for months, and when we were seated we were put at a bar table. As the place filled up and we made our dinner order it got really annoying there. We had to flag down a manager and ask why we weren't given a dining room table. She moved us, apologized and was great about it. Even with this, I was blown away by my dinner.  We did the chef's wagyu menu and started out with cucumber and watcress salad, a salad with bacon, blue cheese and frisee, the pacific prawns and the beef tartare. I knew as soon as I tried these four apps served family style I was in love! The entree was a filet and a ribeye steak, and rocked my world. I never truly believed that paying that much for a choice cut of steak was worth it until then. A little mushrooms sampler bowl, mashed taters and asparagus were served. That all sounds really basic, but everything they touched tasted like heaven.  We were stuffed already, but couldn't resist all the dessert choices: cinnamon monkey bread was out of the world (and i don't really love cinnamon desserts), a chocolate ganache cake, some sorbets.  Our wine choice was great, and our server helped steer us toward a better, and only teeny bit pricier bottle.  Yes, the bill was 450 after tip, and that is crazy, but this food is crazy good!",

    "text": "When everything elicits a mouthgasm, you know it's good. Meal of a lifetime. There were more than a few moans coming from our table, at one point my friend put her fist on the table after her first bite of something delectable, and I believe I may have threatened to fight my companions for the monkey bread. But back to the beginning.   We decided to get the Domestic Waygu Chef's tasting. The appetizers included bread with sea salt, a warm frisse bacon blue cheese salad, prawns, prosciutto, and another salad with a raspberry vinagrette. Normally when someone says the bread  was a standout, that implies everything else wasn't too good. But in this case, the bread was Just. That. Good. Didn't even need butter, in my opinion.  Next was the meat. Filet, new york strip, and ribeye. The new york strip was my favorite--every piece was like butter. Sides were risotto, potato puree, and honey glazed carrots with rosemary. They were all good, but the meat was amazing, and the reason we came in the first place, so we beasted our way through the meat and left a bit of the sides behind.   At this point, we were all a bit weary with the meal. We asked our server for a bit more time to digest before dessert. Throughout the entire meal, the service was stellar--we started off with them offering to switch our white napkins to black ones, so my friend's black outfit wouldn't get all lint-y. They continued being attentive throughout the meal.   After a bit more time to attempt to digest, dessert arrived. The infamous monkey bread with ice cream (do not remember what flavor), chocolate souffle with hazlenut ice cream (YUM), a fresh fruit plate that went largely untouched, vanilla bean cheesecake with cream, and a trio of sorbets (orange-basil, a raspberry with something else, and another flavor I do not remember, but it was creamy). As another reviewer said, it was the best cheesecake of my life. However, even with that, the sorbet and monkey bread were so over the top with amazingness that it went largely untouched. There is no way to describe the monkey bread, only it may have been the best dessert of this sweet tooth's life. The raspberry sorbet was so tart it almost tasted fizzy, which I loved. I wasn't the biggest fan of the orange-basil as a dessert, but it would be refreshing as hell poolside.   All in all, worth every penny--even though it was a good quarter of a paycheck. Cannot wait to return for more.",

We started with the shrimp cocktail for the table and several salads we enjoyed the Baby bibb buttermilk blue cheese with bacon. (reminded me of a wedge) and we loved the Italian buffalo mozzarella, wild arugula and roasted baby beets. Our meals had 24 hour short rib, rib eye, NY strip, flat iron , hangar and filet mignon. These were accompanied by asparagus, sweet corn, Japanese eggplant, mushroom assortment, potato puree, risotto (snap peas, prosciutto, scallions) and white corn grits. Just when you thought you were on food overload they brought out all the desert. cinnamon monkey bread, soft chooclate cake creme brulee tart and assorted sorbets.. The deserts were not as good as the meals. If you go as a group I would recommend the chef tasting vs a la carte we had plenty of food and were able to taste alot of different meals. Staff was attentive and had good suggestions.",

    "text": "With the positive reviews, I had pretty high expectations.  I cannot explain how disappointed I was. I ordered the bone-in ribeye for $50. When it first came out it looked good and it was very tender. I started eating it, and there was a huge amount of fat in my first few bites. I figured that is okay, it is probably only on the outside and once I got deeper into the steak it would improve. Unfortunately, the steak was about 75% fat. And not marbelized fat that you would expect, but unchewable large fat portions. I had to spit out almost every single bite of the steak. The worst part is that the bartender basically said this is normal with a ribeye and said I should have ordered a different steak. That completely insulted me because he is flat wrong and he acted like I don't know about steaks. I always order a ribeye steak; it is my favorite. I have eaten fantastic ribeyes at Ruth's Chris, Del Friscos, and Smith and Wollensky. I had a great ribeye at the steakhouse at circus circus. I routinely buy ribeye steaks from Costco and Sams and grill them myself, and never have I eaten a steak this bad. A ribeye does have more fat than other steaks, but it is not supposed to be primarily unchewable fat. The bartender did not acknowledge that I got a really bad cut of meat, and he refused to comp the steak (he comped my one glass of wine--woohoo). He said I ate most of the steak. I didn't eat it--I chewed much of the steak and spit out most of it. I guess I should have sent it back immediately, but I kept thinking the steak would improve as I got deeper but it never did. This is an embarrassment that an expensive Las Vegas steakhouse would serve this cut of meat. I would normally never give a 1 star review, but the quality of this steak was so bad and their refusal to acknowledge this makes me very angry. If you do go to Craftsteak, do not order the ribeye.",

    "text": "Having heard very good things about their restaurant in Century City (Los Angeles), I was expecting nothing but the best from Craftsteak Las Vegas. Firstly, I must admit the quality of the food is quite good. I started off with the heirloom tomato salad which was served with very high quality tomatos topped with light drizzle of olive oil and some fresh cracked pepper.  Light, fresh.. very delicious. My buddies ordered Tuna Tartar, Arugula Salad, Persian Cucumbers (my friend who ordered this happened to be Persian so we had a few good jokes about this) and chantrelles. All of these were excellent and large enough to share. We also ordered a couple bottles of wine and Craftsteak has a wide selection of very good wines (california cabs all the way to rare bordeaux) at decent prices. For main courses, we ordered some Rib eye, New York Strip, Kobe Rib Eye & Salmon.  We also ordered sides of Risotto (the best), Yukon Gold Puree, French Beans, Hen of the woods mushrooms and creamed spinach. The quality of the beef/fish was good, but was not prepared correctly. For example, my friend ordered his beef  \"Rare\" and it came out more on the end of  \"medium.\" Service was also VERY slow and the wait staff was not knowledgeable about the menu nor the wine list. For a dinner we expected to take 1.5-2 hrs tops turned out to be a 3 hour ordeal. Although the food was good, service leaves something to be desired at this restaurant. There are plenty of good restaurants in Las Vegas and I think it would be awhile before we come back here.",

Yeah. *Wink*  As a group of four, we split the Italian Buffalo Mozzarella, Baby Spinach, Brussels Sprouts and Maui Onions. I decided that if I was going to try Hand-Cut Wagyu Beef Tartare, it was going to be at Craftsteak. The table was silent and I felt like Alice drinking from the bottle. It was...different. Almost like, err, cold taut pasta.   The warm bread is worth it. Trust me. And now for the steak. I'm not much of a meat eater, but once again, \"When in Rome\".... I went for the Prime Filet Mignon. I took a bite and closed my eyes.  My mini vision quest...  Me (In my purple Bestey Johnson number, heels and all, floating in the sky): Why, hello, cow. You're in heaven, I see.   Cow (flying in the sky, complete with golden halo and wings): So (rubbing its hooves together): What do you think? Juicy enough. Not to gamey?  Me: Oh, Cow. (Hugging cow). You were wonderful. Thank you for providing me with protein from your body and unwillingly sacrificing your life for this meal. Bless you.  Cow: (Blushing) Why, thank you!  See you in hell, traitor! (Drop kicks me back to Earth)  ***POOF!!!!!***  Whoa. Yeah, it was guilty good. So good, my husband ate the leftovers before I got to them. Sigh. It was a fantastic meal.

Everything is done well but not over the top, which may be their intent.  Food wise they do offer a great selection of beef from domestic, domestic kobe, or the way out of my price range imported A5 wagyu.  They seem to always push the domestic kobe skirt steak, which is actually really good.  Don't bother with the scallops as someone else mentioned.  They are small and way overcooked.  You are at a steak house.. stick with the steak.  Sides are really good.  They offer roasted sunchoke which is something I've never tasted previously, but I do miss the pan roasted sweet corn.  Warm frisee salad is always a winner to start with.    Ambiance is nice, kinda dark inside unlike Carne Vino or Joe's.  Oh they do have the BEST rolls.  I could eat about 50 of these.  4 Stars!",

They start you off with hot-out-of-the-oven parker house rolls, topped with butter and sea salt. These were excellent. The organic lettuce salad with lemon vinaigrette was wonderful. So fresh and very refreshing. Just perfect. Hubby had the Angus bone-in NY Strip. It was actually tough and didn't taste or have the mouthfeel of prime meat at all. I had the Angus bone-in Ribeye. It was tasty, but also did not seem to be prime. It also was unevenly cut so that the thinner parts were overcooked. (I found this ironic based on how often Tom has judged people on poorly butchered meat!) The steaks arrive in a copper skillet swimming in demi glace. It's a nice way to serve, but you have to like thyme because the herb permeates the steak and the cippolini onion that is served with it. Our sides were french fries (excellent...homemade and crispy), and brussels sprouts with bacon. About half the sprouts were well-done, and caramelized, making them delicious. The other half looked and tasted as though they were steamed, so there is a bit of inconsistency there as well. We finished up with something called Chocolate Decadence which was not very good at all. It looked and tasted like something you'd find in your high-end grocery store bakery case. But the consistency was \"gloppy\" and also had chocolate nibs throughout, making a terrible \"too crunchy\" texture in random areas that didn't seem intentional. It was like chewing bebes. The desert didn't fit with the \"feel\" of the restaurant and certainly was not worth $15. We will not go back to Craftsteak.",

Absolutely incredible. The steak was cooked in a castiron dish which created it's own sauce with rosemary and other herbs. I should have licked the plate clean it was that amazing.

The food was just alright. Yes, the bread is very good and so was the potato puree...but everything else was just average. I wanted to love it and for the price I really wanted to love the food. I will say that the service was amazing. The steak was average, we've had better. If you're looking for a romantic restaurant to impress your date this is the place, if you want really good food I'd go somewhere else.",

I was seated at a great table in the lounge area where I can check out all the babes walking in and watch ESPN at the same time.  The ambience in this place just screams sexy.........as I sat in my comfy sofa seat.  I ordered the lobster bisque, rib-eye steak and sides of spinach and fries.  The bisque and super tasty warm buttery roll melted in my mouth. After eating the bisque and rolls, I could of left fully satisfied.....  The rib-eye steak was fuckingoutstanding...............perfect...... without the need for any seasoning..........  The sides were good, but the steak, bisque and rolls will keep me coming back.........!!!!  The host and mgr came by to ask me about my meal.......I was so hot.........after eating that I could of f.......ed them both.  It was that good!",

Unlike the other participating restaurants that gave you a list of choices to pick for your 3 course meal.  Craftsteak prefix gave you all items on the list.  4 starters, 2 steaks plus 3 sides, scallops, and dessert.  Every dish more delicious than the last.  The steaks were cooked to perfection. Definitely worth going back for more.  Next time: wagyu beef.",

    "text": "One of the best meals of my life. Located in the MGM Grand, this is an incredible place but certainly not cheap. If you think paying $50 for a piece of meat is insane, this is not the place for you. First they bring out some bread that was made in heaven. When just the bread made me weep tears of joy, I knew I was in for a great culinary experience. For starters I got a persian cucumber salad and my friend got the lobster bisque. Fresh. Incredible. Then we both got the filet mignon, cooked exactly as ordered and melted in my mouth. Also got deep friend zucchini blossoms which were like no zucchini I've ever had before. Music in my mouth. Lastly I chose pink lemon sorbet for dessert and it was tart and refreshing perfection.  They have a HUGE wine selection here and I had a sonoma syrah while my friend had a couple of apple martinis.  Our service was impeccable.  I really don't have the superlatives to describe what an all-around perfect experience I had here. I am a bit frugal but here I had no qualms about spending every penny I paid. As an aside, there was an actual made-for-tv moment when someone tried to swallow too much meat and the heimlich had to be performed. The staff handled this quickly and effectively without much drama. Kudos to them for saving this man and doing so in a manner that was surprisingly of minimal disturbance to the customers dining there.",

I'm a lobster bisque aficionado, and almost always order it if I can find it on the menu when eating out.  The bisque here is serious business.  As satisfying as any I've had.  Nice amount of lobster, large bowl, creamy, a touch of brandy...  Delicious.  I'd grant them five stars if not for the fact that the layout/design of the restaurant is lacking.  If you're seated near the front, loads of people are constantly walking by as it is close to the restrooms for the casino. Why not build a divide of some sort that is functional and stylish?",

    "text": "Maybe my review is biased because I received 30% off of my bill, but I think I still would have given it 5 stars even without the AWESOME discount!  While in Vegas my boyfriend and I were treated to a freaking VIP experience. They seated us in this amazing booth and the manager and chef came out to welcome and greet us. The chef had prepared a tasting menu for us, and we really felt like royalty. It was pretty crazy. I've literally never had so many people waiting on me (and this is a steakhouse... not The French Laundry or anything).   Our tasting menu consisted of the biggest damn \"tastes\" ever. One of our waiters even told us we were being served the half-portion. I can't even imagine what a whole portion looked like!!   Okay... so here's what our tasting menu included:  Appetizers: 1. Baby beets and pickled egg (I don't like beets OR pickled egg, but yes... this was pretty good) 2. Italian Buffalo Mozzarella (Hello Heaven) 3. Vermont Quail with kumquats (I could have left happy with only this) 4. Arugula & shaved pecorino (sort of forgettable, but tasty)  Main Course: 1. Filet Mignon (Melt in your mouth insanity) 2. Angus Flatiron (Mmmmmm) 3. Japanese A5 Waygu Beef (Seriously the best piece of meat I have ever consumed in my entire existence on this place that we call earth) 4. Maine Lobster  Sides: 1. Yukon Gold Puree (The softest, most decadent, buttery mashed potatoes you will ever encounter) 2. Italian Kale and Smoked Bacon (Not the most memorable dish of the night, but definitely nice)  Desserts: Now, at this point we were both beyond full. As I said, this tasting menu was nothing like a tasting menu. This meal could have easily fed a whole family. But of course they insisted that we try their dessert selection, and they brought out no less than 6 desserts for 2 people to eat... insanity!!!!!! These insane plates included: 1. Butterscotch Mousse with Brown Sugar Meringue & Pecan Praline Cookies 2. Cinnamon Monkey Bread with Pecan Toffee & Banana Brown Sugar Ice Cream- THIS ONE WAS THE BESTTTTTT 3. Chocolate Ganache Cake with Cocoa Nib Brittle & Sweet Cream 4. Warm Apple Tarte Tatin with Spiced Streusel & Vanilla Bean Ice Cream 5. Chocolate Souffle with Hot Fudge Sauce & Sicilian Pistachio Ice Cream 6. Ice Cream/Sorbet Tasting plate with the following flavors: Vanilla Bean, Milk Chocolate Malt, Sicilian Pistachio, Orange Basil, Cabernet/Syrah Grape, and Grapefruit  Okay... so if you count all of that up, my boyfriend and I were served a grand total of 16 plates, all of which were delicious and different than anything I've ever had at any other steakhouse. Tom Collichio, sir, you have made me a very happy girl with your gargantuan portions and your stellar staff/selection of food.",

I took my husband for his 40 Birthday and had very high expectations. The main issue - the food was cold and unflavored, this was True for the appetizers as well as the steaks. We ask the waiter if the mushrooms are suppose to be so cold, it was replaced with a burned dish. No compensation was offered (which I would expect from a \"chef restaurant\").   Before making reservation to this restaurant, I read many reviews and could not believe the bad ones (apparently it is all True), I thought people just being mean. Visiting Las Vegas from Seattle and choosing this restaurant as the \"Chef restaurant\" for our celebration was a mistake, I would hate to see anyone else wasting their experiences like us.",

    "text": "We went here for Christmas dinner...we were excited to eat here.  We were seated right away and greeted by our waiter in a timely manner.  The waiter was aware that this was our first time dining at this establishment.  Our waiter should have recommended for us to share our starter salads, which were larger than a single serving.  Instead, he just kept asking each of the four of us what we wanted for our starter.  So we were full after the starter because you can't take them home.  When ordering our meat, he STRONGLY declined taking an order for a medium well piece of meat (last I knew WE were the ones paying for the meal and should get what we want).  He eventually said the chef couldn't guarantee the meat past medium rare.  We then took his recommendation for a medium rare flat iron steak, which in turn had to be chewed for five minutes before you could swallow it (they did correct for that and remove from our bill).  The scallops were small (& a bit fishy w/ some sand) and did not melt in your mouth.  The Brussels sprouts were average, but the bread, potato puree, short ribs were good.  The monkey bread was good...but not worth the $15.  MAKE SURE IF YOU TAKE YOUR FOOD HOME, ASK FOR YOUR BONE (which has meat on it that you didn't eat since you were trying to trying to use proper etiquette).  After paying $$ for a piece of meat that they cut off the bone and serve to you..you expect them to put it in your to go box when they pack it up for you. Basically you are paying for his name.",

    "text": "This is the first time I have taken the time to write a review for a restaurant.  It was so impressive that taking the time to offer deserved praise and recommend others enjoy it too was necessary.  The entire experience was top notch.  Obviously the food needs to be great to qualify as a great restaurant. Check.  Everything was amazing.  From the fresh bread, appetizers, entrees to dessert each course was impressive in its own right.  I haven't ever been to a restaurant that got so much right.  The service was stellar.  I worked as a waiter through college at some nice restaurants so I expect good service at expensive restaurants.  Its stunning how many restaurants allow the front of the house experience to be blown by a shitty server.  The service here was fantastic.  Clearly the dining room manager is on their game.  The staff was knowledgeable, helpful and attentive without being intrusive.  Well-trained, well-managed and well-hired.  Great.  Finally, I'm I don't subscribe to architecture or design magazines or anything so its not like I usually care all that much about decor. However some restaurants just have a great look and feel and others just don't.  Example: the night after Craftsteak we went to Bobby Flay's restaurant Mesa Grill because my wife is a fan.  Mesa Grill felt like we were sitting on top of each other (this isn't SF where space is limited, its the desert, everything is huge). Mesa Grill had the ambiance of an upscale Denny's.  wtf.  By contrast, sitting in Craftsteak you felt like you were in an upscale classy, elegant steak house in a resort destination; which you are, so it should look and feel like it.  Very cool, very laid back atmosphere.  Overall I give this restaurant a 10.0.  We eat out a LOT and at some great locations. This was one of the best restaurant experiences ever.",

The service, ambiance and FOOD was amazing.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time in a large corner booth.  Our waiter, Kevin, was charismatic and helpful.  He did a wonderful job explaining our options, describing the food and making perfect recommendation.  On his suggestion, we got the Chef's beef selection, with an Angus prime rib and t-bone, and a wagyu strip steak.  The wagyu was phenomenal.  Honestly, if you can only get one thing - get that.  But, if you get the Chef's menu, you also get these amazing sweet/salty buns to start, then lobster bisque with giant chunks of lobster, then salads (we got the warm frisee salad, the mozzarella salad and the arugula salad), then the steak and three sides (asparagus, snow peas and potato puree).  All of it completely divine.  Finally, they brought us a bazillion desserts, which I was much too full to eat, but my friends said the monkey bread was to die for.  We were attended to regularly, but not rushed in the slightest.    A perfectly decadent Vegas meal.",

    "text": "I went here a couple of weeks ago for a friend's bday. The venue is fairly large so it can definitely accommodate a large party. (We had like 12 people and it was no problem)   What I ate: Lobster bisque, kobe skirt steak, spinach side dish & cinnamon monkey bread. (FYI - I shared all of this with someone and was really full by the end of the meal. I had friends that ordered their own entrees etc and couldn't finish their food.)   Now if you're into bisque, it's a really good soup. Not too heavy on the cream like some other soups can be. I'm not really into cream soups though so I thought it was good but not amazing. One good thing was it did have large chunks of lobster at the bottom. (I guess for an $18 soup, it better!)   The kobe skirt steak was really good. I thought the meat was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. I was really happy with my choice on that one. The spinach as the side dish though was only ok. I didn't think it had that much flavor. I felt like the literally took spinach, boiled it and served with maybe a pinch of salt. Would of been nice if they did something a little extra with it but it served it's purpose (i.e. get my serving of veggies in so I don't feel guilty about eating a huge steak)   The cinnamon monkey bread... OMG I don't even know where to begin. It was divine! I am still dreaming about that dessert. It looks like a donut and it's just dripping with sauce and when u put it in your mouth, it's so soft and it practically melts. The ice cream they served with it was equally good and together, it was heaven. Definitely worth getting. (on a side note, all their desserts looked really good and I wish I had room to order more.)   Everything else, service, ambiance etc. were all good. Basically what I expected at such this type of restaurant. They were also very cool because they let us split credit cards. We had like 8 of them and they didn't have an issue with doing that. (I know some restaurants don't allow you to do it) Overall I was very pleased with my experience at this restaurant and would come back.",

The food quality, top notch service, and understated simplicity of the place make it a great choice for a romantic dinner for two in Vegas.    My boyfriend and I ordered the special, limited edition Summer Tasting Menu, which was a prixe-fixe three-course steal at $60/person.  We were served our first course-  a fennel salad, cucumber salad, quail drumettes, and a bruschetta with creamiest, melt-in-your-mouth fresh mozzarella.  The second course was scallops, two different types of steak with two deliciously mild sauces (i like my steak to taste like STEAK, not A-1, thanks!), mashed potatoes with chives, shiitake mushrooms, and our favorite...the fresh cut corn with brown butter.  The chef's choice for dessert was a citrus/cherry cobbler with tangerine ice cream, and a molten chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.  The molten chocolate cake was to DIE for.  Try it!  I only left off one star because we both thought two of the dishes were really, really salty.  But really, no major complaints here.    The decor is modern industrial, with really cool elements of glass, steel, wood, and dim lighting.  The painting hung in the back of the restaurant is gorgeous as well.  Beautiful and intimate.  Service can't be beat!",

    "text": "There's not much I can say about Craftsteak that hasn't already been said.  It is BY FAR the best restaurant I've eaten at.    I do have recommendations though.  I did some pretty deep research on the perfect steakhouse before we left for Vegas.  I ended on Craftsteak, and after all the rave reviews, I wanted to do the American Wagyu tasting menu.  My husband was not too thrilled about some of the selections we were going to get, and we almost ordered off the menu ourselves.  But at the last minute, I said NO, we have to do it.  So we got the tasting menu.    First, I would have needed a cow's four stomachs to eat all the food they brought us. I ate some stuff I normally would not eat. And I'm so glad I did! I'll go through the highlights (and what I'll order next time so I don't waste all the beautiful delicious food I can't eat)  Kobe steak tartare - I have never eaten raw beef before. I never wanted to eat raw beef. It tastes so good cooked, why eat it raw?  Well I stand corrected. Maybe the best weird thing I've ever had. I ate over half the plate of meat.  I felt my inner tigress coming out and I apologized to my husband in advance in case I bit him later.   Mushroom Sampler - Eat all the \"Hen of the Woods\" (maitake) variety.  Normally I cannot stand mushrooms, but the waiter said they were good so I figured hey, I just ate raw beef, what's a little fungus?  The mushroom tasted like rich beef and red wine. Very complex, smokey flavor.  I will seek them out around here, because they were SO good.  American Wagyu skirt steak - skip the more expensive rib eye.  Go for the skirt. It was so good we barely touched the rib eye.  Literally melted in your mouth. Worth the $130 a pop alone.  They also brought us four deserts, but just looking at them I felt my stomach perforating and spilling into my body cavity.  Gross visual, but that's how full I was.  On a side note, we both noticed the food gave us MAD GAS!  Not that I cared, but jusy FYI... I guess raw meat has its drawbacks.",

The ambiance is romantic, most restaurants a person cant even hear their own thoughts let alone their company, but the noise from table to table was tolerable.  Very pricey, but I believe you get what you pay for.  Me and my boyfriend chose to get the Surf and Turf pre-fixed menu.. Which was 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, 3 sides - of our choice and 3 deserts that were chosen by the chief.  Let me tell you, every bite was heaven. it was evenly proportioned, and my mouth is watering as i think about it..  I had the best lobster I've ever had, the steak was tender and flavorful.   It is a MUST GO!!! if your wanting to do something special for your man or woman.",

Very nice decor and the employees are all very attractive (it is las vegas) but if you look like an average joe, you were treated like you should be so lucky to even be served. We were a party of 8 celebrating a friends 40th.  Just the guys weekend to eat, drink and be merry. The waitress/model/actress was polite but cold.  I think she thought we all had a budget so she didn't want to waste to much time with us.  most of us ordered the Waygu steak.  Very good but nowhere near worth the $110 per order.  Had a few order the lobster.  Nothing to rave about.  The best part of the evening was the wine.  At least for the rest of the guys.  Beer and scotch for me.  This was the first time I've ever seen a bill for a party less than 50 for $4000!  of course for parties more than 6, the gratuity of 15% is automatically included.  Even if the service was 2nd rate.  We all chopped the bill up equally ($500 per person).  I may go back for my 50th or when I win a lottery.",

    "text": "Hubby and I ate at Craftsteak recently for our anniversary dinner for 2 reasons: I am a serious carnivore, and we both are big fans of Top Chef.  The decor was interesting, but there were parts of the restaurant that were just too dark. I was glad we were seated in a better lighted main dining room. The service was stellar the entire night.  For an appetizer we had the Hawaiian prawns, which were good, but maybe a tad salty and chewy for my taste. The cured meat platter was a huge hit with my husband. It had about 4 varieties of salamis and prosciutto along with soft pretzel mini-baguettes. The purple peppercorn dipping sauce was amazing, with a very complex flavor.  For his entree, Hubby had the Kobe flat iron steak, which he really liked, but to me, it wasn't that great- maybe he had it too rare for my taste. I had the rib-eye, which had a slightly sweet crust that was a bit too blackened  in parts. The meat itself was perfectly cooked (medium-rare), and was delicious over all. It was far too much for one person. As side dishes, we had the Yukon gold puree (delicious) and a mushroom mix (not on the menu but offered by our waitress). The hen-of-the-woods was our favorite by far. I will definitely get just that next time- the other mushrooms were fine, but not outstanding like the hen.  For dessert, we tried the ice cream & sorbet sampler. There were 6 reasonably sized scoops: chocolate (good), peanut butter (outstanding), caramel (OK), melon (great if you like cantaloupe), coconut (good), and strawberry (outstanding).  All in all, with a great tip, and one cocktail apiece, the damage was $260.",

    "text": "I love Tom Colicchio and was so excited to come here....but I was not impressed.   We made reservations here for our last night in Vegas and we both just wanted a really nice, juicy steak. I first ordered the fresh mozzarella \"salad\" - this wasn't a salad. It was fresh mozzarella topped with a tomato concoction. It was tasty but I was expecting more of a salad since it was listed under the salads. My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque and was very happy with it because it had big chunks of lobster.   For our meals, we each ordered a 10oz filet, shitake mushrooms, asparagus, and au gratin potatoes. We were brought our food and both of our filets were room temperature..not hot at all. We don't like to make a scene and we were hungry so we sucked it up. Also, we both ordered our filets medium...the meat was pink on the inside and cooked on the outside, but they were not very tender and were actually pretty dry. The asparagus was asparagus, the shitakes were good, and the potatoes were alright. We didn't even bother with dessert.  All in all, it was a mediocre meal that we paid way too much for. I'd rather eat at Ruth's Chris anyday. Actually - the meal we ate at Wolfgang Puck in the MGM was about 10 times better than this meal.   Step up your game, Tom Colicchio!!!",

    "text": "Part of my Vegas traditions is to hit up the steakhouse at the hotel I am staying at. I love steak and I am somewhat of a steak snob. This was the best steak I have ever had hands down. I ordered the Black Angus Filet Mignon and it was amazing. I like my steak on the rare side and when I go to a place that specializes in steak I go medium rare cause they actually know how to do that right. It was perfectly cooked. It was tender and juicy and every bite melted in my mouth. It was a pretty thick steak too but it was still so tender and soft. The knife just went right through it with ease. For my side I ordered the lobster bisque soup and it was good but I have  had better lobster bisque than this at the Luxor steakhouse. It was not as creamy as I would have looked but there was plenty of lobster in it and that was good. It was not bad just not that best. For dessert I went with the caramel cheesecake. It was a hard choice because they have an awesome dessert menu. It was a good choice though. It was downright decadent! It had a perfect mix of caramel and cheesecake flavor. Neither one was overbearing. It was rich and creamy. Every bite was pure heaven! That meal was more than enough to fill me up.   Not only was the food amazing but so was the customer service. Since I was dining solo I ate at the bar. My server JT was great. He engaged me in great conversation about where we both come from and how he ended up living in Vegas. He was a great server and had awesome customer service skills. I really enjoyed my meal here and would like to come back some day.",

    "text": "Yelp let us down this time.  I debated between 1 and 2 stars but settled on 2 because the steak (reason we came here) was good.  Ambiance was OK but we made a reservation and were seated in the bar area.  This was annoying.  Another couple sat down next to us and complained about it and were re-seated at a table.  So I guess if you complain they give you a better table?  The restaurant wasn't full (7PM on a Saturday night), so I'm not sure why we were seated in the bar area with a reservation.    Appetizers: We got shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque soup.  Soup was good, big chunks of lobster in it, shrimp coctail was good but size of shrimp was very small considering the price.    We ordered all of our food when we sat down and told our waitress that we were in a hurry and were very hungry, so please bring the food as fast as possible.  We then waited an hour for our steaks.  I didn't like how the menu had two options for steaks - grilled or roasted, the roasted was 20% more and our waitress offered very little information about the difference between the two.  Here is my take - I don't know what is the best way to cook a steak - I think the restaurant should have their method and sell it as the best method.  We ordered one of each thinking we could try each others to see the difference.  Unfortunately, the waitress brought us two of the same steaks and when we figured out they weren't what we ordered, there was no offer to bring another one, or anything other than a meek apology from our waitress.   Steaks were good, but mine was luke warm, like it had been sitting for 15 minutes warm.    Got the broccolini and gratin potato for sides, both were very good.    Each had a glass of the house Pino and was good but pricey @ $17 / glass.    Ordered the apple vanilla crisp for desert and it was fantastic but way overpriced @ $15.    Total before tip was $250.  Very disappointing experience, much better options on the strip, not sure how this place got such high marks.",

The service was pushy and unknowledgeable, the steak was subpar and the wine was overpriced. Craftsteak is completely overrated.   I would expect a $60 filet to melt in my mouth, but mine was dry, tough and flavorless.   The wine was excellent (Nickel and Nickel) but that's because I know enough about wine to ignore my server. He kept trying to push their \"featured wine\" which he insisted was \"the best deal on the menu.\" It was a $35 (grocery store price) William Hill Bench that Craftsteak was selling for $135. The majority of wines were 3x what you would pay for at a liquor store when the typical markup is 2x. Luckily, I know enough about wine to know what's a ripoff and what's not. I feel sorry for those who don't and end up getting screwed.",

    "text": "Craftsteak is an upscale steakhouse neatly tucked away in the enormous opulent MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. It's a beautiful restaurant with stunning decor. It's running a close second only to the gorgeous decor at Stack inside The Mirage.  We were greeted by one of the hosts right away and we were seated in probably 3 minutes or less even though we were about 20 minutes early. The entire staff was excellent, everyone was very friendly. Beverages were refilled promptly and so was the fabulous bread that they start you with. The bread looked like Hawaiian/ pretzel bread with some coarse salt sprinkled on top delivered nice and hot to the table in a small rectangular tin. The bread was excellent!  We ordered the Caesar salad to start, however the salad wasn't quite what I expected. They serve you an enormous portion of romaine lettuce that's uncut... Yes.. uncut. I have never had to put in so much work to eat one salad! I nearly broke a sweat. They also put a couple of small anchovies on top of the salad as well. Those quickly found a home somewhere off to the side of my plate. The croutons were awesome though.  We ordered the rib eye bone in, risotto, & fingerling potatoes. Unfortunately, the rib eye didn't live up to expectations. It was under seasoned and didn't have that fall off the bone quality that I like. It was a good steak but didn't reach the championship level of Mesa Grill or The Steakhouse. The risotto on the other hand was excellent! Excellent flavor no doubt, my regards to the chef. The risotto is something you MUST order at this restaurant. Overall, a great dining experience that I highly recommend.",

    "text": "We came out for date night on April 17th, 2015 for dinner at 7pm.  Was immediately walked to our table and given the menu.  The hot item to order was the Chef's Menu and a lot of other tables got it.    We went with the basic Chef's Menu and it was a lot of food. Now I'm not slouch when it comes to over ordering, but holy shit, do you get so many items to try.  The break down for a table of two is: you get 3 salads to share, 2 soup of the day, 2 entrees, 3 side dishes and 1 Chef's choice dessert.  For intro, we got the salads, which comprised of a Caesar Salad, a Spinach Salad and a Italian Buffalo Mozzarella.  Now the server said this was small, sharable size, it was still a decent size. We killed the salads but that was where we made our rookie mistake, at this point, we were starting to get filled up.  For main course: she had the 18 oz bone in grilled rib eye and I had the 16 oz roasted New York bone in Steak.  I liked a tougher cut but I can see how others might not like the New York because it was a bit tougher than I would have liked. For her ribeye, it was very tender, almost like a Filet, but my gf enjoyed it.  Both steaks came pre-cut, which is nice, I'm just not a fan of pre-cut meat.  The downside is the meat lacked enough seasoning, but it had what I thought was a wine-based au jus so it covered up for the lack of seasoning.  For sides: we went with baby carrots, mushrooms assortments and house favorite Potato puree.  The carrots were purple carrots and in the dark light, it looked like beets.  the carrots tastes fine but I HATED beets, so the relations did not help enjoy the meal.  The mushroom assorts was unremarkable, I'm glad we got the smaller version, bc if we ordered the full order, I would have been disappointed.  The Potato Puree was pretty good as advertised, it was very creamy and had lots of flavor.    At this point, you're pretty much wiped out.  So we had them box all the sides and most of the steaks.  Thinking that was the end of the meal, we got our dessert platter.  You get some italian ice, some baked buns, and some salted creamy dessert.  If you weren't full, you are inhumane at the end of this meal.  The meal was enjoyable, and the service was attentive.  The runners/assistant waiters were on top of everything and replaced items without asking.   The Chefs menu was $125 per person plus alc/taxes/tip, came out to be $301.  MGM gave me $100 resort credit so that really helped with the tab.  Would I come again? absolutely, but probably a bigger group would be better for the Chef's menu. The idea behind it is great, because big groups always struggle with what they like to eat, so this way you can share bits of everything.  But for smaller tables, such as couples, you're just a gluttonous fatass if you think you can eat all that food.    Yes! That would make me a gluttonous fatass.",

The lobster bisque is worth the trip alone however the rest of my family got the Cesar salad and although the anchovies were delicious the salads were underwhelming. My daughter ordered the trio of Seafood and it was amazing. The rest of us got the steak and it was precut and not as hot as I like it. I'm not sure why they precut the steak, we didn't enjoy that at all. The service was great until we wanted to leave and could t find anyone to bring us our bill. The food was delicious but nothing was over the top or unique at all. I was disappointed to spend that kind of money for nothing all that special. To be honest, the steaks and sides are better at Ruth's Chris or Flemings & a lot cheaper. Good food but disappointing for cost.",

    "text": "I so wanted to love this place, but I did not really enjoy my experience here. But let me explain... First of all, this place just oozes class and manages to have impeccable, attentive service without straying into the stuffy type of service that makes you feel uncomfortable (see my review on Alexander's Steakhouse in San Francisco). We had nothing but gracious and wonderful service throughout our meal. I would give 5 stars for that. The food, however, was a disappointment to me. And a big part of that is just for personal reasons. I have trouble chewing due to a previous jaw surgery, and the vegetables here are cooked so lightly that they are still crunchy. While that might be great for someone who is looking for a vegetable so fresh that it tastes like it was just pulled from the ground, but I prefer things to be cooked just a little more tender so I can actually chew them. Even hubby found them too hard. The flavor was nice, but it needs a little more time on the stove IMO. Hubby's steak was good and cooked as he ordered it. I ordered the scallops. I was so disappointed at the flavor of the scallops. It arrived with about a half dozen scallops and I took a bite of the first one and it just tasted so fishy. Fishy doesn't even begin to describe it. It actually almost made me a little sick. Now, I've had this happen before where there has been a bad one in the bunch (and I don't fault the chef for this, I think it's just the luck of the draw of the harvest) and so I tried a little bite out of about four of them and only found one that tasted fresh and palatable, so I just ate that one. Unfortunately there was no hiding the fact that I didn't eat my dish, so our server asked about it and I had to admit I didn't like it. I wasn't expecting him to do anything because I don't think it had anything to do with how it was cooked, but he took it off the bill anyway. I thought that was so very nice. Overall I think that if you like crunchy vegetables and want to stick to steak, then you will probably love this place. It is also a lovely, quiet respite from the noise of the casino floor. You will forget where you are while dining at this place. So if that's what you're looking for, then I would recommend you try this place.",

We had to wait a bit by the bar while our table was ready, but it was no big deal... there was a good hockey game on (not a hockey fan but it was a GREAT game).  While we waited at the bar we tried the oysters, shrimp and a few other appetizers. Nothing to write home about.  When we finally sat in the table, we ordered an assortment of angus beef, all the different cuts... Ribeye, NY Strip and Filet Mignon... etc...  Everything was delicious... cooked perfectly and with so much flavor. I think about it and I'm hungry again.  As for the sides, they were rich and had great flavor. Mashed potatoes, onions, asparagus, mushrooms and risotto. The people at our table seemed to enjoy the risotto the most... I personally was just banging on the steak and some of the vegetables.  To end the meal we tried the desserts... we ordered some sort of sampler that had  one of each. All of them excellent. have to pick just one? The Monkey Bread.  The service at craft is the best we had in Las Vegas.   I highly recommend craft. Its an experience but it is VERY expensive... even for Vegas. But it is Tom Colicchio...",

High class all the way, I have never felt more under-dressed but the staff was so cool Victor, Edgar, and Oscar were on point.  We started off with a round of drinks, I figured sense we are in Vegas I should have a Nevada brew. The Tenaya Creek IPA was excellent along with the grilled calamari. My lady got the surf and turf while I got the dry aged T-Bone for our entree. Everything was cooked to perfection, that T-Bone steak with the filet and the skirt steak melts. baby spinach and roasted asparagus to compliment all that beautiful red meat.  Their beer and wine selection was fantastic, I believe they have over a 1000 different bottles to choice from. I also enjoyed the Dogfish 60Minute IPA on tap. To top off the night the table shared their infamous Cinnamon monkey bread and the strawberry shortcake. The atmosphere is wonderful, one of the best meals of my life.",

    "text": "I want to preface this by saying that I'm not made of money, so I don't go to restaurants like this. Therefore I have no basis of comparison with other high price restaurants.  Having said that, this was easily the best meal I've ever had.   First, a side not, I wouldn't take too much from the people giving this place very low reviews. Perhaps some did somehow have a bad experience, but look at all the people who had a great experience. I think you most likely will too. And anyone complaining about how Tom is never there, give the man a break. He has over a dozen restaurants, a TV Show, and has a young son and lives on the East Coast. What, do you expect him to be at all his restaurants each month?  Okay, end rant. Now to the food. I went with my brother and his girlfriend. We each had the American Wagyu chef's tasting course. It would have been nice to pick dishes a la carte, but thought this was easier.  The bread was great. The salads were good too. I even enjoyed the beets, and I normally don't like beets.  The potato puree was very smooth, creamy and flavorful. The mushroom course was great too.  The steak was soooo good. The skirt steak and ribeye were both amazing. Tender, flavorful, and juicy. The quality of the beef was top notch. I've had Kobe beef in Kobe, and it is almost as good.  The desserts were also top notch, from the monkey bread to the cheesecake to the ice creams and the sorbets.  Since we weren't dressed for the occasion, we had to sit up at the bar, but it was no problem. The bartender was very knowledgeable and very personable. Service was great, but it was the beginning of dinner service, so I don't know what it's like at the tables on a busy night.  With a beer, a glass of wine, and the food plus tax and tip, it came out to $200 each. But since it was so amazing, and also I was up $100 from the poker table that day, it was worth every penny.",

We ordered the wagyu rib eye that's very reasonably priced. The wagyu was a slight disappointment - you would expect the marbly fat, rich taste, and melt-in-your-mouth type of feeling. I don't recall feeling any of that during dinner. However, it was a descent piece of meat, and although I won't be trying the wagyu again, maybe a regular piece of meat will do for next time. For the wagyu, I'll still be hitting up CUT in the Palazzo.   Some other tips/info: - mushroom sampler - awesome if you are a mushroom fan! - sunchoke - what a surprise - still can't really describe what it is since it was our first time having it, but we loved it - it's a must get - service was spectacular! - great wine selection",

    "text": "My wife and I were staying at the MGM Grand for 311 Day, and we decided to have a nice meal at Craftsteak on 3/10.  Here is what we ordered:  - Market Spinach Salad to start (pretty good, kind of plain though) - Kurobuta Pork Chop, which is what I ordered (Very tasty, but a little overcooked) - Sea Bass (my wife ordered this and liked it) - Risotto on the side (good but needed seasoning, my wife liked it more than I did) - Creme Brulee for dessert (nothing special at all, and neither one of us liked the ice cream that came with it)  The service was attentive, but when a manager came by to check on us she did not know what was served with my wife's Sea Bass (turned out to be some sort of mushroom).  I was kind of surprised by that since I love watching shows like Restaurant Impossible, and the host always rips servers for not knowing the menu.  Without our experience afterwards I would give the meal a 3 star rating.  My wife would have gave it at least a 4.  Here is where the 1 star comes in.  My wife had a horrible case of food poisoning about 8 hours after we ate.  It was bad enough that we called hotel security about it, as we were concerned she would have to go to the hospital.  The only thing that we didn't share the entire day was the fish, so it is pretty easy to tell it was the culprit.  We actually filed a report with the MGM Grand, and we were told someone from the restaurant would be contacting us to check on her.  She did not have anything to drink that night other than a glass of wine with dinner, so alcohol was not a factor at all.  Luckily she was alright the next day and it didn't ruin our trip.  No one from the restaurant ever contacted us to see if she was alright, but I'm pretty sure they were informed because I noticed on the online menu that the Sea Bass isn't there anymore!  There is a blank space where it should be (I just looked at the menu to verify the exact names of what we ordered).  It was between the salmon and surf & turf.  I was disappointed that I spent close to $200 on a dinner that made my wife violently ill, and that is why they get 1 star.  That should not happen at a fine restaurant like this, and they should have reached out to us afterwards since we were guests at the hotel.",

I had the fillet and it was good, but not overly impressive this time..  My wife on the other hand had the short ribs and they were to die for.  I kept stealing bites from her plate... it was very generous portion by the way.  I kept stealing bites and she still had extra to take back to the hotel room.  My wife loves their whipped potatoes so we just shared those... they are really delicious  I told the water that my wife loves Creme Brulee but they did not have it on the menu.  A few minutes later her came back and said the Pastry Chef is here and would be happy to make it for her.  It was the best she ever had.  By the way I highly recommend having a cup of coffee at the end... it was really really good  The price is a little on the expensive side, but not too expensive compared to other fine dining in Vegas.",

I know it is a steak house, but isnt like every restaurant in Vegas a type of steak house?  Therefore I had to stop eating steak at some point and try something else.  Can I say underwhelmed?

    "text": "Restaurant Week '10 was the perfect excuse to get into Craftsteak.  I am a fan of Colicchio and had been thinking about going for quite some time, plus Restaurant Week supports 3-Square which is a worthwhile charity.  We had an easy time getting reservations for our party of 3, and when we arrived, we were seated promptly.  It took a while for our server to get our drink orders (my only complaint, really), but the bartender didn't skimp on the good stuff.    The inside of the restaurant was gorgeous, subtle lighting, earthy colors, and it isn't loud inside.  I would strongly recommend a reservation on a weekend night, though; it looked like people who were waiting for a table were put at the entrance right along the shopping area outside - very bright and noisy.  The special menu for Restaurant Week was a great value because instead of choosing one option from the menu for each course, they were all delivered to our table and served family style along with hot buttery rolls.  First course was a fennel salad, fresh buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts and roasted red pepper, a cucumber and watercress salad and some super delicious quail.  All four dishes had flavors that complimented each other; it wasn't a haphazard selection.  I keep writing that the quail was the star and then deleting it thinking, \"no the mozzarella was so delicate, the cucumber salad so crisp and refreshing.\"  It was all great.  The main course was a selection of prime beef flat iron, grilled skirt steak, and diver scallops.  The scallops were to die for, but the steak was good too.  Despite thinking of skirt steak as something I buy to cut into strips for stir fry or steak sandwiches, I preferred it over the flat iron.  It had a really flavorful crust and was tender and juicy.  I didn't know skirt steak could be made like that!  We also had 3 sides to go with our meats: shitake mushrooms, yukon gold potato puree (yum!), and sweet corn with green onions.  We ate all of the potato puree and sweet corn, but the shitake mushrooms were a little bland compared to everything else.    For dessert we had a selection of chocolate panacotta, cheesecake with blackberries, and a pastry with peaches and raspberry sorbet.  Get the chocolate pannacotta.  You will be happy.  I really enjoyed myself at Craftsteak, especially after the disappointment that was Mesa Grill.  I'd like to go back and try a \"fancier\" cut of beef off the a la carte menu, but I can't complain about the taste and value of the meal I had for Restaurant Week.",

This restaurant is definitely on our list when we return to Vegas next month.",

    "text": "WOW! That's the first word that comes to mind when it comes to Craftsteak. After all the superb recommendations, we had to come here to give it a try while at Vegas.   We looked at the menu days/weeks before so we already knew what to order. We started out with the lobster bisque. I ordered the braised short ribs and hubby ordered the Kobe Waygu skirt steak with a side of hen of the woods mushrooms.   The lobster bisque is the best I ever tasted. It has chunks of lobster in it which is rare since I have tried others. The short ribs were tender, succulent, filled with robust flavors and melted in my mouth. I tried some of the Kobe waygu which was cooked to a medium perfection. If you never tried this type of beef, it is definitely worth the money. It is just different in a VERY good way. If you are a mushroom lover such as myself, you will like the Hen of the woods mushroom. I am not sure if they season it or how they cooked it, but it was delicious. It has a great earthy taste with a great texture that is hard to describe.   We also tried their Chocolate souffle and oh my, oh my....it was warm, chocolaty and satisfying. Dinner was so good, we didn't want to end it so quickly so along with the souffle, we ordered the banana brown sugar ice cream.   Eating here was just a blast and I can't wait to go back. From the atmosphere to the EXCELLENT service, there is nothing to complain about.   By the way, the complimentary dinner rolls are also addicting. It comes to your table warm and slightly salted on the top.",

I had the foie gras as an appetizer and it was delicious, but a little on the oily side. I greedily left none on the plate and will order it again if I return, since it is about to be banned in my wonderful home state.  My rib eye was cooked well, but really nothing to write home about and I am a fan of bone in meat.  My girl likes meat too and ordered the filet, hers was delicious.  Apparently she was quite happy with the meat that she received that night. She liked the steak too! ;)",

Kobe wagyu tartare, fucking delicious. Service was impeccable, bartender knowledgeable, we had a semi private table in a room for our bachelor's party.

    "text": "We had a 6:30 reservation for dinner prior to a 9:30 show.  We were seated promptly and politely.  Our server was jovial and reasonably helpful.  There were three people in our party, so we ended up with three different apps, steaks, and sides, and then shared a dessert.  Everything was executed reasonably well, but not amazing.  I think our appetizers were better than the actual steaks.  I had the beet salad with roasted beets and pickeled eggs.  I think that the salad lacked a bit of acid, but overall good.  Another person had the quail appetizer and thought it was tasty.  We ordered braised kale, sweet potato puree, and brussels sprouts as sides.  I felt that the sweet potatoes were too sweet, and could have used some salt to contrast, but another in my party enjoyed them.  The steaks were average.  I felt like mine was almost over-salted and tough, but maybe that's the nature of the cut (flatiron).  I ordered it because it was the only 8-oz steak on the menu.  I would have preferred an impeccably prepared 6-oz filet.  There was also a strip steak and a bone-in ribeye at the table.  They were fine.  Not great, not bad, just fine.  I would say that I've had dramatically better steaks at Ruth's Chris and Capital Grille.  It's a bit dissapointing that we've had better meals at major chain steak houses.  Overall, I probably wouldn't go back.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't the fantastic experience I was looking for.  I think that for the hype and reviews, I was expecting to be wowed, and I was a bit underwhelmed.  I didn't leave hungry, but I was a little bummed/disappointed/bored.  The best part of the meal was the monkey bread with sour cream ice cream.  I would have that again any day...",

My husband and I came in VERY excited to be back b/c we both had been for bachelor/bachelorette parties but never alone.   We had a couple of complaints:  1) Our meal wasn't paced. The server opened our wine immediately but didn't follow up with the bread. We had to ask for the bread and then our food came out very quickly afterwards.  2) This all would have been fine but we ordered the Wagyu ribeye and it fell flat. My previous experience with that cut was amazing but this was meh...   The caesar salad, bread, sides and monkey bread was delish but the star dish just didn't shine. :(  I would give it one more shot (doing the regular rib eye therefore reducing cost & enjoying the delish sides) but if you're set to do one super nice meal in Vegas, I'd do Le Cirque. Their service was top notch as was their food. It was a bit stuffy but you can liven it up depending on the party. :)",

It was 3 courses where you would select the steak type and everything's else was up to the chefs. Come hungry! The first course came out quick and my favorites are the bread, prosciutto and figs and wagyu tartare. The second course is the steak and the sides. We ordered domestic wagyu filet and it's a huge cut. The dessert was my favorite. Monkey bread was melt in your mouth. Highly recommend this place for food and value.",

Within that description, everyone should expect to pay more for the quality and experience.    This review is mostly to cancel out the strangest complaint I've heard in a long time.  We were just there recently and heard a woman complaining that there weren't enough vegan entree' options at a steak house.  There were more than enough side dish options that she could have combined to make a nice sizable meal, but with most vegans, it isn't really about what they eat.  It's about what others eat.  This last time we were there, we enjoyed the Tasting Menu which gives you a nice sampling of each meal course.  Because the menu is seasonal, it's not on the menu and has to be requested.  We've been there many times and have never been disappointed by the meal or the service.  I highly recommend you let the Chef's show off and ask for the Tasting Menu.  You won't be disappointed...unless you're a vegan.",

The heirloom cauliflower was incredible. The carrots with honey were incredible. The buffalo mozzarella was incredible  The heirloom tomato's were perfect.

    "text": "This was an awesome steakhouse. While I am always skeptical to eat at restaurants that have celebrity names attached to them because so many times it has average food and bad service. This place was everything that a celebrity chef's restaurant should be. The food was amazing (one of our favorites was the steak tartar) and the service was just as amazing.  Our server was attentive and gave great advice when it came to helping us create our dinning experience.   While the food was a bit on the pricier side, sometimes you have to treat yourself because you are in Vegas.",

    "text": "My bf and I dined together on Thursday night at Craftsteak and the service was worse this time around than last year. We didn't get any bread to start and had to ask for some when our appetizer arrived. This apparently inconvenienced our busser as he looked extremely annoyed. In fact, he looked annoyed at us the whole night and never once smiled or made any eye contact. Once we finished our appetizer, our server told us it would be \"just a few minutes\" before our entrees arrived. We waited a literal 30 minutes before they arrived (I checked). During this time, he did not check on us or explain the long wait. He actually never came back the rest of the night. Another server (I believe his name was Joe) took over, was actually friendly and professional, and made sure we were doing okay.   Food was amazing as always. The scallops are a must. The NY and hanger steak were prepared perfectly. The hanger steak had a great char on the outside but still juicy on the inside. The white corn grits and fingerling potatoes were delicious as well, while the cauliflower was just okay. The tropical mango cheesecake was absolutely amazing.   The hostesses acknowledged our anniversary which I appreciated, however, none of our servers did at all. Food is great, but unfortunately, it does not make up for the terrible service both times we dined. We won't return.",

    "text": "Top Chef personality and James Beard Award-winning Chef Tom Colicchio brings the Steak ruckus on the Las Vegas Strip.   When Craftsteak landed at MGM Grand in 2002, a new standard was set for the Las Vegas steakhouse. Now the Strip is the steakhouse center of the universe and the choices are seemingly endless - yet Craftsteak remains on the shortlist for almost any carnivore looking for a righteous cut of Beef (or otherwise) while in Sin City. The interior exudes class and sophistication plus the service doesn't let the swagger of the digs or kitchen down at any moment. If you don't feel like you are in a real deal Steakhouse... Well, that is on you.   The menu changes daily but you can count on most (if not all) Beef cuts to be available on any given day and they are prepared either by grill or pan sear. Neither of which you can go wrong with as I can attest to. The restaurant offers a Prix Fixe - and it is a good one to boot - but you are best served by choosing your own cut and then sharing the sides family style. This way you get your Steak your way and everyone enjoys the sides in a communal fashion. The prices are on par with any in LA/OC Steakhouse which basically means they are obscene or fair depending on your stomach for a Steakhouse bill.   Like any stark, raving mad carnivore I love Ribeye, Filet, and Strip Steak - but as an aficionado of the sport I was immediately drawn to the 10 ounce Black Angus Hangar Steak (a consummate steal at $38.00) thanks to the near perfect blend of fat/meat ratio and a mouthfeel so divine your very own butcher saves the cut for friends and family. Craftsteak puts together a very, very gratifying specimen of a Hangar Steak. Softly charred outside, buttery meat within, and a mouthfeel worthy of the gods. You really have to try this, it is that good (Yelp - italics would help with descriptions such as this...).   Happy. Stoked. Loved. Pick your superlative.   The side courses are also mesmerizing and deserve a review of their own but that isn't why you are reading this review, right? It doesn't matter much anyway thanks to them changing daily so go with the server's recommendation and get the cut of your fancy and enjoy.   Craftsteak is the absolute realness. Try it yourself and tell me that I am wrong.",

I sat at the bar, where both the bartender (Mark I believe) and the servers were attentive while not intrusive. My meal was quite possibly the best steak I've ever had. Requested medium & was served medium ++. The steak was both juicy and nicely seasoned. Seared perfectly. I chose pureed potatoes as my side, which were creamy & well seasoned. Everything is a la carte & portions are big. They give you an option to order 1/2 side. Glad I chose that option. All in all, great experience.",

    "text": "I love a good steak dinner when I travel to Vegas. I've stayed at the MGM over a handful of times and can't believe I never tried Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak until last Thursday evening.   Although my husband and I ran a little late getting to the restaurant from the Delano hotel, the hostess was still very welcoming and seated us right away. She pulled my chair out for me and handed me my napkin. The two waiters we had were very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. They were on point with their service making sure the food was good our drinks were filled, and explaining our courses.   We chose to do the tasting menu and boy were we satisfied and pleased with our choice! Some reviewers were saying the portions were small for what you pay for. You should expect to be paying more when you're going to a nice steakhouse. You're paying for quality and the experience. Although pricey, it was well worth it in our opinion and we definitely felt like we had more than enough food.   We chose the appetizers, sides and meat courses. We had the chef choose the dessert. The free buttery salt crusted dinner rolls were so damn good!   Our first course consisted of the Heirloom Tomato Salad, Italian Buffalo Mozzarella Salad, Prosciutto San Daniele and Shrimp Cocktail. The heirloom tomatoes were so fresh and good, topped with basil and a balsamic reduction. The mozzarella actually was better when paired with the heirloom tomato salad. The chilled shrimp were jumbo in size and plump with cocktail sauce made in house. You know it's a nice place when you're served 4-5 pieces of shrimp rather than 3 pieces when you're a party of two. The prosciutto was great and more slices than I expected were served.   For the second course, we went with the domestic wagyu Filet Mignon and the domestic wagyu Ribeye. Both great choices!! Both cuts of meat were so tender and cooked to perfection. OMG the filet just melted in the mouth and the ribeye had such great flavor!! The meat was already sliced making it easier to share. Our sides included asparagus, assortment of mushrooms and the potato puree. The asparagus was average, nothing to rave about. The mushrooms were okay and were my least favorite. They lacked flavor. I would prefer to try something different next time like the risotto, carrots or maui onions. The potato puree was amazing!! I'm glad we chose that side. So creamy and the chives perfectly complimented it.   So much dessert was brought out. We couldn't believe the amount of food we were tasting. The dessert course included creme brulee, monkey bread, sorbet and fresh fruit. The monkey bread served with ice cream was AMAZEBALLS! I would go back just for that...I tried so hard not to eat it all. The creme brulee was divine with fresh strawberries. The sorbet was very refreshing.   The only thing I didn't like was the lady walking around asking if you want your picture taken. I think a nice place like that shouldn't allow for that, it's cheesy especially when you have to buy the pictures.   We definitely would go back!",

    "text": "One of my top 3 favorite steakhouses in Las Vegas.  Service is superb and the food is even better. I have to rave about the bread they bring out to you after you're seated. Freshly baked, warm bread with salt sprinkled on top. I have to refrain myself from asking for more and just getting full off of the bread.   I highly recommend starting your meal with the prosciutto and pear. They have prosciutto and fig only during certain seasons which I've been dying to try but I was quite pleased with the prosciutto and pear. They have a small variety of oysters to choose from if you like oysters. Never a bad idea to enjoy some oysters before a steak dinner!  The bone-in ribeye here is SO tasty. I went with my usual medium and it wasn't overcooked or undercooked. Seasoning gets an A from me! The sides were good but none stuck out to me. I'm a pretty die hard carnivore when I go to steakhouses and am usually too busy stuffing my face with ribeye to pay attention to the sides.  Great steakhouse Tom Colicchio! I've been here a handful of times and will be back again soon.",

This is a solid steakhouse and delivers on expectations. it has a nice modern sophisticated feel and you can almost forget you are in a casino. I started out with a mozzarella and hazelnut salad that had nice textures and fresh ingredients. Then I got a roasted filet and the potato puree. As mentioned by others the potato puree was sinful and honestly I would go back just for more. The steak, was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. I just wish there was an option for a steak smaller then 10oz as I could not finish and I don't like to take food back to my room. They did have a smaller half size version of the salad and potatoes, so that helped. I wish I could have ordered dessert, but I was too full. The service was great, the bartender made great recommendations and made everyone at the bar feel welcome. If you are staying at the MGM,  and in the mood for steak, this is your place.",

I had the bone in ny strip and potato puree Impeccably cooked steak, great service, concerned staff, especially the manager (walked the tables but gave the impression he really wanted to hear feedback rather just the perfunctory how are you. Don't get some of the negative feedback on the potatoes, they were great, probably have to swim ten miles to make up for them, but well worth it.  Loved the entree served in its own serve my dish....would definitely come back....",

    "text": "If you're going to eat here, do the tasting menu. It's a ton of food but it's a great deal. You get 4 appetizers/salads, two main dishes with two sides, and 3 desserts (4 if it's your birthday!) The service was impeccable. We had two waitresses, both very knowledgeable about the wine and food. Our waitress recommended merlot for me after asking two questions about my taste in wine, which is crazy because I didn't tell her merlot is my favorite! My only complaint was that our ribeye came out uncut, and it was supposed to be sliced for us, but the food and rest of our service was so good, I didn't even care. Thoughts about the food:  The warm frisee salad was AMAZING. If you like bacon and blue cheese, get it. We also got the peach spinach salad which was mediocre, the charcuterie board (was good) shrimp cocktail (really good) and the assorted mushrooms, which I was not a fan of. Bland and weird textures. The button mushrooms were good, though. On to the main course: The grilled ribeye was amazing. Way better than the filet. You can ask for certain dishes but we let the chef pick. The filet was average. It tasted a little under seasoned to me, but was tender and cooked just right. We also got the potato puree and the roasted cauliflower and broccoli. The puree was the mashed potatoes of my dreams. Get it. You won't be sorry. The roasted veggies I could live without. They do come with roasted garlic cloves though, which I love. Dessert was bomb. I have no more words. We got the mango & raspberry sorbet, the monkey bread for my birthday, the banana pudding and the fresh fruit. All delicious, you can't really go wrong. All in all, one if the best dining experiences I've ever had.",

The dishes are presented very well in a skillet and the presentation brings immediate delight to the visual senses.  Maybe it's us or maybe it's not but the steaks, Filet Mignon & Bone-in Rib Eye did not taste anything special. The meats were tough to bite into and the expectations of it melting in our mouth led to a disappointment. The steaks were too dry in my opinion.  The side dishes, on the other hand, were great. The Brussels Sprouts and Potatoes were so good that we finished eating them before we finished the steaks.  I think the restaurant may need a renovation project to bring its ambiance back to modern steakhouses in the area. The service was slow however I must mention that the restaurant was busy.",

We were grinning from ear to ear, that was after we closed our eyes and tilted our heads back to enjoy each fatty burst of marbled goodness.    The A5 filet was really great also, but didn't have the same visceral reaction.    Skip the willamette and go with the CA Pinot noir.   Go for the lobster salad and seasonal greens, bright and light to start your meal.  I would say lighter on the butter for the mushrooms next round.   End with the monkey bread.    Fantastic memorable meal.  Consistently sets the bar for steaks in Vegas.",

    "text": "Last year, I experienced Craft Steak for the first time and was blown away.  For months, friends had to bear with me as I repeatedly bragged that my meal there was the best dinner of my life.  I wasn't exaggerating either, as everything from my pineapple upside-down martini, to the pretzel bread with dipping mustards was unbelievably delicious.  As far as my steak was concerned, I honestly had never enjoyed the act of chewing meat as much as I did at Craft Steak, last December.  Finally back in Vegas, it's not surprising that the first restaurant I visited was Craft Steak.  Like a druggie trying to recapture that first high, I hoped for that same magic once again.  Well?  Don't get me wrong, Craft Steak is a top notch restaurant, but even a great spot can have an off night.  Unfortunately, the off night happened to be the night I had looked so forward to. What happened?  When tonight's steak arrived, I noticed something was wrong from the start as it was a bit tough and took more effort to cut than one would hope for from a $50 piece of meat.  Not only that, but that first chew revealed the steak to be cold.  Sadly, and embarrassingly, I had to send it back.  When I let my server know the situation, she was very willing to accommodate me by having a second steak prepared, but, in the interim, the potatoes and spinach we ordered as sides just sat, as they too, waited.    Finally, my replacement steak arrived, but by that point, my companion had already finished her entree, AND our side dishes had become cold, so basically, I paid $200 to NOT receive a warm plate of food, nor the opportunity to dine with my wife.  Don't get me wrong; I have nothing but respect for Tom Colicchio and I know Craft Steak is a fine restaurant, but tonight I merely ate, when I wanted to dine.",

    "text": "CraftSteak absolutely lived up to its name and what you would expect.  The Steaks (yes we all had more than one) were perfect and exactly what you would expect from a high end steak house.  While the atmosphere, I feel, could be better and more sophisticated for this level of service and quality steak, it is still nice.  The only part I thought twice about where the plastic place mats at each setting (can we say 50's diner).   For food we opted for the prefix steak meal ($130pp) and I can honestly say this was one of the few times it was definitely worth it.  The amount of food you get with this meal is outstanding.  Course 1 is pretty much every side and salad they have on the menu.  You get them all and in quantities that are enough for each person.  Course 2 is your steak, also served with additional sides and veggies.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and again you get to try 6 different cuts of meat (filet, ribeye, new york, etc.).  Course 3 is dessert and again you get all of their signature desserts.  A delicious way to end a feast and considering the price you would ultimately pay for a salad, steak and dessert ($100 + pp), the prefix definitely makes sense.  Highly recommend!  I will be heading back to craft the next time I need a good steak!",

    "text": "After dining here, my husband and I decided that we will never, ever eat a fancy Vegas restaurant.  The service was spotty and the food was good, but definitely not good enough to justify the price.  WAY overhyped and expensive.  After living in the bay area for a few months, we know what good, quality food should be like and how much it should cost.  I can't remember exactly how much each item was (not listed on their online menu), but let's just say that we ate 9 courses combined with 2 wine pairings at Gary Danko in SF for the same price.  I'm usually a bread FIEND, but I was not into their bread at all.  It didn't taste like much even with butter.  We started out with their lobster bisque and it was good, but I know I can find better for cheaper in SF.  For our entrees, we ordered the shortrib and scallops.  The shortribs came out in a little pot still in its juices, so it stayed moist and flavorful and the scallops were average.  So, for the sides, we didn't realize that they were meant to be shared, but we had leftovers for a midnight snack.  I would think our waiter would've told us the portion size when we ordered the braised kale, potato gratin, baby spinach, and baby shiitake mushrooms just for ourselves, but oh well.  All the sides except the spinach were delicious.  Spinach was good too, but I'm sure it would've been better with bacon.  Ha.  Overall....................... seriously not worth it!",

    "text": "If you can't afford a $300+ meal(for two) you should probably just stop reading this review now. It will only make you sad to know that you can't enjoy it.   This most recent trip to Vegas was my first time as an \"Adult\" meaning I wasn't a drunk, poor college student trying to get by on $50 a day(for food). So, obviously I wanted to go big.   And boy did we go big. This was the most food I got in Vegas, and I went to two different Buffets too. Most importantly though, the food was amazing.   This was a 5 star dining experience from start to finish. We had made a reservation and arrived early to grab a cocktail at the bar. The cocktails we both had were delicious. We showed up wearing fancy clothing, so the Hostess realized it was a special occasion(although, not really, I just like how my boyfriend looks in a tie) so we were given a private booth in the back of the restaurant. It was very quiet, and romantic.  We each ordered the Chef's 3 course meal(must have at least 2 people). We went with the American Wagyu for $140 each. And it was worth every penny. We started off with an appetizer, we had the Hand-cut Wagyu Tartare which was delicious. I have never had tartare before, and we both loved it. We also got our choice of 3 of the salad choices. We had the Italian Buffalo Mozzarella, Roasted Red Peppers and the Wild Arugula. They were all fantastic, but I think the Buffalo Mozzarella was my favorite(which included a roasted red pepper relish, which was fantastic).   Then came the steaks. Oh man, the steaks. We both got the American Wagyu which comes from Snake River Farms in Idaho. I had the New York Strip and my boyfriend had the Rib eye. They were cooked perfectly and so, so delicious. Each cut was 14 oz, and I couldn't even finish it. I felt weird leaving behind delicious, expensive steak.   With our steak we also got our choice of 3 sides. We had the Mushroom Assortment, Potato Gratin and White Corn Grits  with Bacon, Gruyere, Chives. They were all good, but once again we had a favorite: White Corn Grits. We polished these off. The addition of the bacon and Gruyere was amazing.   After eating ALL OF THE FOOD. We also got a tasting selection of desserts including the Cinnamon Monkey Bread, Vanilla Cheesecake, Farmers Market Fruit and ice cream and sorbet. At this point we could barely even touch the food, but it was all very tasty. Our favorite was the Monkey Bread(which we surprisingly somehow managed to finish, probably because it was delicious, but also because we are fatties).   Overall, I think the Chef's 3 course meal is the way to go. The Steak by itself was $105, for $35 more we got ALL THE FOOD.   We also shared a bottle of Malbec, which is always my favorite with Steak. They have a very extensive wine list.   The service was all top notch, and wonderful.   It was a delicious dinner and a fantastic experience.",

The meat was so tender and the flavor made me moan with each bite. We had the potatoes gratin and Brussels Sprouts for sides.  I recommend both of them.   I wanted to eat the entire tray of fresh baked rolls,  but I resisted the temptation.  I did take them home and had them the next day. For dessert, the bf ordered the Monkey Bread.  While it was delicious, he said mine is better.  ha!   The bill was around $200 (we weren't drinking that night), so be prepared to spend some money.  But this is Vegas and you don't eat like that every day.",

He made suggestions that assured that we did not order too much food, spending more than we needed to.  Our water glasses were never below the halfway mark, and the young man filling them was so very polite. This is not a restaurant where you would go for a casual night out; it is pretty expensive.

He said his steak was good. Mine was good, cooked to my liking Shared green beans and fingerling potatoes. They were really good. We left stuffed, was bummed didn't get dessert. Oh and side note, I loved that the waitress made my meal dairy free when I told her I was lactose intolerant.  Overall, It was a great experience.

We ended up going with the tasting menu, which ended up being way more food than we should have ate. The highlights of our menu included the Warm Frisee Salad, my New York Strip Steak, the cauliflower, and the Monkey Bread. All together, the 1 appetizer, 3 salads, two steaks, and four desserts were delicious.  Bill ended up being just a little under $500 with a bottle of wine and tip -- more expensive than we're used to paying for dinner (expensive for us is usually $200), but for a one time dining experience, it was worth it.  The service was amazing with all of the staff being extremely welcoming. The bartenders in the lounge chatted up my fiance about some record being broken in the Detroit Lions game, then our waiter joked around with us about our upcoming wedding. My fiance also requested to get an appetizer that wasn't included in the tasting menu, the scallops, which our waiter accommodated.",

We didn't mind, but when we got there at our reservation time, we had to wait another 30 minutes for a table.  I understand that we were in Vegas and at a popular restaurant, but why bother to make a reservation at all?  Once we got seated, it took more than 10 minutes for our server to arrive.  It seemed like he wanted to be somewhere else - he never smiled, never came back to see if we were happy with our food, and never asked if we wanted to refill our drinks.  That being said, we all agreed the meal itself was quite good.  They begin by bringing a small \"loaf\" of tiny buns sprinkled with sea salt.  I didn't have any, but it must have been good because my two dining companions had the busboy bring us a second serving.  For dinner, I had the tuna but asked for it to be cooked, not just seared. It was really good, but I still could have been cooked longer for my taste.  My friends had the short ribs and the salmon, and both loved their meals.   I highly recommend the food here, but the disorganization and bad service may not make up for the meal.",

We didn't really care for it then, but decided to give it another shot.  I ordered the Filet & she ordered the Salmon.  The table split a bunch of side dishes; Fries, Creamy Potatoes, Spinach, Mushroom & Peas Risotto, Asparagus, Potatoes Au Gratin.  My Filet was cooked to my liking, but it was underwhelming.  The flavor was good, but it was missing \"something\"....it didn't make me want more.  Wifey enjoyed her Salmon, but said it wasn't great.  The sides were underwhelming too....the Potatoes Au Gratin were very runny, the highlight was the Fries.  I split a Buffalo Mozzarella Salad with a friend of mine for an Appetizer & it was too soft & runny for my tastes.  The best part about dinner was the wine.  We had a Magnum of 2005 Faust Cabernet Sauvignon, which was excellent!  It had a nice bold flavor and had hints of Blackberry & a slight peppery taste to it.  It went well with the steak.  Overall, the experience was underwhelming.  Certainly not worth the $355 for Wifey & I.  We've had much better dinners for much less.  Will we return?  Unless someone else pays for it, probably not.",

    "text": "Great food, decent service, and downer of ambiance is the only way of describing Craftsteak. Almost everything we ordered was amazing. The mood of the restaurant was a downer on the night that we went. No subtle mood music, in fact, I was more aware of the staffs conversations then what was going on with my party.  Onto the positives! The Kumamoto oysters are ordered individually and were delicious. They come with the traditional mignonette, horseradish, lemon, and cocktail sauce. The steak tartare is a staple for my group now. We are trying to find the best in Vegas. Tom Colicchio has a solid one, but not the best. The flavor components are sound, but something more impressive than a plain crostini is needed. The stand out appetizer was the warm friscee salad with blue cheese vin and a poached egg. All very simple ingredients that combine to make magic. Once the salad is tossed and the egg broken, it adds another dimension to the dish. I have never been more dissatisfied with dining family style. I wanted it all to myself.  Moving on to the 8oz of Australian wagyu. It is seriously butter. It melts in your mouth and makes you go limp. At a hefty price tag, it is still worth it. The filet and New York strip were delicious, but pale in comparison to the wagyu. The rack of lamb comes in four pieces and marbled to perfection. No need for forks and knives, they are to be treated as lollipops once my party got to them. The diver scallops are tender and the fennel salad compliments them so well. The yukon gold mashed potato is what everyone raves about. Are they good? Hell yes, please keep dishing it out. The assorted mushrooms are rather dreamy as well. The Maui onions could keep on coming.  The one downer were the grits. They sounded awesome but fell short.   All in all with two bottles of wine and split between 5 it still comes out to a hefty price tag. It is just hard to put too much emphasis on money when the food is of this standard.",

I did have a piece of my friends ribeye and that was amazing as well!  When I go back, I'm definitely getting the ribeye AND the lobster.  We ordered a bunch of sides and shared it as we had 9 people total.  Lastly, the service.  Holy cow was the service above and beyond!

We all did the restaurant week menu.  AND IT WAS AS GREAT AS I REMEMBERED!  The three course menu has been well-described by other reviewers.  I will just say that I am a huge fan of Tom Colicchio's style of cooking: simple and awesome.  He understands that good food doesn't require foie gras or a bunch of fancy crap.  I would recommend this place to anyone who likes unpretentious, excellent food.    It's definitely worth mentioning that the service was impeccable.  The server's assistant even gave us pens and magnets and told us about the episode of Top Chef that was filmed in the restaurant with Natalie Portman.  Yes, I'm a huge dork! haha.  Love that show.  This was a wonderful dining experience.   They even managed to squeeze us in on the last day of restaurant week.",

Our server talked thru the multiple appetizer options with us -- trying to get a feel for what we liked vs. didn't and thru conversation our server knew what he was going to recommend and order on our behalf.  Then we discussed steak cuts, sides and desserts.  Appetizers - Shrimp cocktail / Prosciutto San Daniele w/fresh figs / Caesar Salad w/Anchovy on side / Italian Buffalo Mozzarella w/roasted red peppers and toasted hazelnuts --- all these items were presented and set in the middle of us -- each of these were servings enough for 4 people;  if you loved shrimp and nothing else, perhaps 2 shrimp would be in order if you could talk one of your dining partners into giving up theirs.  This was very similar to a small plates experience of sharing and conversation.  Next was the steaks - New York Strip / Ribeye / Skirt Steak / Filet Mignon -- now my daughter would have originally preferred to order a Filet all to herself, but she went along with this WAGYU dining experience and as each beautifully charred and sliced steak was placed in the middle of the table, she tried each of the cuts and declared that she couldn't choose which was her favorite.  This is a girl who orders nothing but Filets!    The sides chosen were Asparagus (daughter loves) / Potato Puree / Mushroom assortment -- again these were in serving dishes portioned for 4 to share.  I had my way with the mushroom assortment as it turned out nobody else was really interested in them.  Now on to the desserts.... Monkey bread / sorbets n icecream / chocolate molten something / chocolate torte w/chocolate gelato / pane cotta w/raspberry sorbet  A wonderful and memorable dining experience!",

    "text": "I  visit Vegs primarily for the eating extravaganzas and the buffset, but maybe in between, I just might throw in a visit to Craftsteak.  I mean hey If you've won a notable amount of dirty cash and you're looking for a worthy meal to splurge on, this is where you absolutely must go.   It is recommended that reservations are made, unless you like to spend a lot of time people watching in the casino.  The setup/ambiance is very contemporary, but not ostentatiously  trendy. The strategically dimmed lighting seems to bring out your dinner mates' best features, and possibly hides a bit of that post meal pouch you'll be harboring later on.   Started off with the mozzarella caprese salad. It seems simple enough but I think it was prepared very well, or it could have been the presentation. In any event,  this already got my mouth watering for my second course, the rib eye cooked bloody rare. Holllly! Bite after bite and I could barely contain my tummy fairies from playing their golden harps around me.  It was just that f@cking good. The hangar steak and filet mignon were just as good, but I fancy the slight buttery marble in my prime rib.  Got the mushroom risotto as a side and there I was, yet again, trying to contain my excitement over excellent meal. This was by far, the best risotto I have ever spooned into my greedy little mouth. Everything was so masterfully prepared, I can't even express that enough without sounding redundant.  I really wish I had room for dessert because my eyes ooogled as I saw goodies passing by me to and fro, but sadly, I was defeated! Sigh.   Either way, I was in awe over and over again as each food item crossed my lips....  Oh and service was stellar.   A typical 3 course meal will set you back about $90 with gratuity, oh it ain't cheap, but it's sooooooooooooooo worth it. I can't wait for the tummy fairies to sing their tunes to me again......",

One of Tom Colicchio's feature restaurants doesn't simply aspire to make great food. They start the diner off with an extensive wine, whiskey, beer and alcohol menu. Although very few wines find themselves south of $100 a bottle, a few great buys can be found to complement the meal. And if you are a scotch, bourbon, whiskey kinda guy (or gal), the list is almost too exhausting to review.   As far as the food, in one word, decadent. From the charcuterie plate that could be a meal in and of itself to the whipped potatoes that seemingly have as much butter/cream as potato (in a good way) to the baby carrots drizzled in local honey to the steaks (all phenomenal, but we split the Wagyu Flat Iron), the group enjoyed every bite. Add a finishing layer of monkey bread, a cinnamon roll on steroids with velvety scoops of ice cream, and you may just need to retire early instead of testing your skills in the casino.",

    "text": "Each time i visit a new city, one of the first things that i check is if one of my favourite contestants from Top Chef has opened up a restaurant in that particular city.  Well, i thought it was about time to switch our focus from contestants to judges.  I will admit that when i first started watching Top Chef, i had never heard of Tom Colicchio, i blame part of it on being Canadian.  So on our recent trip to Vegas we made sure to make a reservation at Craftsteak.  We walked from the Trump hotel, and really underestimated how long the walk would take.  We were about 10 minutes late, but luckily and surprising the restaurant was behind schedule.  We ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes to be seated.  Upon walking into the restaurant it was grand, and the sheer size was impressive.  Our server shortly came over and we both placed a drink order for a pomegranate martini.  The drink had pomegranate, lime and tequila.  The drink wasn't memorable, it was very straightforward, i was expecting something different for $15.  I did appreciate though how each drink came in a mini shaker and was poured tableside.  For our mains, we both ordered a steak (sorry i dont remeber the cut), and 2 sides per person.  I had the sunchokes, and shiitakes, and my sis had the fingerling potatoes, and mushrooms.  We debated about how many sides we should order, they averaged about $15 each, i would've preferred one each but i was expecting the portion size to be miniscule.  This is my issue, a server works at a restaurant day in and day out, they are experts, and when we ordered our mains and four sides, he should have stepped in and and be honest and say that that would be enough for two linebackers, not too young ladies.  I have read Waiter Rant, i know that servers drive up the bill for a bigger tip, but if he was straight forward and suggested something lighter, for a similar price, i would have respected him.  Our food arrived to the table and the steak look great, but the only thing that i could look at were the sides, and how i just wasted so much of my hard earned money on food i knew that i couldn't finish.  Each side was good but at the end of the day it was roasted in fat, and served, that was it, it was very basic.  I was unimpressed with the entire concept of the restaurant.  I know that it is a steakhouse, so you order your meat and sides, but the whole meal was disjointed, it was simply meat, mushrooms, and starch.  I wish that there was a sauce to bring the entire meal together.  I wanted to eat at Toms and get his vision, i didn't get it, i was so disappointed. Overall, i am going to use a line of Toms that i recently heard him recite on Top Chef, \"you go to a restaurant for the food, and you return for the service\", unfortunately i wont be going back for either.",

The meat is fall-apart tender, and the au jus has the most amazing flavor. The bartender told me the secret to making them even better (I wasn't sure this was possible!) was to take the rolls that were served with dinner - split them in half & put the shredded meat on there to make mini-sliders. I don't know how it was possible to make it even better, but it did!! Insanely good. The bartender offered to do a small/half portion of one of the sides for me, and even the small portion was very generous. I will be dreaming of these shortribs until my next visit! YUM.",

Yelp is my go to, but I guess it's still a crapshoot. I took a very good friend to dinner who craved a quality steak. We both ordered the ribeye which was 60$, and that's just for the steak. I don't mind paying for quality, but I've had better steaks at Outback. My steak was all gristle and fat. I asked for a medium well and received a steak that was red on inside and black on outside. The meat  was tough. \"It still had marks from where the jockey was hitting it\" My friend ordered a medium and it was well done. I was extremely disappointed. I can't believe the Mirage closed Kokomos in favor of this place. Maybe mine was an isolated incident, but it was terrible. Also, the hostess and waitress need to work on their customer service skills. No smiles and basically handed me my silverware and brought out the food. There was no briefing on recomnendation of their menu and didn't even ask us how our meal was. They are lucky they didn't! The Mirage has lost it's luster. There were prostitutes all over the place and the dealers are just going through the motions....no smiles, no banter, nothing. Do yourself a favor and head over to the Linq across the street. Mirage you have been warned....get your act together. You have lost a 20 yr customer.",

It was definitely good overall, but for the price point ($225 dinner for 2), and the Chef's awards, I expected a lot more--perfection, or darn close to it!  The appetizers of shrimp and oysters were fantastic.  The big problem for me was the Caesar salad.  It was warm, slightly wilted like warm lettuce is want to do, and just pretty lousy in flavor.  I've had better Caesar salads at inexpensive chain restaurants.  I was also disappointed the staff did not notice or remark that neither of us ate the salad.  A whole entree sent back to the kitchen unnoticed.  The steaks were cooked to perfection and we very much enjoyed the butternut squash risotto.  We did not get dessert because the choices were less than stellar for gluten free options.  Overall, the food was good, but minus one star for inedible Caesar salad, and minus one star for no gluten free dessert options (sorbet and strange flavored ice cream does not count).

We also ordered sides of the potato puree and assorted mushrooms.  I was pleasantly surprised at how tender and flavorful the t-bone was, and the rest of the table agreed. The duck portion was rather large, but the skin was not crispy and the cherries that accompanied the dish were too tart. Although the most impressive looking in size, the porterhouse was not tender, even though it looked it and was cooked medium rare. It also came with a bearnaise sauce that seemed a little too acidic and really didn't enhance the flavor of the steak.   The potato puree was absolutely delicious - you can tell they put a lot of cream, butter and love into it. The assorted mushrooms were also very good and were a good compliment to the steaks.  Our server, Kevin, was really friendly and gave us lots of options in order to get more bang for our buck in terms of amount of food for our group to share. But we knew our limits and I'm glad we didn't order too much because we still had leftovers.   I didn't get to try the bread because I didn't want to fill up, but my friends said it was good and we got some to go and had it for breakfast the next day.   I don't want to say the service was slow, but I did feel we waited awhile after we were done eating in order to get our food packed up and get our bill paid. But the overall service was amazing - they constantly filled our water glasses and various employees would stop by to ask if we needed anything. Not a bad steakhouse, but there are definitely better ones in Vegas.",

Next time, we will focus more on the appetizers and less on the main course... By the way, their wine and booze menu is over the top. There is a serious Single-Malt selection my friend!

    "text": "What could have been a disaster turned into a great experience. My wife and I had booked a show that evening that started at 10:30 and we decided to go to Craftsteak beforehand. We had cocktails and then ordered a bottle of wine and ordered appetizers and main courses. The wine arrived before the food and we sat chatting and sipping our wine and I realized it had been 45 minutes since we ordered and no food was on the table yet. We got caught up in conversation and didn't realize it had been so long and then I realized we had finished more than half of our wine. I grabbed a manager and asked for our waiter and also asked what was taking so long. He left and our waiter came back and looked like he had seen a ghost. He obviously forgot to put our order in. He ran into the kitchen and about 5 minutes later ran back out and said we'll get it out as soon as possible. The manager came back by about 10 minutes later with some sort of vegetable plate and said that this should hold us over until our food comes and at that point my wife jumped in to voice her concern about the fact that we now ran the risk of missing our show and let him know how disappointed we were in their service so far, as now we were almost an hour and a half into this ordeal. His rude response was \"Well bottom line is your food's on the way\" and just turned and walked away.  We looked at each other and both repeated his ridiculous bottom line comment and I flagged down the waiter and asked for a check for the drinks and wine and told him I thought his manager was a jerk. At that point another manager, older tall gentleman, came by and whispered something to the waiter. The waiter ran into the kitchen and came out with another bottle of wine and several other waiters carrying our food. I said that I didn't order that wine and he then said it's fine and poured us two glasses and left us to eat. We had to rush through the dinner and I asked for a check right away as we really had about 15 minutes to get to the show. he said \"oh no you can't leave yet, we called over to the theater (The show was right at the MGM) and let them know not to start without you. Right then every desert on the menu was put on the table in front of us along with coffee and Cognac!! When I got the bill I realized they didn't charge us for the second bottle of wine and of course the deserts were all comped, and gave us a percentage off of the bill so basically we paid for entrees only! Nice save!! We all screw up as we are all human, but how many businesses go to this extent to fix a screw up and make an everlasting impression on their customers? I've been back to Craftsteak several times since and I've told this story and sung their praises many times.",

    "text": "The food here is high quality. Our favorite thing surprisingly wasn't the steak, but the scallops. The outside was seared to perfection, while the inside was nice and tender.  They also have delicious mussels, bathing in a yummy broth.    One issue we had was initially they sat us at a table right in the front, completely exposing us to the drunks walking around the hotel. This might appeal to some; however my husband and I were looking to enjoy a romantic evening alone. We asked to move and thankfully got seated in a more secluded location, providing the intimate experience we sought.    The service was a little on the weak side. Much of the time we were waiting on our server instead of him waiting on us.  I don't know that we'd return, but we had a nice time.",

We ordered the bone-in ribeye and it was chain grocery store quality at best.  You know how lower grade meat has that mealy texture?  We ordered it medium rare and it was still that way.  We were really disappointed because the last time we were here it was a delicious experience.  Maybe their purveyors are pulling a fast one on them.  To be fair, we are used to prime steakhouses and this wasn't listed as prime...but we still didn't expect it to be as low in quality as it was.",

Since the event is at MGM Grand Garden Arena, decided to get a quick bite  at craftsteak before the party began lol   We didn't make a reservation so only be able to sit at their bar area which is perfect for our quick dinner.   Their lobster bisque is really good with chuck of lobster in there. Ordered the foie gras(good), wagyu ribeye, new york strip, potato gratin and hen of the woods. It's just an ok steak!!! Definitely think CUT has a better steak! But love the foie gras!!!!:) as I'm not able to eat that at CA anymore...  Overall, nice ambience, ok food  But when I ordered my second cocktail, there is a fly inside my drink!!! I let the server knew but she didn't even apologize and just walked away with the drink. I really think the service is horrible in a so called fine dining restaurant!!!!! She came back with a new drink without even said anything. I felt the server is so rude...  Honestly, I think it's just a fair steakhouse. The best food they can offer is their bread!  I really love the bread!",

    "text": "let's begin by clarifying that I don't give out 5 stars haphazardly. It's gotta be special. Craft was, indeed, special. I had the task of trying to find somewhere for a business/client dinner after a conference day. We decided on steak, so I looked for steakhouses in Vegas. Of course I love Tom Colicchio, so I figured Craftsteak had to be a good bet, coupled with other Yelp reviews, I made my choice. From calling to set up the reservation for 11, to arriving and being greeted, seated, and served, the entire experience was fantastic. I was not disappointed in one single thing. The 11 of us opted to order separate entrees and a bevvy of sides to share. I'll get to that in a minute. First, I want to comment on the Dark and Stormy that I ordered. One of my favorite drinks, a close second to the Moscow Mule, this one was hands down one of the best drinks I've ever had. Try it, prove me wrong. As far as food, I ordered a fresh mozzarella with tomato and balsamic reduction appetizer, and it was creamy, fresh and delicious.  I also wanted to try the famed Hangar steak after hearing a co-worker rave about it. It was every bit as good as he made it out to be. Tender, yet packed full of flavor. Not too fatty, but not too lean. I could have cut it with a fork, and I'd order it again if I ever get the opportunity. The sides I tried, from the french fries to the grits to the sunchokes, were all super. After dinner, we of course had to have dessert. I opted for the tropical sorbet, and the mix of passion fruit and mango was so flavorful, I didn't want to share it. I also tried the monkey bread, amazing as well. Bottom line. Worth it. Worth every penny. If you love meat, and you get the opportunity, don't pass this one up.",

    "text": "Hubby and I wanted a yummy bite to eat before seeing Ka at the MGM Grand - well this was definitely the place to go.  We have been fans of Tom Colicchio for years and have always wanted to eat at one of his restaurants and we were dying to eat here.  Only problem?  We had about 30 minutes to drink, eat and run to make our show in time.  Our waitress was up to the challenge...  She recommended a few items that she knew could come out quickly -  Wagyu Tartar, potato puree and the short rib.  Our martini's came out and were delish as was the Wagyu tartar.  They then brought out this piping hot set of dinner rolls with a beautiful salted top and fresh butter.  It was like crack -- hot, delish with the melted butter.  I'd like some now, please.  She then brought out the mashed potatoes and the shortribs, which were fall off the bone perfect.  Their sauce was amazing and complimented the buttery mashed potatoes.  Those potatoes were so good, I wanted to slather them all over myself when I tasted them but then thought I'd really ruin the pretty dress I had on...  To say they were buttered would be an understatement -- they are probably close to 50% butter to potato ratio but they were well worth blowing the diet.  We got out of there extremely satisfied and in under 30 minutes.  I've already got my eyes set on another trip to Vegas in early 2013 and I'm going to make sure we get a full, unrushed dinner here.",

    "text": "So I was a bit torn about whether to give this restaurant 4* or 5* cause I didn't like it as much as my husband, but I don't like steak as much as him, so I have to go the trusty 4.5* rounded up to 5*.  Now, even though it was 5* and a great restaurant, there were some definite pluses and minuses.  First pluses:  AMAZING steak tartare - this was SOOOOOOOOO good!   Wagyu skirt steak - really tender and tasty Potato gratin - perfectly cooked, but I wish it had a bit more cheese and a little less cream  The minuses: Service was a little spotty. It was weird not to have bread plates (the bread, btw, was very tasty, but not OMG AMAZING) I just expected a little more from the steak  That being said, if you like steak and you want a good steak, come here!  Things were cooked perfectly and everything was really tasty!  You will not be disappointed in the quality of the steak.  Oh, and we ordered 1 appetizer, 2 glasses wine, 2 steaks, 1 side, and 1 dessert for us and we were pretty full!  So if we would have done the tasting, we would have DIED!  Ordering a la carte really shouldn't be a problem :)",

If this had been \"Restaurant Wars,\" I don't know if we'd see Tom advance to the next round...  When we approached the hostess desk, four hostesses/servers were present and not one greeted us until about three minutes had passed.   I had the lobster bisque and found it overwhelmingly over seasoned with cinnamon. It tasted more like cake batter than bisque.   Next, I had the arugula salad with lemon vinaigrette. They actually refused to add tomatoes to it! For the first time in my life I had to send food back to the kitchen. The taste of lemon was so intense, I felt like I was biting directly into one with each bite. I couldn't muster the courage to finish the dish.   The risotto that we had as a side had a taste that reminded me Betty Crocker Instant scalloped potatoes. It was sticky and undercooked.   I must say, the service was wonderful; very attentive and friendly. Other dishes that we got (scallops, Wagyu tartare, and hangar steak) were delicious.   Overall, a disappointment. I still love Tom though.",

Then we shared the diver scallops for our appetizer. They were jumbo sized and cooked perfectly in a light sauce with lemon and fennel.   For our entrees we shared a rib-eye steak and shortribs. The rib-eye was a huge portion. It was enough that we could have split that alone and been stuffed. I ordered it medium rare and it was spot on, really flavorful and tender. The shortrib was only okay, so I wouldn't order it again. Comparatively the steak was much better. For sides we split the potato puree and the corn grits. Again, huge portions! The potato puree was really smooth and a great complement to the steak. The grits were tasty but pretty heavy. I would only get 2 sides again if I was there with 3 or 4 people. We were beyond full and had to leave a good amount of food on our plates.  When the check came we expressed how full we were to the waitress and she said next time we could totally share an entree. Score! Next time I'll save some money and have enough room for dessert! I love that they are an uber fancy restaurant but don't mind people sharing.",

The service and atmosphere were great, although we all thought the cartoony cow pictures on the wall were a little unsettling.  We were able to try a lot of things being in such a big group, which definitely added to the experience. The rolls we were initially served look incredible and tasted almost as good as they looked.   As for sides, the Shiitake mushrooms and whipped potatoes were both mediocre and the fingerlings were bland. The potato gratin was delicious and creamy, and the broccoli was superb with unique seasoning.   All of the steaks I tried were superb. I had the Wagyu skirt steak (a suggestion from the server), which was incredibly tender, moist, and flavorful. I wouldn't put these in the top steaks I've ever tried, but they were close to reaching that bracket.  For dessert, a couple of us shared the monkeybread, which was like a cinnamon bread pudding served with ice cream. It was spectacular--probably the biggest wow of the night. Save room for this dessert!",

Such as the best rolls, steak, and sides that we have ever tasted and for that reason we made a special trip back to Vegas just to eat at this restaurant.  However, this time it was a completely different experience, where everything was over salted (not over seasoned, but way too much salt on everything).  It was almost not edible as well as the temperature on the steak was way off.  I ordered a medium rare steak, but a large portion of my steak was medium (making it a tough chew).  These are issues that one may expect to run into every once in a while in a single $ restaurant, but not at $$$$ establishment like Craftsteak.  Needless to say, we are very disappointed and will not be back.  As a side note: there were no issues with the staff, everyone was friendly and helpful.  However less can be said about the chef that cooked our meal.",

Enough food for 3 people, appetizers, main course and desserts.  Yes all three courses come with more than just one dish.  Wow!!   The corn is like crack, I had to get the recipe.  Don't miss out, make your reservations and forget about the prices!!",

    "text": "I was staying at the MGM so it was quite convenient to have this restaurant downstairs.  The atmosphere was quite comfortable sitting at table in the bar area.  The wine list was broad enough that I was able to find \"reasonable\" priced selections that worked well.  We split a lobster to start. It was supposed to be 2.5 lbs and maybe it was but out of the shell it was a few choice bites for each. The Kumamoto oysters were divine.  Kept it simple with the dry aged strip that was super tasty yet slightly cooked past my medium rare request. The mushrooms were a very interesting assortment so we got a mix of all of them.   All in all everything was good to very good. The service was spot on and being so convenient in my hotel a short walk to the elevator made for a pleasant dinner.",

The Wagyu New York Strip was the best tasting piece steak, outside of some Kobe I had while over in Japan,  that I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The $35 wine pairings were also a great deal to go with the meal.  We tried the inclusive wagyu surf and turf meal for 3, so we tried multiple different cuts and sides alongside the items I am recommending above.  4 stars for the other items that came with the surf & turf meal.  5 stars for the wait staff, the bisque, the wagyu strip steak, and the wine pairings.",

    "text": "NOTHING will top a steakhouse experience like this one. In-credible.   It's located in the MGM hotel.  Reservations are a must - don't try to badger your way in like the rude 6 guys we spotted on our visit. They were obnoxious to the hostess and then threw her under the bus when the GM arrived. Just be respectful and make reservations.   You can order a la carte as with any steakhouse OR do as the best patrons do and do \"Chef's Selection.\" You select how many courses you want, pay a set fee per head and relinquish all control to the chef. It is AMAZING. You don't know what you don't know and you don't get to choose...CHEF's SELECTION. :) Oh, and you have a staff of three catering to you.   Everyone started out with Lobster Bisque. Staple starter.  We were blessed with 3 different salads, 2 Kobe beef steaks as entrees, 3 side dishes and 3 desserts.  Yes, it sounds like a ton of food but it's gourmet. This isn't southern cooking. Everything is small in portion size enough to share and it's supposed to be appreciated and savored. I can see what we ate but can't remember the names. Regardless - it was all AMAZING.  The desserts were outstanding. We had a bottle of chardonnay as well.    Bottom line, just do it. Let go of the control. Enjoy the ambiance. Enjoy the attention from a very polished staff across the board. The prices are not inexpensive but you TOTALLY get what you pay for and them some....it was an indescribable experience. Plus, my sweetheart put this whole experience together for me. I was in heaven!",

We didn't go all out with the course meals, instead we ordered filet mignon, new york strip, the mushroom assortment, and the potato puree.  Also got a bottle of wine to go with it.    Everything was good.  I ordered my filet medium rare.  Only the center was really medium rare, a good 3/4 inch around the edges were more medium to well done which I didn't like as much but it was very tasty.   I really liked the mushroom assortment - lot of butter but it was unique and I liked the different mushrooms they had.  The potato puree comes - it's literally a pot of mashed potatoes.  Fatty but delicious- the pot was quite big.  Overall I liked it, and it was convenient as we were staying @ the Signature.",

The hostess did inform us that it would take roughly an hour and a half to two hours to dine with them. She suggested we could eat at the bar to be assisted quicker. We took her suggestion, sat at the bar and was greeted by our server John. He was so kind and very helpful throughout our dining experience. My fiance had the filet mignon, which was so tender and wonderfully seasoned. I had the flat iron, which was excellent as well. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake. SO GOOD! The prices were reasonable for the amount of food you received. The atmosphere was slightly dull and not too busy, which is surprising for a Saturday night.",

    "text": "Went here on a Saturday night on July 4th weekend. Reservations were fairly easy to make. When we got there we were seated quickly. Water was served and they gave us iPad menus for drinks.   We actually got served by 4 waiters that night, there were different people checking up on us and we never had to ask for a thing. Everyone was really friendly, talkative and the staff was not overbearing. I asked a waiter where the bathroom was and he actually walked me to the corridor. I've never had that happen before!  The waiter suggested that we order the summer chefs tasting menu... The domestic wagu option was 155 per person. This was really pricey but he said it came with appetizers, Meats, sides and dessert. He said it was a really good deal and between the five of us, we should order 4 and it will be enough food to feed all of us ( it was me, and five hungry boys).   Since we ordered four tasting menus, we got 4 of each course. The appetizers were shrimp cocktail, frisee salad, Cesar salad, and prosciutto. Everything was really good!  The frisee salad was a little heavy on the blue cheese side, and the Cesar salad could have had a little more dressing but the prosciutto and shrimp were delicious!!  For the meats, we had the Ribeye, filet mignon, hanger steak and ny strip. The meats were cooked to a perfect medium rare. I actually liked that they cut it up for us because it was easier to share. I also liked the variety because you don't get tired of one cut, or one texture. The hanger steak was actually my favorite!!  It was juicy, salty and meaty. The sides that came were asparagus, mushroom medley, mushroom risotto and pureed potatoes. I loved all the sides!  They added nice flavor profiles and a change of taste. The potatoes were extremely creamy and the mushrooms maintained their earthy taste and texture.   The five of us could barely finished. We were sooooooo stuffed  Finally came four desserts, sorbets of he day, banana bread pudding, chocolate mousse cake and panna cotta. Loved the bread pudding and panna cotta. The chocolate was super rich and dense. Not my favorite because I'm not a chocolate girl.   Overall it was a delicious meal with great friendly service. Be prepared to pay for a lot!!  We ordered coffee which was not included and that was not worth the price. But all and all a great experience!  If you go you should ask if you can choose the courses served. Because everything came and I'm not sure if it was a set menu or not. Also I'm not sure how it would be for two people. I think with more people you can taste a variety more and order less!",

We did the domestic waygu tasting menu @$155 per person (bill came to about $250 per person after drinks, tax and tip), which comprises of shrimp cocktail, 1 salad, 2 half salads (choose from menu; frisee salad was by far the best), choice of three Waygu beef and we did ny strip (best one by far), filet mignon, and ribeye. You also choose 3 sides and includes desserts.   What a feast. Way too much for 3 people but oh so good. Still my favorite steak house and fine dining place in Vegas (Aqua now called Michael Mina at Bellagio is a close second).   Maybe next time we (3 people) will just order 2 waygu ny strip ($108 each), frisee salad, cucumber/avocado salad, that divine potato puree, and split one dessert. Be $400 instead of $750.",

    "text": "Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak is located in MGM Grand and has a wonderful ambiance and atmosphere.   When were were seated (9:30 PM), the hostess asked if we had any shows they needed to be aware of. We told her we had a show at 11 PM. She stated she would tell our server.  First thing out was bread (complimentary) It was just a standard dinner roll made in house and served in a cask iron pan. It was soft and tasty. It had large sea salt sprinkled on top. It was served with a pat of butter. These were delicious.   As an appetizer, we got the Warm Frisee Salad to share - Frisee - Panchetta - Bleu Cheese - Vinegrette - Poached egg  This salad was only ok. It was overly dressed and needed to have a texture different. By half way through it was just soft and not very pleasing to eat. Neither of us (2) finished it.  By 10:15 PM we had not seen our entrees. We stopped another server to remind our server we had a show at 11 PM. They were prompt to bring out entrees  For our entrees My cousin chose the 10 oz. Hangar Black Angus  I chose the 16 oz. NY Strip  We shared the White Corn Grits - White corn meal - Prosciutto - Gruyere  My cousin's steak was decent. it was soft and tasty. It had a good mouth feel   My steak (which was pricier) was not cooked well. The steak had too much sinew and even with a nice steak knife, it was difficult to cut. It was over seasoned and wasn't anything too special. The center of the steak felt a little cold. Both steaks were served in a cast iron skillet. I wonder if this is a result of us needed to leave to see a show and they rushed to put out our entrees. Though we ordered within 10 minutes of being seated and the restaurant was at about 30% capacity.  The White Corn Grits were disappointing. I also felt like this was over seasoned. The prosciutto was about half a teaspoon of crumbled and it just didn't have anything to it. I think I would've preferred a simple mash over this side, or anything over this side. It did not complement the steak as a side dish at all and there wasn't much to it either.   Because time was close we didn't even have time to peruse over the dessert menu. Because we didn't finish our wine the server was kind enough to give us glasses we can carry to the show. This was a nice gesture.  Outside of dinner, the restroom left a bit to be desired. It looked like it hadn't been serviced in a while. 1 of 3 stalls didn't have toilet paper and the stall I chose was out of seat covers. They had cloth napkins instead of paper towels. It was abnormally dark in the restroom as well. Darker than the dining room. If you took the lighting in the dining room and comparing it to pitch black, I would say that the halfway point was the lighting in the restroom.  Final review: Food: left something to be desired Service: Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, polite. Overall atmosphere: nice, restroom needs more maintenance",

We were happy that they had a dress code, it adds to the experience and makes it seem special.  When we sat down we notice the man at the next table over was wearing a tee shirt, shorts and tennis shoes.  So much for the dress code.  It was time to order the wine, when we told the waiter that we don't drink wine he gave us a disgusted look.  We we ordered soft drinks he was quite annoyed.  The starters were wonderful.  I had shrimp and my wife and daughter had scallops.  The entree arrived and it was not as good as expected.  I ordered the bone in ribeye, medium rare.  The steak was a cinder on the outside, it literally crunched when you eat it.  It was tough, the knife had trouble cutting it.  My wife had the salmon, the skin was soggy.  She had to remove the skin in order to eat the fish.  I had expected to have a tremendous experience with wonderful food.  We didn't get either.",

    "text": "Went here since most other steak houses that Saturday night (LDW) was reserved for the dinnertime. The occasion was a friends birthday.   This restaurant is located in MGM and we valet because we were running a few minutes late. They do charge for both valet and self parking. We ended up paying $15 for the first 4 hrs.   Though we were a few minutes late it was like 5 minutes or so before we got seated. The ambiance in the restaurant is nice with low lighting.   My group ordered the:  Ribeye Hanger steak Lobster salad  Filet mignon  Grilled corn side  All meat dishes were cooked medium rare  The ribeye and hanger steak were beautifully cooked. Delicious flavor to it and a good balance of meat and fat. I would definitely recommend these two.   The lobster salad was lobster served in the shell of half a lobster on a bed of ice with a pile of seaweed. Which wasn't what I expected. I was hoping it was an actual salad. Especially since what I originally was trying to order was a lobster bisque underneath the salad section but it was in fact a soup (don't get why it was there, but the idea would have sounded delicious if it was a salad) and the server suggested the lobster salad instead. TBH not hat impressed with it for the price.   The filet mignon was good but pale in comparison to the other two meat dishes. It was tender but plain. Unless that's how filet mignon is normally served I kind of wish it was a bit seasoned-even with salt and pepper *shrug  I saved the best for last. As other posts may have mentioned their grilled corn side (don't remember he actual name but it is the only corn side) was BOMB. It has onions in it and cilantro(if I remember correctly) and I must say I can order that and just eat it on its own. Would highly highly recommend this side.",

    "text": "BF surprised me with reservations here for date night! Definitely a place that would be a hit with guys, it's a steak and potatoes place for sure. The decor was upscale going for romantic but the kitschy cow art and eclectic selection of music (from the 70s?) kind of threw off the ambiance.    CLASSIC CAESAR: BF's pick, huge portion with several anchovies. I liked how the croutons were served on the side, as I don't care for them, but the full-leaf romaine used made it difficult to serve this dish without making a mess. HAND-CUT WAGYU TARTARE: I am a tartare fanatic and this version, mixed tableside, did not disappoint. Flavorful American beef accented with red onion, quail egg, and parsley, simple but very good. Plenty of crostini provided, too. PORTERHOUSE FOR TWO: $98/32oz, huge portion and cooked to perfect medium rare. This was served with a bearnaise sauce I didn't care for, and the meat was lacking a flavorful crust. The pan sauce perfectly complemented the meat. Porterhouse is served sliced, and brought to the table with the bone marrow.  POTATO PUREE: Portion goes farther than it seems, because it is so freaking rich. Texture was so smooth it was like velvet. Enjoyed this more than I thought I would, definitely one of the must-get sides. CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER LAVA CAKE: I'm not really a lava cake person, but this version filled with peanut butter was quite good. Cake was moist, chocolate-PB contrast is hard to screw up, the vanilla ice cream paired well with this. Wish I had thought to sub the cinnamon ice cream, which sounds even better.   Service, especially from bussers, was attentive, and the booths are intimate for a date night or special occasion dinner with family. Highly suggest making reservations- even on a late weekday evening, the dining room was packed. The three-course dinners (just pick your meat, staff picks the sides and starters) sound like the best experience, will opt to go that route next time.",

    "text": "My experience with Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak was beyond satisfaction, it was immaculate.  My company had their annual Vegas dinner here back in July and I was lucky enough to take part this year. Right of the batch, I fell in love with the cozy atmosphere with the dimmed lights and soft background music. We were seated promptly after showing up at our RSVP time. The server made sure to greet us, briefly introduce the restaurant's history and most popular items on the menu, then proceeded to take our drinks order. When he came back to take our order, that was when we were informed that we were going to do the Chef's Tasting Menu, and I was ecstatic to hear that LOL.  Appetizer round came with jumbo shrimp cocktail, avocado salad, warm frisee salad, premium prosciuto and bread stick, buffalo mozzarella and balsamic vinaigrette. Unfortunately, I did not take any photos of how amazing they first came out, but I can tell you that they all tasted amazing. The one this that stood out to me the most in this round was the warm frisee salad. The salad came to the table with an egg par-poached, the server then broke it and mixed it in with the frisee. The salad also has pancetta  and crumbled blue cheese in the mix. It was a fantastic starter for our dinner. Aside from the salad, the jumbo shrimp cocktail was also very delicious. They were cooked to perfection and accompanied by a great cocktail sauce.  Entree round came with the filet mignon, rib-eye, skirt steaks, and flat iron. The side dishes were the infamous sweet corn, mushroom, creamy potatoes, sauteed brocolette and roasted asparagus. THEY WERE ALL SOOOOOOOOO AMAZING. My personal favorite steak was between the rib-eye and the skirt steaks. For a carnivore like myself, I was like a kid in a candy store. All the flavor go extremely well together and they all were cooked to the perfect mid-rare that a steak deserves. The side dishes did not have a supporting role in this play, they equally earned their spot on the table. The infamous sweet corn lived to its name, infamous. It is True that you have to get it when they put it on the menu. Don't hesitate, it is a must. Another standout as for the side dishes would be the sauteed brocolette. Cooked to perfection and wonderfully seasoned. The one dish wasn't a hit for me was the roasted mushroom. Don't get me wrong, I love mushroom, all kind of mushroom, so I was excited to see the dish when it got to the table. However, it lacked salt and too watery for a roasted mushroom dish, my expectation was higher.  Dessert round came around and we instantly grew a separate stomach for all the delicious sweet treats: mango cheese cake, chocolate layered cake, banana pudding, assorted ice cream and sorbet, assorted fruits, and the my absolute favorite - sticky monkey bread... YUM!  Service: 5+ STARS! One of the most attentive and detailed service I have had. I love listening to servers explaining the menu and what they are serving. It really shows who loves the job there and who doesn't. There's no way you can enthusiastically talk about food without truly having the passion for it.  Overall, it was a very pleasant experience for time we spent here. Definitely will come back and recommend it to anyone I know paying a visit in Vegas.",

Decor was nice and the place in general was pretty dim. We made reservations but don't think you really need to at this place unless you have a big party or it's a packed holiday. We got sat a booth and for some reason, there was a portrait of a sad looking cow right above us (still ate steak with no shame though).   Service: 5 stars. Waiter was super friendly and explained the menu. Had multiple people come by asking how we were doing including the manager.   Food: 5 stars. Was gonna get the a5 wagyu but lebron lost me money...so I decided to get the domestic wagyu New York strip. It was a perfect size and seriously cut like butter, SO DELICIOUS. For comparison, my friend got the t-bone and it tasted like he got it from Denny's after eating the wagyu. We got a few sides, I'd recommend the yukon puree and risotto. We also got the asparagus which was alright. Basically long story short : you're already here, GET THE WAGYU.   Only annoying thing was the person that came by to take pictures of us then tried to charge us 25 bucks for a copy. The person wasn't annoying just the theme park feel of that. But besides that, everything else was great, will be coming back to try the other wagyu cuts.",

Asparagus had very little seasoning or lemon zest.  Carrots were okay but I've had much better honey glazed heirloom carrots elsewhere.  Potato puree was spot on (but not as good as Atelier Joel Robuchon in Paris (can't speak to the Las Vegas location)).  The house rolls with fleur de sel were the best of the night.

Everything we ordered was exceptional.   Starters:  mozzarella salad - phenomenal not your traditional mozzarella salad but very interesting and delicious rendition.   The cucumber watercress salad was amazing. Very crisp, refreshing and light. This Had to be one of the best salads I've had in a long time. To think something so simple and uninteresting as cucumber and watercress could taste so good, the dressing really delicious.   Mains:  16oz NY strip- AMAZING steak! cooked to perfection. Well seasoned, incredibly tender and just mouthwatering.  Added a side of Scallops to accompany the steak. They were outstanding.   Service was fantastic, I think the bartenders name was Larry, a total rock star. Thank you for the terrific experience, suggestions,and service.

The bread was amazing so warm and soft and so much flavor from the butter. Ribeye and filet were cooked well and the sauce that came with the ribeye was so bomb! Highly recommend but be ready to wait at all times during dinner rush hour.",

    "text": "Do this at least once in this lifetime.   If ever I felt compelled to write a review for a restaurant this is the one. One visit and I found myself instantly hooked. I don't ever plan to visit Vegas again without coming back here. I've dined in nearly half the states and I've never had a meal equally commiserate in both quality and quantity as the meal I shared here with my friend for her 40th. We had the surf and turf option, and it was a bit like being on a blind date. The team semi-surprises guests with choice picks from their phenomenal menu. We ended up with 15 items from starters to dessert and ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING was delicious to both of us.   We were served: bread and butter, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, lobster bisque, two different salads, pate, lobster tails, ribeye steak, filet mignon, creamed potatoes, mango sorbet, chocolate mousse cake, shortbread cookies with strawberry ice cream, and something else nearly indescribable. With a non-alcoholic drink, tax and tip it was about $200/person. Yes, that was my most expensive meal to date, but it was really several meals in one. You can opt for a smaller meal, but considering the prix fixe meal is more like an incomparable dining experience I can only highly recommend going all the way. As if the delectable food wasn't enough my friend had two cocktails and she barely made it out the restaurant (go hard here and you may not make it home). Without a doubt this feast was absolutely fabulous, fantastic, and enthralling. I must say I also enjoyed the overdose of good service, too. At least four servers and the manager frequented our table which undoubtedly made this a rich experience in every sense of the word.   Warning: Because there's so much food that's decadent and drenched in \"top shelf\" butter you absolutely cannot eat it all and unless you're going to a room with a kitchenette you'll likely have the misfortune of having to toss out at least a bit or perhaps a lot of your leftovers. Wasting even a morsel felt like a travesty. Vegas has pretty good food, but hands down I'd pick this restaurant as the city's first place winner.",

Most places don't do that. I really appreciated that sine I really don't like to waste food. Caesar with white anchovy's. If you've never had white anchovy's they are more mild than regular with more of vinegar flavor. Really a great taste. Then a 10 oz filet. I don't usually eat filets but most of the steaks here are really large. It was one of the best I've ever had. Half order of sauteed spinach and I was perfectly satisfied. Good guys at the bar.",

The overuse of chives. There were so many piled on our salad that you couldn't even see the poached egg, and they weren't even fresh, they were dried. It was too much. 2. Our mashed golden potatoes were gluey. I'm guessing that wasn't the intention. If it was, it shouldn't have been. 3. It was too much food. It could have easily served 4 people. We had so much left over that it seemed wasteful and, being Vegas, you have no fridge or microwave to take anything back to your room for later.  That all being said, the bisque was amazing. The desserts were excellent but the lobster was a little mealy in places and the dried chives overpowered everything. They literally ruined the perfectly poached egg on the salad. I have no regrets except, had I known, I would have asked them to lay off the dried chives.",

    "text": "Overall, I would say that Craftsteak is definitely coasting a bit off the Tom Colicchio/Top Chef reputation, but still provides a great meal.  We were excited for the seafood platter which unfortunately was a little disappointing.  I can't remember what types of oysters they gave us but they were a fairly bland and flavorless selection to put on our sampler.  The rest of the platter included shrimp, crab legs, littlenecks and a littleneck shell filled with some salty delicious caviar, but the only real highlight of the platter was the lobster salad, heavy on the citrus and with no trace of dairy, just the way it should be.  Still, I'd avoid this item in the future, despite an abundance of interesting accompanying sauces that I hesitate to use too heavily on delicate seafood items anyway.  It would be a mistake for anyone to come here and not order the lobster bisque.  Unfortunately, not being lobster-crazed like much of this country, I made this mistake.  But the tastes I was given from friends' bowls revealed the most delicious, rich bisque I have ever had the occasion to try.  The bisque is overflowing with delicious lobster meat, and the base is just amazing, a well seasoned, creamy amalgamation of full but delicate lobster flavor, tarragon, and a level of complexity that allowed you to experience multiple different flavor changes across the few seconds that spanned each bite.  Our steaks were delicious, although overpriced.  I think even in a great restaurant in Vegas, $60+ is really pushing the limit for a standard preparation of a classic NY strip.  Also, in a rare swap of personal preferences of certain intangibles, I think the sample I had of my friend's filet here may have beaten out my NY strip.  The final highlight here was definitely the creamed spinach.  Made with a bechamel sauce, grated parmesan cheese and chili flakes, the spinach is an unbelievably rich, full and delicious side dish that carries just a tiny bit of kick which is unexpected and extremely welcome.  I cannot wait to try to replicate this dish at home!  Our waiter was extremely kind to allow us to order a bottle of wine only listed on the by-the-glass menu and simply charge us as if we had ordered four glasses.  Two of these allowed us to kind of go all out ordering and still manage to keep the bill to $400 before tax and tip.  Less than we were expecting I suppose, but still pretty pricy.  Anyway, I probably wont be back, but mostly for the sheer volume of exciting cuisine in this city.",

I thought all the steaks were very flavorful...NY strip Wagyu was my favorite...and Rib Eye was pretty damn good as well. They had a nice wine selection (mark up wasn't too too bad). Overall sides were prepared well and tasted great (we stuck to mainly the Vegetable selection: asparagus, green beans, mushrooms, and mini squash). Overall, I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "I think you're an adorable little thing Tom Colicchio, but Craftsteak was kind of meh. I hear the bread they serve was amazing, but my South Beach ass declined.  The service was lovely.  Many of the sides were delish but they all felt so oily, greasy, heavy.  The steak was steaky I guess, the short ribs had that satiny full of fat mouthfeel that kind of weirds me out but tastes amazing, and the bison was the standout.  Note to self - next time order the bison.  The things I liked best about my meal were the salads and the butterscotch mousse.  The space is gorgeous and cozy, but I certainly won't be in any hurry to come back.  Also, the lady that comes around with the camera, you might just want to send her away.  The pictures she took were awfully blurry and grainy and insanely priced - for that price you'd think you'd get a nice photo.  Sadly, no.",

    "text": "Let me just start off by saying that I'm not a fan of Tom Colicchio in any way, shape or form.  In fact, he irks me, but that's another story. Despite my feelings about him, I was impressed by Craftsteak.   I have to say I was really hesitant about dining here because of the whole \"celebrity chef\" thing. I'm more about the food than I am about names, but I thought the menu sounded great and the reviews here were good so I gave it a go.   I'm really glad I did.  The food was on point and ranked as highly in my book as some of the better restaurants I've eaten at in NY and SF.  We enjoyed the heirloom tomato salad and shrimp cocktail for a starter and both were tremendous in flavor.  The tomatoes were beautifully ripened and perfectly dressed.  The shrimp were large and wonderfully fresh.   For our entree, we split the 16 oz ribeye, which was cooked to perfection in a veal reduction sauce.  Omg the sauce!  I was dipping everything possible into it and would have licked the plate if I could.  I'm a small girl, but I could have finished that steak on my own, don't let the 1 lb freak you out.  The sides were wonderful as well, the roasted carrots in honey were AMAZING.  They tasted even better in the steak jus.    I really enjoyed my dinner and would most definitely return.  Don't let your thoughts, good or bad, about Tom sway you.  It's worth a visit and will start your night off right in Vegas.  Oh and for the gluten-free eaters, Craftsteak will work with you on what you can order.  Another plus for me!",

The roasted chicken was over cooked and disgusting.  they messed up on the french fries that we had ordered on the side.... it was burnt!!!!!!!!!  the service was horrible.... we saw a waitress maybe once or twice... throughout the night before we were given the check. She never once came by to check on us and the food!!!!!  our main server was the bus boy who got everything and was friendly enough to check on us... unlike the waitress.  we did make reservations and ended up being seated 30 min later as well..  5 star restaurant? I THINK NOT!  THINK AGAIN BEFORE COMING HERE.  our bill came out to 225.  for over cooked food...",

    "text": "Ok, as a Top Chef fan, I wasn't going to not stop by Tom's place while in LV!  Let me preface by saying I read all the reviews on here before I went...so this is why the first thing I immediately ordered was the Lobster Bisque as my First Course.  While delicious, the serving of bisque is ENORMOUS, and soooo rich.  I should have stopped about 1/2 way through, but because of the intoxicating flavor I couldn't.  While I sipped my wine waiting for the meat course, and anxiously awaiting the yummy tenderness of the Waygu Skirt Steak...I felt my tummy start to turn.  Then, I felt it start to do flip-flops.  Uh-oh, the creamed soup had reared its ugly head.  I ate about 5 slices of the yummy steak and about 2 forkfulls of the creamy yukon gold potatoes before I just couldn't eat another bite.  I was officially sick to my stomach.  I took a couple trips to the restroom, but just couldn't shake it.  We left without dessert (WAH!) and spent the rest of the night in our hotel room regretting the bisque. And paying $250 for a dinner we could barely eat.    I'm sure it would have been great if I just hadn't eaten that bisque.",

    "text": "Final Decision: My new favorite beef is WAYGU  So it has been the long awaited trip to Vegas to check out this spot since we explored one of the sister restaurants, Craft Los Angeles, last holiday season, and the food was tremendous there, the expectations were high the were met and destroyed it like Rambo part deux.  So we wanted to try one of their steaks and possibly two side items and a dessert, but we were enticed by the three course Waygu beef meal.    So you think it would be an appetizer salad and main dish with a side and a single dessert, well much like yourself, we thought wrong.  See the following.  Service: superb...although the waiter combo we had a very heavy latin accent that we both had a hard time figuring out what they were describing on the menu.  But the winner was various selection of food to be coming with the 3 course meal.  Funny thing, one waiter had his glasses resting on the end of his nose and the girl wanted to flick it back up to his bridge.   Decor: dim, roomy, wine racks line a False wall that look like little chutes and leather panels probably straight from the cow's back, talk about using the full cow.   Food served:  Appetizers: Buffalo Mozzarella - spicy and fresh, very nice start to a meal as there was a light olive oil and vinegrette surrounding the hefty slices of mozzarella and diced tomatoes.  Avocado Salad - unique, as on one side had wedges of soft avocado, the other a tangy noodle-like veggie, lightly dressed and very refreshing, something we never thought of putting together.  Romaine leaves - long uncut romaine leaved served caesar salad style topped with anchovies, yes anchovies, those things that go on pizza, i didn't touch them myself since i dislike them just as much as you do.   Pacific Coast Prawns - probably one of the most finely prepared crustaceans I've had in a long while.  grilled and lightly seasoned with some salt, pepper, possibly some butter, some smokey spices and chives, they were finger licking good if that was even proper to do.  There was a cocktail sauce, which seemed moot, since the flavor of the prawns were delectable all by itself.  Main Course: Rib eye & Filet - tender, juicy, flavorful, probably two of the most tasty pieces of steaks I've ever tasted.  I can truly understand why these pieces of meat are so sought after.  Lightly seasoned and cooked with a refine red wine herb sauce, a nice complement to the steak.  Yukon Gold Puree - silky, smooth and not your prototypical mash, with each spoonful, its almost like taking a bite of a sour cream and onion potato chip.    Roasted Asparagus - nicely roasted and seasoned well. Soft and flavorful.  Can't mess this dish up.  Assorted Mushrooms - baby shiitake, shimeji, and hen of the woods, all very tasty and grilled well on a small copper skillet.  I have to admit that the ones prepared at the Craft restaurant was more memorable and delicious in comparison to this spot.   Dessert: Cinnamon Monkey Bread - basic cinnamon pullaway with pecan toffee ice cream, interesting dessert, but the ice cream was the winner on this plate, though it can be a little overwhelming in flavor.  Chocolate Ganache Cake - cocoa nibs filled inside a choco cake, making it almost molten when cutting it open partnered up with some sweet whip cream.   Season sorbet - lemon and strawberry sorbet with some fresh black berries, strawberries, black cherries.  A nice third option to have and very light and almost palate cleansing dish.   The meal so delicious and definitely has changed my perspective on steaks.  I'm already dreaming about my next trip to this restaurant.",

Was it an expensive dinner for two?  Absolutely.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely.  I can't say much more than what others have said - our meats came out perfectly perfect (roasted filet and grilled ribeye), the beet salad was delicious (and I didn't even think I liked beets!), the kobe tartare was stupid (and I mean stupid) good, and the yukon gold puree and mushroom medley were heavenly.  We WAY over-ordered, but it didn't matter - it was my birthday dinner to myself so I wasn't about to hold back.  Service was impeccable.  Lighting was slightly dim, but I kind of like that vibe.  Plus it makes my bling sparkle.  ;)    I couldn't decide between CUT and Craftsteak, but after our meal, I was very pleased with my decision.  Happy birthday to me!",

    "text": "I would gladly give Craftsteak a 5-star review but for a few key reasons. 1. We got better food for less than half the price at Delmonico 2. The service was slow. 3 The portions were ridiculously small. 4. They charged $3.50 per soft drink refill  (cheap steakhouses like Sizzler don't even do that and they didn't do that at Delmonico).  In case your interested Delmonico is owned by Chef Emeril Lagasse and tastes better with a much friendlier staff and better food, we regret our decision to go to Craftsteak and will never return. The food was good but did not live up to its $653.00 price tag for 5 people. At Delmonico it was $208.00 for much better food and a much more helpful waiter, and oh by the way I got charged for everytime my glass of water was refilled for the same bottle of water. Why can't I just get charged once per bottle?",

    "text": "I was driving down Las Vegas Blvd and was thinking to myself \"craftsteak or Outback, Craftsteak or Outback\" and i couldnt decide, so i flipped a coin, heads for Craftsteak and tails for Outback. Landed on Heads!  Wasnt able to find menu prices on line, so here's the rundown. Steaks range from about 36 bucks (10 oz hanger) to 56 for a 10 oz filet mignon. You can also purchase steaks for hundreds of dollars that are imported from Japan (or something like that) but i stuck with the 'cheaper' steak, which didnt let me down.  The Check for 2 people came to 168 (before tip)  and this included: 2 steaks, one cocktail, one diet coke, mashed potato side, frisee (?) salad and a side order of mushrooms (the most expensive one which was 24 bucks, it was a samping). There was no room for dessert at the end, certainly enough food.  They serve this INCREDIBLE bread before the meal, its so good you dont really even need butter.....so, if you order a bunch of food, beware that this very tempting bread is going to come out, you might want to keep this in mind before ordering a ton of food you might not be able to finish. If i had known this bread was coming out, i might have skipped either the mushrooms or the potatoes.  The service was pretty good and everyone was very friendly and a manager (i think) came by the table at the end and asked if we enjoyed our meal and he really thanked us for coming by and dining with them.  Looking forward to going back!",

Our waiter was clearly seasoned. I booked our reservation on line and was able to add a note that we were celebrating my hubby's birthday. They brought over a surprise vanilla bean panna cotta for him after dinner. Perfect light ending to our night. Can't wait to return. It's a new favorite.

    "text": "We were about to go to some \"old time\" \"rat pack\" style steak house near downtown that people were recommending... but a nagging voice told me this would be a huge mistake... and I didn't want to make a mistake...I wanted to eat a really great steak. You see how I just got smart with words? Just there? Get it? Mistake / Steak? You see, it seems that once you have been to the mountain top, its hard to go slum it in rougher strung out pawn shop parts of the valley, so I made a last minute and very decisive decision as my executive brain is wired to do... we are going to Craftsteak... nothing less will suffice. Just because one is in Vegas... one need not roll the dice when it comes to dinner. Am I right? Or am I right? Your so right Mr. Papageorgio.   Anyway, while I have been to the location in LA, I had not yet been to the one in Vegas, and my foodie instincts told me that it would be just as good. And not surprisingly, I was right.  Now, just to get it out of the way, I will quickly cover the negatives:  1) As compared to the exceptional service interactions we had with virtually every single person we came across working in Vegas on the trip, the hostess the night we went, I believe Sunday May 18, 2014, was leaning toward the rude / I'm totally over doing this job / I'm tired of being nice to people who think they can win me over side of things.... you get the point.  2) While the food is great, well prepared, etc, its a bit of a departure from the type of fare one would consider to be tough to replicate at home if they had seriously good taste, access to a quality grocer, and an ability to prepare food properly... its rather, basic, I'm sure by design... and it lacks that \"over the top\" quality one might hope for, but in no way does it disappoint. To the contrary, it satisfies.   That concludes the negative as I don't hold the restaurant accountable for attracting a lot of drunk DB's who eat like they are in a barn and ask for ketchup.   Now, on to the good:  1) We ate at the bar which was a much more intimate experience both between myself and my dining companion, and our bartender / server. Eddie. Who by the way was a True pro... the best of the best. Eddie has been with the restaurant since it opened 11 years ago. He knows what the hell he is doing and he suffers no fools. I hope he is there when I dine there next. He made our night. 2) They pour the stiffest drinks imaginable. Perfection. 3) While pricey, its actually a great value considering what you get. Top quality food and service.",

My husband and I ate here last week for our splurge meal and it did not disappoint. In particular, we enjoyed the large selections of wine by the glass, the great service that was just enough to be attentive but not pushy or intrusive, but the real star was the food.  We started with a warm frisee salad, which was really out of this world.  Funny to say that about a salad, but I really could not get enough. I had surf and turf, and my husband did the domestic wagyu filet.  We shared sides of roasted cauliflower and grits.  We probably could have just split the filet, since the sides were generous, but live and learn.  We each had a scoop of ice cream for dessert, mine being the coconut sorbet which was truly fantastic.  I would have licked the bowl if I could have.  All in all, it was a great experience, and I would definitely go back again.",

    "text": "We went here to celebrate my fiance's birthday because they serve wagyu beef but I was greatly disappointed. I had Australian wagyu beef before and I couldn't see any of the signature marbling that this meat is known for. We ordered medium rare to really appreciate the fat but the meat we got looked and tasted like a regular steak. The chimichurri was overpowering. The meat should be the highlight of the dish and not what's added to it. I did try to convince myself that it was wagyu beef but I just couldn't convince myself enough. I couldn't even finish the dish because the meat was chewy even if it was medium rare. The prime rib at The Buffet at the Bellagio tasted better and more tender. We felt that the restaurant misrepresented their dish. My point of comparison is Greystone Restaurant. Either I don't know much about Wagyu beef or Greystone Restaurant serves far much better Wagyu beef than this restaurant. With that being said, I do not recommend their Wagyu beef. Order something else. Save your wagyu beef for The Greystone instead.",

Service was on point. I also had the kobe tartare and loved it. It was one of the best tartares Ive had in a while. All the food was cooked perfectly and to top it all off the had a Dogfish 60 min IPA for $7 which I found really odd as a Sierra Nevada was $11.

    "text": "Steak restaurants in Las Vegas, like internet cat sites,  exist in a hyper competitive cut throat market. Some places that would be <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthebomb.com&s=355187a2a784c6ee933e2e46feb84e4a2bbc84cde0736652fb6961a6a23327f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thebomb.com</a> in other markets just can't cut the mustard when compared to Vegas Gold Standards like Carne Vino or Outback. IMHO Craftsteak is just such a restaurant- it is pretty good, but given its similar in cost to just about every steak place on the strip it isn't one I would recommend.   I always get the same thing first time around- Bone in Ribeye, Potato side, Mac and Cheese- except for they don't have mac and cheese- terrorists win :(.   The Steak- the bone in ribeye was mediocre at best. Ordered medium rare the meat was barely pink which was a huge misstep. It didn't have a very good crust and was sort of bland- given how often TC yells at people on Top Chef for incorrectly seasoning, and given it was a steak and should have enough salt on it to choke a deer, this was pretty disappointing. Now again, if this was your first Vegas steak experience you could overlook this and still have a pretty good meal. But if you have been to other great steak restaurants in the area these mistakes become more crushing.   Now I will say- their specialty is clearly the more expensive steaks (US and Australian Wagyu, Kobe... or Japanese Wagyu? Does anyone know what these things mean? Nope? Ok I figured). So I will admit the fault could lie with me not going for a big boy steak.   Potato Gratin-this was actually pretty top notch. It has a garlic cream sauce that is STRONG so if you are on a date or with a fancy prostitute you may want to stay away.  White Corn Grits- I'm from the dirty south so naturally I had to order this. It's not exactly what you would expect if you have been raised on three Michelin star restaurants like Waffle House- but it is chock full of so much bacon and gruyere cheese that you can't really go wrong.   Dessert The Monkey Bread is pretty amazing- overall the sides and dessert were the stars of this meal with the steak more of a creepy extra lurking in the corner. If I went back here I would probably skip the steak altogether and get more apps/sides/desserts.",

I am a real fan of his food!  I have eaten at many high end, low end, and everything in between \"steakhouses\". My experience here was perfect. There is no other word to describe it.  We ordered the chefs selection with wagyu skirt, and wagyu strip, both came out cooked to perfection. They were exactly the way that we ordered them. The service was completely on point, the appetizers delicious (steak tartar, shrimp cocktail, warm frisee salad, heirloom tomatoes), the sides were very good ( brussel sprouts, potato puree, and mushroom assortment), and the monkey bread and perfect chocolate cake made a great ending. You are probably thinking that the portions must've been small to eat all of this, but they weren't. I just kept eating because I literally couldn't stop.  I can't wait to go back. I enjoyed it so much that I want to keep going back until I don't like it anymore.  I guess I will make it a point to watch Top Chef because I am definitely a fan now.",

Located inside the MGM Grand, Craftsteak is a dimly lit, elegantly decorated high end steak house.   The menu at CS is littered with amazing sounding salads, sides, steaks, seafood, desserts and more. Instead of trying one or two things, my wife and I decided to make this meal a memorable one and partake in their Domestic Wagyu tasting, which included a grand total of FOURTEEN dishes in three courses.

Not one dish disappointed me. I've had many meals in my life and this one now ranks as the biggest and best yet. The salads were great. The meat was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sides were fantastic and the desserts were mind blowing. I did have some favorites, which I'll list below.  My favorite dishes in the first course were the tartare and the warm Frisee salad. My favorite dishes in the second course were the Wagyu ribeye and the Yukon Gold Puree (best mashed potatoes EVER).  My favorite dessert was the cinnamon monkey bread.  The service here was top notch. We had two separate servers, both of whom were friendly and attentive. Both answered any questions we asked and trust me, we had a few.    The price for the Wagyu tasting menu was $140 a person, which was not bad considering the massive amount of incredible food we received. In all honesty, I could not afford to do this on a weekly (or even monthly) basis but since I got lucky the night before at the Roulette tables, this meal only set me back about thirty dollars of my own money. Thanks, Vegas.   If you ever have the opportunity to dine at Craftsteak, even if you can't afford a steak tasting (tastings start at $100 a person), then just order off their regular menu. I can't highly recommend Craftsteak enough. This truly was THE BEST meal I've ever had in my entire life.",

We had a 730 reservation for 6 people, we checked in around 732 and waited almost 10 minutes to be sat (with several other 6 top tables open in the back).  After being sat, our table was so wobbly that we requested to sit at another table and this request was promptly fulfilled.  The drink menu is on an ipad, which was way too bright for the dimly lit environment and took too long to maneuver through, especially when there is only one ipad for 6 people.  Also, after being sat, an individual came around asking to take our picture and told us that she would return at the end of our meal with the photos (for purchase).  What is this... some cheesy amusement park?  Not the level of service I'm expecting when purchasing a $75 steak.  The waiter repeatedly informed us that 4 people would be taking care of us, well, unless he was referring to the individual filling waters, the bus boy, and the food runner, we only saw him and even then, this was rare.  After being sat, we also informed the waiter that we had a 10pm show to get to and asked if this would be a problem, he ensured us that it would not be.  Over an hour and a half after being sat, we finally had dinner.  Mind you, this is now about 915 and we have a 10pm show to get to at the Bellagio.  We literally were forced to rush through dinner in about 20-25 min and prematurely ask for the check so that we could be on our way.  This was by far the biggest disappointment of our Vegas trip, not to mention the biggest waste of money as we couldn't even enjoy our meal.",

We had a reservation and were promptly seated in a nice cushy booth. The restaurant was packed, but it wasn't the usual \"so loud I can't hear anything you say\" loud. Our friendly waiter brought my perfect Dirty Martini quickly and made great recommendations on the menu.  We ordered the Chef's Selection package which was pricey--but again totally worth it and a TON of food.  We selected the Kobe cuts of the NY steak and Rib Eye with a side of 1/2 a lobster. The lobster was a decent size and wonderful; and both steaks were melt in your mouth delicious and so perfectly prepared, I might never be able to have \"regular\" steak again.   The package came with a ton of sides, we ordered the mushroom assortment, a potato gratin and 3 (!) salads the highlight being the Buffalo Mozzarella salad. It was actually way too much food, but everything was amazing.  I've read some complaints about the photographer, but since it was our anniversary, I didn't mind. She was a bit overpriced, but the photos are very high quality and a nice momento we wouldn't have otherwise gotten.  All in all, a perfect meal and evening. Just writing this is making my mouth water. Eating there again is incentive enough to go back to Vegas more often!",

The waitstaff said to split the serving but I had the whole thing.  Unfortunately, it cost me room to eat the rest of the steak. Pay the money and get the wagyu 12 oz skirt steak.  This piece of meat offers the best flavor and the wagyu preparation makes it incredibly tender.  The sweet potatoes and crostini mushrooms are great additions.   The waist staff have terrific knowledge base and are very kind.  I met the executive sous chef at the restaurant as he was walking through and you can tell he loves being there, it shows in the food.",

We ordered off the large party menus before we got there and we had a sample of everything, salad, oysters, buffalo mozzarella, the bread (my god the bread is amazing) chicken, ribeye, porterhouse, everything was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The desserts were just as good but by that point everyone was so full we had trouble putting a dent in the anything other than the monkey bread and sorbet.

    "text": "craft steakhouse does not make the cut  Upon entering we were looking forward to a great dining experience. Like all fine dining restaurants, it begins with service and Craftsteak fails miserably. After being seated and looking over the wine list, we decided against ordering wine. The head waiter returned and found out that we would not be ordering wine and the average service went okay to terrible. He took the orders and NEVER returned until the check was dropped off. We were treated disrespectfully because we were not willing to purchase a $100 bottle of wine to increase his tip. The food was quite average as well. The meats were prepared nicely, however, the sides and salads were very below average. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were something that I can do better at home. We have dined at many celebrity chef restaurants in Las Vegas and this one certainly doesn't make the cut!!!",

    "text": "Tom Colicchio...Please pack your knives and go...just kidding...you win!  After seeing Tom, the judge on Top Chef, my wife and i decided to check out Tom, the chef at Craftsteak. We arrived around 6PM on a Saturday, and the restaurant was near empty, but by the time we left at 7:30PM, it was packed. So get their early.  Together we tried:  (1) Spinach Persimmon Salad - i don't eat rabbit food at a steakhouse, but my wife thought it was good (??/5) (2) Wagyu Beef Tartare - the best thing i ate, share with at least 2 people(5/5) (3) Brussel Sprouts with Bacon - a little too salty, but delicious nonetheless (4/5) (4) Yukon Gold Puree - fancy and buttery, but still mashed potatoes (3.5/5) (5) Ribeye Steak - perfectly crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside (4.5/5)  The damage came out to $200 including tax and tip w/o drinks for two people.  The service was impeccable.  We were never without water, and there was someone checking in every 10-15 minutes to see if we needed anything.  I would say the food is excellent, but on par with some of the other premium steakhouses I've tried.  I guess if money isn't a factor it would be nice, but considering us normal people.  I've had food just as good for less. 4.5 Stars",

Order the steak tartare. Perfectly seasoned and yummy. We split the rib eye which was cooked perfectly. Rissoto was not up to par but was taken off the check no problem. They went out of their way to bring the dessert with birthday and anniversary wishes. A fantastic vanilla bean panna cotta with fresh fruit. Unbelievable! Not on the menu but you must ask for it. A great meal and it was the highlight of our day!",

Asked for a nice glass of red (was $50 or so and tasted good with the steak) The wagyu filet mignon at a whopping $300 tasted good but well... tasted like a big cut of filet mignon (thank God this was free) The yukon gold puree were excellent as was the mushroom assortment (couldn't even finish it)  The staff from hostesses to my server were VERY friendly.  They charged my phone while I was there and made jokes all night.  Good people, good crowd, good vibe, good food.  Left extremely full and satisfied.",

    "text": "This place was my very first stop on my latest trip to Vegas.  I landed a bit late to meet my friends on time at the restaurant, but it was all good.  The service was very accommodating considering there were 10 people there before two of us showed up.  I sat down, took a quick look at the menu.  There were plenty of delicious cuts to choose from, but I went with a 12oz. hangar steak.  Of course it wasn't the biggest steak I've ever eaten, but it definitely packed a lot of flavor.  Our waiter explained his recommendation for how to dip/pour the extra sauce onto it.  I didn't order any sides, but I had my hand in one of the corn sides and mashed potatoes (or potato puree?).  Soooo good!  Wash that all down with some Yamazaki 12yr and it was a great start to an awesome weekend!  Next time, I really want to relax a bit more and enjoy my meal, but that was because I landed late and not the restaurant rushing me in anyway.  Might have to bump up the review if i get another solid experience!",

All were great, Tom's restaurants are always simplistic culinary excellence.  I highly recommend the short ribs, monkey bread and sorbet. The paster chef needs to have his or her name on the menu, IMO they're better than Bouchon.  The wine list at CS is ridiculous, even if you're a wine sommelier or an experienced aficionado you will be impressed. I cannot say enough good things about CS.   The only downside to to this amazing restaurant is the younger \"D-bag\" scene has found out about CS and is starting to take over.. :(  Protip: Toms restaurants in Vegas recycle everything and I mean everything. All leftover food is kept and taken to local farms to feed pigs.. Maybe that's why my bacon in the fennel salad was so good, it was eating $100.00 beef all it's life..",

My fiancee and I have been to many steakhouses and without a shadow of a doubt we both agree this is THE best steak we've ever had as well as an overall fantastic experience. We've been here twice (last time was Christmas week, I know I'm a bit late).  The wait staff was on their A game the entire night, never presenting themselves at an inconvenient moment, always at the right time like mind readers! The selection of wine (IMO) is superb. All of the food from the salads to the desert where delicious. Our steaks where cooked perfectly with just the right amount of juice and tenderness and fat and just wow. Excellent. I cannot praise them enough.  There isn't anything negative about this place that I can think of.   If you love steak you will absolutely LOVE Craftsteak. If you are in town, make this a sure stop.   Dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine and a much earned tip ~$275",

My father and grandfathers all were in the wholesale meat business and I grew up eating really good quality meat. I love a prime dry aged steak - but not with just butter on it.  They seasoned it to perfection. My potatoes - the house mashed, were flavorful as was my Caesar salad. I savored every morsel and the wine list by the glass just topped it off. I don't remember what it was but it had the perfect balance - i am sure it was the best Cab on the menu.  I dined by myself because most of my friends went to a class at the convention and it was my last night. The server took great care of me and friends came by to join me for dessert. I will not miss this place next time I am in Vegas. It's my new favorite!  I didn't realize that this restaurant is related to the Craft in Los Angeles.  I can assure you I will be there soon for some special event and it it's near as good, my husband will be in steak heaven too.",

    "text": "I came here last Saturday, 2/18/2012, for dinner with a friend after we were told by a local that this was one of her favorite places to go for steak. We had a 5:45pm reservation and arrived on time but right at the entrance and there was already a line waiting outside. This made me even more excited to come here. The hostess was really friendly and our server was even better. He was friendly, funny, attentive, and offered amazing suggestions. Since it was our first time there, our server suggested us to go with the three course menu that came with the Maine lobster bisque for each person, 3 smaller salads of your choice to share, 3 side dishes of your choice, the main course of your choice, and 3 desserts. We decided to go with the domestic wagyu. Our server recommended us to get it medium rare because all of the fats would be nicely cooked and worked into the meat that way instead of rare so we decided to have it that way. We also ordered the Glenmorangie wood expressions (Highlands) flight for both of us to taste.  The Glenmorangie flight was delicious. You can taste the different oaks in each and it was a nice pour in each of the glasses. The Maine lobster bisque was served initially as an empty bowl so that you can see the herbs and large pieces of lobster and the server pours the hot lobster bisque soup right after. The soup was delicious, light, and creamy. Even better, I really enjoyed the parsley, chives, and large chunks of lobster in the soup which complemented the broth very well. The roasted red peppers salad had a nice soft roasted flavor to it without the char. The peppers were complimented perfectly by the chips of cooked garlic, minced basil, olive oil, pepper, and salt. The wild arugula salad was fresh and crisp and was complimented well by the large piece of shaved pecorino, pine nuts, cracked pepper, and citrus vinaigrette. The warm frisee was fresh and crisp and was complimented perfectly by the perfectly poached egg, deliciously smoked bacon, a strong cheese (not sure what it was exactly), and a mustard dressing. My friend and I shared the filet mignon and ribeye and surprisingly we found that we enjoyed the filet mignon more than the ribeye! Don't get me wrong, both were delicious, flavorful, juicy, and so tender that it could be cut with a butter knife. As recommended by our server, the must have out of the side dishes was the potato puree. It had the texture was soft but with bits of harder chunks of potato and the flavor was so heavenly with the buttery roasted savory flavor. This was so delicious I hard time not eating it even though I was horribly full. The mushroom assortment side dish had a nice mix of different earthy tasting mushrooms which was complimented well by the subtle thyme flavor. The Maui onion was sweet and nicely roasted served in halves. It was so hard to eat dessert by then, but even that was amazing. The delicious fruit plate had 4 thin slices of sweet, crisp, and juicy Asian pear, 2 pieces of sweet and juicy Cara Cara orange, and 2 slices of sweet and sour kiwi. The flourless chocolate cake was thick and moist with a rich chocolate flavor. It was complimented by a creme placed beautifully on top of the cake, a few slices of a tangerine, a citrus sauce, and a raspberry sorbet. We were also given two scoops of sorbet. One was blood orange and the other flavor I couldn't put my finger on. Another must have here was the cinnamon monkey bread that tasted like a heavenly cinnamon bun topped with pecans. It was perfectly complimented by a brown sugar sour cream ice cream. My friend and I were so full but we couldn't stop eating it.   Overall our experience here was phenomenal! Everything here was amazing. The only complaint I have is that I wish I had a bigger stomach to enjoy all of the delicious food.",

    "text": "The only reason I am given two stars is due to our excellent waiter. First, we were walk ins. The restaurant was empty except for perhaps two tables. The hostess said they may not be taking any more walk ins for the evening. She would check. Ten we stood and watched all the waiters standing and gazing at the empty, very large restaurant. She returns and informs us that we would be seated. She said we would be the last walk ins. Our waiter was an old time professional. Excellent. My husband tried to order a scotch that he could only get at Craftsteak. Our waiter said that the new owner is not keeping up the world's second largest array of scotches any more. So he had his usual. My husband ordered a steak and I ordered the scallops. Our sides were fries, mushroom assortment and cauliflower. Cauliflower was awful. Raw inside, almost burnt outside. No flavor. Horrible. Mushrooms, same. Some vaguely slimy, hen of the woods ones, burnt. No seasoning whatsoever. Fries were tasty. Bread was great. My husband's steak was tasteless. My scallops were all right, but I still had sand in my teeth the following morning. This was our favorite steakhouse. I noticed it was headed downhill after the new owner took over. My husband held out hope. No longer. Last visit. I am interested in the fabulous taste experiences the other Yelpers had lately. And very puzzled. The prices are the same as before. Huge. That's fine. But give me what I expect for that price. Even the chair I was sitting in was cheesy, vastly uncomfortable and about to collapse. As a grand finale, when we left, there were no more people in the place than when we arrived. Sad from start to finish.",

Yes, it is expensive (over $100) but it was a very big cut of meat and why not go big in Vegas?  Despite making reservations of 8:15, we didn't get seated until about 8:30 but it was a busy weekend with March Madness (Final Four) going on.  We unfortunately got seated next to some construction conventioneers who were pretty wasted. They were loud and very vulgar, the F-word was about every third word out of one guys mouth, and I think Marvin our server sympathized with us. He hooked us up with an appetizer and a dessert on the house!  I saw some people complain about the wait for the food and honestly, without Marvin bringing us out the complementary appetizer it would of been a pretty substantial wait.... A wait well worth it!",

Our pre-meal snack kept the dinner selections light, and selective by just ordering the essentials and leaving out the fluff. The meal began with cocktails and the most delicious dinner rolls served hot and fresh. I had to control myself from eating every single one of those slightly buttery/salty buns. Our first course was just a couple Kumamoto oysters which were light and fresh. A few minutes later our 18 oz. Ribeye Black Angus, Bone In and side of roasted corn arrived. The steak was cooked a delicious medium-rare and came pre-cut which made sharing much easier. The waiter said that the corn was in season and especially good and he was right, as it seem to be cooked in the steak's drippings, but i doubt it was.  Our bill came out to about $100 along with two drinks, and i thought it was worth it.",

Talked me into getting a Filet as a substitute. Arrived blood rare. Was still looking for medium-rare. It went back for another 10 minutes, and came back fine. Flavor was not as good as I remember. Seemed under seasoned and dry. Huge difference from November 2011. I've had WAY better steaks at Ruths and Flemings. Too bad this steak house can't deliver a good steak anymore.",

    "text": "This is my favorite steak-house of all time.  Better than Maestros, SW steakhouse (wynn), Ruth Chris...etc.  I've been here a couple times so I will review the last couple things I ate from various trips:  Meats: 1) Wagyu skirt steak.  It's melt-in-your-youth goodness.  After 3-4 pieces, it does get very rich, so my recommendation is to order it for the table and share family style.  It's a definite must-try. 2) Porterhouse:  AMAZING.  Perfectly seasoned and very tender.  It is a very large cut, so definitely needs to be shared with more than just 2 people (menu recommends 1 order/2 people, but it can feed 3 or 4 even, especially when you order side dishes too) 3) T-bone: Very tasty, but does not compare to the Porterhouse or Wagyu steak.  Still a great choice although the filet side is a bit dryer than all the other cuts. 4) Braised Short Ribs: Very tender.  The meat pretty much melts in your mouth.  This dish is a bit smaller in size, so it's not as filling as eating a steak.  Although the dish is well-prepared, I think ordering the steaks here is a much better option.  I've never had better steak anywhere else, but I have had comparable braised short ribs.  Sides: 1) Mushroom risotto:  If you like risotto, this is a must.  Probably the BEST risotto i've ever had.  Unfortunately, it wasn't available last time I was here.  They replaced it with another dish that they said was comparable but it wasn't at all. 2) Mushroom assortment:  A nice side if you enjoy eating mushrooms with your steak.  Good, but nothing too special.   3) Potato puree:  Very smooth and rich.  It' s a nice side if you like butter.  I think they put a lot of butter into the puree.  It's like eating very creamy mashed potatoes 4) Asparagus:  A nice side if you want some greens in your meal, but it taste just like asparagus prepared anywhere else.  Not too special. 5) Corn: I forgot what they call it on the menu and it's only on the menu when it's in season, but this is one of the BEST side dishes here.  They grill the corn and then take it off the cob for you, so it's not cream corn, but more like grilled corn.  Very flavorful.  If you happen to eat here when it's available, it's a must-order.  Dessert: 1) Cinnamon monkey bread:  A bit too sweet for my tastes, but my friends really liked it.  If you love sugar, then maybe this dessert is for you, but it was way too sweet for me. 2) Chocolate souffle: Very rich.  If you like chocolate and u like rich desserts, this may be the pick for you.",

The first course can be a selection of appetizers and cold plates, and we asked the chef to choose. We wound up with prosciutto, some avocado with glaze stuff, buffalo mozzarella, and a beautiful lobster bisque. Wonderful assortment to start the night, and I highly recommend the lobster bisque. The main course we chose was the Domestic Wagyu selections, and again the chef selected, and we wound up with flank steak and fillet for the meats, and we had potatoes gratin, artichoke, and mushrooms for sides. The meat was so delicate and flavorful, and you get a VERY large serving for two people. The potatoes gratin was very well done! For dessert, we got the monkey bread, some sorbets and ice creams, and a great little banana tart/cake. So much food we rolled out of there two hours later. I was not disappointed by any aspect of this meal! I will be there again next time I'm in Vegas!",

I really don't know where to start because everytyhing was good from start to finish. The complimentary bread was great, I started off with the lobster bisque which was tasty & smooth, oysters were fresh and of good quality. The highlight of it all was the Wagyu Kobe skirt steak in which I admit is the best steak I have ever tasted!! ( and I've tried various steaks from different places prepared in various ways) the steak was very tender and juicy the way it should be. The sides that I had with the steak (huge scallops, mushroom medley, white corn, yukon gold mashed potatoes) were awesome, no complaints whatsoever.  The service was great as well, the waiter was knowledgeable and on top of things, the atmoshere was lively and well lit. Craftsteak is located on the strip @ MGM Hotel so if you are ever in Sin City and looking for a great steakplace to eat, I highly recommend this place. It's very worth it!!",

    "text": "My husband and I chose Craftsteak as our final evening meal in Las Vegas this past week. We are huge, repeat HUGE, Top Chef fans and have been thinking about this meal for weeks. After eating one of the best meals of our life at Woodfire Grill in Atlanta over a month ago, we figured Craftsteak could top that.   Unfortunately, it didn't. Perhaps we built it up too much in our minds, but the overall experience was A-OK. Now, don't get me wrong, there were elements to our meal that were outstanding, but if you added each course together, it wasn't blow your mind fantastic.  Elements of my meal that were blow-my-mind fantastic - the wild arugula and shaved pecorino salad and the butterscotch mousse. The arugula salad was topped with a refreshing lemon vinaigrette and pine nuts and had a beautiful long shave of pecorino on top. Simple and phenomenal.   I went back and forth between the filet and the strip steak and chose the filet. I wish I had ordered the strip steak. My filet was not seasoned and the beef flavor was so-so. My husband ordered the surf and turf with the lobster and filet. His filet was better seasoned and the temperature was a bit more accurate to what he ordered than my filet's temperature was to what I ordered. He did say the lobster was the most amazing lobster he has ever had (but he wasn't wowed by his steak either).   He started with the prosciutto, which was paired with an Asian pear chutney and he also said that was good. We ordered the roasted garlic and leek gratin to share and that was good...again, nothing that wowed us.  But, the other element that wowed me was dessert. The butterscotch mousse was incredible. A delicious blend of salty sweet smooth goodness. i could have eaten just the butterscotch mousse and been happy. It was served with praline cookies and my husband put the mousse on top of the cookie, but I chose to eat my mousse separate.   Overall, it was a good experience, but when you are spending what we spent, we wanted more than just good.",

    "text": "Craftsteak is a rock solid dining experience.  I am a creature of habit but not a selfish prick so when a Vader says he wants to have steak for dinner, I don't object.  I should because I hate eating steak dinners and Shibuya is my favorite Vegas restaurant of choice.  Steak dinners are so gal'dern filling and who in the f*ck wants a chunk of rotting flesh in their gut before, during, and after they put away a small keg of beer.  Vader, our friend, that's who.  He's the type of douche who will eat steak, sip port, smoke a cigar, and show off his over sized wristwatch just to do it.  It's been a hard year for everyone I imagine.  Even the thoroughbreds of my friendslist have taken a dive this year.  So I check with Ev, my other friend present that he doesn't have a problem with eating a $60 steak, without sides.  He signs on and we enter Craft.  We have a cocktail at the bar and our table is ready quick so it's less than one drink and we're down at a very nice corner booth.  The sommelier appears, I request one his personal favs on the list, under $200 and he reappears with a grenache...not exactly what I would have picked.  And he decanted it before he presented it so I was locked in.  I order seafood.  Ev and Vader order steak, of course.  Big ones.  Kobe.  Vader orders just about every side on the menu.  And soon a ludicrous amount of food starts to arrive.  Followed by our mains.  It was all very good and totally satisfying.  The mushrooms, reetahdid good.  My faith in the sommelier must have tickled him because he didn't leave our table all night.  We bought another bottle of wine and then he brought out as our third, a '97 cab, on the house.  After dinner, he brought us a half bottle of ice wine, on the house.  WTF?  Dude, I'm straight but I will pimp you one of my friends if it means you keep bringing wine.  So, we're at the end of the meal and the check comes.  I know it's north of $500 so I don't bother looking and just throw my card down and Ev does the same.  Vader is still checking his wallet, surveying the bill, and then looks up to say, \"you guys are gonna have to spot me, I didn't know you were going to order all that wine,\" and puts forth no money.  Those of you reading this with even scant intelligence can imagine the ensuing conversation so I'll spare you.  But I'm obviously arrested at the notion that he just went an entire dinner in an establishment that he recommended knowing that he didn't have any money and ordered the most expensive shit on the menu and didn't say a word until the bill arrives!  I'm the kinda guy who won't make you feel stupid; I'll just bring it up down the road at a time of my convenience.  Ev...a different story.  He blows his stack.  And Vader has the audacity to get indignant about his attack.  Now I'm starting to fume because the whole thing is obviously premeditated and now Vader is claiming it's not his fault but ours.  Okaayyyy...  I put Vader's chunk on my tab and when he's in the bathroom, we ditch him for the night.  I mean sh*t, it's the least we could get away with given how rightfully pissed we were at this twat.  Plus, believe it or not, this not the second time this has happened, but the third time I've had to pick up someone else's tab, in Vegas.  Never go to Vegas with anyone who can't afford it.  We leave, hook up with some friends, get in a cab, direct it to Tryst and a comedy of error ensues beyond imagination...",

I asked to send it back and the server explained she didn't think I was going to like it as it is often sent back.  The main courses were awesome.  The steaks were prepared as we asked and tasted great.  I would say overall I was expecting more because of the name.",

    "text": "As a Chicago resident, I have dined in just about every high end steakhouse my city has to offer, so I know a thing or two about what to expect from a place that the caliber craftsteak portrays themselves as. My wife and I dined there on 09/30 for my B'day while in Las Vegas- we chose this steak house because we are both Top Chef fans and thought it would a great way to celebrate. Upon arriving, we were seated in a prompt manner and that was probably the best experience we had all night. In short- I was HIGHLY disappointed with our meal and experience.   Our service was terrible because our waiter was awful. They use a \"team\" approach, but one guy was the main person for our service and he doesn't even belong at an Outback. He more than once tried to entertain the table seated next to us- while engaged with my wife and I, he challenged my wife on a glass of bourbon she ordered from their menu (made a bit of a show by flipping threw their 100 page drink menu at the table instead of inquiring with the bar), never told us anything about the menu, and when I asked if there were any chef specials for the night, his response was \"our menu is printed every day, so I like to think that everything is special\". He was very unprofessional and he never once talked about the steaks on the menu they had to offer!! Needless to say, I didn't order one.   The basics of service were never covered. I even had to order another glass of bourbon from the bus boy after sitting without one for about 10 minutes- that's how bad it was. If you are going to charge the prices they do, I don't care if you are busy, slow, or completely dead, there is a level of service that is expected and should be executed on. Tom C talks about this all the time on his show, and maybe we got the only bad apple out of the group, but we were both appalled by at one point, upset about it.   Regarding the food- I have to say that it was overpriced. I had the braised short ribs- a specialty of Tom C and was very happy with them, but everything else was just average. We had high expectations that night and both left the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouths.",

For the winter season they had the taster menu starting at $110, so me and a few buddies split that while our big winner in the group got the grade 10 kobe filet mignon. On here i see reviews state its the best steak they had ever had. Great, i want to believe them, but after eating i really question if they had been outside Outback before. This stuff is far from the best. Infact, i had better $30 steaks while traveling through the Dakotas, mid-west and even some areas outside NYC.   This is one of the rare instances where yelp is completely wrong with the review. I will never go back because the meat is not worth the price - simply put. Even the $200 steak was just a great steak. Ive had great steaks at 10% that price.   The sides were mediocre, nothing spectacular. Yukon gold puree, raw kobe tartar, mushrooms, truffles (not cooked enough).   I can see im harping on the price of the products here, but its hard to not let it affect my decision.   Look at Sherry T's review, its very accurate.",

The first thing that came out were the dinner rolls, they were small but topped with some butter and freshly grind-ed sea slat. It was agreed that if this was any indication of how the rest of meal would be then it was the best choice.  I ordered some oysters, now being from East Coast I am picky and they were OK. A little on the small side but flavorful and good quality shell fish. Then my T-Bone came out. It was cut away from the bone to ensure the proper way I wanted cooked, medium of course. Then the fillet side was so tender I could have cut with a butter knife. The sides we ordered were the carrots and roasted potatoes. The waiter recommended that we split a side and they were large enough to accommodate us.  All and all one of the best steaks I have enjoyed thus far. Cooked perfectly, great service, not too obnoxious and good atmosphere.",

    "text": "The 4 stars is for the 32 oz. porterhouse we ordered that was cooked to perfection!  When you make a reservation, you expect to be seated close to the time of your reservation. I didn't expect to be waiting another 30 minutes to be seated, I never even had to wait longer than 10 minutes at the Craft restaurants in NYC! We also got a 10pm reservation so when we were finally seated at our table, it was officially closing time for the restaurant. I will say that we at no point felt rushed to finish our meal... it was only at the end of our LV Craftsteak experience that I felt like we were holding up the staff from going home.  Some items on the menu may change each night so don't be too surprised if you dont see something on the menu you \"thought\" you saw the day before. If you are a type of person who likes to know about the origin or history of something, you'll find the drinks menu an interesting read.  The lobster bisque had a wonderful flavour with huge chunks of lobster. Well worth the price. We also got the prosciutto appertizer that had a super tasty fig jam accompany it. For our mains, we shared the 32 oz. dry-aged porterhouse. This was cooked exactly to our specification. The meat practically melted in your mouth! The sides were ok I guess... we ordered the mushroom risotto and the Jeruselum artichokes. Nothing to rave about there. The sides are a little overpriced but the porterhouse was well worth it (even compared to other steakhouses in Vegas). Dessert for us was the pear sorbet... hmmmm..... I've never had pear sorbet that actually had the texture of a pear. Delish!!  Ok, so things have been going pretty well for now, minus the 30 minute wait at the beginning of the evening. When we finally get the check, here's where the rudeness comes in. While hubby was reviewing the check, the waiter literally came over and snatched the signed credit card receipt from his hands (\"I'll take that!\" he says). WTF?? So, I get that it's late and that the staff want to go home... but hell, we've paid a lot of money to eat here and it wasn't our fault that they took a 10pm reservation and only seated us at 10:30pm with a 10:30pm closing time.   The moral of this review is, don't get a reservation past 9:30pm. The food is great but the help gets cranky past their bedtime.",

And although I don't care too much for lobster or kobe beef or meat in general.. it was delicious!  The sides were good too! I ate more of the sides than the main entrees! I was much too full. We got the delicious corn, mushroom medley, fries, and the mozzarella side.  Excellent wait staff and very nice ambience/decor",

We were a party of six to the Tip was added and for $186.00 the dude should have stood next the table the entire night not been an absentee waiter. I see no reason to go back, None.",

    "text": "We arrived a little early for our reservation, and the hostess directed us to the bar. After about 10 minutes someone came to take us to our booth. We were a party of 4, and we had a large corner booth. We were seated behind a big table with a guy who at one point called the manager over and seemed to be complaining about everything, but we couldn't quite hear what he was saying. The booth next to us was filling with a bunch of drunk guys talking about how they were \"blessed\" enough to be in porn, but the less said about them, the better.  The service was great. Our servers were funny and knowledgeable and made some good recommendations. We ended up ordering separately off the menu and had the mozzarella and lobster bisque (both excellent), and for the entrees, the surf and turf with filet mignon, scallops, short ribs, and the grilled New York strip (not the Wagyu). I didn't try the surf and turf, but the scallop was very good, and the bite of the strip steak that I tried was very good, but the person who ordered it said it was unevenly cooked.  My short ribs were just the right texture, but the gravy was very salty. Without adding much of the gravy, they were good. By the time to order dessert, I was really too full to eat much, but we tried some ice cream and the apple tarte tatin. The tarte was delicious, and the ice cream was good as well.   I'd definitely go back, but next time I'd probably avoid the short ribs because of tghe salt, and stick with a steak since that seems to be what Craftsteak is best at (big surprise). Also the lobster bisque was really delicious.",

    "text": "This is really a 3.5 star review.  The food was solid, not great, but no actual complaints.  Service went from non-existent to a little on the overkill side.  I wonder if my taking notes and pictures had anything to do with that.  Even though I had a reservation, I was seated in the bar/lounge area.  It was very dark and I didn't appreciate every customer walking past me as they entered or exited the restaurant.  The hostess steered me away from the tasting menu since I was dining alone. She boasted about the short ribs and Kobe beef.  Since I new Japan wasn't exporting Kobe anymore, I asked her if it was American or Australian Kobe.  She seemed surprised at my question, but eventually explained that it was Australian.  I was sitting there for 15 minutes before someone offered me a drink.  Once my server, Rachel, brought me water, my lack of service took at 180 degree turn for the better.  She asked me if I had any time constraints, like seeing a show, that she needed to know about.  The parker house rolls topped with clarified butter and sea salt were good.  I could've eaten the whole cast iron pan of them, if I didn't pace myself.  I started with a bowl of rich lobster bisque.  There were nine big chunks of tender lobster meat (yes I actually counted) in the large bowl.  That was a healthy portion size.  I was impressed.  I opted for the house special 24 hour braised short rib, which was served in a copper pot.  The meat was super tender, but flavor-wise was just fine.  I tried a half portion size of the braised brussel sprouts and smoked bacon.  The larger brussel sprouts still had a nice bite, but the smaller ones were too soft.  Rachel, another server, the hostess, and the manager all checked in on me at least once while I was eating.  I decided to go simple for dessert and had the vanilla ice cream that was made on the premises.  It was creamy, you could see the beans, and it had a nice vanilla flavor.  My dinner at Craftsteak started off poorly, but they managed to turn it around.  The food was good, and overall service was better than average.  Rachel packed up my leftovers, gave me a whole new batch of rolls, and include plasticware so that I could eat the rest later.",

    "text": "wow! their food was delicious!!  from beginning, we set reservations at 7pm on a friday night so waiting to be seated took a bit extra time. we just grabbed a drink from their bar. no big deal. after we were seated, our waiter explained the menu to us and of course, suggested the wagyu prix fixe meal which we agreed to.   apps: scallops, two types of salads, and beef carpaccio? if i remember correctly, i didn't have the carpaccio bc that's the only thing the boy would eat b/w the four apps we got. i ate the scallops which were good and tasteful. the salads were delicious but i can't quite remember the names of them. ah well.  entree: wowowow!! skirt steak. OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!! seriously the best cut and grade EVER!!! i really liked this over the filet mignon cut. oh wow! the steak was juicy and tender and just melted in your mouth. ridonk!!! it really is that good. the filet on the other hand was a bit too red for the bf so they cooked it a bit longer and for me, i liked it the first time they brought it out so i didn't enjoy it as much as the skirt steak.   sides: yukon mashed potatoes, mushroom medley, and asparagus. the mushroom medley - i took full charge of. i didn't like how the asparagus was prepared (it was a bit too overcooked for me) and the boy didn't like the different types of mushrooms they had. it worked out perfect for us bc he liked the asparagus (and my pee wouldn't smell) and i love all mushrooms! lol! the mushrooms were the perfect complement to the steaks we were eating. soo good!!! potatoes were a bit too runny for me, i like the fluffiness of potatoes, not when it's too liquefied.   dessert: cheesecake (yum!!), chocolate ganache (meh), fruit platter (nothing to write home about), and gelato (i've had better)  after our meal, we had a lot of leftovers and they were just as good the next day as when we were eating it right from the kitchen.  waitstaff: very very attentive and worked like a great team should  *** negative 1 star. idk what it was but my stomach was not feeling good. i finished my first drink from the bar and i felt fine. i then had a glass of wine but after ONLY a couple sips, i started feeling out of it. i requested to send it back. he asked if i would rather have another drink but i told him that  i'm done drinking for the night until i felt better so i said i'll stick to the water. after apologizing, i was expecting something to be taken off the bill, only to see them coming out with two glasses of champagne. WTF!? i said i was done drinking........ why in the world would they bring out alcoholic beverages?? i didn't drink it. dumba*s",

We had a reservation and were sat within minutes of arriving.  The wait staff encouraged the tasting menu (to the point of being aggressive about it). We went with their suggestion which turned out to be a great decision. We received 6 apps, 6 steaks, 6 sides and 6 desserts. The portions were generous and everyone got to try everything (we even had some leftovers for the next day).  We had 6 different steaks and everyone choose a different one as their favorite. My personal favorite was the Wagyu strip steak. Perfectly cooked and just melted in my mouth. Every dish was delicious however a couple were a bit boring (grilled asparagus, roasted vegetables, caesar salad).   Overall we had a memorable New Year's Eve dinner and I will be back for another Wagyu strip steak on my next trip to Vegas.",

I shared a rib eye and a hanger steak with my friend. Both were cooked to perfect medium rare. The wine reduction was just right. Sides- salad greens, red peppers, spinach... all good.

We did the Kobe Surf and Turf tasting menu which at $160 a person ain't a cheap date, but the selection and variety was amazing and we left pleasantly stuffed.  We had 3 types of salad and a shrimp cocktail, 3 types of steak, asparagus, the most delicious buttery mashed potatoes, scallops, and lobster, and a litany of delicious desserts. The service at Craftsteak is wonderful... even though you have a total of 4 people serving you, everyone was very attentive and were playful and not stuffy when they realized we were a laidback casual group.

We started with an order of lobster bisque, I had the scallops, my boyfriend had the fillet Mignon and lobster and our side was the golden yukon potato puree.

Everything we had was delicious and I was really surprised how great the potato puree was, we were eating more of that then our main dishes. I wanted to let them know it was his birthday but it was a little too late by the end of our meal, we were way too full and my boyfriend was already really upset with the server so I said forget it!

The server and busboys were all so helpful and friendly and we had quite a lot of questions about the menu and ingredients which they answered all with a smile.    Wonderful!

    "text": "4.5 Stars.  One of my all time favourite steak houses. Located in the MGM at the very back of the casino. Be prepared for a hell of a walk from the strip entrance doors. It's essential to \"bring your appetite\" if your going to brave the tasting menu.  Service is spectacular all around. This is old school service, waiters are in tuxedos that make you feel like your the only one that matters. Very impressive.   They have a great beer that pairs well with Steak. It's called Harviestoun and is aged 15 years in a Highland Park distillery cask. At $30 a pop, it's pricey but a nice treat.   We selected one of the tasting menus - the chef selected domestic Wagyu beef selection at $160 / per person. This included:  - Three different starters. We selected the frisee salad, prosciutto and organic lettuce salad. Top ratings on them all.  - The steak entrees were 1) 8 oz. fillet Mignon and 2) Skirt steak. All cooked medium rare. The beef melted in your mouth. Some of the best steak I ever ate.  - You get 3 side dishes -  I picked 1) brussel sprouts, 2) mixed mushrooms and 3) potato gratin - all amazing again. The brussel sprouts were the stand out with caramelized bacon and prosciutto.   These are all good size portions. I'm stuffed at this point but it's time for the desert course. The waiter arrived with a huge dessert plate with 4 different items -  1) Monkey bread (like a cinnamon bun) , carrot cake, cheese cake and and an ice cream selection.  I have a big appetite, well above average but this was just to much food for a single sitting. Next time I will skip the tasting menu and likely save some money as well.   Overall... Craftsteak has excellent food and service but very pricey. It's worth it in my opinion, once a year on my annual vegas trip.",

I'd had a cheaper and better steak at Ruth's Chris steakhouse.   I was really excited to eat here, big let down.  The bread and the service was excellent. I just don't understand why people think they need to change a classic dish.  My filet's sauce was gross, the mash potatoes were way over blended ( we new this when ordering, but not great), but the Brussel sprouts were really good.   I'd suggest saving your money and go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I had the most tender steak of my life (so far) at CraftSteak. Their four diamond award is well deserved. If you ever visit Las Vegas, CraftSteak is a MUST visit.   There are around four different servers attending to one table, but they weren't the ones who comes every two minutes to ask how your food tastes. We ordered the Chef's Beef Selection: Angus Beef, which was $119 per person, and comes as a three course meal. Let me tell you, it was NOT a three course meal.   First, we were served with the house bread (complimentary), then the most delicious lobster bisque was served, accompanied with 3 different types of salad. Our steak was served in two pans: the filet mignon part of our porterhouse was soooo tender, it really just melted in my mouth. The strip loin area was amazing as well, served with the following side dishes: wild mushrooms, scalloped potatoes, asparagus. (so much food!) Then comes the dessert: passion fruit & coconut sorbet, strawberry oats dusted on lychee sorbet, creme brulee, and OMG the Monkey Bread is to die for! Unfortunately, I was way too stuffed to eat more of the monkey bread, but it's honestly the second favorite part of the meal to the steak.   Note: A lady will come around to the tables asking if you'd like a picture, then she will try to sell the printed pictures to you for $75 (which was not specified in the beginning). We refused to purchase the pictures, and her attitude was horrid after that. I don't think she is part of the CraftSteak Staff because all the other servers were a delight!",

I had to waive a different server down to get my bill. The filet was prepared in a way I wasn't super stoked on, but it tasted good. The sweet potato side was horrible. The potatoes were hard as a rock. To top it off, one of the hostesses said (in a rude manner) I couldn't get in that night and as I was about to walk away, another hostesses who watched our conversation grabbed me and said they had a table. So that was nice, but I should have just gone in.  Overall, very very average, but for that kind of money, not some where I would go again.",

    "text": "We went with a rather large group for my boyfriends birthday in June and had a great experience! I think most of us went with the Wagyu Skirt Steak (medium rare plus for me, thanks). Cooked to perfection - juicy, warm, delish! The side dishes were pretty good also.   Worth mentioning also is the outstanding help we received from both the waitress and the sommelier when trying to select a good, but decently priced bottle of wine (under one hundy!!). We went with one of their recommendations: Veraison Synchrony 2004 (Napa Valley). It is mostly a Cab franc/sauvignon blend with a bit of malbec and merlot. It was very smooth and complemented the steak perfectly!! I looked at my local wine shop and they carry it at $60 a bottle. Considering we payed less than $100 for it, it wasn't too much of a mark up (and you know what I mean... Bottles that cost $10 at Ralphs are sometimes 6 or 7 times that at a restaurant!).  Another thing worth mentioning is that my boyfriend and I stayed at the MGM through the PRIMA deal. This deal entails that you are going to spend $500 through out the MGM Grand resorts and you get special deals like 2 for 1 entrees at the MGM restaurant, 2 for 1 drinks at the bars, free entrance at wet republic, etc. etc. Even though most of our group stayed at the MGM, my boyfriend and I were the only ones that got the PRIMA deal and thought that they would only give us our entrees at 2 for 1. However, they honored it for the WHOLE table (around 8 of us). We saved over $200!!  A GREAT deal!!",

We tried to call the hotel concierge for reservations and were told 10 pm was the next available (it was 6:45) so we decided to walk downstairs. Oddly enough we were seated immediately. I had the Wagyu Ribeye. It was phenomenal. My wife and daughter, the filet. The cut was epic. i've never seen a larger piece. the service was impeccable, i was overall impressed beyond amazement.   On that note......... our total bill was $394.77 including tip, for 3. So as much as i was impressed, it damn well better have been amazing.   final summation, very good value.",

    "text": "Many of you may wonder why I have not been writing as many reviews lately.  Well this is it....I've been saving up to go to craftsteak...not an easy feat on a yoga teacher's salary.  What is the result? I have two words for you: Monkey Bread.  Oh yeah, that's right.  You thought the two words were going to be steak related? Maybe \"Skirt steak\"? Or \"short rib\"? Or \"Rib eye\"?  Ok, that last one is really only one word, but I couldn't think of an amusing third.  NO. You're WRONG.  Where is it at here? Dessert and sides.  Don't get me wrong.....the steak is amazing.  And perfectly cooked.  I had the filet as part of surf and turf, and chose scallops as my surf item.  But really, we've all had an amazing steak and an amazing steak is what you would expect from a place with \"steak\" in the name.  The great dessert, however, was a complete shocker.   I believe I even offered to have babies for the pastry chef, which I hoped would get me an introduction, but instead only got me a \"you're a creepy customer\" giggle.  Oh well.  The ambiance here is pretty good EXCEPT the chairs are horrible.  Really REALLY horrible.  Luckily we were not seated at a center table and instead had at least one side of the table that was up against a bench because my poor baby bro who just had back surgery would have never made it through the night in that chair.  The music was also a little off for me....slightly loud country-ish stuff.  I like country; it just seemed a little out of place here.  Service was beyond great, and all of the servers very quickly realized that we were the \"nice\" kind of customers and were chatting with us and showing us adorable baby pictures.  We actually had two people waiting on us plus another two bus boys filling up water, and my water glass was never empty.  That alone is quite a feat because I drink water like it is going out of style.  In a place like this I always ask the opinion of the waitstaff and they were very happy to guide us toward some amazing choices.  The yukon gold mashed potatoes were so tasty; not too salty, very creamy and buttery and flavorful.  We also had the mixed mushrooms which, when stacked with a small piece of steak, piece of onion, and a dollop of potato made for one of the most perfect bites I have ever eaten.  The scallops were also amazing but the lobster was a real surprise.  The best lobster I've had has not been in steakhouses....it usually seems to be on the beach after being freshly caught and after I am freshly inebriated.  But this lobster was off-the-charts good. So of course the lobster bisque was great as well.  The breakdown: Service: 5 stars Chairs: 0 stars Music: 2 stars Yukon Mashed Potatoes: 5 stars Mushrooms: 5 stars Lobster Bisque: 4.5 stars Roasted Red Pepper Salad: 4 stars Lobster: 4.5 stars Scallops: 4.5 stars Filet: 4 stars Monkey Bread: 10 billion stars.   Complicated computer calculation outcome: 4.483 stars  I will likely never be able to afford to come here again after dropping more than 300 bucks for all of the above plus a half a bottle of wine...but that is ok.  I still have the memories.  And for at least another 12 hours, the leftovers in the fridge.",

    "text": "I pretty much just had the best steak of my entire freakin life.  Came here for the bf's birthday. Weren't quite sure what to order so we went with the domestic wagyu surf & turf which came with lobster bisque, 3 choices of salad, new york strip, ribeye, 3 choices of sidedishes and dessert all for about $160 per person.   Lobster bisque: Took a sip and was transported to heaaavvveeennn!!! The bisque was just so creamy and smooth with little bits of lobster meat in it and I also think a slight hint of curry? Who knows. Who cares. It was freakin delicious.   Salad: Caesar, market spinach, wild arugula. Caesar is your typical caesar with anchovy.. interesting but tasty. The market spinach would have to have been my favorite. I thought the port wine really complemented the spinach, apples, and walnuts. The wild arugula was alright I guess.. nothing special.   New York Strip & Ribeye: Honestly a baby could have eaten this. Why? Because its melt-in-your-mouth steak. First bite and you probably only chew 2-3 times. Yes. It is that good. Between the two I would have to favor the new york strip just because it was probably less chewy. Both were done in a medium rare.  Sides: Baby spinach, Mushroom assortment, potato puree. yum yum triple yum! All three of the side dishes were pretty much done perfectly. And I'm sure all their other sides are done just as well so I guess pick whichever you like. You won't be disappointed!  Dessert: Cinnamon monkey bread, fruit platter, espresso chocolate & raspberry sorbet?? Forgot. Anyways, I'm not a big fan of cinnamon but the monkey bread only had a hint of cinnamon so still quite tasty. I heard thats their number 1 dessert. The sorbet and the fruit platter were tasty as well.   Overall this place was excellent. The staff were helpful and friendly and very attentitive. All our close-to-empty water glasses were filled promptly. Ambiance was nice as well. Of course I will be coming back!!!................... once I soak up the pool of tears I cried after seeing the bill.. heh. heh.   Oh, I also heard that the dress code was business casual but honestly I saw people in their wearing sweats so I'm sure a t-shirt and jeans are fine. They won't turn you away if you have the money ya know what I mean?",

    "text": "One of my top five dining experiences ever. Lovely restaurant atmosphere, spectacular and attentive service, an impressive single malt scotch list, and a delicious meal. A quick rundown of what we ordered:   GF: Half-dozen assorted oysters, lobster bisque soup, 14 oz Wagyu skirt steak, potato puree Me: Butternut squash soup w/ maple glazed bacon, 10 oz black angus filet mignon, cheddar grits with some more maple glazed bacon, glass of (fairly priced!!) Dalmore 15  We would order every single one of those items again, if given the chance. The food was expertly prepared and extremely tender, to the point where I barely had to chew during the meal. At a steakhouse, that's a feat.  Special nod to our server, Kevin, who was friendly, informative, and entertaining.  Yes, this is a pricey place, but you're paying for quality, and it's worth every penny. We'll definitely return... after our bank accounts refill a bit.",

    "text": "We went to Craftsteak in January 2012.  The food does not live up to the hype and in fact my steak was literally one of the worst I have ever had.  Starting with the beet salad.  Was a.o.k.  Not inventive or interesting,  I make a better beet salad as does every restaurant in Seattle that I have ordered one at.  But, you can't really screw up beets.  Husbands fillet:  He said it was fine.  I ordered the rib-eye.  I do not eat steaks often, so when I do, I go for a rib-eye.  I ordered it medium well.  The steak came out very bloody.  They took it back and recooked it, came out the second time, bloody.  They took it back and recooked it for the third time and then brought out a steak that resembled a piece of leather.    In Seattle, I have ordered medium well rib-eyes at El Gaucho, Ruth Chris, The Capital Grille, Daniels Broiler and The Met, all of which understand how to cook a medium well steak.  Sweet potatoes:  I actually liked this dish until my husband said it tasted like canned pumpkin pie filling.  He was exactly right.  I happen to like pumpkin pie, so this worked, however I would bet that no sweet potato or yam made it in to this dish.  Our experience here was very disappointing.  Save your money or try somewhere else.  This place is surviving on the hype, not on good food.    Tom Colicchio, pack your knives and go.",

    "text": "Tom, Tom, Tom...(sigh)  I am an avid food enthusiast & regularly watch your show (Top Chef) and admire how you critically pin-point flaws/perfection in hundreds of dishes through-out your career.  I'll keep it short & sweet (maybe a little sharp too)...  1.) SCALLOPS ($40) - Best dish, perfect sear, cooked just enough to retain the moisture in the scallop.  The beurre blanc sauce or what not could've used a bit of thickening but still was delicious.  I really enjoyed the accompanying pickled white onions that came with.  I truly and thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  2.) RISOTTO ($14) - About 3-5% overcooked.  Yet, still tasty.  The pine nuts accent the risotto & parmesan and work well together.  And although it was tasty I felt it could've used more of a kick.  Risotto is something I really love eating, especially when it has a somewhat addictive flavor that leaves you wanting more.  Now that I've said that, on to the steaks:  3.) DOMESTIC RIBEYE ($50) - Visually stunning especially when plated in the metal pan carrying all the delicous jous.  However, by the time I got to my steak, which was a perfect med-rare, it was tough and just inedible.  (Maybe I should mention I had been just getting over a cold.  However, I dont think this should alter my taste judgement too much because the first two appetizers were tasting mighty fine.)  I really wanted to like it, and I just couldn't get less than half of it down.  4.) DOMESTIC WAGYU RIBEYE ($105) - Again, Visually stunning.  It tasted like a cross between a fatty short rib & a ny strip.  However, and AGAIN, texture failed, it was warm to cold and barely was edible.  More-so edible than the previous mention, but still not worth nearly what it costed.  I really dont wan't to say this, but goto Outback and order a \"teriyaki ribeye\" and you'd enjoy that 7 times more than this...I feel depressed now.  Anyway, all in all, I wouldn't go back.  I honestly wanted to like it..REALLY I DID. Perhaps next time I will attempt Jean Georges Steakhouse or another variety.  I will probably never enter another Tom Colicchio restaurant ever again due to the severity of this incidental experience.  First and last time for Tom Colicchio as far as I'm concerned.  Sorry Tom, I tried.  If it means anything, you're (probably) still a very good chef (Tom Colicchio).  TOTAL BILL: $235",

The dry aged ribeye (med-rare) is consistently cooked to perfection (slightly bloody) and the flavor always gets high marks.  The only real questionhere  is what sides to get.   The sauteed mushroom variety is surprisingly good but the dinner rolls are enough to fill you up before the steak.

But being a steakhouse, first and foremost, I feel my steak didn't wow me.  My New York wasn't seared very much and the presentation made it feel like it was just a massive side dish.  Seasoning could've been better and it just ended up a chore to eat.  Also, I've never really been a fan of a high-end steakhouse slicing your steak for you.  It gets cold too fast and deprives me of the exercise.  ;)  A bit disappointed with the steak here, Tom Colicchio!  Here's what *did* work for me @ Craftsteak: -Daily oysters.  Fresh, GREAT horseradish and thank you for letting us order less than a dozen!  I'm usually the only one that likes raw oysters in my party, so doing a dozen would be like a full meal for me.  Most places won't even consider doing a half dozen.  Kudos! -Seared scallops -mushroom and prosciutto risotto - i did WORK on this side. -brussle sprouts w/ bacon(!!) -the free bread.  they look like those hawaiian sweet rolls you get from lucky's but they were surprisingly good.  Warm and toasted with a bit of salt on top to counter the sweetness of the bread.  nice. -my long island iced tea was solid.  actually both of them were...  In conclusion, the overall dining experience here will bring me back.  Unfortunately, I won't be having another steak here for a while.  I will, however, check out the famous braised short rib next time.",

The steaks are quite big, so between the 2 of us we usually get a NY Strip, or Ribeye. Marvin is one of the, if not the best server I've had in all of my trips. I love seeing him, and you can see he genuinely cares about who he is serving, and the food he serves.  Fantastic wine list, has everything you can think of, and of every price range.   I am not a big dessert person, so I always go for the sorbet. The coffee comes in little french presses! Very nice!  Yes, it is expensive, but I would want this as my last meal.

    "text": "We recently visited Craftsteak in the MGM Grand.  Overall, everything was top notch.  Service:  The service staff was efficient and professional.  They felt more professional than most, ditching the hyped up sexiness for quality sophistication.  These people actually seem serious about their jobs.  Food:  The food was great.  We kept things pretty simple ... an assortment of mushrooms, sauteed spinach and porterhouse for two (which came with bone marrow as well).  The mushrooms were heavenly and the rest of the meal was excellent.  The only thing you need to decide for yourself is one of price.  If you are not willing to spend $200 on dinner for two or find that price generally outrageous, then there's not much I can say.   Otherwise, get ready for a great meal and experience.",

    "text": "This was a pretty disappointing experience.  I started out with the mixed lettuce greens expecting some kind of salad but it was just some lettuce mixed with a little oil and vinegar.  I guess they are trying to go with some kind of simple thing but that was too simple.  They gave these little rolls which were decent enough except for the bit of salt on top which you just easily sweep off.  For my main course I had a skirt steak.  It was cooked properly and it was fine.  I could do just as well making one at home.  They really push the kobe/wagyu dishes heavy when you sit down but they dont deserve my business for their $40 steak, Im going to buy $100 steaks from them?  I think not.  I dont remember what I had for dessert.  Probably nothing special since I dont remember it.    This place isnt what you come to Vegas for.  The lettuce thing was kind of a joke and didnt start things off well.",

Being that it was just my wife and I they placed us in a nice table not too close to anyone else.  The meal was incredible.  We chose the summer tasting menu with the wine pairing.  It was unbelievable.  For the person who commented on the mozzarella salad not being a salad, they just don't know what they're talking about.  Everything was what it said it was, other people just don't know food.  Also, the wine pairing was great.  We do not usually like white wine, but they pair one with the appetizer course that was very good.  Aside from the dinner itself, the service was top-notch.  We had a team of two waiters helping us that night.  So someone was never too far away.  They were both very knowledgeable, attentive and respectful.  Overall, there was no part of the meal that was anything less than stellar. I recommend it to the fullest.",

    "text": "I'm not even sure what I can say about Craftsteak that hasn't been said. This place has AWESOME food. It's totally worth every penny, like everyone says. My husband and I had the fall/winter tasting menu ($70/pp) which you have to now ask for (it was that popular that they don't talk about it on their menus anymore, so be sure and ask!) and you literally get to try everything they mention on the menu. I've never been anywhere that did that before, usually you have to choose your \"app, entree & dessert\" out of a few choices. It was great to be able to try it all! The wait service was one of the best I've had at any restaurant in my life. They kept bringing out more and more food, I couldn't believe it! Definitely a place where you get the most bang for your buck. We had 4 salads (a fennel salad, mozzarella salad, quail and cranberry salad, and a cucumber salad), 3 entrees (two kinds of steak, both cooked perfectly, and giant scallops, also cooked perfectly), 3 sides (the great potato puree everyone talks about, some awesome braised brussel sprouts, and braised mushroom medley), and two desserts (lava cake and monkey bread). I've never eaten so much in my life, but it was so worth it. Also, the hostess heard me mention (totally off-hand, she asked why we were in Vegas) that it was our anniversary, and they gave us the lava cake as an extra dessert for our anniversary (complete with \"happy anniversary\" piped on the plate in chocolate, yum!) What awesome service! I highly recommend Craftsteak for the service, the ambiance (nice low-lit booths, very romantic), and OF COURSE the food. Eat here if you can! :) Definitely in my top 5 best meals of all time.",

    "text": "No no no. Overrated  & of course being vegas, over priced as well. black jack tables at the hard rock have tempered with more mercy than the marauding craftsteak.  The 300% mark up on the Cabernet suggested by their sommelier, was heavy on the lactic acid tip, and  i found it offensive that this wine was suggested in the 1st place.   the asparagus was soggy, mushrooms - banal, & the risotto was bland & hardly enough to share with a group. my grilled kobe wagyu rib eye was a generous portion, cooked perfectly to my desire (medium rare), and indeed delicious. but not $105 delicious.  to craftsteaks defense, i was informed by my friend who is a head chef at a bistro in L.A., that the wagyu steaks were priced appropriately.  while i respect & appreciate the care & effort taken to yield quality beef, i find it absurdly overrated & not worth the type of coin that restaurants want for wagyu beef.   the dessert menu is full of recycled choices with pithy names like monkey bread (a cinnamon roll).  none of the items we tried were anything special.   all in all, craftsteaks food will fail to blow you away, but with the exception of the sommelier, the service was exceptional from the host, to our waiter, to our busser.",

We red some great reviews and decided we would spend a good sum of money on a great meal. Excellent service is the first thing i noticed. Our waitress was very attentive and recommended some great ideas. As soon as plates were brought out she was quick to give great descriptions of each meal. My friends and I decided to get the Tastes of Winter which was listed on the exterior of the restaurant. Our waitress also highly recommended this meal and also let us know that it was a great value in comparison to other menu items. Appetizers included the beet salad, scallops, and prawns which were all great, and all of us were able to sample a few of each item. Next was the Filet Mignon and Steak. The Filet was the most tender Filet i have ever had, and everything was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Lastly was our Dessert Sampler platter. We revived about 5 different items. One included the amazing Monkey Bread. I recommend that everyone try Craftsteak at least once in their lifetime.",

He chose Craftsteak seeing as he had already been to Cut in LA.  We sat down for dinner and the customer service was on point.  The waiters were beyond helpful.  My fiance and I decided to split the meal since we had a large lunch earlier in the day.  So I took a look at the menu and immediately honed in on the lobster bisque.  We ordered that up as well as the T bone, shitake mushrooms, and yukon gold potato puree with chives.  The restaurant kindly split our meal for us at no extra charge.  The bisque came out pipin' hot and had large chunks of lobster in it.  There was no skimpin' involved.  Following the bique was our entree.  It was soo freakin' good and couldn't even finish all of it.  The staff packed up our little doggy bag.  After dinner the man and I went out for drinks and strolled in around 3am.  I start to get ready for bed and discover my fiance had devoured all the leftovers.  Now I know never leave him alone with a steak dinner doggy bag.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a very long time. We both love a good steak and I am a huge Top Chef fan, so we decided that for our 10 year anniversary we would finally see (taste) what everyone was talking about. I made the reservation about 2 months ahead of time online so that was not a problem. The night of our visit (4/30), we ran into the \"cab line from hell\" so we called to let them know we were running late. They were friendly and said it should not be a problem. When we arrived less than 5 minutes late for our reservation we were greeted and told that it would be a couple of minutes. We waited over 20 minutes to be seated as they were very busy. The \"reservationless\" people that inquired about tables were told that none were available until 10:30 PM (it was 8PM at the time).  Once seated in a very nice area of the dining room (don't sit in the bar unless you have to) we were promptly greeted by both of our waiters. We quickly ordered drinks and were served the delicious rolls and butter that everyone else has mentioned. They are delish- I tried to avoid eating my 3 before my meal arrived, but they were so good I could not resist (also I would have been really starving had I waited, but more on that later). I ordered that Black Cherry Fizz and my husband had a Captain Morgan (Private Stock) and Coke. Both drinks were great. Our waiter gave us a very thorough explanation of the menu, especially the 3-course section. We decided on the 10oz filet for me and the 6oz filet and half lobster for my husband, as well as the fried zucchini blossom on the side.  So began the wait, and some more wait, and more wait. The staff was friendly and attentive, but nobody said anything like\"sorry it is taking so long\", etc. In all, I believe our meal did not arrive until 40 minutes after we ordered. It seemed like all the tables around us were waiting just as long, so maybe that is just how they do service there. We had not ordered any appetizers or a 1st course so we were starving.  Now for the good stuff-the food was great! Both steaks were cooked exactly to order-rare and medium rare and tasted wonderful. My husband's lobster was excellent also. The only thing we did not \"love\" was the zucchini blossom. It was truly fried and a bit too greasy. The tomato aioli dipping sauce was a nice accent though. We ate every bite of our meals and so we were too full for dessert (the selection looked great).However, one of the the food runners brought us each a plate of 4 mini chocolate pies with pieces of carmelized pineapple on top. Wow- that was absolutely great. Maybe because it was not expected, but also it was a very tasty dessert and I usually only order Creme Brulee or an ice cream dessert. There was no charge for the dessert so I think that they gave it to us because I had mentioned in the online reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary.  Overall we had a very excellent experience at Craftsteak. The plus side was the food. The downside was the extensive wait time to sit and to eat. We would probably only go back for another special occasion since it is very expensive (my hubby wouldn't even let my see the bill), but we knew that going in. I am still a big Tom Colicchio fan and am glad to have shared the Craftsteak exprience!",

    "text": "After hearing many rave reviews, my girlfriend and I decided to try Craftsteak. We were looking for a nice, romantic night out, but unfortunately it did not go exactly as planned. Although we had made reservations a few days ahead, we were seated  30 minutes late and in the bar area .  We had people's butts constantly shoved in our face, not exactly conducive to our \"romantic atmosphere. Now for the food, I must say I was a bit disappointed as well, although it was still worth trying. We ordered a Caesar salad, the waygu skirt steak, the braised short ribs, the potatoes au gratin, and fried zucchini. The Caesar was weak at best and could have come from any other steak house in the country. Both meat courses were cooked perfectly and the portions were very respectable. For the price however, I would have expected more.  My disappointment was more with the side dishes. The potatoes were not cooked as thoroughly as I would have liked and rather bland, and then the zucchini was downright bad. The zucchini was overcooked and over battered, and the tomato aioli was pretty much straight mayonnaise. Now, looking back, it would appear that my review is a bit negative because we did actually have a  good time, and I would still tentatively recommend Craftsteak. In the end it was actually quite good, I have just had so much better, and at the prices they charge, I was expecting to have the best.",

    "text": "I was in Las Vegas for a bachelorette party last weekend. We were excited for our first night out and a fancy dinner. Our salads were delicious and that's where the good stops. I decided to splurge and order the ribeye which is $50 a la carte and goes against my whole being because that is a ridiculous price. I thought \"hey why not it's vegas?\" I ordered my steak rare....it was overcooked and not seasoned well at all. I ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes with rosemary. I got little baby potatoes with a couple sprigs of rosemary on top. It was like one of those horrible dishes your grandmother throws together to make dinner seem fancy. It was very hard to hand over my portion of the bill when at home I can go down the street and order a 16oz Ribeye that comes with a baked potato and side salad for $9.95 (and it's the best damn steak I've ever had); I actually went there when I flew in to cheer up.   Out of 5 of us only one liked their dinner; which happened to be the bachelorette so we were happy. Another one of us ordered the beef tartar and it came with something like bagel chips instead of a sliced baguette. When she asked the server if they had a sliced baguette she looked at her like she was insane; left for maybe a minute and then came back saying \"they just couldn't do it\".  VERY RUDE!   We ended up taking our leftovers hoping we would see a homeless person to give them to.   We also thought it was ironic that the owner of this restaurant is so judgemental on his show, yet this was a terrible dinner.",

    "text": "I like beef. Bloody, tender, flavorful beef. On a random Sunday night in Vegas my lovely lady friend and I headed to Craftsteak and took a seat at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready. We were early and they were busy, which meant we would entertain ourselves with some adult beverages.  I'm allergic to most hard liquor, but I can drink Ciroc. The bartender was happy to cater to my allergy and discerning taste by whipping up a martini that was strong and slightly sweet. He delivered with a tasty beverage with just the right amount of peach juice and vodka.  Once we were seated the service was fantastic, quick (but not too quick) and attentive. We asked our server how to properly stuff our faces with just the right beef selection that would cater to our needs. I ordered the \"surf and turf\" while my friend got the skirt steak. We started off with fried goat cheese, and ordered some garlic mashies on the side. My 6oz petite filet was cooked perfectly medium-rare. My lobster was juicy. The skirt steak was cooked a little longer to my friends preference, and the meat juice that filled the bottom of her skillet was HEAVENLY. Once we ate every single bit of our steaks, we happily dipped our spoonfulls of mashed potatoes in said meat juice.  I'm still dreaming about that combo.  Screw the whole \"Top Chef\" reference. Go for the beef, mashies, and meat juice!  Pricing was very reasonable. For two entrees, one side, one app, and 3 adult beverages we spent around $250. For once I felt like I was paying for the food and not the ambiance, though the low lights and romantical feeling of the place was great. I'd take my husband back anytime, but only if he promises to share.",

For example, rather than bringing you a carrot the size of a baby's arm, or a potato the size of a football, like \"some\" steak houses do, they bring you fresh veggies that actually taste good. The corn is not to be missed.  The mashed potatoes are the best in the world.  The entrees too are excellent. Try the salmon for a change of pace.  The elegance of the room, the bar and the crowd set the mood for a fantastic dining experience. Oh yeah, this place is owned by Tom Colichio from Top Chef. No wonder he became a reality star!!",

    "text": "Just wanted to let you know about my experience at CraftSteak, February 18. To begin with I am a big fan of Colicchio and Top Chef. No, I did not have expectations of meeting him, I know that with chains you don't really meet the actual chef. I did however, have expectations of having a well cooked meal and good service. Especially at a restaurant where the owner judges other chefs on things that his own people cannot follow through on themselves.    It was my husbands and my anniversary(my b-day and our anniversary are 2 days apart, not that it's relevant) and we were seeing a show. We had not decided where we would have dinner since earlier plans fell through. We did not have reservations but upon reading the menu, we decided to have dinner at CraftSteak. We were seated immediately in the lounge area by the walkway which was nice for people watching. Anyway, the busboy greeted us before the server but maybe this is the standard, no big deal. When the server did come and take our drink order, we didn't order wine because we were going to a show and didn't want any alcohol. Again, no issues. But for some reason, we got a different server. Again, no issues. We ordered dinner, everything was fine, although a little slow with water/soda refills. Still, no issues, we're not that picky. The first course came out, it was delicious. My husband had the shrimp cocktail and I had the quail. Both were fantastic. Then our steaks were served. This is where everything went downhill. My husband the ribeye cooked med-rare. It came out more on the med side but he ate it, said it was flavorful but the rosemary flavor was at times overpowering. It also had a lot of fat. Actually, about a quarter of his $50 steak was fat. I had the hanger steak, ordered rare. It was cooked med-well. The server didn't come back to see if everything was okay, I actually had to flag down the busboy to get her to the table. She said she would have it recooked. I asked that she give me a time frame since we were going to a show and were short on time. She didn't do this. She just brought the steak out and left. She didn't check back again to see if everything was ok. The steak was cooked blue. Not rare,..blue. At that point, I was done. Sadly, the highlight of the dinner were the appetizers and our side item which was sugar snap peas. Not the steaks or the service. The restaurants busy, I actually saw our server chatting by the computers with the other server. It would have been more forgiving if the server was busy. So for a dinner of $180.00 with tip, I expected more. Not the moon but more. Especially from a well known restaurant.   I did give it 2 stars because the 1st course and the bread were good but they weren't $180 good.",

    "text": "Went here with a group of guys and we decided to do the pre fix menu. It wasn't an ordinary one, the way the waiter described it was that the more people that order this, the more variety of food he would bring out. We got to try 6 different types of steak cuts and got 6 different sides as well as a crapton of dessert. By the end we were so full. The steak itself I don't think was too special, the corn was really good. So if you are coming here just for steak and not with a big group, I'd probably pass. However if you want to have fun with a big group and eat, this is a great place for that",

    "text": "This was my first trip to Vegas since turning 21 so I wanted to go out to an amazing restaurant while I was there. I am a big Top Chef fan and wanted to try Tom Colicchio's restaurant knowing it would be awesome considering how high his standards are.   I went in with high expectations to this dinner and let me just say that this restaurant surpassed my expectations. I can't say enough good things about my experience at Craftsteak.   First, we had the chilled oysters. AMAZING. I wanted 100 more of them! If you're a seafood person like myself then starting off with these is an excellent choice. They are light and won't fill you up.   I had read on Craftsteak's website that the lobster bisque was one of their signature items and now I know why. Wow. It was mouth watering. Hands down one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life and I've eaten some pretty amazing food. I was blown away. You can't come to this restaurant and not order this item.   For my entree, I ordered the flat iron steak. It was cooked to perfection, no surprise there. I could have cut my steak with my fork; that's how tender it was. It was absolutely delicious. But what really blew me away was the risotto. I could eat that risotto every day for the rest of my life. They should put the risotto as one of their signature items if they haven't already.   Aside from the spectacular food, the service was IMPECCABLE. Our server was so kind, so efficient, and just wonderful. Not only was our server terrific, but the busser and the person who ran out the food to us were so polite and nice as well. I've never had such good service before. We got drinks at the bar before our dinner and the bartenders were awesome as well.   Also, the ambiance is lovely. I loved the interior.   I wanted an amazing dinner in Vegas and that was what I got and then some. Tom Colicchio has high standards as a judge on Top Chef and those high standards show in his restaurant as well. This was the best dinner I've ever had in my life and I cannot wait to go back and eat here again. It was a very expensive dinner but it was completely worth every penny.",

    "text": "Craftsteak is a fairly typical but very well executed steakhouse.  It's a bit more expensive than comparable restaurants since it's in Vegas, but the atmosphere is nice, the service is great, and the food is delicious.  Warm Frisee - If you want something healthy, look elsewhere.  Despite being a salad, this is more of a cheese and bacon explosion.  Very rich and tasty, but definitely not light either.  Organic Lettuce Salad - This salad, on the other hand, is very light and refreshing with a lemon vinaigrette.  Made for a nice contrast to the heavier items we ordered.  Side of Brussels Sprouts - Again, despite being a vegetable dish, is very rich.  Very good smoky bacon flavor though.  Brussels sprouts can sometimes get a bit gummy especially when cooked in this much oil, but these retained a great firm texture and were very well cooked.  16oz. Roasted N.Y. Strip Steak - Cooked perfectly rare.  While some other high-end steakhouses often cook in butter, leaving a rich but distinctly buttery note, the steak here seemed to be cooked differently and really lets the flavor of the meat speak for itself.  Definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had, not much else to say.  Fruit Platter - Really hit the spot after having so much heavy food.  Lots of very fresh and less common fruits.  Beautiful presentation and a great finisher for the meal.  Very straightforward restaurant.  If you want an excellent steak in a classy environment, this is a great option.",

    "text": "So we have dined at Mastros, Flemings, Ruth Chris... Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at the MGM is right up there if not better.   To start, the service was great. We started at the bar and the bartender was quick to serve with a nice pour. At the table, our server was very attentive and informative. It felt like we had a team of severs. Our drinks never went dry.   The food, I went with the 18 oz Ribeye (but of course) and it did not disappoint. I can't remember the last time I've had such a perfectly cooked ribeye that was as flavorful without being extra fatty. I wanted to throw the bone in my pocket and save it for later. Great options for sides. However, we were fortunate enough to be friends with a chef and had a couple additional sides (compliments of the chef ) if you are only having one or two sides, do yourself a favor and don't skip on the Warm Frisee Salad (hands down best side of the night). I also heard the Lobster Bisque was quite tasty.   Dessert, oh man, we were celebrating a birthday and the chef did not hold back. The only thing I regret is having to eat in a hurry because we had a show to catch so we flew threw dessert.   The atmosphere was the standard dark wood, low lit steakhouse feel and even though the restaurant was very busy it was still quiet enough to enjoy conversation without having to raise your voice across the table.   Bottom line, if you're doing a steakhouse in Vegas, you need to give Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak a try. You won't regret it.  My first Yelp review! It was that good!! I just had to.",

    "text": "Craftsteak is not for the faint of stomach or faint of wallet. This place will stuff you like a teddy bear n break your bank like the IRS.   Parking:  Your in Vegas get a ride!  Decor:  You can definitely see the quality in all their furniture and the cleanliness is uncanny. They had just the perfect amount of dim lighting throughout which really sets a nice ambiance in the place. ONLY complaint is that the tables are close together. I mean the table next to us was thrown off when i kept switching between my normal voice and my British accent. I appreciate the support but I feel like I could have put my fork in their steak at times.   Service:  The service was outstanding. I forgot our servers name but she was part of (Team 5)- that's what it said on our receipt. But they are extremely organized and in unison with everything they do here. On top of that with the pricing in the staff is very personal and doesn't omit a False level of sophistication which is awesome. Biggest thing was everything was cleared and brought out within minutes of each other.    Food:  So I will start off by saying papa bear spared no expense on this one and went for the Chef's Choice (Kobe Menu) $155 a person. That came with unlimited bread, 4 appetizers, 3 Wagyu Steaks, 3 Sides, & 4 Desserts. (This was for a part of 3 people)  Appetizers:  Prosciutto: Honestly was good but not great. Probably the worst thing I had that night. It had some great natural oils in; however I feel it was missing a little density in it, which I think is just my preference when it comes to prosciutto.   Cocktail Shrimp: Man these things were huge, like Shaq's toe huge. They were extremely fresh, cleaned perfectly and delicious. Best part for me they made their cocktail sauce in house.   Caesar Salad w/ Anchovies Ok to start if you don't like Anchovies you'd probably want to stay away. They defiantly use the fresh choves in their dressing. I personally loved it, as well the croutons they used with the salad were awesome. They weren't salty at all which is awesome because it set a great counter balance of the salt from the anchovies in the dressing. As well the romaine was fresh and the fresh Parmesan cheese was the closer on this girl.   Shaved Fennel Salad w/ Poached Egg This would not be for everyone, luckily I'm not everyone. The fennel balanced with the poached egg was oh so dank. On top of that the server literally tosses it right in front of you. I took a slomo video of this and it might be one of the most x rated videos i own. The best part about the whole thing, BOOM they put bacon in it. Oh so grateful for such an addition to the dish.   SIDES: Brussels W/ Bacon Done to perfection and the most impressive thing about this dish was the consistency of the Brussels. If you really look at the picture they stayed fully intact and had the perfect body to them. Not going to lie, they were way better then any one I've ever made.   Pureed Potatoes:  Ok so when you look at this, it literally looks like a porridge dish that my great grandma would eat! But no joke like for real. Once you slap that spoon in your mouth it literally taste like what the holidays make you feel like. It had the right amount of butter and creamy taste without messing with the integrability of the potato. This would by far be the best basic potato dish I've ever had. In my life.   Red Pepper Risotto with Buffalo Mozzarella:  Well this is a dish that I will forever remember. I don't want to lie to you but I would honestly go back for this. Creamy, Savory. It really is the Best Risotto me and my friends have ever had. N let's be for real they got the fresh mozzarella on there. Whoever designed this dish had me in their heart because I am seriously in love with it. Like so good have it at my wedding good.   Steaks Wagyu   New York 14 oz.  2nd favorite: Cooked to perfection with an amazing char on the exterior of it. The body was juicy and supple. Oh ya n the steak was good 2 ;)The sheer density of the meat was everything I wanted it to be.   Skirt 14oz ###!1111111. OK I'm a fatty type of guy when it comes to meat n I don't mean and disrespect to what they do with everything here but this was award winning. I could seriously have this as my last meal on earth n die a happy man. Like goodness the flavor packed into this skirt makes me question what type of illegal things they're doing in the kitchen. Bob Marley really said it \"Is this love Is this love that I'm feeling\". The answer is yes, yes it is!!  Filet 8oz 3rd favorite overall a great filet n the very flavorful for the leanest cut of meat.   Dessert:   Bread Pudding with Almonds Favorite dessert I've ever had in the world. I cant even talk about it cause it gets me excited. Just try it  Lemon Caramel Cheesecake Flan & cheesecake had a baby!!  3 Ice creams: Mango, Apple Cider, Hibiscus The cider ice cream! All I want 2 say  Chocolate Moose Creamy rich and a perfect moose  \"Get It While It's Good Cause Don't Nothing Last Forever\"",

    "text": "AMAZING!!! That is the only word that I can use to describe this place. From the service to the food and everything else in between. This place is just that good. For starters, my friend and I didn't make a reservation. We showed up closer to closing but the staff was very accommodating. They sat us at the bar and that worked out best for us. The bartender catered to our every need and the wait for the food wasn't long at all. Customer service was top notch and there was never a dull moment that wasn't filled with good conversation. It was like there was someone there on staff that would talk to us about literally anything.   I like to try all kinds of different foods when I'm on vacation and this was no exception. For starters I tried the Wagyu Tartare and Fresh Oysters. The Tartare was like butter on the crostini. The oysters tasted like they just came out of the ocean, that fresh! Definitely a must get next time I eat here. For the main course I had the 18oz bone in ribeye. I must say they definitely know how to cook a steak. Most times I eat at steakhouses I end up saying to myself that I can cook a better steak, but not this place. I'll say this place has my approval for steak doneness. They cooked my steak to PERFECT medium rare. Most times I end up sending a steak back because they overcook/undercook it. I also added scallops to the dish, they were fine. I probably wouldn't get it again but I would recommended to someone if they find themselves considering it. To finish out the main course I added some sides. Asparagus, Wild Mushrooms and Potato Puree. Those mushrooms had a vast array of different types adding flavors and textures you don't get from the classic button mushroom dishes. To round it up I had the Pecan Sticky Bun and ice cream. Out of everything, this was probably my least favorite part of the meal. But that was mainly due to me not paying attention to what kind of ice cream that came with it. To balance the sweetness from the bun, they have a sour cream ice cream that goes along. It wasn't bad, it tasted much closer to frozen yogurt and I wasn't expecting that tartness.   All in all I enjoyed my experience dining here. Yes, it does cost a little more but you definitely get what you pay for. The service and experience will make up for price tag. The best part, I left full and satisfied. I didn't pay all this money and was still hungry after the fact. I will be making a return trip to this restaurant the next time I'm in town. No doubt about it.",

Overpriced and decidedly mediocre, i had a steak done at \"chef's choice\" assuming that wouldn't be roasted to maximum heat containment, but boy was it a tough piece of overdone meat. They quickly recovered with better than average service with a new  piece of meat, but despite better cook temperature, The meat itself was not on par with the pricetag. There are too many good options in Vegas to settle for a mediocre meal.",

    "text": "I'll start with the positives: We were seated promptly for our reservation, on time, even though there were a lot of people waiting to be seated. The atmosphere was pretty good. I am very picky about my martini, and it was perfect!    I ordered the 10 oz filet mignon, and it was nice and juicy. I would have preferred a little more seasoning. It was over cooked, as I asked for medium, but there was zero pink.  I asked for the peppercorn sauce and waited quite a while for it. That was very good. The potato puree side I ordered was extremely watery and flavorless.   I forgot to mention that the waiter was extremely pushy, and I finally excepted his salad recommendation, although I was not even hungry enough. I don't remember the name of the salad, but it was terrible and I sent it back.  It was mostly lettuce, lots of lettuce, and some of it had brown edges. The dressing was nasty. Pungent.    Let me reiterate that the waiter was very pushy. I feel like there must be good compensation for up-selling the customer. It was very uncomfortable.    When the check came I felt like the meal was worth about half of what it cost.",

My steak was a good NY strip and he had porterhouse he enjoyed. However when it came time to take leftovers a bag boxes and plasticware were dumped on the table breaking the spell of superior service. For a $300+ dinner for two people why am I boxing up my own stuff? It immediately went for five star to low rent. Carry through service levels to the end or risk a bad taste in our mouths. A warning to all don't think you can get out of here for less than 300 bucks for two people either fixed price or a la carte. I'd say it's a good dinner  but the prices and markup were a bit steep for what you get.",

For what a skirt steak is, this was so perfectly cooked and tender. Hands down best skirt steak I've ever had. Wagyu ribeye was very good but would've been better had they kept it medium rare instead of medium. But for $40 price difference on the a la carte menu I'd stick with the skirt steak. From salads to sides, everything was on point. Potato puree was awesome as suggested by waiter. But what separates a good meal from a great one is dessert. For two ppl, it was dessert overload. Awesome meal even if it was a bit pricey.",

(There are plenty of other reviews covering our Shenanigans)  At any rate they won me over from the start because they carry Hudson River Whiskeys' line of fine whiskeys including, the Baby Bourbon. That immediately got the night off to a great start!   I started off with the Lobster Bisque which was excellent! One of the best I've had with a generous serving of Lobster. The bisque was prepared excellently. Then I got right down to business with my 20 oz Bone-In Ribeye with Blue Cheese. I ordred it medium-rare and it also was prepared excellently. The side dishes were excellent too; sauteed spinach, mushroom assortment, and ground grits with bacon. I paired my main course with a nice Willamette Pinot Noir.  All in all, it was a great steak. I wasn't sure it was the best steak I've ever had, but with the amount of steak houses I've been to I'm not sure I can really tell anymore. The service definitely puts on par if not apart with the big boys like Morton's and Capital Grille. I throughly pleased and unlike the Big 4, it's not everywhere!  It was a great dining experience, if you're in Vegas definitely check it out.",

My boyfriend was dying to try wagyu beef.  We started out with some oysters. They were heavenly. Fresh and full of deliciousness. We had three different kinds from NY.  The table next to us received one too many desserts, so they passed theirs off to us at this point. Not a traditional order for courses, but it was delicious. We had the flourless chocolate cake with the blood orange sorbet.The sorbet was out of control. It went perfectly with the cake.  For our main course, I had lobster. It was delicious! Perhaps a little too much spice (I prefer butter and lemon on my lobster to let the lobster flavor come out), but it was still great and I ate the whole thing. My boyfriend got the wagyu skirt steak. I have literally never seen him so happy in my life. I tasted it and it was INCREDIBLE. I've never tasted anything like that before! We ate the whole thing.  We also got the brussel sprouts with bacon. Although we didn't have much room let for them, they were still wonderful.   We had a delicious Malbec with our food. The wine list here is extensive and great.  The service was good. A little formal and stiff, but they took really good care of us.  I'd be back in a heartbeat! This place is amazing.",

After all the partying up to that point and with a full night ahead, I didn't want to pass out late night so only ate a lil bit of food.   Ordered a Cesar salad---just ok & Sea Diver Scallops---very tasty! I opted for wine this evening (again trying to pace myself) Riesling was delicious.   Couple guys had steaks and sides. Some ordered Lobster bisque and shrimp cocktail another guy followed my lead and ordered a salad...  With tip the bill was just over $300 so very reasonable for a high end steakhouse.  Service was good but you know it wasn't special... (reminds me of a frat boy saying \"yeah I $#%^@* her\".   I feel the same way about Craftsteak it's just a restaurant, what you see is what you get.

Everything but the steak, though, was great. The decor was hip and elegant and comfortable. The service was impeccable.  The corn was the best we've ever had--it was an actual revelation. Ditto the fruit and monkeybread.  But you don't got to Craftsteak for corn or fruit or monkeybread. You go for steak, and our steaks (domestic Wagyu) were overcooked, and not particularly flavorful.  I've had better, several times, and for far less money.   So, if I had to do it again, here's what I would do differently:  No Wagyu.  No tasting menu. Two tasting menus for two people = an obscene amount of food. One appetizer or salad, one or two sides, and two entrees would be a much better proposition.",

I'm staying across the street at the Hooters Hotel and I know this place is in the MGM. Great!   After meeting my buddy in Vegas and pretty much drinking all day, there is only one thing I want to do, eat a great steak dinner. Yeah!   We have 6:00 reservations and so I stop drinking at 2:30. I jump in the shower and put on nice clothes. My buddy? He keeps drinking until 5:00, runs upstairs and is ready at 5:40. We walk over to the restaurant.   I was looking forward to this place for dinner. We start talking about Iraq (Herbert Walkers Iraqi war) and how we knew all the blood that was spilled in the mud, etc.. He starts getting loud and is WOLFING down bread that was out of this world. It was baked in a small tray with Kosher salt on top.   We ordered two lobster bisque's that were OK. I'm from Long Island, I want more lobster in my soup, thank you very much Tom.   I quickly order a steak for two, Asparagus and spinach sides and the waiter who was great throws us a free potato dish. We ordered a medium rare steak. The steak was ok, a little too rare in the middle, I give those pieces to old drunky.   I'm coming back to Vegas in a few months with my family, If I would have ordered this meal and was served meat not cooked perfectly at these prices? I'd be calling Tom at the TV studio and have him cook the friggin steak himself.   I still give 4 stars because the bread was really, really good",

Imagine your table covered with 6 big kobe steaks, each of which was a different kind of kobe steak. I can't remember all the types but the flank steak was excellent and our unanimous fave,  ribeye was very good, sirloin was decent. Overall all the steaks were very good - perhaps I'm not a steak expert but I honestly could not tell the difference kobe beef and regular steak. Not sure if it's just my unsophisticated steak palate or whether the kobe steak here was not that great.   Everything (including the steaks) came family steak so we eat could try everything:   Appetizers: - Steak tartar - Huge scallops - Caesar salad - Ahi tuna  Sides: - Asparagus - Whipped mash potatoes - Vegetables - Mushrooms   Dessert assortment - one of the best parts of the meal! - banana cheesecake - bread pudding - various ice creams (pineapple, coconut, etc)  Wine menu - extensive and the red wine recommended to us was smooth and delicious  Service was very professional, courteous, and helpful as it should at such a fancy place.   Bottom line: This steak place doesn't mess around. All the steaks tasted great but I'm not giving a 5 since I have had better (e.g. Smith and Wollensky's). If you can, the chef's tasting menu is the way to go!",

I had the Oysters to start, Angus Beef Filet with Scallops, Asparagus, Potato Puree, and sampled some of my friends' dessert. The fact that I can remember nearly everything I had speaks volumes. Service was outstanding.   BTW, What happens in Vegas doesn't stay in Vegas when you're so dehydrated that you fall backwards with your chair. This happened at a large top table directly next to our booth. While we can only assume that the diner (obviously in Vegas with a group of friends) was probably dehydrated from, well, drinking like he was in Vegas, it was interesting to see how management handled such an event (leaving the diner on the floor next to us until he recovered from passing out.) No paramedics were needed and the table left shortly, but certainly an odd experience to accompany our dinner.",

    "text": "Ya, not so much.   I visited Craftsteak for a birthday dinner. There were three of us at the table on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was busy but by no means \"Vegas busy\". We were seated promptly for our 7:30 reservation and greeted by one waiter and then another telling us that they would both be assisting us that evening. I was impressed!.....but then that was it. Our waiters went totally AWOL after taking our drink orders. After checking back with us 10 minutes later we were finally able to order. I waited 25 minutes for my (cold) salad to arrive to the table. Making the total time we waited for our food about 40 minutes (3 med rare steaks, 2 sides). The timing was obscene! AND when our food came the waiter(s) still never checked back with us. The most attentive person in the entire place was the bus boy (I wish I could have tipped him and left our waiters a goose egg).   As for the food, it left much to be desired. I had the filet ($58) and it tasted like a $20 steak you'd get at any restaurant, anywhere, ever. The other steaks were just as disappointing. The BEST menu item is the free bread.  We did tell the manager how disappointed we were in the service. Whether she did anything or not, I'm not sure but I'd like to hope she did and that the service will improv.  SKIP CRAFTSTEAK (Unless the food and service dramatically improve.)",

Loved that he offered to split two glasses of wine so I could try the white and red that he had since I am limited to one glass on special occasions due to pregnancy. Easy to get reservations here too, we had them at 8:30 to make Ka on a Friday night. The seasonal menu was lovely and for us, the best part wasn't even the steak! We loved the first part with the veggies and appetizers. The quail was excellent!  Dessert was great, although I have to be honest, what is with this maple bacon ice cream craze going right now? I found it more novel than tasty. Wrote Congratulations on our dessert plate too! (we were on our \"babymoon\") Will DEFINITELY return. Thanks chef!",

    "text": "The food was amazing! The mashed potatoes were perfectly creamy and the steaks were nicely seasoned. We came with a group of 6 adults and 3 kids, and ended up paying about $1400 total. We got a wide range of steaks including their wagyu, bone in ribeyes, and braised short rib was super tender. The hostess was soo amazing. I wish I remembered her name, but my dress strap snapped and she helped me staple it to fix it in the bathroom. She was a sweet girl, and she was very professional about it even though I was embarrassed.  The only reason that I am giving four stars instead of five is because if service from the rest of the staff: servers and bussers. They seem to have lost some filter and sensitivity when delivering messages or providing good service. It feels almost like a sense of entitlement on their side. The server was irritated at simple questions like \"do the sides come with the steak?\", I understand this might be annoying and irritating but that is your job to properly inform the guest, gain their trust to be able to upsell, and maximize your tip. One of the steaks was too rare for my friend so we asked if he could get it cooked a little more. It's not like it was overdone and couldn't be fixed. He rolled his eyes and took the steak. We had two birthdays and asked him to bring dessert for it. He came by at the end and said we have two birthdays don't we? Whose birthday is it? Isn't there seat numbers? It's awkward to raise your hand claim your \"surprise\" birthday dessert. I wouldn't care if this was Applebee's, but I do expect much more higher standards from a restaurant of this caliber. The bussers refilled waters recklessly without watching out for accidentally bumping patrons at the table. I asked the lady Busser in the end if there is a plastic cup to be able to take my drink. She said no and snatched my plates away abruptly. The service left a salty taste in my mouth. Good food, but I probably won't be coming back or recommending this restaurant in the future.",

Wagyu tartare. topped with a quail egg and chives. This is one of the best beef tartare I have ever eaten. It's so good, you will want to have this all to yourself. No sharing!  Dry aged Prime bone-in New York strip 16oz. Roasted. Med rare. This was the only steak that was dry aged for 42 days. The others were only 21 days or 28 days. I think it was the T-bone that was 28 days. I like my dry aged steaks a minimum of 28 days so this left me with the NY. (The t-bone would have been too big of a steak for me to finish). The steaks are in two categories, grilled or roasted. Roasted is the way to go. It is seared first then finished off in the oven to perfection. The temp came out perfect. The distinct flavor of the dry age really shows.  Great selection of whiskey and scotch. FYI they charge $4 for a rock.",

    "text": "To me, the prices on a menu amount to a promise: if your steak is 10x the price of another place's same cut of steak, you're saying to me, \"the experience of eating this steak is 10x better than that other guy's steak.\" Better can comprise more than just the steak,itself, it includes the overall dining experience. Colicchio's fails to meet that promise.  Don't get me wrong, they've got an attentive, solicitous staff. Absent that staff, this would have been a one-star rating (lower if the option were available). I ordered a shrimp cocktail and split the beef tartare with my wife as starters. I ordered the surf & turf as my main.  Didn't order wine because this week is likely to be heavy in exertion and alcohol and wanted to save the livery pummeling for later in the week. That said, the wine menu seemed fairly complete. When your wine menu has a ToC and the red burgundies start at page 32 (and that page is maybe the halfway point of the booklet), you can assume the place has a fairly deep wine menu. So, points for that. The wine my wife ordered was fairly decent, so points there.  Where it all fell apart was the food.  The shrimp cocktail was fairly basic ...so didn't really warrant the premium price vice what I'm used to back in the DC area (an area not exactly known for low-priced dining options).  The steak tartare was very bland. Really wanted kicking up with capers and/or horseradish ...or even a peppery type of leafy green accent. To be honest, my wife makes far better tartare at home.  My turf-half of my main was competent if not especially worthy of the price premium. The surf-half, on the other hand, was godawful. Yeah, I should cut them some slack for being 2000+ miles from Maine. That said, if you're going to put something on the menu, you should be confident that your efforts will be well received. The lobster meat was overcooked and dry ...and pretty much tasteless but for the concentrating-effect that the preparation-method had on the iffier elements of distance-shipped lobster. The clarified butter it was served with actually made the experience worse. The only thing that made it somewhat tolerable was lemon juice ...which I had to ask for (it wasn't just served with a lemon).  Oh well: at least the meal got me a decent amount of hotel points. I probably should have considered the fact that \"this is a hotel restaurant\" before plunking down for $300+ for a meal for two (though, restaurants in hotels like the Four Seasons are reliably better than this place was).",

    "text": "Craftsteak was our choice for a big family dinner on the most recent visit to Sin City. I admit that there were some pretty large expectations to live up to considering the location, price and name on the sign outside. Everyone had some mixed reviews of their meals.  Starters consisted of three different salads and a charcuterie board.   The Caesar salad ended up being a bit of a let down. Dressing was a bit too thin, not much flavor of garlic, and the pickled anchovy didn't really add much to the dish. Definitely not enough seasoning. The croutons were excellent.  Cucumber salad was light and tasty. Just complex enough to be a fun start to a meal without blowing up the palate. Crisp and refreshing.  Avocado salad came in a generous serving. Certainly the rich cousin of that light cucumber concoction, it was beautifully presented and worth the order.  Charcuterie board consisted of five or six contrasting meats with a sampling of a handful of unusual yet wonderful mustards. I spent my time trying to determine exactly what each mustard was but to me honest, they were eclectic and delicious. I couldn't do it!  Our steaks were a bit hit and miss. Everyone wanted a different cook and we each chose a different cut. I understand that high end meat deserves high end treatment BUT everyone likes their cook on a steak their way. We made sure to not just order by rare, mid-rare... etc, but by color and temperature.  The filets were underdone. By that I mean the were a perfect mid-rare (purple) but that was not the order of my dining companions. Our wonderful server would have likely delivered the proper info to the kitchen but personal knowledge took the wheel on those two dishes. One was sent back for some more heat and came out medium well to the delight of the customer. I thought it was SLAMMED but again, not my order and everyone is different!  The T-Bone was a shade under but still great.   The ribeye I ordered was the most well done piece of meat on the table. Was looking for a rare +, got a slightly more than mid-rare cook. Honestly I was maybe glad for it as the fat had rendered nicely and it was full of flavor. I will defer that result to the expertise of the kitchen. That was a good piece of meat.  Cauliflower side, amazing.  Asparagus, simple yet nice.  Fingerling potatoes, over seasoned but cooked beautifully.  Dessert was a non cloying, light and fluffy chocolate cake with an absolutely perfect chocolate malt ice cream. It was simple and brilliant.  The service at this restaurant was excellent from beginning to end. The only criticism would be the annoying photographer. We weren't really asked whether we wanted be interrupted for photos, we just were. We then pose in silly ways. Later on she comes back with folios for sale at some exorbitant price. The photos weren't great to begin with and they the photographer seemed put out when we wouldn't throw down $100. Could have done without that.  Again, service was great. Attentive, unobtrusive, friendly and non-snobby.  Decor was hip, music was classic rock. Cool.  All in all a meal with bright moments and small let downs. Maybe I have high expectations but a fancy restaurant should be able to meet those. I enjoyed my meal but the value for money wasn't quite there.",

    "text": "From the second you are greated by the hostess, then your server and everyone the service is impeccable!   Ordered the tequila drink specialy only to find they were out of pasion fruit. Since my server suggested the drink I gather they might not have had a pre-service meeting to advise what was sold out. They substituted with cherry juice - well it for sure ruined the taste of the tequila. So, that was a little disappointed and that's were the disappointments stop.... because everything else was outstanding.  Now I will cut them some slack because they've been closed for 10 days and let's face it - things happen.   I ordered a hanger steak mostly due to the fact that all the others were 10oz and larger. They should have some small filets possibly. Anyhow, ordered wood mushrooms and onions and the server was kind enough to make them half orders and ordered the potato puree.  Within minutes of ordering they served the most delish warm little rolls with perfect temperature butter - almost like Hawaiian rolls....yummy and I can assume made in-house   Wow were do I start with the fabulous meal...... The steak was mouth watering tender and just delish ! The potato puree was sooooo velvety smooth and not a lump or bump in site and the smell of chive in it was very nice. The onions were caramelized and cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were very nice - cooked perfectly.   With all that said,  left over was a whole other meal which was such a shame. Couldn't  take a \"doggy bag\" because going to a show then gambling and stray dogs might start to follow me if I carried it around .   The meal was expensive, however the experience and quality of everything was outstanding.   The General Manager Chris (very attractive young man) popped in to the table to say hi which is always a nice personal touch for a restaurant.   As my server brought the bill and also brought two cookies which I had him take back as i really could not have eaten another morsel (VERY large portions!)  I'm so glad I made the effort to come to the MGM to experience this restaurant which I was really looking forward to.",

Beautiful decor with a modern twist on a steakhouse with a variety of music playing in the background (rock to Beatles to Michael Jackson).  Onto the menu, everything sounded amazing. It's hard to choose but my top picks include the Ny strip with potato puree, arugula salad with pine nuts (citrus dressing made it worth it!), and mushroom medley.  Be forewarned - the sharing menu is A LOT of food. Great deal if you can handle that food! We did the double R steak meal - came with two steaks, 2 salads, 2 chef appetizers, 3 sides and 2 desserts.

    "text": "I saved all my pennies for a fancy, reputable dinner and what I got was a meal of disappointment and regret. We made a reservation and were able to get a table at our requested time without difficulty. This was nice. This place was a little bit hard to find. It's located in MGM and there aren't really great signs directing you. We ended up using google maps and walking the route that came up. It was a good walk from the main entrance.   The servers were nice. We had like 4. The server who passed out the menu informed us that Tom Colichio was in town. \"What here? Tonight? To cook for us?\" I asked eagerly. \"Oh. No,\" replied the server, \"he's just in town.\" Ok. Thats nice. Don't care.   The prices ranged from normal expensive steak prices to really expensive steak prices ($50- and up to 275 for wagyu). We decided to try a sampler, the wagyu steak which was about $160 per person. Service was soooo slow. So slow. All that anticipation and for naught.  First course: 1. Rolls- nice and buttery 2. Caeser salad- nothing unique. Huge cuts or romaine lettuce lightly dressed with croutons. I would say there were too many croutons. 16$ regularly priced is not worth it. You might as well get a better caeser at red lobster- True story 3. Market spinach- this was weird. It's a salad tossed with peaches. It was not a cohesive dish. The peaches were no particularly pretty to look at and my friend thought they were beats. It did not enhance the salad or make it better. Not worth it at all. 4. Wild arugula- way over seasoned. Mouth full of dressing. Also not impressed. 5. charcuterie- meh 6. Shrimp cocktail- pretty good. Plump shrimp. Large size.   Second course 5. Wagyu New York strip- what a shame. This beautiful slab of meat was totally over cooked. It was like chomping on beef jerky. This was the least enjoyable and most disappointing 6. Ribeye- this was good but not particularly unique 7. Skirt steak- better. Juicy and flavorful 8. Filet mignon- this is what wagyu need should be like. Melt in your mouth delicious.  9. Scallops- these were good. Plump and juicy.   Sides 1. Mashed potatoes super silky and creamy. This was good 2. Risotto- this was well cooked, slightly al dente very creamy 3. Cauliflower medley- too salty, not good 4. Mushroom assortment- total disappointment and a shame since the mushrooms were varied and some exotic. So so disappointing  Third course dessert 1. Sorbet- this came with like 6 different flavors. It was fresh and the fruit ones you could tell were made with real fruit. This was the best 2. Monkey bread- also very good. Has this caramel toffee flavor 3. Chocolate cake- not impressed. Cloying sweet 4. Strawberry shortcake- also not impressed. It's shortcake so it's dry but no unique spin nothing.  I rarely give upper level restaurants two stars but the disappointment was too much. If this reputable establishment is going to charge so much money, everything better be perfect. I should've saved my money for Gordon Ramsey. Tom colichio will continue to live in obscurity in my book. Sigh. So disappointing.",

First of all the level of service here is top notch and The ambiance gave an intimate vibe.   Now the food.. porterhouse for 2 comes with a bone marrow.. man I'm drooling just thinking about that porterhouse.. it was seasoned to perfection and cooked to the perfect temperature. Good sides to go with the delicious steak? That potato puree and an order of asparagus. If it's just two people this is more enough food.. my friend and i also ordered the prosciutto appetizer and it was a generous portion but perfect to share and leave room to enjoy the steak. The bread they give is pretty delicious too.   When I'm back in Vegas I'm making sure I snag another reservation here, perhaps to try the wagyu.",

No doubt in my mind. The wife has the skirt steak. Great. The sweet potato mash was perfect.   The butternut squash was tough. Even the server admitted it after the meal - it was often too al dente for most customers. We are a single bite of it- no removing it. It's not expected but if it's continually a complaint- someone should adjust.",

    "text": "I swear I gained a good 5-10lbs after my dinner, but it was SO WORTH IT!  My bf made reservations for us to dine here and first things first, when you have 10 different steaks for you to choose form on the menu, you have absolutely no idea where to start. Even for salads they had 10 different kinds I believe and don't get me started on their sides. I'm pretty sure our servers knew I was pretty indecisive on EVERYTHING on the menu so they suggested that we order from the right side of the menu, called \"Chef's Beef Selection\". Basically there is this small box on the right side that lists i think 5 different choices and you can choose one of those steak/seafood choices and by choosing that, it also comes with the following (see below for reference)  Instead of \"what I ordered\", it's \"what was included\": - we each got a bowl of lobster bisque - we had 3 different salads to share (we asked the chef for his recommendation on the top 3 most popular salads and we got the: warm frisee, market spinach, and one with all tomatoes. apparently tomatoes were in season when we went, so I assume that's why it was super popular.) - I got the 24 hour beef short ribs (it was so tender and juicy) - the BF got the Japanese A5 Wagyu (and it was cut into multiple slices, yum) - we had 3 different sides to share, which were: mushroom medley, corn, and a potato side the BF wanted, you can see the pics for reference) - last but not least, DESSERT, came with 4 different choices as well: monkey break, fresh fruit, 2 scoops of ice cream/sorbet, and pudding.  This was definitely a lot of food to inhale for the night but for that price we paid, all this food was definitely worth it as oppose to just ordering one entree per person, when the Chef's Selection came with so many choices. I would definitely recommend the Chef's Selection to those who are just as indecisive as I am because you can never have too many FOOD choices for one meal.",

Well to my amazement dinner was by all means not great, I ordered the rib eye steak medium it came bloody as hell also how can you forget the salt Really not great. but the mashed potato puree was indeed great, so I swallowed those bread warm n good. the wife ordered the filet and bloody as hell again, she had to return it finally when it came back it tasted like a dirty wet rag, her spinach salad was good. Finally she return the filet and told them it tasted horrible. they took it of the bill which that's at least what they could've done. 2 stars 1 for the bread and 1 for the salad. That's it.....",

It's on the pricey side of things, but worth it.  The staff is attentive, but not intrusive, the food is always perfectly prepared. Share the sides, they are big.

    "text": "I was very excited to visit Craftsteak because I am a big fan of Tom's, but I left feeling disappointed.  First, the bread that we got was cold and reminded us of King's Hawaiian Rolls.  They were nothing special, which we expected from a place of this caliber.  My husband ordered a strip steak and it was awesome!  The disappointment came with my steak - the t-bone.  It lacked any real flavor.  It was almost as if they forgot to salt and pepper it.  Hence the disappointment.  The side dishes were great, as well as the service.  The manager was also very nice in taking the steak off of the bill.  I would definitely recommend Craftsteak to give it a try, but I know we won't be back.",

For the 3 of us, they gave us a filet, rib eye and ny.  Ordered it rare and it was all very very nice.  Especially the filet, it truly melted in my mouth.  Very well seasoned.  Family style included their choice of sides.  Which I liked the surprise of having chef's choice.  These sides were again all flavorful and delicious especially the potato puree, OMG.  I haven't had Robuchon's but I don't know if any can be better for now.  Prosciutto & figs, brussel sprouts, mozzerella tomato, assortment of sauteed mushrooms, potato puree.  All fantastic.  They gave us 5 plated desserts for the 3 of us.  WTF?    Wine pairing was on point.    I will be back to splurge on the Japanese Wagyu tasting menu/wine pairing...I can only imagine how crazy that would be.  The only complaint I have was too much good food.  A lot of leftovers back to hotel room.  Super happy.",

    "text": "I JUST HAD THE BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE. asdfklj;asdfjklasjdfkl;aksfjkl;asdfkjl;k;j okay my word vomit begins now:  Ate here for my 21st bday dinner... I have to admit I'm a HUGE Tom Colicchio fan so that was what brought me here... AFTER EATING HERE, I LOVE TOM COLICCHIO THAT MUCH MORE.  For starters, I had the MOZZARELLA with roma tomatoes and hazelnuts. SO DELICIOUS. My mom got this FRIED GOAT CHEESE WITH BEETS salad and IT WAS SOOOOO NOM. The cheese was just OOZING and complimented the beets perfectly. I'm normally not a beets person but I LOVED THIS!!!   ENTREE: My mom and I got the 24-HOUR BRAISED SHORT RIBS. OHHHH MYYYY GODDDD. These babies melted in my mouth. Literally. SOOOOO TENDER. And they give you a HUGE slab. HUGE!!!!! Yes, Craftsteak is pricey, but unlike other \"fine dining\" eateries I've been to, their portions actually made me FULL and this was worth EVERY PENNY. My sister got the kurobota porkchop, which was quite delicious too, but I suggest sticking to their forte- their beef entrees. My dad got the filet mignon which, I quote unquote, was \"the best filet I've ever had.\" Wow and my dad has had a lot of filets in his lifetime. THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.   SIDES: Yukon Gold Potato Puree with Chives- IDK how much butter they use in this thing, maybe I don't wanna know but it was incredibly NOM. It's puree, so it's not chunky like mashed potatoes. It's smooth and buttery and just compliments the meat!!!  Spinach- super fresh spinach roasted with olive oil... pretty simple but I love spinach and this was DELICIOUS.  DESSERT: I was wayyyyyy too stuffed to order my own dessert but my sister got a combo of SPICED APPLE CIDER SORBET + CHAI CHOCOLATE CHIP GELATO. Yes, the gelato/sorbets are $6 for 2 scoops which is pretty good considering most places only give you one scoop for the same price. We were having a hard time deciding which one to get so our waiter said we could have one scoop of each!! how nice. These flavors were unique and quite delicious! The apple cider sorbet was so refreshing and got me feeling quite the holiday spirit.   The service was fast, our waiter was friendly and our water was always refilled. The next dish always came out at the perfect moment- not too soon after the previous, but not too long where you get angry.   Bottom line: I LOVE YOU CRAFTSTEAKHOUSE.",

We had a group of 5 guys and were seated in one of the booths which have a private feel as they have curtains separating them.  At each of the tables they have the drink menu on IPad's which was pretty cool. Our waiter mentioned that we would have 4 servers covering our table which was good but confusing. The only downside of our meal is that it did take some time to order more drinks.  All 5 of us ordered the 3 course chef's tasting menu and it was enough food for 10 people! The waiter mentioned that they would choose for us and they did a great job. For the first course we had caeser salad, frisee salad, several orders of shrimp cocktail, and charcuterie.  They then brought out 5 different cuts of steak with multiple sides. It was interesting to try some from the Strip, Filet, T-Bone and Ribeye in the same meal.     Then they brought out the cheesecake, carrot cake, monkey bread, cheese plate and sorbet/ice cream tastings. We were already full before dessert but had to try them and they were all tasty!  We had a great selection of different starters, steaks, sides and desserts and the chef's tasting menu is a great way to go at Craft Steak!",

We've gone through the whole list - including the overpriced Japanese Wagyu - and they are all delicious and cooked to perfection.    The sides are awesome. It may sound stupid, but this place has some of the best vegetables I have ever had. I am not a big fan of vegetables, but I will eat anything this place cooks - carrots, spinach, brussels sprouts - you name it.  Desert? Yes, please. Monkeybread. Everytime. Essentially it is just like the caramel rolls my grandma used to make. It is unbelievable.  If you can stomach the cost, this place comes with my highest possible recommendation.",

We asked for a medium rare ribeye and got medium. We asked the waiter for his opinion even though the entire 12 person table agreed. To his credit the waiter agreed and we got a replacement that was accurately medium rare.   Then we noticed everyone struggling to cut their steaks and realized unfortunately the knives weren't very sharp. Again, even the waiter agreed they should sharpen their knives more.  Well what else can I say, he agreed with both concerns.   My take is good but not great. With so much competition I'm looking at the VALUE factor and this place didn't measure on this particular night.  Is it a good steak, sure. Is it a memorable great steak, not for me.  3 stars for food, 4 stars for service. 2 stars for experience.",

He knows food well and he also works in the food industry so his taste and palette is really top notch in my book. So when we went to Vegas for a work conference a few weeks before out 3 year anniversary, I decided it was time for me to take him out to a nice restaurant and hopefully \"WOW\" him with my choice of restaurant. We watch a lot of Top Chef and other food shows and I, myself, was also on the Food Network but it was for \"Worst Cooks in America\" so let's just say I don't know food well. But my fiance has trained me well and my palette has improved immensely. So I remember him saying he always wanted to try Tom Colichhio's restaurant but that when he tried to book a reservation for my birthday, it was always full. So I quickly made reservations and made it happen!  It was such a perfect night and perfect experience from beginning to end. Service was top notch of course. So friendly and so helpful. They gave us a nice semi-private booth and it was so nice. We got cocktails which were delicious and strong. I guess we both aren't heavy drinkers so 1 drink was enough to get us a little light-headed. haha  My fiance ordered the ribeye steak that was cooked to perfection with such amazing flavors! I ordered short rib and yet again it was so juicy and flavorful.  Both piece of meets was just divine and mouth watering. I'm drooling just thinking about it and I totally want to come back here again. It was the best steak and short rib I've ever had! As for sides, we ordered the potato gratin and brussel sprouts with delicious cured bacon sprinkled about. I personally felt the brussel sprouts were a tad too salty but my fiance loved them and didn't feel it was too salty. I loved the potato gratin thought!  We couldn't finish all our food and ate it the next day for another meal and it was still as good as we remembered it. We didn't order any dessert but the chef gave us a tiny piece of dessert on a platter that says \"congratulations\" to celebrate our engagement and anniversary. Aww than you chef!  Overall, it was an amazing and wonderful experience. Very romantic and great service and superb quality food. I want to come back here!! It was that good!",

The Waiter was very arrogant and condescending when we asked questions about how the steaks and potatoes were prepared. Ordered a T-bone and it was fatty and absolutely tasteless. So disappointed in the quality of the food for the price. The potatoes looked like soup and came out cold. We sent the potatoes back and barely ate the steak. We have been to quite a few steak houses in the casino's and this was by far our worst experience. The management did comp our bottle of wine so they did address our concerns. However If you are staying at the MGM I would skip this restaurant.",

After all, we were feeding 3. ;-)  They were right. And it was divine.   While nothing that we ordered was very unique or innovative, I appreciated how every.single.thing. we ordered was spot on. (See pictures for the complete spread.) Everything was well cooked, deliciously seasoned, and just left me wishing I had enough space for more of, well.. everything.  I tried numerous cuts of steak that were out of my realm since I've always traditionally gone for the filet mignon at steakhouses and everything was just tender and juicy.  And yes, the Cinnamon Monkey Bread is 100% worth every sinful calorie.   Between the food, cozy booths, and the intimate ambiance, if Craftsteak were any closer, it would be my regular haunt when craving steak. Like tonight.",

    "text": "The steak was sumptuous in proportion. I ordered skirt steak Wagyu and it was way too big for one person (I would encourage sharing) and quite buttery in taste.  The hens of the wood side was the best and lobster bisque didn't disappoint.  The bourbon and maple ice cream at the end was a good way of rounding up a meal that required too much stretching of one's stomach.  If you want a great glass of red, order Flowers Pinot noir from Sonoma coast. Very balanced and can stand up to the Wagyu served here.  I also had the pear  Martini and thought that it was mediocre.",

I wasn't that turned off by the prices as I'll pay good money for a good steak.  First off the service was very good. Waiters were attentive and friendly, hence the second star.  However, the food was not good at all. I have to say the only thing that was tasty were the buns they brought to the table. The steaks were flavorless and all 4 of us at the table agreed that the meal was sub par. Those steaks might be worth 1/3 of the price they were charging.   I know it's Vegas and you pay a premium but I can guarantee you a better meal at another restaurant for a fraction of the price. We paid $225 per couple for 3 drinks, 3 sides, and 4 entrees. Pretty dissatisfied.",

    "text": "There comes a time when you just go all out.  Whether you are in the right mindset or not, you just go for it.  You don't think about cost or consequences thereafter.  You just close your eyes and hope for the best.  With Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at the MGM, I did just that. I knew it was way over my budget, but I just went with it. Maybe it was the Vegas air and wanted to live the Vegas dream of fine dining. It's not like I won big at the craps tables. I just wanted to \"do Vegas right\" and dine like I never do.  It's not everyday you get a meal with all of the fixings and trimmings -- maybe when Christmas or Thanksgiving rolls around, but even then, nothing like this -- nothing like having dish after dish after dish, all laid out in front of you. This indeed was something special. Expensive, but special.  Las Vegas is all about grandeur.  Excess of everything with a splash of flashiness is what everyone expects in Vegas.  Craftsteak, with the interior design and cuisine is a bit dialed down.  Some may see that as something negative, but this was executed with excellence.  The food and the design exuded a sense of humble refinement.  A kind of \"my food doesn't have to be extravagant\" to be Las Vegas enough, kind of attitude.  Tom Colicchio's menu is simple, and does it elegantly.  The bread and butter was served in a not so normal cast iron pan. The bread was soft and warm -- the butter was delicious as it should.  Appetizer: The Lobster Bisque was near perfection. The way they did it was unique and interesting. The soup bowl had nothing inside expect spices and chunks of lobster. The waiter then poured in the hot bisque inside the bowl. The taste was amazingly delicious. Lobster chucks filled every spoonful. The bisque was rich and creamy and full of seafood flavor. The Lobster Bisque itself was well worth the experience.  Appetizer: The Itallian buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts was mellow. Not robust in flavors, the taste was a bit subtle. The tomatoes and balsamic helped round out the flavors. The mozzarella was fresh as can be.  Appetizer: The Warm Frisee salad had some intense flavors going on -- a great thing. It had a farm egg, smoked bacon, mustard seed, and blue cheese. The bacon and blue cheese were rich and fatty, and the mustard seed helped cleanse the palate. Intense tastes and bitter greens made this dish amazing.  Appetizer: Their Caesar salad was a bit bland. I dug the pickled anchovy though.  The Ribeye is one of my favorite cuts of steak. Mine was 16 oz, bone in, cooked to a medium rare. Perfectly cooked, I couldn't ask for a better piece of meat. Each bite was perfect texturally, but I felt it lacked seasoning. Maybe the rich flavors of the appetizers killed my taste buds, but the Ribeye could have used some salt. Heck, this might be cheating, but I would have loved some blue cheese on the side. Translation: I love blue cheese.  Interestingly, the 22 oz T Bone had a better flavor for me -- it must be the dry aging process. It had a rich beef flavor that was missing from the Ribeye. Still cooked perfectly, the meat was succulent and tender.  Side: The yukon potato puree was amazing. It was such a simple dish. It was rich with a lot of butter and cream. The taste was like no other. It was smooth and delicious and the chives on top gave it enough zest to keep me coming back for more.  Side: The assorted mushrooms were a perfect accompaniment to the meat. What's better that meat and potatoes than adding mushrooms in the mix? They each had a different bite to it.  Side: Another potato other than the puree was the potatoes gratin. The potato slices were mixed in with a roasted garlic cream. The taste was perfect with the meat.  Dessert: I thought monkey bread pudding was a funny name for a dessert, but the taste was addicting. The bread was sweet and dense, kind of like a cinnamon bun. The rich caramel sauce with the bread pudding and ice cream all mixed well perfectly.  Dessert: I always see cactus pear sorbet on TV, and always wanted to try it. I was pleasantly surprised, and I fell in love with it. The taste was very mellow and not too sweet. The color of the sorbet was vibrant as was the flavors. The fruit slices, candied dates and dragon fruit were mediocre. My favorite fruit is the Asian pear -- I like it because it has a nice bite to it with a lot of juice. The pear sliced wafer thin gave it no bite and not a lot a moisture. The dragon fruit was exotic, and taste was mild. None of this fruit mess. I am in Vegas -- more Monkey Bread Pudding Please!  Dessert: The most decadent dessert was the chocolate moose. The chocolate in this was super chocolatey and dense. The vanilla ice cream was as pure as can be, but the peaches on the side didn't excite me.  Tom Colicchio's steakhouse was in the end, worth it.  Plate after plate, dish after dish, the food seamed endless.  The impeccable service and comfortable seating arrangements made this long endeavor a treat I will never forget.",

    "text": "It's a tradition that for my birthday, my husband takes me to a restaurant that's a surprise, and somewhere we've never been before. When he revealed that was taking me to Craftsteak, he prefaced it with a lengthy justification, mainly centered on the fact that, yes, Craftsteak is a steakhouse, but they have an impressive assortment of vegetable options. I was not disappointed.  The menu changes daily, apparently, and does have lots of veggie options (though most of them are garnished with some manner of pork products, so if you're strictly vegetarian, this is not your place).   When we sat down, we were brought a cast-iron pan of the most delicious dinner rolls--fluffy, light, and yeasty, but impossibly buttery, with a sprinkle of salt on top. I felt a little ridiculous putting butter on mine, but I did it anyway. yeasty, buttery rolls with a sprinkle of salt on top  We ordered the Billionaire Cocktail (Booker's Bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, dash of grenadine, star anise) and the Cucumber Gin Martini (Hendricks Gin, cucumber, fresh lime sour). Both were delicious...sweeter than I normally go for, but not unbalanced. They bring the martini glass with the garnish to the table, and then an individual shaker with the cocktail separately. The shakers has roughly 1.3 martinis.  The Bibb salad was a generous portion, beautiful, smoky, crisp, with pickled onion, chives, blue cheese, and lardons. It was perfet to share.  We were thiknking of skipping entrees altogether and just loading up on all the tempting sides, but my husband insisted it was too ridiculous, so we got the European Sea Bass (beurre blanc, chives, a pile of sauteed Napa cabbage, shiitake mushrooms, and a piece of crispy pancetta on top). The fish was well cooked and flaky, and the sauce complemented it without overpowering.  I was particularly excited about the mushrooms--you can order several different varieties, or get the Mushroom Assortment. We were planning to get the assortment, but there were too many other things we wanted to try. I'm glad we didn't...the Hen of the Woods was tasy, but not impressive. (NB, If you want amazing mushrooms, go to a Thomas Keller restaurant.)  Since it was my birthday, I ordered a few things that I normally would have compromised on, but it turned out that my husband enjoyed them--kale and Maui onions. The kale was cooked to the brink of death, and studded with cannelini beans and lardons. It was more of a Southern greens preparation, and it was delicious...smoky and bacon-y.   The Maui onions were cut in half and roasted, with Minus 8 Vinegar (made from ice wine). They were perfectly tender and sweet. Delicious  The butternut risotto was good but I expected it to be more flavorful, especially with the scallions and proscuitto.   The service was really good all night until the very end, when we had to wait a little while to get our bill.  Overall, it was a highly enjoyable meal, even sans steak.",

They checked in on us at just the right frequency, and when we ask for something, they execute it flawlessly with a great attitude.  Everyone in my party was impressed with their service.  As for the food, if you like steak, I don't think you can go wrong here.  Two in my party ordered the rib-eye and the other two ordered NY strips.  All steaks were cooked to the correct doneness and seasoned well.  The bordelaise sauce they served with our steaks paired very well with the meat.  We also shared a few side dishes, and the standouts in my mind were the risotto and brussel sprouts.  I've really enjoyed all of the meals I've had here and this is my go to restaurant for steak in Vegas.",

    "text": "Rained On My Parade  We were really looking forward to a delicious meal and a unique ambience at Craftsteak. But, alas, that unfortunately wasn't our experience.   Let's begin with the two highlights, first: Our busboy, George, and the Wagyu Skirt Steak. Both, incredible.   George was pleasant and lightning fast, and the Skirt Steak was seared and roasted beautifully. Moist, buttery and a full-bodied seasoning. I honestly had no idea that Skirt Steak could be transformed into something so spectacular.   We waited quite some time for our waiter...and rolls, which were mediocre, at best(this girl knows a fantastic yeasty roll when she sees and wraps her lips around one. Or 4).   Then, more time passed before our waiter eventually came back to take our order and answer some menu questions. When we were ultimately able to speak with him, it was really more akin to yelling. It's loud in this restaurant, to say the least.   Tip:  If loud and a fantastic steak are fantasies of yours, I'd skip Craftsteak and head over to STK.   For Sides:  We had the Mushroom Medley, which was beautiful to behold, but, lacking any type of enhancing flavor additions, such as garlic or butter or perhaps a bit of salt.  We also had the Yukon Potato Puree. They had a nice full-fat mouthfeel, but, tended toward the gummy side. The potatoes certainly didn't blow our minds, or float our parade, as hoped.   For now, \"Au Revoir, Craftsteak! Perhaps we will meat(pun intended) again!\"",

    "text": "Wow what an experience.... My love to me here for dinner and my mind was blown. Everything was beautiful: the decor, the ambiance and the food. He had made reservations and we were seated right on time, we were seated in this beautiful booth that felt very private.   Our server was charming and efficient. He made great suggestions. If you really want to get a little sampling of everything at the best value do the Chef's Beef Tasting Menu. It is the ultimate feast and very indulging.   We ordered the Wagyu Beef tasting menu. With this selection we got to pick 2 appetizers, 3 salads, 3 sides, 2 cuts of Wagyu and a dessert tasting sampler. It is quite an extravagant feast for 2 people but would be perfect for 4. It was a lot of food for 2 and could have easily fed 3 people.  Everything was delicious but the stand outs were: the fresh Burata, Caesar salad, Prosciutto, dessert tasting, and of course the steak.   The Burata was super fresh and so was the Caesar. Our steak was extremely tender and melted in your mouth. This is definitely the kind of steakhouse you go for if you like more soft, tender and lean steaks such as filet mignon or New York strip. I think I would have liked a ribeye or porterhouse more but it was delicious nonetheless. The dessert sampler was awesome. A myriad of sorbets, ice creams, fruits, and pastries. The monkey bread was to die for and so was the fluffy little Creme Brulee cake. I could eat 20 of those little cakes!  Basically it was the most indulgent little feast I've ever had. Food was excellent and so was service. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the little rolls they give you at the beginning are crack!!! I would definitely recommend Craftsteak for a special occasion of a fancy feast.",

    "text": "My first time to this place was back in January 2011 after it was recommended by a friend. This place is not cheap by any means between myself and two others, the bill came to about $400. But my issue isn't so much with the money as it is the quality and value I expected to get for that price.  I went on the cheaper side by getting a Surf and Turf for $65. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad either. I thought the lobster was actually better than the steak. My friend ordered the Surf and Turf as well and he shared the same opinion: it was just OK. The bottom line is: It wasn't worth $400.  Afterwards, I shared my disappointment with the friend who recommended this place to me. He said Surf and Turf wasn't the way to go and I should've ordered the Wagyu beef or filet. So a couple of days ago, I gave it another shot.  We went with a group of 12 people. The waiter highly recommended the chef special where you can get three courses but at least two people have to order it. I asked what the difference was between the beef in the Surf and Turf and the one in the special. He said the Surf and Turf was a grade 6 (it was 6 or 7) and the special was a grade 9. So I decided to join two others and placed the order.  We got three different cuts of Wagyu beef with this combo. There was filet mignon, new york, and ribeye. We asked for medium rare but all three cuts came out as medium. It was pink in the center but all three of us felt that it was overdone. When we compared all three with our friends who ordered just the standalone filet, theirs was actually done just right. Somehow, medium rare for the standalone was better and done correctly but the more expensive one was not. Go figure.  To say the least, the waiter was nice about it and gave good service throughout the entire time. He took back all three cuts and asked the kitchen to give us new ones. That took about 10 to 15 mins. Once the food came, it came out just the way we asked and expected...medium rare. It was tender and very pink for all three cuts.  None of us were able to finish all the beef. I think part of the reason was that it was too rich. The amount of oil from the serving dish was pretty thick. We had asparagus, mushroom risotto, and baby spinach as sides so they contributed to the feast.  Here's my bottom line. I gave this place second try and it didn't really make me feel any better. I spent quite a bit more this time...$175 for my meal and the overall experience was just barely OK. I'd never come back here again because I don't feel like it's worth my money. I can easily go to a different steakhouse for $100 in Vegas to get a better value.",

    "text": "Walked back dripping wet from the pool to try to score a last minute reservation. They suggested the lounge. Two hours later, walked downstairs with a party of five, and we got a table on a Friday night!  Our table was fairly large, oval, and in the back private dining room. It was kind of hard to speak/reach across the table. I didn't feel it, but my guests were shivering from the AC the entire time. The entire restaurant was fairly dark. A bachelor party was seated in our same room, and everything echoed. Whatever. Everyone's in Vegas to have a good time. There was a wedding party in the next room over. These private rooms also have a curtain.   Water was filled quickly. Menus, dessert menu, and check took a little longer. They gave us two pans of six rolls. So gooood! They're shaped like pan de leche, shiny with butter, flecked with sea salt, and comes with more triangles of butter. It almost looked like cheese. They were fresh, soft, and housemade.  I shared the filet mignon and prawn surf 'n turf skillet. The steak was petite to me. It was still delicious and tender. The prawns (five): MMMMM. My buddy doesn't eat the heads, so more for me. They were so sweet, perfectly textured, and perfectly charred on the shell. Being spoiled by Asian food, I'd have to say these were probably the best prawns I've EVER had. If only they'd start serving them salt and peppered. That night, the seafood definitely blew the meat out of the water.  My buddy's iced tea came with a mini jug of simple syrup and tons of lemon. His mozzarella \"salad\" was also so so. My girlfriend ordered a side (pot) of mashed potatoes with her never-ending skirt steak. They were certainly creamy - the watered consistency of grits. They tasted the way quality restaurant mashed potatoes should be, but it was strange scooping it off my plate with a fork. I should have asked for a straw.   The surf 'n turf was $62. I felt it was pricey for the size of my filet mignon. Dessert menu looked standard. The larger round lounge tables are amongst the open curtains/wall which is next to the bathrooms and walkway of MGM. Next time I'll get the rib eye and fries, which would probably be less expensive. Another table ordered the latter, and it was piled high in a bowl. Their tasting menu that week required at least two people to order since it came out family style. After our meal, the prix fixe seemed like a huge amount of food.",

    "text": "We had a family dinner with 5 people over the Thanksgiving holiday at Craftsteak.  We are fans of top chef.  Celebrity chef restaurants can be hit and miss, usually hit and always fun to try.    To really explore the menu, and have drinks or wine, and leave a tip you are going to spend $200.00 per person.  At some point you have say no meal is worth X dollars per person.   If because of your budget or sensibilities, X is less than $200.00, you can pretty good food elsewhere for a lot less.   Was it worth $200.00 per person for me? .... almost.  I liked the room.   It was quiet enough we could carry on conversation.   Everything was elegant, but in a modern muted sort of way.   The seats and table were perfectly comfortable.   The waiter, Peter was gracious, hospitable, entertaining and really knew the menu.   We opted for the Wagu  tasting menu for four with one additional steak and we had food to take home.    If you are staying in Vegas, request  a refrigerator for your Craftsteak leftovers.    All the steaks were perfectly cooked.   The  steak tartar was fabulous as was the prosciutto plate.   We ordered a shrimp cocktail, and that was a mistake.  We should have paid more attention when Peter was crafting our menu.    The shrimp were big and fresh, but it was ordinary.  The Caesar salad was good, with especially good anchovies but not the best I have ever had.      Steaks were the main course and all were terrific.    For sides we had a potato au gratin which was great, brussel spouts with some kind wildly good bacon and wild mushrooms.   The mushrooms were a big hit with several of us that appreciated them, but not for everyone.  The desserts, especially the chocolate souffle and a chocolate peanut butter dish were excellent.      Go on an expense account or after winning a big jackpot or for a very special occasion.    Otherwise, if you are like me, it is hard to really enjoy without thinking about the credit card bill you are going to get.",

We got a table with very little wait, they took our drink order and brought out these delicious fresh from the oven rolls. These rolls, are still piping hot when they get to the table, and they just melt in your mouth. At first bite, I knew things would go well.  We ordered our meals, and while waiting kept refilling our drinks and bringing us more rolls...I think we were starting to get full just from those amazing rolls.   Out comes our food. As a group of 3, we decided to order only 2 sides and slipt them between us, the sides are huge and easily fed the three of us. We ordered the asparagus and the potato gratin. Both were delicious.  For my main I ordered the t-bone steak, that thing filled up my plate, it was huge! Something I definitely was not expecting, most steakhouses give you such a tiny portion. The steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender I didn't even use the knife provided to cut it, wasn't needed it was that tender.  This place is definitely worth a visit.",

That fact that isn't want cooked all the way and the time between the starter and the main course were the only downsides. The food is amazing. Service is amazing. 10oz filet was cooked perfectly. Risotto was sooooo rich and the dish was a good size portion. Would recommend only one side for two people. The cauliflower was the best I've ever had. Definitely will be coming back. Better than when we had dinner at Cut in Beverly Hills and less expensive. Well worth the money.",

We ordered their Fall tasting menu which included appetizers (salad of roasted beets and pickled egg, warm goat cheese with red cabbage and saba, diver sea scallops with shaved fennel and lemon), main course of prime beef flat iron and roasted fillet mignon with sauce bordelaise, side dishes (roasted brussels sprouts with smoked bacon, butternut squash with sage, and sauteed shitake mushroom).   I normally don't eat beef, but I couldn't resist to try a tiny bite of the flat iron and the fillet mignon. The meat was really juicy and so soft that it just melt in my mouth. The scallops were perfectly cooked and super delicious. All the side dishes were excellent and in decent portion for five of us.   The tasting menu included the desserts of Chef's selection (cinnamon monkey bread, vanilla bean cheesecake, chocolate ganache cake... and some I didn't know the names.) All the food for just $85 per person (tax and gratuity are not included). The services was out of the world. We had three waiters served us and the food arrived our table in perfect timing. Although the dinner was a little pricey for my standard, I have to say that the food and service did worth it.",

    "text": "Maybe it's the lack of hair on chef Tom Colicchio's head that inspires him to dispense with the culinary smoke and mirrors and keep the cooking clean.  The thought behind Craftsteak's menu is so simple that every steakhouse in the country should be embarrassed not to have thought of it: quality meat, perfectly prepared.  But maybe that's the sign of great cooking -- so subtle, so simple that the taster delusionally believes anyone could cook it.  We had the filet mignon, dry aged t-bone and free range chicken.  Each dish was brilliant, filling, tasty--emphasizing the flavors of the meat.  Most people have never actually tasted the flavor of great meat, well prepared.  And Craftsteak is an excellent place to get an introduction to how amazing the flavor of well-prepared steak is on its own, without a sauce.  After you eat here, you will never try a lesser-quality steak house because they'll just seem like McDonalds with different flavoring.  But that's just the food.  The bar's whiskey menu is certainly worth mentioning as well with its well-stocked collection of Scotch, Irish whiskey, Bourbon and Canadian whiskey.  The night we were there, the bartender had a solid base of product knowledge and was able to expertly direct us around the whiskey menu.",

The meats were terrific, sides excellent, wine smartly chosen and plentiful and our server Marvin was pleasant and a pro.  Star count would have been higher but the surf in the surf and turf was overcooked lobster and not just a little overcooked.  Rubber city. We said something but were dismissed.  I would have made a bigger deal but did not want to ruin the occasion for the guest of honor.  When multiple guests complain and leave quite a bit of lobster on the table uneaten. there is a problem that they should have addressed.  Bill was well over $1200 and the lobster was $30 per person.  They should have eaten that loss because we certainly did not want to eat the lobster",

Since my friend got the room, I bought dinner here for the three of us. We all got the filet mignon, a couple side dishes, and lots of drinks. The menu is a la carte, so it can get a bit pricey. But you get to choose what you want and the sides are enough to feed several people.   The filets were amazing! They brought them out on a big cast iron skillet. Just the steak and nothing else. No fancy presentation needed. I've had better filets (not many better than that), but this is right up there with them as one of the best I have ever had. The food was amazing!  The atmosphere inside of the restaurant is very nice too. It is dark and very romantic feeling. A great place to bring your girl. The service was also very good. They have a fantastic wine list that is reasonably priced. I didn't have desert, because we filled up on our meal and drinks.  Next trip to Vegas and I'm stopping back in here again.",

The only thing better than eating steak at this restaurant would be to have sex afterwards... that's the perfect evening.   This place exudes romance, and I'm not talking about the cheesy Vegas style, I'm talking the real thing. The waitstaff was one of the best I've seen in years. You have a team of people waiting on you. We had team 4. The leader of team 4 was Kevin and he was excellent... courteous, funny, helpful, prompt, etc. Olga was the main woman getting our things and she did a very good job. There was only one mistake the whole meal and that was refilling a drink. She brought my friends drink instead of mine, but then Kevin came over and said don't worry about it, keep it, and here's your drink. Mistake corrected.   We decided to get the Three Course Domestic Wagyu Beef Meal for $130 a person. They were participating in the Three Squared meal event for $50 a person, but we opted to go for the gusto and get a better meal (and deal, at least in this place). They seem to be a big martini place. I'm not really a martini type of person, but, I thought when in Rome... So, I got the Expresso Martini. Sounds unique enough and I needed some caffeine to balance out my continual alcohol intake. Without a doubt, it was one of the best drinks I've had... and then had again. My friend had the Key Lime Martini... and it was excellent as well.   Now the food. The homemade starter rolls were good. They had that little touch by having some sea salt on them. But, don't do more than one. Despite our alcohol blood level, we knew to wait for the meal. We were then presented with our appetizer which consisted of Caesar Salad with Anchovies, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, and Shrimp Cocktail. The shrimp were the size of my hand and very good for being so large. The mozzarella was in a 25 year old port sauce... yumm.   Then, came the beef. We requested the ribeye and the filet. I guess I should back up a bit. The Domestic Wagyu Beef Meal is what the chef decides to throw together, but you can make suggestions, and we did... at least for the steaks. The steaks were exquisite. They were perfectly cooked, tender beyond belief, and the flavor... amazing. This course also came with Roasted White Corn... incredible, asparagus... good (for me, the one thing that approached average), and the Yukon Gold Puree Potatoes... worth every bite.   Since the devouring was done, the next course came, dessert. It consisted of: Cinnamon Monkey Bread, Pecan Toffee & Banana Brown Sugar Ice Cream... wow, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, Blueberries & Lemon Poppy Seed Tuile... it was seductively smooth, and a fresh fruit concoction with a Watermelon and a Rasberry Sorbet to end it all.   This is definitely a stop to make when in Vegas and in the MGM Grand.",

Well my fears never came to fruition. Craftsteak, from the moment we walked in and got seated was amazing.  We got the \"kobe surf and turf\" chef's tasting menu.  Unlike battali's place, everything was seasoned to perfection. The king hawaiian shrimp were amazing. The roasted red peppers, pancetta and caesar salad were also very good.  for the main course:  kobe rib eye and kobe skirt steak....wow i cant begin to describe party in my mouth, everything was cooked to perfection.   My one complaint (which is why i gave 4 stars) the poached lobster was very fishy tasting and very tough. But we mentioned it to the waiter and he corrected the problem immediately without any recourse. The sides were good, the asparagus was soo good, i wanted more, the mashed potatoes were kinda watery but also tasty.   for dessert:   we got 6 types of ice cream/sorbets, the chocolate molten cake and the monkey bread. All were superbly delicious.   All in all from service to food, this place is top notch and i will be dining here again real soon.",

We all were really tired from working a long successful day at the conference so we weren't really trying to get to creative on the menu front. But, wine... we put some brain power to that!   We decided on the Summer Tasting menu. It was $60 a person and so worth every penny! And required little planning on our part.  starters:  Shaved Fennel Salad, Grilled Quail, Vincotto, Buffalo Mozzarella with Red Pepper Caponata, Persian Cucumber Salad Main:  Prime Beef Flat Iron, Angus Skirt Steak, Diver Sea Scallops Sides: Yukon Gold Potato Puree, Sauteed Sweet Corn, Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms  Don't even get me started on the bread... OMG the bread!   And the Deserts were to die for - The chocolate cake was YUMMO! (Don't really recall the others that came - got kind of stuck on the chocolate  but, five or 6  were brought out!   We asked to be in and out in 1.5 hours so we could all go our separate ways to dream land at True to plan we were out the door right at 1.5 hours. Service was impeccable!",

How do they cram so much deliciousness into every bite!?  My girlfriend and I were there celebrating our anniversary and our head waiter did a great job of spoiling us.  Dessert (with wine pairing) was on the house and he was happy to take some photos of us when we asked.  He was attentive and calm and informative and just flat-out wonderful.  The food, service, and ambience were all top-notch.  Craftsteak made our anniversary truly special and I can't wait to go back.",

Our server sucked ass.  He got our drinks wrong, we had to ask for refills, and when we asked to be sat on the same side on the table he was snooty.  Ok dude, you are a waiter.  Don't be snooty with me.  Your job is to serve me - for the next 2 hours you are my personal slave.  Get my meal, smile, say yes to my every request and bring me another martini or I will bitch slap you.  Other than the shit ass service, the food was tasty delicious.  We got a Caesar salad that came with a little anchovy - cute but gross to me all at the same time.  You should skip this.  Save your calories and your dollars for the main course.  We got the big ass juicy rib eye, the amazing mushroom risotto that came covered with little toasted mushrooms, and the most amazing almandine green beans.  I would have stuffed myself with the green beans until I threw up if I could.  I ate so many of them that I had to skip dessert.    Watch out the photographer that comes around.  They want to charge you $90 for like 2 5x7 photos.  I think they photoshop those suckers.  I looked really good but why would I want to waste $90 on photos when I could get more green beans?",

They looked sweet from the glaze on top, but there was salt sprinkled on top.  Came here during Pacquiao-Cotto fight weekend so excitement was in the air at MGM. The restaurant was packed and everybody looked like they were having a good time.  With our party of 6, most of us ordered the surf and turf deal with respective sides. My gf and I got that along with the carrots and risotto.   Take note that the sides are HUGE and definitely family style. The filet mignon and shrimp was satisfying.  After feasting, we ended the night with chocolate souffle and ridiculous sized serving of coffee. Each person got their own french press!  6 people = $750. If you're looking for a lower priced steakhouse with a celebrity chef, I'd highly recommend StripSteak by Michael Mina at Mandalay.",

I would highly suggest a tasting menu, as things that you wouldn't have normally ordered will appear in front of you... and it will be GREAT!  Quail, homemade mozzarella, corn -- all ridiculously fantastic. I was interested in trying their mozzarella (which is SO worth it by the way), but I would not have thought of ordering the other two.  The tasting menu also provides for top of the line meat choices - different cuts, preparations and marinades.  Desserts were shadowed by the gastronomic greatness of the starters and entrees.",

The food is on par with SW, and in my opinion, a step up from Prime.  I would give SW a slight edge on service, and even with Bellagio.  For me, Craftsteak is more ideal for \"Happy Hour\".  In the early evening, enjoy the Kobe Beef tartar with a premium bottle of red wine.  Bring a bottle from home (corkage is $35), and the damage will be minimal.  If you're looking for something for than an appetizer, the American Wagyu Beef (Snake River Farms) is exceptional.  You could spend 250% more for their Japanese Wagyu (A5) Beef, but it isn't necessary.",

The menu was small but overwhelming...I wouldn't turn any of it away.  Because we couldn't narrow it down, we decided to do the fall tasting menu listed in Wakako's post.  I was expecting a small tasting of each item, what I got was a feast!  The Mozzarella melted in my mouth and the potatoes were something from a dream.  The steaks were delicious, but not the best I've ever had. The dessert course was somewhat disappointing, but by that point we didn't care!  We also did a wine pairing for each course which was def. the way to go.  $30 for three generous pours is a steal when the average glass of wine is about $14.    The service was excellent and both of our servers were eager to answer our questions and attend to anything we wanted without being annoying.  We were surprised how casual some people were dressed, I would recommend business casual but don't be alarmed when someone walks by you in shorts and a tank top...it's in a casino after all.    The worst part about the visit was the food we had to waste because our stomachs couldn't fit anymore! Great food and great company made for memorable evening that now holds a place in my top 5 meals of my life.",

We were seated at a table for two kind of in the middle. The noise level was a little high, which didn't really bother us, the table is pretty wide though and without the option to sit side by side made for some difficulty having any conversation. This was a little disappointing in that I had just rocked her world and she was so excited and it was difficult to share in that. The service was great, being addressed by name was a very cool touch. The food, mostly amazing, except her steak which was overdone and dry (upsetting to me a bit as this was her surprise dinner) but like a trooper she didn't let it ruin anything. I am not wealthy so this was a special night, I am hoping to be able to take her again (after some saving lol) and this time get her a properly cooked steak and maybe sit in a booth. This time, 3 star for the seating and the steak. I will reserve judgement and a 5 star rating for our next visit. Having been to Ramsey Steak we had pretty high expectations. As it sits now Gordon Ramsey Steak 1 Craft 0 hopefully we'll even that up next time.",

We also had the waygu tartare, lobster bisque, shrimp cocktail, assorted mushrooms, and various sides. We also enjoyed a bottle of wine a few cocktails and after dinner drinks. We ordered coffee and dessert and the coffee came. About 10 minutes later the dessert still hadn't arrived so I inquired to our server to which she immediately snapped at me asking me if I expected her to start over and brew me a new espresso. She also said she can't help when the dessert comes out. I like warm espresso with my dessert. Call me picky. Ok. First of all the food was AMAZING. I have no complaints about anything we ordered. What I as a customer have a huge problem with is having my 469$ dinner ruined by this servers snarky and just plain rude attitude. I left the restaurant in tears because it was our last night in Vegas we had such a terrific trip and the night was just left on a crappy note. This server is a sad representative of such a wonderful restaurant. Every other person we encountered was charming and went above and beyond to make it a great experience. We visited on Sunday April 3rd at 630 pm our servers name was Alexis. She was pretty rude from the beginning but the coffee thing was prompted this review.",

The sides were pretty good, although I guess after hearing so much about this place (didn't know it was the Top Chef guy's restaurant), I don't know what I expected, except I expected more?

    "text": "I cannot believe that this place is rated so high here. I went here after making some winnings. As a fervent fan of Top Chef, I wanted to give chef Tom Colicchio's restaurant a go. I must say, I was thoroughly disappointed.  The rolls and the mashed potatoes were okay, probably better than your usual steakhouse, but not something to rave about. After all, they were just rolls and potatoes.  We got the skirt steak, rib eye, and flat iron. They had issues with cooking the meat. We ordered everything medium-rare but both the rib and flat iron came out medium-well. I'm not one of those people who send back food all the time. (I'm always afraid that they might spit on the food, etc...although we are at a fancy place, I always like to take good precautions). But we paid a lot of money for the food and we wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  So we send the rib and the flat iron back, and wait for the next. Time ticks by and finally the 2nd round of the steak comes out. Still, they were bordering medium and medium-well. By this time, we were hungry and tired; we suck it up and eat it. The flat iron, they seemed to have missed the tough connective issue at one end. Very unacceptable for restaurants of this caliber. But I'm not a huge complainer, so we sucked it up and ate it. The rib was okay but just lost its tenderness from overcooking. And I think the steak didn't have time to properly sit before it came out as juices came flowing out when we made the first cut. Again, not acceptable.  The only saving grace was the skirt steak was really good, nicely prepared, properly seasoned.  I definitely would not come here again unless I hear that chef Tom Colicchio himself is doing some exhibition cooking.",

For this event, Gregg M and I decided to mainly walk around and network/engage in as much food/drink as we could.  The first course:  A selection of Waygu - three different cuts, all succulent and tender.  Across from it were other hors d'oeuvres to include onion rings, bruchetta (and a host of other things that appeared throughout the night that I fail to remember).  There were also some sushi/sashimi offerings in another room.  There were numerous wines presented from cabs to pinots (I'm sure there were a few whites, but I usually don't take up room in my stomach for those).  In addition to the wines, there was representation from Avion tequila and Bulleit Bourbon.  A very enjoyable evening and I even got my picture taken with the man himself.

The decor is elegant, unpretentious and very comfortable for a group to carry a conversation.  There were three of us and we were seated at a booth (which I love!).  We didn't go for the tasting menu which I kind of regret now...   All three of us ordered the grilled kobe skirt steak since none of us wanted to share.  We had a choice of several kobe beef and went with a medium priced Wagyu beef from Australia.  We all ordered it medium-rare and every single one came out perfectly cooked.  The meat was flavorful, tender and juicy (even the next day left-overs were!).  For sides, we got the puree, green beans and asparagus.  Everything was very simply made and with good flavor.  Overall, great experience and one of the best steak houses.",

I came here to dine with friends that are meat eaters and love steak.   I ordered the free range chicken and side lobster tail. Omg, it was so good! The chicken was tender and the dark meat portion of the chicken was even more tender than I anticipated. The lobster was phenomenal and the butter made it even more tantalizing.   The service here was Five Star, as we were serviced by not one, but three servers to fill our glasses and serve our food. The atmosphere seemed upscale and the ambience definitely was appropriate for this restaurant.   Overall, if you enjoy a good steak, my friends say to try the Wagyu Steak @ 295.00 a plate. I'd much rather suggest the lobster and chicken... Lol",

They literally de-crumb the table after courses and the wait staff works together to make the service flawless.  Prices: astronomical. Normally, I wouldn't even rate a place like this five stars since most average people couldn't even afford a meal here. Think like $100-150 minimum a person. We easily spent $500. And if you drink heavily, which we don't...a few soft drinks and a glass of wine...it will fastly (I know that's not a real word!) spike your bill!   Food was perfection: the filet, the ribeye and the whipped potatoes are all stellar and stood out as our faves.  They came tableside and snapped some photos and at the end, we caved and purchased them. They were extremely expensive also. It's a memory and we won't be back every month so we do it and we are happy we did.",

    "text": "Total disappointment.  I go to Las Vegas 3 or 4 times a year and go out for what I hope is an amazing dinner each night I am there.    I had such high expectations for this restaurant.  It was a very slow night so the service was ok. Someone was at our table every 2 minutes with more drinks or asking how everything was tasting.  The sides were mediocre at best.  The mushroom melody was a big disappointment.  That could have just been my personal tastes but I love mushrooms and I wasn't loving them this night.  The steak was the biggest problem.  Ordered a Wagyu Ribeye for over 100 dollars and it was terrible.  There was no marbleization at all.  When the manager came over to ask how everything was.  I asked her if our steak was a ribeye or a New York strip.  She said it looked like a NY Strip.  When I told her we ordered a ribeye she said she would check.  Instead of taking the steak to the back to verify with the kitchen she went to the computer to see what was ordered.  She then came back and said she was mistaken it was a ribeye.     We had tickets to a show that night so I didn't have time to argue the point.  I did call back at a later date and was told that if a ribeye is ordered there is no way I could have gotten a NY strip.  Not only was I disappointed with the food but the handling of a complaint was not done properly.    Needless to say I will not be going back to Craftsteak the next time I visit Las Vegas.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner here on 3/23. Had reservations and were greeted warmly by name by both the hostess and the gentlemen who lead us to our table. He moved the table for me so I could easily reach the booth and laid the napkin on my lap. You can tell people here take pride in their work.   The ambiance is soft lighting and not too loud. You can hold a conversation without worrying about the people next to you. We had two waitresses who were great. We had a little mix up with our drinks since the hubby decided he liked mine instead of the one he initially ordered. One waitress brought the wrong drink out when we ordered another round but the other noticed right away so we didn't even have to ask to switch them.   Now onto the food! I ordered the Lobster Bisque to start and the Diver Scallops for my entree. People are not exaggerating when they say the lobster bisque is the best they have had. The Diver Scallops were huge, sweet, and melt in your mouth. I honestly thought I was eating more lobster, and I'm happy I pushed myself to finish. I was not expecting such big portion sizes.   My husband ordered the Wagyu strip steak. He ordered medium well and it came out a little under. Nothing to worry about since the under done piece went to me ;) the steak was tender and delicious. There was a flavor that both he and I picked out that was different. Still don't know what it was but it confused our tastebuds a bit. However this mystery taste only had us going back for more.   During dinner they also brought out 4 rolls. You can tell they were brought right out of the oven and were amazing with the butter they brought along with it. I wanted to eat all of them but again, I was struggling to finish my scallops.   I am so glad we dropped the money to eat here. I'll dream about the food until the next time we can come back.",

    "text": "My NY daughter, who is fast becoming a food connossieur herself, was very interested in trying a restaurant by one of her celebrity chef idols, Tom Colicchio.  Although there are a few to pick from in Manhattan, she came with us to Vegas to have her first experience (and ours) in one of his restaurants.  For all of us, this was our one big splurge meal on the trip.  While not much in Las Vegas is reasonably priced anymore, we went here knowing this would be the case.  Overall, I give Craftsteak 4 stars, but as it honestly reminded me so much of Mastro's, I found myself comparison rating it up one side and down the other.  I really liked the food at Craftsteak, don't get me wrong, but I didn't think it was worth the prices they charged, and yes, they were more expensive than Mastro's.  They pretty much served the same types of entrees and sides, but I really think Mastro's is one cut above (no pun intended.....well, maybe a little).  Service was good, but nothing and no one will top Erin @ Mastro's in Thousand Oaks.  She was truly that notch above and made us feel like we were the King and Queen of dining.  We wanted for nothing.  However, the two male waiters @ Craftsteak were nice, but I often felt uncomfortable asking for their assistance, and they certainly weren't treating us all that special.  I think they stayed a little too much in the background, but yes, they got the job done.  I will say, however, when I did ask questions, they were forthcoming with their opinions of the food, and we were not steered wrong.  There was one aspect that was disappointing........both my younger daughter and I LOVE rack of lamb, and while it was on the menu and we wanted it, it was NOT available by the time we placed our order.  Big letdown.....but not the restaurant's fault, either.  Here is what we did order..........  32 oz. porterhouse steak, served with bearnaise sauce - at $96.00., it should have been outstanding, but it was very good.  The meat was a little tough in areas.  It became excellent with bearnaise sauce on it.  Well done on a sauce that I haven't had in YEARS.  LOVE that sauce.  Diver sea scallops - waiter recommended, and they were excellent.  A little light on flavor, but cooked to perfection.  Grilled asparagus - very nicely prepared and seasoned, and not too lemony as I feared it might be.  Asparagus is truly my favorite vegetable.  Roasted fingerling potatoes with rosemary - while not dried out, it needed some kind of sauce, and I was a little disappointed that the promised rosemary was not infused into the potatoes in a much bigger way, instead of just a sprig decorated on top.  I dipped them in the steak au jus, which was quite good.  If it were me ordering a potato side, this would NOT have been my choice, especially with all the choices available.....but my daughter selected, so this was what she chose.  Mushroom assortment (4 different kinds) -  a wonderful introduction into some exotic mushroom types - maybe could have been sauteed a little more, and perhaps with a bit more butter / flavor, but still, they were good.  Caesar salad with pickled anchovy - we ordered 2 caesar salads, which were split in half, and there was MORE THAN ENOUGH salad to go around between the four of us.  Very generous portions.  Not a huge fan of lettuce leaves in their whole form.  I much prefer the lettuce be cut already, but it also didn't detract from it for that reason.  What did detract was the ever-present lack of enough dressing issue.  Always happens.  What leaves did have enough dressing on them tasted just fine.  The pickled anchovy wasn't too bad, either, esp. if eaten sparingly.  For dessert, my daughters ordered chocolate souffles with caramel sauce and a simply divine hazelnut ice cream laced w/chocolate shavings.  The ice cream was TRULY amazing.  I didn't care too much for the souffle, though.  I think it was a bit undercooked.  Never been my thing, though.  My husband and I split the cinnamon monkey bread with sour cream toffee ice cream.  Not sure how I feel about this dish.  The ice cream was dreadful......waaaaaaaaaay too much on the sour cream.  Strange.  As for the monkey bread, yes, it was delicious, esp. with the ooey-gooey caramel sauce over it, BUT........I felt like I was eating a breakfast food item.  It just didn't smack of the stuff elegant nighttime desserts are made of.  I don't know, I just wasn't feeling it.  Because we were celebrating my younger daughter's birthday, they brought a complimentary cheesecake w/ a raspberry coulis.   While I have been somewhat critical of the food, overall, we definitely enjoyed our meal here.  However, for this restauranteur's celebrity status and the matching prices, I honestly expected better from him.  That being said, I would certainly return to this place.  I just can't give this a 5-star rating.",

The raw oysters were astonishingly fresh, the steaks perfectly prepared and the sides very good. We were in a hurry because we were off to a show after dinner and the staff took care of us in getting us fed and out the door.   My only complaint is we each ordered steaks and when they arrived they came in a cast iron casserole marinated in a wine reduction. Nowhere on the menu did it mention the steaks came prepared this way. I prefer my steak presented simple, no sauce, no garnish. The picky thing is there were no utensils to transfer the steak from the casserole to the plate, creating a moment of nervousness that I might drop a $60 piece of meat onto the floor when trying to stab it with my fork or splatter the wine sauce on my clothing.",

It is essentially family style with a HUGE variety. You get around 4 appetizers, 2 beef choices, 3 vegetables, and 4 desserts. This doesn't even includes the fantastic dinner rolls. Of the food we had, my strongest recommendations would be: Prosciutto San Daniele, Domestic Waygu Filet, Shishito Peppers, and the Cinnamon Monkey Bread.",

The menu was kind of confusing since there were four kinds of meat listed, and that's it.  We thought we'd each choose an appetizer, a steak, and a dessert...but we were wrong.  We kept asking our waiter, \"so, what comes with it?\" and he'd say, \"we like to do this this this this and this\" and we just nodded, not really understanding.  When we ordered the Angus beef chef's menu, we had no idea what we were in for.  We basically got EVERYTHING:  four appetizers, three steaks, and five desserts served family style.  We brought a nice bottle of wine to go with dinner ($35 corkage) and ordered martinis, but all the food soaked up any kind of buzz we could have had.  The highlight was the corn. Holy crap was that good.  It's just roasted corn, browned butter, white onion and green onion.  My tummy is still smiling.  Go to Craftsteak, order from the Chef's menu, then thank heaven for Tom Colicchio.  The only way it could have been better is if I ordered the Australian Waygu and Curtis Stone cut and fed it to me.",

Our waitress arrived shortly after we were seated and was exceedingly pleasant along with the rest of the staff who served us.  My date and I each got the three course Angus Chef's special (a little pricey at $119/person, but not ludicrous for this type of place). The meal choice was the best thing we could have done. Each course was a surprise of 4-5 dishes, all of which were delicious. Our cuts of T-bone and Rib eye steak were tender and seasoned to perfection. The cuts of wagyu beef are supposedly better, but it's hard to imagine the extra cost being worth it with how tasty our meals were. By the time our four dessert samples arrived, we were pretty full; however, we manged to try everything. Make sure you save room. It's worth it.  My only qualms about our dinner was it took longer than it should have to get our drinks and a long time to get our final check. Otherwise, I'd rate this 5 stars.

    "text": "Craftsteak was very disappointing. We did one of the sampler menu items. The ribeye was tough and way over salted. The breaded shrimp,first course, was dry and tasteless and the cocktail sauce was unremarkable.   The potatoes au gratin were so so and a little undercooked. The balsamic carrots were extremely tough- inedible. The  lamb chops, beet salad, and asparagus were phenomenal.  For less than the $110 per person, we could have gone to a Houston's or Ruth's Chris and gotten a much better meal. The server was in our face agressive.   I am not the kind of person to send the food back. I just will never go back to the restaurant.  I would have given this place 2 stars, but I feel ripped off.",

    "text": "I was really surprised we were even able to get reservations...we called less than a week in advance, had a group of 7, it was right after watching the Paquiao fight (which was also at MGM Grand). Plus, on top of all that, it's Tom Colicchio's restaurant!  I ordered the steak and lobster which came with half a lobster and filet mignon. The filet didn't really come with any sauce but it was cooked perfectly and went well with some side dishes. The lobster was excellent, very moist and tender. My bf was loving the lamb.   Overall I'd say it's 3.5 stars. Pretty standard steakhouse. The menu wasn't too innovative so there's no suprises there. I guess that can be either a good or a bad thing. If you like steak, you'll like this place. Great place for large groups in a semi-formal atmosphere. Everything is cooked perfectly, just the way you request it.",

    "text": "I'm drooling just thinking about this place... *DROOOOOL*  BEST STEAK OF MY LIFE!!!!  My boy took me here for my birthday. It was a GREAT gift!! =) Also, I'm a HUGE Top Chef fan so I was so excited to discover when I go there that this restaurant is owned by Tom Colicchio. =D  This place is for people with deep pockets (or shallow pockets filled with plastic! =D) and a PASSION for steaks. This place might be pricey but it's definitely worth the experience. =)  For starters...  Lobster Bisque: YUMMY!!! =) It tasted great! I just wish there was more of it! There were chunks of lobster in it also. I love this soup, but N9ne Steakhouse at the Palms Hotel was better.  Wagyu Beef Tartare: This was the first time I had eaten tartare. O... M... G... THIS IS A MUST HAVE ITEM!! I could eat this all day! The portion was surprisingly big AND filling. The wagyu beef is so tender. There's so much flavor in it. Even if I can't afford a whole meal here next time, I want to come here JUST for the tartare. I want some nooooow!  We were getting kind of full from the appetizers (and the bread they gave us), but we had to get ready for our entree...  Wagyu Beef Rib Eye: This was the KING of all steaks! Totally mouth watering! It had TONS of flavor. It came in a cast iron casserole pre-sliced. It was cooked a perfect medium rare. It was nice and moist and had nice grill marks on the outside. I definitely suggest to try this if you've got the funding for it (the steak alone costs about $100).  Sauteed Mushrooms (Side): The sides come seperately here. Great mushrooms. It's hard to go wrong with sauteed mushrooms though. =P It went with the steak very well.   The grand total for two appetizers and ONE steak for the two of us to share came out about $200 (including tax and tip). One day I'll come back and be able to afford a steak for EACH person. =P A girl can dream!",

He definitely kept his promise. Customer service was supreme. we had two waiters who catered to us. both were very knowledgeable with the food, wine, and steak. One guy was even giving us a history lesson on vegas and the strip and the casinos...so that was super interesting!",

    "text": "The dinner was good but there are a few blemishes which knocked them down to average. For an expensive steakhouse like this, I expect good service and everything to be cooked to perfection.  We were promptly seated. I was drinking a house Pinot Noir which I started at the bar - $17/glass for Meomi which is a screw top bottle which can be purchased for $17/bottle outside of the restaurant. It was tasty, just surprising that they charge premium prices for a low end wine which doesn't even have a cork!  Starters - I had the heirloom tomato salad which was divine, though it was drenched pretty heavily with olive oil. I scraped most of the oil off the tomatoes and thoroughly enjoyed the dish.  My companion had the cucumber spinach salad which he said was average - nothing special.  The bread was very good and tasted fresh baked out of the oven.  Entrees - I had the filet mignon which was good, but surprisingly not stellar. I like my steaks to have a nicely seared outside with a medium rare center. The sear was not as good as I have had at other steak houses - but then I'm from Texas and we know how to do steaks right here. My companion had the salmon which he said was incredibly average. He regretted not ordering the steak.  Sides - All sides were served family-style with large portions for everyone to get their fill. The brussel sprouts were yummy and the risotto was fabulous. In fact, the risotto was the best thing we had. We also ordered the Hen of the Woods mushroom sides since neither of us had tried it before. I enjoyed it but my companion thought the taste was a little strong - I believe the preparation was done well, it was just personal preference. I wish I had tried the mushroom sampler instead but hindsight...    Service - After appetizer plates were picked up, the new plates which were sat on the table for us were dirty - they actually had dried food on them!!!  We finally flagged the server and let him know and got new plates. I also sat for some time with an empty wine glass until we could flag our waiter.  Towards the end of the meal, our waiter just disappeared and then we were being served by another waiter who offered us dessert (we didn't have time or tummy room) and eventually brought us our check. I thought maybe our waiter left or something but I saw him waiting on other tables. Weird. Maybe he was embarrassed about the dirty plate thing? We weren't mean or anything, so I don't know.  So the meal was good, it just wasn't stellar and I don't think the food and service merit the hefty price tag. I don't mind paying for a good steak dinner, I just want to make sure I get value for what I'm paying. I don't think this restaurant *quite* cuts it, though the meal was tasty overall.",

    "text": "This is what a five-star restaurant review feels like. Been a while. Nice to get reacquainted.  So let me set this up. I visited the CraftSteak in NYC a few years ago for lunch, but that was for the burger, and while it was very good, I didn't go rushing back partly because there are so/too many options in NYC, plus it closed to make way for Collichio & Sons (high on the list).  Flash forward to Vegas. Even though it's the buffet mecca, celebrity chef restaurants top the list for me out there. So when my buddy Big J, who's a regular here, invited me to join him and Adam the Pimp, I instantly said hell yeah what time.   The place was not full when we arrived at 6pm, but it had totally filled by 8pm when we left, following a quick tour of the kitchen and meeting the head chef (Matt Seeber, not Colicchio, btw). In those two hours, I had one of my Top 10 dining out experiences.  Craftsteak produced by far the best damn lobster bisque and steak I've had. The bisque had several plump lobster chunks, not those little bits you often get, and the flavor was exceptional. I don't get excited about soup. This was special.   But the real star was the 12 oz. Wagyu Skirt Steak. Served medium rare, by the first bite, I rediscovered that special happy place that a great steak transports me to, but something was different this time. As I kept eating, I realized I'd not had a steak that delicious before. I even closed my eyes a few times to shut out one of the key senses and focus more intensively on the taste. Pimpski, who also ordered the skirt steak, concurred that this was like a steak apex. Big J was going to town on the surf and turf, but had recommended the skirt, so it we'll call it unanimous (along with many other reviewers).   The sides were also fantastic. Loved the Yukon gold puree potatoes and asparagus, but we all agreed that the braised Brussels sprouts with smoked bacon was the standout.     Dessert didn't miss a beat, either. The monkey bread gets a lot of love, but I tried a new bread pudding that wasn't on the menu yet, and like the lobster bisque, it stood apart from every other version I've had of this classic. It was much lighter than most, and was the perfect ending to the meal.  That the service was uniformly excellent throughout didn't seem to have anything to do with my friend being a regular. Looking around at surrounding tables and booths, the servers were constantly moving, bringing dishes at the right time, refilling water and drinks, and asking how things were, just as they were with our table. Combined with the overall ambiance, the service created a very welcoming and comfortable atmosphere.   Others have touched on the prices, which are also on the menu, so you should already know what you're in for there, but I'll add this: It's not just the dollar amount, but the total value of the meal and the overall experience. For me, Craftsteak was top-flight in every respect and it'll be high on my list with every future trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "My wife and I had dinner here last month.  We are both Top Chef fans and had been looking forward to trying this place for some time.    I feel led astray by the good reviews for this place.  The service was ok.  My wife thought not very attentive and had grown impatient with it by the end of the meal.  She pointed out our server had really only been by twice during the meal- when the food arrived and at the end- so maybe she was right.  I think the best part was the start.  The rolls here are fabulous.  I give them that.  Really delicious.  I started with the lobster bisque which was also very good.  I would recommend that.  But then the main course.  On recommendation I got the skirt steak.  Now I know skirt steak has a different texture to it but I thought mine was extremely tough.  I really didn't enjoy it and had to frankly spit a few bites out.  I wouldn't get it again nor would I recommend it as so many others here do.  I overheard a woman seated in the next table over also complain about how tough her steak was.  So I don't think this was an anomaly.  Maybe we both got bad cuts, I don't know.     My wife got the rib eye.  I tried a bite and definitely liked it better than my skirt steak.  But my wife thought it was just so-so, nothing great.  The sauce served with the steak was very good though.  That was probably the only saving grace.  I would have been happier with a different steak I think.  I wanted to try the souffle for dessert but just wasn't up for it by the end of the meal.  My wife and I shared some chocolate sorbet.  It was good but just sorbet.  We were both disappointed with the meal and decided we would not go back.  This place has a lot of hype behind it but frankly I have had much better steaks and meals at chain-type steakhouses.  For instance we have repeatedly gone to Smith&Wollensky in Vegas and never gone away disappointed.  There are so many choices in Vegas that are superior to this based on my experience.",

    "text": "Huge disappointment.   When you go out for an expensive steak dinner, the one thing that matters most is the steak, right? If that is done poorly, nothing else really matters.   I went here with a party of 7, and 4 of our steaks were poorly done. Mine was so bad I had to send it back - twice! I ordered it medium rare, and it came back overdone. It was solidly medium, and probably on the well side of medium. At a Sizzler-type place I would have just eaten it, but this place is called 'CRAFTsteak', so presumably they should be able to get it right. I genuinely tried to be polite about it, and our waiter assured me that if I wasn't happy with it, I should absolutely send it back. I waited 20 minutes for the replacement, and when it came it was lightly seared on the outside and totally raw 1 millimeter in. That absolutely felt like a 'fuck you' from the kitchen. One other guy at our table also sent his first one back. At least his second came back right. Two others said theirs also weren't what they wanted, but they didn't want to bother with waiting for a new one.  The icing on the cake was the manager. He came by when my second steak arrived and had the gall to tell me that my black-and-blue steak looked 'maybe a little underdone' from medium rare. The most he tried was to offer us a free dessert. That's a straight-up Applebee's move, not what you should have to deal with at a premium place like this.   Two stars instead of one because at least three of our seven steaks were cooked the right way. The sides were fine, and our drinks were good. The service was mediocre.   A place like this should have better odds than a roulette wheel.",

    "text": "Here's the short version of the review: my friends and I ordered the domestic wagyu beef tasting menu.  We expected steak.  We were given melt in your mouth butter that looked and tasted like steak.  We were amazed.  Here's the long review: we walked in a little before our reservation time, and were instantly escorted to our table.  The place is dimly lit and well decorated, but whoever told them they to play cheesy elevator music at a fine restaurant should be fired.  I mean, seriously?  As soon as I walked in I felt like I should be hitting a close door button.  We got some rolls baked up in this little pan.  Cute, but also warm and buttery.  The domestic wagyu tasting menu is the cheapest of the three tasting menus, with the others increasing in price due to the quality of the meat.  The most expensive is the \"real\" Kobe beef tasting menu (wagyu, as I understand it, is non-Japanese \"Kobe-style\" beef).  We noticed it only came with three courses.  Isn't this supposed to be a tasting menu?  The waitress assured us we'd have plenty of food, enough to feed three \"big\" guys.  Jeez, was she right.  The first \"course\" was actually three dishes: a caesar salad, grilled shrimp, and an absolutely stunning kobe beef tartare.  Raw beef topped with a raw egg, mixed together and eaten with toasted bread.  Sounds gross, right?  Wrong.  It's f***ing AMAZING.  The shrimp and the caesar were both good, but paled in comparison to the tartare.  Then came the main course: three different cuts of wagyu beef: ribeye, skirt steak, and fillet mignon.  They were all amazing to varying degrees.  Each one was perfectly seasoned, so tender you could almost cut it with the side of your fork.  We almost came to blows over each quickly vanishing piece.  The skirt was the winner, and the fillet the loser.  We had a pretty philosophical conversation as to why, but the general consensus was that fillet mignon's strength generally isn't taste, but tenderness.  When you get to a piece of beef as awe inspiring, as tender as wagyu and Kobe, the strengths of fillet mignon tend to diminish.  The beef (and knife fights) behind us, we were pressented with desert.  Maybe I was way too full at this point, but the final part of the meal just didn't live up to the rest.  We got a plate of ice cream and sorbets (which included a wonderfully light pineapple sorbet that with a texture reminiscent of a frozen cloud), a chocolate molten lava cake (meh), a blueberry tart (double meh), a plate of sweet fruit (perfectly ripe and in season), and \"monkey bread\" with a side of caramel dipping sauce (the sauce was the dessert winner; we ended up dunking pretty much all our other bites of dessert into it).    It was pretty expensive (menu priced at $130 a head), but the amount of food, and the absolute quality of it all made it well worth it.  This place is pure class and exquisite taste.... just ditch the damn elevator music.",

Good job, Tom Colicchio!  Not sure if they still have this menu (I'm sure they offer a similar tasting menu year round) but when me and the boyfriend went, we got the family style tasting menu for $75/person.   The ambiance of this restaurant wasn't too spectacular. They just had booths, large tables, nothing out of the ordinary. But once we started getting our food, we started to really enjoy ourselves...  They start you off with these hot dinner rolls glazed in butter and dusted with some salt. OMG so good. And then comes the FIRST COURSE which included a lobster bisque, caesar salad, roasted red peppers, and proscuitto. The best of these was definitely the soup! I loved the many chunks of lobster in this creamy goodness.   The main course included grilled kobe surloin, angus beef skirt steak, and sea scallops. All were cooked very well and tasted delish! The side dishes that come with were the sweet potato puree, artichokes, and spinich. YES, you get ALLLLLLLL of these! This meal seriously could have served at least 4 people and all for 75/person!!   By the time dessert rolled around, we barely even touched it, although when I think about it now, I should've! We shared the monkey bread and some type of espresso ice cream. From the little tastings we had of it, it was very good!   We loved the meal so much that we took all of the leftovers back to the hotel room (where I completely passed out from food coma) and had to take them along with us on our 6-hour drive back home. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!",

So.. go ahead and read the other reviews for what to order.  I'll review the adult beverages.

And the dangerous part is that they taste so delicious, you don't think twice about going for the second, third, or fifth martini.. even though it's $13 a drink (ouch.. don't they know we're in a recession?).  Despite the price of the drinks, they are worth every penny.  My last trip there I tried the espresso martini, and the first word that came out of my mouth was \"wow\".  And then \"wow\" again.  All I could say was \"wow\", to die for.  If you don't want to shell out the money to have a nice meal here (and you can easily drop a few bills on dinner), go for dessert.  Order the creme brulee with an espresso martini.    Sidenote: midway through my second martini, I started getting the munchies.  I wondered if I asked for bread if it would be free.. and indeed it was.  Not only was it free, but it was soft, buttery, lightly sea salted, and heavenly.  The end.",

My friend was a huge top chef fan so he insisted we check this spot out.  Our entire table ordered the Kobe Tasting Menu and I was not disappointed.  All the steaks were amazing, my two favorite was the Filet Mignon and Skirt Steak.  The appetizers that we were served was nothing impressive.  Roasted red peppers, Prosciutto ( I can get buy that at a deli), mixed greens, and an artichoke dish defintely did not wow me at all.  The sides were decent.  The desserts were amazing tho.  Make sure you get some Monkey Bread that was one of the best deserts i've ever had.    Overall, i go to a steakhouse for steak and they had some of the best tasting beef i've ever had.  Would definitely reccomend it.",

Unfortunately, our party wasn't seated until about 45 minutes after our reservation but we were served complimentary tequila shots during the hiatus which was fine with us.  The staff was incredibly friendly, understanding and showed lots of personality.  Despite the long wait, this is still one of my only 5 stars I've ever given on Yelp.  I ordered the Japanese A5 Wagyu medium rare and I swear to everything it made my soul cry.  So wonderful and perfectly cooked, this was an experience to remember.",

I selected the Platinum Kobe tasting menu, this is the middle tasting selection.  I am forgetting exactly what was served, but what I do remember was Kobe Beef Tartare, Scallops, Strip, Rib eye, Skirt selections, Potato Puree, Bread Pudding, and Chocolate Lava Cake  The stuff I was forgetting was also superbly prepared but not as memorable to me personally.  The service was outstanding and the wait staff was very helpful with the questions I asked.  I plan on visiting more of the many top notch steak joints I hear LV has just to see if they can match this meal or do it one better, its going to be hard though.",

    "text": "Craft steak was flawless in every way.  I arrived with my party about 10 mins early just in case there was a wait.  As I sat there I noticed the interior, perfectly classic steak house, wood everything.  Dark oaks, redwoods and even pine.  Aw the faint smell of wood finish is unmistakable and wonderful when you sit down to a hearty meal.  There is just something about the smell of pine and oak that goes with a 12oz steak.  Our server came over to us promptly and introduced himself.  Charm filled the room, every wait staff had a smile ear to ear.   The Floor manager came over next.  We were all dressed in business attire and casual wear, nothing special at all.  After all it was 110 degrees outside so some of us were in shorts.  None of this stopped him from coming over.   He just came over to introduce himself and make sure everything was to our liking.   We started our meal with artisan breads. The favorite of the table was the kalamata rosemary bread. Wonderfully salty and airy, perfect way to get us to drink 2 more cocktails each.  A good restaurateur will understand the need to up sale through cocktails and a good way to do that is salty snacks,  I had the New York strip with Natural Ju and Thyme.   It came sliced into perfect  inch cubes with a  inch fat cap still attached.  All I could think was thank god you kept the fat on there.  I got a side of roasted mushrooms with my steak. I'm a sucker when it comes to mushrooms, especially when they are prepared as simple as possible. They were simply pan roasted in clarified..... also known as liquid gold.  All in All for experience, atmosphere, food and service they get a 5, but when I go into a place like this I expect nothing less then a perfect evening.",

Then service we received from a dream tandem of Victor and Edgar was exquisite. Spoiled was an understatement! The prices were reasonable for fine fining and premium product. Sides were were a little price for the portion size but taste oh wow. I had a 10oz filet butterfly and melts in you melt and yukon potatos. Arguable in my 34 years my best potatoes outside of grandmas. My better half had a surf and turf and lobster didn't even need butter with a side of finger lings. Nice selections of wines and all beverages. Finished off with a caramelized banana cake and cinnamon ice cream. No alcohol check was $165 so w/ service and my top a shade over $200. Well worth it.

With most steaks around a very reasonable $50, it didn't break the bank either. The mushroom risotto was the standout dish of the night (and comes with just as much hen of the woods mushrooms as the equally priced mushroom side). The sweet pepers and the potatoes gratin were quite popular as well. The bearnaise sauce was not so good.  We called around 4pm without a reservation and they were able to accomodate our group of 9 at 5pm without a problem.",

For the full review and great photos of everything served go to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kats9lives.com%2F2008%2F09%2Fgreatly-surprised-cant-beat-price.html&s=da7d84bb080a64c9c276881a4bde704889cc070083ff16a84690807e5d64d792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">kats9lives.com/2008/09/g...</a>  I will break it down simply what we got and what we liked.  Be sure to make reservations before you go just in case there is a convention going on.  Heck who are you kidding.  It's Vegas, there is ALWAYS a convention going on.  =P  Summer Menu ~First Course    Roasted Red Peppers = so-so good flavor *just a reminder I am a Meatatarian*   Persian Cucumber & Watercress Salad = so-so and fresh   Grilled Quail = SIMPLY FABULOUS  ~Second Course   Kobe Sirloin = good, but needed more flavoring... the meat was okay but I really wish you could have paid more to get filet mignon   Roasted Chicken = goodI guess, needed more flavor as well   Diver Sea Scallops = cooked well, flavor was fine  ~Dessert   4 Ice Cream = the flavors were lacking and it was really icy   Warm Fruit Crisp = so-so the crust could have been a lot better   Cinnamon Monkey Bread = not bad, the sauce was good  ~Extra Appetizers we ordered...   Wagyu Beef Tartare = soft texture and flavorful   Seared Foie Gras = good size, flavor was not bad   Okay for $60 dollars per person you get 4 courses with 3 items in each course.  It's like a 12-course meal! What a great deal! We really didn't need the extra appetizers because we were stuffed.  There is just so much food that it's incredible.  Maybe it's because we are a group of two?  Still, tons of food and great.  I will definitely be back again and if you have never tried then you should really go!  I watched Top Chef when it first came out and I really questioned if Tom Colicchio knew anything about food.  Now that I have been there I will give him props.  When I was in NY his restaurants didn't look tempting but now my mind has changed.    If you are looking for more people to make a party of 4 for the better tasting menus give me a call and I will be there! ^_^",

If there was a place that served smashed ass***** I bet you it'd be the best darn smashed whatsits around.  We dined here with two friends we were travelling with and I had high expectations with this place given my experiences dining at its neighbors added to the fact that Tom Chollichio was at the helm.  The service was average. Despite the price tag ($150 for just my wifes entree) I never felt like our service was above and beyond.  I ordered a plate of prosciutto to start and a filet. The prosciutto was good, but I expected something with it like cheese or bread. Something so I wasn't just cramming slices in my mouth.   My steak was relatively bland. I ordered medium  and what I got was pretty rare. I didn't mind enough to send it back, but I was a little shocked that a chef at this high caliper of a restaurant couldn't manage to cook steak to temp.   My wife ordered a huge...huge lobster tail, which on the flip side was not only amusingly large, but also very good!  The decor seemed to be showing sign of age. Not that I felt that it was out dated, but literally it was falling apart. There was a few rips in the seat fabric of our booth and the wall decorations were worn out.",

The server was not knowledgeable nor could offer any helpful advice on what to order.  Halfway through the meal he disappeared and we did not see any waitstaff at our table for at least twenty minutes. Though at the end of our meal, a more pleasant waitress did show up.  The food was very bland, I felt that the asparagus was over cooked and the mushrooms still had a gritty feeling in them.  My beef ribs seemed like they were marinated in the dead sea.  Salt is not the answer for every meal.    At the end of the meal, my boyfriend and I were not pleased with the food and felt like we should have went to a mediocre restaurant like Outback down the street, because at least it matched our expectations.  My boyfriend wish we could go back in time and instead chose that route and used the money instead to buy me the matching DY ring that we saw a few hours ago.  Instead I have this yelp review.",

    "text": "Seriously Tom Colicchio shouldn't be judging anyone or maybe he just sold the naming rights (and maybe has never eaten here)...  Las Vegas in general has been a big disappointment when it comes to celebrity and Michelin starred restaurants. I rarely find the Las Vegas versions to live up to the hype.  We had a little time to kill and we booked an early reservation before our flight. We own a rental at the Signature and this place was on our cheat sheet for discounts we get with our M Life Curated Living status (10% off).  We got the shrimp cocktail, the ribeye, brussels sprouts, and the broccolini.  The shrimp cocktail...hmmmmm.....OK if you get the shrimp cocktail at a steak place I'm expecting large if not monster size shrimp....what you get here is a small *pile* (5 or 6 shrimp)...the shrimp look exactly like the same shrimp I see in the buffet...seriously a small pile of buffet shrimp...  ...and that wasn't even the worst thing about the shrimp... If you are going to serve buffet shrimp the sauce needs to save the experience. You need an awesome sauce...NOPE! We got some sort of ketchup sauce (it was similar to the sauce you find in the supermarket in the jars with the super tiny shrimp but a lot more ketchup like)... but wait there is more...they were so cheap with the ketchup sauce you get a little spoon to sparingly rub some of the ketchup sauce on...  OK...this isn't going very well...  Then the ribeye, brussels sprouts, and the broccolini came out.  The ribeye was fine. Was it better than the steak at Denny's...absolutely! I prefer this steak better than the Denny's steak. Is it the best steak? no. Is it worth $60? no.  The brussels sprouts were OK in a trying to make brussel sprouts your kids would eat kind of way.  The broccolini was more disappointing than the shrimp cocktail. It was like someone halfway cooked it, dumped it on the plate, and then that same someone said oh $#@t this is suppose to have some red pepper and then sparely putting a little on the plate.  This experience began and ended with disappointment...  The only thing that saved this was the staff. The staff was amazing. So 5 stars for the staff.",

    "text": "We wanted to wrap up a fun night in Las Vegas with some steak and TC's craftsteak did a decent job of this.  I have tried multiple steak restaurants from around the world and the T-Bone at Craftsteak was fairly juicy and delicious. The only downside was that it did not come with any sides and everything had to be ordered separately.  The Italian Buffalo Mozzarella salad we got was surprisingly small but the butter buns were a nice addition to the meal. Overall if we spent around UAD$120 for the meal in the picture.  Service was prompt and environment was nice.",

Atmosphere is dark wood, mood lighting, and a very open dining room.  Going on a Sunday night, you might expect it to be quite.  Quite the opposite - it was a steady stream of patrons and stayed busy throughout our meal.  We kept our meal simple - Caesar salad, filet for me, bone-in for him, couple of sides, and dessert.  Each item was on point and delicious.  I would definitely consider going back again next time we're in town.",

The starters were tasteless, we had the beet salad - just beets on a plate and the foie gras which was ok but did not come with the usual toast points. Then the entree - we ordered the roasted NY strip medium for $67.00 which tasted very gamey and was mostly rare with lots of fat and little meat. Regret not sending it back!!! We ordered the grits as a side and had to return them because they were like paste and not creamy, buttery and rich. Really not worth the $200 bill, went to Nathans afterwards as we were still hungry. Save your money and go to Texas Roadhouse!!",

When at a higher end steak restaurant not really sure that Whitesnake or even Van Halen are appropriate. But we came for the food  The rolls tasted no better than ones you get at the supermarket. I ordered a NY Strip and the honey glazed carrots. Took too long for them to arrive. Steak was average at best. Nothing to justify the price for sure. The carrots were either not done or over done depending on which bite you had and they tasted blah. Again for $16 I expected amazing for the carrots.  Overall will not ever visit again. Outback beats this place!!",

The Manager tried to smooth things over and i received a NY Strip A5 which was much better but nothing like the Wagyu cuts I have had in other locations at a far cheaper price point. It was a bad experience and arguing with me when I am going to put down a lot of money for dinner doesn't do well for a tip.  All in all a bad experience, I hope when and if i go back i will have a better experience.",

    "text": "Tom Colicchio is a certified culinary genius... I've had only the highest regards towards and utmost respect for him since watching him on Top Chef, but to experience his cuisine was a marvelous adventure...  His philosophy is to make simple food that is executed perfectly, and he does so flawlessly. The shiitake mushrooms were prepared beautifully, the sunchokes were crispy and cooked in a way I had never encountered (in the best way), the buttered salted bread... oh the bread. The bacon and egg salad was easily one of the best salads I've ever had. The waiter mixed the egg in front of us and, despite our confusion, we were very pleased with the result.. a salad abundant in texture, flavor and just pure happiness..  The steak was beautiful. Perfect amount of sauce, and worked incredibly well with both of our sides. I could not have enjoyed this place any more. Simple, perfectly executed food presented in a classy environment with Craft's signature lights to give a nice warm tint to the dining area. Top Chef may be a reality TV show, but Tom Colicchio is a real kick ass chef with superb talent and passion that shines through in his dishes. To Tom, and to my expanded stomach!",

    "text": "This review references the Las Vegas outpost of the vast Craft empire!  I have nothing but respect for this growing colony of celebrity chef Tom Colicchio's.  Why? Simply because without regard to hype, hyperbole or the need to pander to artifice or pretention, chef Colicchio has created oases where the ingredient is the star and everything else from decor, service and even preparation collaborate to highlight that dry-aged beef or Kumamoto oyster.     The only man-made creation is the Monkey Bread of which Craft can be justifiably proud.  Do not leave Craft without luxuriating in this creation of corpulent flavor!  It is certainly the taste bud's equivalent of seeing the Northern Lights for the first time!  Texture, flavor, and aroma all collude to lead you to the inevitable conclusion that life, despite its pointy ends, is good after all and that yes, America can be great again.  Like I said, you'll find details about the service, ambiance and overall experience at Craftsteak in other finely crafted reviews by enthusiastic Yelpers, I just wanted to drop a few lines in as an editorial of sorts to flesh out the reasons for why Craftsteak means so much to me and why it should be more than just a chophouse to you.  Oh, by the way, reservations are a good idea.  Be kind, OpenTable already has this whole reservation thing distilled down to a few swipes.",

Everything was delicious (the almond green beans might be the only marginal option we tasted but...).   Our table had the braised short ribs, scallops and filet for main course. All were cooked to perfection and absolutely mouth watering. Starters and sides did not disappoint. The wrapped pears were just the right starter and the salads were light but don't fill up on starters as the meals and sides are enormous.   The wine was delicious, the potato puree is a must order and if you possibly saved room for dessert...well I don't know why they have a dessert menu because you won't have room.",

    "text": "The reservation was easy to make. Overall, the staff treated us very good until the end of our dinner.  But, the rest of my evening was just average. Since I booked this far in advance, there should not have been any issues with me arriving 5-10 minutes late, even after I called to see if it was okay to still come. When I arrived, the hostess said we may not be able to take your party. Which was interesting because I had already spoken to her 5-10 minutes ago, and was told to come down---everything was fine. Also, the reason I was even late was that the place was so hard to find in the first place.  So, here's my feedback on the food. The filet mignon were very good. However, the mashed potatoes and asparagus was not cooked properly. The mashed had too much water and was like soup. The asparagus was too, too, chewy.   Worst part of the night was the 40th birthday dessert. They brought out two small chocolate chip cookies (the kind from a dollar store). This didn't bode well. This was bad...they could have just let me order something. I didn't care about it being free. The presentation sucked.  To that end, I recommend that you only eat the steak and order nothing else. And, show up an hour early. Try GPS to find this place.",

We were delighted with the non pretentious service and quality cuts of steak.   We started with cocktails and the wagyu tartar. Unbelievable, the tartare was velvet. I can't really describe how delicious this was. Hopefully my pictures do it justice.   As mains we shared the 40oz rib eye. Cooked medium rare it was nothing short of perfection. This was a huge portion for two, could easily be shared with three to four people.  We had French fries and Brussel sprouts for sides. The French fries were forgettable but the Brussels were great    Order a bottle of Shafers wine which is always an excellent choice.   This is not a cheap steakhouse by any means. Bill was $500,  worth it for a great night out. Server was great. I would highly recommend for anyone in Vegas looking for quality cuts of steak.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Craft was in 2015 while visiting Vegas for an event, it was sooo good I went twice that week, back to back. Now, every time I visit MGM, Craft has become a regular stop. Yet, each time I go back the overall experience gets worst every time. This year I have been to Craft twice.  The first time this year the food just didn't really meet my expectations that I had of the restaurant. First off, the bread rolls to start the evening were hard and cold as if they had been sitting out for hours. Usually the bread rolls were one of my favorite staples of Craft because they are usually soft and taste fresh and straight out of the oven. After being slightly disappointed of the rolls, it came time to order food. I was in a party of 5, and all of us were quite disappointed with our meals. For some reason, nothing that we ate that night seemed fresh. Now this might be do to the time we came in the restaurant as it was very close to the end of the night. But a restaurant is a restaurant and should take pride in every dish that comes out of the kitchen, no matter the time! This brings me to my next issue with Craft. Not too long ago, I went to Craft with a group of friends and family (a total of 7). This time the food was much better than my previous experience, and everyone cleared their plates completely. But, the Craft servers were very unintelligent. We had asked our server to set up an extra placemat for one more guest that was planning on showing up, our server set up the placemat but neglected to tell or inform that the kitchen was closing. So, upon arrival of our 8th guest, we had called over our server for him to take the order, but when he came over he said that the kitchen has been closed....I understand that the kitchen closes at a certain time, but, most restaurants inform the guests when the kitchen is closing so if there is anything we want we should ask for it now, ESPECIALLY since we had a placemat set up for someone who was planning on enjoying a delicious meal.   No feel from the staff",

We also had the A5 wagyu new york steak and pretty much the rest of the steak menu as well, but they were okay.   Lobster bisque is really fishy, don't recommend. Salads are also meh, don't really recommend. Can't go wrong with their potato sides as well. When in season, I hear their white corn is good.   Steaks would be better if the plates were dabbed in herb butter and about 2x hotter.   For dessert, get the monkey bread.   Steaks 4/5. Atmosphere 4/5. Service 4/5.",

Highly recommend starting with the lobster bisque, creamy and flavor-filled! Martini's are also made perfectly (I had vodka, dirty) and comes with a top-off! For dinner, focused on the waygu skirt steak, mushroom medley, & potato puree. The skirt steak was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth! And to top it off the service was impeccable (which I am a stickler for). Waiter shared a background on Tom Calicchio (I requested) and made some great suggestions, restaurant manager made his rounds to ensure restaurant satisfaction, in addition to constant coverage. Overall experience was definitely worth the slightly high prices.",

Wish they would serve a side or two included on the steaks but not taking away a star for that. Terrific meal, great bar too. Without a doubt..the best caesar salad ever too. crisp romaine delish with dressing...excellent",

Yes, I know it's a \"hotel restaurant\" but if you have that mentality you're missing out on the best things in life. First, their martinis are magnificent. And, both times I have had their steak tartare...this is significant to this establishment. The fresh quail egg does the trick. Moreover, I must recommend the scallops; they are extraordinary. You will find many great steak establishments will have equally great seafood. Stop here and enjoy a drink and an appetizer (especially the tartare) at least! Have fun!",

The restaurant is very nice, and the servers were extremely attentive. I ordered the lobster bisque to start with, and it was incredible. Fresh chunks of lobster meat drowned in a creamy and delightfully complex bisque. Every spoonful was delicious, from the initial flavor to the aftertaste. I'm not sure what exactly is in that bisque, but it is seasoned beautifully. Easily the best lobster bisque I have ever tasted.  The Caesar salad with picked anchovies was quite good.  The steak was also very good. I ordered the Double R t-bone, and it was cooked perfectly. Definitely a sous-vide steak: charred nicely on the outside, and a uniform medium rare doneness on the inside. I wasn't crazy about the slightly sweet sauce that accompanied the steak. Other than that, it was fantastic.  Overall, this is a fantastic steakhouse. The steaks are great, but in my opinion, the lobster bisque overshadows the beef. Come ready to eat and ready to drop some dough!",

The highlights for us were the warm frisee salad (blue cheese taste/smell wasn't overwhelming at all), the potato puree, the filet (meat was so so tender), and the cinnamon monkey cake. Honestly one of the best meals we've had in LV yet and our waiter Victor was so nice.   The only thing we would've done differently is order two rounds of the filet and passed on the NY Strip.",

You get what you pay for I suppose lol.  For sides and starters we did oysters, Caesar salad (mediocre), and arugula salad (pretty good).  For sides the mushrooms were the best. The corn grits were okay.  Besides the skirt steak, the free bread was also memorable.  For dessert we tried a bunch of different things. Can't really say anything was awesome.  The less than average part of the evening was the service! It was SO slow and I don't think the restaurant was that busy. We also asked the server to bring out one of the desserts w a candle so we could sing happy birthday and they totally forgot.  Doubtful I'll return here.

We also got two of each kind of oyster-- they come with 3 kinds of sauces.  Husband got the hangar steak, which was oversalted, but not enough for him to stop the meal to send it back. I had the filet mignon which was very tender. We also got fries to share.   The sides are a la carte and huge portions, so don't over order.

We had the Domestic Nagyu Chef's tasting.  Appetizer: - Shrimp Cocktail. Shrimp prepared perfectly and a cocktail sauce with perfect amount of bite.  Three small salads:  - Arugala Salad I am not a fan of Arugala salad, but theirs was excellent.  - Persian Cucumber and Watercress, was better than average.  - Itallian Buffalo Mozzarella with Hazelnuts, added a little twist that was very nice    Steaks: Ribeye and Filet for the cuts of meat. Both cooked to perfection and as very delicious.  Sides:  - Brissel Sprouts, in season so on everyones menu and they didn't dissapoint  - Au Gratin Potatoes, found out that my mother was undercooking the potatoes for my entire life. Both happy and sad at the same time, because I always loved my moms Au Gratin. Even if she were alive, I would have never told her this.  Deserts:  - Cinnamon Monkey Bread w/Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - Awesome  - Sorbets, Coconut Lime and Rasberry  - Chocolate Indulgence - Close second  - Farmers Market Fruit  The only let down to the entire meal was that they brought us four deserts when two would have sufficed... It is simply too much after that much provided in the prior courses.  The service was top nothc from start to finish. A must stop for anyone. I am glad we did the tasting because I would have missed out on some excellent items i would have otherwise not have tried.",

(I am not paying for a steak to eat at a bar)  We waiting over 20 minutes. The hostess seated other tables and then lied to us and said the computer system was down. After another 10 minutes, we left.   I'm not sure why she felt we were not worthy of a table.  What I do know is that I was completely disrespected and embarrassed at this restaurant. I will NEVER go back and will relay my experience to many others.",

    "text": "As an avid fan of Top Chef, I have watched Tom Colicchio on so many occasions shred a chef for failure to season food, especially not to use salt and pepper.  Imagine my surprise to find underseasoned food in every course at Craftsteak.  At $300 for dinner for two with one drink and one glass of wine, no dessert, I do expect better than this.    The starter of lobster salad was very good, just woefully underseasoned, lacking both salt and pepper and not tasting very much of the ginger alleged to be in the dressing.  My very expensive shrimp cocktail had a very faint taste of iodine which really surprised me.  Moving to the salad course, my partner's beet salad featured under-roasted and bland beets with no salt to speak of and a dressing so mild as to be nearly nonexistent.  My salad of persian cucumber was nearly undressed and the vinaigrette tasted barely of lemon juice and olive oil.  There was no savor to the dish at all.  Since everything is a la carte, here, $14 for unseasoned raw veggies is not the way to my heart.  I will say the short rib main was delicious.  My bone-in prime NY steak was a flavorsome cut of meat, but the absence of seasoning did not enhance the steak.  While the room was very nice and service good, underseasoned food in every course pretty much ruined the experience for me.  The side dishes were generous portions, but ran the gamut in quality.  Asparagus was bitter and a bit woody.  Grits were very nice if in need of a bit of salt.  The mushroom assortment was undercooked.  The Maui onions were the star side at our table.  Quite good.  Again, for what this place charges, they need better quality control.    I could not in good conscience recommend this place to friends, because at this level, the food ought to be well-seasoned and well-prepared, every course, every time.  I know \"celebrity\" chefs are too busy to actually cook in their eponymous venues, but they could at least hire executive chefs who would occasionally taste the offerings to find out what the line cooks are doing.  The wine list is quite extensive with some very nice offerings, but with such variable quality in the food, it would be frustrating to order a special vintage if the food was as uneven as we experienced.  In short, would not return here since there are too many truly wonderful places in Las Vegas.",

She joked with us, almost brought us a $560 bottle of wine on accident, and very helpful in answering all our menu questions.  I ordered the short rib & Japanese eggplant. Short rib was melt-off-the-bone great but there were some parts of it that were way too fatty. Eggplant was good, and a very large portion perfect for sharing. I tried a bit of my friend's spinach which actually seemed a little bland to me. Wines were good as well.   The only thing that was a little absurd - our cake cutting fee was $64. I don't know if that's the norm (maybe it is) but it really seems crazy to me. Also, the restaurant was COLD. By the end of the night, all of us were shivering (although we were in going out clothes, so that might have something to do with it..)  All in all a very pleasant dining experience and appropriately priced (minus the cutting fee).",

The kitchen failed us miserably.  I ordered the Wagyu steak and the cooked it to death, despite ordering it medium rare.  My wife ate her whole meal and I still did not receive my dinner.   I really didn't want it at that point and I never received it.  The manager comped our whole meal, which was unexpected, however that does not repay us for the 4 months we waited to eat here.  Tom needs to get off the TV and get back to this restaurant.  I really respected TC, but after this experience I may take a break from Top Chef episodes.  I really am losing faith in 'celebrity' chefs.  I would not gamble on this restaurant with your palate and wallet.  FAIL!",

We made reservation and got seated right away. We got lobster bisque and roasted beet salad to share. The server offered to bring out the soup in two separate bowls which I thought was very nice gesture since he knew we were sharing it. Both were delicious and the bread must have come right out from the oven cuz it was hot and tasty. We shared the 18oz ribeye steak and got brussel sprouts and potato gratin as sides. They cut the steak for us so it was easier to share. The portion was perfect for us and even had leftover. Steak was cooked to perfect medium rare and the flavor was just right. not too overbearing like some steakhouses.  Everything came out in timely manner and servers were great! I highly recommend it if ur making a trip to vegas and want to treat yourself to a nice steak dinner!",

(4-5 hours long around 5pm line up) My fiance and I decided to skip the buffet and make a reservation at Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak. What a great decision we made! Reservation was easy and the food was excellent! Because it was Thanksgiving they had a prix fixe thanksgiving dinner menu available with all your likings of turkey, stuffing, side dishes plus more. Although I love to have me some good turkey on turkey day, I already made up my decision to order myself a filet mignon. Good thing they didn't just served their prix fixe thanksgiving menu, the steak was phenomenal! So tender and perfectly executed! I loved it!  My fiance ordered the rib-eye and that was also very good. The steak had great marbling because the steak was tender and a bit of fat all around. It was good! But the filet mignon in my opinion was better.  The sides: we ordered potato puree and baby shiitake mushrooms. Both sides were delicious! Potato was creamy and certainly a good amount to share between 2 people. And last but not least, dessert! We had to go for their chocolate souffle with ice cream! Yummy! All in all, great service, great restaurant, great food, no wait!  Can't go wrong with a good steakhouse in Vegas!   Big fan of top chef, so glad I got to try tom's restaurant!",

Tons of male eye candy having a boys meal together. The guys next to our table were hilarious and entertaining. I had the bone in new York med rare. Sides were the corn and potato puree. Steak was delicious, perfectly seasoned with a slight crust at the edges. The potato puree were so creamy and silky.  The corn was a little savory, a little sweet and added some great texture to the whole meal. The buttered rolls they bring at the beginning are addicting but so self control is key. Great crowd and great service.  It turns out that many vegas restaurants recycle their food waste for farms, that was an interesting fact that our server gave us. They were able to fit us in with a last unite reservation at 930.  Remember to show your mlife card for points.",

I'm merely a novice foodie who studies the hospitality industry as it pertains to restaurants. From the moment you walk in, you're greeted graciously by the host as if you were one the aforementioned. The elite. If we had known the greatness of the quality of the cocktails, the wine, and of course the food, my peers and I would not thought twice of the slight 2-3 minute delay between being seated and the server introducing herself (Alexis by the way). Being knowledgable on all food and drink on the menu, she gave us what any appreciator of the art of restaurants could ask for; an amazing experience. From our initial drink order to last cup of French Press coffee and all the amazing food in between, service was by far second to none. The Mis en Place was on point to a T. Which we understand could not be possible without all the helping hands of the rest of the waitstaff; so on that note, thank you! In regards to food quality itself, you will not find a better cut of ribeye, NY strip, or filet in Vegas. Having selected the primary, the perfectly complimenting marbling of the ribeye was something to be noted for the ages that made this delectable, juicy, fine cut of meat one of a kind. Need I not forget to mention the Rosemary fingerling potatoes and the best au gratin potatoes I've ever had the opportunity to taste. As I see this is becoming lengthy, I'll leave on this last few notes. This restaurant is a must if you are ever in town. And while I'm certain service from everyone would be great, request the lovely and unforgettable Alexis. Thank you so much for an experience my friends and I shall never forget. It was the perfect military-going-away dinner I could ever enjoy. I'll definitely be back after boot camp.   Cheers,   Arram (Review writer)  Kyle (fellow diner)  Trevor (fellow diner)",

You started off with (dinnerf or two) two salads, three starters (shrimp cocktail, heirloom tomatoes, and bruscetta). Then we each got to hoose our meats. One wagyu sirloin and one wagyu ribeye. These steaks were superbly cooked. Very flavorful and melted in your mouth. The steaks came wth three sides. Bacon and cheese grits (to die for!!), asparagus, and potato gratin. Basically, we were full half way throught he steaks.   After all that, you also got three desserts. So being as full as we were, we took them to go. He Cinnamon Monkey bread was exellent. Paula Dean would've loved the butter flavor. It simply melted in your mouth. There was also a chocolate cake and a fruit tart. All were yummy.   Was a great food experience. Dropped $500 for two people, but how often do you get to eat this quality of food? Definitely reccommend if you have the time and the money. Great experience.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of steak as my reviews can attest to and so I'm happy to try them all out for you and report back!  This restaurant is by far one of the most beautifully laid out restaurants on the strip. The lighting, the wood accents and just the very low-key, mellow ambiance is just fantastic. I couldn't ask for a more beautiful place to dine.  Before I even get to the food I have to also say that the service here is incredible. You can always tell you're in an expensive restaurant. The wait staff just shines. It's no exception here. No empty glasses, excellent wine and drink selections and no waiting for requests. Being waited on hand and foot is exactly my style!  Onto the True beauty of this restaurant: the food. Yes, it's a steak restaurant, yes, there are many in Vegas, but none do food quite like Craftsteak. The originality combined with all of the other aspects of this place really elevate it to a different level.   The food choices are essentially the same for most steak houses. I had the bone-in ribeye and my associate had bison strip loin which I had never tasted. Mine was delicious. It was a nice size steak with just enough marbling to make it melt in the mouth without it venturing into that fatty, greasy taste. It had a nice seared crust that gave it a little crunch to go with the tenderness. Really a nice combo in the mouth. My associate's bison steak took me aback. I'm not a big fan of alternative meat, if you will. Bison just does not conjure up BBQ if you know what I mean. I see prairies and high grass, not a divine piece of meat on a platter. I'm happy to say I now see it both ways. Bison is extremely tender. I was expecting a gamey taste, the sort found on most wild animals (I know, bison are farm raised, but still - BISON?), but was happily surprised with the mild, tender meat that I encountered. I definitely think if you want to step out of your comfort zone you should try this cut of meat. Delicious.   As sides go they have an amazing assortment. My associate surprised me by ordering grits. I KNOW, RIGHT? I, being from Texas, know what a grit is. I will only eat it for my grandmother. UNTIL NOW. This was the best tasting grit I ever had! It was cooked so perfectly, so tenderly that I wanted to ask it why it didn't taste like this when I was a kid, but grits don't talk. Not even in Texas. So, these white corn grits were topped with bacon and Gruyere cheese and let me tell you if that's all you eat I will not tell anyone. They were an explosion of fabulous taste. I was shocked. I will never think of grits the same way again, I can assure you of THAT.  We also had the mushroom assortment and they were good, but they weren't done in a way that you'd ask for them again when you went back unless you're a mushroom nut. They were fine, I liked them, next.  No dessert here, but that will change next time I go. The assortment they had made my mouth water just reading them!  There is an incredible menu here. It's extensive, but don't take that to mean that they don't everything with flair. Nothing gets left behind here and that's surprising. You'll love it, though. Please bring me some grits when you go, okay? Don't tell my grandma.",

We ordered it Medium and it was flavorful and fantastic, even though we should have asked for it Med + or Med Well because it was just shy of med. They brought us an amuse bouche while we were waiting in between courses, which I thought that was pretty classy even though we weren't waiting very long at all. All in all very good",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I dined here on our recent trip to Las Vegas.   We had been debating on which steakhouse to dine at as there were so many to choose from.   We narrowed down our choices from (Delmonico, Mastros (we ate at the one in LA last year) and Craftsteak).  We eventually settled on Craftsteak mainly because it had the most reviews (vs Delmonico) & Mastros was in an odd setting (in a mall),   Do I think we made the right decision with Craftsteak?  ABSOLUTELY.   It was perfect from start to finish.  We were running a tad late for our reservation so I called in advance to let the hostess know and she graciously seated us as soon as we arrived.   The ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful. It didn't even feel like we were in a casino, which I worried about.  We both started with starters: I had the Cesar salad  & my boyfriend had the lobster bisque.   The Cesar salad was just okay for me. I feel the price was steep for a salad (about the same for lobster bisque)-- & the anchovies weren't very good.  The lobster bisque however was so good. Warm, decadent, and great presentation. The server brought out a bowl of chopped lobster and poured the soup over table side.   The rolls were also very good. They reminded me of Hawaiian rolls, freshly baked with sea salt. I wish they asked if we wanted more because we gobbled them down quite quickly.   For our main courses we ordered the rib eye and the scallops and the pureed potatoes.  We shared everything. It was all cooked perfectly. The steak was perfectly juicy throughout. And the scallops were so evenly salted and cooked. The pureed mashed potatoes melted in your mouth like butter.   The whole dinner was a complete experience. We wish we saved room for dessert. But even though we didn't, they brought out a lovely panna cotta with a candle for my boyfriend who was celebrating his birthday.   Such a nice touch to a wonderful meal and experience.   Would definitely dine here again! Definitely one of the highlights of our trips. :)",

I heard all good things and the menu looked really good. I knew that being on the strip it would be overpriced, so it is what it is. For $100 I expected a phenomenal steak. What I got was slightly overcooked (not really that bad, just a little). Also, it was just meh. My friend actually got a $150 or so steak and it was the same. If you are going to have really high end cuts of meat they should be exceptional. These were average at best. With so many other steak options on the strip I would recommend elsewhere. This wasn't the worst experience, and after writing this it could easily be 3 stars, but I'm sticking with 2 because of how disappointed I was due to my high expectations before going",

Everything about this restaurant was superb. I shared a 32 oz Porterhouse ($92) with 2 other people. We also got the Puree (mashed potatoes). This was more than enough for the 3 of us. We don't eat that much though, so don't think that with 32 oz will always feed 3 people. From these 2 items, the bill was $140 (after tip/tax). The steak was one of the best I've ever had. Its presentation was good and they even included the bone with the edible marrow inside it--legit.  Anyway, be ready to spend money here. While the food/service is exceptional, so are the prices.",

Maybe it was because i had unrealistically high expectations from all the top chef episodes, but it was a little disappointing. Not to say the food was good, it just didn't stand out from the other high tier restaurants.  For a party of 6, we ordered a prosciutto and salad as appetizer, both were huge portions, much bigger than i thought they would be. For entree we split a kobe skirt steak, a porterhouse for 2, ribeye, and a 2.5 lb lobster with sides of mushrooms and brussel sprouts. I have to say, the stand out items were  the skirt steak and brussel sprouts.   All the food plus 2 bottles of wine (1 was comped because we moved our table to help someone in a wheelchair) came out to be around $600ish.",

    "text": "This review pertains to the Restaurant Week Prix Fixe for $50.10.  The Skinny: solid steak house, good sides, pretty good desserts - however issues with serving sizes (4), service: great, warm and friendly (4), value: the prix fixe menus are the thing to get here... a la carte is very pricey and I wouldn't recommend it (3).  We used to hit Craftsteak when it was still just Craftsteak. The prix fixe menu was around $50-60 per person and pre-Top Chef fame. The reason why we loved it was the quality, the variety and the reasonable cost. Since then, they've steadily raised the prices to around $80/person which is way overpriced (plus they changed the beef to black angus... it used to be kobe.)  So we returned for Restaurant Week for it's more reasonable price point at $50.10/person. We had 5 people at our table and we were quite pleased by the spread.  Service was quite prompt, warm and efficient. Our server was pleased that we had come in for the Restaurant week event and was eager to help us use our vouchers for free drinks. The manager did stop by to greet us and ensure we were having a good time.  We were served the grilled quail, shaved fennel salad, persian cucumber/watercress salad, mozzarella salad for appetizers. This was followed by prime flat iron steak, grilled angus skirtsteak, sweet corn, yukon potatoes, scallops with the lemon vinaigrette and a dish of baby shitake mushrooms. (for more details, please see the above pics).  The grilled quail was tender, perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious. As were all three of the starter salads. We actually received two dishes of the mozzarella salad although we would have preferred more of the fennel salad. Along with the piping hot butter pan rolls, all the flavours of the food worked together beautifully.  The two beef dishes were well-executed and I loved the springs of fresh thyme. The scallops had a wonderful caramelization on both sides.The corn was fabulous as always and we were given two dishes of this.   Although I really like the flavours of their Yukon Gold potatoe puree, I do like my potatoes to be a little less soft (albeit it's a puree... right? but still a little texture would be better). The shitake mushrooms were a very small serving size considering that this dish was to be shared amongst 5 of us. Same goes for the potato puree.  We had two rather large servings of skirtsteak and flat iron prime with relatively smaller portions of sides. I think I would have like more sides rather than so much beef.  Dessert consisted of five separate dishes: a peach pavlova, a chocolate panna cotta, a molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, monkey bread with banana ice cream and a traditional cheesecake.  Of the 5 desserts, the monkey bread and the molten chocolate cake were my favourite. The warm monkey bread had a rich cinnamon, nut topping and was perfectly paired with banana gelato. The molten chocolate cake was moist on the outside, runny on the inside - just the way it's supposed to be.  The chocolate panna cotta was a little too firm texturally. While I did like the peach sorbet on top of the pavlova, the pavlova itself was a little too thick and thus felt very hard overall. The cheesecake was good but nothing special.  In essence, this is simple food is done right. The only problems were the proportions of the side dishes and some issues with the desserts. This results in a 4 star review.  I have to say, for $50, it's a good deal but certainly not $80ish as it normally is. Because we did the Wet Republic event, we got 30.10/person voucher plus a coupon for a free drink each. So overall, we paid $30ish per person (including tax and tip). It was great seeing our bill at the end.",

He was honest about the portion sizes and suggested great appetizer pairings.   For 5 people we shared 2 sampler menus for the grade 7 wagyu (50/50 mix between  wagyu and angus) plus an extra side and it was the perfect amount...satisfied and borderline too bloaty to go out afterward haha  The dinner rolls were good with a sprinkle of sea salt on top. The butter was really interesting it kind of tasted like cheese...rich and delicious.  Appetizers: Prawns Frise bacon and blue cheese salad: man breaking the slighty fried egg and mixing it through the salad = heaven  Prosciutto ham + fig compote = the pairing was delicious  Caesar salad  Zee meat: So I ate wagyu for the first time in Taiwan and I remember it being melt on your mouth omg I want to faint delicious. However, I think since our meat that night was a higher ratio of angus, it didn't give the same effect for the ribeye BUT the flank steak was surprisingly so tender and perfect (and the waiter said it was a better cut for people who don't like their meat cooked rare)  Dessert: Sorbet Lava cake Cheesecake  Meh all okay, I did have major food envy for the table next to us' monkey bread.    Still dreaming about the australian grade 10 wagyu...one day.",

We were planning to get the tasting menu before we got to Vegas, but my friend and her bf went the day before us and didnt like it at all. So we went for the straight menu, our server Wallace (i think thats his name) was great. Also he introduced us to this Malbec that went so well with our meaty dinner!  We started off with the Wagu Steak Tartare, my first time trying meat tartare. WOW it was soooo good, and they give you a generous amount! My gf got the Surf and Turf, filet mignon and diver sea scallops. OMG she fell in love with the scallops. I got the rib eye that was cooked perfectly, with a side of asparagus that was nicely seasoned. I was so stuffed that I took half my meat back to the hotel. They also give you these personal sized A1 sauce. They gave us these little treats for our Anniversary + our sorbet desserts. Made us happy campers!  What an awesome dinner! Me and my gf have been 2 for 2 now on anniversary dinners in Vegas. I think the only reason I didnt give this place a 5 star is that they had served some people who literally looked like they came out of the pool area with their board shorts and drinks in hand. That kind of makes the place seems a bit tacky.   I was pleased at the food though, atleast I can say I ate at a top chef judge's restaurant. Tom gets a thumbs up!",

    "text": "After having heard Tom Colicchio pontificate week after week on Top Chef about his approach and expectations of food, we went to his Craftsteak restaurant, located in the MGM Grand Hotel, with something of a chip on our collective shoulders. Would his restaurant live up to the hype and high standards he espouses on Top Chef? After having enjoyed a dinner at Craftsteak, I can honestly and emphatically say, YES! And then some. This is how a Top Chef restaurant should be run. The food is exceptional, the restaurant decor is soothing and low-keyed, and the service is world-class without being stuffy or formal.   We decided to splurge and order the 3-course Wagyu Beef Tasting. If you are an adventurous diner, I highly recommend putting your taste buds in the hands of the chef. I suggest it for those die-hard foodies like me who enjoy the variety and surprise of a tasting menu selected by the chef. The Wagyu beef choice did not disappoint. It was in fact, Foodie Heaven. Yes, it was on the expensive side but well worth the cost. Every dish was well prepared and seasoned to perfection. The beef was tender and flavorful and there was plenty of it. I especially enjoyed the Wagyu Tartare served with small rounds of toast. And not to be outdone, Chef Colicchio has a genius for a pastry chef at this location. Of the four different desserts we enjoyed, the mascarpone cheese cake bordered on sinful, not to mention the velvety-rich chocolate sorbet.  If you're in Las Vegas and want the very best dining experience that this city has to offer go to Craftsteak. You won't be disappointed.",

I dont ever remember skirt steak as an offering but this time my skirt steak could barely be cut with a steak knife. Appetizers were all tasteless. Service mediocre. Dessert and cocktail were excellent though. Definitely not worth the $430 for just me and my wife. Time to start trying some of the new steak restaurants in LV.",

Exactly the type of place you want to go while in Las Vegas.  My date and I had a large booth all to ourselves.    Best of all, the staff is extremely knowledgeable about gluten and celiac disease. Our waiter went through the menu and pointed out the (very few) items that I could not have. The waiter informed us that the restaurant had pretty much done away using wheat flour to because of the frequency of diners with celiac and wheat allergies.  The chef and cooking staff are schooled on cross-contamination, too. Also, they have an excellent wine list and I had a champagne cocktail in place of dessert that was like heaven in a glass.",

What can I say, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...okay, I drank way too much and thought a steak and bread would cure my stomach, but just the thought of eating made me sick. lol it's okay though, my boyfriend had no problems helping me enjoy this meal the next day lol. The staff was friendly and very funny. They helped entertain me while I was waiting to take my order back to my room. The guys were friendly and all smiles. Wish I could remember their names.

    "text": "Eventhough so many people gave this place good ratings... I would say that the complementary bread deserves the big HYPE for this restaurant.  I went with a party of 6, which we all had very high expectations. The first let down was the atmosphere. The tables and chairs did not seem sturdy, I'm sorry call me picky, but I feel like if a restaurant is going to charge me $50 for a rib eye steak then I need the tables dressed with white lining and the servers with white gloves on.   The bread made up for the Ikea furniture, as soon as the bread hits your mouth theres a buttery sweetness with a hint of salty, melts in your mouth and warm comfort goodness.  I ordered the rib-eye with gratin potatoes with warm salad with bacon and egg. The salad was very good, unusual but delightful. The steak could have used alot more flavor and the potatoes was just okay (I've had BETTER). The only other thing that stood out was the short ribs and the broccoli. There was another dish which I can't remember the name, but it was a rosotto like dish with brown rice, butternut squash, mushrooms and other components that I can not recollect.   Lastly, which may seem very trivial to everyone else but my party seem to take offense to it as well. One of our friends needed his food togo so the server took his plate to bag it up. To come back with a \"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU\" bag (YES THE SAME BAG) any chinese fast food restaurant would give you for togo order. Then to add insult to injury the server sits his plastic bag which has his food in it ON THE FLOOR!!! We all had this \"WTF\" look on our face.  This would be my last time coming here, I rather go to Ruth's Chris any day.",

    "text": "Wow, Craftsteak deserves the full 5 stars. We had a 5:30 p.m. reservation as we were seeing a 7 p.m. show. They immediately seated us, no wait! The interior of the restaurant is simply elegant. The entire wait staff was efficient, friendly, helpful without being intrusive. The recommendations were spot on and honest. As soon as our waiter came over to take our drink order, he acknowledged our show time and assured us they would have us out in plenty of time, and they did.  So here goes the food...... Start with rolls, fresh, hot out of the oven melt in your mouth fabulous.  Starters: Mr. B started with the Lobster Bisque, it was cream based, delicious, full of tender chunks of lobster. I started with the Buffalo Mozzarella with pistachio's, amazing. The Buffalo Mozzarella was creamy topped with finely chopped tomatoes and pistachio's which added a nice crunch. Drizzled with a Balsamic Vinegar and a tad bit of olive oil.  Main Course/Side Dishes Mr. B then opted for the 6 oz. Filet and Fresh Australian Crab. The steak was perfectly cooked, the Crab well after Deadliest Catch we all have more appreciation for Crab, and it didn't disappoint, Yum!! The Younger B, chose the Bison Flatiron and I can't even begin to tell you how incredible the Bison was, both of them shared a bit with me. The side dish he ordered was the butternut squash risotto served with Hen of the Woods, which is a mix of unusual mushrooms. It didn't last long, gone in less than 60 seconds. Now for me, yes I know I can't top the other two, but I went the light route and ordered the side dish of Fall Squash Agnolotti, topped with mushrooms. It was very good and I enjoyed each and every bite.  The wine was delicious, and we all agreed it is by far one of the best meals we have enjoyed in a very long time. My compliments to the Chef and thank you to Tom Collichio for setting the bar so high, you have created a fabulous restaurant.  I will tell you, it is quite pricey, so know this before going. The wines by the glass are all over $12 per glass, the steaks are all over $35 and the side dishes are ala carte and priced anywhere between $12 and $15. All I can say is it was very well worth it and I can't wait to go back.",

In fairness to the restaurant, one of our party was not feeling well, which coloured the experience. However, we did signal the server that we didn't want to order too much food so as not to aggravate the situation. Instead of advising us that the portions are large, the server kept trying to upsell us on more dishes. Since the sides being suggested were $24, it came across as an attempt to pad the bill. A simple word of warning would have prevented us from ordering dishes that left our table 3/4 full. What we had was fine, but not spectacular. I ordered the seafood sampler for two ($56), which was fine. One of our party ordered a ribeye that was delicious. The deconstructed caesar salad was average, as were the fingerling potatoes. The Brentwood corn was quite good.   Servers, please take note: your job is to provide customers with a positive experience. If you do, no complaint will be made over the cost of the bill, and your efforts will be reflected in the tip. If you don't, all that your guests will remember is how you allowed your greed to overshadow their fun.",

    "text": "Since we were staying at MGM, we decided to try Tom Colicchio's CraftSteak for Valentine's Day.  Let me first say that the place was very nice and the service excellent.  We had two waiters...still not sure why, but a nice touch.  We started with a Caesar Salad which was average, but loaded with anchovies...some of us don't like anchovies, but the waiter did not ask when we ordered.  The sides were Brussel Sprouts and Fries, neither of which were more than average.  Now we get to the steaks.  We ordered one Filet, one NY Strip and one Rib-eye.  I ordered the NY Strip medium rare plus since the waiter said that medium was warm pink middle.  The steak I received was RARE.  I asked for it to be returned and cooked to medium and after a 10 minute wait (the others in the party felt uncomfortable waiting for my food to return) the steak was still rare.  I had to eat around the edges to avoid the raw middle.  In addition, the cut of meat had a vein of grizzle running through it.  The other two in my party said their meat was average...similar to what you would get at Outback Steakhouse.  Oh, the peppercorn sauce was below average as well.  The dinner rolls were excellent...wouldn't want to forget to mention that.  Considering everything was a la carte and the steaks were over $50 each, we got out of there at $300 for three with no appetizers or dessert.  Ouch!",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for a bachelorette party and we decided to do a nice dinner here before heading out on the town.  loved the ambiance and the staff were so incredibly nice. our table of six girls made up about 90% of the female clientele in the restaurant since many of the other tables looked like they were full of business men and guys out for their bachelor party. since we were planning on a long night out we didn't want to cut it short by eating ourselves into a food stupor. the staff were so nice and accommodating about us sharing our food since they said they usually serve family style.  Here's the food breakdown:  Oysters on the half shell: fresh, crisp, tasted like they were straight from the ocean.  No complaints there.  Frisee Salad: Basic salad. good nothing amazing, but I enjoyed it.   Porterhouse (shared 3 ways): Meat was definitely high quality and delicious! I like my meat cooked rare, but since I was sharing with 2 other people we went medium rare so the meat was a bit more done than I care for.  The meat was still flavorful and super juicy. We actually didn't even finish the porterhouse even among 3 girls with very healthy appetites!  Sides: We ordered asparagus, yukon gold puree, and hen of the woods mushrooms.  At a steakhouse I'm really all about the meat so quality of the sides are important, but not my main focus. I enjoyed the asparagus and the yukon gold puree.  I usually enjoy any and all foods, but I have to admit the hen of the woods mushrooms were new to me and definitely had a taste that I found peculiar and just didn't work for me, but everyone else seemed to enjoy them.   Dessert:  Table of 7 girls shared a chocolate souffle. IT WAS AMAZING.  Enough said... I'm not that big on chocolate but that souffle made me feel some feelings. ;)    Overall, food was consistently good and the offerings were fairly basic steakhouse fare. Staff was wonderfully attentive and nice. I would have appreciated a better $50-$75/bottle selection of wines.  I know it's a finer dining experience, but after dropping all that money on food a decent affordable bottle of wine would have made it that much better. :)",

From potatoes Au gratin, risotto, asparagus, and potato puree, everything was delicious. The waiter encouraged us to try their most popular, skirt steak. A-MAZ-ING!!! Wow. And very nice portions! We should have shared! I had the filet mignon. Very tasty but was wanting some more of the skirt steak! And if that wasn't enough, to top it all off, we all shared the monkey bread...Our friend had mentioned food coma before the meal. Now I know what he was talking about!

I am not a steak snob, but I know the difference between good and great and this one hit the spot!  Delicious!!! In a city of thousands of quality dining experiences, I would recommend Craftsteak in a heartbeat!",

    "text": "Incredible, excellent dinner while on vacation.  Perhaps the finest steak in memory.  Cooked to perfection. Also had the beets salad and charcuterie platter as shared appetizers. Superb!  Shared sides of potatoes, asparagus, and carrots.  Well 2/3 were great. Carrots were surprisingly tasteless.  Mostly tasted the char.  Service was flawless.  Very helpful in suggesting items and preparation (companion got the hangar steak and he suggested going with medium since its thinner-very helpful).  Nice, classy setting except tables were a bit too close. We were on the long couch near the back and tables so close you could very easily hear the next several tables.  Overall, these 2 problems (carrots and seating) are so minor I'll keep them at 5 stars.  Highly recommend.  A bit of a spurge but worth it.",

No one checked on us. our steaks came and waiter finally came over to get a second drink offer. For a guy that preaches service so much, and for these prices - i expect great service. I'm from Chicago so I expect high prices and the wine list is jacked up so high - and if you are going to charge that - service should be so much better. So disappointed - apparently doesn't care that much",

They gave us so much food, we didn't even eat it all.  For the first course, we got like 3 plates of unique salads and soups, 2nd course like like 3 types of very good steaks, and 3rd course was like 3-4 plates of dessert.  We were full by the 1st course, and force feed our selfs on the 2nd course, and we picked at our dessert.  I will go back again.  I got to Vegas a lot, so hopefully the manager sends us an invite for some specials...wink-wink, hint-hint!!!",

We brought our own wine but some of our party ordered cocktails - the French martini was delicious.   The table bread was served warm with the perfect sprinkling of salt and the butter was soft (important details here...nothing worse than hard butter with bread).  I ordered the $79 wagyu skirt steak which is a splurge but it was highly recommended so I had to check it out. It was delicious and could have easily fed 3 people. Good to know for next time! We got a variety of sides to share including the shishito peppers, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, spinach and butternut squash. The lobster salad was fresh - perfect squeeze of lemon.  The shishito peppers were not my fave, there was something missing so I ended up salting them. The shrimp cocktail came with 5 pieces of plump shrimp for $23. The cucumber salad was tasty. We ordered a side of fries for the kids, I think I ended up eating at least half of the bowl. Ha. They were cooked perfectly with the right amount of crunch and seasoning.  Dessert was amazing. Apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream was delicious as was the souffle with caramel ice cream. I didn't try the monkey bread served with banana ice cream because someone was holding it hostage at the other end of the table.  As you can see, we ordered a good portion of the menu so I can easily say you should try Craftsteak for a special occasion. It ain't cheap but good eats.",

They start you off with Hawaiian rolls served with clarified butter, you could make the trip here just for those. For entree I went with the domestic ribeye which was cooked to perfection. It melted in my mouth, so delectable and juicy. My boyfriend had the domestic Waygu NY strip and you could certainly taste the difference of the beef, unbelievably savory and delicious. For our side dish we went with the spring pea risotto...  risotto is a difficult beast to conquer - and craftsteak totally nailed it. If you are staying at the MGM Grand there should be no doubt in your decision making but to eat here. Worth every penny and would come back in a heart beat. I understand now why Tom Colicchio is such a great judge on Top Chef. Mad respect!!",

Completely burnt on the outside and raw on the inside.  If steak is going to be bloody you better make sure that the sinew is cut out.  Don't know about you, but i don't appreciate chewing on sinew on raw meet.  They also needed more seasoning for such a big cut of meat, but there was none on the table.  Our tables ordered the chicken as well.  Other than me i don't think anyone else tried it.  i'm a sucker and have to try everything.  The chicken was dry and without any real taste.  The rest of the appetizer, side dishes, and desert were excellent...not enough to make up for the main entree.  This is my second time at Craftsteak.  I was disappointed last time as well.  Would not try it a third time.  Ended up going to another steakhouse on the same trip as i didn't feel that i had my fill of steak.",

We had a vegan friend who was able to get a plate specific to her needs which was awesome. The food was exceptional ... if you are a steak connoisseur .... you will not be disappointed! There was a large selection of wines and cocktails ...the ones we purchased were overall delicious. I gave it a 4/5 not because of the food ... but due to small things that could have been smoother. The wait time at the beginning being one, a few errors on 3 orders and the split check fiasco. At the end of service they brought out homemade cookies for the bride as a congratulatory gift which was super kind... and the host was nice enough to take a group pic for us.

Our booth felt private and overlooked the rest of the tables.   The service was somewhat spotty. The hostess was pleasant, our main waiter was nice but seemed to have disappeared toward the end of dinner. The guys who brought our the food were very nice and attentive.  Appetizers: 1) sea scallops- came with 3 large scallops which were perfectly cooked; however the taste was lacking. It had a very light lemony butter taste but it just didn't stand out. I would not order this again.  2) wagyu tartare- this was one of my favorites. Delicious and flavored just right. Came with plenty of crostini to spread that delicious meat on. If you like tartare- try it!  3) rib eye steak- very big disappointment!! It was more than $50 and came lukewarm. Seasoned and cooked well but the temperature really killed it. It was also way too fatty and we had to cut large chunks of fat out to eat it. I love my fat but it was just too much.  4) braised short ribs- this was very flavorful and tender. I wish it came with some sort of starch to balance it out. Eating this by itself was a bit too salty and it was difficult to eat a lot of it.  5) risotto side dish- I really liked this one with red corn, prosciutto and cilantro. Great flavors and risotto cooked just right!  6) monkey bread for dessert- got this because of all the fantastic reviews. It cane warm and soft but way too sweet for my taste :(  Overall it was an extremely pricey meal for subpar food. I'm disappointed Tom!",

I've been wanting to try this place for a while because we do love our steaks :) Our favorite place for steaks is Mastro in Beverly Hills. We've also had really great experience at CUT in Vegas. So this time we want to try something different and we chose craftsteak because of the reviews on yelp. We made same day reservation and we were seated immediately after we arrived.   The server was just alright, he explained the menu very quickly that we both were kinda lost on how the three course menu work. I felt like he shouldn't be in a hurry in explaining the menu, especially because we told him that it was our first time dining there. We have to ended up calling him back to explain it again. Thoroughly.  We got the domestic wagyu three course meal, and we wanted to get ribeye for both of us but he said that you can't have the same cut of steak in a table, which is weird. So we settled with New York and ribeye cuts. We are allowed to choose 2 salads and 3 sides. We got a wagyu beef tartar and a shrimp cocktail. The tartar was quite amazing (that was my first time eating it), the shrimps in the cocktail was huge and plump, the mozzarella salad was quite yummy and the pork belly salad was just ok (nothing special).   When the steaks arrived I realized that my ribeye was missing the fatty ring around it, which usually makes the steak much more juicier. I was a little sad, but my fiance's New York steak looks amazing! So I just let it go and moved on to try the sides. The Chanterelles mushroom was delish, the potato gratin was creamy and yummy, but the risotto was too cheesy and looked almost like Mac and cheese. We finished everything except the risotto, which was disappointing.   We were stuffed at this point and we almost forgot about the desserts. The desserts were chef's choice, so we didn't know what we were getting. The brought out 4 plates of dessert! Wow. We got the monkey bread with caramel and vanilla ice cream, the chocolate peanut butter mousses with chocolate ice cream, white chocolate ice cream and spicy (fruit) sorbet and a plate of mixed fresh fruits. We really liked the monkey bread and the mousse, but the spicy sorbet was bland.   Overall it was a nice experience to have and we would probably come back once we've tried every other steakhouse there is in Vegas. The ambiance was nice, the service could be better but it was prompt, and the food was really good for the most part. If you feel like trying this place, I'd recommend getting the three course meal for sure. You are going to be getting full size of everything and you will definitely be stuffed at the end. We spent a little bit over $300 before tips, but it was worth every penny because we got a lot of different things.",

I don't think anything was bad, but after paying $300, I don't think anything was particularly good either.   First, it's a little weird that there were people dressed in t-shirts and shorts there for dinner; I guess that's not Craftsteak's fault because it's Vegas and everyone does as they please.   The wine bottles are especially marked up, which really annoys me. I know that's how they make money and they have to build Tom's fortune and pay for his dome wax, but it really puts me off.   The food was mediocre. The filet that I asked for medium was medium well in parts and medium rare in the rest. Plus, it needed a lot more seasoning! What does Tom say? Simple salt and pepper! The brussel sprouts and potato gratin were slightly better seasoned but still needed a lot more flavor to be memorable. The of the desserts, the sorbets were very good, but the carrot cake was a bummer.   Take my advice and go to Mesa Grill instead!",

    "text": "I was in town for a \"boys weekend\" and suggested rather than blowing our money on gambling, we spend it on a good meal. I had not been here before, but I'm a foodie and know of Tom Colicchio. Our party of 4 came on a Sunday night and all I can say was our meal here was epic.   We ended up getting the Chef's Beef Selection of the Domestic Wagyu ($155 per person for two people) and Domestic Wagyu Surf &Turf ($185 per person for two people).  First course consisted of: Shrimp Cocktail, Sea Scallops, Wagyu Tartare, Wild Arugula and Warm Frisee. Wild Arugula was nothing special, but everything else was very good. The Warm Frisee was so flavorful and definitely our favorite.   Second course consisted of (Sides): Mushroom Assortment, Asparagus, Potato Puree, and Corn. Again, all were delicious, but standouts were the Potato Puree which was buttery and made you go back for seconds & thirds. Mushroom Assortment was yummy and nice to be able to compare the differences between each.  (Entree): Lobster, Ribeye, NY Strip, Filet Mignon and Skirt Steak. Lobster was fresh and cooked to perfection. Each meat was tastier than the previous one, but my favorite was the skirt steak that melted in your mouth and was to die for.  Final dessert courses consisted of: Assorted Sorbet, Chocolate Souffle, Bread Pudding, Monkey Bread, Chocolate Mousse and Farmers Market Fruit. All were delectable, but the Bread Pudding and Monkey Bread were top notch.  Service and staff were on point and our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and attentive. We appreciated the table touch by the manager as well.  You really can't go wrong with any choices here. There was so much food that we actually couldn't finish all the meats and desserts. It's not cheap and you'll spend a pretty penny (our bill came to about $250/person after a drink, tax & tip), but life is too short to always eat at buffet in Vegas.   If ordering any of the Chef's Beef Selection - bring your appetite and be prepared to be in a food coma after. I'll definitely be back...",

The dry aged NY strip was perfect and the braised short ribs were the most tender I've ever eaten. The Lobster Bisque deserves 5 stars as well. The side dishes however were all lacking flavor and seasoning.  The potato puree was nearly inedible and did not add anything to the dish.  The risotto could have been mistaken for the cheese grits I had at MGM buffet earlier for Brunch.  The most disappointing part of the experience was the service. Our waiter was knowledgable and helpful in  choosing our menu, but after we ordered we didn't see him again.  No one one the wait staff came to our table between getting our food and delivering the check.   We talked to management about the lack of flavor in the side dishes and they removed them from the bill reconciling the experience enough to keep us pleased and wanting to give Craft Steak another try next time we come to Las Vegas.  When I see a renowned name like Tom Collichio I expect perfection.  This meal was not that but we were happy overall.",

All of the appetizers were great and we loved the sides (especially the corn). The only drawback was the baby squash which was fairly tasteless. We received steaks: New York, Filet Mignon, Hangar, Ribeye. They were cooked perfectly and brought to the table sliced up. Oh and can't forget the Parker Rolls, melt in your mouth delicious. Then the desserts came - chocolate mousse, pannacotta, ice cream and sorbet, monkey bread and a peach upside down cake - wow and worth it! All of this was paired with a Flowers Pinot Noir.

Big mistake...we probably would have had the same meal at their steakhouse, for 1/2 the price.  Everything we ordered was bland and overpriced.  Wine list was extremely stuffy and the prices were outrageous.  We weren't on someone else's expense account so we chose to share items; Caesar salad-tasteless--very little parm and dressing was flavorless.  Not offered freshly ground pepper and one of our many waiters just dropped the salad and left.  Clams--these were pretty good, but again---they didn't do anything but shuck them, accompaniments were also basic.  18oz bone in ribeye--No crust and meat was very average at best.  Diver Scallops--these were OK.  They were a little under-cooked.  Monkey Bread was the best part of the meal, which was quickly brought way down by the peanut butter girl scout cookies they brought out for our anniversary.  Are you kidding me?  No comp on the Monkey Bread dessert, no \"Happy Anniversary\" as we were being seated.  No \"Welcome Mr. & Mrs....\" No welcoming attitude and appreciation for the business we were giving them or any recognition of our special day.  There are many better options out there if you want to spend $300+ for 2 people. As frequent Vegas visitors (4-5x year) this will not be on our list of \"go-to's\".",

I came to Craftsteak with 3 other young people last night for dinner following an event and I can confidently assume that the service was due to age discrimination.   Our orders were taken and we were never visited again by the waiter until he approached our table over an hour later with \"did you get dessert menus yet?\" There was a very kind bus-lady taking care of our table to clean plates and silverware, but for $100 a sitting, I expect the waiter to come check on the table intermittently and have an ounce of personality. Food was fine, but I've certainly had much better at a steakhouse.    If you aren't fond of your job, the door is behind you. And if you think that young people don't tip or notice bad service, you're sorely mistaken. I will never return to Craftsteak and I will make sure that my colleagues and cohorts know, too.",

    "text": "What a wonderful meal and experience. After having to change our reservation 3 times due to messed up flights and conflicting engagements we finally made it in to the restaurant. We were seated at our table and promptly greeted by one of our 3 servers. She talked us through the menu and made her recommendations and left us to talk for a little while. We were then greeted by our busser who throughout the evening didn't let our water glasses fall below the halfway mark. Everyone was so pleasant and engaging.  Then came the food. They brought us those unbelievably, perfectly salty and savory dinner rolls with creamy butter to start. We ordered some oysters and the warm frisee salad and they came out perfectly. The salad was full flavored and delicious. We split 2 steaks and 3 sides and wow, the flavor profiles went through the roof! The steaks were cooked to perfection and were so tender and buttery that you could almost cut them with a fork. You must get the masked potatoes too. They were as creamy, sweet, and buttery as you could ever want them to be.  As we sat there talking about how full we were the server brought over the dessert menu. My brothers girlfriend commented that it would almost be foolish not to at least split 1. Naturally we order the toffee monkey bread and as they brought it out I realized that they were surprising me for my birthday, which is next week. All of the servers were in on the surprise and they all came over individually to say something. So kind and generous throughout the whole meal and they made it a perfectly special evening.   We will be returning here the next time we visit Vegas and we make a point to never go to the same place twice since there are so many wonderful places to try.   Do yourself a favor and go have the best dinner experience you'll have while you're in town.",

    "text": "This is one of the best steak restaurant at Vegas.   The host lady placed us at the bar area. The tables were tiny and the seatingis low. The bar area were very loud and noisy.  We requested to sit in the main dining room, but they answer us that the main dining room were fully booked. After we requested a few times, they finally agreed to placed us in the main dining room. Where there were only a few tables around(even after we dinned).   Tip 1: Mention on the phone that you want to placed in main dining room, otherwise they will place you at the bar area.   The service at bar area = 2 star The service at main dining room = 5 star  +++Kobe tartare is an excellent dish. Tartare were lean and fresh. It goes perfectly with quail egg and the sauce. It's a amazingly tasty appetizer.  +++Seared Kobe skirt melts in your mouth. The meat  is beautifully marbled, the meat is nicely seared, it's tender and juicy.. This dish is a bit overly seasoned, but the quality and the tenderness of the meat covered it's mistake.   -++ Lobster bisque is one of the best lobster bisque so far. It's tasty and creamy. It's nice to share the soup, because it's still a chunky soup.  --+ Diver scallop goes perfectly with fennel and the sauce, however the scallops were too raw. The texture was a bit jello.   ++Apple caramel ice cream tasted amazingly good. However there were no apple flavor nor apple taste in this ice cream. The ice cream were creamy and not overly sweetened.  --+Buttermilk cranberry sorbet was meh to compare with apple caramel ice cream. It was sweet and sour.   We highly recommend this wonderful tasty steakhouse to all our friends.",

After requesting vegetarian options last night, we were originally told we could get the risotto or grits.  Tonight they said the chef wouldn't accomodate  those since pre-made with chicken stock.  They recommended the veggie platter instead.  Potatoes were no fully cooked and other veggies were very hit and miss and piled up.  Was about volume rather than quality.  Despite the volume, because some were undercooked and others not interesting, hardly a satisfying meal.  We had less than a quarter of each (each of the 2 was $32).  No questions about why it was mostly unfinished.  Very disappointing.",

I didn't have high expectations because I haven't been to many steakhouses on the strip and I'm used to typical Ruth Chris or wolf gang type places.  I must say this is probably the best steak I've ever had.  I had the wagyu rib eye with snap pea risotto, potatos, mushrooms for my side.  Steak was cooked and seasoned to my liking and the risotto is so delicious.  We order the shrimp cocktail appetizer which was good but nothing special than any other restaurant.  The monkey bread dessert is to die for.  Heaven in your mouth...  I will say the one down side is the price... def the most expensive steak dinner of my life.  But worth it.  We ordered 2 bottles of wine so my portion of the bill came out to $200.",

    "text": "I died and entered the gates of steakhouse heaven!!  I did some scouting on YELP and decided on this venue; it's as if the culinary gods were in my favor, stars aligned and all.  The joint was dim and pretty packed, patrons enjoying meals at tables and guzzling down drinks at the bar - servers were bustling around taking care of everyone.  The BF and I sat at the bar while we waited for our table. Nice vibe, I totally dig it. You can forget the snotty staff here, everyone was really nice and approachable.  When we sat for dinner, a lovely gentleman whose name I cannot recall, went over the menu and made excellent recommendations. He was a pleasant man and provided top-notch service, a real professional I tell you.  I more than enjoyed the Maine lobster bisque, I only shared one spoonful with the BF and he instantaneously got struck with food envy - so much so he had to order a bowl for himself.  Roasted Baby Beets Beet Pickled Egg was also ordered. While good, it's safe to say you can skip out on ordering this so you can leave room for the other items that were much better.  We also tried the Hand-cut Wagyu Tartare Crostini. Sounds fancy, right? It didn't leave much of an impression for me so wouldn't order it again. The oysters & scallops are on my radar for my next visit though!  Onto the entree, ding! ding! ding! Champ of the night!  While I am a rib-eye kinda gal, we decided on the Kobe Wagyu beef skirt steak. Holy fuck Batman!! If my taste buds had little mouths to speak they would be singing and rejoicing like a black womens' choir on a Sunday morning, praising God, and squeezing out little tears of joys if my little guys had eyes. Yes, it WAS that good and by far THEE BEST STEAK I EVER HAD. I'm telling you, this steak is L.E.G.I.T. We ordered it medium rare and I don't know how they did it (maybe magic) but the outside had a nice crisp char to it while the meat inside was PERFECTLY tender and my god juicy!! I daydream about this steak, definitely an item I would request for a last meal.  We equally enjoyed the sides as well:  Mushroom assortment on top of risotto - definitely a must if you are into mushrooms and like savory foods!  Yukon Gold Puree - so good, I think my eyes rolled back for a good 2 seconds! I literally envisioned myself swimming in a pool of this stuff and darn, having to eat my way out. Don't worry, in my mind's eye I didn't need any rescuing.  Least to say, dessert was a blur. I was so impressed with everything else I cannot remember how dessert was. Also, it was so busy that we were left waiting a good 20 minutes before it arrived. Our server felt so bad he literally brought out 4 desserts - overboard but definitely appreciated the gesture.  I left with a food baby for the night and had to take a nap in the room for an hour before going out again.  I'm in love with this place and crave it every so often. Whenever I'm in Vegas, I will make it a point to come dine here again and spoil the fat kid in me.",

It was so dark I had to ask for a flashlight to illuminate the menu.  They didn't have one, we finally used the light from one of the phones.  I detest eating in low lights when you can't see what's on your plate. I asked the server and the Manager several times to please turn down the music as we couldn't even hear the person on the other end of the table talk.  Dinner with old friends should be an enjoyable experience, especially catching up, but it was impossible.  I wouldn't go there again if you paid me to, a waste of an evening.",

Most of the food was reasonably good steakhouse fare, tho not necessarily a great value.  My \"dry aged NY strip\" was way overcooked... and tasted suspiciously not dry aged.  Seriously... I've grilled better steaks for half as much.  Or gotten better steak from LaFrieda for a few bucks more.    My experience at the bar has been better than the dining room..... so sit at the bar.   They have some great whiskys and the bar staff has been super quick/attentive.  I would prob try a diff steakhouse next trip, or sit at the bar.  Also- Colicchio's Mgr's failed to respond to a direct email regarding this problem. Super not responsive.",

    "text": "I had the 3 course meal here with 4 of my friends this weekend. What a pleasurable dining experience! I loved the decor of the steakhouse. As we walked through MGM, I was a little concerned we'd be facing the busy shopping area, but we ended up completely tucked away in the back of the restaurant.  We all opted for the 3 course surf and turf tasting menu (the entire table has to do it), and the meal was fantastic! It started with soft bread, and then moved on to 3 or 4 different types of salad as well as prosciutto.   The entree portion of the meal included 4 preparings of beef, 3 lobsters claws and tails in a butter sauce, and a number of delicious vegetable sides. I didn't end up eating a lot of the beef, but my friends raved over it. The sides were all fantastic! There were grits, asparagus, mushrooms, and corn. I tend to be more impressed when just as much effort is put into the side dishes, and these were all exceptional.  Dessert was equally fantastic, with sherbet, monkey bread, chocolate souffle, and cheesecake. The monkey bread was by far my favorite!  3 of my friends had the wine pairings, and I opted for a raspberry martini, which was incredibly smooth and fresh-tasting.  It goes without saying you should expect to spend about $200 per person when tax and tip are including. The tasting menu was $160 per person, my martini was $15, and I spent $240 when all was said and done. Not something I do every day, but it was a very special and exceptional meal!",

    "text": "I have got to tell you- this is the first time that I have been let down by my fellow yelpers! Maybe it was just a bad night for the chef- but here are some details of our experience:   1. The service was fine. However, the person who served us didn't fully explain the three course menu (Surf and Turf) to us, so we thought we were getting one appetizer, two types of steak with three sides, two lobster tails, and one dessert. What we got instead was three appetizers, three sides with two steaks, two lobster tails, and three desserts. It was just my husband and I! This could easily have fed about 4-5 people.   2. As a result of #1 above, we paid $500 for a meal that we hardly could finish 25% of. Since we were from out of town, we couldn't save any of it. What a waste. Then again, not sure we would have eaten the leftovers because it was so bland and disappointing.  3. For the appetizers, we had beef tartare (we thought this was all we were going to get), grilled Hawaiian prawns, and Caesar salad. The beef tartare was pretty good, same with the shrimp. I thought the salad was lousy though- the anchovies on top were tart instead of being brined.   4. According to all of the reviews, the wagyu rib eye was supposed to be the best steak ever. What a let down! We ordered ours medium rare and it was cooked too much- so I recommend anyone ordering this to order it rare- at least that way you can have them cook it a little more rather than overcook it to start. It was bland and dry.   5. The skirt steak is the cheapest steak on the menu- about $69- and guess what? Way better than the wagyu. We would have been better off ordering just this a la carte. All the steaks that I have ever had at Ruth Chris have been better than this.   6. The sides- everyone is always raving about the sides. The Yukon potatoes were good, not great. The Jerusalem artichokes and the shitake mushrooms were all average. Again, the sides that I have had at Ruth Chris were all way better than any of these.   8. The lobster was average- nothing special about it at all. I have had better from the frozen section at Trader Joe's.   9. The only dessert that my husband ate was the Monkey Bread, and the only one I ate was the chocolate lava cake and the red pear sorbet. We were so full, and not even happy full if you know what I mean. Again, we have both had better at other places.   10. So $500 for way too much food that tasted average? So not worth it. The steaks with lobster were $155 each, and my husband had ordered the wine pairing. Wine was average, the pours were generous, but for average wine you don't really enjoy it that much.   I love good food and am not afraid to spend money on it. French Laundry cost us about $600 and was worth every penny. This was not. Nobu cost us about $300 and was way better than this. Daniel Boulud was about $150 and again better than this.   From our experience, the high end restaurants in the older hotels did not live up to the hype- the newer ones all did (the exception is Nobu- that place is a must visit when in Vegas).   Go to Ruth Chris if you want a good steak!",

The appetizers were decent, but the entrees were let downs, particularly the sides. The potato puree was soupy and the mushrooms were dry. We asked for a sauce for the mushrooms and were told that \"they don't do any mushrooms with sauces.\" The bread and dessert were the highlights, we shared an orange basil sorbet that was refreshing.

Lobster, sweet corn, asparagus & potato gratin. *drools at the memory* Let me just say that I  am so happy I followed my first mind and ordered the potato gratin vs. the puree(I overheard the couple next to us complaining that the puree was simply melted butter infused with a pinch of potato... How dreadful!) Welp, our potatos gratin were perfectly creamy and seasoned. The hubs said the filet was the best steak he has ever had. It was cooked medium well , seasoned and nice & juicy. Lobster sat in a tasty butter with mushrooms & shaved pea pods. Corn was fresh off the cob and the asparagus didn't disappoint. As if all that goodness wasn't enough we had the nerve to order the monkey bread w/ banana ice-cream for dessert...... Whatever you do, pleeaaasee leave room for this wonderful, sent from above, melt in your mouth, gooey scrumptious delicacy!!!!!! If you have an appetite and are in the mood for a classy sit down then you must stop by.  *Sorry. No pix to accompany this review. I greedily indulged before I even thought about snapping a photo :-/",

    "text": "After a long day of non-stop action and losing money like degenerate gamblers. We decided to try this place   from foodnetwork star chef.   Decor and ambiance is very nice and modern. There isn't a dress code we were dressed casual with jeans. The prices are similar to a high end steakhouse. Expect to spend on average $75-100/person.  We went with the three course chef feature. The only dish that stood out in the first course is the filet mignon tartare and spinach salad with pears.  2nd course we had the filet and N.Y. strip.... it wasn't bad but coming from Texas you can't compare to some of the steakhouse here.  Dessert was delicious especially the mini monkey pecan bread and the cheese cake.  Overall it wasn't worth the $400 we spent for two people.",

Let's start with drinks, the Key Lime and Pineapple Upside Down Cake martinis are both knock out delicious. Get one and be thankful you won't go another day without drinking it.  I don't do apps here because the sheer size of the steak will be plenty. I split the mashed potatoes with a friend, we each had plenty so no need to order your own side. I got the Rib Eye, which was large and amazing. Also on table were the NY Strip, large and amazing, and some fries, which were plentiful and amazing.   Call ahead for a reservation, and yes I kept calling everything large and amazing for a reason. You won't be let down here.",

    "text": "We came during restaurant week to try the $50 menu. While normally I'd say this is no indication of their regular food.. these guys offer this menu quite frequently (the pre show dinner packages with Ka, the summer $60 menu promo they did, etc). So if you do this menu all the time, you should have it down to a science. Additionally, restaurant week is a great time to show off your restaurant.... apparently these guys didn't get the memo!  On to the review. We came in and they informed us they were out of the quail and the chicken and it would be subbed with proscuitto and skirt steak. BOO. Seriously, anticipate restaurant week and how busy you'll be.. don't run out of crap. That's BS.   Proscuitto, peppers, etc that came as the apps were all fine. Nothing special, just fine. Then, the \"kobe\" steak came. Wow I can't believe they served this dog food. Seriously this steak made the prime rib at Outback look amazing. Chewy texture, bad taste.. nothing redeeming. The skirt steak they subbed for the chicken wasn't good also. It was like fajita meat covered in rosemary. Seriously these were two of the worst steaks I've had in a long time.. what a disappointment.  Now the dessert story.. oh man. They brought us chocolate cake with \"espresso\" ice cream. The ice cream was surrounding the cake and it tasted awful. We couldn't figure out what made it taste so disgusting. We asked the waiter \"are you sure this is espresso ice cream?\" and he said \"YES\"... \"are you really sure\"... \"umm ok I'll go check\". Sure enough it was f-ing Earl Grey tea ice cream. How sick is that? Seriously if you are out of espresso put vanilla on the plate. Don't serve gross tea ice cream with a chocolate cake and call it espresso.   A very disappointing evening. At least we got off cheap!",

I also had the wine pairing which was done with precision and ease.  Three course menu consisted of: Three Salads to share: Had Frisee bacon and poached egg, Traditional Caesar, and then the Prosciutto and Figs. All were tasty, fresh, large. Entree of 4 Full  Steaks of our choice of American Wagyu: RIb-eye, Flank, Filet, and NY Strip. Again, all were well prepared (medium rare), buttery, rich and definitely lived up to the expectation of Wagyu. Was definitely an interesting  tasting to compare and contrast the four cuts, would recommend to all. Dessert: 6! Desserts to share (of what appetite we had left, including berries, ice cream, tarts, not sure what wasn't included.  Professional steakhouse, tough to justify trying others when in Vegas, but maybe we will one of these days.",

The lobster bisque was outstanding but the same could not be said about the seafood platter, asparagus or the fries. The meat was acceptable. My bone in Rib eye was well cooked but lacked much flavor. This place seems to be a magnet to large corporate parties or groups participating in some conference. In other words, there was a lack of atmosphere. I'd rather go to StripSteak, N9NE, Delmonico, SW or Prime.",

The positives: 1)  The sides were amazing!  The roasted cauliflower and broccoli and the potatoes au grating were so yummy 2)  Great cocktails 3)  Impeccable service  Maybe you'll have a better experience if you order your steak a touch under what you actually want since they lean towards over cooking  :)",

The decor was kind of steam-punk contemporary, I guess, with the bathroom looking like a really clean (and luxurious?) boiler room.  The chairs were comfortable, and the candles on the table were nice, as well.  We had a special order on a steak, and the chef was happy to accomodate us on it without any difficulty.  We were first served a very delicious and buttery loaf of bread, with sea salt on top.  It was really great for such a simple dish, without the frou-frou stuff you tend to see in expensive restaurants.    The steak was cooked to perfection, tender and full of flavor, and the scallops were perfect.  Truly a great combination.  They were very large and thick.  I can't remember what they said was on them, but it was a unique taste I hadn't had before.  We also had mushrooms and a great-tasting tartare, both of which I enjoyed very much.  I really enjoyed Craftsteak overall, with good service, delicious food, and a great overall experience.",

The steak and the sides were great, the portions were humongous, the desserts were delightful, but was it worth $460 for 2 people?  Uhhh....not so  much.  Yes the meal was better than your run of the mill chains like Claim Jumper or TGI Fridays, but for half the price at a place at let's say....Ruth Chris' Steak House, I would say I'd stick with that.  We had the pre-set menu with the American Wagyu Surf N Turf.  For a special occasion, like Valentines Day, yes it is well worth it.  But would I go on a regular basis?  Probably not, I'm going to stick with Morton's or Maestro's for my usual Steak cravings.",

I had the filet mignon and my bf had the tbone.  They were both cooked to perfection, so tender and juicy.  We ordered asparagus, carrots and potatoes au gratin for the sides.  The asparagus and the potatoes were so good and they give very good sized portions...I took off one star because I was not a fan of the carrots...me and my boyfriend ate one piece each and could not stomach another piece...pass on the carrots!  Other than that the food was great, so great I stuffed myself and had no room for dessert, which really bummed me out because I wanted to try their monkey bread (I heard it is yummy!)",

Love the steak and scallops the most, but everything was excellent including the mashed potatoes and starter salads (loved those red peppers!).

The seating was not perfect, but man, who knows that a reservation is needed to get a good seating in a half filled restaurant on a Monday night in low low season. Ok, seating was confortable. Drinks were ok, and the food was good - period, good, but not enough to jump around and yell out the chefs name in praise - but that is exactly what I had expected here.  Size doesnt impress me, wondering why it had to be a 10oz Filet and esp. wondering why it had to be $56 (!!!)...whoa - thats more than Prime 112 in Miami.

We ordered the American Wagyu surf and turf and NY strip steak, with potato gratin and sauteed spinach sides. The beef was delicious but wasn't quite deserving of the steep price tag. We finished off with the liquid chocolate cake; again, it was good but not quite the spectacular success I expected and desired to see out of good ole Tom. So the overall experience was surprisingly flat and just not quite there. Even the dimly lit ambience and round booth (I love booths!), which I usually appreciate made the place seem boring and sedated. The one saving grace (and the reason why I didn't go as low as three stars) was the service. Our waiter was attentive and helpful in explaining the different types of Kobe (American, Australian and Japanese).",

I don't know how else to describe, but it was a big portion for two and we finished it all. Actually by the time we finished with the tartare, I thought I was done for the night, but no, they brought out the steaks and our sides and I couldn't help but dive in again.   The filet was cooked to perfection, medium rare, the way I love it, red and still bleeding. The meat was so tender and juicy (I only finished half, but makes for great leftovers).   One side you must absolutely order is the Yukon Gold Puree, I have no idea how its made, but its literally potato heaven in your mouth.",

Again, nothing special about the asparagus and carrots, but still perfectly cooked leaving your mouth watering for more.    I'd highly recommend spliting a-la-cart items.  It seem like their combos are way too over priced.    Service was great and they know their wine!",

    "text": "Oh Tom, how your restaurant disappointed me! And oh man what a wind bag I am with this single post!  Was in Vegas for the 4th of July with some of my family and Craftsteak was picked for dinner one night. Now the wife and I are huge fans of the Top Chef series, so we naturally had high expectations for this restaurant. We were under no illusion that good 'ole Tom would be cooking for us,but with his brand stamped on the restaurant, it should have still been outstanding.  The breakdown:  First course- 2 orders of the hand cut Wagyu Tartare - this was fairly tasty but it wasn't outstanding. I would have expected a bit more depth of flavor given it is at minimum a Wagyu/Angus blend.  Arugula Salad - simple but very tasty - not the crappy Arugula I get from Trader Joe's  Heirloom Tomato Salad- really just sliced heirloom tomato's, but they were good  Buffalo Mozzarella Salad - I didn't eat this but the sister-in-law seemed pleased with it.  Second Course-  Porterhouse for two - My wife and I shared this meal (as designed) and we were wholly unimpressed. The meat did have the slight funky essence (a good thing) that comes from dry aging but man was this thing under seasoned. Also, beyond the slight pungency, there was really no other flavor there. I mean, if I can grill a non-prime cut t-bone in my backyard and get more flavor out of it, there is something wrong here. Who knows, maybe an off day or a bad cut, but at $96 that should not have happened.  My bro and his wife order the same porterhouse, but ask that after grilling to a med-rare, take 2/3rds of the filet portion and grill to med-well for his wife. They seemed to like their steak (he picked the place so he wouldn't complain :-) but the server totally forgot their instructions and they had to ask them to take the filet portion back to be grilled further. At a place such as this, you should not have a forgetful server.  Braised Short Ribs - My other bro ordered this and it was really a knockout. I am not a huge braised meat fan because usually the meat has such an intense wine flavor that it drowns out the meat flavor. This version really had the perfect balance and I can understand why it is a signature dish.  Sides  Baby Spinach - meh, it is baby spinach with garlic. No real finesse here but edible  Baby Shitake - pretty good flavor, would order again. You really want the mushrooms to shine and I think they accomplished this.  White Corn Grits - I love smoky bacon/pig flavor and this had it. The problem is that is all it had - the pork totally overwhelmed the dish..I mean really no balance whatsoever.   Service I mentioned the slip up earlier, but the service was really not up to par. It seemed like the servers got board of us and were not particularly attentive. I've eaten in some very suspect joints in my life, but in those cases I expect little or no service. Here, it should have been top notch and it was not. I don't want to feel like I was bothering the server, but that is what we all felt like at the end of the meal.  I might consider going here again just to see if this was really an off night or if it was par for the course, but there are so many other options in Vegas I cannot really see that happening. Here's hoping you have better luck and that Tom stops in and teaches his chef's how to season properly!",

    "text": "Pretty disappointed with my experience here, which is sad since I was excited to dine here.  I booked a 7:45 reservation, knowing I had to catch a show across the street at 10:00. When we arrived at 7:40, they let us know that they were running a little late on seating people but would let us know, so off to the bar we went....  25 minutes later, we were FINALLY seated, and we reminded the waiter(s) that we had a show to catch. The lobster bisque everybody raved about was OK - just OK. The bread that came in the little cute skillet was better than OK but nothing amazing. We ordered drinks, and that did not come until I was done with my first course.  The rib eye I got was nicely cooked, but unfortunately due to lack of time, I only got to eat half of it. The sides we ordered - hen of the woods mushroom didn't taste anything different from me roasting my own mushrooms - not sure what the big deal was with that side. The kale with white beans and bacon was SO salty we could barely eat half of it. The only saving grace to this whole meal was the potato puree - it was silky smooth and flavored perfectly.   As it's 9:20 I'm looking for my waiter - there was three introduced to me, yet none seem to be found anywhere? When I finally got their attention to pack up my food and  give me a bill, we were given an after-dinner pastry with mint filling which I really liked (I think there was basil in the filling which was a nice touch).  Then I walk to my theater and they tell me no food is allowed, so after dropping $200 on dinner, I was told I couldn't keep my leftovers... Now, if I had that extra 25 minutes to eat and really enjoy my dinner without rushing, maybe I wouldn't be so upset about the whole experience. Probably won't be back here again.",

Honestly, they could have served up an ill-prepared steak and I still would have rated at least 4 stars for the heavenly rolls and brussel sprouts alone. However, the quality and preparation of my filet mignon was nothing short of to die for. I'm a freak about red meat and always request well done (steak connoisseurs: feel free to vilify me for this) and somehow Craftsteak managed to deliver a well-done steak that was still moist, tender, and literally falling apart on my fork. Need I say more?  I echo other commenter's sentiments about the size of the side dishes. For those of you who might turn your nose up at $15-20 veggie sides, think again. Two of us could barely finish the brussel sprouts and didn't even make a dent in the grits (waiter's recommendation). I bucked the red wine norm and went with a glass of prosecco, which was actually reasonably priced for a 4 diamond restaurant.   Whatever you do: GET EXTRA ROLLS.",

We had walked by Craftsteak many times on previous trips and decided that this would be a good place to splurge and celebrate our new legal status.  ... and it was alright. I wasn't blown away like I kind of expected / hoped, but I wasn't exactly disappointed.  We were seated in a large plush booth in the main dining room and had a wonderful server. He got our drink orders to us right away, brought us some very tasty bread, and explained that the items on the menu are meant to be enjoyed \"family style\"... meaning there will be large portions to share.  We split a Caesar salad as an appetizer because we thought it would be enough for two, but it turned out that it really wasn't all that large. It was very good though! I discovered that I really like pickled white anchovies! We each ordered a medium-rare filet mignon for our main course. I ordered a side of risotto, and my husband ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms. Now -those- were some large portions!  I didn't care much for the risotto. I think it was underdone. The mushrooms were good. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and were tasty, but I'd had -much- better at Annie's Paramount Steakhouse on 17th Street in Washington DC just a few days before.   The drinks were good, the atmosphere was excellent, the service was excellent, and the server was very kind to bring us a small sweet something as a way of congratulating us on our marriage. Overall it was kind of a mixed bag.   Still, I'm glad we finally went. We can finally stop talking about going there \"one day\".",

Of course, when you walk into a really nicely decorated place where the lighting is dim, you always want to think to yourself, \"is this place as good as it looks?\"   My date and I immediately were seated for our reservation at 7pm. The hostess walked us back to where we were seated and then minutes later we were followed up by our server who nicely introduced himself offering either iced water or sparkling water. I also got a glass of pinot noir to accommodate my meal.  We look over the menu, (so much to choose from!), appetizer of mozzarella stuffed with sun dried tomatoes topped with basil and a salad with special house dressing.   As we wait, a in house photographer, associated with \"Cashman photos\" asked us if we wanted to take our pictures. Not a usual request sitting at a restaurant, but hey, why not? Something to make the night even more memorable, right? She told us how to pose and took a few pictures.   Here comes the really good stuff, the entrees! For him, a filet mignon, for me, baked salon (TO DIE FOR). It literally melted in my mouth and was mouth watering. WOW! They sure know how to cook a salmon! For our side dishes, baked macaroni, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. MMMMMMM. Mashed potatoes was one of a favs here too.  We didn't end up getting desert because we were: 1) too full 2) satisfied with our meal. The nice photographer came back two sets of fold out albums. She told us that we could choose our favorite photos to place in the albums. Yeah, they were a little pricey but they came out so nice! Loved it! She also threw in two more set of wallets.   End cap: one of the most memorable nights perfected with an awesome date and a blissful dinner followed by the show \"Ka\" by Cirque de Soleil. Now that's a real DATE!",

    "text": "This place is a joke. My brother took me to Vegas for my first time last month (he's been out 11 times) and left the reservations up to me. I spent weeks researching and reading reviews, eventually making the mistake of choosing this place.   First off, we were seated at the most uncomfortable table I've ever sat at. I was on a couch where I couldn't lean back, had no arm rests, and wasn't firm enough to sit up. I was stuck in limbo trying to be comfortable without dropping food everywhere.  The first sommelier we spoke with was very kind and helpful, but he left shortly after and was replaced by another guy that let our glasses go dry several times. The worst part was the attitude he gave us when we wanted his attention. He was too busy watching the NBA playoffs on the TV and couldn't be bothered.   The bread was actually amazing, I'll give them that. The steak tartar was good and a surprisingly large portion. I'm on the fence about the lobster bisque; part of me likes the tarragon in it and part of me thinks it was overpowering.   Now onto my biggest gripe (well maybe tied with the attitude of the waitstaff). We both ordered a $120 Wagyu filet expecting some amazing, melt in your mouth, meaty goodness. Instead we get served two pieces of meat that could've passed for chuck. It was a hassle to both cut and chew, I've bough better steaks at my local supermarket. And on top of that it came smothered in some wine reduction that wasn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. If I'm ordering what is supposed to be a delicious high-end cut of beef I want to taste it. I don't want it smothered in some sauce that I didn't ask for.   We went to Oscar's the following night and paid $56 for a filet that was much more tender and prepared right. With a nice crust, salt, and pepper. And we were treated like family by the staff who actually appreciated our business instead watching a basketball game.",

When looking through the hundreds of restaurant choices in Vegas, we came across this spot in the MGM and with Tom's name on it from Top Chef fame we had to try it. We are so glad we did.   From start to finish this was one of the best meals I have ever had traveling. Even the hot lightly salted rolls were delicious. The drinks, appetizers (seafood platter/carpaccio plate) to the main course surf and turf filet and lobster were to die for. The beef was so tender it cut like butter and you could slice it with your fork. The service treated you like a king and who the heck cares about price in a place like this, it was worth every penny and let me tell you there were a lot of them in this bill so bring your wallet or maybe two wallets. For four people this was like a small downpayment on a car.   I will be sure to visit the other Craft steak locations as this blew away every type of chain steak restaurant out there including Capital Grill and Ruth Chris. They arent even in the same league! Do yourself a favor and make this first choice when in Vegas!",

And service is great too,. 1.5 less star as we asked for 3 different steaks (filet mignon, prime, ny strip) all medium rare but they were cooked -really- differently, one too cooked, the other one not enough. I was fine with it but it did bother my friends. But great experience overall",

When we made our reservation, we let them know we were part of a bachelorette party, and they welcomed our bride with a nice congratulations card. A great way to start the evening.  The ambiance is dark and sophisticated, very clean lines and simple designs. There was nothing too fancy. However, we did appreciate how the restaurant had separate rooms. Each room had three to four tables, which made it feel very intimate and warm.  The food... is good. The baby beet salad is hearty with four varieties of beets and a simple dressing. I also enjoyed the artichoke salad. It was light and refreshing. Portions of both were very big.  For the main course, I had the sirloin. It was tender, flavorful and cooked just right. A girlfriend of mine got the lamb shanks - It was SO good... I wish I had ordered it instead of the steak! It was also a very large portion, probably enough to feed three people.   For the sides, I highly recommend the cremini mushroom risotto... if I wasn't wearing a tight dress, I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. :)  I'd take off one star because while the restaurant was fantastic, it does not have any WOW factor that is often in many Vegas establishments... I could probably get the same experience in Chicago. I'd suggest they do something different with the decor. Something fun!  Strong drinks. Great wine list and pairing recommendations. Dress to impress.",

    "text": "My fiance went here for his bachelor party and as a nice gesture I had purchased two bottles of Vueve Clicquot with a note sent to his table.  I had one of the groomsmen purchase two bottles and request the waitress to rewrite the note neatly to present to the bachelor.  The waitress, and older Btgritish/english lady, totally dismissed the request of neatly writing the note and and at that gave the note to the WRONG person in the groomsmen party.  They went ahead and just started pouring bottles of champagne as if though the groomsmen party ordered it.  For a restaurant that is about presentation and quality service, this was a complete fail for Craftsteak.  There was no follow through in customer request in making it a great dining experience for a significant occasion.  For a reputable steakhouse you would think there would be better customer service or some concern for wanting to please the customer.  In the future, I will not be making arrangements with Craftsteak for a special occasion or spending a dime there.",

We started with the Wagyu Kobe steak tartare and it was probably the most amazing appetizer ever. The steak melted in your mouth like butter. I shared an aged ribeye cooked rare with my buddy and was perfect - lightly charred on the outside, with just enough seasoning (no need for steak sauce) and super tender and moist on the inside. Another group at our table had the porter house and the filet mignon section was probably sent form heaven. At the end of our meal one of our buddies wanted a dessert not on the menu and our waitress had the pastries chef make it especially for us! Great service, great food, good atmostpehere. The only thing missing was a personal visit from Tom Colicchio himself. Job well done.",

    "text": "4.5 stars! On your way to Vegas? Can't decide where to eat? Sushi, Italian, French, seafood, or even a famous Vegas buffet? With so many choices, a decision can be difficult. Let me give you a suggestion: How about Craftsteak? Craftsteak is fine dining, exquisite ambience, professional service, scrumptious food, and hearty portions. Yes, you will have to drop some serious scratch and, yes, you will need a reservation. Listen, if you have even to ask these two questions then this place is not for you. I'm talking about fine dining at an elite steak house on the Strip. If you don't understand what that consists of, please stop reading this and wasting your time (The 99 cent value meal from the golden arches and the two for one buffet are down the street). Reservations were for a Friday evening at 7:15pm. Arrived approximately 7:10pm and was seated right away. Restaurant was packed. Hostess proceeded to seat us in an awesome booth in the corner of the dining room. Perfect view to see everything that was going down as well as everyone coming and going. At first glance the menu can be a little daunting, but with help from the knowledgeable server, ordering was a breeze. (Hint: Go with what they call the chef's menu) We decided on the Wagyu Beef menu-Three salads, three side dishes, two cuts of meat and three desserts.  We also had the audacity to order the Maine lobster a la carte. We decided to go this route instead of ordering the Wagyu surf and turf for one simple reason. With the surf and turf you don't get to choose your cuts of meat. The way we ordered, we got to choose our cuts of meat and still get the lobster.  After placing our menu selections we received homemade rolls, which were excellent. A few minutes later we received grilled prawns. Simultaneously my girlfriend and I looked at each other and promptly informed our server we did not order that particular dish. He informed us that each table receives a warm appetizer. I hate to say it, but the prawns were our least favorite dish. Not bad, but just could have done without. The salads followed and were absolutely spectacular. We ordered: the Persian cucumber, watercress and ginger; the wild arugula, shaved pecorino, and pine nuts; and last, but definitely not least, the Italian buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts. All three were unbelievable. At this point we were very satisfied with the quality of the food and service. But let's continue on to the main course. Our sides included kale with pancetta and navy beans, heirloom cauliflower with garlic, and faro with pork confit and wild mushrooms. All three were divine. The kale dish had a real southern flavor (and was my personal favorite of the side dishes).  The cauliflower dish was not only visually stunning but also delectable (the girlfriend's favorite side dish). The faro was absolutely delicious as well! As if you didn't know what was coming next. Yes, the MEAT. We ordered the Wagyu Filet Mignon and the Ribeye. Both cuts were cooked perfect (rare to medium rare). Tender, juicy, melt in your mouth goodness. To be completely honest with you, words cannot and have not done this meal justice. Absolute culinary mastery. Except for one thing... what happened to the lobster? We never received the lobster. My girlfriend and I noticed early in our main course that the lobster was not there, but both of us decided not to say anything unless it ended up on the bill. (Maybe the server didn't hear our order correctly, or maybe another server grabbed the dish by accident and our server thought someone else brought it out. I don't know.)  But, we were both so full at this point I was actually secretly glad we didn't receive the lobster. I don't know if we could have eaten any more without bursting at the seams. Dessert, oh sweet dessert! If you have read any of my other reviews you would know I am a big fan of French press coffee.  Craftsteak has one of the best French press coffees I have had. Next came FOUR desserts: Fresh fruit, Chocolate torte with homemade creme fraiche and orange marmalade, Mango basil and lemon sorbets, and Cinnamon Monkey Bread with Cinnamon Ice Cream! Are you effing kidding?! Heaven on earth! The cinnamon monkey bread was out of this world. Pure bliss! Upon receiving the bill, I informed the server that we never received the lobster. He was very apologetic, adjusted the bill, and gave us the coffee on the house. Craftsteak was a memorable experience. I would love to give Craftsteak five stars, but just can't.  Five stars is perfection! If the prawns would have never come out of the kitchen and the lobster would have; Craftsteak would and probably could have achieved just that. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend Craftsteak for any occasion and would most definitely go back!  10-4 good buddy. I'm out!",

    "text": "YUM.  There were 5 of us and 4 had the ribeye and I had the tuna. The sides we ordered were: asparagus, brussel sprouts, mushroom risotto, leek&garlic scalloped potatoes.  Let me say it again, YUM!!  The server was extremely helpful and told us 3 sides would've been plenty for us, along w/our entrees, but we got a little greedy and excited. Plus we were really hungry.  My tuna was cooked perfectly, the steaks were juicy and sizzling.   Out of all the sides, i think the brussel sprouts were my favorite. And the mushroom risotto. The brussel sprouts were cooked so the outside was a bit crispy on the edges and gave a nice crunch when you bit into them, not soggy or overcooked at ALL. The risotto was on point as well, lots of flavor.  We also had dessert, which was monkey bread that night with caramel ice cream. That ice cream was delicious but way too sweet for me. The bread was nice and sticky, as monkey bread should be.  All in all, it was a great experience eating at Tom Colichhio's restaurant. We almost didnt get a table bc we called and were told taht the next available seat was at 915pm. But we went in anyway and managed to get a table at 715pm instead.   Definitely one of the top meals i've had. Granted it's a bit pricey, but you are extremely full and happy at the end of it.",

A few months before my visit to Craftsteak in Las Vegas, I made reservations to his LA restaurant Craft for my birthday and decided to go to Mastro's instead. After eating at Craftsteak, I'm kind of glad I changed my mind. Craftsteak was sadly disappointing. My steak was cooked fine and the other dishes we ordered were fine, but nothing was worth noting. Like CUT, I just don't understand the hype. It might just be me... but I feel that these restaurants in Vegas, True to the Vegas style are too focused on decor and making the place \"sparkle\". Also I thought service was underwhelming - not bad, but not impressive (maybe my expectations are too high for steakhouses).",

    "text": "I took a client to CraftSteak on my last visit to Las Vegas to celebrate a successful negotiation and overall business trip.  I had never eaten in one of Tom Colicchio's establishments but had wanted to for some time.  My first trip was an absolute home run.  Seated at the bar because we hadn't made a rezzie, which was fine with both of us, the bartender, JT was a tip top pro.  Courteous, attentive without being pushy, and knowledgeable.  In addition to the suggestions he made for us, I listened to him him with a couple other patrons regarding scotch, wine, and food.  Normally you'll hear sort of rote suggestions across the board, but he listened to what they were looking for and made specific comments and recommendations.  I suggest you seek him out should you be at the bar.  Normally I don't do a blow by blow of what I ordered, but this meal was exceptional...  I had the Frisee Salad,  NY Strip (not the kobe), with sides of Mashed Potatoes, and White Corn.   A client  had warned me that the sides were ridiculously good and they did not disappoint.  The Frisee was served warm with house-cured bacon with soft, creamy, and very pungent orbs of Blue Cheese interspersed.  JT was not sure what kind of Blue Cheese it was (he offered to find out), but I commented that you didn't get cheated on the portion, which made him smile.  I couldn't stop eating it.  The NY Strip is prepared bone-on, and then the bone is removed from the strip but served should you decide to attack it. (Yeah, I did).  It was cooked exactly as I'd asked.  I used to be a pure medium-rare guy but as I've begun to climb in years have moved to med-rare plus.  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious and the sweet white corn succotash the perfect foil.  I was such a hog that I even had the Monkey Bread with Caramel-Cinnamon Ice Cream and a Cappuccino for dessert.   Not a place to go on the cheap or on a diet.  Be prepared...and enjoy.  If you're in the mood for a steak, gastronomically, it's the bomb.  JT called it a \"death-row\" meal.  (As in if you were on death row and had a last meal)  I'd have to concur.  Fortunately, I get to go back.",

I started with a Sapphire and Tonic, probably my most favorite drink.  It was mixed well and they actually had plump limes as the lime juice really brings all the flavors together into one cohesive taste for your palate.  During dinner I had a classic gin martini, Tanqueray No. 10 was used.  The Tanqueray No. 10 has a more full rolling flavor rather than the regular Tanqueray that, I feel hits with a hard sharp punch.  The martini was mixed well.  The girlfriend had their apple martini, it was also mixed well, tasted like candy, couldn't even tell there was rum in it.  Food, me and my lady got the american wagyu tasting menu and had the server surprise us for the menu.  She did an awesome job.  This tasting menu comes with two appetizers per person, one steak per person, two sides per person, and two desserts per person.  Appetizers:   Arugula salad with sliced radishes with a thai lime vinaigrette.  Peppery with the mild earthiness of the radish and wrapping it together with the sourness from the lime in the vinaigrette.  Spinach salad with sliced red onions, sliced cucumbers, with a bleu cheese vinaigrette.  Buffalo mozzarella drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, topped with diced tomatoes, roasted macadamia nuts and garnished with some toasted fennel.  Grilled Hawaiian prawns.  This was really good, lemon and cocktail sauce on the side.  Don't forget to suck those heads.  Mains: Domestic wagyu 10oz filet mignon and domestic wagyu 12oz skirt steak.  Cooked slightly under medium-rare.  Both cuts had very good marbling, flavored perfectly and cooked how I like it.  Very very tasty!  Sides: Yukon gold puree, mushroom assortmet (four types), sauteed baby broccoli.  All were really good.  The potato puree would be the highlight for the sides as they were rich and creamy and a nice surprising twist to the normal mashed potatoes.    Desserts: Roasted pineapple It was good, but didn't really do anything for me  Sorbets, Orange basil, the orange and basil really mixed well, unfortunately being so full, the basil was a little more pungent than I would have liked.  Second sorbet, Cabernet Concord grape, this was great the grape flavor was not too tangy and mixed well with the Cabernet.  Chocolate ganash cake with sweet cream.  I really liked this, dark chocolate, not too sweet, the addition of the sweet cream on the side made it perfect.  Nice warm oozing chocolate center mixed with cake and topped with sweet cream.  Pear cranberry crumble topped with a scoop of ginger iced cream.  Good texture in the crumble and flavor mixed with the sweetness of the pear followed by a very slight tang from the cranberry.  The ginger iced cream hits you with a medium sharp ginger flavor then mellows out as it melds with the flavor of the pear.  Works great.  This was a very tasty meal.  There was enough food to feed another person.  They even packed it up for us to go.  Not only did they pack up the food, they gave us another glass to take or unfinished martinis.  Great service, great food.",

    "text": "This review is going to be a little odd but shows that how a world class restaurant can turn around a customer experience that is going south fast and render a 5 star lifelong fan in the process. My husband and I were visiting and make a 6:30 reservation in advance of a show we needed to get to across the Strip at 9pm.  Probably a little tight for a 5 star place but we figured we could make it.  Arrive at 6:30, sorry we are running late - will be 20 minutes. Ok, we'll go gamble for a few minutes. Back at 6:50 - still no go.  People were piling up at the door.  The underaged hostesses were starting to lose it and tempers were flaring.  7:15 still no go, but they are now saying \"any minute\" but with no explanation, no offered glass of wine - avoiding eye contact.  There must have been 7-8 parties this was happening too including a poor woman in her wedding dress with her party of 8.  Well we stuck it out (Saturday night in Vegas so where are you going to go without a reservation!) and sat down to eat at 7:40!!  Well, now here comes the good part. We told the waiter - we have a 9pm show.  He did not bat an eyelash, proceeded to give us recommendations of which dishes he could fire fastest, how to order everything and said no problem!! And man, did this guy deliver. We got the tasting menu with the Waygu and everything came out perfectly and on time. Wine was on the table in minutes.  He boxed up and substituted a dessert for us that would survive the show (ie took off the ice cream and put on some yummy pastry).  THIS man knew how a fine dining experience should be done and we sat down, pissed off and negative and walked out, loving the place.  And now the food. Wow, wow, wow.  After the early entree to the establishment, we really thought this better damn well be worth it! And oy vey was it.  We had the cheaper Waygu tasting menu, I the filet and husband the Ribeye - and this was simply the most sublime steak experience of my life.  Perfection in the cooking would be understatement - it was just off the hook great.  Everything else that came out was equally impressive, sides of spinach and sweet potatoes, a Lobster Bisque soup that was simply amazing in it simplicity and freshness.  The Parker House rolls they feed you are divine as well.    Anyway, hats off Tom Colicchio, as what was going to be a very bad review, has become a great one. I would go back in a second for that kind of professionalism. The prices are not for the squeamish but I am pretty sure you know that walking in right?  But for what you get, the tasting menu is a decent value. I really actually want to knock off one star for the really poor front of house experience with the hostess staff, but alas, I just can't do it!",

I would highly recommend that to start.  I also had the watercress and cucumber salad which was also delightful and a nice light start to the meal.  I ordered the rack of lamb...rare.  It was incredible.  I did notice it was a little on the fatty side, but the cut was nice and big and it was so delicious, that no matter how full I felt, I had to finish it.  The table got quite a few sides...assorted mushrooms, pureed sweet potatoes, fingerling potatoes, asparagus and potatoes au gratin.  I wasn't a huge fan of the fingerling potatoes...it was just baked and lacked flavor.  The pureed sweet potatoes were my favorite with the asparagus a close second.  For dessert, you must get the Monkey Bread.  That was absolutely incredible.  I wasn't too fond of the pairing with the Brown Sugar Sour Cream ice cream, but a good vanilla ice cream would be great with the monkey bread.  The ambiance is great although I would do without the paintings of cows with a steak cut written on it.  That is just plain wrong.  lol!",

    "text": "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! I read one yelper's comments that the beef was melt in your mouth good and I have to say I totally agree. If something other than sex can give you an orgasm...I would have to say, I almost came after my first bite of the Kobe Skirt Steak.   I had the Chef Tasting menu - Domestic Wagu Beef for $130 pp.  Don't be scared by the price. Unlike some tasting menus which hardly fill you up, theirs has enough food with leftovers. Note that the food is served family style.   They usually require the whole party to order the tasting menu but we asked if my girlfriend who was pregnant could order a-la-carte b/c she shouldn't be eating rare beef and let's face it...there is no point in eating a well-done steak. The waiter was very accommodating. Because it was just (2) of us ordering the tasting menu, they only gave us (2) cuts of meat instead of their usual (3). It was not an issue b/c there was so much food. Note: I am a BIG eater. We started off with a salad, scallops and kobe beef tartare. I was very hesitant in eating 100% raw beef but was dying to give it a try. Only Tom Colicchio can pull this off for me. It was very very tasty.   We were given the Ribeye and Skirt Steak. Again, it was awesome as I first described and want to keep this review PG rated. It came with several sides. I can't seem to remember what they were since my mind is so set on the steak.   The desserts were also oh-so tasty. There was a corn ice cream that my girlfriends didn't care too much for but I liked it.",

    "text": "My quick version of this review is that I had the best steak I have ever had in my life.   The longer version: We were seated promptly and were served by a very knowledgeable waiter. He knew a lot of details regarding the steak. All 4 of us went with the Chef Menu. For the cut of meat, we chose the A5 Wagyu filet only.  We also added the lobster bisque which is an absolute must. Large chunks of lobster and a fantastic creamy taste.  We then had the tartar which was fantastic as well. Tasted extremely fresh. I could eat a pound.   We then got our steaks. Bottom line, the best steak I've had and I've had steak in many steakhouses, including in Kobe. Melts in your mouth and has a lot of taste. If you don't like the taste of fat, the standard filet might actually taste better to you. I highly recommend the filet A5.   The sides were mostly great. The mashed/purred potatoes were amazing and the other potato sides were very good to great. While you're eating the steak though, nothing really tastes close.   For dessert we got the monkey bread, sorbet, pineapple in a cinnamon sauce, and a couple it her items. Bottom line the monkey bread is the only thing we should have gotten. Everything else except the horrible passion fruit sorbet (which my friend rightly said tasted like fish. Lol) Monkey bread is my favorite dessert.   The meal, suffice it to say, was not cheap. About 1,500 for 4, including tax/tip. None of us had alcohol.",

Best, best, best meal of my life. First of all they butcher all of the meat there, it melts in your mouth. When we arrived the chef was offering a special where we could taste many different items from the menu. The scallops were like butter, the bread was hot and the butter was so soft. The yukon potatoes are whipped for 20 minutes and let me tell you it was like a party in my mouth. The meat was so tender and delicious that you didnt even need a steak knife. then when you didnt think it could get better, they brought us this \"pecon, sticky bun\" called monkey bread....I have never in all of my years tasted such gooodness. Now dont get me wrong this meal comes with a heafty price tag, but let me tell you it was worth every single dollar. If I go back to Vegas I will eat there again. you must go!!!",

I liked the fact that the menu had prix fixe options as well as a la carte. We ordered a few side dishes for the whole table, so it was nice to try bites of multiple sides. They were all good, but the sweet potato puree was delicious. A few people at the table got lobster bisque as the first course. They said it was great and filled with lobster, but too heavy to eat right before steak.  The service was attentive and very helpful. The atmosphere could have been better. It was so big and didn't feel very intimate. It almost felt a little cafeteria like.There was a small group of us and the table shape wasn't condusive for coversation.

    "text": "If I didn't have a dress code at work I would probably fashion up myself a shirt that said \"I heart Craftsteak\" and paste in a picture of Tom Colicchio underneath it.  In fact, I may go so far as to put the number of the reservation line on my shirt as well.    Craftsteak offers great decor, amazing service, and 5-star food.    On the plates: Salad, American Kobe Skirt Steak, Potato Gratin w/ Leeks, Duck Confit and Monkey Bread. We ordered all the items separately and they still meshed very well; True testament to great menu planning.  The salad was very simple and had only 1 main green but the seasoning was off the charts.  I'm sure it's just basic salt and pepper, but golly gee does Tom know salt and pepper!  The Skirt steak did not have the obvious problem that most skirt steaks have and was not at all chewy.  The steak had a great buttery consistency and in a very cliche way \"melted in your mouth.\"  I never knew meat could do that, but apparently well trained chefs can finagle skirt steak to accomplish such a feat.   Since leeks are a favorite of Tom's, diners can rest assured knowing that he wouldn't have leeks any other way than perfect.  Lastly, the monkey bread was a great finale to dinner.  Perfectly crisp on the outside the bread is able to be pulled off from the rest of the pieces and maintains softness and airy-ness in the middle.  Frosting accompainment was not too sweet and the cinnamon was not at all overpowering.  A well made dessert.  If you go to one restaurant in Vegas to splurge it better be Craftsteak.  And who knows you too may be in the market for an \"I heart Craftsteak\" shirt.",

The only thing I liked was the quail appetizer which was juicy and tasty but the beefs were not. What a disappointment.   The meal was way overpriced.

Our table was a large group (9) and I suspect this was an unreasonable request.  The starter cocktail was a surprise because so many places don't know how to make a proper Manhattan anymore.  This was perfection. The beet salad was excellent, a great collection of different beet styles.  Hubby had a Caesar salad which was fine (I'm pretty bored by Caesar salad these days, but it wasn't bad).  For an entree, neither of us got steak which might have been a mistake.  Because we have access to some of the best steakhouses on the earth, we usually try non-steak items.  I had rack of lamb which was delicious.  Tender, flavorful, and seasoned to perfection.  The sides I tried risotto, hen of woods mushrooms, brussel sprouts, creamed potatoes, and spinach were wonderful.  The mister ordered salmon which was a disappointment to him (hello, craft...Steak). The end of the meal was a mad dash to pay and make it over to Ka, but we did end up on time after all. I would recommend this for a nice night out, but be careful about taking a large group before a show.",

    "text": "I picked this place for a romantic dinner for our first night in Vegas together.  We only planned on going to one fancy dinner and I did lots of reviewing on yelp to pick someplace great, deciding on Craftsteak after much  deliberation.  My decision was somewhat swayed by the fact that I'm a big fan of Top Chef, and as some of you may know the head judge Tom Collichio is the executive chef of this place.  Well, I think Mr. Tom may need to pack his knives and go.    I was totally disappointed in the food.  We ordered the surf n' turf tasting menu, which was something like $175 each for three courses with wine pairings. We started off with some kind of steak tartare which was not that impressive.  Not bad, but it tasted very strongly of garlic and had no delicacy of flavor.  Not special.  Then came the steak and lobster with a selection of side dishes.  The skirt steak and fillet, both Kobe beef, were well cooked I suppose but not anything better than I've bbq'd up at home.  Not especially tender, not especially well seasoned.  There was a good amount of lobster but it was rubbery and it took some messy work to get half of it out of the shell. The sides included were pomme puree (aka mashed potatoes), sauteed mushrooms, and grilled asparagus.  Seriously.  I order a fancy tasting menu, expecting the best the chef has to offer and he sends out friggin' mashed potatoes?  How is that special?  How is that the best you have to offer? The dessert was some kind of chocolate cake and a selection of sorbets (one of which was red bull flavored.  Seriously?  Red bull is nasty, it's flavor only slightly improved by vodka)  The wine paired with the steak was good.  The other two were unremarkable, and the dessert wine they paired with the chocolate cake was some kind of Sauternes, which I consider to be an inappropriate choice for chocolate.  A late harvest Zin, port, or some sherry would have been much better.    As you've probably gathered I was completely unimpressed.  I'm not the type to complain to management about such things, which is why I'm venting to you all here.  (thank you yelp)    When I pay top dollar for a tasting menu I expect something really special, high quality and creative.  This was none of the above.  I felt seriously ripped off and pist off when leaving this place and the feelings have not subsided.  If Tom had been judging this meal I think he would agree.  He needs to go check on the people running this place because they're ruining his good name.  If you're looking for a interesting and delicious tasting menu from one of the excellent Chefs in Vegas, choose someone else!",

They were both knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. We each had a Caesar salad- big, we probably should have just ordered one and split it. I had the filet and my boyfriend had the rib eye. We shared the potato and leek gratin and it was awesome. Both steaks were phenomenal. We were stuffed at the end of the meal but when both servers suggested the cinnamon monkey bread, we gave in and ordered one to share. It was incredible. Possibly the best part of the meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant, and not eating for as long as possible beforehand to make room for the amazing food. We will be back the next time we go to Vegas!",

The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all outstanding. This time I had the American Wagyu fillet mignon with wild mushrooms as our side. Ms. Graham chose the short ribs and the server brought us a complimentary dish of the mashed potato's. We also chose a half bottle of Zin to wash it all down. Excuse my lack of creative words that I used during my first review. The food is simply the best. The flavors are indescribable. I took my first bite of the Wagyu beef and had to close my eyes to truly appreciate every amazing taste. The short ribs were also out of this world. Fall off the bone outstanding. The potato's were a surprisingly awesome flavor as well. The mushrooms were good but nothing magical (maybe anywhere else but not here).   To sum it all up: Just go. If you are a steak fan and know the value of good food, you'll be blown away also.",

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised by Craftsteak.  Actually, we ended up here over a mix-up in recommendations.  Nevertheless, I was quite impressed.  The waitstaff was great!  I was really impressed with our server Marvin.  He made great recommendations and was attentive to our requests.  For example, during the ordering we were going to order the potatoes au gratin and the jeremiah artichokes but Marvin pointed out that the two veggies might be too starchy.  So we ordered the green beans instead of the artichokes which were delicious.  The potatoes au gratin were okay, nothing special.  The fois gras was delectable.  At first, I didn't really enjoy the candied grapefruit chutney on top but when I ate it together with the fois gras, the combination of flavors was amazing!  Pretty neat combination.  Then, the porterhouse steak for two came out and this was really good and a lot of meat!  Medium rare and tender, just the way I like it.  Again, Marvin made a suggestion for dessert, the bread pudding which was a perfect combo of subtle sweetness and creamy milk and vanilla.  The cappucino was watery, odd for a restaurant to mess that up but oh well.    One particular thing that made me really appreciate the waitsaff was that since there was so much food we got a takeout box.  In the bag was two sets of plastic utensils and a stack of napkins.  I thought that was a nice touch.  I definitely recommend craftsteak to those who are looking for a great steakhouse in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I suppose that I have some explainin' to do, considering that my group of 3 friends and I dropped $500 on dinner here yet only gave it 3 stars.   So, let me start with the sides. We tried the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, gold yukon potato puree and asparagus. The hen of the woods mushrooms were quite good, but nothing I can't put together myself. They had no great sauce, no POW factor. The gold yukon potatoes were fine - nice potatoes that were boiled and pureed to baby-food texture. No special or unique flavors going on there. Finally, I'm convinced the asparagus was just microwaved in some water. Very poor effort there, guys. Considering each of these dishes was $15-$25, I'm very disappointed.   Now, onto some better things. I had the lobster bisque which was very good. Nice and creamy with succulent chunks of lobster. The only complaint I have, if it even counts, is that they served me a ton. It was very rich and I didn't have a cup of bisque, it was a giant bowl.   On to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here, nothing; just pure steak goodness. It was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered.   Overview: The service was impeccable. The wine list was extensive (however out of our price range, at $125 per person without drinks). Though the steaks and bisque were great, the sides were eerily reminiscent of my grandmothers (terrible) cooking. I think Craftsteak is a poor value for your buck, therefore I'll give it 3/5 - A-OK.",

    "text": "I went to Craftsteak with such HIGH expectations because of Tom Colicchio and the recommendations of my Best Friends. Delmonico's at the Venetian is my \"go-to\" steak house in Vegas. With LOTS OF COAXING, I agreed to go to Craftsteak last Saturday night. I was VERY disappointed. The two BEST things of the night were the dinner rolls and the Apple Martini. I ordered the New York steak. I usually ALWAYS order the Rib Eye, but decided to try something new. I ordered it medium - it came to the table medium well. When you are at a high end steakhouse, you expect your steak to be PERFECT. It was not seasoned as well as I had hoped. I had to keep dipping pieces of my steak into the sauce in the pan. And the sauce was just mediocre. For appetizers, my Best Friends had the lobster bisque. We shared the scallops appetizer. I have had better scallops at the Lobster in Santa Monica at the Santa Monica Pier. With our entrees, we ordered the mashed potatoes and honey carrots. The potatoes were pretty good. The carrots were okay. Not what I would expect from such a high end restaurant though. And certainly not on par with other high end steakhouses I have frequented. The Waiter who took our order kept making us repeat ourselves. It was very annoying after the FOURTH time. Also, he forgot to bring me my Apple Martini. We had to ask the other server for it only to discover that it had been sitting at the bar waiting to be picked up for several minutes. I guess I am happy I tried something different. But I will not be visiting Craftsteak any time in the near future.",

The fancy dining sofa's, ass kissing service and iron skillets. It's all good. But what's the use of iron skillets if they don't provide heat? My $60 filet was cold...once again. I hate sending food back. I won't do it. I shouldn't have to.  Sorry, I got ahead of myself. I jumped to the main course.  The bread is very good. That particular iron skillet delivered. I'm reluctant to Yelp anything is good in a sentence because that may become a YELP restaurant highlight.  CraftSteak's beet salad is bland. I don't necessarily like salty food, so that says a lot. Maybe add a chunk of goat cheese. Not daring to be different, but it's a classic pairing. But hey, beets are good for me, so I'll move on...  The risotto was good, with all the tomatoes, bits and pieces, but was served CRUNCHY al dente.   The filet...well you know about my filet. Other than it being coldededed, it was, yes, under seasoned and BLAND. Try a Ruth's Chris steak, so hot, moist and buttery.  Oh, oh, oh....my Dark and Stormy, ginger and rum drink was great.  The service was very good, but I sat at the bar. That's my thing when I want great service. That's a no brainer.  No dessert tonight, even though the Monkey Bread is fan-fuckin-tastic!

I'm a super fan of top chef,the roasted red pepper starter delicious, spinach salad & even the rolls & asparagus perfect and then some! BUT the porterhouse was under seasoned, chewy, fatty and lobster in surf & turf just ok:( I was soo disappointed.",

    "text": "Hubby and I had the rib eye, mushrooms, and their version of mashed potatoes.  The steak was so delicious as it was bursting with wonderful flavor.  The shiitake mushrooms were amazing!  The mashed potatoes was just ok.  I initially ordered a glass of white wine, but decided a few sips later that I needed a glass of Pinot Noir to pair with my steak instead.  Our waitress gladly obliged with my request.    I wish I can dock off half a star because of the picture they take of you at your table.  A lady with a camera came to us and asked if we wanted a picture.  Thinking it would be like Morton's, a complimentary picture of us in a little cardboard frame folder.  The lady came back out with a leather frame folder, about 11x13\" or so, with two of our pictures enclosed.  Granted, we didn't like how we looked in them, then she threw the price at us of $60.  Heck no!  I'm not paying that much for dinner pictures that we don't even like.  We're not obligated to buy it, but it made me feel bad because the poor lady went through all that.",

We split the aforementioned skirt steak, which I highly recommend. Other highlights include the mushroom assortment and asparagus. We ordered way too much! We would have been totally stuffed with the steak and a single side. On the upside, we had awesome leftovers the next morning.   Minus one star for the outdated decor-- the place has that tacky Vegas look that doesn't match the food quality.",

The restaurant was too dark and the decor, paintings of cows with prime rib, filet mignon, etc. written beside them in blood-red was very unappetizing and in poor taste, just like the food. I almost vowed to become a vegetarian after this ordeal of throwing money down the drain. Outback Steakhouse is a lot better than this place.",

We spoke with Matt, who reviewed the wine flights with us and was great to talk with. We had a team of four servers, Marvin being one. Marvin was great as well, and gave us the scoop on Mayweather and Alvarez, and their food choices.   First had a crisp, appley white with a stellar lobster bisque, slaw and pork belly salad, Caesar with anchovies, and baby greens with nuts and cooked peaches. Bread is a nice touch, tiny buns with course salt and clarified butter. Then we shared generous portions of the wagyu skirt  and ribeye steaks, thinly scalloped potatoes, asparagus, three types of mushrooms. The wine was a cab which complemented the meat nicely. A server topped off our wine and gave us a break before dessert... We needed one. The portions were generous all around.  Dessert was a selection of rich chocolate cake, apricot and chocolate gelato, as well as an egg-shaped vanilla bean ice cream with delish monkey bread and congratulatory sauce as we had JUST gotten engaged on our way to dinner. The wine flight alone at $35 pp was a deal. Definitely got a good value for the expense. Will be back if we return to Vegas.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I made reservations to dine here because his friend highly recommended this steak house.  Our reservation was on December 27. 2011, at 6PM.  We arrived on time and was seated promptly. The decor was simple, yet elegant.  Think lots of dark wood and spacious seating arrangements.    Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested we go with the chef's tasting menu.  For $120 per person, we were on our way to sample a trio of starters, a dual of angus steaks, a trio of side dishes, and FOUR different desserts!  The fourth dessert was added because I mentioned we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday (even though it was still days away, LOL).    For starters, we were served the cocktail prawns, warm frisee salad, and the lobster bisque.  The prawns were perfect.  My favorite starter was the salad.  It was just absolutely delicious.   For sides to accompany our steaks, we were served the mashed potatoes, mushroom assortment, and risotto.  My favorite was the mushrooms.  Our angus steaks included one ribeye and one New York strip.  Both were prepared perfectly.  As you can imagine, when dessert time rolled around, we were already pretty stuffed.  $120 per person is on the expensive side, but the chef really gives you way more than enough food.  For dessert, we were served the cinnamon monkey bread, sorbet,  farmer's market fruit plate, and a flourless chocolate cake with ice cream.  The monkey bread was my favorite.  It tasted like a gourmet cinnamon roll.  Overall, the service was superb and the food was good.  I wouldn't say it's the best steak I ever had, but as far as the tasting menu goes, it's the best value.  However, we ate only half of the food and couldn't take it back to the hotel because we were off to see Ka.",

I have always asked for the chef to cook my lamb the way he intended it to be served, given that I trust the chef with his tasted and cooking abilities, but this time, it appeared he sent it to me directly cut from the lamb's ribs, bypassing the range. I had to send it back and ask for it to be cooked, but when it returned there was very little difference. The service was mediocre, given our bill was a hefty one. The only people who busted their butts were the busboys who were at our service. I don't recommend this restaurant, but if you must, kip the lamb at all costs! My party had similar issue with their food, but I'll let them write their own comments and reviews!",

Upon arriving we were told table would be ready soon and then suggested we go to the bar.  Since restaurant was empty and waiters just standing around it appeared this was done to encourage guests to buy drinks prior to dinner. ($$$$) Once we ordered our meal, the experience improved 100%. Our waiter Joe was helpful in making suggestions.  The buttery dinner rolls were best and we consumed all 6 and were asked if we wanted more.  We shared the following dishes: Caesar salad - good/standard Braised short rib raviolis - divine Braised short ribs - a must have, fall off the bone and delicious  Brussel sprouts - the best ever with yummy bacon chunks  Ambience/decor was classy western steakhouse and although seating close together it was early in evening so not that noisy and comfortable.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I visit vegas about twice a year and we definitely come for the high quality restaurant options. After a fair amount of discussion we decided to eat at Craftsteak. We didn't have a reservation so we got sat in the cocktail area. Which was fine, it wasn't very noisy and the restaraunt is beautiful. The sommelier greeted us and helped guide us to our drinks. Their winelist is great and they have a very large selection of different alcohols. I only wish the drink menu represented that. The cocktails where very boring and the restaraunt needs to embrace the concept of craft cocktails. Paying $20 for a drink is fine. But not a simple old fashion I can easily make on my own. We ordered the short rib and the bone in ribeye, and I was interested in the Oscar style for my steak but I have to admit I was very disappointed. Not only in the bernaise but also the quality of the meat itself. The steak looked as if it was cooked perfectly. But it was surprisingly tough with little to no fat. I am still wondering if they cooked me a strip steak by mistake. The steak in total cost about $85 after adding the oscar. It was nice that they used king crab with the Oscar but again the bernaise  was light and not very impressive. The True stars to our meal were our side dishes. We ordered the potato puree and the roasted cauliflower which where both wonderful and the only saving grace of the meal, which in itself is depressing as the side dishes shouldn't be the star of a steak dinner. Overall this was a regret meal. With the competition from neighboring restaraunts I really hope this was just an off night for craftsteak and not a True example of what they have to offer. Our meal cost $250 and that was on the low side. We would have gladly ordered another drink and desert if the rest of the experience wasn't so underwhelming.",

    "text": "This review will sadly be dismissed by people scrolling through these amazing reviews. Please pay attention to the dozen or so reviews of Craftsteak saying the steaks are flavorless and not good, and the rest of the food uninspired and tasteless. When I was choosing a restaurant I was nervous about these few 1 and 2 star reviews who were dismayed at the subpar, disappointing food, but I chalked it up to random Debbie downers. I will now be a Debbie downer. Don't be fooled by the reviews of \"the rolls\"!!! Are you paying hundreds of dollars to eat bread and butter? Don't be enticed by the rolls (which are amazing). If you are here to get drunk and thoughtlessly stuff your face then I'm sure Craftsteak will suffice. But if you're a foodie who appreciates unique, delicious flavors regardless of price, and aren't here to get wasted and swoon over dinner rolls, stay away. This place gets 1 star for the delicious lobster bisque and rolls. But we didn't pay $200+ for soup and rolls. We had to send back the frisee salad. I love frisee salad. This one tasted of vinegar, and the bacon was thick and chewy instead of crispy. It tasted like some mash-up someone's Aunt would bring to a backyard picnic. It was revolting. The scallops were SO underwhelming, over cooked and rubbery yet barely any sear flavor. Bland bland bland. Zero flavor. The 10 oz filet was a big, under seasoned, flavorless hunk of meat. It had no quality to it. Just a plain, steaky-flavor and not in a good way. No interesting flavor, butter, spices, ANYTHING. Awful. I've had filets from Whole Foods, filets that are $40, and filets that are $70. This was the most disappointing gross steak of my life. The worst were the fries. We ate about 5 of them. No salt, no seasoning, no nothing. Some of the worst fries I've ever had (excluding fast food, but why would I need to say that? These were $15 fries so that shouldn't even need to be said). No ketchup, dipping sauce, chives, truffle, duck fat, spices, NOTHING....ANYTHING!!!. Had to request ketchup. We were so annoyed, underwhelmed and disappointed that we A) didn't finish our food B) didn't take anything with us and C) didn't order dessert. If this place wasn't so expensive I would still give a 1 star review. As another review said, had Tom C. eaten this food on Top Chef he would have been disgusted. And when you add in the price......good Lord. What a let down",

Although I love fine dining in general, my bucket list includes all of the great steak houses--Bern's, Gibson's, Peter Luger, etc. and I dragged my better half to Craftsteak (she's not much of a red meat eater) when we were last in Vegas. Despite what others have said, I actually really liked the atmosphere--casual and loud, with a great vibe throughout the room. We had one really odd experience in which one server introduced himself as part of a duo of servers that would help us, but we never saw him again and his partner did all the rest of the work for our table (I sure hope she got all of the tip!) That minor quibble aside, the service was excellent.   The food was generally good, but I have to agree with other reviewers--for what I paid for the meal I expected something much better than Morton's or Ruth's Chris, and what I got was much more like those chains in terms of food quality, but at about twice the price tag. The hanger steak was fine, but it was not worth the nearly $100 I paid for it, especially given that all of the side dishes ran nearly $20 each.   Overall, good food, but really not worth the expense given all of the other great choices for steak places in Vegas at more reasonable prices.",

    "text": "I try my best to eat at a new steakhouse every time I'm in Vegas. This past trip, Craftsteak was one that I had been wanting to try for awhile now.   I went here with a party of 5 and we all decided to do the chef's tasting. We ended up doing the wagyu tasting, which I believe was $140 per person. Just FYI, if one person wants to do the tasting, then everyone has to do the tasting, they won't just do it for a few people in your party. It's just because of the way they serve it, family style. But i think the tasting menu is the way to go because you get to try so many things!  First off, the service was absolutely amazing. We had two waitresses, but then other waiters/waitresses would come by to check on us as well. Everyone was great and very friendly which is a huge plus for me.  We decided to go for the wine pairing because it was easier then trying to find some decent bottles of wine that everyone could agree on. It came with three wines, a chardonnay I think from nickel nickel, a cab from Jordan winery, and then some kind of dessert wine. I'm not usually a fan of white wine, but it did pair well with the first course.   First course was all appetizers. I honestly can't remember everything they brought out but there were 5 or 6 appetizers in total that came out and they were all delicious.   Second course was the meat and sides. I know one of the sides was mashed potatoes, the other one was carrots, we had peas with hot sauce, and asparagus. I didn't try the peas because hot sauce of peas just didn't sound appealing to me, but according to the other people in the party, it was good. I always make the mistake of filing up on mashed potatoes because that is my favorite side of all time, and this time was no exception.   They literally give you 5 or 6 cuts of meat! It is heaven. Here is the mistake we made and you should definitely try to avoid this if you like your meat medium rare/rare: since the meat comes in cask iron skillets, take out all of the pieces of meat and put them on your regular plates. What happened was that we left the steak in the skillets (rookie mistake, I know) and by the time we got to the last few cuts, it was well done. So the first few cuts we had were absolutely amazing, however, as we got to the better cuts (we saved best for last) they were overcooked :( All in all, still a very good meal.   Just when you think you're going to explode, dessert comes out. You seriously want to save room because it is quite the spread. Any dessert you're craving, they will have it. I seriously think they brought out 8 desserts for the 5 of us. They were all spectacular.   This place is definitely worth the money but just know that it is not going to be a cheap meal, so save your pennies or walk away from that blackjack table while you're ahead!",

    "text": "You tend to not want to buy in to restaurants that have celebrity chef hype but man, the food from Craftsteak is hands down one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth.   I was fortunate enough to attend a private brunch here for the Vegas Uncorked events. Having never been to Craftsteak, combined with the mass feeding of 200 people, you always go in with reservations that you're going to get food that has been churned out with the quality of mass production. Not the case here.   We were served a 3 course brunch with 5 dishes per course. The more the food came out, the better it kept getting. Every other word out of my mouth was \"wow\" or \"holy sh*t this is good\". Ok the latter was in my head. Among the notables, braised pork belly that melted in your mouth and the wagyu skirt steak in salsa verde that was cooked to perfection. I am a carnivore at heart and wow, those were seriously some of the best pieces of meat in my life. The food is simple too, nothing too overtly gourmet and complicated. Simple food, tons of flavor and noticeable quality.   If this is the kind of food they serve at an event I fear how awesome it would be on a regular night when you're getting something made to order.   The service was impeccable. If you got up to go to the restroom you came back to your napkin being refolded in your spot. It's details like that that set a place apart. I want my dining to be an experience, to be memorable. Craftsteak delivered that and more. The decor is swank, dark and well designed. Ambiance to the light of Edison bulbs? Combine that with amazing food and you got a win win situation.   I really like what Tom Colicchio has done with this place, it is truly one of best places to eat in Las Vegas. Hands down. And well, sometimes celebrity chefs deserve the hype, he is one of them.",

I was lucky enough to try several things on the menu because it was served family style.  It is a very traditional steak house, with an impeccable attention to detail.  3 items that I will remember were the flat iron beef, which had a great flavor and perfect char.  Our potato puree was a great accompaniment.  Very rich and creamy.  For dessert, the sorbet was awesome.  All ice cream flavors were delicious and unique.  I would put this restaurant in my Top 10 Steakhouses for sure.  There were no famous TV chef sightings ;-)  Property - 4 stars Staff - 5 stars Ambience - 4 stars Food - 4 stars Price - 4 stars",

The only thing that didn't come through was the dessert.  We ordered 6 scoops of sorbet/ice cream.  One of the flavors was mango/passionfruit and it was unbearably sour and in my opinion inedible.  The dessert should be be spot on as this is your last chance to make a great impression.  Unfortunately it left a sour taste in our mouths.  And when we notified the waiter, he didn't really apologize or ask if we'd like another flavor.  Other than that, it was an amazing dining experience!",

Yes my expectations were high and the steak did live up to them!  The fillet Mignon was amazing, the oysters were fresh, the side dishes were all very tasty and a perfect compliment to the steak.    The portions were very generous but not overly huge, too bad I can't say that for the price tag, it was an expensive dinner and being a San Franciscan, I know we can have amazing food in they city for much less, but I never order steak because most places can't really prepare it right.  We accepted that everything in Vegas is over the top.    The restaurant is very elegant but simple at the same time, and the diners are dressed up and there to enjoy a nice relaxing meal.  The service could have been better, the service was slow and our waiter didn't give us quite the attention we needed.  But overall we were very pleased and I would try the NY location.",

Once we were seated and ordered, food came on pretty fast. The salad, Warm Frisee, was delicious. The poached egg mixed well with the mixed green and the bacon was good. The salad was also pretty decent sized, so you could share it with someone else if you have a 3-course meal. The porterhouse steak came up and I will admit I was underwhelmed. I may have been expecting something like a Peter Lugers where the steak has been clearly aged. Don't get me the wrong, the steak was good, but it wasn't memorable. The bone marrow that came with it was also pretty oily. We also ordered a side of brussel sprouts, which was one of the specials of the day and it was very flavorful.",

My beet salad had too many, esthetically pleasing, flavorless beets. My steak was not hot and my girlfriends was overcooked. (rare came out medium..) All the meat felt like it had been waiting too long to be served and the sides were also limp and only average. The service was slow and didnt have the professional touch I enjoy at other steakhouses. Maybe because we were seated at ten pm but its Vegas and at $125 per person for a table of 6 they could have treated us better! When the tip is included why does the service always suck?? We all agreed the food court would have made more sense..",

Disappointing, but I still ate it cuz I was starving. For side dishes, we got a few to share. The star side dish, hands down, was the Maui Onions. Those things just MELTED in your mouth. They were soooooo freaking good that when the waitress came back, we ordered more Maui Onions. I don't think I've ever had onions taste as sweet or as juicy. Just melts.

    "text": "This popular Las Vegas steakhouse doesn't need one more 5-star rating, but here goes.  I decided to keep things simple, as it had been a long day attending a financial software conference.  I decided on some iteration of a green salad, filet mignon, and a chocolate dessert.    All of these delivered beyond my expectations, and I only wish there was a Craftsteak closer to my home in Florida, so I could visit on a semi-frequent basis.  The spinach salad with pears, called 'Market Spinach, Pears, Port Wine' on the menu, was simple and generous.  The pears had a bit of a chew and the port dressing wasn't boozy at all.  The filet mignon, a 10 oz. Blank Angus under the 'Roasted' section, was prepared to perfection.  It was prepared the way I would do it at home:  butterflied, one side crusted with crushed peppercorns and coarse salt, pan seared, and then finished (most likely) in the oven.  The accompanying pan sauce -- not listed or described on the menu -- was rich and savory (I actually wished there was a bit more).  Finally, choosing a suitable dessert wasn't difficult:  the Chocolate Souffle with Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream was the very center selection listed on the Dessert menu.  I have made dozens of chocolate souffles at home, and I was curious how Craftsteak was going to pull it off.  Was it going to be crusty, like a hot, just-baked chocolate cake?  Or was it going to be soupy, like a hot pudding? Well, my Yelp friends, it was a flawless combination of both:  a hot, spongy, fully-baked moist soft chocolate cake that was served perfectly cylindrical and tower-like.  I Instagrammed a photo and posted it here.    The scoop of homemade, white chocolate chip mint ice cream looked like a hard-boiled egg on the plate, but don't let that distract you -- homemade ice cream is always a treat.    In closing, the service was flawless.  My server that night was named Alexis, who I learned not only holds 11+ years of experience with the restaurant, but also grew up near me in central New Jersey. In fact, we attended rival high schools, but that didn't matter:  at Craftsteak, we were passionate allies in search of a perfect meal.",

    "text": "This was one of the highlights of my 3 day weekend getaway to Vegas.   I really wanted to do the tasting menu but my boyfriend pointed out that it would be a little bit more cost effective to just order a la carte off the menu and we still had a ton of food.   The tasting menu is $125 a person if you get the double ranch steak or $155 if you get the wagyu beef. It offers a appetizer (soup or 4 oysters or shrimp cocktail), 3 small salads, 3 sides, and 3 desserts.   Started off the italian buffalo mozzarella for $17.00. It was basically a 6 slices of Mozzarella topped with this tomato relish and balsamic and olive oil. The highlight was the toasted hazelnuts. Nothing super special about this salad but it was good  We decided to order the porterhouse for 2 for $98.00. It was a huge 32 oz steak that was cooked perfectly medium rare. I hate when restaurants cooked their steak medium rare and it comes out dripping in blood, but Craftsteak does it well where the meat is medium rare but not bloody.   Sides: We went all out and tried the corn- $15.00, potato puree- $14.00, mushroom assortment- $25.00, and baby squash- $15.00.   Corn- sweet corn sauteed in butter. The corn was crunchy and tasted very fresh Potato puree- it's like mashed potatoes but very different. The potatoes are very thick and gooey and have such the right amount of butter and cream Mushroom assortment- shittake, french horn, hen of the woods, and white beech. Sauteed so that the mushrooms still had some texture  Baby squash- the least favorite of my sides. It was small italian squash over a really good chunky marinara sauce. I believe the squash was roasted.Not anything super special.   Dessert: Got the $14.00 cinnamon pull apart monkey bread. It's basically chunks of broiche with pecans and caramel with a side of cinnamon ice cream. It was really rich but not overly sweet, which was surprising because the whole bread had alot of caramel sauce over it.   Service: We had 3 different waiters, the main waiter, water boy, and a plate person. Service was exceptional and they give you warm plates after every course as well as new utensils. Denise the manager also went above and beyond to make it a Truely memorable dining experience and gave us a booth too.   Tip: If you want a nice romantic seating ask for a booth. It's alot more private.   Come back again? For sure!",

We dined at Tom Colicchio's Steakhouse on New Years Eve and we will not be back.   We had 5 pm reservations, right when the restaurant opens. Checked in about 6 minutes prior to that and then stood and waited for almost 20 minutes while tables that checked in after us were seated before us. Finally I went to the hostess stand to make sure they checked us in and was smugly informed that \"oh you were\" and \" you'll be next.\" I shook it off, it was still going to be a great meal, right?  I will say we had a great table, and the ambiance was really nice. Our server brought us a wine menu, which we declined because neither of us drink wine. Our server then proceeded to try to convince us to order drinks. When we did not order more than iced tea, he walked off in almost a huff. We were met by a new server about 10 minutes later.  I guess we were not worth the first one's time...  As for the food, the clams and the brussel sprouts were good. Not the best I've had by any means, but good. The salad was hard to eat (lettuce was left whole with the ribs and all so you needed a knife to break it apart). Both of our steaks and potatoes were dry, dry, dry. Almost inedible.  My feeling is that we were snubbed because we are in our late 20s while the rest of the clientele was in their 40s-50s. They did not think we were going to spend money so they gave us crappy service and crappy food. I could be wrong.",

The thought crosses my mind, \"Yeah, I can totally do that for dinner.\" My eyes like to wonder around a place to check out the eccentricities, and I notice that  they literally have hundreds of bottles of wine stashed all around the entire room. They've won me over already.  Their dinner rolls are light, fluffy, savory, and are topped with glazed butter and probably ground sea salt. Honestly, they remind me of my great grandmother's homemade recipe which I haven't eaten in nearly 20 years. So whiskey heaven, and a time warp to home cooking.......yep, I'm loving it.  Medium rare grilled New York Strip comes out lightly seasoned, cooked to perfection. I'd also ordered a couple of sides consisting of au gratin potatoes and grilled, sliced carrots. I couldn't have asked for anything more.   After working my way through the sea of food, I cannot possibly eat anymore, and they were quick to box it up for me with everything individually separated to not spoil or comingle the flavors.   Over the top? Absolutely not. Great, high end steak restaurant? YES. I would have no hesitation going back.  Check it out for yourself, and I'm certain you'll not be disappointed.",

Came here with a party of ten; after dinner, nine of the ten went to the bar and ordered drinks, and the bartender told the woman with the Chinese accent that she had to go sit somewhere else while others could stay at the bar and order drinks. Great food but the guy at the bar sucked and was pretty offensive about singling her out. We were all frequent customers but probably won't ever come back after tonight.",

    "text": "We've been here a handful of times but hadn't returned for about 2 years because the host service was awful.  Even with reservations the host made us wait over an hour and kept saying, \"it will just be 15 more minutes.\"  Because of this, we were hesitant to return but thankfully on this visit we were seated right away and had no problems.    As always, the food was amazing.  People always complain about the price but I think if you want quality food, you have to pay for it, and in Vegas everything in expensive. There is a Chef's Selection Menu for a set price per person and this gives you a certain amount of starters, entrees, and desserts but I'm glad the four of us did not choose this option because it would have been far too much food.  Two of us started with lobster bisque which was absolutely fantastic, we all ordered a steak, and then we all shared 2 sides which were large.  Then we each ordered a dessert.  My sister-in-law and I both ordered the monkey bread because we didn't want to share the amazingness. You must try it!  It's the best dessert in the world. The husbands each had two scoops of very good ice cream.  Afterward we were so stuffed!  Service was great and I look forward to returning.",

We had a reservation and ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes for our table. That drives me crazy and is usually a bad sign.  It took a while to get our wine and place our order. I really don't feel that it was that busy. Here is a list of the items ordered:  Apps: Calamari Chorizo, Polenta, Arugula, Hand-cut Wagyu Tartare* Crostini  Salad: Italian Buffalo Mozzarella Hazelnuts, Warm Frisee* Farm Egg, Smoked Bacon  Entrees: 8 oz. New York Strip, Japan, 24 hour Shortrib Cipollini Onion  Sides: Braised Kale Bacon, White Beans, Bordelaise, Potato Gratin Roasted Garlic Cream  Desserts: Peanut Butter Mousse and Clemence Pie  It took a wile to get our food and the food was just okay. Nothing stood out at me as amazing. I was expecting a lot more from this place.   My second visit was just for drinks. I was happy to just get to the bar. I ordered the Key Lime Martini and Cucumber Gin Martini. Both were really good and I would definitely return back for drinks, food probably not.",

They recently added an option to their menu that they used to just have for large parties where it's about $120-ish a person and you get soup, 3 salads to share, a steak, I believe 1-2 sides per person, and dessert. Overall, it is a good deal for all you're getting....but we saw others get it and it's A LOT of food for one person. We decided against it due to the sheer volume of food and we knew we wanted to go out after and drink....and all that food would have been a bad idea.  I got the ribeye and he got the NY strip. We got 3 sides to share--the mashed potatoes, risotto, and brussel sprouts. Everything was AMAZING and honestly, 3 sides was still too much. They serve you these amazing, buttery rolls before dinner and we made the mistake of getting seconds....and they filled us up big time! We had 2 cocktails each and altogether, the bill was just over $200. So again, definitely a pricy meal, but if it's a special occasion, it's totally worth the one time a year splurge.",

The wife and I went with the 3 course wagyu beef taste menu and the portion size was unreal, but trust me you'll find room for everything! Haha..All in all there were no complaints at all about anything so hence the 5 stars..I can't say I've ever been able to say that about a meal before!  We started with being overloaded with appetizers, but believe me that is an awesome understatement..I don't remember the names exactly, but we did have prosciutto paired with a pear which blew my mind, 2 salads one which was spinach and the other had an egg and bacon mixed in which again left me seeing stars! That was partnered with some strip and cocktail sauce which made me want to lick the bowl clean.   The main course and best course, MEATPALOOZA! We had selected the filet mignon and on recommendation of our waitress the skirt steak..They do NOT leave you hungry here at all..We had what felt like 50 cows in front of us, but it was the most tender steak I'd have ever encountered and the flavoring was a mardi gras in your mouth (oh yes that's surely a good thing in this instance)..It was paired with asparagus which was prepared to perfection, mashed potatoes which were not heavy in any right!  At this point my eyes were popping out, but as I said once they lay the dessert down you FIND ROOM BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY..We had the most delectable vanilla bean cheesecake ever, the ever famous and good in the hood monkey bread, and a sample of strawberry/chocolate sorbet..With it being our anniversary they even wrote in chocolate a congratulatory message which certainly shows that they care just that extra above the rest!  We did piece together why their menu isn't listed anywhere and this by far to me was the big brownie point..They serve what is currently in season so the menu is ever changing..I know Las Vegas is a town for change, but some things remain as they are..I'm happy to know if I come back in 6 months the review would be different..They make Tom proud at the very least I'm sure!  Our bill total was about $394, but honestly for the amount of food we had for the both of us and the amount of value we were shown each bite chewed along with every penny paid made the meal worth every bit of that outing!",

This was on our list of can't-miss restaurants, and I think that overall, they lived up to our expectations.   We each ordered the same steak entree, each of which was prepared to our preferred level of doneness, which is to be expected at a steakhouse of this caliber. Side dishes were delightful- we shared the white corn grits and the heirloom cauliflower with garlic confit. The staff also kept us well stocked on fresh-baked yeast rolls, which were jaw-droppingly good.  Cocktails were yummy, but not extraordinary. Atmosphere was lovely and conducive to conversation. My only complaint is that our server did not tell us that sides were family-sized, and so our party ended up over ordering a bit compared to what we would have if we'd been better informed of portions.   Overall, we had a great time and would recommend Craftsteak to others.",

They were pushing us on California wines and some of the prices scared me (and probably would scare the accountants in my company too).   Instead, I went with the cheaper option of Riojo wine from Spain at a relatively cheaper price level around $80 per bottle.    I had the beef rib and it came in a small pot.  The taste / sauce was good but the meat was a bit too dry - even in the \"fatty\" portion of the cut.   I should have stuck to my regular favorites - as I prefer \"fatter\" cuts like Ribeye or Prime Ribs.      The sides that we ordered were good and went nicely with the meat.    Now, I am waiting for my accounting department to beat me up on a pretty steep final check as we had too many bottles of those \"cheap\" wines at dinner.",

    "text": "This place was amazing. Located inside the MGM Grand Casino on the the strip, i was curious to try out Craftsteak I'd heard so much about. The restaurant is located in The District part of the casino by a couple other restaurants and a Starbucks. I don't eat red meat or pork, but my husband and his friend had eaten here a couple times before and promised they had chicken and seafood options I'd love.  The ambiance inside is this rustic, kind of western meets slightly modern decor, with square buckskin coveted lighting overhead, lots of tanned leather seating and dark wood tables. The bar has everything you'd need to make a cocktail of your choosing.  We were seated right away since it was 7pm on a Tuesday, and menus brought to our table. They have very high end meat cuts, scallops, mussels, lobster, tartare, free range chicken, etc.  we ordered Cesar  Salad (minus the anchovies on top) and a delicious roasted red pepper/garlic salad was amazing! The lobster bisque is their staple soup, garlicky-butter bread rolls are brought to the table, it starts off very nicely. Food for dinner, scallops in a fennel sauce (amazing, I don't like fennel and was a bit apprehensive, but it's very mild and very light), French fries with smoked paprika, morel mushrooms, grilled asparagus, hanger steak and flatiron steak, everything was outstanding. We shared a cinnamon monkeybread (melt in your mouth buttery, cinnamon pecan bread) with banana flavored ice cream, a splendid finale to a great dinner. (Oh, and I got a single scoop of the raspberry-ginger sorbet, I'd come back just for that, it was light and had the perfect blend of fruity-spice, heaven!) Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak is a little pricey, but the food was fantastic. (Total bill, food mentioned above and 3 cocktails was $235 without tip). Service was top notch, too, our server was extremely gracious and accommodating.",

We were seated right away with Opentable resos and checked out the really warm, wood-filled decor on the way to our table. We were seated and told we had 2 servers because 1 was in training. Ok, cool. We had the complimentary bread (the best part of everything), bottle of wine, lobster bisque, salmon for me and ribeye for him. Service was a little odd, again with 2 servers. It seemed like they didn't communicate well and didn't know if we ordered something or the tables near us. It also took forever and a day to get our meals.   The lobster bisque was as cold as Chicago in February and this was no gazpacho. My fish was good but the veggies paired with it were crazy bitter. I don't understand why they'd pair these together. Hubby loved his steak and said it was a game changer since he never orders rib-eyes. They gave us little rich chocolate squares for celebrating our anniversary and brought the bill.  Idk if they were trying to be slick or a genuine error, but they charged us one of the most expensive wine bottles in place of the regularly priced one we ordered. We had to wait quite a while for this to be corrected, since the server in training didn't have authority or whatever to correct the issue. It was fixed but just left an even more bitter taste after all those bitter greens.   I was hoping TM's would blow me away but it was just ok.",

    "text": "This place is pretty great. Me and my gf came on a weekday and it was maybe half full. The tar tar was awesome, that's something we usually get at most steakhouses. I actually really enjoyed the Caesar salad with the white anchovy. I am a big Caesar salad fan and this was a good one. We got the porterhouse for 2 and Yukon gold mash. Mash was silky smooth but I think just had a tiny bit too much butter in it. The steak was very good quality, even though could of been a tiny bit more flavor and salt, but if you dip it in the pan sauce it's perfect. I do like my steak with a crust on it, but that's just me..I think it would of been a bit better with a crust. Good dessert, peanut butter chocolate lava cake. Overall A very good meal. Excellent service.",

It's tough to find a restaurant that can cook a steak the way I want it (still cold in the middle), but the waiter didn't blink twice when I ordered it that way. I get the rib-eye because it's the fatties and the tastiest. I don't drink in there because I'm not King Midas, But I'm willing to shell out some clams every once in a while for a good steak and service. It's like a 3 hour vacation. The desserts are good also.",

    "text": "Came here for our 16th wedding Anniversary.. we usually go to Ruth's Chris but we were in Vegas where we were married,  and decided to try something different. This place was recommended by a friend, and we figured we'd splurged a little.   AMBIANCE: Very nice, and romantic.  SERVICE: Great, our waiter was very nice and attentive.. however...I asked for a copy of the menu, which they print new everyday with the date so I could keep as a momento,  he promised to roll one up for me and give it to me before we left,  which he forgot... THE FOOD: we both ordered our usual The Ribeye, my husband ordered med.  And I ordered med to ALMOST well (don't like my steak bloody OR dry)... well i got an over done dried out hockey puck!  For $60 a steak I expected perfection... right?  So our waiter came and checked in a few minutes later, and I showed him my steak.. he was apologetic and took it back right away for a new one,  he asked again how I'd like it cooked, I asked for the same thing as the 1st time, he replied, \"So Medium plus?\"  I said ok,  as long as its not bloody and not over cooked and dry.  He brings out the new steak,  I cut a piece, put it on my plate,  cut it in half,  and there's a pool of blood on my plate, I gagged...he came checked in and immediately saw it was wrong,  apologized again and asked to take it back and get a little more cook on it.  By this time,  my husband was 2/3 done with his steak,  I was filling up on the yummy delicious bread  (which unfortunately was the best part of the meal) we also ordered the sauteed spinach, very bland and was cold in 2 minutes,  and also the potato puree, it was ok, a little bland but great consistency.  So he brings my steak back,  and stood I front of me while I cut into it to make sure it was ok, I figured, I was just going to deal with whatever it was at this point,  I was just over it, which I said to him.  He told me he was so sorry that our dinner was ruined, I ate 1/4 of the steak, it just wasn't good. He came back and told us he would take it off the bill.  That didn't make all better but it helped..a LITTLE.   DESSERT:  They BROUGHT US MENUS TO ORDER DESERT!  HELLO!?  After spending $250 minus $60 for the steak,  you're not even going to bring out a gifted dessert with Happy Anniversary written on it??  They do this at Ruth's Chris with CHAMPAGNE!!  As well as MANY other restaurants.  Anyway,  we said no thank you to desert... guess what they brought out afterwards.....a little plate with 2 little peanut butter cookies that said happy anniversary...  We looked at each other and laughed shockingly...I felt embarrassed what a way to add to a completely under par experience.",

The salmon was atrocious. It said there was an olive relish on it but it came out totally plain and unseasoned. I asked about it and they said there were olives in the broth. I seriously doubt that since there was no broth. Also, after I asked, they ignored us for the remainder of the meal. Not worth the money.",

My group had 11 and tried a wide variety of dishes, and some we're very happy with their meals. For myself, I ordered the grilled Angus bone-in ribeye, and was underwhelmed. Even after picking through the considerable gristle, the flavor just didn't hit as hard as I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. As for sides, the corn, potato puree, and spinach were fine, but the asparagus was bitter. Monkey bread and sorbet for dessert hit the right spot, but I'd still recommend saving your $180 or so for something else.",

The portions were great - loved the lobster and crab.  I didn't eat any oysters, but my colleagues said they were good.    For dinner, I had the 10 ounce filet mignon.  It was cooked perfectly - melt in your mouth - and seasoned just right.  My colleagues had a mixture of entrees - salmon with lemon basil pesto, New York strip, Ribeye - and everybody said their entree was delicious.  We shared different side dishes including asparagus, baby spinach, hen of the woods mushrooms, snap peas, potato puree and white corn grits.  The snap peas were great - lightly sauced with a little kick.  The white corn grits with bacon, cheese and chives was quite delicious as well.  I also enjoyed the spinach which is lightly cooked in garlic and olive oil.    For dessert, we shared a selection including monkey bread, chocolate cake, vanilla cheesecake, and a selection of ice cream and sorbet.  The monkey bread is delicious - has a great cinnamon flavor and love the pecan toffee sauce.  The chocolate cake is quite delicious - melt in your mouse.    Kevin was our server - amazing service and kept us laughing as well.  If I return, I would definitely love to ask for Kevin.",

    "text": "This is a really tough review for me because I'm not exactly sure how I want to rate it. I am a huge fan of Tom Colicchio and I came here as a gift from someone. I point that out because I would never spend so much money on a restaurant.   I ordered the domestic Wagyu Skirt Steak, as it was recommended to me. I found it to be tasty but not for that price. The Hen of the Woods mushrooms were good but nothing super memorable while the potato puree was really rich and just okay. We also had scallops that didn't quite live up to others I've had in recent months. My point is that I understand you are paying for the name and location but neither, in my mind, justify the steep prices. If I'm paying this much, I should walk out thinking this would be my last meal on earth and this one didn't even rank in the top 10 while this was number one on the money spent.  What I will say is that the service was second to none. In fact, I'm not sure I've ever had such outstanding service at a restaurant. It was perfect- not overbearing but attentive and excellent recommendations. I just can't say enough.  I liked the ambiance. It really worked well for this place and was in line with my expectations. It made for a great date spot.  When it's all said and done, if you are willing to spend all this money then go for it. I think there are better options for steak in Vegas and when I factor in what I thought about the food compared to the price, this place is nothing more than a 3.5 star rating.",

My husband and I decided to do the Double R Beef Chef's Selection which is $125 per person. Everything is pricey, but this is Vegas so we said eff it!!! They ask for any food allergies, and the rest is a surprise which I absolutely loved! You could also order items a la carte, but you wouldn't get to try as much as you would via the Chef's Selection route.  Our first course included: - Hand Cut Wagyu Tartare (DELICIOUS!!!) - Warm Frisee Salad (How have I never had this before??? WTF?!?!) - Arugula Salad - Shrimp Cocktail  Second course included: - Medium Rare N.Y. Strip - Rare as hell Filet Mignon (HOLY HELL! BOMB.) - Asparagus - Brussel Sprouts - Potato Puree (I just want to drink this for the rest of my life.)  Third course means dessert: - Cinnamon Monkey Bread - Brown Butter Carrot Cake with Maple Ice Cream (AMAZING!!!) - Farmer's Market Fruit - Sorbet selection  We enjoyed some delicious wine and beer throughout our meal. Our waiter, whose name I am sad to have forgotten, was spectacular. He was attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. As I previously mentioned, this place is not cheap, so do not go in with the intention of a quick and cheap meal. The food and dining experience is so incredibly worth the money, that I have one simple piece of advice to give... TREAT YO'SELF!!!",

    "text": "Highly dissapointed! Ordered flat bottled water, server came and filled up our glasses with tap. Order a bottle of wine, lobster bisque and the large 44oz ribeye for two. Wine came, all was good! lobster bisque came, it was good... then came the wait and wait and wait. We watched three tables that came in after us get they're food, we looked for our waiter and couldn't find him. We finished our bottle of wine which typically lasts us through our meal, still no steak. Finally, I had to nearly jump in the way of any server that walked by so I could get they're attention, and informed them that we would like our bill. The Manager arrived at our table and said the steak should be out shortly, (still our waiter was MIA!) I informed the manager that we had been there an hour and a half, she proceeded to tell me the 44oz takes a long time to cook (guess she assumed I had never has a 44oz Ribeye from any other restaurant and thought the excuse made sense in her head) I informed her that we were no longer waiting, she was polite and suggested that she would take care of the bill, I informed her that I wanted to pay for what we consumed, the wine and lobster bisque. She again, politely suggested that she take care of the charges, I again insisted that I pay the bill (I'm a business owner, and maybe I deal with too many people who complain just so they get something for free, I never want to risk coming across that way). She proceeded to go get the bill, 10 minutes later I got it! Signed it and even left a $30 tip, which I instructed her was for the bus boy who was busting his ass and not the waiter that was still missing in action.  Bottom line, obviously I lot of people have been satisfied with the restaurant, as a frequent Vegas traveler I have never experienced such poor service. You can maybe excuse it as a bad day, how-ever I feel a restaurant of this caliber needs checks and balances to assure these events don't happen. I won't be back, too many great steakhouses in Vegas.  Yelp really should come up with a rating guideline. Everyone, has different scales which renders so many reviews useless. I see people who give a business a 1 or 2 star rating yet keep returning... are they just trying to get something for free?  Here is my standards for my ratings so you can better judge my reviews and how I rate.  5 Star = Business performed as expected! I will recommend to friends and I WILL RETURN 4 Star = Was happy, but there was room for improvement. I WILL RETURN 3 Star = Needs improvement, most likely I WILL NOT RETURN. 2 Star = Way underperformed to the point I WILL NOT RETURN. 1 Star = Seriously, how is this place in business? I WILL NOT RETURN.",

    "text": "Best service in Vegas!  This review is LONG overdue.  My husband and I made a trip to LV in October of 2012 and we made advance reservations at several restaurants we wanted to try.  One of these was Crafsteak.  We made the reservation on Open Table, and noted in the comments that my husband has a food allergy.    We arrived about 10 minutes early and we were seated immediately by a very warm hostess.  The place has a surprisingly laid back ambiance and the booths are HUGE and very comfortable.  When our waitress came to the table she immediately indicated that she was aware someone at the table had a food allergy and that she would gladly accommodate and make sure the kitchen was aware as well.  I wish I had written this review sooner so that maybe I could remember her name, but she was an excellent waitress.  Extremely attentive and knowledgeable, and incredibly kind.  We decided to have the Domestic Wagyu Surf & Turf 3-course menu, along with the wine pairings.  With this menu you have no idea what you will get for each course, it is the chef's selection.  The food was AMAZING!  We got the wagyu tartare and a tomato salad for the appetizer course.  The tartare was perfectly salty and delicious! For the main course we got several cuts of steak, a lobster tail, and a variety of side dishes, including the mushroom assortment and french fries.  The lobster was tender and sweet, cooked to perfection.  The steaks melted in your mouth, were super flavorful, and were cooked exactly medium-rare, as we ordered them.  For dessert we got an assortment of house-made sorbets, as well as the cinnamon monkey bread.  The monkey bread was meant only for me as my husband could not eat it, so the sorbets were meant for him (but of course I tried the sorbets as well).  The sorbets were perfectly tart and refreshing.  The monkey bread was very tasty, just a little too sweet for my liking.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so sadly I could only take a couple of bites, but if sweets are your thing, give it a shot.  I cannot rave enough about the quality of the food and the service at Crafsteak!  My husband still dreams about that lobster tail, and he tells anyone on their way to LV that they have to eat there.    My only complaint (if I must write one), is that the amount of food that comes with the 3-course menu is just too much for 2 people.  It's impossible to finish it all, and some of the items just wouldn't be good reheated.  We made sure to finish our favorites and had them pack up the items we could reheat, but still left a good amount of food on the table, which felt wasteful.  Keep in mind they are bringing out full portions of every item, including multiple steaks and sides.  I suppose that makes it worth the money, but if it were more like a tasting menu (smaller portions) it would be perfect.  Last comment (I promise!)... save your pennies because it's definitely on the pricey side, but you are absolutely getting what you pay for.  It's worth every cent!",

I tried other peoples foods and they weren't as good as mine, so my sore is based off on all of the foods I tryed. but if it was just off mine it would be a 5 for taste.  I went with a group of friends and the wait time was garbage. From the time that we ordered about 6:15. we didnt see any of our foods until 730. I dont see how that made any sense. we asked for the food to come as it was ready, and I am sure it wasn't just because they waited before the food all didnt come at the same time.  I try some of the other peoples steak and they were really tender, one of my friends had to send it back, but once it came back the texture was great, but the flavor was a bit lacking. Dinner ended up being about a 100 each for a place, shared sides and one drink.  The ambiance was a nicer setting but not a service like sage, and a little bit too dim/dull for my likings, I almost wish It was either a full service restaurant or mroe of a fun party place, since well it is vegas.  I think the fact our food took so long took away from he experience, after a long day of work we all just wanted to play,  I would come back if a group wanted to go again but doesn't exactly scream for me to come in and eat.....",

I am enamored with this place more than I was with my first boyfriend.  Now that I'm living on the East coast, it is my best long distance relationship to date.   The food is superb. The lobster was well done, the local mushrooms were an all star, the kumamoto oysters are now my standard for great oyster experience and everything since has simply not lived up to those little guys with huge flavor, the steak is ever a specialty, but the desert-- oh that dessert-- it took my breath away.  For our anniversary they brought out a plate that was fan-f-ing-tas-tic.  Monkey bread with a pecan toffee and brown butter banana ice cream. Paired with a luscious Muscat I left more enchanted than ever.   I love, love, love Craftsteak. Thank you Tom!",

    "text": "I recently had a chance to visit this restaurant. I went in with such high expectations. I left about $250 lighter in the wallet and not truly satisfied.  The service is exquisite. You will be amazed that the people serving your meal can so consistently pamper you. They are truly professional.  No complaint here.  The beef. This is a steakhouse. It was expected they would have some high quality beef. The selection sounds good on the menu. I had a \"kobe-style\" skirt steak. It was $69. It was not as good as the $50 ribeye. Both had too much sauce, covering the delicious flavor of beef.  But the tragedy here, is the side dishes. They are each over $25. I had au gratin potatoes that were undercooked. I had some carrots that were horribly prepared, looked like extruded poop and had a horrible flavor. They were scorched in a few places and all were a dark brown or olive green color.  What makes me mad about this place is when I see Tom Colicchio berating people on Top Chef. I'd like to see him sit and eat the nasty $28 carrots. Then, I'd like to hear his dissatisfaction with au gratin potatoes that crunch. Perhaps instead of acting like a superior d-bag on TV, he should take a minute to clean up the mess back home.  Dessert was not spectacular.  The beef tartare appetizer was amazing, and I would highly recommend it. Just ask them to provide the onions and chives on the side. There must have been a 1/4 cup of them in the bowl.",

The steak was so lean and tender and the risotto was so creamy and delicious that I didn't want to share. The steak was cooked medium and showed up in a small dutch pan with the risotto in a small pot. The steak was so well cooked and seasoned and the mushrooms in the risotto were cooked crisp. I absolutely loved everything. The restaurant is rad. About 300 low watt light bulbs hung from the ceiling and gave the place a low, warm, amber glow. The staff was extremely pleasant and very helpful/knowledgeable. I would definitely eat here again. The price is a little bit high, the steak was about $35, but it was completely worth it.   This restaurant should be a model to every single restaurant in the country. It should show that food can be cooked very well. Let me tell you, many restaurants could hugely benefit from that lesson.   Everybody should give this place a try at least once in their lives. Treat yourself once to a meal that you will not forget.",

    "text": "\"I was 32 when I started cooking; up until then, I just ate.\" - Julia Child  \"Great food is like great sex.  The more you have the more you want.\" - Gael Greene   Do you remember the last moment in your life that brought you great joy? That awesome Christmas present? The raise at work? The new car?  Now think about it, what was the last MEAL that brought you great joy?  Mine was Craftsteak.  I had the pleasure of dining with three of my closest friends, whom I introduced the thought of Craftsteak to. I had only heard and read about their signature plate, the Japanese Grill Kobe Wagyu Skirt Steak. Today was the day I found out truly what was in store for me.   As we toured the menu, it was thought that we were going to order A'la Carte. But in my mind I knew better than that and decided to simply ask, \"What do you recommend we do?\" They suggested that the four of us partake in the Grade 7 Surf and Turf. It was to be a feast that we would not regret.   It would take forever to describe each dish, but to have an idea of what to expect:  First Course: Parker House Rolls with Flaked Sea Salt and salted butter; Persian Cucumber, Watercress, and Ginger salad; Heirloom Tomatoes with Olive Oil and Basil; Wagyu Beef Tartare with Crostini; Pacific Blue Prawns (a la plancha).  Favorite Starter - Wagyu Beef Tartare. The wagyu beef tartare was phenomenal. The seasoning had the right amount of saltiness, and the beef's texture was not fatty or mushy, but soft and delicate. Paired with the crunchiness of the hot crostinis, I would go back just to order this alone. Truly fabulous.  Main Course: \"Black label\" Grade 7 Wagyu Beef Filet Mignon, Ribeye, and Skirt Steak; Lobster in saffron butter, grilled asparagus with lemon and thyme, roasted fingerling potatoes with rosemary, assorted mushrooms (hen of the woods, organic baby shiitake, white shimeji, and golden chanterelle).  Favorite Entree - Wagyu Skirt Steak. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned and it absolutely explodes flavor into your mouth. Was the ribeye good? Yes, and so was the filet. But those two steaks paled in comparison that the skirt offers. You are doing yourself a disservice if you come here and you don't eat this.   Favorite side - Mushrooms - They complimented the steaks beautifully and the assortment was superb. They were not soggy or overcooked and were a perfect side to the steaks. I do hope on trying the Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes next time I am there.  Dessert: Sorbet sampler (concord grape, apple cider, melon, and asian pear); Cinnamon monkey bread with pecan toffee and cajeta ice cream; vanilla bean cheesecake with blueberry compote and semolina tuile; chocolate ganache cake with cocoa nib brittle and sweet cream; warm apple fritters with spiced sugar and apple cider caramel; fresh fruit platter (rocky sweet melon, brown turkey figs, and cho juro asian pears).  Favorite Dessert - Monkey Bread - The monkey bread was not a dessert that exuded elegance or fine dining in the traditional term. But it was delicious and so comforting, especially after such a robust meal, that for me, it brought back those feelings you have as a kid. Flaky, sweet, with the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. The pecan toffee just knocked it out of the park.   I could sit here all day and talk about how delicious the meal was. But it was more than that. Eating at Craftsteak was an absolute privilege and I am so happy that I had the opportunity to eat there, and I'm very much looking forward to it again the next time I'm in Las Vegas.  TLDR: Wagyu Beef Tartare was exemplary. Wagyu Skirt Steak blew away the Ribeye and Filet Mignon. Monkey Bread is out of this world. Superb service. Simply put, the Grade 7 Wagyu Surf and Turf was worth every penny and you are doing yourself a disservice by not coming here. EAT THERE NOW.",

My wife and her brother started with superb tang10 martinis, with perfect blue cheese olives, and we ordered the wageiyu surf and turf taster menu for the table.  It was out of this world.  lobster, perfectly done in a buttery broth of morel mushrooms and peas...tender and moist...amazing, then filet, hanger and ribeye...cooked a perfect rare, melt in your mouth goodness.  The sides were perfect...we especially liked the mushrooms.  Desserts were incredible, with the ice creams and sorbets leading everyone's favorite list, but the monkey bread and peanut butter something, and lemon cheesecake were s good we couldn't help but eat them despite being so full as to risk food coma.... All in all one of the top ten diners I have ever had, and I have had some truly wonderful meals around the world.   The service was terrific, despite the crowd, with a team of four tag teaming us.  While we have sworn off beef for a week or so, simply because we had a surfeit this time, I would go back for the next special event!  Love the ambience, and the whole experience....and the stones concert was a perfect end to a perfect evening....",

The tables are large, almost too large, but allowed for plenty of room when the food started coming out! They have a classic cocktail menu, and don't skimp on the alcohol. I had a Moscow mule to start, and my husband had a smokey martini, with scotch and vodka.   I started with the lobster bisque. It was amazing! There was so much lobster meat in that soup and it was so rich, a great way to start the meal. My husband started with the seasonal oysters. Can't go wrong with oysters! For entrees I had the dry aged strip steak and my husband had the bison steak. The steaks were cooked perfectly. We also had the roasted heirloom cauliflower and farro for side dishes. We really did not need 2 side dishes. There was so much food! Not only was the food great, but the portion sizes were much larger than either of us expected. We did leave room for dessert, and split a couple of scoops of ice cream.   Overall this was a great meal, but a definite splurge. We each had a cocktail, and 1 glass of wine each and our total bill was around $240, including tip.",

I loved the presentation of the steak- in a skillet with the meat cut into strips with care.  The sides and starters were definitely not a throw away.  I think I could have licked the bowl of the lobster bisque.  Then when I though we were done, the dessert came!  Came with our chef's menu.  In addition- they gave me a happy birthday monkey bread!  The service was top notch.  Not a flaw and perfect timing from when we sat down all the way to dessert.  While the service was in teams...which I am not sure I liked...they really made sure we had what we needed and were enjoying it.

And the service was fantastic to boot.   Waygu beef is their specialty, so why would you not get the Waygu beef?  It's not cheap but c'mon, this is Vegas, my guess is you've already wasted as much on slots/poker/craps/roulette/etc. If you're not a local, when in Vegas, live it up!   We decided to get the three course meal, and it was an obscene amount of food. Between two of you, you get three half salads, lobster bisque, two types of Waygu beef, three sides and four deserts. Redic, but oh so delicious. When you look at the cost of that, compared to the cost of the filet, just go with the three course meal, you can't go wrong. Nothing disappointed - and even though I could only eat one bite of the monkey bread, man that was one delicious bite.   Sure, you can find a less expensive place to eat, but you won't find a more delicious steak.",

    "text": "WINNER WINNER, STEAK DINNER!  My first experience here at Craft Steak was a pretty bad one. Why you ask? First of all, I was very young. Secondly, what the hell did I know about good steak!? Absolutely nothing. Well, my boyfriend and I decided we'd give it a second chance since we saw that yelpers gave it such good reviews and we found out that it was owned by Tom Colicchio. PLUS, we had a nice win at the Palazzo so dinner was on them! Hahaha.  We were seated within 5-10 minutes upon arriving for our 8:00 reservation. If you plan on come during a holiday weekend, reservations are highly suggested because they get pretty booked up. The entire restaurant is very dimly lit with a romantic ambiance so it was perfect for our date. Freshly baked dinner rolls are served while you wait to order.   We both decided to order the Grade 8 Kobe Style Wagu Beef (14 oz. Ribeye). To my surprise, the 14 oz. turned out to be a very large cut. The was my first time trying Wagu and it was delicious! The only this is, we ordered the steak to be cooked medium and although it had the pink center, the outer part of the steak was too charred so it made the steak slightly dry. For our sides we had the Roasted Garlic and Leek Potato Gratin and the Green Been Amandine. The potatoes are a must try! Full of garlic flavor and oh so delicious!  The best part of dinner was the dessert of course! We tried the Liquid Chocolate Cake with Sicilian Pistachio Ice Cream. Mmmmm Mmmmm good! If you like the mild bitterness of dark chocolate, you will definitely love this dessert.  Service was good, but wasn't great. Probably wouldn't come back anytime soon, but glad I gave it a second try.",

Were it not such an upscale, classy establishment, I would have shouted the \"Woohoo!\" part right there on the spot.   I wanted to take my girlfriend to one really nice dinner while we were in Vegas together, something really memorable. Based on good reviews, my penchant for a nice steak, and a strong recommendation from my friend Randi B., Craftsteak got the nod.   I made a reservation for Friday at 8:00 PM, but we ended up hungry and ready an hour early. The nice people at Craftsteak go us a table at 7:05 in their gorgeous dining room.   We started out with a Caesar Salad and Lobster Bisque. The salad was excellent, but the bisque was absolutely outstanding. Big, meaty chunks of lobster in the bottom of the bowl right where you can see them before the server pours the smooth, succulent bisque on top. Perfect presentation, top notch ingredients, and amazing flavor. I love bisque and this stuff was amazing.   Then on to the steak. The flavor was so complex that on the first bite, I missed the point. I didn't get the subtlety of just how great this steak was. I tried a bite of my girlfriend's Filet Mignon, and I initially thought that she made the better choice. But when I got back to my skirt steak, the perfect marbling, the amazing seasoning, and the way the steak held its flavor became apparent. The filet was amazing too, and slightly more tender then the skirt steak, but flavor of the skirt trumped it. Randi recommended this steak to me specifically, and I in turn recommend it to you.   For the starch, we had potatoes au gratin. Again, wonderful. But the real star of the \"side\" lines was the Brentwood Sweet Corn. My girlfriend took the first bite of this, and let out a small sigh of pleasure, and said \"Oh, you have to try this.\" It really was amazing. In fact, the best corn I have ever eaten now that I think about it. I don't know what it was, it seemed to just be grilled corn on the cob, cut off, and dipped in some light butter sauce, but my god. We were calling it \"Crack Corn,\" because it was like crack. Again, I highly recommend it.   Dinner also comes with free freshly baked dinner rolls here. We had two orders, the second without the salt on top. The bread was amazing, and better without the salt.   After all that, we were too full for desert, which is a bit of a shame, because I'll bet it would have been transcendent. But, as I always say in Vegas, you have to know when to hold them, and when to fold them.   Niether of us drink, so we had nothing but water in the liquid department. After the soup, salad, two steaks, potatoes, and corn, the total was $200.43. Craftsteak is certainly not inexpensive, but even at $100 a head, before tips and drinks, it was still really good value for money. If you want a great steak dinner on the strip, Craftsteak does it right.",

The cherries definitely help bring out the taste in the duck. However, i don't think I would come back here again. Not worth the money.",

However some of the sides were Luke warm which was an awful disgrace to the greatness it could have been. The service was great except for there lack of communication. I was fairly excited to come here but honestly it wasn't worth it. By the way if you decide to ignore my review and go, the potato puree is fairly good and charcuterie is excellent.",

    "text": "I don't know who this chef is, but one of the girls from the conference was raving about him and this steakhouse. I don't eat beef so I ordered a salmon entree while she had the 8 oz. flat iron steak. Another girl had their scallop appetizer and we all shared the Italian buffalo mozzarella, potato puree, and baby spinach side dishes.  I have to admit that the potato puree was fantastic, especially when eaten with the garlic spinach. It was so smooth, creamy, and flavorful with a sprinkling of chives! The biffalo mozzarella was also delicious. The tapenade on top with hazelnuts complemented it well. My friend enjoyed her flat iron steak. She was in beef heaven! She also had a dark and stormy, which is some kind of cocktail with ginger beer. It reminded me of a moscow mule. My salmon dish was pretty good, but not spectacular. It was a pretty thick filet with a nice crust on a bed of swiss chard.  For dessert, we had the cinnamon monkey bread. I was so full, but did have a bite of the ice cream with caramel sauce. While the ice cream was tasty, the sauce was way too sweet! I couldn't handle anymore and didn't even bother to eat the cinnamon bread, which was drenched in the caramel sauce.  It's a very expensive restaurant with excellent service and a nice wine list. We were seated at a table that was perfect for people watching. My friends and I did notice the fairly large number of men that were there in groups. And they didn't look like bachelor party type guys either. They were older gentlemen in nice attire, drinking wine and enjoying their meat. Totally right up my friend's alley! I predict many outings to steakhouses in her future.",

    "text": "Not really impressed with the quality of main course. I ordered the wagyu surf and turf from the chef's menu.   First Course They brought out 4 appetizers (Persian Cucumber Salad, Caesar Salad, Lobster Bisque and Prosciutto) and they were good. Lobster bisque was creamy and flavorful, the salad dressings for the salads were done nicely.  Main Course Then they brought out the main course which was Lobster, wagyu rib eye, skirt steak, mashed potato, Brussels sprouts. The skirt steak was absolutely horrible. I could not even cut through it with my steak knife and once I did manage to cut them they were so chewy. I think the problem was they did not trim the meat to get rid outer chewy layer. The rib eye was just ok and the lobster was a little chewy. If I am going to pay $160 per person, I expect a good quality of meat and I was pretty disappointed with the main course.  Dessert They brought out 4 dishes which were pretty darn good. Monkey bread and vanilla ice cream was amazing.  I give this place 3 stars because a premier steakhouse should be serving better quality meats.",

Speaking of dessert, the choices were nice, but I would rather eat a few more of the AMAZING dinner rolls.   Pricey is a matter of opinion.

    "text": "Thanks for this restaurant, Tom Colicchio. I went with a large group of friends. There were 8 of us total. We made a reservation days in advance with no issues. After looking over the menu, everyone decided on getting the chef's beef selection of grade 7 wagyu beef. Seeing how it is the chef's selection, we had no idea what we were getting besides all the cuts of wagyu steak they had available. First came the rolls and butter. These rolls were already delicious. We all devoured them pretty fast and asked for more.   Appetizers Persian Cucumber, watercress and ginger salad - nice and refreshing Whole grilled shrimp Prosciutto with plum relish Wagyu Beef Tartare with crostini - amazing. I've had it at a few other places, but this was way better than others I've tasted.  Main courses with side dishes All cuts of grade 7 wagyu. Everything was so delicious. I would say the best steaks I've ever had so far. Steak temperatures on point. Perfectly medium rare. Seasonings just right. Dip the steak back into the skillets and get even bolder flavors. Take it up another notch, grab the dinner rolls and sop up the meat juices too! Forget bread and butter. Bread and meat sauce is better. Side dishes included, asparagus, mushrooms, and yukon gold puree. Sides complemented perfectly and enhanced the experience with the different textures and flavors.  Desserts were last Cinnamon Monkey Bread, assortment of sorbets/ice cream, dark chocolate tarts, bread pudding, and fresh fruit ended the meal very nicely. My favorite dessert being the monkey bread.  Service was great. Waitress was very friendly and gracious. She even joked with us that she might even see us at the clubs afterwards. Everyone left very satisfied.",

    "text": "Second day in Vegas. Over-sized margaritas and cold beer are keeping my mind sane and calm, so many colors, sparkles, beautiful women, shows, bright lights, moving objects with sounds. Like any other simple boy, I am a sucker for these things.  Can not drive the convertible obviously, the fuzz in my head is remarkable. It almost feels like, I am listening to Arabic hip-hop and wandering around a desert, lost and hopeless. Get a cab or a camel and go for dinner. I desperately in need of  heavy protein intake. The cab line-up, reading the guide, saw a familiar name. Tom Colicchio. I like his TV personality, looks like a good guy. Don't think too much, hop on the good foot and do the bad thing. Here we go.  The restaurant is just beautiful, modern and relaxed. Friendly in a very sleek way which is a perfect set up for a steakhouse. Steakhouses should not be intimidating. Sat at the bar, you know what, let's do beer tonight and straight from the bottle. All classics are on the menu. Most of the items are 3 ingredients only. Good sign, very good sign. Bread rolls; six of them are jumping out of a Lodge's square iron cast pan, reaching up like flowers to the sun, hot, sweet, delicious. Personal favorite; Kushi oysters, small, succulent and creamy. Salad of caesar -must at a steak house-, high in acidity, so fresh, so appropriately done. All the fuzz is gone, I am surprised that everything is flawless, or I am very drunk. Wouldn't know.  18 oz, bone-in rib-eye, medium, just because you would like the middle fat cooked through, so it melts on your palate. I usually cut out the cap and eat it separately. That little bit is incredibly flavorsome, should be savored on its own I believe.   There she comes, I watch her glide through the dining room on the arms of her handler - and thank god this time it is not a father-, I know she is mine, laying down as beautiful as can be on a oval copper pan, I can hear Etta James in the back of my mind, singing; ''At Last''.  The char, the crust, the seasoning, the doneness, no stupid garnishes, no games, NO PRE-CARVING (thank god!) in the kitchen. It is the finest steak I have ever had in a restaurant. I am about to burst into tears, I am pretty sure I am not drunk... It is so good, so good, so, so good. As I was dealing with all the emotions, my enthusiasm attracts attention, couple seat over an indistinct chatter; '' I want whatever he is having''. Halfway through this experience I realized I had mashed-potatoes or the potato puree as a side. The word ''puree'' is not clicking with me for some reason, reminds me of baby food or something whipped heavily because it is not presentable on its natural form. Anyway one fork in, I stalled.  When you go to culinary school, in most of the classes, smoothness, shapes, colors, uniformity are more pronounced by the instructors instead of the actual flavor factor. That is why cooks are more obsessed with the doneness and composition rather than the flavor I think. This potato dish was bursting with the sweetness of a properly made mash. It is not as creamy or silky and nor it should be as you would find in other fine food establishments, but extraordinary. The starch of the potato is cooked through so there is no residue on your palate, it swallows very clean. Seasoning is perfect, and I mean perfect. I am overwhelmed, I can not take it anymore. I can not go back to other mashed potatoes! My whole take of mash is changed with my first bite. I suspect if they used fingerlings, it tastes so. I forgot about the steak already.  After that day, I have changed the way I make mashed potatoes. I started cooking them in skins, peel hot, add appropriate amount of butter until the tightness of the mash is almost gone and emulsify with hot milk, season. Cream, screw cream, not only it dilutes the potato flavor, but it gives a thick body to the puree. I think smooth substances should be lightened up with liquids with low-viscosity, so they loose that gunky palate feel.  I step out, completely transformed, happy, satisfied. Now I need an 32 oz margarita to wind down. Hands down it was one of the best meals I have ever had.   Thank you chef, this meal probably will be the only thing I remember clearly from a wild Vegas trip.  Oh, and the Spearmint Rhino. It was awesome too.",

    "text": "I am a self proclaimed steak connoisseur.  During my most recent visit to Las Vegas (which I am still there), I decided to give my task of going to 5 top steakhouses in Vegas and keeping meticulous notes and pictures of what the experience was like.  Craftsteak was my second night of my steak escapade.    I tried to give no favorites throughout my trip but so far, Mr. Colicchio is on the top of my list of best in Vegas.    Ambiance: Nice chic and professional.  There was soft music and it felt like a nice place to have a date (a very expensive first date or a \"I'm sorry\" honey makeup date..I was there for the latter).    Service: The staff was very cool.  Very knowledgeable.  I asked so many questions about the techniques and the ingredients, I thought he would get annoyed.  But I think once they saw me taking notes, they assumed I was a critic (little did they know) and even told me about some other steak  houses I might enjoy.  Everything came promptly and they were very attentive.  Bread: The complimentary bread is like a side dish...in fact it comes in a hot iron cast pan.  As soon as it came, you have this wave of buttery aroma.  There is wet sea salt on top of the bread roll that produced a pretty good crust with a oh so soft interior.  Not for the faint of heart or for people with hypertension.  Appetizer: I had the warm Fri-see salad with and egg and bacon.  There was a nice mix of bleu cheese and smokey bacon prosciutto.  There was no ingredient overpowering the other (unless you bite directly into a bleu cheese crumble or hearty thick bacon piece).  Side: Brussel sprouts - now if you were the type of kid that hated brussels when growing up, you'd be very turned off by hearing a steak house has brussels.  I, personally, never had the experience of eating it when I was younger but if it was anything like the brussels here, I would welcome it with open arms....or maybe it was the smoked bacon they added. I guess bacon can make anything better.  Steak: Ribeye - came in the pan it was cooked in but it didn't come out very warm.  I had to personally transfer my steak to my own plate, which was pretty weird for a high end steak house, but with that aside, the steak was excellent.  It was cooked to perfection the way I wanted it and it had a great cross hair char.  The bordelaise sauce and baby taragon added a nice burst of flavor and created a nice \"glaze\" on the steak.    Of all the steak houses i've tried so far, this is definetely one I would return to again when in Vegas.",

    "text": "Because there are so many top-notch steakhouses to choose from, I take my steak experience very seriously in Vegas. I read a ton of Yelps about where to get the best steak in Vegas, and I'm pretty sure I made the right choice.  I am a fan of grass-fed, so I started my research looking for a steakhouse that offered grass-fed beef. I was surprised how few there were. This website is super-helpful for discerning the different types of steak offered in vegas: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vegasmadeeasy.com%2Fdining%2Fsteakhouses%2F81-steaks&s=83799d15fb71f0c2fd728fe1b408008813303ad32e119680bf777557add96a25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vegasmadeeasy.com/dining...</a>. I had no idea there were so many choices.  At any rate, I narrowed my choices down to those that serve wagyu, and Craftsteak supposedly does it best. It's hard to say this was the best steak I've ever had because comparing regular beef steaks to a wagyu steak is like comparing apples and oranges.  The menu has traditional beef steaks, domestic wagyu, and austrailian wagyu. I understand that from time to time, they do have grass-fed on the menu. I ordered the domestic wagyu skirt steak ($69) and my husband ordered a traditional strip steak ($55). We wanted to be able to compare the two. Both portion sizes were generous. Mine was 14 oz. and I think the hubs' was 16 oz.  Skirt steak is generally a very lean cut, and I don't think I've ever seen it offered as a \"steak\" entree, but wagyu is different. Unlike regular steak, the fat of wagyu is tiny flecks marbled throughout the cut, which allows leaner cuts that are generally cooked other ways to work as a grilled steak entree when it's waygu.  The wagyu steak comes already cut into strips, which I thought was odd. But it didn't seem to negatively affect the juiciness of the meat. Both of us ordered ours medium rare. The were perfectly cooked. Because i was curious, I asked the waiter how they can make them well done, or even medium well, given the composition of the fat in the meat, and he said they do infact make them that way when someone orders them, and because it is a thin cut of meat, it only takes a few minutes to get it to medium well and the fat doesn't have time to render out much.  The wagyu steak was so tender that you could lay you knife on it sharp side down, and the weight of the knife would cut the steak. It was uniformly juicy, almost bordering on greasy, but certainly not in a bad way. It was hard to describe, but unbelievably delicious.  There was a cheaper offering on the domestic wagyu menu, I think around $61, and two more expensive ones, I think the NY Strip was around $100 and the filet around $115. The Austrialian wagyu was well over $100 for the cheapest cut.  Craftsteak offers complimentary bread, which is good, but don't waste your stomach space on it. We split a side dish of the grilled corn, and it was amazing; better than you'd expect. We also go the wagyu tartare appetizer. It was fantastic, but again, I didn't have anything to compare it to, since I've never had wagyu beef or steak tartare before. It came with a quail egg on top and was served with toasted crostini.  Our bill was just south of $200. We had an appetizer, a shared side dish, two steaks, and my husband had two beers and I had a glass of wine. Our meal was well worth the cost, and I'd go there again in a heart beat. If you're a steak person, definitely splurge on the wagyu beef.",

    "text": "This was the second time I have eaten at Craftsteak. The first time was in Los Angeles. I like this restaurant very much. It's very easy to get to especially if you are staying in the MGM.  When we arrived we were seated right away and experienced terrific service all night long. We ordered the beef tartare to start. I thought it was pretty tasty, but my wife thought it was a little gamey. For our entrees we split a 22oz dry aged bone-in NY strip with sides of potato gratin and creamed spinach. Personally I was not a big fan of the taste of the steak. It tasted of hamburger to me. I don't have much experience with dry aged steaks, so maybe that's just part of the flavor. It was better dunked in the sauce that came around the steak. The previous time we had split a Rib Eye and loved it.  Overall, a little pricey, but a great dining experience.",

    "text": "As a fan of Tom Colicchio from Top Chef I really wanted to love this place.  Today's rating reflects the disappointment I felt. The rating is also based upon a comparison with comprable restaurants as Craftsteak would get five stars if I compared it to Sizzler. (sorry all you sizzler fans)  I expected an overpriced steak house so the three rating is not a reflection of price so much as it is of value.  For instance, I have had 5 star experiences at Hank's and Delmonicos.  From the moment I walked in, I was disappointed.  While I expected a somewhat less glitzy environment, I felt like I was in the Hofbrauhaus as the place was jam packed with tables, noisy and the decor seemed uninspired (cow paintings, really? And not very good ones either).    I have to give a shout out to the 5 star service we received.  The waitstaff was amazing.  Yet I found it disconcerting that the dining manager was out in the dining area discussing issues and business within four feet of the diners.  We started with the diver sea scallop appetizer which was exactly as advertised and well prepared so I began to feel at ease.  The waiter suggests the scallops or the lobster bisque but we knew we could never finish two appetizers and our meal. The drinks, although pricy were creative and excellent as well.  I ordered the rib eye and my dining partner ordered the surf and turf.  We ordered sides of mixed exotic mushrooms and grits with bacon.  The sides were excellent and the grits may well have been the best dish of the meal even if grits aren't your thing.  The main course arrived and well I can only say I was overwhelmed by the size and underwhelmed by the taste.  The large 18 OZ ribeye looked so good in the metal pan that I couldn't wait to dig in.  But first I have to rewind.  I like my steak medium rare most of the time but I find good steakhouses tend to think rare = raw, medium rare = rare etc.  So I asked the waiter what the chef's medium rare was.  The waiter told me medium rare was red center, pink surrounding and medium rare was pink all the way through.  So I went with medium rare.  Unfortunately it came out red all the way through.  Im ok with that but I would have gone with medium had I known.   The steak was well seasoned but the meat was much tougher than I have had at other steak houses and the marbling was not rendered down enough causing a rough cut.  The Lobster was nearly flavorless and chewy.  The filet was cooked medium but was actually medium rare so we enjoyed it but it too did not pack a punch.  We looked at the desert menu but I was already disenchanted so I refrained.  My dining partner had the souffle which was not in the top 5 souffle's we have had, even at less distinguished establishments.  So while the meal was above a chain and probably above most off strip places, it earns a 3 which according to Yelp means A-OK which satisfies my review standards.  4 would mean I was a fan which I am not and will not go back short of someone offering to pay for the meal which was pricey (2 people, 4 drinks, 1 app, 2 steaks and 2 sides nearly $400.00.    They do offer fixed price meals with choices which would have given us more food for only a little more money but we didn't finish what we had and were glad we didn't opt for the extra side and dessert.  Bottom line, while this is a premium steak house there are many equal or better choices for the same price or less within 15 miles.  I could list about 10 off the top of my head if anyone wants to know.  I'll make a list if some of you readers ask.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to eat here for our first anniversary hoping for an amazing experience, because we had been wanting to eat here for a long time.   We started with the frisee salad which had bacon and bleu cheese dressed with a vinaigrette. The bleu cheese and vinaigrette were pretty overpowering, so we didn't even get through half of the dish, and found that was more than enough. What was odd was that none of our servers asked if we enjoyed it or not. Just simply a, \"are you done with this?\" on a dish that was still half full. This was a 2-star dish for us.  5-stars for the Braised Shortrib that I ordered. I was reluctant at first, because being at a steakhouse, I was leaning towards getting a steak. With reassurance from our waiter that it was the right choice, I kept it. When it came out, I was glad he told me to stick with the order. It was an outstanding dish. The tender meat and the delicious broth was exactly the kind of dish I was hoping to be wowed by.   3-stars for the bone-in ribeye that my wife ordered, which only looked amazing, but was only okay. It was cooked exactly the way we ordered, but did not seem like the highest quality meat. The cut was not tender, so not easy to knife through. All in all, it's not something that either of us would order again especially not for the price. She said the best thing about the dish was the shallots, which isn't too encouraging.   4-stars for the 3 sides we ordered. The Brussel Sprouts with bacon and bernaise sauce, potato puree, and tempura zucchini, were very good-- dishes we would order again.   Finished the meal with the monkey bread and vanilla bean ice cream (substituted for the banana ice cream). That was amazing dessert to end with. 5 stars for this dessert.   We thought the night had ended as a good experience, but unfortunately found it to be ultimately disappointing. Had the night ended well, we probably would have been  able to get over some of the mishaps that happened. We had some minor issues with the service quirks--the team service, while seeming more efficient, may not have been communicating well, which may have resulted in assumptions that someone else was taking care of things like our experience with our first dish, or not packaging all the dishes we didn't finish to go, or how the sommelier(?) just came over with no introduction and just kind of squirted wine into my glass (I understand it is supposed to be a technique to aerate wine but the way he did it was) in one of the least appetizing ways to pour.  When they charge the kind of money that they do, as a customer, you expect nearly everything to go well. We got home at the end of our night to find that they didn't pack all the food we didn't finish, missing the most important dish, the shortrib, of which we made specific requests to have packaged.   I just feel cheated out of getting the full experience especially after paying as much as we did.",

    "text": "Wow! Food + Service + Atmosphere=The perfect night out!! I went here with a group of 10, and was surprised to get a reservation within a few hours on a holiday weekend! I had never been here before, but a friend suggested it would be the perfect place to get a nice meal. Boy, was he right (don't EVER tell him I said that)! We ordered the chef's special for the 10 of us. It started with salmon, scallops, and five different salads. Next was the wagyu steak...it included perfectly cooked ribeye, filet, strip and skirt steak. Yes, I said perfectly cooked skirt steak...it's possible! We also got perfectly cooked Japanese eggplant, risotto, fries, pureed potatoes (server even provided extra...we will get to him in a little bit). We were stuffed, and still had dessert coming! Holy monkey bread!! It was covered in caramel,and baked to perfection. Also served, was fresh fruit, chocolate mouse, blueberry creme brulee (more like a tart if you ask me), and multiple scoops of sorbet (pistachio was my fav)! This place was to die for and definitely a win for any foodie.  Now onto atmosphere and service. One thing I liked about Craftsteak was the variety of people. There were couple enjoying a romantic dinner, but still areas for big groups! Kevin was our server and he definitely is doing the business well. He immediately convinced all of us to order the special, was knowledgable about the menu, and let's be honest anyone that can deal with my group for a few hours is ok in my book! Kevin took care of us and was friendly and professional.   I'm definitely going back!",

Everyone was really nice it seems like each table gets two waiters/waitresses so there's always someone to help us if we needed anything.   Overall experience with customer service was fanatic. However, the food there didn't really blow me away. Don't get me wrong everything was delicious, especially their lobster bisque! But nothing really exceeded my expectation in terms of taste. I wish they had a bigger/better dessert selection though.",

It blows every other steak I've had out of the water, and that includes Peter Luger's in New York!  I had the bone-in ribeye.  Not only did they use a perfectly cut and marbled piece of steak, it was aged and cooked perfectly too to my liking.  Also it's cooked very plain and simple, with just enough seasoning and a little bit of demi glace sauce on it, just the way I like it, no overpowering sauces to ruin the natural flavors of the meat.  The sides were good too.  I don't usually order sides because I think they're a rip-off, but this place gives you good portions and the quality was very good, both the asparagus and the sunchokes.  But let's get serious, the main attraction was steak, and it was excellent!",

Portions are big so we didn't mind sharing. I'd recommend the lobster bisque and if you are in a big group for each person to order different sides. Staff was really accommodating since we came in late and they help taking pictures. I was a bit worried about dress code and it is business casual I just had some dark jeans, collar shirt, and some casual shoes. I did see a few ppl in cargo shorts and a t shirt. I'm not sure how they enforce the dress code. It might have been just a late night or customers had just deep pockets.",

    "text": "Craftsteak is.. for the uninitiated, one of the Las Vegas strip's finest steakhouses.  Located at The MGM Grand, I think it is better than Gordon Ramsay at Paris, on par with Jean Georges at Aria and the strongest challenger to the throne of my personal favorite, Carnevino at Palazzo.  The sexy, elegant, and modern lounge and bar give way to a beautiful and relaxing dining room featuring an open kitchen, comfortable banquettes, lovely booths and ambience to match. This could be a five star experience, however there were some service issues that bothered me.  For instance, while the service was good per se, and professional, it was also a little stuffy and curt. Again, I felt as if a case of reverse age discrimination was in effect just because me and my dining partners look young and were a bit rowdy and loud as the night wore on, we were written off as poor customers. Excuse me but between the eight of us we probably know more about wine, food and service than most working at Craft, but whatever. Just don't speak to me like I'm an idiot. Hate that.  There were several attempts at choreographed drops and pick ups of food at the table and all staff members were clearly not on the same page and it made for some uncomfortable glares across the table as well. Awkward. Really? Instead of just dropping my food when it's hot, standing there till everyone is ready? I get it, I really do, but it was a little much.   It's not a Justin Timberlake concert or the NYC Ballet, it's running food. Gimme it. Drop it. I'm hungry!  For a party of eight doing a tasting menu on a reservation, and having industry connections, I thought we would have been shown a little more hospitality as was the case up and down the Strip all month. I believe we all felt the experience was a little rushed.   Not only did support staff hover around the table but before you could put your fork down from your last bite your plate was being whisked away and the next course being rushed out.  Another issue.. I don't know if this is just our server or everyone at the restaurant, but aggressively filling the bottled water and bring refills of cocktails without asking Is inappropriate. I've worked in Michelin starred restaurants,  I've worked at a Texas Roadhouse. I don't care where you are, you ask before bringing it. Maybe I didn't WANT five Dark and Stormies?  Anyway, aside from the rushed, curt service and blatant money grabs, the food was outstanding, the space is beautiful and that's why this place gets four stars.   We started out with six interesting 2006/8 Italian blends and a enjoyed a big, beautiful,  Bordeaux for dinner, but we never saw the Som, or we probably would've ordered more. Again, was it our Age?  We all ordered the American Wagyu tasting menu. From the brief, rushed description by our waiter, we were to get three courses.    For the first course, appetizers disjointedly flooded the table, and I recall the Handcut Wagyu Tartar as a standout amongst them. I recall also, the risotto underwhelming most at our table.  As second course, I remember trying numerous salads.. my favorites being the Italian buffalo mozzarella, pork belly, and pan roasted red pepper.   As the steaks rolled out, so did that lovely Bordeaux.. I wish I could remember the name of it, but I was three or four dark and stormy's deep, not to mention all that wine?  Steaks.. 14 oz pieces of marbled, juicy heaven from Snake River Farms, all varying cuts. As I mentioned there are a lot of places to get $150 steak in Las Vegas.. Carnevino, STK, Jean George's, Strip steak, Delmonico, Gordon Ramsay.. and of them all, Craft Steak is probably one of my top.. two or three.  A bunch of the usual sides were at the table but all I remember are the white corn grits. Oh god.. white corn, bacon, Gruyere, and chives and oh my God I could've eaten four more bowls.  Again before I could even rest my fork, my plate was being whisked way and dessert was brought out. Awkward.  A TON of delicious food hit the table for dessert, along with some nice Ruby Port. Cinnamon Monkey Bread, Vanilla Cheesecake, Farmers Market Fruit, Ice Creams, and Spicy Sorbet.   Well, that was a nice surprise. So the meal ended up being a pretty good deal now that I think about it.. considering my steak alone would've been $105.00 plus the appetizers, salads, sides, and dessert. Well we ended up ordering ton of wine and a bunch of cocktails so I guess the restaurant made out well, too.   If Craftsteak figures out their service glitches and hires some people that want to sell instead of take orders and make sure the Sommelier hits every table, they'd have a five-star restaurant. For now four stars. This is a Tom Colicchio restaurant figurer it out.",

Again, both were good but not great.   Not sure if it was intentional but the bread they served in the beginning was hard.   Lobster bisque was pretty good.

If you have not ever eaten at a high end steak house you would probably be pretty impressed. Although being a bit of a foodie, and having eaten at many 4 diamond establishments, I am probably a bit more savvy when it comes to fine dining than your average Vegas patron.  Like i said the service here was excellent. I have no complaints at all in that department.  A solid 4 stars there.  We started with the fries (which we were told were amazing) and the divers scallops. The fries were very good...an amazing culinary revelation? No. The divers scallops were pretty meh, scallop quality was decent no the best I have had. They lacked that flavor profile and pop they should have had.   I ordered the braised short ribs and my fiance the rib eye. Both were good but again not amazing, short ribs were not anything I couldn't have made at home.  Sides we ordered asparagus and potatoes au gratin, they again lacked that real pop I would have expected.  If you are looking for a real treat Strip Steak at Mandalay bay would be you best bet. That was up there with the best food I have ever had.",

    "text": "Started with spinach salad w/apricots, arugula salad and buffalo mozzarella salad which had hazelnuts and pimentos.  Spinach salad was clearly market fresh spinach but didn't have enough dressing to have much of a taste.  Arugula and Mozzarella salads were good.  The mozzarella salad included hazelnuts, which were quite tasty.  The steaks were as expected, good.  The 29 hour short rib was melt in your mouth good.  The potatoes and asparagus were good but not memorable.  The service was great and so was the wine.  Ambience was very cool as well.  Your definitely paying for the name, steaks were a bit on the pricey side.  It was good but I wouldn't go back, too many other James Beard chefs in Las Vegas not to try others.",

Some of my extended family dined here and we were seated in a private dining area.  I think we totaled at around 15.  I apologize in advance for not being able to recall every dish that was ordered.  I know we started off with Maine Lobster Bisque, Risotto, and Potato Puree.  All were delicious but the lobster bisque was a bit too spicy for me to enjoy at length.  I know someone in my general vicinity had filet mignon, someone else had NY strip, another had lobster, and someone else took half of my rib eye.  Beyond that, I really couldn't say.  In any case, my rib eye (medium) was perfect.  Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and perfectly ingested.  As a side note, my cousin's adorable children (boy aged 3.5, girl aged 1.5) loved it here!  Service was good considering we were out of sight, out of mind.  Since we had two young children with us, we had plenty of requests -- high chair, small plates, etc.  However, they were very well behaved and loved the food (especially the risotto).",

Good cocktail made with Booker's Bourbon but since the drink was pink/red-hued and inside a martini glass it looked as if we were drinking Cosmos. - The complementary bread rolls come out toasty and tasty.    - I had the hangar steak (rare) and as a side the pureed potatoes.  My buddy had some steak and as a side small potatoes.  It was delicious and a lot of food so we couldn't finish either potato side dishes.   - Service was prompt and attentive.",

There were beers, cocktails, and wine. Tons of options at various prices. I ended up getting the prosecco, which was wonderfully crisp. We settled on the grilled calamari as an appetizer. It was OK, but nothing to rave about. I ended up ordering the surf and turf, which was FANTASTIC. This can easily be shared. The lobster sauce was buttery awesome perfection. However, I think the largest highlight was the monkey bread. An explosion of flavors for sure!   Overall, the food is great. The drinks are strong. The staff is knowledgable.",

The pear was almost like a puree with chunks and you could spoon it on the meat.  Had the salmon and cous cous and ordered a side of fries. The salmon was cooked perfect really moist throughout and the fries were amazing as well they had a little kick to them.   Overall awesome place really cool vibes and great drinks!",

Ok, the ambiance in the restaurant was nice... dimmed lights.. not too loud.. well dressed people.  The food was Amazing. I had a 6oz filet w/ seared scallops. My filet was cooked perfectly medium rare & the scallops were like butter in my mouth! The sides were ordered al a cart, in which we got a few different veggies. We had a table of 6 people, but we ended up with so much food.  The portions to the sides were large (sharing size), and the main dish, I think was just the perfect size. The service was good, they always made sure to check on us to see if we needed anything.. and they never let our glasses come to an empty. It was a bit pricey, but This place was soo good.. I'd go back!",

Shortly after we were seated, I was approached by Alexis who gave us our menus and their very extensive wine list. She went over the menu a little and gave us some time to think.   As soon as we placed our order, we were brought out four rolls. It was warm and buttery. Smelled and tasted amazing! For appetitizers, we had their shrimp cocktail and oysters. The shrimp cocktail was decent. Nothing bad about it. But their oysters were phenomenol.  My girlfriend ordered their 10 oz filet, which was great in size (most filets we've ever had were only 8 oz.) and also extremely tender. You bet she devoured it all. I had their 24 Hour beef short rib. It was absolute perfection. The meat practically cut itself, it was so tender. We also shared their asparagus and sweet potato puree for sides and both were very tasty.  Even though we were pretty stuffed, the monkey bread absolutely sold us. It cured my girlfriend's sweet tooth! My girlfriend wants to come back for their monkey bread alone, and of course to try more other their delicious items.   Great service, great food - what more can you ask for!",

    "text": "Being a fan of steak + top chef + and Tom I knew this place was must for one of our vegas dinners.  Decor: 4.5 stars, dark, yet comfortable atmosphere. Trendy yet sophisticated they have filmed a few episodes of top chef here as well as what our waitress hinted the finale for this season was filmed here, can't wait ;)  Service: 5 stars hands down. Everyone was attentive, professional, fit the bill of a 5 star steak restaurant. It's really the little things that matter, for example when we sat down our outfits were all Black, waitress made note of this and switched out our white napkins for black napkins, it's little things like this that set the tone of a meal for me. Was it necessary? no, did it have me wowed? Yes! Again I'm easily pleased, it's the little things.  Food: ok so this is where things got tricky, some foods were 5 star heaven in my mouth amazing, others closer to 3 stars, I was very disappointed in some options, I had high expectations which weren't fulfilled in every category of our meal.  Start with the food that was \"ok\".  Sadly the steak to me was not up to par with my expectations or the fact that when coming to a steak based restaurant I expect it to \"wow me\". Ordered the ribeye and while I have no doubt that the cut was amazing it was pretty bland, plain, nothing memorable besides the presentation/massiveness of the meat. To me it was under seasoned, trust me I understand to appreciate the steak itself you don't want a bunch going on to take away from the meat but sadly I was left underwhelmed on what I expected to be one of the best ribeyes I'd ever have. It's not a good sign to be at an establishment like this looking for salt and pepper shakers.  Also a miss for our table was the roasted pepper risotto, under cooked! When a side is left untouched by 3 hungry women you know that says something.  Anyways, aside from the service being amazing I stuck with 4 stars for a reason despite my underwhelming steak.  **The Lobster bisque had to be the best I've ever had hands down! Everyone at the table agreed it was fantastic, so creamy and smooth with big chunks of lobster a must have, truly memorable.  Lastly the brussle sprouts side was to die for! Really tasty, the perfect amount of crunch & flavor, this was seasoned correctly. These dishes on the side really made up for what the steak couldn't deliver. Would I be back? Most likely not, but again the lobster bisque may have me reconsider.",

    "text": "So while in Vegas I vouched to have at least one The Godfatheresque dinner. I was fumbling between Del Frisco's, STK and Craftsteak. Well what I went with is quite obvious now and it is a decision I do not regret.  The restaurant is located centrally within the MGM leading to the signature connector. Surrounded by the many shops that the MGM has to offer, this restaurant gives a welcoming vibe from the outside going in. The hostesses were super friendly and escorted us to our table, where I requested a seat change to a booth which they gladly moved us to :)  Service: George and Kevin are two guys I'd have to steal away from Craftsteak if I was opening up a restaurant in Vegas. Both were perfect examples of what 5 star service is. Genuinely attentive with smiles at every table visit. The lady running things with them could use a bit of a training session from them. 4.5/5   Food:  Ceasar Salad: Eh the lettuce was forgettable and the ceasar dressing was too. A replica of one you'd get at any other place in the world. The croutons were good though. 2.5/5  SALAD TIP: Their ranch is the best ranch I have had in my life..therefore I suggest you order a garden salad of some sort with ranch dressing.  Filet Mignon: The best. At the bite the tenderness was unmatched, miles ahead of any I've ever tried. The medium had the juiciness of a medium rare minus the red. Sauce-less but not an issue. 5/5...yes I 5'd a main dish  NY Strip (Bone-in): Juicy and a hypnotizing amount of flavor. I tried so hard to leave a couple pieces for small bites after my predicted night of hard drinking but I couldn't resist it. 4.5/5  Baby carrots: A good parent would bring their kids here for their vegetables serving. 5/5  Truffle Fries: I am sad to inform you that they were very mediocre. Maybe not enough people order them? I'm a 90's kid though, can you blame me? Forgettable but not terrible. Just okay I tell you. 2.5/5  Unfortunately I was too full for dessert, another tip, heavy meal it around 5/6 in Vegas, it's bad to exercise on a full stomach.   Drinks:  Cadillac Margarita (Don J): It's 2 for 1..based off alcohol content. Definitely a nice drink to keep that buzz going or started. 4/5  Lemonade: Meh 2.5/5  This was a great dining experience, Sad to say the only thing holding this from a 5 was the salad and the fries, that sounds so stupid doesn't it? The meats were some of the best I have ever had  and oh yeah the complimentary bread rolls..eyes open, mouth watering good. I'm so not a fan of repetition but I hope this place holds up for when I'm 55 and am too old and lazy to wander off yelp touring to try new stuff.",

AMBIANCE: Stylish decently sized restaurant with stylish dining areas. I was taking everything in then saw COW FACES staring back at me. I found it pretty tacky and crude to have such painting stare at me as I eat their cousin but pushed thru because I made reservations for steak.  FOOD: The bread was dry and oversalted served with more butter. I would've been better off toasting Hawaiian bread and eating it with marinara. My date asked the waiter if they had MASHED potatoes (menu only offers potato puree) and he said they did. I rolled over laughing when our baby food was served. It was good but heavily buttered that it thickened so easily to make an odd texture halfway through our meal. We both ordered the ribeye medium rare. First of all the plating was so difficult because it was served on a pan which was unstable sitting on top of a plate. It kept rocking back and forth as I cut it so I just transferred the whole thing to a plate. Crazy concept serving steak on a plate i suppose. Anywho thee WORST part was that my steak. I'm not a steak expert but I couldn't even chew thru it. I was hacking through the steak to find a edible piece but left more than half uneaten.   Staff: Honestly felt like they could care less about me and had no knowledge of the menu. The staff was talking amongest themselves and I had to get up from my table and interrupt them to get their attention. They did the minimum bare minimum.  This was thee worst fine dining experience I've had in Vegas. I lost all respect for Tom critiquing food when his restaurant can't even get the service right.  If you'd like to be robbed of your money and eat terrible food, please go here.",

Then we went to our main course which was a couple of steaks with mashed potatoes , asparagus , and mushrooms. Followed up with dessert that comprised of a banana bread with ice cream.

    "text": "Very underwhelming. We asked for the sommelier to recommend a wine. After a short discussion with what we thought was the sommelier, we found out we were speaking with a manager whom literally said, \"If you don't like it, it's okay. We make a lot of money.\" The wine he suggested was extremely tannic and bitter so we asked for another suggestion. The actual sommelier came over and was extremely aggressive. It felt like we were getting grilled about our likes and dislikes until he said, \"Do you just want what they have?\" (Pointing to a bottle our friends had ordered). In addition to the poor wine suggestions, we ordered a medium steak. It came out very well done (not a single sight of pink). Aside from the disgusting arrogance of the manager and the disappointing food, our server was gracious and top-notch!",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite steakhouse in the country and I really enjoy coming here when in Vegas.  First the dining room is spacious and swanky.  The service is very attentive and fast.   On to the food.  I always order the domestic Wagyu tasting menu- priced at $155 per person you get a corresponding number of cuts of Wagyu steaks depending on how many people order it.  For instance if two people order the tasting menu you can choose two Wagyu steaks and so forth.  You get to choose three appetizers/salads, lobster bisque is included as well as shrimp cocktail, steaks, three sides and they bring out desserts.  I highly recommend the warm Frisee salad, spinach salad and buffalo mozzarella.  Order the Wagyu ribeye and NY Strip- so rich and melt in your mouth goodness.  Please order them medium-rare.  Anything above it is doing it injustice.  Now, Wagyu steaks are rich so if you don't like that then the regular grilled steaks are fine too- just a different texture.   Steaks have a beautiful char and is seasoned perfectly with a nice crust.    The potato puree is so good but one order can feed four people so don't over order that.  The sides can all be shared.  By the time dessert arrives my belly is so full I don't touch it but it looks great.",

Went with a few friends and we all ordered a steak(I had the New York) and a few side dishes too.  We started at the bar for a martini before the meal which was made perfectly.  We moved to a great booth about 30 minutes later. I requested one. The lighting here is super cool, old school bulbs hanging From a 25 foot ceiling.  This was Friday night at 8:30 and when we were seated there wasn't a table open! You see great food, great service and consistency works every time.  I highly recommend the NY steak and whipped mashed Yukon gold potatos with the carrots as a side. (Unless the corn is in season)",

Had the arugula & pinenut salad, glazed baby carrots, pancetta risotto, assorted mushrooms and surf and turf (filet and scallops).  The salad dressing was VERY tart and the salad was way too big or shouldve been shared (wish the waiter mentioned that). Salad could have used a few more ingredients ..maybe egg and/or bleu cheese...definitely needed something to cut the sour vinaigrette. The filet and scallops were seared perfectly and delicious. The assorted mushrooms and baby carrots with rosemary were also very good but maybe a little big for 2 people.  Great meal, bring a huge wallet.",

    "text": "So, as a preface, I may not remember this entire gourmet experience because I was so blown away.  If you want to read up on this magical moment, refer to the reviews of Lan N., Alan W. and Steven H. because we all shared this magical moment together.  There were so so so many amazing parts to this meal, I am hard pressed to remember them all.  I will try to give the play-by-play highlights of this Cinderella night.  I will start with the sides that I remember the most: Yukon Gold Puree.  I have no idea what else is in here besides Yukon Potatoes and Butter, but whatever it is, holy crap it is addicting.  This innocuous, off-white color side dish packs flavor and velvety smooth texture and flavor and orgasms and flavor some more all into a copper serving bowl.  This dish singularly revived my love for potatoes.  Now, on to the steaks.  I will give my shout out to our waiter for the evening on this one.  So I was part of a bachelor party of 8 gents, and we could not decide on entrees.  So as a group, we all decided to splurge on the Wagyu/Kobe taster at the server's recommendation.  OH MY GOD.   Thank you restaurant gods for blessing us with an awesome server.  The recommendation on the taster was spot on.  We got wagyu/kobe filet, ny strip, rib eye, skirt steak and flat iron.  The flavor... the texture... the color... all sooooo perfect.  My highlights for the night were definitely the skirt steak and the flat iron cut.  The flavors from those cuts were f***in amazing.  Damn, I kinda want some right now...",

    "text": "This restaurant makes all of its patrons who walk out feel sorry for vegetarians. I'm sorry, but it's True.  5 Stars. Times a million.  Sometimes the best approach for eating out is deferring to others' wisdom. Here, that approach really paid off. Came here for my buddy's bachelor party dinner and luckily we had a Craftsteak veteran with us (Thanks YE Steven H!). This helped the ordering process go along a lot more smoothly.  Originally we were just planning to order for ourselves, but our wily veteran felt that it would be better if we ordered the multiple cuts and shared that among us instead. Our server understood and was very accommodating, which eventually led to us getting full stacks of appetizers, desserts, and of course, THE STEAK.  I've had Kobe beef in Kobe, Japan, but this was heads and shoulders above my experience there. Every bite melts in your mouth and the juices were so good that I needed more of those delicious rolls to sop up the remaining sauce. Even our friend who usually likes his meat a little more cooked through had to give it up that these medium-rare cuts of marbled beef were sublime. That being said, even though the meat was excellent, the accompanying sides of asparagus, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes were so freaking delicious that you don't mind it taking up space otherwise reserved for the beef.  Dessert came out after we were already stuffed, but we made room for the Monkey Bread (aka the Elegant Cinnabon), Ice Cream & Sorbets, Dark Chocolate Tart, Bread Pudding, and fresh fruit. Great finish.  I honestly think if we paid twice as much, it would still be worth it.",

    "text": "Being married to a restaurant guy, a foodie myself, and of course a Top Chef fan, I was very excited to go to Craftsteak while I was in Veags this week. I had just dined at Michael Mina at the Bellagio the night before, and was on a food high. Unfortunately, that ended after my meal at Craftsteak....underwhelmed would be the best way to describe it.  The restaurant is huge, with very little intimate dining space. While I was not on a date, or with my husband, it still made it difficult to chat with the friend I was with. The service was fine, attentive, but every now and then a different server would come by and offer the same thing we had just declined from our own server. Like a car dealerhsip, I felt like they wanted to get a sale so badly that they sent in the closer. Or, they just didn't listen to each other, either way, it was awkward. It was also a little wierd having the server's stand right in the middle of the room. While I was not facing that way, I could still hear all their chatter and the clanking of plates and glassware.  The menu is appropraite for the concept, sides are family style, and there are multiple tasting menu choices based on the style of entree you chose. But beware, they start at $119 for a Angus Filet, altho it is supposed to come with multiple sides. We opted for ala carte.  I started with the Waygu Tartare. It was good, but not great. In some restaurants they mix the egg in for you, but not here, and because it was in a bowl with crostini's all the way around, mixing was difficult. They also gave me a spoon, rather than a fork. Not optimal for dealing with the dish.  Then, since I couldn't make up my mind, I ordered the Surf 'n Turf, cooked mid-rare to medium, and 2 sides; the mixed mushrooms and the white corn grits. The sides were fine, but nothing to get excited about. While they were good sizes had I been sharing, they were a bit big for one person (my freind wanted something else). As for my entree, the filet was cooked to perfection! It was just the right temperature, and my knife cut throught it like butter. On the other hand, the lobster tail was the worst thing I had ever tasted! It was so dried out, I didn't even recognize the texture, absolutely flavorless, and it wasn't served with any clarified butter, which might have helped. Not to mention that it was almost cold. I left it on the plate, and was never even asked about it. We declined dessert.  So, as you can see, our experience was okay, just not great. For the price I paid, underwhelmed is not what I was looking for. I paid the same price for the Chef's Tasting menu (with pairings) the night before at Michael Mina and that was amazing, even tho it was slightly less food, it definately left you fulfilled. I would not go back to Craftsteak, and wished that I had spent some of the cost of dinner actually gambling. At least there is a chance of winning that way.",

So I figured if you're going to do something first, do it right. This place is definitely a special occasion place, unless you're the Monopoly man. It is very pricey. However, one does not feel ripped off. Meaning I have been to equally pricey places where you leave feeling hungry and kinda bamboozled. They still give you large shareable portions here, so nobody will leave feeling the need to hit up the White Castle after to fill in the nooks and crannies (although I did because I'm a fat monster). The 32oz Porterhouse was fantastic, it was interesting to compare each side of the cut - I preferred the filet, but only slightly. We had waygu tartar which was just insanely decadent and so very clean tasting. We even sprung for a $140 bottle of wine, which is outrageous by my typical wine drinking standards. But it seemed reasonable at the time considering there was bottles on there up to $12,000!! Their wine list is the most crazy thing I've seen. If you can't find a bottle to impress your date or business client's here, then you won't find it anywhere. They of course have all the scotches and manly cocktails you'd expect at a restaurant dedicated to eating cows too. So in short, Ron Swanson would approve of this place.",

Overall, dinner was not necessarily bad. But it was disappointing for a meal that costs about $100 per person. In fairness, the scallops were solid. But I have had better, larger ones at about half the price.  The sides, shared among a table of four, were a let down. From best to worst: the yukon gold puree, the mushroom melange, and the au gratin potatoes.   The yukon gold is unique and the only item I would order again if I were to return. Which is not something I am dying to do. In my opinion, CUT still remains the best steakhouse in town.",

Their steaks were delicious and cooked to perfection. My rib eye's temp was just right and the meat was extremely flavorful. I also got to try the Wagyu NY strip...$135+ for a piece of meat as big as my fist! But heck, although I felt like I was eating gold, it proved to be one of the most delicious piece of meat I'd ever tasted. It was melt-in-your-mouth, flavorful, and absolutely the most tender thing I'd ever had.   The side dishes, like the wild mushroom medley, were absolutely delicious!  The service was excellent. Some of the steaks were a little too charred and, unintentionally, this was casually mentioned to the manager who was making rounds at each table. She apologized profusely and comp'd one of each of the entire dessert menu! Wow, now that's wonderful customer service. I would not hesitate to come back here again...gosh, if only it wasn't so pricey! The desserts were so delicious and so delicately made. I'm normally not one to order desserts, but knowing how deliciously they made their desserts, I would definitely save some room next time.

    "text": "This is simply one of the best meals I've had in my life (and I've had a lot of good meals). We ordered the Chef's Selection three course menu, which includes two cuts of steak and a plethora of appetizers and sides.  I was so full after this meal that I skipped breakfast the next day, and ate a light lunch.  All of the dishes were outstanding, but my favorites were the rib eye and filet steaks, the warmed frisee salad with pork bits and egg, ALL of the side dishes (asparagus, wild mushrooms and a mushroom-topped risotto) and the home-made sorbets.  Extra points: my favorite Scotch is The Glenroths, which is brand that is not commonly carried in many bars and usually bars will only stock one bottle. Craftsteak had bottles from 7 different years on hand, first time I've ever seen that.",

Overcooked steak, salty spinach and asparagus just to name a couple.  Way overpriced for what we got.  $24 for a tiny serving of assorted mushroom was disappointing as well.  I've had much better food at other steakhouses around the country or even inside the strip. Freshly baked bread was the best part of the dinner food.",

    "text": "Took the BF here in October. I went here in June but didn't get to actually eat dinner. I just had some oysters and a caeser salad, both of which were good. However, I was much more impressed with their fresh bread rolls, baked fresh, brushed with butter and topped with salt. I also had a bite of my friend's salmon -which was perfectly cooked with a very crispy skin!   Soo... I was REALLY excited to eat at Tom Colicchio's Craft but unfortunately, my meal was just okay. The bf ordered the filet, I had the salmon w/ lentils, and we had a side of gratin potatoes and a caprese salad.   Bread rolls: As good as I remembered the first time. They melt in your mouth.  Caprese salad: good but the ratios were just slightly off  Salmon: Perfectly cooked, but no crispy skin. The lentils were well cooked, especially since I don't ever find them done well in non-Indian restaurants. However, this salmon was nothing spectacular...Not, however much I paid for it spectacular!  Filet: I tried a bite of my bf's filet and it was medium-rare and juicy, but for some reason, I'd prefer to have gone to N9NE. I think it's hard to beat Dallas for steak -compared to Del Frisco's or Bob's or Steve Field's.  Gratin Potatoes: These were really really bad and bland. I think they were made with some leeks and fennel which could have been great but they really messed it up. Yuck.   Service: The last time I was here, we had great service. But this time, it was terrible. We waited so long we had to call for a waiter... We saw many people get served bread rolls before us and we were ignored a majority of the night. Maybe they thought a pair of \"kids\" shouldn't be eating there...    Would I eat here again? No, I can probably make bread rolls myself... If im in LV and craving steak I'm going to N9NE in the Palms or Strip House in Planet Hollywood.",

    "text": "Wow! Hubby and I made reservations for Craftsteak thanks to our fellow Yelpers. We had originally planned to go to Seablue, but the poor reviews for service made us change our mind. 6pm reservation, and we were seated immediately in an almost-empty restaurant. That sort of freaked me out--what Vegas restaurant is nearly desolate on a Wednesday evening? The good part of that was that our food was delivered very promptly...and the food. Oh my God.  Bread: Comes out in its own mini baking tray. Six perfect rolls topped with sea salt and served with delicious butter. They were deliciously addictive, and I wish we hadn't eaten so much of it. It really dampened my appetite...  Lobster Bisque: Holy caloric explosion, Batman! The bowl is placed in front of you with huge chunks of lobster in the bottom, and then the sous pot filled with the creamiest bisque is poured into the bowl. It was truly amazing. My husband had the Caesar salad with pickled anchovies, and it was perfect--crisp, cold, flavorful and very big for an appetizer. In hindsight, we should have split an app instead of ordering two.  Main course: Hubby got the surf and turf. His filet was delectable, but his shrimp were just okay. He liked them fine, but he referred to them as \"nothing to write home about.\" My flat iron steak was perfectly cooked, and so flavorful that I closed my eyes with each bite. It was nearly a religious experience.   Sides: We ordered two sides, not knowing that one side would have easily sufficed. Husband got the fingerling potatoes, which were perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. I ordered the sugar snap peas which had just been picked THAT MORNING. They were so delicious--al dente, crisp, sweet and served on some sort of light chili sauce that made the favors pop. Truly amazing.  Dessert: Just couldn't. I couldn't even finish my meal, so I wasn't about to go hog wild on dessert.  Service: Top notch. We had at least three separate staff working our table, including one woman whose only job was to place our silverware. I want that gig. Everyone was friendly, attentive and congenial. One of the most expensive meals of our young lives, but worth it in every way. And Joe was the bees knees. We'll definitely be back!  Tips: Order one side for every two people. Share your appetizers. Easy on the bread. And why bring kids to a steak house where the cheapest cut of meat is $40? Enjoy!",

I had the 10oz filet, which I ordered medium rare, and it came out very rare, unusual for such a quality restaurant. They handled it well, but it was surprising. My friends had much larger steaks, and one had the short rib, which they all enjoyed. We had a bunch of sides including Brussels sprouts, baby carrots and the Yukon gold potato puree.  We shared a nice bottle of wine, and while it was a struggle, we managed to share the Monkey Bread dessert.",

Started off with dinner rolls that had the tops basted with butter and sprinkled with sea salt. The rolls were delicious.   I had ordered the Lobster Bisque. It was mixed at the table so you could see the many pieces of lobster in the bowl before the soup was poured in. It was also very delicious.  My main entree was the Snake River Wagyu Skirt steak prepared medium rare. It was very tender and was very happy that I ordered it. For my sides I had orders of Brussel Sprouts with bacon and onion and Potato Puree. Both were good but did not finish.  By this time I was pretty stuffed but there's always room for dessert right? So at the wait helps insistence I ordered the Cinnamon Monkey with Banana ice cream which I was glad I tried but also did not finish.  It was an excellent dining experience and was very happy that I was able to eat there.",

    "text": "Each time we visit Las Vegas, dinner at a steakhouse is a must.  There are so many top rated choices located on the the strip.  My BF is a total steak connoisseur.  I trusted his taste and let him choose our date night spot.    He made reservations at Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak for the 915 slot.  Luckily we did so 2 days prior or they get completely booked.  As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the lovely hostess.  Our table was ready in 5 minutes and we were seated promptly.    The staff at this restaurant is so fabulous and accommodating.  Our server was super attentive and friendly throughout the evening.  He served the wine and took our order right away.    The menu is simple with a variety of steak cuts ranging from domestic wagyu, A5 wagyu, filet mignon, rib eye, NY strip, hangar, flat iron, and short rib.  The wine list is quite extensive ranging from domestic to imported.    Our dinner choices: 14 oz grilled ribeye (medium rare).  Perfectly marbled and tender!  The steak is served in an iron skillet.  I think I may have gone to steak heaven.  Superb!  Surf and turf:: lobster tail and 6 oz filet (medium).  Grilled to perfection.  Most tender and juicy cut.  My all time fave!    Assorted mushrooms:: variety of 'shrooms sauteed.  Very delightful comp with your steak.    Dessert:: mango and coconut sorbet (made in house).  Light and refreshing.  Great option to cleanse the palate post dinner.    Complimentary rolls:: aka monkey bread brushed with oil and sea salt.  Warm and soft.  Delish!  The damage was about $300 for 2 including wine!!  The most amazing dinner on this Vegas trip!  5 *****star food, service and ambiance.  Bon appetit!!",

The first course there was NO Wagyu item, very disappointed as it was the wagyu sampler.  The main dishes were okay, a Filet and NY steak.  Not much marbling, and the meat was a big tough, maybe they forget it was suppose to be waygu or it was only grade 1, in which we would have chosen a prime cut. Over all we were very disappointed for a $500 meal.  I emailed them about it, never heard back, guess they didn't care.",

No need to dress up here just wear what you would to a nice brunch or something (it is pretty cold though so ladies, bring a wrap or shawl!)   Reservations for a Saturday night were pretty easy to get. We were seated within 5 minutes and handed one of the most extensive wine lists I've seen (it had an index!) The most affordable wine on the list was about $85/bottle and their corkage fee is $50. They partner with wineries to obtain special wines so I highly suggest trying one of their specials. They also have a sommelier on site, who we consulted for a red wine that would compliment both seafood and meat.  A server approached our table and took two of my friends' order and then just disappeared leaving us confused. Luckily another server came by and picked everything up for us with a great attitude.  I had the filet mignon since it's my favorite type of steak but seeing my friend's dishes, I wish I tried something more different!   I adore steak tartare but it's difficult to find a place that seasons it well. The wagyu one here definitely caught my eye but the seasoning lacked any depth. It was over-salted and I was sad lol.  Scallops were seared nicely in a simple sauce but wish there was a bit more flavor to it. Potato puree was nice but nothing I haven't tasted before.  My favorite part of the meal was actually the mushrooms LOL. The variety they had were fragrant and almost floral, which complimented the meat really well. It was a great addition.  They ran out of a wine we really wanted to try so my friend talked to our server quickly and she gave us a free monkey bread dessert at the end to share which was also a big highlight of the night.  Food wise, nothing was terribly wrong but at the price point, nothing also caught my eye or attention. This place is great for wine lover but for steak/seafood, Mastro's does the trick for me!",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review because I am a big fan of Tom, Top Chef and frankly most MGM restaurants. I had been wanting to try this place for probably 5+ years now and maybe I hyped it up too much in my own mind, i'm not sure. There were some hits and misses, but after taking a few days to think about it, I'm kind of bummed out overall.   To qualify my review, I have been to some of the best steakhouses in the country, including Mastro's in Newport Beach, Cut, Ruths Chris, Golden Steer, Prime 112 in Miami, Flemmings, Capital Grill, Del Friscos, Prime at Bellagio, Hells Kitchen, etc etc.  First I will say that the sommelier who was on-staff that night (a Thursday) was excellent. Extremely friendly, knowledgeable and really made our entire experience more enjoyable. I wish I could remember his name, but he was fantastic. The $50 corkage fee was high, but it's Vegas and I know how it goes. The rest of the waitstaff was fine if not forgettable.  The bread they start you off with is crunchy, light, sweet and delicious. Perfect starter.   I ordered the domestic waygu filet. While it was good, it did not live up to the hype or the price. It was cooked a solid medium, except for the very very center which was basically raw. For $130 I was pretty let down. Not terrible by any means, but just OK. I'd skip it and maybe try the Jap next time, or just the regular ol filet.  My wife had the braised short rib and I just couldn't have been more disappointed with this dish. Chewy, fatty, and no seasoning, bland all around. I make better shortrib at home in my oven. The menu says braised 24 hours and I just don't believe it. The 24 shortrib at Hells Kitchen is unbelievably better than this, like stunningly so. I wish she would have sent it back, but she was hungry and we had a table full of people.   Other tables entrees included the surf and turf, which I didn't try, but was told it was very good and another friend had the bone-in ribeye which he said was \"good, not amazing\"  Sides: Carrots: bland, no seasoning, cold. Skip Maui Onion: pretty darn good, not sure if worth the price, but seasoned very well.  Potato puree: Absolutely fantastic, maybe one of the best I've ever had. Must get. Mushrooms: Shitakes, again very bland, someone missed the seasoning again.   Desert: Creme Brulee was painfully average. Not bad, just not exciting at all.   Overall: At this price point, in this town, with so many fantastic restaurants around, this is going to be a one and done for me.   Unlike a lot of people that i'm sure dine here on the corporate card, I paid for this out of my own pocket with my hard earned paycheck and left a little sad about the whole thing.",

Even though the cut appeared to be rare it was actually tender and delicious not under cooked at all but not overcooked either - just right.  The Caesar salad - that was just OK, unfortunately they had no anchovies and the rest was very basic... so can't really speak to its full potential or lack of.  The mashed potatoes like the Caesar need some work. Good wine selection. I like the eat at the bar option. Cool place I def try again and hope it had some adjustments.",

Notwithstanding my roundabout way of indulging this pop-culture -zeitgeist-meets-culinary curiosity, Craftsteak is solid.  Housed in MGM Grand, the aesthetic of the restaurant's interior is far-removed from the adjacent casino halls populated by hotel guests wandering around with their player's cards and margarita yards. The dining room is dimly-lit by gorgeous wide chandeliers, and the dark walls are adorned with jagged-lined, rough-textured art pieces. The service is (surprisingly) lightning-quick, but to no detriment of the dishes' quality. My bacon-wrapped scallops were tender and succulent and my husband's steak was a generous cut seared to perfection.   Craftsteak's only feature with which I find fault is the pricey a la carte menu; I enjoy chefs taking creative license with specials. Dinner here will set you back a pretty penny, and I am still mentally wrestling with whether our meal was worth the price.",

I ordered the lobster bisque to start with.  It was bland.  For my entree, I ordered the Diver Scallops and Hen of the Woods Mushrooms.  The scallops were fine.  Just fine... nothing special.  The mushrooms were as dry as dust and tasteless.  After this, I didn't bother with dessert.  At these prices, I expected so much more.  Tom Colicchio would surely be upset that his name is attached to this food.",

    "text": "I am a big Top Chef fan and as such I was totally geeked about eating at one of Tom Colicchio's restaurants. Yelp won't let me assign half stars, but I would give it a 3.5 instead of a 3. A 4 would not be fair based on my visit. First, the service was very good. Though I did feel like they were pressuring us to proceed to the next course (It was not crowded as it was a weekday evening) they were overall very nice and accommodating. I will highlight good and bad points of the meal.  Cocktails: Delicious and refreshing.  Appetizer: We got the prosciutto and balsamic peach appetizer. Really good prosciutto. Loved it. We also got rolls and they were great. Hot and fresh from the oven.  Entrees and sides: This is where it went downhill a bit. We ordered the short rib, which was delicious and tender. So good! No complaints. We also ordered the domestic wagyu skirt steak, which was highly recommended by our server. I ordered it medium rare and it was in fact cooked perfectly. HOWEVER, it came out to me room at temperature--at best. No warmth. No sizzle. Cold skillet. That's not how a steak should be served. Ever. Huge ding right there. Let's move on to sides. We got the grits, which came out hot and were very yummy. Thumbs up. Then we got the honey glazed carrots, which aside from not being that unique in flavor, were also at room temperature. They should have been at least warm.   Dessert and coffee: We ordered the mango passion fruit sorbet and it was GREAT! We also ordered the monkey bread with banana ice cream, and while it was full of wonderful flavors and made to order, it was also a bit burnt on the bottom. Not caramelized. Burnt. We ordered cappuccino and it was really good.  I think all of these dishes could have been awesome (except for the carrots, perhaps). But the execution was not on point this visit. The serving temperature being so far off was a big deal.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I recently dined here and the food and service was amazing. Whenever we go to steakhouses he always orders the filet and I always have a bite. But the bone in filet here was so tender and juicy, it's probably one of the best I've tasted! I love mushrooms and always order them as a side instead of a starch. I'm not sure the names of all the different mushrooms in the assortment but i enjoyed them all. My boyfriend loves the fingerling potatoes here, they're very seasoned and a little on the salty side for me. But what i found interesting is they're a red/ purple color potato. I also ordered the scallops. A few years ago when I wasn't eating red meat, I ate here and I had ordered the scallops and they were so delicious. They were just as i remembered them! For dessert we had the cinnamon monkey bread which I enjoyed but I think next time I'll ask them to not top it with so many chopped pecans. I'm not a huge fan on nuts on my desserts. But the warm monkey bread and ice cream were the perfect amount of sweetness to end the meal.  Our servers were very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. They even offered to bring us another plate of bread since we finished it before our food was served. I had some leftovers and they packed it to go for me very neatly with utensils.",

    "text": "Now this is eating.  American kobe steak.  The hands down greatest steak I have ever eaten.  American kobe (wagyu) beef is a cross between the full Japanese cow and Angus.  This was done because the wagyu beef is extremely marbled, almost white and thus not as appealing to Americans.  Plus American kobe is alot less expensive since you only need one kobe cow to tango.  That being said Craftsteak does actually have 100% wagyu but it is crazy expensive.  They also have non kobe steaks, which are damn good.  Have tried the new york and it was awesome.  But I am here for the kobe steak.  So back to the meal, Craftsteak is located in the MGM Grand hotel.  I've been here twice now.  You can either order a la carte.  Steak, appetizers, sides, deserts etc, similar to other places like Ruths Chris and Flemings.  Or you can get a one of their taster meals, the basic one being $130 a person.  Pretty damn expensive but wow, that is eating like a king.  I've tried it both ways and its great either way.  Appetizers include kobe tartar which is awesome.  Sides like baby broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, and the spinach are good.  The potatoes are not as good as other steak places I've been to.  The deserts are pretty solid as well, ice creams, monkey bread, etc.  Most importantly though are the steaks.  The Flat iron is noticeably different from other steaks, but the kobe skirt steak, their signature steak, and kobe ribeye are awesome.  The ribeye is richer, almost too rich, than the skirt and is probably better but the skirt is definitely more manageable.  Both are great but if you are ordering a la carte and have to eat the whole steak yourself, get the skirt.  A la carte, the skirt is also 35 dollars cheaper as well.      The various samplers are expensive and worth it if you are very hungry.  But most people will not finish their meals and to leave any kobe steak over would certainly be a sin.  Also remember that kobe steaks are more filling than regular steaks, so choose wisely.  I find that I am fine ordering the kobe skirt and 1 side.  This place is excellent.",

The desserts were underwhelming, as was the service - although the service may have been an issue because I went during a very busy time.  I'd suggest doing the chef's choice for wagyu. Or just get the skirt steak, which is stellar. It's a good restaurant, but it doesn't compare to great restaurants in other major cities - the ambiance isn't as nice, and the wait staff seems overburdened.",

I compared it to the bone in rib eye and both had different flavors and texture.  The only bad part of the meal was ordering wine at this joint.  The winelist is massive and it took them over 30 minutes to get someone to take my wine order.  Lamers.  We tried a bottle of the Vineyard 29 but I wasn't impressed.  -1 suckaz.",

    "text": "Went there last week, dinner for two. It was expensive! Restaurant was packed, we had reservations for 9:30pm. Those without reservations had to eat at the bar. Lighting was dim, but I didn't mind. We were seated in a booth in the back, but once again I didn't mind because the place was completely full for the night. It was CES week after all... We didn't have breakfast or lunch that day. We snacked on a berry danish and smoothie from Jean Philippe in the afternoon so we could eat like pigs at night. ;) We ordered a few martini's and they were quite good. At $13 each, it's quite reasonable/cheap because 1) it's Vegas, 2) well made, 3) quite strong, 4) compared to drinks @ Sushi Samba, these were spectacular! We settled on the wagyu's chef tasting menu $130pp. I read a ton of reviews before I came here and heard how good the rolls were. They're just rolls, how good could they possibly be?? OMG! The dinner rolls were light and airy, came out warm and had just a touch of salt. I could've eaten a ton, but I didn't. We should've taken some to go, and made wagyu sandwiches with them.. =D 4 Apps:  Watercress and Cucumber Salad: really quite refreshing, yet very simple. Buffalo mozzarella: really liked this. I don't like cheese in general but the mozzarella was so creamy and with a touch of balsamic vinegar, it was delish! Hawaiian Prawns - seriously these were probably the best prawns I've ever had. Tons of flavor, thank goodness for the dim lighting because we sucked on the heads like Anthony Bourdain says it really is the best part.  Prosciutto with Pear Chutney: nothing special.  Main:  Wagyu skirt steak: my friend loves ribeye because of the fat content but he said the skirt steak was actually better then the ribeye... It was quite flavorful and charred just a bit on the edges. Wagyu ribeye: it was good, even better the next day.   Sides: Wild mushroom medley: delicious though a little bit too salty for me Creamed Yukon Gold Potatoes: creamiest mashed potatoes with so much butter.. I would never put this much cream/butter in my own potatoes, but they were so....good. Asparagus: grilled, something you can make at home, but good  I probably only had a slice each of the ribeye and the skirt steak because I was mainly concentrating on the sides. I don't really like steak, so my friend was eating most of the meat. Thank goodness we didn't have lunch that day because we were so full. We took what was left of the steak to go and we still had dessert coming up.   For dessert we were brought out: Dark Chocolate  Molten Cake, an assortment of Sorbet, Cherry Cobbler and some Grilled Pineapple. We didn't really care for any of them. So 1 star off for that. I've had way better molten cake, but I live in nyc; we have good food whether it's cheap or expensive. The grilled pineapple - really? who would pay for that? Sorbet was okay but I had better just the other night at the Venetian. Maybe a lil too icy and not enough fruit. I don't really think cherry cobbler belongs in an upscale restaurant. I want something richer or fancier, not something I could get at a diner. We took the desserts back to hotel as well. We spent a little over $400 since we had 6 drinks between the 2 of us. The next time I'm back in Vegas, I'd go back for drinks, but I'll probably check out CUT or Delmonico.",

    "text": "I've kept my eye on Craftsteak as well as a couple other restaurants but I was feeling for a good flat iron two nights ago and choose this place over Fleur De Lys and Mesa Grill.   Holy hell. I was so pissed to find out that Restaurant week in Vegas ended during the first couple days of my visit. I wanted the get the tasting menu that was $85pp but only $50 the day before! Should have punched myself in the face for that mistake.  Either way, everything was freaking delicious. The strength of the meal came in the steaks, scallops and sides. Perfectly cooked to a medium rare. The appetizers were good, but comprised of nothing cooked, so it was harder appreciate dishes that came in various marinades and dressings (we had shaved fennel salad, cucumber and watercress salad, buffalo mozzarella and proscuitto with figs). I would've appreciated the roast quail but they were out for the night. Dessert was good too, I'm a sorbet girl so I loved the peach and chocolate sorbet. Tasted like cocoa ice cream without the ice cream texture that I don't like. We also had molten chocolate cake and monkey bread which my bf loved.  Portions were HUGE. We could've fed at least 3 ppl with the food we received.  Service was great. The waiters weren't snobby at all, even though me and my bf were the youngest kids there. I was a little annoyed that they kept on referring to the Wagyu beef as Kobe...because its not the same thing. But the \"lead\" waiter even recommended a cheaper tasting menu that fit our tastes better, instead of recommending the more expensive one that would result in a bigger bill.  Why the one star off? I'd like to see a better appetizer in the tasting menu we got. Also, I really thought the food was good but our bill came out to $275 for two people (we split 3 glasses of champagne) which I thought was hefty for food that was plain in idea and execution and not super innovative or unique. I think if I paid Restaurant Week prices I'd be a little happier but all in all, we had a great meal.",

    "text": "The poor lighting was just another way of Tom Colicchio telling me that he knows more about fine dining than I do. The dim lighting offered a very rustic and warming ambiance. Dark woods and Edison-ion incandescent light bulbs created a mood that was more of a brew master's basement rather than Vegas Strip fine dining. The service of course was an obvious reminder that you pay top dollar for the best. The duet of servers we had were in tune with the menu as well as my near endless need for ice water while eating.  Though I have always enjoyed steak, I honestly acknowledge that to me good meat tastes like good meat and that great meat tastes like more expensive good meat. I'm happy to note that for once in my life I was proven wrong. The American-Kobe was literally perfect. The braised sauce was itself worth its weight in flavor and the meat was cooked to perfection. Of course the dim lighting may have hidden any imperfections in presentation, but I'm giving Tom the benefit of the doubt. I shared with my date the Flat Iron American Kobe and the Duck Confit.   Having never heard of Monkey Bread, seeing it on the dessert menu was a bit surprising. Never mind the fact that my date loves both monkeys and bread; I was quite curious myself to see what this was. Turns out, it's quite the dessert. Dusted with cinnamon and served piping hot, the bread looked much like a regular muffin. However once the eating takes place all muffin comparisons stop. It comes apart in chunks, which can be dipped in a caramel frosting which it is paired with. Its warm buttery taste alone is delicious, but as with most things in life; frosting takes it to another level.  Stuffed full and impressed enough to want to write about it, I happily paid my bill (which given its price, I would have not deemed worth it if it had not been one of the best places I've ever eaten at).",

I am a huge fan of \"Top Chef\" so it was a great surprise!  We sat at the bar having some drinks while we waited for our table. The martinis are wonderful and STRONG. Wow! The bartender was like an encyclopedia on whiskey and shared his wealth of knowledge with anyone sitting at the bar.   The menu is done ala carte, so be prepared for that. The bread they bring is probably the most amazing thing I've ever eaten in my life! Soft, gooey, salty, delicious!!!! The steak was PERFECT in every way. I had the asparagus as my side (delicious and perfectly seasoned). My boyfriend had the fingerling potatoes. Those weren't anything special, in my opinion.  The steak, by the way, was I believe 12 ounces. So you will definitely be FULL. We did not have room for dessert--which was very sad. :( The woman next to us got the surf and turf dish (the lobster looked amazing) and she also had the chocolate souffle. My only regret was that we didn't get dessert!  The restaurant was elegant and romantic and the service was impeccable. My favorite fancy restaurant in Vegas!",

MUCH to our delight, they have a special 'pre-show' meal that is MUCH cheaper than regular meals. It was 3 courses, and we chose to add wine pairings.   We began with cocktails prior to our appetizers. Then a lovely wine with a large variety of appetizers arrived. I was already feeling full, and tipsy, when our entree and next wine arrived. We could not finish everything and it was time to get to the show. It was an emergency! Food courses were left and we had to leave! What were these two foodies to do?   Our 'craftily' accommodating waiter came to the rescue! He bagged up our left overs and kept them in the kitchen while we went to the show. He invited us to return after the show to enjoy our desserts and final wines at the bar upon our return. How is THAT for great service?   When we returned, our waiter was swamped with other customers. He did not work the bar area. But, he came over to serve our desserts AND checked on us to make sure we were still happy before we finished. We had already paid our bill and tipped him before the show, so he could have totally been done with us. He really went above and beyond in the realm of customer service.   Great food, great service, BEAUTIFUL restaurant. You REALLY need to go here if you are in Vegas.",

    "text": "Hmm...I honestly think that Crafsteak is a bit overhyped on Yelp.   My boyfriend and I ordered the tasting menu this past weekend, and it was just allllllright. Potato puree (basically mashed potatoes), quail, and chocolate souffle dessert were the standouts and all very very good (the souffle AMAZINGLY so.) But for entrees, both types of steaks were just okay..scallops were pretty lousy. I've made better myself, and they were on the smallish side. You'd expect big juicy plump ones considering you only get TWO! Ironically, they serve you HUGE PORTIONS of everything else. It really is way too much food.   They focus on quantity over quality, for reals.  Other than the food, the service was great, and the ambiance is kinda cool...not what I was expecting though. If you're looking for a romantic/fancy steakhouse type of place for a date or special occasion...try somewhere else. I'd recommend Craftsteak for groups as their portions are HUGE and it's pretty casual and not pretentious at all.",

It is a bit expensive but we shared a dish so we shared the cost =D and the portion was big enough for 2 people.

It was $110 but I've never eaten a piece of meat like it. Just phenomenal. He got chicken, which was by far the best chicken I'd ever eaten, as well. We shared yukon gold potato puree and green beans. The beans were a bit salty, but that's the only compliant I have about the entire night.   The service was impeccable. We're only 21 and they didn't make us feel inferior or anything. It was obvious that we're young but it didn't matter. I'd never been served so well in my life.  The actual restaurant is beautiful. Dark, romantic ambience. We didn't have dessert or drinks. We looked at the dessert menu and it looked delicious but we were so full that there was no way we could fit it in!  My boyfriend paid so I don't know the exact total, but for two people, expect to pay well over $200, obviously depending on what you get. But please please please, if you have the money, DO experience Tom Coloccio's masterpiece of a restaurant. It was incredible!",

Our bartender was quick and courteous.  We were deciding between 2 things on the bar/appetizer menu and asked the bartender for a suggestion.  He said \"hands down, go with the Braised Beef Short Ribs, it's just ridiculous how good they are\".   The plate came with 2 short ribs (average size which isn't very big) and the sides on a separate plate.  The bartender puts the food in front of us and waits for us to take a bite...IT WAS AMAZING!...  I looked at the bartender smiled and said \"that is ridiculously good!\"  I would have to say this is some of the best flavor I have ever had. It came with 2 sides, we got Yukon Gold Potato Puree and Fries, both were ok (it also came with a basket of bread).    The ribs and 2 sides were $17, you don't get a lot but for me it was worth it for the taste.  The regular dinner menu is very expensive.  Maybe will come try it if I ever have a good night at the tables.  But we will definitely be coming here every trip for an appetizer.",

While it was very interesting for everyone to be able to compare the different cuts, we all agreed that the Skirt Steak was the best.  This ain't yo momma's skirt steak. Trust me.  For the amount of money we dropped on a party of 4, it was extremely pricey.  But the meal was great.  The service on the other hand was disappointing.  No different than Maggiano's or PF Chang's.  For a $1600 check, that just doesn't cut it.  We also got stuck at a table in the bar, which I did not enjoy.  Definately ask for a table in the dining room.  Finally, the Warm Frisee salad was spectacular!  I am still giving this 4-stars because the food was that good, and my guests thoroughly enjoyed it.",

    "text": "You want to be hypercritical of the place, given the scathing remarks Colicchio throws at the Top Chef contestants.  But then you realize he's the head judge for a reason.  Craftsteak was a precision performance, reminiscent of the Blue Angels, executed expertly from beginning to end.  The hostess was able to accommodate our last second switch from party of two to party of four.  No problem.  No delay.  It was as if they were expecting it.  The table had already been set for four.  Our waiter and his assistant (Eric and Franciscio--how often do you remember the names?) were top notch, ensuring us a well timed courses.  Our water glasses never approached empty.  Details.  Our group decided on the special prix-fixe/tasting menu they happened to be offering.  For $75 per person ($105 with three wine pairings), we were treated to family style service of a variety of fantastic dishes.  The starter was a lobster bisque, which was superb.  I'm not exactly sure what the seasoning was, but it might have been saffron, and just enough of a hint at that.  There were just enough pieces of lobster so that it was not too heavy as a starter.  Delicious.  The next course included Caesar salad, roasted peppers, and prosciutto.  Yum, yum, and yum.  We knew by then that we were in for something special.  Main dishes:  Sliced Kobe sirloins, a marinated skirt steak, seared scallops, with sides of sweet potato puree, fried artichokes, and creamed spinach.  This is where we turned into savages, ate with our hands, and communicated in snorts and groans.  Everything was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, portioned perfectly.  I cannot tell you what the four dessert samplings were.  I remember them being brought to the table.  I remember they looked nice.  I remember spoons.  Chocolates, creams, fruits.  It's all a dream to me now.  Colicchio mentioned the importance of a good dessert on last night's episode (restaurant wars) and I now know that he is a man of his word.  You might balk at spending $210 for two people for a \"tasting\" menu, but you definitely get your money's worth with this menu.  There was more than enough food to go around.  This will go down as one of the great dining experiences of my life.  As I lay in bed later that night, the best kind of indigestion interrupting my sleep, I thought about how difficult it must be to achieve this level of perfection.  And I thought, you poor, poor Top Chef contestants--good luck to you!",

We ordered the Wagyu beef dinner for the table where you all pay a flat fee and they bring every imaginable cut of Wagyu beef (strip, filet, skirt steak, etc) along with appetizers, side dishes, and desserts. In fact, they brought ALL of the sides.   My favorite sides were the Mushroom risotto and the sweet corn, damn those were good. The meat though was so damn succulent and tasty you won't get a better batch of steaks anywhere.   By the time dessert came around we were really full, but they brought us 2 of everything. My favorite was the vanilla bean cheesecake and the bear claw things.   All in all +5 for the taste of the food. Amazing.  -1 for the price. You go in knowing it is going to be expensive... but, they charge you a 50 dollar \"large group fee\", make you pay a $500 deposit, and a mandatory 20% tip.  Not including drinks, it was about 200 bucks for dinner.",

Both my servers were very informed on the menu items and had good insights on the dishes I asked about.   I had the warm frisee salad which was great, and had chunks of bacon and a soft egg white on top. They were able to portion down the starters and sides since it was just me.  The potato puree is rich potatoey goodness with chives.   The star of the show was the Wagyu ribeye. Maybe the best steak I have ever had   Every bite was the perfect bite of meaty, grilled goodness.  You pay a huge premium, but there is a difference.  They don't offer grass fed beef, because according to him the majority of their diners don't even care or know the difference.   I enjoyed the roasted shallot that came with the steak and The roasted maui onions are sweet and a great complement to your steak.",

And if you're going to get Wagyu, go to Craftsteak and get the Chef's Wagyu Beef Selection. This is the best value for Wagyu beef and you won't regret it. You are permitted to request and substitute as you wish. Just make sure you go in with an appetite. Service was impeccable and easily five stars from Eric and his team.  I went with two other hungry buddies and had three amazing courses, all five stars. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation on a Friday night and we were seated immediately.   Drinks: complimentary champagne (thank you), 18 year Jameson, and $45 wine flight with chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, and tokaji.   Appetizers: dinner rolls, frisee salad, shrimp cocktail, heirloom tomatoes, and buffalo mozzarella.   Entrees: Wagyu filet, Wagyu skirt steak, and Wagyu strip with potato puree, roasted peppers, and Brentwood sweet corn as sides.   Desserts: Monkey bread, carrot cake, blueberry creme brulee, fruit plate, sorbet assortment, and after dinner chocolate brownie/cake.  With all that food, the beef was still the star. I would do it again in a second and would recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves beef.",

    "text": "Ever since I started watching Top Chef on Bravo, I've been dying to try one of Tom Colicchio's restaurants, and even though I live in LA, I haven't had a chance to try the one closer to home.  So, I was super excited to try Craftsteak with my friend.  The service was impeccable.  Our server gave us his recommendations on the menu and since it was our first time at the restaurant, he suggested we try the Chef's Beef Selection Tasting Menu.  It was such a great value, and it allowed us to try smaller portions of several of their dishes.    We opted to try their Avocado salad (delicious!!!), Italian Buffalo Mozzarella salad (would be fantastic as a caprese salad!), Lobster Bisque Soup (it was only mediocre in my opinion), 1/2 dozen raw oysters- we had the kumamoto and miyage oysters which were fresh and delicious).  For the sides, we ordered the mushroom assortment, fingerling potatoes, and potato puree.  Everything tasted amazing.  The sea salt buns with butter they give you complimentary are to die for.    For our main entree, I ordered the grilled Ribeye medium rare, and my friend ordered the roasted New York Strip medium.  Here is where everything went downhill unfortunately.  The steak was TERRIBLE.  I have eaten at a lot of steakhouses, and eaten a lot of steaks in my lifetime.  This is by far one of the WORST steaks I've had at a fine dining restaurant.  First of all, instead of bringing out a roasted New York Strip, a grilled New York Strip steak came out.  My friend opted not to return the dish because she didn't want to waste food.  The steak came out on a hot dish, sliced off the bone and covered in I believe a bourguignonne sauce.  It looked beautiful, but the steaks were SO TOUGH and tasted so bland.  When I looked at a slice of the steak, it had no marbling and no fat whatsoever.  The sauce didn't taste particularly good, and the server never mentioned that the steak even came with a sauce drizzled on top of it.    We ended the meal with an assortment of desserts which were also delicious.  It included monkey bread with a side of sour cream and brown sugar ice cream (it was too sour for me-- tasted weird), a chocolate tart, coconut ice cream (so good!), passion fruit sorbet, and a fruit plate.  It was so unfortunate that everything BUT the steak was delicious, considering it's a steakhouse.  Would not recommend for steak and I want to love this restaurant so much, but how can you go to a steakhouse to eat everything EXCEPT for the steak?    Service- 5 stars Salad/Appetizers/Sides- 5 stars Dessert- 4 stars Ambiance- 5 stars Steak- 1 star :(",

Our waiter was absolutely accommodating and great, giving us a better quality meat, but by the time it came out, the wine was gone and the sides were cold. We still paid the price of the initial inedible cut. When you are spending 400+/couple, you expect better execution of the evening than we experienced. Unfortunately very disappointed and I almost never say that about a dining experience.",

We ordered 6 of the sides and the asparagus was other worldly with a nice spice. The wine was over-priced but that occurs everywhere. Our waiters were friendly and attentive. The oysters as appetizers were very tasty (and I am picky).",

My boyfriend and I decided to eat wingstop because I have never had it and he had nothing but amazing things to say about their food, service, etc. We ordered our food and the \"manager\" by the name of Jamilett read us our order back. We ordered 10 wings all flat combo, half original hot and the other half lemon pepper. The other order was 8 boneless with a mix of original hot and bbq. It was correct. We waited about 20 minutes for our food. We get all the way home just to look in the bag to the order being completely wrong. I immediately called the location and spoke to the \"manager\" once again. She embodied no compassion, nor empathy for our order not being correct. She proceeded to say that she will replace the 5 wings that were supposed to be lemon pepper and re-make the boneless order. By the time we would have waited for that to be re-made, the rest of our food would have been super cold. I explained that to her. Once again, she could careless. She told us that she would not replace nothing else besides what they messed up. By then, I said I'd much rather get a refund and patronize another business instead. My boyfriend and I get back to the location just to be greeted with attitude by the \"manager\". She told us that she will not give us a refund, nor re-make our food. Highly disappointed by the lack there of compassion. If possible, stay far far away!",

There're also beautiful, colorful, lively, fun paintings of cows -- yes, cows -- on the walls over the booths.  The staff is outstanding -- friendly, patient, helpful, knowledgeable, and efficient.  The menu is surprisingly large (I rarely see a menu this size at a place categorized as \"fine dining\"), as are the portions -- you won't go hungry here without trying, especially if you have a party of four or less and go with the family style option...sooooo much excellent food!  The food has great flavor, especially the meats (of course) and, surprisingly, the bibb salad, which had a light blue-cheese dressing that brought the components together perfectly.  The drinks list is HUGE, with especially extensive wine and scotch sections.  My one issue with Craftsteak is that I felt like it was very overpriced -- even though the quality is excellent -- especially the drinks.  (I knew the bottle prices of a few of the scotches on the list and the markup on a glass seemed ridiculously high to me.)",

    "text": "Took my man here for his bday last Friday night. Well, he paid, so technically he took me. When I made the rezzies I asked for an intimate table, and I was so happy with the very private booth they gave us.   We decided on the Winter Tasting menu since we wanted a lot of different tastes (and it's a good deal for this place, at $60 a person). You can add a wine pairing for an additional $30 a head, but we're not big wine drinkers.   I added the Lobster Bisque because it's one of my fave soups ever, and it didn't disappoint. $18 gets you a big tureen of it, with luscious chunks of lobster meat too. Soooooo good. They also bring you a hot pan of pull-apart buns that are super yummy. The starters were okay, he loved the quail, and the roasted red peppers were to die for. Neither of us like beets, so that dish was lost on us, and the mixed greens are precisely that- a plate of mixed greens, rather plain.   Next we got Flat Iron Steak, Skirt Steak, and Scallops. If I had known that the scallops would be the best I've ever tasted, I would have just ordered a plate of them! The steak was meh, good quality but plain. The sides we got were forgettable, except for the Pureed Yukon Gold Potatoes. We practically licked the pot they came in!   By dessert I was ready to explode, but I did try the chocolate cake. It had a crunchy shell filled with pure melted chocolate! The home style pistachio ice cream on the side was also heavenly. They also brought us a cheesecake which I am told was wonderful.  To sum it up: get the Lobster Bisque, Diver Sea Scallops, and Yukon Golds, followed by the Chocolate Cake.   Service was excellent, which you'd expect from a higher end place. 4 stars instead of 5 because the steaks were so boring for a steakhouse!",

    "text": "I'd like to preface this with the fact that I think Vegas Restaurant Week is great, we get to experience all these awesome restaurants without breaking our bank (as much).  That said, we went to Craftsteak during restaurant week. When we told them we were there for Restaurant Week (a group of 8) tried to give our order the waiter told us there was no need.  Apparently at Craftsteak, Restaurant Week meals are served family-style, so that everyone can try every dish.  For $50 a person, the dishes were as follows:  First Course  Appetizers  Shaved Fennel, Lemon, Olive Oil Vermont Farm Quail, Quince Saba Italian Buffalo Mozzarella, Hazelnuts Persian Cucumber, Watercress, Ginger  Second Course  Entrees  Grilled Angus Skirt Steak Prime Beef Flat Iron Diver Sea Scallops, Lemon Vinaigrette  Side Dishes  Brentwood Sweet Corn, Green Onions Organic Baby Shiitake Mushrooms Yukon Gold Potato Puree, Chives  Third Course  Dessert Pastry Chef's Selection of Confections, Ice Cream and Sorbet  One of stars for the night was definitely the quail, which was succulent and sweet and came with some delicious almost candied grapes... I heard the scallops were the most awesome of the three entrees (unfortunately I didn't have any).     Number one for me, though were all of the side dishes.  The potato puree, the corn and the mushrooms were all amazing.  Those were finished off even before th entrees were.    As far as the desserts go, they were surprisingly good. (I'm generally disappointed with fixe-prixe desserts).  We had a butterscotch cinnamon roll type pastry, 4 flavors of ice cream/sorbet, creme brulee and a molten chocolate cake.  The chocolate cake was on the dry side, but all of the other desserts were delicious.    All-in-all I give this restaurant 4 stars, not because it wasn't super awesome, but I feel that if I had the choice there are a few restaurants I would probably choose to go to over craftsteak for the price point.",

Made reservations and got seated immediately.  Started off with some of their homemade bread. My bf was raving to me about their bread here. I tried to resist the bread since I didn't want to fill my stomach all awhile he was eating 3 already, not to mention we ordered extra bread to-go!! Haha! Next up were oysters that were SO FRESH me and my bf's eyes both lit up both thinking and saying \"this is the best oyster i've ever eaten in my life!!!\" the sauces-horseradish, cocktail sauce, and some red vinegar onion which i think was the best compliment to the oysters were so so amazing!!!! Ordered the Australian Wagyu steak and the Lobster as well as the pureed potatoes and maui onions to compliment our dish. Steak was the best steak i had in my life thus far.It better be if its $300!  Although quite small in size compare to bigger steaks on the menu, it was perfect for us to share along with the lobster. The lobster came in a mini copper pot in which i believe there were 2 lobsters cut into easy to eat chunks soaking in a buttery sauce.   The pureed potatoes were so creamy and delicate tasting. Usually if you were to mash or puree the potatoes too much it will become pasty and gummy but they got the science right on making the perfect \"pureed\" potatoes! I would love to eat this if i got my wisdom tooth out was the first thought in my head. LOL The grilled maui onions were perfect compliment to the meal. Maui onions are sweet. They were cut in thick slices, grilled with a sprig of rosemary on top. The rosmeary complimented the onions so well, I will also start doing that in my home cooking.   Overall it was a delicious dining experience. I'd like to try Nobhill Tavern next as my bf's sister thinks their steaks are better! ?   I found it funny-maybe it is normal for a fancy restaurant? but when my bf went to use the restroom, he left his napkin crumbled on the table. A waiter came by out of nowhere and folded his napkin neatly not paying attention as if i was there or not and went on his way. I was sitting there by myself giggling for some reason...",

So my husband is a chef and we live in San Francisco, so I guess we are pretty spoiled with really great food. And how excited was I when my husband told me he made reservations at Tom Colicchio's  restaurant!   As soon as we walked in my husband wanted to leave. I thought it was a bit rude since we had reservations on a Sat night. So we compromised and just shared a couple of things. Guess I should have listened to him! We ordered the 10 oz Filet. The cut and quality of the meat was great. But wait? Where was the flavor. Even just a bit of salt would have made it better. I was tempted to ask for steak sauce just so there was some sort of flavor.  We also had the Frisee Salad which was recommended by the waiter, it was pretty tasty. For our sides we had the potato gratin and Israeli Artichokes. Once again, WHERE IS THE FLAVOR?? I believe the artichoke was deep fried, ugh, WHY?  The drinks from the bar were great, service was ehh. Nothing impressive at all.   If I've gone to a reputable steak house and the only thing that stood out was  a salad, something is terribly wrong here people!   What a waste of money!!",

    "text": "As I'm writing this, I'm still hovering between 3 and 4 stars. I feel that I might be a bit picky, but it's only because I was expecting to be completely blown away. Granted, my experience was great and my partner and I really enjoyed ourselves, but there were a few little things which irked me the wrong way. Full disclosure, our visit was December 8, 2012; just being clear that I didn't JUST visit. Anyway, moving on...  My partner and I had a very early dinner reservation, owing to it being a) a Saturday night, b) the weekend smack-dab in the middle of the National Rodeo Finals, and c) the same night as the Pacquiao/Marquez fight. Needless to say, it was packed. In the end, we were glad for the early reservation because it allowed us plenty of time to eat our meal without feeling rushed for our show later that evening. When we first walked by the \"outside\" (I put it in quotes because nothing in Vegas has a real exterior unless it's a casino), I was worried it was going to be tiny. What I saw from outside, though, was merely the bar/lounge. Once inside, the place is huge. The decor and lighting is very smart and even though the tables are placed quite close to one another, you still feel you can have a nice conversation with whoever is with you.  My partner and I began the evening with a sampling of their fresh oysters. Presented with a red wine minuet, freshly grated horseradish, and (if I recall correctly) house-made cocktail sauce. Oysters were incredibly fresh and flavorful. We then each had a salad: the Caesar and the Arugula. Both were delicious, but they were both HUGE. I swear there was at least half a box of arugula in my salad bowl. I ended up leaving much of the salad behind, as I was afraid of filling up before my steak arrived.   Ah, the steaks... This is where I think Craftsteak really excelled (and good thing, too, given the name). I ordered the Petite Fillet. Although far from petite at 10 oz, it was a lovely and tender cut of beef and roasted to perfection. It was neither too rare or overdone, which is difficult with a steak as thick as fillet tends to be. It really did melt in my mouth. The presentation with a roasted shallot was just right. My partner went with the 10 oz Hangar steak. His steak was also cooked to perfection and was absolutely delicious. We shared two sides: Heirloom Cauliflower with Garlic Confit and French Fries with Roasted Paprika and Sherry Vinegar. The sides were excellent, as well, the french fries, in particular, being the star of the table: perfectly cooked and spicy and savory from the roasted paprika and vinegar. I felt the cauliflower, while still delicious, seemed too rich.   We ended our meal simply with 2 scoops of ice cream: 1 mint chocolate chip and 1 vanilla bean, both house-made. The vanilla bean ice cream was incredibly creamy and rich, without being too sweet. The mint chocolate chip, on the other hand, was disappointing. Instead of peppermint, fresh spearmint was used for the mint cream, instead, giving it a weedy aftertaste (imagine chewing on a leaf of fresh mint for too long). We did enjoy our dessert, even if it didn't really live up as much to the rest of the meal.   As for drinks, my partner and I both ordered martinis: 1 with Junipero Gin and olives, the other Grey Goose with a twist. It should be noted that both martinis came with olives, even though one was specified to come with a twist. My partner did not send his back, though. The martinis were generous to say the least. The \"extra\" was provided on the side in a tiny individual shaker and after the refill ended up being the equivalent to 2 full martinis. The wine list is extensive and also INCREDIBLY expensive. There was no note of a corkage fee, but even if it's the more standard $25, it's worth it to bring your own bottle. There were only 2 or 3 full-sized bottles priced less than $80, with the majority of the list above $100. Stick with cocktails or bring your own, unless you want to pay handily for wines you can find at Bevmo for half their menu price. Nonetheless, we found a fine bottle of California Pinot Noir for our meal.  So, here comes the nit-picky part. Perhaps due to the packed house they had that night, our waiter frequently changed. It seemed there was staff members everywhere, running this way and that. It was a little distracting. The waiter who greeted us when we first sat down, was not the waiter who handed our check in the end. There was no hand-off done and no introduction to our new waitress. Instead, it changed and that was that. Overall, the portions could be scaled down a bit. I simply cannot eat 10 ounces of meat, which is the smallest steak size they offer, and since we were merely visiting, I couldn't take the leftovers to go. I know Vegas is all about \"go big or go home,\" but I hate wasting food, too.  Overall, though, a great experience. We're happy we came. Truly a top-notch steakhouse.",

Portions were served family style and a lot of it, veg was awesome and who knew so many types of beets existed.  Meat was well prepared and they signature spare rib was fall apart wonderful.  Next time I will go and get the Kobe tasting menu.  Wait staff was good however we did find our group pouring our wine more often.",

Thankfully we were getting a meal on the MGM so we had to go to a restaurant owned by the MGM...Craftsteak was the restaurant of choice.  Service was okay but don't really like being seated in the area that looks like it's the bar lounge as opposed to being seated in the actual restaurant.  The tables for some reason made us feel like we were sitting miles away from each other but it was just a round table...strange!  Menu is a bit weird but we ordered fine enough with the waitresses help.  Food was good but didn't like the fact that the steak came in this skillet that was placed on a plate that's not flat.  Try easily cutting a steak when the surface is not sturdy, not nice!!  Asparagus was good and the wine was complimentary.  They didn't rush us out which was nice but we were too tired to stay anyway...nice restaurant, good food, good service, but for some reason...not sure I'd come back...not the greatest vibe I guess...",

We got the Ka show and dinner menu with the wine pairing ($20 extra per). There was so much food, to be shared family style, that we couldn't finish it all( a first). The chicken was a little overcooked, but the rest of the meal made up for it.  My GF usually hates scallops, but their seadive scallops won her over. \"I never knew they could taste like this\" was her exclamation. In short, the dishes were delicious.  The decor was warm and inviting.  The service was on point, very helpful. I will definitely eat here again when in Vegas. Thank you Chef!",

    "text": "Good, but not great...  Sloppiness in the kitchen prevented this from being a better review than it is, but if the kitchen can make mistakes like these, I have serious questions about how good they are.  We all had salads for our first course:  - The Caesar was enough for two, but the dressing was boring to say the least.  No brightness of any sort.  - The baby beets were good, though again the dressing was much understated - that is to say, mostly olive oil.  - The arugula was fine, but again nothing special.  - The roasted red peppers were fine, though oily.  As for mains:  - The New York strip was cooked perfectly, but was served a little above room temperature.  I would have sent it back, but figured that if I did so, I'd be getting my steak while everyone else was having dessert.  - The filet we had at the table was excellent.  However, the portion was huge.  - The flat iron steak was a bit small and not cooked medium well as requested, but the taste was excellent.  - The grilled salmon was cooked properly and was deemed to be wonderful.  Sides:  - Asparagus - grilled to death and greasy  - uck!  - Brussels Sprouts - what can you say about food cooked with bacon - yummy - if not a bit greasy.  (We ate all of them.)  - Potatoes - we ordered Fingerlings but got whipped Yukon Gold.  (We didn't request a change since it was not worth worrying about.)  The whipped potatoes had enough butter and cream in them to clog the arteries of the people at the table next to ours.  Consistency was a bit too much like baby food for us, but they were very good.  Desserts:  - Ice cream - not much to say about that  - Monkey bread - very good, but very rich  - Banana brioche bread pudding - okay - I'm still waiting for the taste of the banana.  For the price of the meal, the portions were very generous.  All of the sides were big enough for generous helpings for two or three people.  However, the fact that the kitchen sent out a cold steak and grossly overcooked asparagus gives me more than ample cause for concern.  All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  All-in-all, a very good value for the money, but the kitchen needs to clean up their act.  I would give them a second chance, but having been to other steak houses in Vegas, it would be a hard sell, since we know of better choices with more professional kitchens and exceptional service.",

The malbec didn't go with the meal as well as I had hoped it would, but I forgot how hard that can be to pair with food.  I didn't realize the sides would be as salty as they were.  That meal needed something like a pinot noir.   My wife had the sea scallops and she absolutely loved them.  The staff recommended the monkey bread for dessert, and they sure were right on that one.  I paired it with a glass of madeira, and that was a homerun.  I got that one right, anyway.  I would give this place 4 1/2 stars if it let me.  I can't give it five, though.  It is a great dining experience.  Next time, I am going to splurge on that Kobe skirt steak.",

She treated us like we were in a diner ten minutes before closing.  I ordered a foie gras appetizer and it was inedible. The texture was awful and the flavor was worse.  So, why the four star rating? KOBE BEEF. If you really want to eat real Kobe, this is the place to do it. If you want excellent service and consistent food, keep looking.",

You really knew how to push my meaty buttons!  Besides the main dish, I have to say the Yukon Gold potato puree made me \"puree\" in my pants (the good kind not THAT kind).  I'm not sure what it was but that chef knew exactly how to upgrade regular mashed potatoes into something that left me craving more.  I'm wiping off the drool as we speak!  To end it all, my date and I were served mini shortbread cookies and coffee-flavored white chocolate morsels.  I was too full to eat the cookies but the coffee white chocolate pieces were to die for!  I'll definitely be going back during my next Vegas excursion!",

(which was very noisy and had people constantly rushing by) Finally, they seated us in the main dinning area, and I noticed plenty of tables opened. For the prices they charge here, that is really unacceptable!  Service was slow, so so sooooooo sssssslow. Gosh! The lobster basque was ok. The steaks were average at the most. The only thing that really stood out was the bread.   Oh, also, if you wanted to have a quiet romantic evening, this is NOT the place to go at all. There are so many large tables everywhere, which made the place looked like a large food court.   I guess it's perfect for large groups of drunken folks since they probably wouldn't be able to notice the slow service or bland food.",

Kevin explained the menu and made helpful suggestions. Gave us some time to look over menu then came back to see if we had any questions and yes we did and he went over it again with us.   We took his suggestion and ordered like a tasting menu. My gf and I each ordered our entree's, she had the t-bone and I chose the 24 hr braised short rib. Then three salads, Italian buffalo mozzarella, Caeser's salad then we were stuck and Kevin suggested the warm frisee salad w/ bacon. Then our sides were mashed potatoes, fries and then we were stuck again and Keven suggested brussel sprouts w/bacon. Oh yeah our dinners also came with lobster bisque to start and a pan of bread!  Everything we ordered was delicious! Kevin's suggestions were right on! 24 hour braised beef was tasty and soo tender!   I wondered why they didn't ask us what we wanted for dessert, then they brought 4 different plates and it was all for us!! Fresh mixed fruits, a scoop of ice cream and a scoop of sorbet, sticky bun w/ a scoop of coffee ice cream and a strip of lemon and a strip of pineapple cake or bread with some kind of cream topping. Everything again was soo good!  Again I can't stress enough about the service! Kevin you are the BEST! You and Olga make a great team! We will be back on our next trip!",

Food should not cost that much money and there was so much of it there were 2 huge bags of leftovers.

I like the ambiance of the restaurant - it is not a \"stuffy\" steakhouse.  The wine list is a bit overwhelming, it's like a phone book!  However, if you can't find a wine to suit your taste and/or budget, you are doing something wrong.  There is definitely something for everyone on that list!  They also have a pretty impressive scotch selection, if that's what your preference is.    My favorite thing to do is to order the tasting menu.  It is usually reasonably priced, considering the amount of food you get, and it is a great selection of the menu items.  Additionally, it is always WAY more food than any human should/could eat in one sitting.  I've never left without a doggie bag!  Summer is the best season - it's corn season!  They seriously have a countdown to when the corn is added to the menu.  As silly as that sounds, the corn has a serious following!  It usually arrives around June....I can't explain what makes it so delicious, but trust me, you'll want to try it.  Everything I've ever had has been amazing.  From steaks to chops to seafood, Tom Colicchio's crew has it down to a science!    This place can be VERY busy.  If it is a holiday or event weekend, you will need reservations for sure.  If it is a slower, off-peak weeknight, I would still suggest making a reservation and being on time.  If you aren't able to get a reservation, the lounge area is first come, first serve.  A trip to Vegas is not complete without a stop at Craftsteak!",

His helper and the busboy were the only ones semi-paying attention to us and that's even with us ordering 4 of the $160/ea surf and turf tasting deals.   Well, 4 stars for the beef, lobster, potato puree and risotto cooked with chunks of pork.   Beef (Domestic Wagyu): One of the best beef flavors and texture I've ever tasted. I was totally mesmerized with each bite. They serve the Flank, Rib-Eye, and NY Strip. The Flank was my favorite. Just incredible Wagyu Beef!   Lobster (about 1 lb for ea person): This was cook al dente. Some people might think it's under cooked but it's not. Al dente lobster has the perfect texture and has that great lobster taste you can't beat. But here, even though I loved the lobster, the Wagyu beef was the superstar.   Potato Puree (Yukon Gold): Buttery and creamy; the best potato puree I've had. This is a must side dish because the buttery taste matches very well with the beef or the lobster.   Risotto: It has stringy chucks of pork in it. Savory and the right amount of moister. They have this side dish down to a science.   The rest of the side dishes, starters and some of the deserts were just ok. Something I can make at home by going to my local Von's for some basic ingredients.   PLEASE BE AWARE!!! If you have any left overs and you want them wrapped up for you to take home, make TRIPLE SURE the busboy confirms he will. We had a lot of expensive left orders and my brother-in-law and I told the same busboy we wanted to take them home. He threw it all away and said we didn't tell him anything. They semi made up for it but boy was I pissed and it kind of gave me a sour stomach.  p.s. the seats in the booths are of suede but are very worn and feel as there is food crumbs.",

I'm a fan of Top Chef and had been wanting to try Tom Colicchio's restaurant for a while, so I was happy to see that I was able to get an early reservation with no problem.  Since I was flying solo that night, I decided to just sit at the bar rather than a table.  The bartender was very attentive and helpful when I had trouble deciding on which beer to order.  For my meal, I had a craving for both steak and scallops.  Unfortunately the only combo they offered with these two had a filet for the steak choice, but I was in more of a rib-eye mood that evening.  Not to fear though, as the bartender pointed me towards a scallops appetizer which paired nicely with my steak.  I ended up ordering the following, all of which were fantastic:  - Lobster Bisque - Rich, creamy goodness.  I've had some good lobster bisque in my days, but this was damn near amazing.  Well worth the calories. - Scallops - Ordered from the appetizer menu, this included 4 delicious scallops that was a perfect compliment to my steak  - Rib-eye - Ordered medium rare, it was grilled to perfection with just he right amount of marbling.   I was too full to even think about dessert, so I can't comment on that.  The above order plus a couple beers came out to about $125.  For one of the better meals I've had, it was well worth the price.  I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.",

For sides we loved the potato puree, roasted Brussels sprouts, and Bibb salad.  We also ordered the roasted butternut squash but had to send it back as half of it was completely undercooked. We also enjoyed two desserts - the baked souffle and the kind of \"deconstructed\" creme brulee... to die for!   It was pricey, but worth what we paid.  Would I go back?

I love bread but I usually get full off the bread basket from eating one to many rolls! lol  Hand Cut Waygu Tartare- I think I like eating my meat raw. Less chewy but full of flavor. The waygu was tender and great on the crostini.   Porterhouse- I'll be honest, I only had to pieces because I was so full from the bread and waygu tartare. I cant figure out what makes meat good. It wasn't chewy, the meat was tender and had alot of flavor. My Boyfriend ended up finishing most of it.   Potato Gratin- creamy, but on the heavy side of coarse. I would probably recommend getting a veggie dish.   Risotto- My boyfriend loves risotto, however he would agree I make the best risotto. Craftsteak risotto was very heavy and I didnt like the gritty texture.   No dinner is complete without Dessert! We got the Earl Grey Ice Cream and Strawberry Ice Cream- I love Earl Grey ice cream, its one of my favorite flavor. As well as Lavender.   Overall food was great, but it not a place i would come every year. I feel like there are a ton of different steak options in Vegas.",

    "text": "We ran all the way from the Cosmopolitan to the MGM to make their 10:30 deadline to get seated. Needless to say we were craving steak in the worst kind of way and figured it was prudent since we were going to Hakkasan right after anyways.  We made it right at 10:30 and the hostesses at the front didn't look too pleased by our arrival but you can bet I'm not letting some 20-something wannabe-diva ruin my dinner. We had to sit at the bar but that was fine by us. Quickly scanned the menu and we went straight for the bone-in ribeye and bone-in sirloin, cause as we all know, bone-in is just better, wink wink.  We went to grab a better at Michael Mina's Pub 1842 a couple doors down while we waited for the steaks to arrive, it was buy-one-get-one-free PBR's with a Yelp check-in deal and I sure wasn't going to pass that up.  Steaks came served on copper pans which was a nice touch, the sirloin exhibited a rich beefy flavor, aged somewhere between 22-28 days I believe and was good but I definitely preferred the rib-eye. Fat should be considered a flavor and the 18oz slab of prime corn-fed cow had a sumptuous charred crust and decadently tender pink center. The mushrooms that we had for a side were good, but not $24 for a small dish good. In general, I thought all the sides were over-priced, but I understand it's Vegas, it comes with the territory.  Craftsteak delivered an overall excellent meal, it was at least a memorable experience that satisfied our carnal needs and perhaps even squeezing into my top 5 of steak joints, kind of hard to beat my $10 prime rib-eye from Costco and my trusty backyard grill though.",

    "text": "Let me start off first with how excellent the service was that we received.  Our server's name was Kevin, and he also had a helper named Olga. He was honest, funny, and made me and my boyfriend feel comfortable dining at Craftsteak.  It was my boyfriends birthday weekend in Vegas and I reserved a table at Craftsteak. I had to change our reservation 3 times because we were running late but they were still very kind on the phone and had no problem with it. The interior atmosphere was amazing. It gave off a very calm and serene feeling with warm accents. It was not too loud, and we were seated in a round booth that had privacy on both sides while still being able to look out at most of the restaurant. The restaurant is actually a lot bigger than it seems from the outside. We were seated and I asked for recommendations on the wine and Kevin was very knowledgeable throughout the entire dinner, giving us suggestions that went with what we liked and had already ordered. My boyfriend ordered the Big Reds of Cali which included Brothers Ridge, Ladera, and Stuhlmmuller Vineyards which was 60$ total for all three glasses. The wine was delicious and they poured a good amount.  We ended up getting the pre-fixed meal of $140 per person for the Domestic Wagyu beef selections. Within the meal we were each given a cup of lobster bisque soup, allowed to pick 3 half order salads, 2 different Wagyu beefs, 3 half order side dishes, and a variety dessert. For salads, we chose the Handcut Wagyu Tartare which was AMAZING, the Prosciutto, and the Persian Cucumber salad. For the sides, we got the Potato Puree which was very creamy and flavorful, Assorted Mushrooms, and Asparagus. For the meats, we got the 10 oz. Wagyu Filet rare and 14 oz Wagyu Ribeye medium rare. The steaks were already cut, which probably made it cool off faster, but we thought that it was still delicious. It came out the perfect temperature on a skillet. For dessert we were given the Cinnamon Monkey Bread [with a nicely written happy birthday on it], a scoop of Cranberry Buttermilk Sorbet, and Banana Rum Ice cream, White Chocolate Cheesecake (my favorite), and an assortment of Farmers Market Fruit.  Throughout the whole time we were ordering, Kevin kept giving helpful suggestions to what we liked that made us feel like he truly wanted us to have a great dining experience. For example we wanted the tartare, the prosciutto, and my boyfriend wanted to try the warm frisee, which had bacon in it. Kevin wisely told us maybe we should go with a Persian cucumber salad to balance out how many different types of meats we would be eating. Turns out his years of working there had paid off and it was the right choice to go. He also recommended the well known potato puree, and when I asked about the Maui Onions, he immediately said you dont want to get that because your meal already comes with onions on the side. Wonderful! Most servers wouldnt even let you know that.. And finally the funniest part was when he said to make some sliders with the bread rolls by assuring us that putting in the meat and some potato puree, we would undoubtedly melt in our seats because of how amazing it tastes. This surely happened..  It was by far one of the best steakhouses we have ever been to with excellent service, and absolutely worth the money. I would recommend getting the prefixed meal because the quality of the food most definitely amounts to what you pay for it.The only problem is, it was pretty difficult for us to finish all that food. We tried to eat all of the steak because we knew it probably wouldn't taste as good to go, but we ended up taking a lot of the sides to go. Kevin even gave us 6 more fresh rolls of the bread to go! We probably died and went to heaven eating at Craftsteak and will most certainly without a doubt come back again.",

    "text": "First off, I can't believe I just got scooped in Vegan reporting by Becky M., who posted her review a couple of days ago.  I am shamed.  I went to Craftsteak when my meat-loving friend was in town celebrating her b-day, and agreed to check out what a steakhouse could do for a vegan.  I called to confirm that they could hook me up, and they totally came through!  We suspected that they'd be able to do something, considering that Tom gave the Top Chefs the challenge of cooking a vegetarian dinner.... but I was super impressed with the wide variety of options.  I started with the Persian cucumber salad with watercress and ginger dressing.  Delish! Very fresh and crisp and vegan without any modifications.  Also tried the vegan roasted red pepper with sliced garlic appetizer.  Simple but the flavors paired very well.    For my dinner, they created a plate of mixed veggie sides (there are about 40 veggie sides - some are vegan, some vegetarian, and some have meat bits in them).  I had broccolini (even the meat eaters were swooning over this), sauteed spinach, grilled asparagus, grilled sweet corn niblets, chanterelle mushrooms, and fried Jerusalem artichokes.  Everything was done very well, and I got way more food than I could eat for ~$34.  I would totally suggest having someone at the table order this even if you do eat meat just so you can try a variety of sides.  Because the sides are HUGE.  Definitely enough for 2-3 people to share.    I was even able to have dessert - chocolate sorbet -- it was creamy and delicious and not too heavy after a giant dinner.  I was very impressed with the staff's understanding of the vegan diet and was surprised to hear that I was the 3rd vegan there that night! So despite what people have said in reviews below, you SHOULD go here if you're vegan or vegetarian.  Everything was pretty reasonably priced considering the size of the dishes and the fact that it's the Strip.  We had 3 salads, my vegan plate, two meat entrees + two sides, 3 desserts and multiple cocktails and our bill was around $350 (thanks to Becky, who was my sugar momma that night!).",

    "text": "Overall, an okay experience. I was really torn trying to decide which of the many steakhouses in Las Vegas to visit. I think on my next trip though, I probably will not make a stop at Craftsteak. The food is definitely good, but not quite on par with other steakhouses in the area. When we first arrived, we had a reservation, and it wasn't particularly packed, but they still asked us to wait. We waited in the bar for a while, but it got pretty warm, so we decided to step outside. When we stepped outside, the manager up front said good bye to us, and we had to tell him that we weren't leaving, and that we were waiting to be seated. He kind of looked surprised, and within a minute or so, asked us to follow him into the restaurant. Not a great start, but we didn't really mind - just a little strange.   The food was good, but again, nothing special. We both ordered the ribeye, and although they were in the pan, we found that the steaks got cold rather quickly. The sides that we ordered were also nothing out of the ordinary. I did however, enjoy my Caesar salad. I thought the presentation with whole leaves of lettuce unsliced and whole anchovies on top was kind of cool and tasty. And of course, the monkey bread was fantastic.  But once inside, the service was great, and the decor was nice. I found it to be more casual than other steakhouses, but it was a nice environment nonetheless.   Personally, I thought it paled a bit to our next stop at Delmonico...if you need a comparison.",

The waiter said would you like us to pick your meal for you.  Feeling a little adventurous we said sure.  We told him what steaks interested us and he said OK.  The appetizer was lobster bisque, cucumber salad, quail (that was to die for), and another salad I can't remember the name.  It was all Super Yummy!!!  Then we got a Filet and Skirt Steak.  Holy Cow!!!  Literally, this beef was sent from Heaven!  They were both moist and tender, and the Skirt Steak was very flavorful too.  It came with asparagus, potatoes, and a mixture of mushrooms.  Then for dessert it was sherbet and brown sugar ice cream on one dish, a plate of fruit, some chocolate and peanut butter parfait, and then the best thing ever was the monkey bread with banana ice cream.   :-D  Get It!  Monkey and Bananas  :-)  sooo Yummilicious!!!!!  We REALLY enjoyed dinner...  REALLY!!!",

The sides are of equal quality, flavor and large portions, something many fail at miserably. The staff  is pleasant and eager to deliver a positive dining experience. The wine list is interesting with some solid vintages, you can actually drink juice that is mature and ready. I have been to Craft more than once and try to hit it whenever I am in Vegas. Although not cheap, it is inline with any top tier steakhouse, you can spend more elsewhere for lesser quality and drink 2014 wine verses 2007. Nice job Tom Colicchio and team!",

And the 5-star service is because after every course, as soon as my date and I *thought* \"okay, we're done with this.\" they were already bringing out the next course with perfect timing; and our glasses were never below half and by no means was the staff intrusive or annoying -- they were perfect as well!  Total cost for the dinner I think was close to $400, but that included two drinks.  I still say, well worth it..",

    "text": "Craftsteak came highly recommended to me by several personal friends and co-workers.    Let me start with my only real criticisms.  The main dishes are all served in these small cast iron deep-sided dishes that rest on top of a normal plate.  Although this is probably done to ensure the food remains warm throughout the meal, it made it very difficult and kind of annoying to have to deal with eating your steak and sides out of a huge bowl (basically).  It was hard to cut the meat and even harder to try to grab some of the sides I placed in the plate (maybe you are supposed to use the plate underneath as your eating dish?? who knows, no one else was).  Second, my girlfriend and I both ordered steaks, and they were served to us pre-sliced.  wtf? I'm pretty sure that's a cardinal sin in the world of steak.  It causes the meat to loose all its juices into the plate before you're even served.  Third, we had to ask the server for the salt and pepper.  A little pretentious but no big deal.  Fourth, this is a fantastic restaurant, but not a True steakhouse (see below).  Lastly, not all the steaks are prime, and at $40+ per steak, I find that hard to swallow (yes!!! pun intended).    The food was overall exceptional.    Appetizers.  We started with the fresh buffalo mozzarella, which was served with a drizzle of oil and I'm pretty a house balsamic vinagraitte, that had a little more texture than you're regular balsamic.  The mozarella was accompanied by a sort of tomato relish and crumbled cashews (I think), and was absolutely delicious. Lots of flavor and texture, would definitely order again.    Bread.  I know, who does a review for the bread???  Well, in my worthless opinion, any staple of a good steakhouse is their bread/rolls.  Craftsteak did not disappoint.  We were served a small cast-iron pan containing 6 homemade parkerhouse rolls, seasoned with a little butter and sea salt.  It's almost worth skipping the appetizers and chowing down on some bread while waiting for the steaks.    Entrees.  Had to order steaks.  I ordered the hangar steak, medium-rare, and it was perfectly cooked.  I can't recall the last time I saw a hangar steak available on any steakhouse menu, and it was fantastic.  The cut of meet itself has plenty of texture without being overly difficult to chew, lots of flavor, very close in flavor to a ribeye, yet it looks like it was physically ripped from the cow  and placed in your plate, not a pretty cut, very masculine and satisfying to my caveman ego.  My girlfriend ordered the flat-iron steak, and it was also exceptional.  I think they marinated the flat-iron, but whatever they did it was phenomenal.  It almost tasted like some light soy sauce-based marinade.  Who knows, I could be wrong, but they definitely churched it up.    Sides.  We ordered the yukon gold puree, and it was awesome, would go great with any steak on the menu.  We also ordered the sauteed baby spinach, and it was, well, spinach, nothing special here.    Wine.  Phenomenal wine selection.  And by that I mean large (2300 choices, according to the menu), but seeing as how I wasn't going to spend $100 on a bottle, it was dissapointing to see that they only had about a dozen or so wine-by-the-glass selections (approx. 12 red and 12 white).    Dessert.  We shared the cinammon monkey bread, it was served with banana ice cream and crumbled walnuts, and it was freaking delicious.    Service.  We had some great service, absolutely no complaints in this department.    Seating.  The seating was a little odd.  We sat toward the front of the restaurant, on a couch with two small tables pulled up to it.  My girlfriend and I were on one end, and another party of two was on the other end.  It was a very loud location, with a lot of activity (we were basically sitting within a midget's throw of the bar).  They open these doors that essentially pour out into the busy and loud MGM corridor of shops and restaurants.  I would suggest asking for a table toward the back of the restaurant if you want a more intimate dining experience.    Price.  $200 for two ($230 if you include the cocktails).  I am all for paying top dollar for a great meal, but I felt that a few things were lacking quality wise and didn't justify the hefty price tag.  Primarily, I was really disappointed that the steaks weren't all prime-aged meats.  I don't think you can call yourself a steakhouse unless you have prime beef.    In Sum.  This was a very good meal.  The appetizer, steaks, puree, and dessert really blew out socks off, and made for a memorable meal.  However, a few things need to be discussed.  First, the lack of prime meats was sorely missed, and I don't think anything less than prime is worth $40+ per person.  Second, the steaks were delicious, but imagine how good they COULD be had they not been cut into pieces before getting to our plates??  Lastly, this is a terrific restaurant, but not a True steakhouse.",

I was lucky enough to be invited here by some charming locals who had the insider info (locals get 2 for 1 entrees), and was told that the ONLY thing to order was the A5 fillet. Well, they were right, that $200, lovely piece of meat was the best thing I've ever tasted in my entire life. So moist, tender, and yum..... my mouth is salivating at just the thought. I could go on about the steak forever... however, I must stop myself and describe the rest of the fare. The salad my lovely Genevieve M ordered was lackluster as well as bitter. Our charcuterie plate was delicious! The sampling of mustards was divine, and the little pretzel rolls were adorable. The selection of salami, prosciutto, and mortadella were perfection. I did enjoy the side of carrots, but the potatoes were lackluster as well as the french fries. The service here is impeccable, and the decor is very nice. I found the iron skillets the steask come in, a little  teeter tottish....but cute in concept. I would say that everything here is very basic, lemon, salt and pepper.... now, the A5 is amazing, and I will definitely be back for the 2 for 1 deal.... if I can find a local to go with ;) ...or perhaps I get a Nevada ID? N9NE is still my fav though.....as a whole you want not just the steak to be good, but the sides as well.",

    "text": "In a word, disappointed.  We wandered in because our first choice restaurant was closed on that (Sunday) evening.  We weren't terribly hungry but we'd read the top Vegas steak house lists and figured we could order a pretty satisfying steak salad.    The good ... A friendly bartender and a short wait.  The bad...most everything else.  The martinis were expensive and strong, but not so tasty (all gin, no vermouth). There weren't any steak salads on the menu but we figured we could fashion our own by ordering a couple of salads and a steak.  Alas, no. The Caesar salads were  lousy.  They were pre-made with large romaine lettuce leaves and anchovies laid out on top.  Unfortunately, no fresh dressing or freshly grated cheese to flavor them.  Most disappointingly was the steak, which was just plain flavorless. And the service was adequate at best.  Certainly not on par with any restaurants we go to in this price range.   In short, you are paying for Tom Colicchio' s name.  As a side note, the following night we ate at Strip Steak inside Planet Hollywood and found the steaks and sides to be simply delicious.",

Where other steakhouses seem to be concerned with letting you know how good of chefs they are, the ingredients prepared simply speaks to the real quality of the chefs in the back.  Yes, it is expensive, and probably a touch overpriced, but in Las Vegas, at a strip casino, a bit overpriced is probably a win.  I would recommend anyone who can afford this restaurant to go and experience a meal.",

First of all the Porterhouse rolls were a little bit of heaven, with some flaked salt on top and just-right butter (not too soft or hard). I ordered the Lobster Bisque (yummm - enormous chunks of lobster meat in a bowl, then they poured the bisque over it from a copper pot- fantastic), and the warm Frisee Salad with Egg and Bacon to go with. Our server said, \"This is good if you like blue cheese.\" Which I DO. It was rich and fantastic. I love a soft egg as dressing. I split the entree shortribs with my friend it it was melt-in-your mouth amazing. Our sides were potato puree (MMMMMMMM), baby spinach and brussells sprouts. Just incredible. It was one of the best meals I'd EVER had. Impeccable service, wonderful decor. The only thing that didn't fit was the loud music, which somehow didn't add to the ambiance. I still give it 5 stars.

    "text": "Being a big fan of Collichio, Top Chef & all things red meat, naturally I wanted to try Craftsteak and when my wife and I had a less than stellar experience at our $900 p/night Terrace Suite @ MGM (see review) and were comped $100 at Craftsteak, I figured we could come up with the extra $150 to cover the tab for two, so away we went.   I'll start by saying that I feel that eating a truly well prepared, quality cut of beef is one of the more enjoyable things in life and Craftseak did not disappoint and truly lived up to the hype. We ordered the winter tasting menu for 2 - beet and endive salads, roasted quail in balsamic reduction, kobe flat iron, braised short ribs, jumbo sea scallops, garlic potato puree, and deserts. I went into this expecting small portions. 1st because its a 'tasting' menu and 2nd because its an above-market place where everything is ala carte. I was wrong. This was seriously enough food for like six people and a truly grand, medieval spread fit for kings! I haven't been to the NYC or LA locations, so maybe they serve up bigger portions at the Vegas spot to satisfy the ever expanding waistlines of the rotund, mouth breathing Mid-Westerners in denim shorts and pastel stretch pants that seem to dominate Vegas. Giant women with high rise stonewashed jeans from Old Navy, white sneakers and short haircuts.. The horror.. People like that though would be much more at home with the $9.99 prime rib @ The Flamingo though so who knows. Bottom line: Craftsteak is top drawer; starting with the excellent service from several waiters who do not miss even the smallest detail. The food is spot on - perfectly seasoned, simple yet artfully prepared and presented. Small details like brushing the tops of the dinner rolls with clarified butter & sea salt.. The quail was amazing and some of the most tender and well seasoned fowl I've ever had. The salads and sides were ok but what truly shines here is the beef. The Kobe flat iron was hands down one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. Since my wife is veg-ish and had only the scallops and sides, I had a lot of beef to consume, so by the time desert arrived I felt like I was going to explode. Desert was also incredible. The cinnamon roll they brought was a phenomenal marriage of molten hot cinnamon, sugar and gooey dough. I could go on and on.  Its expensive and for two, with wine, one should be ready to drop a few bills, but somehow, its totally worth it. Sometimes you gotta shell if you want something good.",

First of all the warm frisee salad I got was heavy, heavy on the blue cheese.  I love blue cheese but it was a little too much even for me and boring.  The other people's salads looked like just a lot of quantity and not a lot of quality.  Pretty boring.    I ordered the filet mignon and it was DRY.  The sauce on it was a little strange too with a star anise type flavor to it.  Another person ordered the T-bone, same thing.  Very dry.  We were so looking for a tasty juicy steak.    Lastly the service was meh.  There seemed to be a slight attitude and I didn't feel very welcome.    Overall, among all the steak houses I've been to, this place was a huge disappointment.  I would not go back there for the steak.  With all the competition in Vegas, this place was all hype and no quality.",

The interior was sexy, elegant and modern, with a very relaxing vibe (makes you forget that the restaurant is located within a casino).    Service and food was outstanding.  Highlights: buttery rolls served in small cast iron pans, the best lobster bisque I've ever tasted, perfectly cooked/presented steaks - everything was above & beyond & delicious.

It had already slid of the bone by the time it reached me. I really wanted to try the wagyu, but I didn't want to have to sell a kidney.  I also ordered the Fries, which might sound average, but these are soaked in sherry vinegar before frying, and topped with smoked paprika. They're delicious.  DRINKS A very good selection of various alcoholic beverages, but my attention went to the Whiskey. They have several smokey whiskeys and scotches and was able to try one that wasn't even on the menu yet, the Audbeg. Smooth, smokey and I wanted more.  PRICE Not cheap. Probably the opposite of cheap, but it's Tom Colicchio, so you'd be ignorant to think otherwise.",

They have it all: Italian, Seafood, Chinese, French, you name it...but nothing sounded better than a good steakhouse...so Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak it was!   I am a huge Lobster Bisque fan, so I couldn't resist trying theirs, and I was really impressed with the overall flavor and the large pieces of Maine lobster meat. I would highly recommend it if you are a lobster fan at all. How much do I love lobster, you ask? Enough to order Surf & Turf with Lobster for my main course (we were at a steakhouse after all)! It was also delicious, and the 6 oz. sirloin was cooked precisely to my request...nice and juicy, but not bloody. The entrees are listed separate from the sides, a I decided to get an order of their Rosemary Fingerling Potatoes, which were the perfect accompaniment to the rest of my meal. I did manage to snitch some of my friend's butternut squash risotto though, and it was ridiculously amazing!  The atmosphere was very low key and quiet...a nice change from the typical hustle and bustle of the rest of the MGM. If you like your fermented grapes, they have a nice wine selection as well! Everyone in my party enjoyed their dinner and would certainly venture back when in the area, but service was a bit slow even though we were there way past the dinner rush, so I unfortunately couldn't give Craft 5 stars.",

    "text": "Came with a group of 6. Ordered the group Angus course, which was salads, then steaks and sides. Deserts at the end. Comes out to $129/ per person. I enjoyed most of the salads, except the kale - heavily salted.  The steak cuts were mostly enjoyable. The horse raddish sauce was powerful.  Of the sides, I enjoyed the pureed potato the most. The deserts were good, but overkill after all of that. Not a bad deal though.  My biggest gripe is with their sommelier and their wine list. She needs a clue:   I wanted a good dinner wine. I usually like leathery Grenache wines from Rhone Valley. I've had great ones for $40-$80 per bottle. Dinner wine/table wine. Instead, I'm inundated with a list of $1000 to $12000 wines. I like table wines. Great wines can be had for under $100. If a sommelier needs to keep pointing at pricey wines in order to recommend me a good wine for dinner, then they're not doing their job to me. They are a piss poor sommelier.   I just want a decent dinner wine at a fair price. Get a god damn clue, and save your most over-priced grape juices for the whales. Understand how to read your customers so a simple dinner doesn't have to be so awkward and idiotic.  I had to settle for a martini and a beer rather than a reasonable wine to go with my dinner. I was annoyed by that.  Summary:   Pro: Steaks were decent. Most of the appetisers were decent. Some of the sides were great. Decadent Deserts.  Con: 1.) They wouldn't take phone reservations. Forced us to come downstairs and forced us to wait around. 2.) There needs to be a reasonable wine list for reasonable people - some of those thousand dollar wines are to be savored for an experience someone might want. I want a decent dinner wine. Get a clue.  For half the price, I had a better experience at Wolfgang's CUT",

The risotto was the best that I have ever had!  I could have just eaten that.  We also enjoyed the Brussels sprouts as well.  We skipped desert, as we were both pretty full.  I had a coffee afterwards, which was very good.  One of my problems in Vegas is that when you get coffee at Starbucks, or through the casino, it usually is not very hot.

If you are unsure of what you'd like to order for wine, don't be afraid to ask the wine steward for suggestions.   They know every wine and can suggest a bottle that matches your meal and your wallet.  The salad course is always a winner.   A personal favorite is the blackened red pepper in olive oil dressing.   Another is the Arugila salad.      You simply cannot beat their Kobe Steak.   It's expensive, but you know where the money went.   You do not really even need a knife, it just melts in your mouth.   Simply wonderful.     Desserts are very tasty and refreshing.   Although, the portions are big enough that it's hard to even think about dessert.   It's not cheap.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been to the Craftsteak at MGM Foxwoods a number of times prior to it closing and I would give that location 5 stars. Our experience here wasn't as enjoyable.  We decided to give it a try Wednesday night. Having looked on opentable the day or so prior, it seemed like there were plenty of times available so I didn't bother making a reservation. When we arrived at 8:15, we were told the soonest we could be seated was 9:30.We decided to look elsewhere to eat. While doing so, out of curiosity I decided to take a peak at my opentable app and was able to book a reservation at 8:45, which caused us some confusion. Why couldn't they have booked this reservation at the hostess desk? We show back up at 8:45, were seated within a minute, and walked by several open tables at the bar which we specificied earlier would have been fine. Kind of left a bad taste in our mouths to start.   Every time we've gone to Craftsteak at Foxwoods, we'd share the wagyu ribeye and it was easily the best steak I've ever had, every time. Worth every penny of the $100+. We ordered what we assumed was the same waygu ribeye, but it was unmistakably different. It was the leanest ribeye I've ever had, from the Texas Roadhouse to Grill 32 Boston. If I was told it was a sirloin, I'd think yeah this pretty good...for a sirloin.  The Foxwood's steak was cut to be shared and the marbleization was so extensive the pieces would fall apart as you lifted it, and those smaller pieces would melt in your mouth. A knife was not needed.   I did some research, finding the Craftsteak at Foxwoods menu PDF, even though they closed: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxwoods.com%2FuploadedFiles%2FPages%2FDine%2Fcraftsteak_menu.pdf&s=7a256881424d8e76142e2e0a018d9d25e30213baefb5d3304c5319fdd30f00c8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foxwoods.com/uploadedFil...</a>. They were both 14 oz wagyu ribeyes, but the one at Foxwoods specifies the grade (8) and the farm (Sher Ranch, Australia), and was also $134 vs the $105. We were told by the manager they get their meat from the same farm as the other locations. I didn't have these details at the time, but it didn't matter, it was not comparable. The price different is my only objective evidence of these steaks being of different grades and/or from a different ranch.  What saved the rating was the service. We voiced our confusion and slight dissatisfaction, and they were more than willing to replace it but we declined. To our surprise, they comped the steak which was shocking considering the price.",

    "text": "Since we didn't hit Craftsteak on our last trip to Vegas, I made a point to eat here this time. No tasting menu this time now that my husband and I have lost 120lbs together and are just eating differently. So, we were a tad more conservative, but still splurged and left with our bellies full.   We split the lobster bisque to start, which was good, but cannot compare to Kokomo's (which is now closed to make room for Tom's Heritage Steak BOO). I didn't like the large pieces of tarragon on top, which feels like chewing on pieces of grass, but it was tolerable. The lobster was nice and tender.  For dinner we split the 10oz filet, the potato puree and the risotto.  This was still so much food! The risotto was made with butternut squash and prosciutto and was so rich and creamy and really wonderful. I know this is what properly made risotto tastes like and how easy it can be to get it wrong.  The puree and filet were absolute heaven.  For dessert we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake and I was pretty disappointed. It was a small circle of mushy pumpkin with a vanilla cream of some kind on top of it. I hate to say it, but Cheesecake Factory cheescake was better than this stuff. Major bummer, thus the deletion of a star. When you pay $15 for dessert at a place like this, you want to shove your face it in and eat 15 of them, not just pick at it and wish it were more like at a chain where you hate their food.",

As expected, the service here is on point so I'll talk about the food:  -Apps here are amazing.  Bread here is amazing.  I will warn you, though, don't get suckered into eating so much bread or apps becasue you won't have much room for the actual dinner.  -We tried family style steaks, getting a little but of each steak craved up for us.  NY was good..Filet was juicy...ribeye was flavorful...but it is all in the flank. Yes, I said flank!  Ask the server put the flank next to you.  When you're done eating as much as you can, that's when you can offer the rest to the entire group.  Just think about it:  While all the amateurs are going for the filet, you'll be in steak heaven with the flank.  And yes...you can thank me later!  I can't wait to go back on my next visit in Vegas!",

I was on a double date and my date and I arrived early so we ordered drinks at the bar. A dirty martini and a beer - $40. REALLY!? I'll admit that the bartender was AMAZING and offered me blue cheese stuffed olives and they were delicious.   Our friends showed up and they seated us at a table that was partially outside of the restaurant so we can see people walking by.  Not sure if I liked this or not, but I guess it didn't matter that much.  My date and I shared the NY Strip and ordered corn for our sides.  The steak seemed cooked a little more medium than the medium rare we ordered, but it was good.  Our sides were corn and scalloped potatoes. I was SEVERLY disappointed they didn't have mac n cheese. Fine dining steakhouse mac n cheese is the best!!    I had a really great time with my friends and my date, but the restaurant experience itself did not seem extraordinary for the exorbitant prices.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place as our fancy spot during our Vegas trip.  The service was impeccable!  Pretty fast, attentive and friendly.  However the food wasn't, sorry servers :/  The server said the ribeye was quite popular so we went with it, medium rare. Out of the seafood she recommended the halibut or scallops (should've went with the scallops).  The ribeye was ookay.  It was pretty chewy and and parts of it were really difficult to cut with the knife. It seemed a tad over medium rare, but I could not understand why it felt kind of stringy.  They cut it for us so maybe they didn't let it rest enough? I have no idea.  For the price, we expected perfection and I could've easily made something more tasty and tender :/ Also no sides come with it.  Halibut was overcooked.  I was so excited to see what perfect halibut tasted like. The buttery sauce was tasty, but couldn't really overlook the dry stringiness.  I was full after the steak and really should've just left it alone, it wasn't really enjoyable to eat.  I mean, it even -looked- overcooked when we got it.    We also got the arugula salad, which wasn't mindblowing. It was fresh, it was okaay. I had to have some grass to munch on.  In hindsight I should've  a) sent back both dishes or at least the halibut (but we were running late so didn't want to wait for a new order, and the dinnermate had finished half the halibut already & we were pretty full already) and  b) ordered the 24 hr braised short ribs (because it would seriously take skill to get that wrong), but my dinner mate doesn't like ribs. (WHAT THE FK I cannot even comprehend and must rethink the relationship.  Infuriating. Anyway.)  Probably the best part of the meal was the bread (well, smelling it for me, as I have a gluten allergy). Warm, fresh, buttery, beauuutifully crispy on top with sea salt and so soft inside. Jesus, I have never missed bread more.  Ah well, probably an off day/meal.",

My husband and I ordered drinks and once our table was ready the hostess notified us and was ready to show us to our table. However, she made no offer to have our drinks brought to our table. Not that I was expecting HER to do it but she could've had someone else do it. It's awkward when you're at the bar, have your purse in tow, jacket on and have to carry a martini glass wearing heels to your table. That's my only gripe :)  Food and service thereafter was great. The best thing about this place is that they are completely fine with you splitting an entree. We shared the lobster bisque which they offered to split for us which was great! We then shared the rib eye which was cooked perfectly medium rare and ordered the risotto as a side. The food was really tasty and just the right amount without being overly stuffed. Our waiter and staff were all very good. The waiter even put a rush in for our food since we had a show to catch. Very nice of him.",

    "text": "Very disappointed by the food and service at Craftsteak - definitely not recommended for a dining room experience.  Food: We had a party of 8, and 7 ordered steaks. All specified medium rare and 3 out of 7 weren't close. I opted for the special dry-aged bone-in filet (think this was $90) and it was way overcooked - nearly well done. What a way to ruin a $90 steak! Meanwhile, two others got the standard filet on the menu and both were far undercooked. I just don't understand how a place that is charging $90 can get steaks so wrong.  Service: Simply bad. Our food took forever, and we had to ask multiple times to get requests fulfilled. Worst was that I asked my waiter for the wine list three times and he never brought it. You'd think that surely by the 3rd request (if not the 2nd) an apology and making it his priority would be the correct action, but no, not even an apology was offered - and I had to ask someone else to finally get it, at the 4th time of asking. I also don't think I once got my water or iced tea refilled without having to ask for it. Again, given the price point, I just don't think this is at all acceptable.  The only saving grace (and why I add +1 star) is the wine list and cocktail list. There is an extensive wine by the glass selection including some premium selections (in part due to usage of the Coravin system) and fantastic spirits flights, including lots of great scotch (I opted for the Isle of Jura flight, which included 1oz pours of the 10, 16, 30, and 1976 varieties). So doing some of these at the bar might be OK. But I'd never consider eating here again - not with the inconsistent/bad execution and inattentive service.",

Absolutely incredible customer service with attentive & knowledgable staff from start to finish with exquisite cuisine! What more can you ask for?  TO START: We had a cocktail each and the bread & butter they start you off with is amazing. Our waiter had to warn us to not fill up on it as we had a lot of food coming. Oh, but it was so hard not to! As for appetizers, we started with a WARM FRISEE SALAD (farm egg & smoked bacon), the MAINE LOBSTER BISQUE soup, & the SHRIMP COCKTAIL.   SECOND COURSE: We went for the DOMESTIC WAGYU, which comes with a 14 OZ SKIRT STEAK & a 14 OZ RIBEYE. We also added the LOBSTER to our entree, and got the POTATO PUREE (yukon gold potatoes with chives, highly recommended!), ASPARAGUS (lemon zested), SWEET CORN, & the ASSORTED WILD MUSHROOMS. Yes, we went all out.   DESSERT: We were caught off guard when they brought us out MONKEY BREAD, FARMERS MARKET FRUIT, SORBET SELECTION, & CHEESECAKE. We were so stuffed, we only ate the sorbet and ended up having to pack everything up to go! The monkey bread was his favorite, the mango sorbet was mine.   Everything about this place screamed quality. From the service to the drinks to the food -- it was all just hands down outstanding. I always recommend this place to anyone who asks about a good place for a classy dinner or a restaurant to get a good steak... two thumbs up & five stars all around! TOM COLICCHIO, WELL DONE! :)",

I don't think it's possible to have a better experience than this restaurant offers.  We felt like royalty from the moment we walked up to the hostess stand.  It's everything I imagined a fancy dinner would be.   If you can afford it I'd recommend the tasting menu...there are many to choose from and they bring you a ridiculous amount of food.  I love their huge portion sizes.  It's not just the size but the sheer variety that the tasting menu affords that is so satisfying.    I got the domestic wagyu surf and turf and hubs got the A5 Japanese Wagyu.  For starters they brought us Caesar salad, prosciutto, mozzarella, and parker house rolls.  They were gonna bring out lobster bisque but I told them that was yucky and they brought out a shrimp cocktail instead.  Everything was amazing except for the mozzarella which was doused in roasted red peppers and peanuts (WTF?).  It really needed some bread or something but I'm not Italian so maybe I just didn't....understand.    Then came the steaks, lobster tail, pureed potatoes, asparagus, and assorted mushrooms.  The mushrooms are truly a sight to behold and contained hen of the woods, baby portabellas, and white beech mushrooms.  The asparagus stems were shaved for maximum tenderness and the steaks....OMG THE STEAKS....they'll CHANGE YO LIFE. The mouth feel and texture is unlike any steak I've ever had.  So tender...like chewing bubble gum.   The desserts were earth-shattering.  The monkey bread brought me to tears.  The carrot cake was the best I've ever had.  The sorbets were delectable and the fruit was....well....fruit.... but executed well and thoughtfully chosen.   Just do it.  TREAT YO SELF.  You won't regret it.",

Came with 2 shrimp cocktails and 4 other apps. we got to choose.  We also got to choose 6 sides to share and it included dessert.   $160 per person for all that. Amazing deal. Best dinner I have ever had.  Don't go anywhere else if you want an amazing meal.   Service and setting were outstanding as well.  Will be back next time in Vegas.",

    "text": "More buns please...  So I never stuff myself with the bread baskets but this place changes that! The buns with soft butter are phenomenal! They come to your table hot & ready to be devoured and you just can't say no to them.  This place is a lot of fun and noisy so keep that in mind when you're planning your evening. Sometimes it feels like you're dining with your neighbors.   The food is consistently great! Steaks are big & juicy and always flavorful. Sides you shouldn't skip would definitely be the Yukon gold puree & Maui onions. I love eating tender onions with my meat! The Caesar here is ok but not great and the carrots & spinach are ok as well. Shrimp cocktails are always fresh and if you weren't stuffed enough already, leave some room for dessert! The monkey bread with ice cream is sinful in every way but worth each bite. Great to share if you have a group of people! The chef also sends out complimentary nutty bar bites at the end of your meal which are perfect little bites for those who love sweets!  We enjoy coming here and each visit is a great one!",

I must say they have THE BEST Casear salad with pickled anchovies. I ask to have them cut the lettuce, otherwise it will be served whole which I don't mind either.

We were staying at the MGM and this restaurant was an easy pick since we didn't have to leave the hotel!  Craftsteak is a very spacious & hip/Sheik restaurant. Dim lights & warm earthy colors throughout. Our table was at one of the side rooms. We had a great gathering of friends and were very hungry after a full day of adventures !  Took a look at the wine menu, all bottles are in the $100+ range, except for two reds @ $65.. I think I've seen them at $15, but then this is Vegas so there you go. My old fashioned was like candy, Bullet bourbon $12.   The steak menu was impressive, I wanted a fatty steak to absorb the mayhem of cocktails I had and will have . Ordered 22 oz T-Bone @ $58, was able to eat half and shared the rest with the table. For sides ordered Cauliflower, was tasty and can't remember what the rest of the group ordered.   Great service, we had 3-4 people serving, replenishing drinks, taking photos for us.   Steaks were great, super busy & noisy, overpriced, but got the job done..",

The Lemon-drop martini was icy cold and crisp followed by some East and West coast oyster. Watch out for the fresh horseradish...it's got a punch!  Onto the Warm Frisee salad which is a must have. It has egg, bacon and the most delicious dressing. The main course was Waygu steak with an assortment of 4 different mushrooms.  My fave was the Hen of the Woods.  Lastly the finale arrived...dessert. The Cinnamon Monkey Bread with Banana ice cream is just unreal! I would come here just for this!  I give this place a 5 star because the food was fantastic and the service level of Michael at the bar was the best. This will be my go-to place anytime I come to Las Vegas for steaks.",

    "text": "Gorgeous, elegant ambiance and delicious, well-executed food. Came here for an early 5PM dinner before catching the KA show also located in the MGM.   Menu-wise it's fairly standard steakhouse fare with the appetizers and salads, different cuts of meat, smaller seafood selection and sides. They give you free bread--baked Hawaiian rolls with salt sprinkled on top. Very buttery and delicious. We ordered the Warm Frisee Salad and Organic Green Lettuces to start. The first is more of a rich, creamy concoction disguised as a salad. It is anything but light and healthy due to the generous amounts of blue cheese and bacon. It's very rich and savory and I enjoyed the first few bites but it did get overwhelming. The latter, contrastingly, is very light and refreshing with a lemon vinaigrette.   The steaks are separated into grilled and roasted. The roasted ones are first pan seared then finished in the oven FYI. All four of us chose steaks and I had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon medium. It was so well cooked that I enjoyed it very much even though it was a bit more raw than the pink I usually request. While some steak houses focus on seasoning and a more buttery meat, this place is more purist. The steaks are very simple and minimally seasoned but mouth-watering and delicious. Everything is served a la carte and also had the Brussels sprouts as a side. Brussel sprouts were very flavorful and rich.  For dessert we had the Carrot Cake and Fruit Platter. Carrot Cake was the perfect amount of sweetness with a yummy cream cheese frosting and the maple ice cream was a great contrast both flavor and texture-wise. Presentation of the fruit platter was gorgeous with all the fruits delicately sliced and arranged to create a colorful aesthetic.",

I recommend being adventurous and letting the chef choose your meals. Everything was literally perfect. From for shrimp cocktail, salads, sweet corn to the steaks and seafood we were beyond words. My fiance and I eat at the best restaurants in the country. We never thought we would top a place in Napa we ate at a few months back. Especially in Vegas. This place exceeded anything I could have imagined.   I want to make sure I mention one of the best wait staff I have ever encountered. Brianna (hope I spelled that correctly) was knowledgeable and correctly attentive. Great smile and wonderful personality. Best service person I've ever had and that's saying a ton. Best moment of the evening is when Bri brought desert plates when I was completely done. She says, \"you just relax or go put on some stretchy pants because it's coming!\"  Absolutely hilarious and it made me beyond excited for the final course.   Desert was absolutely amazing. Dear gosh.   Kendall Dumford is the director of restaurants At MGM and is clearly an outstanding executive for this huge property. I can't recommend her or this place enough.",

    "text": "They have a 3 course menu option for parties of 2 or more. We shared 4 of these amongst a party of 9. You can pick the steak you want from that category, and they pick the starters, sides, and desserts, though they did accommodate some specific requests we had for sides.   Double R Beef $135/person. We ordered 2 of these meal sets, 1 with 18 oz ribeye and 1 with 16 oz NY strip.   Domestic Wagyu $170/person. We ordered 2 of these meal sets as well, 1 with 14 oz eye of rib and 1 with 14 oz NY strip.   We also ordered 2 plates of diver sea scallops $44.   First, they brought out bread and butter. The top has a nice crust that is slightly crunchy. A good contrast to the soft roll. We wanted it hot and fresh though, and it took 3 orders before it came out hot enough.   The first course was 4 salads to share: - Caesar Salad: I didn't try any because it had anchovies on it.  - Warm Frisee: I don't remember it being warm, but it was my favorite of the salads as it was very flavorful because of the blue cheese.  - Market Spinach: This was my second favorite salad. I think it had a raspberry vinaigrette, which went well with the peaches and walnuts.  - Wild Arugula: This one was OK. I think the server said it was ranch dressing, but I'm not sure. I don't like ranch, but I tried a little. It didn't taste super ranch-y, but I was so paranoid of ranch I didn't want more. I make no sense sometimes.   When the steaks came out, I forgot which was which and just tried a piece of each. I couldn't really taste the difference between them. They do precut it into strips which helps with sharing. Lately, I just haven't been super impressed with steaks I have out at steakhouses. I like the steak my boyfriend makes at home because he butter bastes it. Basically, I'm no expert on meat quality. Give me butter or good sauce with steak that's not too tough and I'm happy. Tangent aside, I thought the steak here was OK, but didn't find it that mouthwatering.   We received 4 sides to share. I'm not sure if the portion we received is the same size you'd get if you order a la carte.  - Brentwood Sweet Corn: This one was my favorite side, maybe my favorite item of the whole night. I wish I could have a whole bowl to myself.  - Potato Puree: Very smooth, but a little bland in my opinion.  - Heirloom Cauliflower: This was pretty good. A solid way to consume some veggies.  - White Corn Grits: I would've liked a creamier texture. The grits were a little too big and lumpy for my preference.   Finally, 5 desserts to finish off.  - Cinnamon Monkey Bread: I feel like this seems more like a breakfast item to me, versus dessert. I did enjoy the pecan toffee sauce it was generously covered with. I didn't realize it was served with banana ice cream. It tasted pretty plain to me.  - Sorbet: I think it was coconut, mango, raspberry, and strawberry. The raspberry was super tart. I think the mango was my favorite of these.  - Vanilla Creme Brulee: Creme brulee in upscale restaurants like this are usually a safe choice. Very creamy, but doesn't stand out.  - Vanilla Bean Cheesecake: I just had a small bite, and the cheesecake had kind of fallen apart by the time it came to me, so impression was kind of skewed from that alone. I can't say the taste was memorable.  - Chocolate Cake: I don't care for chocolate cakes in general, as it's just too much chocolate for me. I didn't know the ice cream was strawberry, as it was very plain in flavor again, like the banana ice cream.   *****  My Star Ratings:  1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.  2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return.  3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.  4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already.  5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here.",

    "text": "What a disappointment!  Craftsteak used to be our favorite steak house to go to in Vegas. We used to bring our out of town guests here and celebrate our anniversary or special occasions. Stopped by last. Ohhh before heading to a concert.   Sat at the bar. Staff were all very nice and friendly. Place was super busy which is always the case here. But now staff just look over whelmed and short handed.    Ordered  Wagu  steak tartar, foie gras, salad and Chilean sea bass.   Steak tartare- completely flavorless. Wagu has a nice buttery smoothness to it and this didn't have any taste whatsoever. Even after adding pepper and salt. Worse part was it came with toasted French baguettes instead of something nicer like Melba toast.  1 Star  Foie Gras-  tasted frozen. Didn't have the richness you'd expect in fresh foie gras. Bland  Salad- drowned in dressing. It was 1/2 soup 1/2 salad.  Chilean Seabass-  I LOVE Sea bass, Chilean Seabass!  And this wasn't Chilean. Or if it was it was badly cooked. Or precooked, set out to sit for a while and then reheated when ordered!  Why reheat a piece of fish that takes 5 minutes to cook??      For the prices you're paying here you'd expect top notch quality and cooking.  Not anymore. Seems like this place has gone the route of many other Las Vegas restaurants and decided to choose profit over quality.  Welcome to corporate America!  I'm sure they will close down soon to remodel. And come back worse than how they were.   How about keep it simple. Great quality food. Cooked correctly.   I'd be embarrassed to put my name as chef here.",

My friends chicken was subpar. Maybe it was his fault for order chicken at a steak house but honestly the check was kind of dry and had little to no flavor.",

    "text": "I was going to the Hugh Jackman show at the Grand Garden.  I made a reservation for 5:30 when I was in the area a month ago.  Open Table does not work for Craftsteak.  Later, I realized the show was scheduled for 7:00.  I also got an email saying that Jackman would take the stage promptly at 7 PM so be on time.  I am OCD when it comes to timeliness.  I was going to call and ask to move the reservation to 5 or 5:15 but instead, I showed up at the podium shortly after they opened at 5.  Telling the hostess that I had a 5:30 reservation, she said there would be a short wait.  She seated thew people with reservations for 5 PM first and then they showed me to my seat.  The section where I sat in the bar area have couch seating on one side and a chair on the opposite side.  I took the couch seat violating my \"Wild Bill\" rule but I had a perfect view of the Dodgers' game.  My servers were a man and woman--Team #14.  My iced tea was brought promptly and a runner brought rolls in a skillet and a pad of soft butter.  I ordered lobster bisque to start, a 16 ounce bone-in NY Strip for the main course with a side of hen in the woods mushrooms.  This is one place where they do half orders on sides--a big plus for me.  I asked for the steak to be cooked blue.  The lobster bisque was good--pretty standard fare that could have used more lobster pieces given the price.  Prior to the steak being brought, a runner stopped by and placed a warm dish on the table.  I wondered why but it soon became evident.  The steak was served in an oval platter and the meat had been cut from the bone-in cooking which saves the diner trying to get as much of the meat away from the bone without picking ti up and gnawing like I might do at home.  The steak had a nice char on both sides.  The thickness allowed for the interior to be very rare as I like. The hen in the woods side was good but I didn't find it as flavorful fungus as other types. There was enough pan juice that I took one of the rolls and soaked up some of the juices for extra enjoyment.  The server asked me about dessert.  He brought the menu and after a while came back and asked what I had decided.  Sensing I was in doubt, he suggested the cinnamon monkey bread which he said was \"life changing.\"  Judge Judy would call that \"puffing.\"  I decided to change my life and order the monkey bread--something I generally would not have gotten.  And then I waited, and waited, and waited--looking at my watch and the baseball game.  My timelines OCD was starting to kick in.  My server came by about 15 minutes later and seeing I didn't have dessert told me he'd check on it.  I told him we could just cancel dessert.  He went to check and came back and said pastry was AWOL (my word, not his), and he assured me it would be right out.  In a minute or so, a runner stopped by with the monkey bread.  The menu describes it as: cinnamon brioche, pecan toffee sauce, banana ice cream.  It's an individual portion and it's quite good.  The server brought my check shortly after and explained he didn't want to be a hold up after I was finished.  I was glad I waited.  This was a completely different dessert from what I would normally have ordered.  Thanks to my server for his help in getting my dessert and getting me out with time to spare for the show.  I was not charged for the dessert.  I noticed when I got home and looked at the sales slip.  From Now On, I'll make my reservation earlier.  This Is Me!  And, yes, I am listening to The Greatest Showman as I write this review.",

    "text": "Wow! This is probably one of the best restaurants MGM has to offer. I was here twice in one week.   The second time we went, we got the tasting menu. It's definitely the way to go if you have a large group! Here's what we got:  Starters:  - ITALIAN BUFFALO MOZZARELLA (9/10): this was SO yummy!! I loved the simplicity of it. It's mozzarella, topped with diced red peppers, olive oil and hazelnuts.   - HEIRLOOM TOMATOES (8/10): pretty basic but still yummy! Just sliced heirloom tomatoes drizzled with salt and olive oil.   - SPINACH SALAD (7/10): also another basic salad. Still really good!   - SHRIMP COCKTAIL (9/10): SO yummy and fresh tasting!!   Main Dishes:  - RIBEYE, HANGER, FLAT IRON, & TBONE (10/10): omfg all of these were YUMMY!! I really loved the ribeye (always my fave), but the flavors overall were incredible. It was all also cooked perfectly.   - SEA BASS (8/10): this was good! A little on the fishier side than I'm used to. But still good.   - SALMON (8/10): I wish the salmon skin was crispier, but overall still good.   Sides:  - ASPARAGUS, SPINACH, & ASSORTED MUSHROOMS (8/10): all solid side dishes. Nothing really wowed me, but still great!   - HEIRLOOM CAULIFLOWER (10/10): now this was the side dish I loved the most! There's something about charred cauliflower that just tastes incredible. Definitely get this!   Dessert  - CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE (9/10): this was sinfully good!!! I wanted to eat the whole thing. Lol.   We also got the Monkey Bread, which everyone loved (I didn't try it).   The service here is really good as well. The servers called us by name and everything. I'd definitely be back!!",

    "text": "My most recent trip to Vegas turned into a food and restaurant exploration.   Craftsteak was on my list.   Ive had great luck with Vegas steakhouses and I wanted to see what Tom Colicchio offered up.  The atmosphere and dress was semi formal, collared shirt expected.  We were promptly seated and shown menus.  The drink menu was quite extensive, with a very complimentative food menu to boot. I went with the dry aged tbone and a side of fries.  Just after waiting, we were approached by a female photographer who was absolutely insistent on taking out pictures... even after multiple denials by us. Pictures were taken and she left. This ruined our experience a bit, mainly with how pushy she was to take our photos.  The wait for food wasn't too long, around 30 minutes and the steak came out in a steaming skillet, pre-cut off the bone.  The smell, tantalizing! Cutting into the steak was like cutting into butter. Savoring every bite, I slowly chipped away at the steaks.  The fries... came out a over seasoned and were tough to eat.  As I grinded to a halt, I had to reminisce about other steaks Ive had and how this compared to other Vegas steakhouses.  The presentation was A+ but I was left craving some greenery or an addition to the steak that I had seen at other steak houses. Don't get me wrong, a slab of meat in front of me I will always be happy about, but an addition to the plate would be beneficial.  I compare CraftSteak to a restaurant like StripSteak and I almost always lean towards StripSteak.  CraftSteak is the more formal older brother... better service, does the meat properly, no frills.  StripSteak is more of a casual atmosphere with a bit more adventure on the plate.  Both fantastic steaks.  But... here comes Ms. photographer again.  Even after we told her we didn't want the photos, she put them in professional booklets, and pushed and pushed and pushed for us to buy one and the discount rate of (around) $70... no thank you.  Remove the photographer and I give CraftSteak a 4.5, without a 3.5 is where it settles.",

Then I ordered a fillet mignon and oh boy, what a juicy piece of meat that was    I was very pleased with their service. And at the end very full. We couldn't even think of dessert at that point. But maybe next time. I shall return to this place again.   We did try their ribeye and surf & turf as well. All were super scrumptious. Will definitely need to come back here again to try other dishes, or the same dishes. Either way I'm sure I'll be one happy man at the end of it.",

I am a firm believer in the the fact that a good cut of meat with salt and pepper should suffice and that you need nothing else. Sides were ok. I always love the beet appetizer, and the cauliflower side with garlic was amazing, but everything else was just okay. For the price, I would rather go to Prime at the Bellagio.",

It was very chewy and tasted kind of old. The sides we're very plain, the potatoes we got were just school lunch style potatoes wedges. I expected more from a James Beard winner, these dishes definitely wouldn't make the cut on Top Chef because they were so standard. We've seeked out steakhouses in Chicago, Miami, San Diego, LA and yes even Cleveland and Pittsburgh steakhouses are better then this.   We recently went to Stripsteak by Michael Mina in Miami another James Beard winning chef. All we could do is compare how the whole experience to food and staff was so much better than  Craftsteak. Honestly Craftsteak was such a let down.   I used to hold Tom in great esteem but now I think he takes advantage of his name to trick vacationers to overpay for his very basic restaurant. I would recommend you find another steakhouse in Vegas.",

Great place for group meals, dates, business meetings, special occasions, etc...  Food: 1) Ribeye - 18oz ($63) was fantastic. Delicious, juicy, tender, and fatty. Way too much meat. I should've split the steak with someone. 2) Fries- thicker fries, but not as thick as steak fries. Seasoning was fantastic and addicting. 3) Mushroom medley - fantastic 4) Cauliflower - very crispy and amazing.  Service: Excellent as you would expect a nice steakhouse such as this to be since you're paying so much $$$$. Our server gave us a nice delicious gummy dessert for the bachelor.",

Bernardo the Manager went above and beyond to make sure we fully enjoyed our meal and I can't thank him enough for that.   Tom Colocchio knows how to deliver an unbelievable dining experience in his restaurants and it show in every interaction we had with his staff.

The sides were on point and complimented our steaks nicely. Service is exceptional and overall dining experience was wonderful.   I would highly recommend this steakhouse if you haven't already sampled the most delicious steak in your life!  Make sure to make a reservation, this is a Vegas eatery!  Cheers!",

My friends were already in the restaurant, after I sat down within two minutes the waiter came for my drink order. When he came back he rattled off impressively the menu which is new everyday. I had the filet as did the girls, and we all shared fries, mash potatoes and carmelized sweet corn. We shared salads and the one i had had poached egg and bacon which i liked. On to the main course.....All I can say was that my steak was cooked medium well. That can be a pain to cook and I get it. This was the best prepared and tasting steak that I have had in my life! Cooked to perfection. The sweet corn was a different dish for me that I enjoyed as well. Throughout the evening we had a tag team of a Male and female server. They were on top of everything. Even though I didn't have room for dessert, we had a cinnamon roll with ice cream. Nothing extravagant, but was good. Not many spots impressed me like this one did. Atmosphere and lighting were good. Oh and did I mention the music selection? All of that made a memorable experience.",

I showed up the moment the restaurant opened and got seated without a reservation within 5 mins. The interior is upscale, the waiters and staff know how to handle themselves around guests. I ordered fillet mignon and 2 sides: mushroom and potato.  After 45 mins of waiting (I was there by myself so clearly it seemed to be a very long time), I finally called the waitress to check the status of the dishes. She came back a minute later and said the food is almost ready, so 10 mins later I got the food. Veggies were delicious, much better than the steak :)  All in all, too pricey for the service I got - probably, won't return.",

    "text": "I went here with my fiance, and let me tell you that being a foodie and fan of Top Chef, this place is definitely one to go to.   This was a truly amazing meal and for this to be my first YELP ever I hope I do you Yelpers justice and don't forget anything.  We had a reservation for 9:00PM and waited at the bar until our table was ready, they were very prompt at seating us and got us a booth, we sat down and the waiter service was excellent, they got us the menus, the wait staff were all very knowledgeable and actually helped us to make our decisions.  Our waiter, Francisco advised us on the everything and asked us what are some things that we liked.  We decided NOT to go with the Chefs Tasting Menu as we weren't that hungry, because the portions are HUGE, so here is the detail of what we did have...  Bread:  They brought out these little pillows of bread in its own little baking tray, these things are AWESOME, soft and pillowy (is that even a word)! They had great texture, a little crispy on the top, very light and airy, and perfectly buttered and then sprinkled with a little kosher salt.  Sweet and salty and buttery all in one, I think we had about two or three trays of this stuff.  Appetizers:   Lobster bisque - we shared this and they even asked us if we wanted it in to be served in separate bowls which we did, and even then I still feel that it was a good sized portion, the bisque was flavorful and rich and creamy and smooth, with good amounts of lobster pieces in each bowl, my only regret is that I wish we got our own, because neither one of us wanted to share!!!!  Mains:  For me, I got the 16oz bone in rib eye, cooked to a perfect medium rare.    Fiance, got the Surf and Turf (Filet and  1/2 Lobster) also cooked to perfection.    Sides:  Hen of the Woods Mushroom - This was by far the BEST mushrooms that I have ever had and I LOVE MUSHROOMS, at first sight they didn't look too appetizing as they really don't look like your traditional mushroom side dish, but they are truly awesome, the texture is amazing, they were crispy and soft and chewy and melt in you mouth all at the same time, man I want some of these things right NOW, and the flavor wow I'M speechless.  Yukon Gold Puree - much better than your standard fair mash potatoes, creamy and buttery.    Desserts: We were WAY TOO FULL to have dessert, but from what we did see they looked amazing!  All in all this was one on the best dining experiences that I have ever had, and what's even better for me is that I have FINALLY turned my fiance into a foodie (she never really understood why I would watch the Food Network and Top Chef all the time) and now she wants to try out everything while we are here in Vegas.  My next review will be Hubert Keller's Burger Bar, but that's another awesome meal and review.    One last thing to mention as we were waiting for our check, at the table next to us sits down Pierre Gagnaire 3 star Michelin chef who just opened Twist restaurant at Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas, the perfect ending to a perfect dining experience.",

Unfortunately, we were complete idiots and decided to go to the Wynn Buffet for a late lunch that same day, and by the time dinner rolled around...none of us had an appetite.  [Before that, we had used whatever stomach space we had left to store some alcohol, of course.]    I ordered an appetizer - a cold, marinated mushroom salad.  I only managed to eat about 5 tiny mushrooms.  They were delicious, though.  My friends who had ordered \"real\" food enjoyed their dishes a lot...unsurprisingly, people raved about the steak.    I wasn't too sad about just eating mushrooms. ...Until I found out that it was owned by Top Chef's Tom Colicchio!  Now I want to kick myself every time I think about it.

    "text": "Had a lovely dinner here on a recent trip to Vegas - sad to say, the restaurant was only 30% full, much like the entire city, it seemed.  But, all in all, a good experience.  Service was friendly, efficient, and altogether non-obtrusive (although, ultimately, was the cause of my deducting a star...I'll get to that in a minute.)  Started with a well poured martini and the frisee salad - delicate frisee with sizable chunks of warm, smoky bacon, bleu cheese, and a warm champagne vinegarette.  It was a nice start to the meal, accompanied by warm fresh rolls that could have come from my grandmother's oven.  Delicious.  Ordered a bottle of Mollydooker and had the bone in ribeye cooked medium rare, ordered it on the rarer side of medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly.  Came out sizzling on its own small platter with a roasted shallot, and was seasoned to perfection, just enough salt, pepper, and (I believe) thyme.  Also ordered the side order of mushrooms (hen of the woods, shitake, and another that I am failing to remember - enoki, perhaps?) and the potato leek gratin - sinfully delicious.  My coworker ordered the shortribs, and really, really made me wish I had - although my steak was delicious, the shortribs were some of the best I'd tasted.  We finished sharing a delicate chocolate souffle with warm, perfect caramel sauce and ice cream.  Yum.  Not usually a dessert person, but it was really, really good.    While not among the best meals of my life, this would be a very solid choice if your carnivorous cravings strike while in Vegas.    So - why just A-OK?  Well...I know that times are a little tough in Sin City right now, but MGM has heavily advertised their winter tasting menus at all the restaurants.  Thus, while I was happy with my meal, what I really wanted was the tasting menu.  At an advertised $60 pp and $30 wine pairing, I was really looking forward to it.    However, when I asked our server about it, he said he'd never heard of it, and that the only tasting menus available were the kobe beef menus (part of the standard menu, from $135/pp - $255/pp before wine.)  Not the case, as it turns out.  That menu WAS availalble.  So, deducting a star for what I can only assume was either total stupidity or a deliberate gouge, turning my $90/pp dinner into $150/pp.  Either way - a star deducted.",

We also really enjoyed the broccolini.  The lobster bisque was creamy and pretty good, and the wagyu tar tar was unlike anything we've ever eaten.

They changed the bread basket to fresh baked rolls served in the cast iron pan they are baked in. The rolls are fluffy and filling...be careful not to spoil your appetite.

    "text": "Listen and Listen well. If you have a modicum of taste, if you have ever had a steak in Nebraska, if you like flavor, then aviod this poorly crafted steak place.  It's funny to think  that Collichio has the audacity to rip other chefs.  Craftsteak is no better than Outback.    There were so many infractions on the field here I dont know were to begin.    The first yellow card was waiting for an inordinately long time for service.  The waiter was slow and dilatory.  And, his explanation on mushrooms was not even an explanation.  I asked what types of mushrooms were listed and he said, \"just get the assortment you will get all the mushrooms then.\"  Thanks Casper, thats a hell of an idea.  I could have thought of that one myself.  But, I would still like to know what types of mushrooms I can anticipate.   The second yellow card, came with waiting after I had finished my beer.  I was not asked if I would like another until the meal was served.  That was 10min after I finished my first.    Two yellows is a red.  Now you are a man down.  The thrid, fourth, and fifth yellows came in quick succession.  Some idiot in the back went hog-wild with the Sea Salt.  I thought they pulled the cow from the bottom of Salt Lake.  Ya know Collichio a little salt goes a long way.   If there is a chef in the world who can actually impart flavor on to asparagus, then he aint working at Craftsteak.  You know make the veggies exciting.  I guess Toby from Top Chef said it right, \"its like the bland leading the bland.\"    The ribs and steak were not lean. They were infused with fat.  Our cows definitly had Type II diabetes.  They were the fatest cows in the lot.  Given their poor taste and texture, they were probably Nascar fans to boot.   I really wouldnt care so much but dont try to be a top notch steak house.  I've had better steaks in Portland, Omaha, and Worcester.   Save your money go for a mid range restaurant and buy your girl a nice gift.  But, dont even think about spending one moment in the most uncomfortable chair in the world just to eat this unsavory hodgepodge of mediocrity.  With so many infractions, all I can say is Chef Collichio please pack up your knives and leave.",

The meal I had at craftsteak last week was one of my top five meals ever...easily...and it was Vegas Restaurant Week.    Collicchio's menu had it goin' on.  The best part was that there was no choice involved because you were served EVERYTHING on the special menu.   A first course of roasted red peppers, arugula and some of the best prosciutto ever cured was paired with a delightful sparkling rose.  The main course was a trio of kobe beef sirloin, tender roasted chicken, and grilled diver scallops accompanied by yukon gold whipped potatoes (yum!), roasted sweet corn and sauteed shitake mushrooms and served with a perfect shiraz that surprisingly paired perfectly with each component.  The dessert was spectacular...and I am not usually a huge fan of sweet things.  Pineapple sorbet, mint chocolate chip ice cream, chunks of cantaloupe and pineapple, chocolate molten cake, and (my favorite) sweet monkey bread with a light caramel dipping sauce.  This course was paired with a lovely sparkling muscat.   W-O-W!  And wimpy portions these were not.  All courses were served family style and with just me and my fiance eating, we had plenty left over.  In explaining how full we were to his best friend he said, \"I left meat on my plate.\"  If you knew him you would understand that this has likely never happened!  Of course we did make the mistake of arriving early to sit at the bar and enjoy some appetizers.  The grilled Hawaiian shrimp were fabulous!  We also tried the kobe beef tartare, which was ok, but didn't blow us away.  The consistency was pate-like and I think we were both expecting chunks.   For two cocktails and two appetizers we ended up spending more than it was for one person to enjoy all of the aforementioned food and wine pairings.  The bar bill was $90 with tip, but the full menu was $50.07 plus $20.00 for the wine...a True steal!  I can't say enough about the service at craftsteak, either.  Fabulous!  The servers, bartenders, and hostesses alike were all informative, professional, relaxed, and definitely not stuffy.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and very classy.   Lovely...super...totally worth it!  The regular menu is definitely pricey, so try to hit one of these deals or eat an appetizer somewhere else beforehand if you don't want to splurge.  If you do, go for it and enjoy!",

If I was on death row, and they asked me what my last meal would be, one of those meals would definitely be a steak from Craftsteak. I truly believe this is the best steak I have had in my life. I ordered the Rib Eye Med. Rare and my friend got the New York Strip Rare. Both were  charred to perfection on the outside and oh so tender in the inside. The thyme accented the steaks very well. That little sweet shallot on my plate paired nicely. I savored every morsel of steak in my mouth. I didn't want this meal to end.   We also had the pleasure to enjoy the Asparagus and the Potatoes Gratin. The Asparagus was not overdone like most places do, and the tips were crispy! I don't know how they got the body so tender and the tips as crispy as they were, but good job! No, GREAT job!  The ambiance was very nice! My friend and I shared a table that had a little sofa on one side ( that shared with table next us) which I enjoyed thoroughly.  I sat on the other side with the most comfortable chair in my life! Haha Service was impeccable, but would you expect less from this restaurant's owner?  Definitely the best birthday dinner ever! =P",

They really did a nice job with it.  One of my problems was that the servers totally upsold us on the amount of food we would need.  I'm a good eater, but I was so full by the time the steak came out that I barely had time to finish it.  My recommendation would be to go with the steak and a side dish or two, skip the apps and then see if you have enough room for dessert.  Having said that, I thought the hanger steak was very good.  The meat certainly takes center stage, and is well seasoned, but not overly so.  The steak was tender and beefy, just like a thin hanger ought to be.  I'd go back, but would change the way I ordered to enjoy it more.",

I was insanely stuffed by the end of dinner... so I did not indulge in any of the desserts my friends did... however, I did witness them climaxing.

My 2 friends and I got the Wagyu beef prix fixe menu. This came with 3 appetizers; buffalo mozzarella with roasted red peppers and hazelnuts in a balsamic vinaigrette, hawaiian prawns, and a delicious caesar salad.  The main course - the steak - was wagyu beef served in 3 different cuts. We went with the chef's recommendation, strip steak, new york steak, and ribeye steak. The beef altogether was over 2 pounds of meat. Steak was served with shallots, and the sides were shiitaake mushrooms, hen of the woods mushrooms, and japanese white mushrooms. We also switched out the mashed potatoes for french fries, and got a roasted corn side. Delish!  Dessert put the whole meal over the top. We got raspberry, watermelon, peach, and cherry sorbet. Also got a peach cobbler with peach sorbet on it, a \"liquid\" chocolate cake served with cookies and cream ice cream, another interesting peach dish, and a bowl of fresh fruit.  Altogether with tax and tip, the meal came to $180 per person. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth, although I'm still having trouble breathing from the amount of food that I consumed. I'm going to take a nap and then have a steak baby.  Five stars, don't miss this place.",

But what my friend and I got was a steak that looked really good, but tasted oh so mediocre.  The steak lacked any kind of juiciness and at one part of the filet portion had this gummy, sticky consistency.  Not something you'd expect from a expensive, well known steakhouse.  The only thing that saved the steak was the sauce bernaise, which was excellent.  But in my opinion, a great steak should not need the help of sauce to taste good.  The rest of the meal was hit/miss.  The quail was one of the best I've tasted.  The Frisee salad was horrible -- way too much blue cheese.  the Hen of the Woods mushroom was pretty good.  but after all, this is a steak place and should be rated on its steak.  If the steak cost $20/person, I would give it 3.5 stars.  But at almost $40/person, 2 is the most this place deserves.",

    "text": "I was excited to go to Craftsteak because I am a huge Top Chef fan and it is Tom Colicchio's restaurant. Of course, he wasn't there, and is only there about 4x a year, but still... it was cool to be there! First of all, the restaurant is  gorgeous! It is decorated very cool and trendy. I liked how they had some repeating geometric patterns going on, and that there was just a subtle sophistication to it. It wasn't stuffy or fancy... just a very nice environment.  Now to the food: First of all, this place is $$! We would have never come here had they not had the winter tasting menu. It was a 3 course meal for $60/pp. On the menu they had a listing for apps, entrees, sides and then dessert. It mentioned it was family style so I assumed that everyone at the table would have to choose one for each category.  But I was pleasantly mistaken!!! Basically, you get everything! Everything, meaning, you got 3 apps, 3 entrees, 3 sides and 2 desserts! It was SO much food! I was so excited b/c I got to try EVERYTHING! When does that happen? They were also decent size portions... large enough that we really couldn't finish everything and we didn't feel bad.   Apps: We got to try the quail, which I had never had before and would have never ordered. It was delicious! So tender and perfectly seasoned with balsamic vinegar. There was also a yummy beet salad, a lettuce salad and a red pepper salad.   Entrees: Roasted Prime Flat Iron Steak: My favorite of the three. So tender and well flavored; Certified Angus Beef Skirt Steak: also, very good but I didn't really understand why we needed 2 cuts of beef; Diver Sea Scallop: Very tasty but nothing overly impressive.  Sides: Yukon Gold Potato Puree: My favorite! But how could you go wrong with this? Sauteed Shiitake Mushrooms: eh? just ok; Brussels Sprouts with Smoked Bacon: ditto  Desserts: For the desserts, they just give you random ones: We got this caramel nut roll... kind of like a cinnamon roll, served with caramel ice cream. It was really sweet, but tasty. My favorite was the other one, which was a chocolate lava cake served with espresso ice cream.   Overall, I loved that they gave us so much food! Everything was really fresh and high quality! It made for a really nice Vegas dinner. I will comment that the service was not outstanding, though. Still, I left Craftsteak very satisfied... and extremely full!",

Their dry-aged steaks are excellent and my friends who like wet-aged say they are very good as well.  An edge that Craftsteak has are its excellent side dishes.  The only one who outdoes the Yukon mashed potatoes is Robuchon and not by very much.  The only restaurant that has better creamed spinach is the DC Palm which has a different recipe for creamed spinach than all the other Palms in the U.S.  There was one occassion where the service was a bit slow but other than that it has always been an outstanding restaurant.

    "text": "An overall great experience at Craftsteak! I will have to disagree with the \"dressy attire\" on the top yelp profile... There were some diners who were dressed in almost \"prom attire\" then there was the drunk, wet people who stumbled their way from the pool in their ed hardy best and trucker hats. I guess if you come to dinner and pay close to $300 you should be able to wear whatever you want..  Our server, walter.. or was it wallace.. was great. He helped with wine pairing and course selection. The previous night another couple who we were in vegas with tried the tasting menu. She said it was the worst tasting menu ever and to stay far away from it. With that in mind the bf and I ordered from the dinner menu.  ::Appetizer:: Wagyu Steak Tar Tar ($22): Delicious! Absolutely Delicious! My boyfriend was a little hesitant in trying steak tar tar (we usually only have tuna tar tars) but that soon subsided when he tasted the creamy wagyu steak. It was topped with a quail egg and paired with crispy tiny bread. It was very good. The steak was so light and seasoned perfectly. I highly recommended everyone trying the steak tar tar (meat lovers only duhh..)  Surf n Turf ($62): Filet mignon with your choice of either half lobster, grilled prawns or diver sea scallops. I choose the scallops. I asked for my filet mignon medium rare, it came out medium... for a steak house with such an esteem reputation I would of expected that my steak would not be over cooked. I really couldn't complain though because the meat itself just melted in my mouth. One of the best filets I have ever had.   -Diver sea scallops: by far the best scallops hands down. 3 big scallops came next to my filet mignon. They were cooked perfectly and topped with a fennel salad. The presentation was amazing but the scallops were to die for!  My boyfriend had the Rib eye ($44) with a side of grilled asparagus ($12).  The rib eye was huge! The grilled asparagus easily can feed 2 people. He really enjoyed his rib eye.   For Dessert: -Sorbet ($6/each): We tried the Melon Sorbet and the Strawberry Sorbet. Best way to end dinner.. (each order of sorbet comes with 2 big scoops of sorbet. can be easily shared)  -Coffee: Served in a french press. For only $4, they give you about 4 cups of coffee..",

It started with our maitre d' asking if we wanted an alcoholic drink.  I decided to have sparkling water (two bottles in total) which I later came to find out was 8 bucks a piece.  It was a good addition to the rich food but helped our final bill climb. I can't remember all of the items that ended up coming to our table but every one of them was substantial and oh so tasty.  The mashed potatoes are a must have even if you are just having a steak get the potatoes you will enjoy them.  The meats including Wagyu skirt, strip and lobster melted in my mouth.  The lobster came with a parsnip butter sauce.  All I can say was oh my goodness.  It also came with the potatoes I mentioned earlier, asparagus, wild mushrooms and a grain of some kind.  When dessert came out they had brought several different plates and I was expecting to get to pick one.  OH NO they all were for me.  Cheese cake, two kinds of ice cream, chocolate mousse, seasonal berries and the ever so delicious monkey bread.  By the time the bill came it was just around 400.00 including tip.

My wife requested medium, but this was closer to medium rare. For someone who wants a medium temperature steak, getting it more towards rare IS actually a big deal. Sigh, and for the amount we paid, not worth it. The quality of the steak was also questionable. Service was attentive and atmosphere was pleasant.

But when the food came out and I took the first few bites, I was surprised to see how AVERAGE the food was. Honestly, I could have eaten as good at a place in the Bay for 1/10 the cost. A dinner for four girls ended up being nearly $500 (yes, we did get two bottles of wine, but neither were more than $50)...  I felt this place was completely over-priced for the quality of its food. I guess the place has a great \"name,\" and I think my friends loved it because they felt like they were 'supposed to,' but steer clear!

Unlike some Vegas restaurants, the atmosphere makes you feel as if you've truly escaped the casino madness and entered another world. The service is top notch and the food was outstanding. Their wine list is overwhelming, but if you look around you can find a decent bottle for under $100.   For appetizers we ordered oysters (fantastic!), the yellowtail hamachi (very fresh, although the citrus did overpower the fish a bit), and the lobster bisque (absolutely perfect - we ordered one to share for the table and they brought it to us in four small cups - nice touch).  I had the wagyu skirtsteak and it was by far the best skirtsteak I've ever eaten. The yukon potatoes were amazing and the fries were perfect.  For dessert I highly recommend the monkeybread - it was amazing and the pecan/brown sugar ice cream was so refreshing. I'm a huge chocolate fan but this dish was far superior to the chocolate tart we ordered, which came with maple bacon ice cream (didn't care for it, and I love bacon!).  Overall, one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Did I mention the bisque?  Five stars - huge fan!",

Nothing fantastic.  I've had better tasting steaks else where.  I even went all out and ordered the wagyu surf and turf tasting menu.  Came with ribeye and skirt steak.  Skirt steak was very stringy and chewy.  Thought I was eating some cheap steak from Denny's.  Only thing worth eating from the appetizers were the prawns.  Salad was a waste of time-wilted overly dressed.  The complaints can go on for days.  Service...it was okay.  I've had better.  It bothered me so much when the server did not know the exact details of the tasting menu.  I know it is up to the chef, but wouldn't the chef know what he wanted to put on the tasting menu when he starts cooking that day?  Everything was a mystery other than the fact we knew we were getting shrimp, lobster and ribeye and skirt steak.  But the most ridic. part is that he didn't know what was being served for dessert.  He genuinely did not know.  I had to request for some monkey bread for dessert bc that was the one thing everyone raved about.  Thank goodness I asked bc tables next to me did not have monkey bread on their tasting menu,  BOTTOM LINE: price tag DOES NOT MATCH THE FOOD QUALITY OR TASTE.",

    "text": "Wow, what a huge disappointment.  We had been looking forward to ending our trip with dinner at Craft after eating at some other fabulous places in Vegas.  Let's start with the positives: Ambiance - very nice Wait Staff - Friendly and Knowledgeable Overall Menu - Good selections and great wine list Portion size - all very large - when they tell you they are sharable, they mean it!  Then it all falls apart. Nothing, and I do mean nothing that we ordered was not in need of seasoning.  Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.  And I am sure it is some new trend with chefs but really, a Caesar Salad that I had to spend 10 minutes cutting up....really I don't want to work that hard for a salad and yet again needed seasoning.  Probably the most disappointing were the Filets which we both ordered medium rare.  No seasoning and we were expecting the filet to melt in your mouth.  These were not even close,   And finally, a screaming baby throughout our whole dinner!  After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.  $400 for a dinner that on a scale of 1-10 we felt we could generously give a 3.",

I jokingly bitched to my cousin Andrew what a shortcoming of theirs that sometimes I had to exert myself by pouring my wine (The wait staff were persistently adding wine to our glasses and perhaps, two or three times (sigh), I had to do it myself.)  Not to mention that the wait staff would immediately fold up any napkins off-handedly left at the table when someone would go to the bathroom.  Of course, I jokingly complained to Andrew how they would only fold the napkins on the outside of our booth (where they could easily reach them) and not fold the napkins left on the inside our booth, where they couldn't see them.  ha ha, how fastidious I can be.    Oh yeah, and the food was super-fabulous.  Our party of four got the tasting menu with the wine pairing.  We savored our food and wine so much that it became an epic, 3-hour affair.  Not once did the staff make any comments or innuendos that the table was needed for another party or that we should get going or anything like that.  Then they happily obliged and wrapped up our leftovers, so we could enjoy our great meal twice, later, as it happened, after a night of drinking.",

    "text": "I honestly loved this restaurant but the main reason one goes to a steakhouse is for, what else, steak. I was seated right away for my reservation and I started with a glass of Dr. Heidemanns Bergweiler Germany 2005 Riesling, which if anyone is a fan of Riesling like me, you would love this wine. They brought some warm, moist, and buttery rolls that were just delicious.  I started off with the Foie Gras. It was a nice chunk of warm Foie Gras with I believe some kind of sweet beet salad next to it. This dish was simply amazing. The flavor combination between the two just went with each other like Pb&j and was by far the best Foie Gras I have had. For my entree I ordered the Skirt Steak. It came out the way I ordered it, medium, but it just didn't hit the spot for me. It was very salty and the flavor just wasn't there. I told my server I was in Las Vegas celebrating my 21rst birthday and to my surprise they brought me there Vanilla Bean Cheesecake with Fig Compote & Sweet Cream and a glass of desert wine which was simply delicious. It made up for the steak.  Overall I would have given Craftsteak 5 stars but the whole reason for going to a steakhouse is for the steak and they failed in that department for me. Service was 5 stars throughout the dinner and enjoyed the ambiance a lot. The room is dark ,warm and sophisticated which I like in a steakhouse.",

    "text": "Several of my girlfriends and I went on a Friday night in August for a bit of a celebration of us all being in one place and looking darn fine.  My boyfriend managed to talk the hostess into giving us a table on about three hours' notice.  (I still have no idea how he managed that!)  We walked up about 5 minutes early and were seated immediately.  We all decided on the summer tasting menu, with most of us choosing to also have the paired wine flight, as well.  The meal is served family style, and the portions were just about perfectly sized.  Everything was beautifully fresh and prepared with skill.  The courses came out in good time - without being stacked up or leaving us sitting with nothing new for too long.  The wines were perfect.  The server was engaging and knowledgeable, but not obtrusive.  The decor was elegant and dark and airy.  Nothing is overdone here.  I wish I could tell you more about what exactly we ate, but we were having such a good time that I couldn't take notes.  The only downside to the whole experience was the roving photographer.  I really dislike when restaurants do that.  Otherwise, everything was very well done.  I thought the tasting menu to be an excellent value for the quality and sophistication of the meal.  This was not the most extravagant or elaborate meal I've ever had, but it was wonderful and flavorful - just extremely well done.  Everything allowed us to enjoy each other's company, and the food, with ease.",

The waitstaff was attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere was calm yet you didn't feel as if you had to whisper.  We choose the Waygu beef chef's tasting menu and every single item was decadently delicious.  Our favorite items were the skirt steak with cipollini onions and red wine reduction, the creamy grits with pancetta, gorganzolla and onions, and the assortment of roasted mushrooms.  We'd never heard of \"hen of the woods\" mushrooms, yet it now my new favorite mushroom.  It was a perfect dining experience.",

They were so good that I literally inhaled 5 rolls (amidst the snickers of my dinner mates) before I had to stop myself.  And to be honest, the only reason I stopped was because we were going clubbing afterwards and I was wearing a super tight dress...  Sigh.  The sacrifices we make for beauty.  So now to the dinner part--we ordered the 32 ounce Rib for 2 and a selection of sides, including the assorted mushrooms (good), fries (very good), asparagus (OK), sauteed baby broccoli (a bit mushy), wild mushroom risotto (too thick and slightly over-cooked) and Brussels sprouts (OK).  The steak was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  I'd definitely come back again.",

    "text": "The short version of this review is: this place damn near made my eyes roll back in my head from pleasure.  Longer version: I hit the bar with a friend while we wait for the rest of our party and start with my fav aperitif, a negroni. Bartender makes an excellent one, not quite as good as the one I had at Locanda Locatelli in London (best negroni ever) but still pretty fine. Oysters were delicious, rest of the party arrives and we move to our table already in a great mood.  We shared two appetizers, the yellowtail hamachi - which I loved but some at my table were not so fond of the citrus garnishes on it (I want to say it was maybe mandarin), and the charcuterie sampler which was a hit all round. Sometimes you can't go wrong with the simple apps.  Then the steaks. I had the filet and others at my table had the new york and the sirloin, and before long it was musical chairs...only with steaks. We all passed them around a bit and tried each one -- all were great, purely a matter of personal preference. Great steaks were to be expected though, the real surprise was how good the sides were. Aside from the fingerling potatoes which were a bit bland (but how much can you really do with a fingerling?), the wild mushroom risotto, the soft polenta and blue cheese and the mushroom assortment were all spectacular.  Throw in a nice bottle of Flowers Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir and you've got a bunch of pretty happy campers  At the end there was some dessert but I really don't remember what it was -- by that point I was soaked in food bliss. Can't say enough about the service either -- feels like there were three of four people working our table over the course of the evening over and above our principal waiter. All very attentive, courteous and professional but never overbearing.  Not bad, Colicchio. Not bad at all. Even if you are mildly annoying on TV.",

The restaurant was beautiful and the staff attentive, but I did feel like they were pushing the salesmanship a bit, over recommending things to up the bill.  I don't mind this, but they were just a little over the top and it really felt trained an somewhat fake.  This was our least favorite meal during our stay in Vegas and the most expensive.  With a couple of apps and two sides with one glass of wine for me our bill came to 379 with tip without dessert.  We also did not order Kolbi, this was regular dry aged steak.   It was an anniversary gift from family and I was sorry I didn't enjoy it more.  It really wasn't worth it flavor wise.  I've had much better food at lesser priced steakhouses.",

I felt with the standard he holds on Top Chef  any establishment with his name on the door would have to be outstanding.  I unfortunately was very dissapointed.  The lobster bisque had nice flavor although it was lukewarm, the pieces of lobster were cold on the inside and there were pieces of shell in almost every bite. The steak had no seasoning at all and with the lack  of flavor it was also a very tough piece of meat. My husband ordered the mushroom assortment and it was under cooked ( hard in fact) and flavorless.  I understand from our waitor that Mr. Colicchio comes no more than a few times a year,  he may want to have a stronger interest as it is a reflection on him.  All that being said while I would not recommend or go back, I am still a huge fan, but Tom please pack your knives and go!",

    "text": "Two words for you -- \"salt\" and \"butter.\"  That is the key to all their food.  They do not add a lot of fancy sauces but try to let the natural flavors of their food speak for themselves.  They season their dishes with generous amounts of salt and butter making everything very rich and flavorful.  We enjoyed both the rack of lamb and a rib eye steak with three sides.  That is a good amount for two people.  Maybe three sides was a bit much and could have easily have gone with two.  If you get the dessert, go with the chocolate souffle.  It is \"worth skipping a few bites of your meal to make room for it\" good and to me was the highlight of the experience.  The atmosphere is what brought my experience from 5 stars to 4.  For starters, it is somewhat loud.  There are a lot of hard surfaces that just reflect sound and nothing to really absorb it.  Also, they play blues and country music in the background which sort of cheapens the atmosphere.  I felt like the waiters were going to come out at any minute and do a line dance in the aisles.  The food was excellent, although I do question the high prices of everything.  I feel like many people praise Craftsteak because they spent $50+ for a steak and another $15+ for side dishes.  It was good, but I've had decent steaks at half the price elsewhere.  But hey, this is Las Vegas and if you going to spend hundreds of dollar on something it might as well be a fine meal instead of losing it at the craps tables.",

    "text": "With all the famous and celebrity-chef owned restaurants in Vegas, it was a tough decision to decide which restaurant the bf and I were going to go to.  I've always wanted to check out Craftsteak (my love of Tom Colicchio and Top Chef) and the chance finally came!  Reservations seem to fill up quickly, especially with the pre-theater folks so I would suggest trying to make them early.  I ended up having to go with a 5:30pm reservation on a Saturday and when we finally found the restaurant (maze-like MGM) - I was so confused because it was EMPTY. ::shrug::  The menu is changed and printed daily based on what produce was available that day.  There are non-steak options, but who comes to a steak restaurant and doesn't order steak!?  I had a raspberry martini - brought in a mini shaker and poured table side - - really refreshing but a touch too sweet.    After looking at pictures of the dinner rolls on Yelp I couldn't wait for our server to bring them out.  I don't know what they put in their rolls but they're seriously addicting.  They're baked in the kitchen and served hot in a mini cast iron pan with clarified butter and sea salt on top.  THEY WERE SO FREAKIN GOOD!!!  After the bf and I polished off the first 6 I secretly was hoping they would bring out more and BAM! - 6 more appeared on our table (I took those bad boys to go!).  We decided to split the kobe beef tartare for our appetizer - - it's served with crostini and a raw quail egg - it was really yummy and flavored perfectly.  The bf decided to go with the ribeye and I had the surf and turf (filet and my choice of prawns).  Both our steaks were cooked to the perfect doneness and were so tender.  For our side we went with the roasted fingerling potatoes - really good sized portion for splitting and delicious!    Normally I'm so stuffed that I can't possibly eat dessert but I managed to make some room.  Craftsteak's monkeybread with banana ice cream is the most popular dessert on their menu and for good reason.  It was so good!!!  I found myself really savoring each bite.  The banana ice cream was the perfect sweetness to balance out the monkeybread.  Service was on point (as it should be).  Very friendly and knowledgable servers.  Yes this meal definately put a dent in the bank account but I'm still full thinking about it and those freakin delicious rolls!  (Tom Colicchio if you're reading this, can I have the recipe????)",

    "text": "Once again you did not disappoint CRAFTSTEAK. We were so excited to take our friends here but also concerned whether we had over-hyped our first experience here.   We did the 3 course wagyu tasting (grade 7 meats) for $140pp. However among us four, they allowed us to do 3 orders which was more than enough food.   To start off, they have these fresh mini sweet buns that are served fresh from the oven-melt in your mouth yummy.  Next 4 appetizers were served: prawns, buffala mozzarella & hazelnut, frissee salad with blue cheese & bacon( delicious, one of our favorites), wagyu tar tare.  Next came the wagyu filet mignon, rib-eye, and the New York strip. Of course, the best cut and most well prepared was the filet mignon, medium rare and melt in your mouth good. However, from our last trip, the skirt steak was our favorite and still is. It was prepared to perfection and it was infused with flavor in every bite despite its lower grade. Who would've thought. Our strip did come out overdone, but we sent it back and a medium rare piece came out quickly and perfectly.  As our sides, we got the mushroom assortment, Yukon gold mash, and the garlic spinach. The highlight was of course the Yukon gold mash potatoes- creamy, buttery goodness - which was raved by all other Yelpers. Among us four we couldn't finish our 3 cut of meats.  Lastly, we had 6 desserts that came out. It should've been 5 but our waiter forgot our request for monkey bread and brought out another dessert by mistake. Don't worry we don't mind the extras.;) We tried a variety of sorbets, cheesecake, monkey bread, apple fritters, and their bread pudding. Surprisingly, the highlight for me was the cheesecake. It was extremely light, fluffy and creamy served with blood oranges. So yummy. My hubby liked the Apple fritters most this time compared to the monkey bread which was his favorite on the last visit.  Overall, another pleasant and enjoyable dining experience with great company. This will probably continue to be our go-to restaurant for steak.",

    "text": "For a girls' weekend in Vegas, we thought we'd splurge one night and treat ourselves to a fantastic dinner. Boy oh boy did craftsteak deliver! From the moment the hostess greeted us until we left, service was top notch. We started with amazing cocktails and nibbled on the most tender dinner rolls that had just the perfect amount of salt on top. However, I knew better than to stuff myself with bread - a fine assortment of delicacies awaited us.    We had a wide variety of appetizers including: baby artichokes, buffalo mozzarella, Caesar salad (even the anchovies were deelish), grilled quail, frisee salad with bacon and Gorgonzola, the charcuterie sampler and last but most definitely not least, the Wagyu beef tartare. My taste buds swooned with each bite. Was it possible that each item got better and better? How would I make it through the meal? I'd have to say that the charcuterie sampler (served with some of the most amazing mustards I have ever had, including one made with red currants) and the Wagyu beef tartare were simply divine. Whew - I have to take a breather, I'm salivating just thinking about this meal again.   For our main entrees we ordered skirt steak (well done) and the filet mignon and scallop surf and turf (rare.) Allow me to preface this by saying that I like my meat very very rare - I like to hear a faint moo as I chew. But since we were sharing the dish we compromised on the how well-done the steaks would be. Oh my! The skirt steak was amazing. It had a slightly crunchy and salty outer layer and was so tender and flavorful inside. The scallops were ginormous and were sweet and tender and tasted just like a scallop should. They were not smothered in a sauce nor were they overly seasoned. The filet mignon was heaven. I had forgotten what real beef tasted like. It melted in my mouth. It was perfect. For our sides we thoroughly enjoyed: sauteed broccoli, Yukon gold puree, chanterelles and mushroom risotto. The broccoli was cooked perfectly, it had a nice bite. I am constantly amazed at how many restaurants cannot prepare the simplest foods. The Yukon gold puree was like velvet. The chanterelles bursted with flavor and last but definitely not least the mushroom risotto. What a symphony! The risotto was spectacular. It was topped with an assortment of sauteed mushrooms that had a slightly crispy texture which played nicely with the creaminess of the risotto. Each grain was cooked to perfection - no gumminess or uncooked surprises.  Food this flavorful does not need elaborate preparation. The freshness and quality of the food was apparent. The chefs clearly demand quality from their farmers and ranchers. I was pleased to learn that the majority of the food was grown in California, which isn't exactly local, but c'mon, Vegas is the desert, not going to expect a whole lot of truly local produce.  Oh wait, I almost forgot, dessert. Most steakhouses tend to fall short on their dessert offerings; however, this was not the case with craftsteak. We ravished the cinnamon sugar doughnut holes that were served with an orgasmic Meyer lemon mousse and huckleberry preserve. The sorbets and ice creams (pear, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla bean, espresso and cherry and chocolate flake) were bursting with flavor and weren't overly sweet. The dark chocolate lava cake had a lot of rich cocoa without being too heavy. Perhaps the best part were the cookies. Crispy pecan praline cookies were served with a decadent butterscotch mousse. We broke the cookies and dipped them into the mousse. Bliss.  This was truly one of the best meals I have ever had - a night that I (and my taste buds) will remember always.",

    "text": "I honestly don't know what to make of CraftSteak. I'm a huge Top Chef fan and CraftSteak was the first reservation I made when I decided to go to Vegas. First of all can I just say how creepy it is to stare directly at a painting of a cow with the words \"Sirloin\" written on it while I'm eating a steak. I'm not by any means vegetarian but I'm not going to go eat my fried chicken next to the chicken coop. Im sure most people appreciate the ironic art but I wasn't a fan. The old-school lights were neat. That's about it.   Husband got the raw oysters, he thought they were great. I had the lobster bisque. It was just okay and the licorice herb on top might have been more complimentary if it was chopped finer. I got a big mouthful and it ruined the rest of the soup for me. The husband had to finish it. I will say, the steak was hands down the best steak I've ever had. If I remember correctly it was an aged T-Bone. I usually like my steaks seared with a nice crust but this just melted in my mouth and the drippings in the bottom of the pan made my eyes roll back in my head. We ordered the mixed mushrooms and the zucchini as sides and neither were impressive. The chocolate souffle with caramel and hazelnut ice cream was worth every penny.   The service was odd. Apparently we had two waiters but I never saw the second except for at the beginning and when we were leaving and some of our food was delivered by a random third person. Our main waiter was super nice but I have a hard time with accents in loud restaurants and couldn't understand what he was saying half the time and then when I asked him what the licorice-y herb was that was on my soup and the steak, he told me it was rosemary. I really don't think it was.   So three stars... IF I ever went again I'd probably just order a steak and dessert and leave happy.",

My party and I ordered two porterhouse for two. It was good quality meat BUT the cooking mode did not enhance the meat; maybe because my husband and I have been spoiled with the way Peter Luger cooks it...really seared.  Overall, an 'OK' because the quality and freshness of the food, including the salads and side dishes, were very good. But that was the case in other nice restaurants we tried.  We had high expectations and the restaurant did not meet it. Big fans of Tom Colicchio!",

Our waiter Marvin was incredibly knowledgeable and had a great attitude and took care of us real well.  He guided us through the menu, but we wanted to keep it somewhat basic.  There were 4 of us...2 filets and 2 rib eyes.  All were cooked exactly as requested.  The sides were sweet corn and Marvin's recommendation, the risotto.  I couldn't believe it, but every bite I took of anything was just better than the next!  Drinks were refilled without request.  Tom Colicchio's concentration on quality meat and seasonal vegetables were evident as everything tasted great.  Just an amazing steak dinner.  I'm not too sure about spending the $200+ per person, but if I was to try it anywhere I would do it here.",

Craftsteak had the holy trifecta of steakhouse goodness--a wide selection of choices w.r.t steak (i.e. every cut, size, and cooking style you could want), delicious sides, and a hearty wine list. As I ate my braised short ribs (cooked for many hours in a low simmer of fatty goodness), sipped my malbec, and partook of the fingerling potatoes / baby spinach / kale / chanterelle mushrooms in the center of our table, I found myself drifting into a blissful state. The decorations are reminiscent of Chicago steakhouses--heavy on the dark colors, leather materials, and ruddy wooden tables and chairs. I felt encased in a womb of beefy goodness. If you're ever on the Strip, I recommend coming here for a strip...steak.",

Anyway, it was Friday night and crowded but we had reservations after seeing Ka. Bread was good but not to die for like folks said. We ordered kobe skirt steak, angus filet, corn, potato puree, and mushrooms. Steaks good but not worth price they charge -- I get better beef a our local Beef Palace in Huntington Beach (look it up for best steak in OC). Corn and puree pretty tasty but the mushrooms tough, dry and rubbery..c'mon $15 bucks for that crap. BTW, we sat before the two parties on either side of us and they got served first. Wasn't too thrilled to have all the bar folks standing up behind me while I ate.   Good gracious, I should've gone and tried Vic Anthony's.

    "text": "Ate here for dinner this week, I was super excited to try it because the menu looked great and I heart Tom Collicio on Top Chef, but the results were dissappointing.    Pros:  Got the domestic wagyu skirt steak, it was de-lish.   The portion sizes were huge, neither me nor my friend could finish our steaks. Wine list was good (although expensive) but not just overpriced cheap wine - the wine selections were all $16+ glasses of decent wines.   Cons:  We were not seated until half an hour after our reservation. Generally slow and not very friendly service, the ambiance felt like a good old boys club.  The waiter kept walking away while we were still talking to him. The side dishes were very plain.  Spinach ($12) was just that - a big pile of cooked spinach with not much flavoring.  Mushrooms ($12-16) were much the same.  No presentation to the food to speak of at all.   The worst part about it all was that the steak was so big that it took us a while to work our way through it, and when it got cold, the oil and grease it was cooked with kind of congealed with the fatty-ness of the meat and I just couldn't eat it anymore because it tasted so oily and fatty.  If they are going to give such large portions of such fatty meat, they need to think of a way to keep it warm, or at least not let the fat congeal while you are eating it.   Seemed a bit overpriced for what we got.",

    "text": "I'm ready for some meat!  Since the bf and I watch all the cooking reality shows, we wanted to give a Top Chef-related restaurant a try.  We did the Wagyu beef 3 course tasting menu at $130 a pop, and boy, was it worth it.    1st course: -Frisee salad with soft boiled egg, huge chunks of bacon, and some kind of bleu cheese dressing -Fresh buffalo mozarella -Prosciutto with a fig compote -Fresh avocado slices drizzled with olive oil, salt, and pepper (Towards the end we started rolling everything up in the prosciutto - SO GOOD!  Note: We'd been offered grilled prawns or Kobe tartare, but bf is allergic to shellfish and we're not big on raw meat.)  2nd course: -Filet (ordered it medium, but it came out more medium rare..melted in the mouth) -Rib eye (chewier, but more flavorful) -Sweet white corn (super yummy and buttery) -Potatoes au gratin (just OK...should've gotten the potato puree) -Assortment of mushrooms (wasn't feeling this one...too woodsy for me)  3rd course: -Monkey bread with banana ice cream (the ice cream tasted just like banana bread!) -Homemade sorbet (pink lemonade and peach) with fresh fruit -Molten chocolate cake with fresh whipped cream (was a little dry)  Totally worth it considering the steaks alone would've cost about $220.  You get basically half portions of the starters and sides.  Our waiters were totally awesome...basically handed us the menu and told us to pick what we wanted for each course (in case we weren't sure if we'd like the chef's choices).  The service was fantastic...our glasses were never more than half empty. :)  It was a little dim inside, though....but aren't they all?",

The mini rolls were yummalicious as well as the Braised short ribs (cooked 24 hours and like butta)  and potato puree. Finished the evening with an outstanding Monkey Bread and banana ice cream dessert. Soooo, not expecting the wonderful vibe, atmosphere and delicious food but it was all there. Thanks again Alex!",

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant now on 3 occasions. The first time was EXCELLENT! Wonderful service, great food and very enjoyable. The second time was also very good, but my friend did not enjoy her meal as much. And then there was this last time I went which prompted this review. Here are the details:  I was with a Party of 8 We were ordering lots of wine, appetizers, salads and food - we had money to spend. Service was terrible! They never brought us any bread. We had to pour our own wine the whole evening and would have ordered more if they checked on us.  They didn't change our plates out between appetizers and salad - we had to ask them to do it - and the servers barely checked in on us. The last time I came the service was excellent. This time it was appalling for a restaurant of this caliber. I've had better service at Denny's!  The food was just okay and some of it, like the lobster we ordered as an appetizer for the table, was tough, chewy and just not good! Extremely disappointing! The steaks were pretty tasty and for the most part pretty good but no better or distinguished than any other steaks from a high end steak house.  I was embarrassed. I had such a good experience before and recommended this place to my friends who all have serving experience and dining experience and this place was such a disappointment this time around. All I kept thinking was that if Tom Colicchio knew the low quality of service and the quality of some of the product coming out, he would be very disappointed and not want his name on this.   I will not be recommending this place again, nor will I be going back. With all the fine dining experiences I could have in Vegas, I'm not wasting any more money on this place. Too bad. My first experience was so good. Look elsewhere if you want a fine dining experience.",

The dinner also came with prawns for appetizers and 4 sorbets/liquid chocolate cake for dessert.  The food was great. Very well seasoned so I didn't need to add anything, which is rare. The appetizers were simple but tasty. The meat was perfectly med-rare-med. Both the rib-eye and flank were excellent and were like butter. The sides were tasty as well. The potato puree was awesome and balanced out the meat well. Dessert took some effort after a big meal but it was really good. The sorbet assortment were refreshing and the liquid chocolate cake and creme brulee were ridiculous caloric intake but worth it.  The service at Craft stood out to me. Our server's name was Kevin and couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. The staff was very professional and knew what they were doing leading to seamless transitions between courses. Amazingly polite and didn't rush anybody to finish and get the hell out. We got to relax and enjoy it all.  Great eating experience from the food to the service to the decor. Would definitely visit again.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of enjoying a dinner at Craftsteak while in Las Vegas for a week long business trip, which meant catered meals galore. So a few friends and I snuck over to Craftsteak one night and I'm so glad we did! Everything we had was very good!  We had reservations and were immediately seated at our table and served piping hot bread rolls which I jumped right into! They were warm and with the accompanying better, were a great way to start perusing the menu. The restaurant provided a few recommendations and finally we ordered a warm frisee salad and a baby beets & pickled egg salad. For our main course, we ordered a 10 oz. filet for myself, as well as the \"surf & turf\", which included a 6 oz. filet and your choice of scallops or lobster or prawns and so my party ordered one with the diver sea scallops and the other with the half Maine lobster. For our sides, we selected the asparagus with lemon & thyme, as well as the mushroom risotto with butternut squash.  The restaurant ambiance was nice and we enjoyed a few glasses of wine while we waited for our meal to arrive. The warm frisee salad was delicious served with a farm egg right on top of the salad which was tossed with blue cheese and chunks of bacon. As simple as the salad was, it was very fresh and the taste was simply amazing and unique.. I opted not to enjoy the poached egg (not my personal preference), but someone else in my party did and loved it! The beet salad I sampled from was also very good, with a selection of red & golden beets. I considered ordering it for myself but am glad that I opted for the warm frisee salad instead as it was a better choice!  Our main entrees were served shortly after and we were all impressed with our meals!  My filet was served medium well (and appropriately butterflied). Not only was it perfectly cooked, but it was truly delicious. The accompanying sides added a great touch to the meal. But the mushroom risotto with the butternut squash was to die for! It was not only a very generous serving (which I so gladly went back for seconds and thirds) but the taste was unlike any other risotto I've had. It was delicious and had I not been so full, I would have finished every last bite of it! Unfortunately, this meant no room for dessert for any of us. Oh and those that enjoyed their \"surf and turf\" also loved their accompanying surf items - the scallops were the best they had ever had and the lobster was also amazing.  So glad I was able venture out of my business trip and truly enjoy a great meal at Crafsteak. Definitely recommend it!",

Good salads, although the goat cheese option truly is just that, one lovely warm baseball sized portion of goat cheese.  Thanks to my pals, I was able to make a salad out of a few bites from their plates, and was a happy camper.  Range of sides, mostly carboliscious goodness of potatoes and the like.  We ordered some of the others that the south beach types like me in the group could enjoy -- they were fine, but nothing outstanding (asparagus, brussel sprouts, mushrooms), but a tad too much oil.  Of - the monkey bread smelled like garlicky goodness, but I can only report my dining companions seems to enjoy.   The short ribs were another good entree standout.  Steaks I think were fine, but not as much to write home about as one would think from a steak house.  The butterscotch dessert (one bite!) was lovely - blend of salty/sweetness.  Don't bother buying the photos -- as Jen L noted -- they are blurry!",

Luckily, there was still a craftsteak at the MGM Grand.  I LOVED IT.  We started with the beet salad with pickled egg.  Amazing.  The egg was different but worked with mixed with the beets.  My friend and I then shared the Kobe beef skirt steak and the bison, with mashed potatoes and a corn mixture for side.  It was all awesome.  The Kobe steak was the best steak I have ever had.  I found the bison to be a little chewy but overall still good.  I love the corn, I could have liked the bowl clean.  The mashed potatoes, well, how can you go wrong with mashed potatoes.  We were so stuffed we didn't get dessert but it all looked amazing.  If I am ever in Vegas again, I can't wait to return to this restaurant.  Happy Eating!",

The ribeye steak was terrific and the beef short ribs were so succulent that they were falling apart on the plate and melting in your mouth.  Although you had to order the sides seperately, they were well worth it as they were both delicious and in generous portions.   The bar also had a really extensive collection of single malt scotchs and the bartender was knowledgable, friendly and even though very busy, he took the time tell us about the different types that we might like.   He recommended his variation on the classic side car and it went perfectly with the meal.    Craftsteak will be our choice for steaks  in Vegas from  now on.",

Everything here is great but those are my top picks. If you're lucky enough to go during the summer season, you MUST TRY the sweet corn. It's one of their staples and I know why!

The waiters were very friendly and are ready to recommend items if you ask them to.   Before I went, I read all the reviews, so we ordered the following:  Beef Ribeye - a huge portion, it can feed two people easily Beef Skirt Steak - best flavor and best value for your money, I think Kobe Syle Wagyu Beef Ribeye - so tender Caesar Salad - good its just a salad; the  warm frisee looked better (next time!) Diver Sea Scallops - good but nothing to crave Beef Tartare - first time I've had it and it was amazing! Lobster Bisque - very rich depth of flavor, with a lot of good-sized lobster pieces. We asked if one order could be put into two bowls and the waiter just gave us two full servings (lobster and all) for the price of one! Baby Spinach - meh, bland Mushroom Assortment - decent Yukon Gold Puree - good, don't want to think about how much cream/butter went in  We had a TON of leftovers. The next day, thinly sliced steak between nice bread was good good good. Plan on having steak for lunch and quite possibly for dinner again the next day. I'm not a huge fan of steakhouses quite honestly, because I think steak can only be so good, as opposed to smaller plates that allow a chef to show off skill and creativity. However, if I had to choose a steakhouse to go to, I would recommend this one.",

I highly reccomend.  I had the 14oz boneless prime rib. I'm one of those freaks that doesn't like his prime rib too pink. I made the waiter aware I wanted medium, very little pink. Usually, I have to have it go back once because of this picky preference of mine, but this one arrived perfectly cooked and bigger than my head. The meat was perfectly tender and seasoned deliciously. Rarely do I not finish, but I was defeated by this massive slice of heaven and had to stop with about 6 bites to go.   My girl had the surf and turf - filet with lobster. As good as mine was, I could not help but yearn for hers, which was also on point.   Friendly staff, great food, but Delmonico at the Venetian still tops the list of Vegas steakhouses for me.",

We ordered 2 bottles of wine and lots of food. I remember the hangar steak and the caesar salad was soooo good.  And the chef made us a special dessert with all these different kinds of ice creams and toppings.  We actually ended up ordering more than we could even eat, and I think it came to about $50 a person, so not too pricey either.   I would highly recommend this place for a nice dinner with a group of 4 or more that enjoy simple, fresh food prepared well.",

    "text": "I think I've officially found my favorite steak house in Vegas.  So I was in town for my 20 year H.S. reunion (am I really getting that old???) and as usual, I always hit at least one steak place on each trip.  I've tried n9ne, Brand steak house, Carnevino, and Cut, but boy am I glad I went to Craftsteak this time around.    Made reservations and showed up right on time.  Sat at bar for a bit while they got our table ready, no biggie.  We were seated promptly and while we were checking out the menu, they brought out some piping hot, fresh bread for the table.  The bread was outstanding!   So light and fluffy, just the right sprinkling of salt on top and with just  a touch of butter, I knew I was in for a great night.  Between the 3 of us, we ordered the Lobster Bisque, Hanger steak, Kobe Skirt steak, and the braised short ribs.  We also ordered the fingerling potatoes, corn, and potato gratin.  I love when a server makes recommendations and he kindly recommended the potato puree instead of the gratin.  I wasn't married to the gratin, so upon his recommendation, we went that route.    The food.....glorious food.  The lobster bisque was quite simply one of, if not the best I've had.  Not too bold tasting, just right and silky smooth.  It also comes with like 3 ounces of lobster meat.  Can you say lobster in every bite?  Fantastic start.  When the steaks showed up, everything was cooked perfectly.  Now I've never gone to a steak place and ordered any other steak than Ribeye.  I tried the Kobe skirt only because it's a house specialty.  It did not disappoint.  It was amazingly tender, rich beef flavor, and all around a fantastic steak.  I was extremely happy with my choice.  My friend had the short ribs which were also amazingly tender and full of flavor.  His wife had the hanger steak and I was surprised at how tender it was.  All of the beef was excellent.  The sides as well were great.  The corn was very sweet and crisp, not over done.  The fingerling potatoes were nice and hot, perfectly seasoned, and had a nice texture with the skin still on.  As for the server's recommendation for the potato puree.......perfect!   So smooth, rich, and buttery.  All in all, it was an amazing meal leaving none of us wanting anything different.  I will definitely be back.",

Minus one star for telling us that we'd have enough time to eat before the show.  Our reservation was at 8:30 and we weren't seated til 8:50; we had show tix at 10:30 at Crazy Horse Paris.  Therefore we were totally rushed and didn't have enough time to eat everything and when you're paying about $100/person, that's a major issue.  If I go back I'll make sure I don't have plans afterwards.  The steak was amazing and one of my favorite things was the sweet potato puree... so awesome!  The desserts weren't as memorable, but maybe that's because we had to rush through them.",

    "text": "I went here a few nights ago and there was 4 of us for dinner. We couldn't decide on what to order, since everything on the menu looked so good. After much back and forth, we finally decided to get the chef's selection domestic wagyu. For the Chef's selection, the nice thing about it is, you had to order a minimum of 2 orders, but you didn't have to order for one per person if that makes sense. We had 4 people and we did 3 orders of the domestic wagyu plus the lobster bisque.   We didn't know what we were going to get, so it was all a surprise. The plate of warm salted bread came out first and I thought that was okay, it was very soft, but it tasted a little dry. Next came out the lobster bisque, even though we just ordered one, our waiter brought out a small bowl for the other 3 to try as well, so I thought that was really nice of him. Next came our appetizers, we had a salad, heirloom tomatoes and there was one more dish, but I can't seem to remember what it was. After the appetizers came our steak, we got 3 different cuts, the filet mignon, the skirt steak and the rib eye with 3 sides, the potato puree, the brentwood corn (YUM!) and then assorted mushrooms. My favorite was by far the filet mignon, it was so tender, I could cut it with the back of my knife. The skirt steak had a great flavor to it and I think our ribeye may have been cooked medium well, vs the medium rare that we ordered. We didn't finish our steak between 4 people, we were pretty stuffed already and no one really knew if we were getting dessert. 5 minutes later we got 5 dessert dishes, boy were we in for something we couldn't finish. We got an assorted ice cream, mixed fruits, creme brulee, a chocolate cake and finally monkey bread. After this meal I think we all had food coma!   I would definitely come back here! the food is so delicious and I think I would probably try a different chef's selection next time.",

We ordered fingerling potatoes, steamed spinach, and shiitake mushrooms as our sides. Spinach was definitely the highlight. Very bright and fresh.  Now the important part, the steak. 16 oz Strip. It was delivered with bone, which was nicely cut away from the flesh. The meat was tender, very flavorful, and the right amount of fat. Cooked to a perfect medium rare temp.",

I guess olive oil, and not much else. There were little globs of something else that probably was supposed to add flavor (bright red in color), but didn't. The only flavorful moment was when one little leaf of anise flavored tarragon managed to work it's way into the mix. My filet was done to perfection and delicious, but the scallops were slightly over done. My husband's $56 ribeye was only about 3/4\" thick and didn't taste as good as the supermarket cut we had barbequed ourselves last week. The risotto was delicious. The shiitake mushrooms didn't even look like shiitake. We come from Portland and eat wild shiitake all the time... The brussel sprouts were bitter and the bordelaise sauce was invisible. In summary: The meat was pretty good, but the side dishes were a total fail.  I do have to compliment the service. It made the experience itself special, even if the food didn't. However, $100+ per person should include wonderful food. Next time we'll try Gordon Ramsey.",

    "text": "This place is definitely worth the money and the experience.  My boyfriend and I are very picky eaters, and this is my first rating EVER with 5 stars! Beautiful place, fantastic service, definitely hats off to the chef. My boyfriend bought tickets for KA right in MGM near Craftsteak, and they asked us if we'd like to throw in a 3 course meal at Craftsteak for $50/person, which was supposed to be $100/person, damn was it worth it.  The place doesn't even need to use butter or tons of oil for every dish to make it extremely good, like many other places. I mean, who can't cook well if they're throwing a stick of butter in everything? They didn't even need too much sauce or anything, they had the distinct flavors cooked into each and every bite. The chef's got skill- believe me! When we went, we expected to be given just 3 different dishes per person, which we choose out of a few choices for each course. Instead, they just gave us the whole chef's taster! And it wasn't like every dish was the size of my palm like most expensive places - some were small, but some were large, and we had plenty to take home. It was definitely enough to feed 4.  These were the dishes we got:  Appetizer:  bread - they make it themselves, and they give you 2 kinds! yummm Salad - this was just plain salad with watered down dressing :p the only dish which wasn't superb. But as if you were gonna come here just for salad! Quail - soooo delicious. Tasted like really good steak, yet it was quail! Roasted Red peppers - Considering it was just red pepper slices, it  was surprisingly good.  Main Course:  Diver Scallops - so buttery and fresh you'd never guess you were in a desert. Free range Chicken -  Kind of bland. Okay fine the other dish that wasn't superb. Hangar Steak - thin, salty, peppery crust on the outside, cooked medium rare on the inside. The BEST dish, alongside the quail  Side dishes:  Yukon Puree - THE most buttery mashed potatoes you'll ever find!  There was actually melted butter floating on top of the whole dish. It was so pureed it was like a heavy cream.  Braised Asparagus - I've never tasted asparagus that I couldn't stop   eating. It was almost melt-in-my mouth good - cooked for the perfect amount of time, it was neither soggy or hard.  Baby shiitake mushrooms - These were SO delicious. They didn't have that aftertaste shiitake mushrooms have, nor that chewy texture.  I could literally eat a huge platter full of just these lil mushrooms.   Dessert:  OMG they gave us 4 ice cream scoops, each a different flavor:  Butter Pecan, Chocolate, Strawberry Sorbet, Kiwi Sorbet. All made from scratch.  French Vanilla Cheesecake: THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!!!! You HAVE to order this. It was straight melt-in-your-mouth, SO-damn -creamy, SO rich you'd think you wouldn't be able to swallow it, vanilla bean-y and yet, not so sweet like cheap bakeries make it that it hurts your throat. If you don't order this, you're missing out. My mouth's DROOLING from thinking about it! Seriously.  Fingerling Donut: rich, buttery, flaky pastry that has its own dipping sauce, which is incredibly tasty. It tasted like a donut, but denser, richer, and more buttery.  Fresh Fruit: sliced strawberries and pineapples. Even their fruit was the perfect amount of ripeness and sweetness!   You've got to eat here. I'm one picky, hard to please lil bitch..and if I thought it was scrumptious, then believe me. It must be MORE than scrumptious.",

All of the ladies were given a rose that evening.  :0)  There was plenty of room for the four of us, and we were served immediately by our two waiters, Kevin and Robert.    They were fantastic, really knew their stuff, and were even able to teach me a thing or two about beef!  And I have watched about 4,000 hours of foodtv.  We wrote a note to the management about how wonderful Kevin was, he really knew how to sell and treated us all to impeccable service.  We ordered their current special, the tasting menu, but as far as tasting menus go this was fantastic.  We didn't have to choose one item per course, it was served family style and we were able to sample everything off of the menu for $60 per person.  What a flippin' deal.  We had roasted red peppers, beet salad, a green salad, as well as quail to start.  The sides came out, yukon gold mashed potatoes that were almost liquidy they were so smooth, shitake mushrooms, and bacon brussell sprouts.  Then we had skirt steak, flatiron steak, diver sea scallops, and we ordered an additional pot of short ribs to share.  THESE WERE AMAZING. I would swim in the short ribs if I could... but I can't so I just had to settle with eating too much.  Dessert was also incredible, served with sides of home-made ice cream.  The liquid chocolate cake was by far my favorite... served with coffee ice cream.  WOW.  Get here any way you can and bring an empty stomach.  You are going to need it for those short ribs.",

    "text": "This place is good but pricey to go with.  The steak is AMAZING and is ridiculously tender; however, please note that Kobe beef is NOT available right now (not sure if prior reviews are aware).  The US is not importing any Japanese beef right now and has not been for several months due to health concerns after Fukishima.  What they have replaced Kobe beef with is the Australian A5 Wagyu beef.  I would recommend the chef's selection (two person minimum) of the Australian A5 if you're looking for amazing array of different cuts.  Though I never got to try their Kobe beef, three people from our group have dined at Craftsteak before and noted that the Kobe beef was noticeably better, so I'm a little disappointed there.  A lot of their appetizers are also worth commenting on.  First, the tartare is great and if you have only appetizer option, go with this.  The mix of mushrooms and the prosciutto also deserve a mention.  The service was exceptional.  The staff was very attentive and the sommelier was able to assist with selecting two bottles of wine.  However, one person at our table was a celiac and we ordered the proscuitto specifically for her, requesting the pretzel bread sticks to be excluded from our order.  Unfortunately, they were not, and we just had to make sure to give her only the pieces that were \"untouched\" by the bread.  Overall, worth a try if you're willing to spend a little extra on an amazing steak.",

I asked for it medium rare (that's the only way to eat a fine steak) and it was cooked to perfection!  If you're penny pinching don't come here, but if you're willing to pay a bit more I don't think you'll be disappointed!  The food and the service are both top drawer!    My mantra in life...

Wagyu skirt steak, potato puree, sweet corn, lobster bisque and monkey bread were the order tonight and as always everything was exceptional! Normally this is a 5 star restaurant for me, but tonight service was way off. One server for 5 tables and there was definitely a lack of attention to all tables. Also, the kitchen must have also been understaffed as food came out slow and in uneven time intervals. Normally it's 2 servers for 4-5 tables and that definitely helps. Overall, it is great here and in my opinion worth a splurge!",

We both weren't sure if they were going to be able to seat us since we made no reservations and really just came here on a limb.  But they accommodated us pretty quick, which was great since we had a show to go to afterwards.  My bf told me that Tom was a guy who was on Top Chef and that this restaurant was known for it's steak and he really wanted to try it.  I'm glad we did because it was by far the best food I've ever had.  I ordered the Wimbledon cocktail, and it was simply refreshing.  If you love gin like how I do, definitely give this drink a try.  I ordered the the Divers Sea Scallops that was served with spaghetti squash and WOW, the scallops were the best I've ever had.  They were cooked perfectly, melted into my mouth like butter. My gosh, what I would do to have some of it now! We also ordered a side of the Brussels sprouts and I am now a fan of them more than ever! Perfectly caramelized and cooked with bacon?! SOLD! I forgot what type of steak my boyfriend got but does it matter? I bet they're all good, I mean this place is known for their steak!  The service and our waitress were very accommodating and helpful.

You can definitely tell that the beer was aged in casks previously used to age single malt scotch. Good beer. I note that the Bar Alcohol menu had six pages of single malt scotch options!  Had what has to be one of the most expensive meals I've ever partaken in. Five of us had dinner here one night and we opted for one of the sampler meals - which included a number of appetizers and salads - including a Steak Tartar. The main course included a Flat Iron, Ribeye, Filet Mignon, and New York Strip steaks - cooked medium rare and pre-sliced, served in cast iron pans.  The Steak Tartar was excellent, as were the tasty salads. The steaks were really good! My favorite was the Ribeye, followed by the Filet Mignon. The Ribeye was buttery and melted in your mouth. The main course also included a pot of whipped potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, roasted Brussel sprouts, and Risotto.  For dessert, there was a range of plates brought out - my very favorite was the Monkeybread. Delicious!  I needed a Bellhop to come and wheel me out of there in a wheelbarrow when we were done. That really was to much food for me - most I've eaten in a long time.  Service was excellent! 4 Stars - simply because the place is soooo expensive!",

Just so so.   $22 hand cut waygu tartare crostini The texture was very soft and lacked something crispy or different to it.  They crack a raw egg into it and I think that gave it a slimey coating to the tartar. It has good flavor on its own but I wish that I hadn't ordered waygu in this tartare format.  It was difficult to tell if the meat was any good.  It didn't seem like but the egg and flavors covered it up pretty good. Good meat shouldn't be chopped up like this :(. The crostini is super salty but it was a nice size and good crunchy and fluffy texture.    $55 18 oz ribeye, dry aged angus, bone in, medium rare It was served medium well :( Flavoring was amazing! It had a nicely grilled flavor that was a bit smokey, sweet, and salty.  Great dimension and balance.  The downside... The meat was tough and at first I thought it was because I had a dull knife. It took a lot of effort to cut through the chewy meat. It had a lot of connective tissue.  I was really surprised and asked if this was indeed dry aged.  The outer part of the steak had great flavors but the inner part was flavorless and bland. Sort of like a 20 minute aged steak where it didn't have enough time to soak into the main parts. I so wanted this to be good but it wasn't :(  $15 baby spinach garlic oil Fantastic!!! One of the best spinach side dishes I've ever had at a steak house.  Fresh, perfectly cooked, and flavorful. I highly recommend this.  $15.00 Cinnamon Monkey Bread Cinnamon brioche pecan toffee sauce, banana ice cream Amazing!! The flavors had a nice punch to the palate and the ice cream was over the top! Don't leave here without trying this.  Decaf coffee Came in a French press. Very nice robust flavors for a decaf.  Excellent portion.  Service Attentive and friendly staff. Great service!  Overall Would not recommend the beef here.  Come here for coffee and dessert instead!",

The restaurant's sommelier recommended a few bottles of wine to pair with our food and it turned out to be perfect. There was never a point in our dining experience that we were in need of anything.   The ribeye was delicious and cooked perfectly for a medium-rare. I don't usually love bread but their rolls were amazing.  My only complaint are with the side dishes. We had the potato gratin, Brussels sprouts, and braised kale, all of which tasted too salty. On the plus side (no pun intended), the Brussels sprouts and the braised kale both had bacon mixed in and you can't go wrong with bacon.",

    "text": "Escorted by a beautiful hostess to my seat in a decidedly \"steakhouse\" atmosphere. Nothing too striking or amazing about the decor.   Started with bread served in a cast iron skillet. Very good bread resembling a Hawaiian roll.   I was hoping for a chef's selection or menu but they only have that for two or more (curses to traveling alone).  My waiter recommended the scallops for an appetizer. For my first bite I experienced amazingly buttery scallops with a seasoned buttery flavor. However, when I finished my first scallop (of three) I found myself shifting from amazement to indifference to slight disapproval of the (basil?) herb and lemon undertone. The more I ate the more flavors I c  To me, I felt that the scallops on their own were so amazing, a simple butter sauce would be perfect with a tiny squeeze of lemon. But that's just me...  I ordered the domestic Wagyu ribeye. It was a pretty bad steak. I read all the reviews of how amazing this place was so I came ready for a delicious experience and was quite disappointed. Uninspired was the word that came to mind.   The beef had a dual personality. One side was rough and chewy. Chewy. It was a perfectly cooked medium but one side had a somewhat decent texture but the other end was downright ... Chewy. I didn't even finish my steak it was that bad. And this wasn't bad \"for Wagyu\". It was bad for steak. I've had way better steaks at Outback for fractions of the $105 price tag.   For sides, I ordered spinach but was brought half corn and half spinach. Thanks GOODNESS for the corn!! The spinach was plain and boring. But once I had a bite of corn it almost made up for everything else. It was unbelievable!!!!! It reminded me of a gourmet BBQ. An assortment of flavors that WOWed me.   I spoke up and the manager brought me a domestic Wagyu filet mignon. I'm writing to here so I haven't gotten it yet.   The manager said he understood my taste on the steak is mine and valid. I appreciate how he tactfully said \"these are amazingly expensive steaks so I don't know WTF your taste buds are telling you\". Kudos to the politically savvy manager.   I can only really compare my experience to mine at Sage a few months ago. It was a completely different experience from start to finish. I felt like I was in a luxury restaurant. I think 50 people came by my table every 45 seconds. Here, I felt almost like I was on an island.   I guess I feel the same way about the MGM Grand Hotel that I do about craftsteak. It is nice but there are better, fancier, deliciouser places costing less.   I'm still waiting for my replacement steak. I really would rather just pay the full check, leave, and chalk it up to a bad experience I probably wouldn't repeat (even if this was an off night and I got that one bad steak).   As I sit here thinking, I think back to discussions I've had about what differentiates a professional from an amateur (other than money). A professional is consistent. Sure, amateurs may make a great play, take an amazing photo, or cook a great meal but it takes a professional to do it to a level of quality day in and day out. A bad day for a professional is still usually better than most amateurs. So even if this steak was an anomaly, a place of this caliber should not have too many nights that are this bad.   With all that said and done, I will give this place a 3 instead of a 2 because I'm hoping they are usually much better and one poor review shouldn't dissuade anyone from trying them out. Now, if they have a bad experience then they can rate them a 2...  OK I just finished my replacement filet. A finish able steak. Still don't feel it was worth the money but at least this was a good steak.  When I got the bill, I was disappointed that the manager did not discount anything. Not that I expected it, but traditionally management would comp an appetizer or offer free dessert or something.",

Being vegetarian you'd think I didn't like steak houses, but they tend to have great cocktails and yummy bread, and this one did.  My husband ordered the 22 oz T-bone and carrots. I had the heirloom tomato salad to start and the potatoes au gratin for my main (and of course the carrots). Everything was very good and the service was fantastic. I had a Hangar One martini with 2 blue cheese olives (I am still pissed that in Vegas they charge extra for the olives!), but it was very good. We ended up taking a lot back to the room with us and it was great for lunch today.  All that said, how could this restaurant get 5 stars from me? Easy! Follow the Ruth's Chris model and offer a vegetarian plate - duh! Simple. It is such as easy thing to do and I can't understand why they don't offer such a thing. And, would it be the end of the world if they offered one pasta that could be vegetarian? Anyway, I survived as I always do.  DOS 0803 2015",

We had several servers assisting at the table and they were all very well trained and personable. Very professional. The restaurant itself is beautiful and has a very classy look and feel. Dim and romantic. Children not really recommended. Recommendations are. Ordered: Filet mignons and one with a lobster tail NY Steak Snap peas with onions (sides are extra - they recommend one per person and it was a LOT of food for 3 people doing it this way. Unless of course you are feeding, say, 3 football player guys) Glazed heirloom carrots (honey glazed)( yummy) Potato Gratin The wine list was extensive and we each had a nice glass of white. All sides were amazing! Everyone loved their dishes and presentation of the meat in their pans was different and unexpected. You will pay the price for this food but if it is a special occasion or you have it in your budget, you will not be sorry you came, IMO.  There are so many steakhouses in Vegas but I would return here in a heartbeat. I will remember how perfectly tender my steak and lobster tail was for some time. It is easy to mess up either of these items but the chefs knew what they were doing and Tom C's high standards were definitely maintained on this night. Also loved the little complimentary sweet buns with the meal! We took my friend out here who is a local. She normally refuses to take home any leftovers but she insisted on taking everything on this occasion! It was that good.",

The filet portion of the steak was great but I wasn't a huge fan of the strip. The spinach had no flavor and was a huge disappointment.  The puree was good but by this time we had way too much food and really didn't need it.  If we were to return we'd do the wagyu, oysters, & just a filet.  Our bill was about $300.

Long story short.....we arrived at our show late. The drink refills came slow, food came out slow, and we waited for our ticket for what seemed like an eternity.

For $125 per person it was a lot of food and very reasonable; there was enough for four people!  Here's how I'm rating the place: Service: 5 stars...the entire wait staff tending to us was professional and knew the menu inside and out.  Food: 5 stars...steaks (filet and ribeye) were cooked to perfection.  You're served four salads: warm frisee, mozzarella with tomato, cucumber and shrimp cocktails.  Seriously the best mozzarella salad I've had so far and I devoured the frisee.  We had four desserts...the monkey bread was amazing.  I highly recommend it.  Cocktails: 5 stars...my husband is picky about his Manhattan cocktails.  They got it just right including the Orange twist, and the cucumber gin cocktail I ordered was great.  Atmosphere: love that it's casual dining...no need to dress up.  Overall I recommend this place.  Yes, this is Vegas and there are other steakhouses but if you're feeling overwhelmed by your dining choices consider this place.  Our bill came out to $300 before tip. $13 each for cocktails, $5 each for coffee.  BTW, they have wagyu on the menu as well.  I'm not made out of money but I thought the prices were cheap for this type of protein.  Less than $110 for 10 oz of American wagyu and $225 starting for 10 oz of Japanese wagyu.  We live in Silicon Valley and for good wagyu it's close to $200 for 3 oz.",

Because you either go big or go home when you wanna dine at Craft. The tasting menu is basically based on what the house chef wants to serve you that night. The only thing you really get to pick is your choice of cut of meat, other than that it is up to the chef to impress you.   We were served the awesome sea salt dinner rolls to start. I even asked for extra bread to take home because I knew we'd have left overs.  Appetizers: Cesar salad wedge leaves, proscuitto, beef tartar, and shrimp cocktail. I think I was full after the appetizers. They don't skimp on portion hear folks, and it was delicious.  Entree: I had the filet and my husband had the t-bone. Both were served in silver platter dishes. I was already looking forward to eating my leftovers the following day.  Sides: Brussel sprouts, risotto, and mashed potatoes. It was as if they read our minds and knew exactly what sides we wanted.  Dessert: OmG overboard here. Really I was in heaven. Monkey bread with banana ice cream, carrot cake with maple ice cream, mango chile sorbet, and fresh fruit. SoO Good! The mango chile sorbet was delicious! It reminded of those mexican candy lollipops I used to eat as a kid.  I can't wait for our next dinner here. Definitely a splurge you have to do in Vegas!",

Our waiter allowed us to pick what we wanted to eat. 2 salads (arugula and warm frisee), scallops, 2 steaks, asparagus, mushroom assortment, garlic mashed potatoes, and then 4 desserts. The wine selection is amazing and they will help you select one that suits your palate.   You will not be disappointed! And the monkey bread is literally the most amazing thing I've ever eaten.",

    "text": "A great meal overall, but fell short of five stars.  Started with the salted Hawaiian sweet bread with butter. Simple, yet absolutely delicious. Points for the perfect sized cast iron plate holding the bread in place.  Next, I had to try one of each of the oysters. I ordered one of each, - Pleasant Bay, Olympia, and Beau Soleil. The oyster from Pleasant Bay was the tiny, about the size of a poker chip. The next oyster from Olympia was small as well, but just sightly bigger than the one from Pleasant Bay. The oyster from Beau Soleil was also small, but it was the largest of the three. The first two oysters didn't taste good at all, and in fact, they were tasteless. The oyster from Beau Soleil had decent flavor and was the only one with any liquor.   Then came the risotto and the bone in, dry aged rib eye about 20 minutes later. The risotto had good texture and tasted fine, average at best.  The steaks are where Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak shines. The rib eye was cooked perfectly, medium just as I asked. The pan came out with a tasty grilled onion along with a sweet dark sauce that was just delicious.   Finally, I ordered a creme brulee with strawberries for dessert. It was good, but the ratio between egg and carmelized sugar was way off. There was too much sugar on top and not enough egg pudding. It was still tasty though.   Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak also shines when it comes to service. I planned on ordering a glass of rose, but ended up sticking with ice water. The gentleman frequented my table to ensure my glass was filled full and that everything was going well. The waitress was attentive and very receptive with any requests I had.   My recommendation is to stick with the steaks. You can't go wrong with the rib eye. They also have a fantastic alcohol selection whether you're looking for cocktails, wine, beer, or liquor.",

We ordered a variety of steaks, the cauliflower, asparagus, spinach, and potatoes. It was Ah-Mazing!! Also, we ordered a great bottle of red wine and enjoyed vodka cocktails that were enjoyed by all!!  We ended the night with desserts....bread pudding, red velvet ice cream, and the brownie!!

    "text": "I came here with my date and my parents, since my parents always complain about how we never buy them a nice steak dinner. Everything about this restaurant screamed elegance and class, since the decor is classic and everybody is dressed up.  The bread is usually the attention-grabber for nice steak houses, but theirs was basically just baked hawaiian bread with salt sprinkled on top. Not impressed.  Three of us got a steak and my mother had scallops. I didn't get to try her scallops but I tried all three steaks, the 18 oz rib-eye, the 16 oz NY strip, and the 10 oz filet. Nothing was memorable minus the rib-eye, which was good because it was fatty. The meat quality wasn't particularly reflective of the price and the flavor was almost a bit bland, even for me, who avoids salt at all costs.   Nonetheless, the spinach and potato puree sides saved the meal and were a great complement to the meat.  This place was nice, but it definitely isn't the best steakhouse in Vegas, I'm sure of it. I've had TASTIER (not necessarily better quality) filet at Wicked Spoon buffet (yes, I just said that).  For the record, my mother said her scallops were amazing and my dad, who doesn't usually like scallops, kept picking at it off her plate so that must be good!",

I had really high hopes, considering it is Tom Colicchio's restaurant. I had the hanger steak and it was mediocre. I've had hanger steaks at several different restaurants in the past and this was by far the worst. We ordered mushrooms to share at the table and they were flavorless. Typically mushrooms are cooked in wine, or sauteed in butter, but these were hard, very woody and were not transformed at all. For the price they charge at this restaurant I expect a lot better.    With the above said, service was very good and some of the appetizers we ordered were really good. The arugula salad was excellent, the pureed potatoes were very good and the prosciutto was fantastic. However, considering this is a steakhouse and we were all underwhelmed with our steaks, I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.",

Got the $55 ribeye that came luke warm and under seasoned.  By far the worst ribeye I've ever had at a nice steakhouse.  It was full of fat too.  The risotto was horrible.  Sour like something we bad and it came with huge cherry tomatoes, very unrefined.  Short rib was delicious, highly recommended.  Scallops were just whatever and the carpaccio was good, savory and worth trying.  Service was excellent minus out main server.  He didn't do much but the other help was amazing.  Monkey bread was recommended so we tried it.  Very very very sweet, too sweet.  I y thing that was good was the banana ice cream but I wouldn't get this of you for like your deserts too sweet.  Overall, it was a bad steakhouse.  Skip it",

    "text": "We're baaaaaack. A year ago, we indulged in some high-end steak-chomping debauchery. After that night, I hadn't seen that many digits on a credit card bill since my wife last disappeared on Black Friday. So this time around, we were a little more prudent with our spending. We decided to go with the fall tasting menu at a \"mere\" $85 per person.  You know how at these restaurants, the waiter usually has some long-winded, rehearsed spiel about the quality of their ingredients, the specials, or some type of small-talk? Not with us. We order, send the waiters along the way, and telepathically beam some last thoughts to their brain -- we're hungry, so bring our food fast.  Down to the food. Here's what came with the seasonal menu:  Salad of roasted beets, picked egg Warm goat cheese, red cabbage Diver sea scallops Prime beef flat iron Roasted filet mignon Roasted brussel sprouts, smoked bacon Butternut squash Sauteed shiitake mushroom Cinnamon monkey bread Ice cream and sorbet  For some reason, I was initially worried that this wasn't going to be enough food, that they might bring out munchkin-sized, dainty portions. I was already planning on second dinner. But they proved me wrong. The portions were just right, if not more than expected. In the end, I was stuffed silly. My wife and I demolished everything, leaving nothing behind. I had to un-notch my belt buckle and let it all hang out.  Memorables include the diver sea scallops, which were silky and just melted like butter. I'm not a big goat cheese fan, but the way they prepared this dish was excellent. Both meats obviously are not of the creme de la creme wagyu quality, but served its purpose in providing very tasty and flavorful protein. The sides of the squash and mushroom were good, but they were cut in such tiny cubes that it was a bit tough to scoop out in spoonfuls.  The top everything off with a decadent dessert like the monkey bread is just absolutely ridiculous. Oozing with sugar icing, cinnamon, and more sugar, this dessert is essentially sticky buns on steroids. As if we didn't get enough carbs, we even took a doggie bag of their complimentary dinner rolls to snack on later. As always, service was top-notch. Special compliments go out our waiter, Marcus Samuelsson's doppelganger.",

The atmosphere is nice, cozy and dark- very masculine decor. It was lovely. Service was excellent and friendly.  I ordered a Pom Rita on the rocks and it was so delicious I had to order another one!   They brought warm, delicious yeast rolls to the table while we waited.   We ordered the tomato bisque with goat cheese and the Bibb salad with bacon and blue cheese. He loved the soup and the salad was fantastic. The bacon lardons were so good our little one kept stealing them from my salad! The salad was dressed with a blue cheese dressing, and was a generous-sized salad.   For the mains, he and I ordered the filets, medium rare. He got the corn side and I ordered the grits. The little one got the flat-iron stake, medium rare with the potato puree.   The food was incredible. Steaks had a great, unique flavor and the sides were delicious. Grits perfectly cooked and the corn was a nice surprise   The real standout was our little one's flat-iron steak. We ordered that because it's smaller (no kids' menu as you might imagine). The flavor was incredible. Perfectly medium rare and flavorful. The potato puree was also good, but he polished off the steak!   We didn't order dessert, nothing on there we had to have, but it all looked good.   Definitely have respect for the judging he dishes out on Top Chef!",

    "text": "For what you are paying you need to be wowed.  I was not wowed.  Now, I do get to eat out quite often and as such am picky, but if I am paying 56 for a steak (cheapest filet) and potentially even 115-260 for a steak it needs to be something I couldn't cook at home.  The steak prep was uninspiring, the sides were ho hum, I had the corn grits and they were just wrong.  I live in the south, eat grits all the time, for breakfast for dinner, creamy, cheesy or stone ground, etc... and these were just not worth the calories (though the bacon on top was good :)).  The Parker house yeast rolls served before were fine, I have had this twice now on the west coast (la the time before) and I think it is a \"new\" thing - supposed yeast Parker house rolls with salt on top, but they aren't the right style of roll - yeast rolls need to melt in your mouth, these do not, more boring basic white bread roll.  A southerner needs to teach both places how to make yeast rolls! The service is also one of those \"sit and savor\", it was late and my first night there, I didn't want to sit or savor :) the staff was friendly enough, but again I wasn't wowed for what was easily a $2000 bill for our group. So, if you don't get to go out to nice places often this is probably a great upscale very nice meal, but honestly the food does not warrant the prices they want you to pay.",

I have a lot of tolerance. 2 stars is because it was below Applebees in quality, service, price and ambiance.  If you've been to Craft you will notice that there are 3 tables that are situated in the hallway of the casino. Our party got that table and the restaurant gave us a round of drinks because we wanted to move. This tells me that the situation happens so often with disappointment in these tables, that the policy is free drinks automatically. So our ambiance was half hallway in front of the bathrooms.  We didn't cheap out. We got a mix of steaks from the high end black label wagyu to the $50 steaks on the menu. We also got 4 side dishes. The Kale was way too salty. We barely touched the side dishes. The ladies in our group got the Filet Mignon, men got Ribeye and Black label Wagyu. The ribeye wasn't any better than store bought and home grilled. The Wagyu was good. The Filet Mignon was intolerable! Bland, needing salt, dry, and tasting like ground beef.  Tom Colicchio should be ashamed. We were drilling the waitstaff on Tom Colicchio's visits to the restaurant and we found out he had only been there one time in the last year because a chef was promoted. That is pretty much what I figured.  The worst places are often the celebrity chefs. They are too busy being on TV to manage the food experience they are selling. To round it off, our service was below average. Drinks were slow to be replaced and our waitress was kind of a drag to be around. No good.",

The side items are incredible too.   My husband and I did make the mistake the first time of ordered 3 side items- boy was that a mistake! The sides are family style and large enough for 4+ people! We've learned how to handle the menu now, as well as aggressive waiters!   Something other than steak to really highlight is their Tomato and Mozzarella Caprese Salad- they serve this common appetizer with toasted hazelnuts which make their version about as good as it gets!",

    "text": "It was my birthday, and I wanted a tasty steak. I knew this ahead of time (that is, before my birthday), so I researched Vegas steakhouses, and was very intrigued by the menu at Craftsteak (particularly the side dishes), so I made a reservation for my boyfriend and me.   We showed up at the scheduled time and were promptly seated at a spot between the door and the bar, which means it was kind of noisy. No big deal, though. The seating was quite comfortable, very living room-esque. I was okay with that.   Because we have the unfortunate curse of being red wine haters, we started with champagne (err...sparkling wine) from Italy. It was some of the best I've had. In fact, I'd like more now.  While munching on the tasty garlic bread, we decided on what to order. I got the roasted pepper salad, Alan got the beet salad, and we decided to share a ribeye and kale.   I know that a steakhouse should be primarily known for its steak, but I was entirely too impressed with the salads we got, especially my roasted peppers. I mean, I love me some roasted peppers in any context, but it tasted like they put crack in these or something. I wanted two or three more plates of them, but then I wouldn't have room for my steak. The beets were also fresh and tasty, and I got to try a pickled egg for the first time. (It came with the beets, and I approved.)   Now, that ribeye. They said it was 16 ounces but it had to be more than that. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, just beautiful. The only thing was that my steak knife seemed pretty dull, so I had more difficulty than I'd expect cutting through the beef. That obviously didn't affect the taste, though. The kale had been braised with bacon and navy beans and had a great savory and bitter (but not too bitter!) flavor.   We were so packed by the end of the meal that we couldn't finish all of the kale. However, it was my birthday, so I wanted to get dessert anyway. I knew that one of the big desserts was out of the question, so I got some of the chocolate malt ice cream, which was absolutely splendid. Most ice cream seemed to pale in comparison.  Service was slightly slow at the beginning but was perfect after the courses started arriving. Overall, this was a lovely day to spend my birthday evening.",

    "text": "Went here with a group of 9 on a Sunday night, after making reservations only about two hours before. Got seated just fine, and the restaurant was not at all crowded. They were also kind enough to split our checks at the end.   We had multiple waiters constantly refilling drinks and attending to our needs. The main guy, in telling us about Craftsteak, boasted that they had been \"doing this a long time\" and had \"gotten pretty good at it.\" Initially, I thought it was a little boastful, but boy was he right.  A few things you might not be able to pick up from the menu online. You do not have to get the chef's tasting menu. You can order a la carte. The prices for entrees range anywhere from about $40 to in upwards of $100. You don't get any sides with your entree automatically, but the a la carte sides you can order (asparagus, pureed potatoes, roasted potatoes, etc) are huge and served family style. One side could be split among two, even three, people.   They start you off, for free, with fresh-out-of-the-oven dinner rolls, lightly covered in butter. They were very good -- not great, like Pearl Dive's bread in D.C. -- but very good.   I also ordered the lobster bisque to start. It was amazing. They put a good chunk of lobster in the bottom of a bowl, then pour the piping hot soup on top of it in front of you. I can't convey how good this was.  For dinner, I got the ribeye. I'm not a big steak guy, so maybe I don't have a good basis for comparison, but this was hands down the best steak I have ever had. The second place finisher isn't even close. I also tried a friend's short ribs, which I had seen as being well reviewed. They, too, were amazing.  For dessert, I had to try the famous monkey bread. Full though I was from the meal, I'm glad I did. Served with a sour cream ice cream, it was just incredible. Probably one of the top five desserts I've ever had (finishes behind the donuts at Graffiato and the pecan pie at Pearl Dive, though).   My girlfriend, a vegetarian, just got the tomato soup and ordered roasted potatoes on the side. I have to admit she was disappointed, and trying her soup, I can see why.  It was pretty bland, nothing like the lobster bisque.   That said, I can't not give this place 5 stars. Between my meal and hers, and two glasses of scotch, my total bill, with tax and tip, came out to about $200. You certainly don't have to spend that much if you don't get dessert and soup, but you can easily. That said, it was way worth it. If I go to Vegas again, I'm likely going back here.",

You cant go wrong with anything you select here. Every dish tasted amazing and well prepared.

    "text": "MGM Grand has a sign out front that says \"The City of Entertainment\". MGM Grand is more like \"The City of Restaurants\". There are so many good choices in this resort that it is very hard to choose which upscale place you'd like to dine. Well, look no further.   Craftsteak is easily accessible if you come from the Valet or the parking garage. If you walked in the front door of the MGM Grand by the strip, you have a long hike to get here.   The food is excellent, the portion sizes are great and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.   My previous three journeys into the Craftsteak, I ordered the 16oz Skirt Steak. Not the Wagyu version, the base version. Pretty much, if you were ordering cars at a steak house......you'd have your choice between the BMW 3-Series or the Toyota Camry. I always picked the Toyota. Why? Well, the skirt steak that they served at $36/16oz was sufficient and delicious.   Unfortunately, it seems based on their menus online that they only have the Wagyu kobe skirt steak now at a hefty $69/12oz. If you want a BMW 3-Series steak, knock yourself out.   The truffled mac and cheese and the other sides here are excellent, but unnecessary.  You only need the steak here because if you order lots of sides, you'll be wasting lots of food.  All in all the decor is nice, and the service is excellent which makes Craftsteak a perfect place for a quiet dinner.  I'll recommend this place to everybody I meet who stays at MGM Grand, however, I'll go across the street to Stripsteak @ Mandalay Bay for my favorite cut of skirt steak.",

In fact, we often venture out to try new restaurants and find ourselves longing for Craftsteaks food, service and ambiance.

We ALWAYS get the yukon gold mashed potatos and the maui onions which are never less than amazing. We have had the caesar salad before which is very good as well. The rolls that they bring are addicting!   The service is always top-notch, friendly, speedy, and classy without being stuffy. We absolutly LOVE this place!

    "text": "I'm a HUGE top chef fan and my expectations were very high. I thought some things were done very well such as the steak, but I was not a fan of other dishes. I'd give it 3.5-4 stars.  Started to the meal with beet salad appetizer. The beets were beautiful but didn't quite have enough taste... it needed more salt or something. But I did appreciate the natural sweetness of the beets and the 3 different types of beets on my plate.  My sister ordered the short ribs and honestly it was WAY too salty. Like almost inedible. Tried to pair it with some sides but it was just still too much.  I ordered the surf and turf, 6 oz. filet mignon with half a Maine lobster. The steak is excellent. It's tender and flavored well with that nice meaty taste. The lobster was cooked well and not overcooked but had a very slight fishy taste. Portions are generous (prices are expensive too but the cuts of meat are thick).  We also ordered 2 sides: the snap peas with horseradish and the hen of wood mushrooms. The snap peas were delicious with lots of butter but you couldn't taste the horseradish shavings. The hen of wood mushrooms were amazing! They had a nice earthy taste and the top of the mushroom was slightly crispy but the root was chewy. It had so much flavor and really wowed me.  Dessert we tried the mini apple donuts and the ice cream/sorbet platters. The mini apple fritters had a nice crispy outside but the inside was too doughy. The consistency was slightly off. Also, I wanted them to be really hot and freshly fried but they were warm and not hot enough to my liking. Ice cream/sorbets were solid and I enjoyed the lemon, kiwi, and hazelnut best.  The decor was great and warm feeling. The restaurant is big and definitely packed. We had 2 waiters and I found that kind of awkward... they would switch back and forth. Overall, I had a positive experience and I'm glad that I tried it. I wouldn't necessarily go back again but I'm very interested in trying Tom Colichio's restaurant in New York.",

I have no complaints about the food, but when you've eaten at high-end steakhouses for many years, the bar gets raised and you look for something to set a restaurant apart, and I didn't find that at Craftsteak.  Again, you won't be disappointed with the food, but if you're in Vegas for the weekend why not go somewhere more fun?",

What further solidifies Craftsteak as a 5 star steakhouse for me is what happened during our experience.  Marvin, our waiter and the wine steward was fantastic.  He helped us pick out some very nice cabernet Sauvignon.  When we told him we weren't sure what we wanted, he brought a few bottles and poured us \"healthy\" tastings.  He was knowledgable and friendly, and found us a perfect pairing.  We had asked that some of our unfinished delicious be wrapped as they cleared our plates.  At the end of our meal, another server came to our table and told us the following:  \"There was  a mixup and your to-go food was thrown out, so the chef prepared everything you had fresh.\"  We were given brand new food neatly prepared and packaged, they handled the situation perfectly.  CraftSteak continues to be one of the best restaurants in town.",

    "text": "after spending hours reading all the reviews on Yelp of all the different steak restaurants in Vegas, we decided on CRAFTSTEAK for our 10 year anniversary dinner.  i want to rate this restaurant 3/5 stars because of the issue with my husbands $106.00 steak, but the service we received from the restaurant manager, Jim, made up for it and earned an extra star.     SERVICE: let me start off by saying the service here is EXCELLENT. end of story.  AMBIENCE: not too loud, not too bright, spacious, plenty of room on the table for all the food you're going to order.  WINE:  this restaurant's wine list is PRICEY!  the least expensive bottle of red cab is $118.00.  we opted for a half bottle of Peju from Napa Valley for $55.00 and it was excellent.  normally we'd have ordered a full bottle to celebrate our anniversary but we were poolside all day and had already consumed a lot of alcohol so we didn't want to drink too much more.  FOOD: the complimentary mini pan of BREAD is AWESOME!.  it's served in a very hot cast iron baking tray and it stays warm the entire time.  the butter they serve with it is not rock hard so it's easy to spread on the soft warm bread.  this bread is \"melt in your mouth bread\"....mmmmm.   starters: LOBSTER BISQUE and TOMATO SOUP were outstanding, so much flavor although they could have been served a bit hotter in temperature.  I had planned on ordering the Butternut Squash soup but it was not on the menu last night.   mains: SALMON and Domestic Wagyu 14oz RIBEYE.  my salmon was excellent and cooked perfectly.  our server told me it's normally cooked med-rare and asked how i'd like it cooked so i said medium.  my husbands $106.00 ribeye is a different story :(  although it's served in a cast iron skillet and was cooked perfectly (med-rare), his steak was room temperature.  not warm enough to even eat.  he sent it back.  our server apologized and said she'd take care of it and would let her manager know.  in less than 5 minutes she returned back to our table with the \"warmed up\" $106.00 steak.  my husband said it was warmer but i could tell he was just \"settling\".  the manager Jim came over to our table and asked my husband how his steak was so he told him the truth, that he was not happy with his steak.  Jim was sympathetic and offered us free desserts/coffees/cappuccino's and said he'd adjust the price of the steak on our bill.  we were happy with that.   sides: POTATO PUREE and CORN.  if you love garlic, tell the server to add the cloves of roasted garlic on top of the potatoes.  these potatoes are SINFUL.  the best potatoes we ever tasted.  i don't know what kind of corn we had, it was roasted in brown butter (it's not shown on the online menu).  it was very good as well.  dessert: compliments of the manager, we chose the monkey bread on his recommendation.  we were so full at this point that we could not really enjoy it.  had only a few bites. it was very fresh, warm, DELICIOUS!  topped w/nuts and served with a side of ice cream.  CONCLUSION: we would definitely go back.  our bill for the ribeye was adjusted to 50% off.",

We asked for the lobster bisque after reading reviews on yelp and they added that in as well and WOW was that yummy!  We asked for a chocolate dessert as well and they added that too.  Needless to say, we could not finish everything and the service was excellent.  Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Craftsteak, and it definitely delivered. Fantastic food in a classy yet unpretentious environment, and amazing service.   Some notes:  -We ordered the cheaper steaks on the menu, and they were AMAZING. Melt in your mouth. Hard to imagine how good the Waygu and other pricey ones would be. But don't feel like you'll be shortchanged by ordering the cheaper ones.  -Don't skip salads. The fava bean salad was the best thing I ate. Who knew a salad could be so good.  -Sit at the bar before dinner if you have time. Our reservation was running a bit late, so we had a drink. The bartenders make the most delicious, strong drinks.   If you love steak and want a classy dinner in Vegas, go here! You won't be disappointed.",

I bet they do some client \"profiling.\"  My guest and I were probably not young, hip or sexy enough to be seen there.  Oh well, Nobu, L'atelier and Fiamma accommodated us just fine.  Nobu...now there's a great restaurant...But if you are into that \"mean-girl\" attitude and want to be treated like an outcast with all your money, Craftsteak might suit you just right.  Can't comment on the food because we never got in.  If the food is anything like the service they offered at the front, it must bittersweet (bitter because we never got in, sweet because we saved all that money we would have spent).",

    "text": "So, get this, my friend and fellow Yelper Jen F., is a vegan, but one of the only things I HAD to do while in Vegas visiting Jen F. was eat at Craftsteak.  Vegan = Craftsteak = FALSE.  OR SO I THOUGHT!  Before making reservations we called and asked Craftsteak if they could accommodate a vegan, and with a resounding, \"yes,\" reservations were booked.  And then we found ourselves at Craftsteak, ordering drinks and perusing the menu...  For me: Surf and Turf with the fillet and prawns and the Yukon gold potato puree. Monkey bread for dessert.  For Mike C: The porterhouse and the Brussels sprouts sauteed with bacon. Cheesecake for dessert.  For the vegan: An absolutely gorgeous vegan platter that included Jerusalem Artichokes, asparagus, mushrooms, broccolini and so many other things that Vegas' Yardaritas have erased from my memory.... Chocolate sorbet for dessert.  The steaks were expertly cooked, exactly as a steak house should cook a steak. The sides were delicious, exactly as a 5-star restaurant should cook sides. The dessert was decadent and over indulgent, exactly as a restaurant in Vegas should make dessert.   Craftsteak pleased the meat lovers in our group in every possible way.  However, the real show stopper at the table was hands down the vegan platter that this steak house put together. I mean, my god. These vegetables were cooked so well that I, a carnivore through and through, could have had myself a vegan feast and been satisfied.  The other show stopper was definitely the service; Tom Colicchio's people know how to treat you well, that's for sure.  Eating a Craftsteak was definitely one of the highlights of Vegas for me! However, I have to admit, had Tom come over to my table and let me sit on his face, I would have enjoyed the experience SO MUCH MORE!",

    "text": "4.5 stars.  I've been putting off this review because I really want to do my honey, Tom C., justice.  I probably won't, but I hope that won't hurt my chances with him anyway.  I need to keep relations good since he's at the top of my Ross-and-Rachel-esque Top 5 Celebrities You Can Cheat With list.  Yes, he's my Dorothy Hamill.   We dined here as a party of 10 on a 10:00 pm reservation, and the experience was wholly pleasant and pleasurable.  The staff was consummately gracious and professional throughout the entire meal.  I've eaten places where we've arrived shortly before closing like this, and the servers could not have been -- or overtly acted -- more put-out.  Not the case at all at Craftsteak.  In fact, no one batted an eye, and our server David treated us like we were his only table and like he was beyond pleased to attend to our every little need.  When we left the restaurant (the absolute last party to depart), all the staff thanked us for coming and bid us good-night.  And they actually seemed genuine.  Our dinner was pretty darn phenomenal.  Most of the top-of-the-line ingredients come from local or small farms (even spotted some oysters from Virginny!).  Three of the diners raved it was the best meal they'd ever had anywhere.  I didn't feel *quite* that way, but it definitely approached dining Nirvana.  I was just really excited to be able to partake in Colicchio's famously prepared steak: there was a farm-raised grass-finished bison striploin on the menu that I jumped on as a newfound \"ethical flexitarian\" (I can hear you guys groaning, you know).  It was 42 bucks.  By itself.  The entire menu is a la carte, in True upscale steakhouse fashion.  Was it worth 42 bones?  Probably not.  Was it fabulous?  Absolutely: cooked exactly to my specifications, tender and juicy, robust with flavor, seasoned perfectly, and seared to a beautiful crust on the outside.  We started with some salads: warm frisee with a soft poached egg and lardons of chewy bacon, and peppery arugula with toasted pine-nuts.  I really dislike eggs in most of their forms, but when this farm-fresh egg split and oozed over the frisee, something special happened...and I had a bite.  For their mains others sampled beef filet and ribeye, surf and turf with lobster, and the chilled seafood plate.  Everyone swooned.  The table shared roasted asparagus with lemon (fine, but uninspiring); roasted corn with herbs and scallions (this tasted, I kid you not, *exactly* like SunChips -- fine-dining, blow-your-mind SunChips); mushroom risotto (creamy, decadent, punctuated by sweet, fresh peas and topped with crisp chanterelles); and fried squash blossoms (way too rich and oily for most everyone's taste).  When David discovered we were in Vegas to celebrate husband's big three-oh, small plates of dessert samplers appeared at the table gratis.  Husband's had birthday wishes written in chocolate across the plate and a solitary candle.  Little details like this (and the posh, sophisticated interior decor) make Craftsteak an overall fabulous dining experience.  We ended up with a $1300 bill (tip included for party our size, tho) -- not that bad considering all we ate and drank, but to see a $1300 bill is so striking in its absurdity that someone actually snapped a pic of it and instantly uploaded it to Facebook...where it was met with all kinds of incredulity.  So no, it's not the kind of place you'd eat at on the regular (my honey has a $200+ Wagyu steak on his menu!).  But yes, it *is* the kind of place you really want to treat yourself to once in your lifetime.  The only reason I don't give it 5 enthusiastic stars is because I don't *quite* think the pricetag is justifiable.  [Top Chef: Tom Colicchio]",

I normally start my dinner with their Lobster Bisque, which I love more than most people. Second up would be the Fois Gras, normally a special and sometimes on the menu - paired with some type of fruit compote and deliciously creamy. Third, always my A5 Filet with Yukon Gold Puree and/or Wild Mushroom Risotto. I finish up with Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and coffee.  My husband, well, he is all over the place and orders something different almost every time. I will say, he has NEVER been disappointed.   We almost always get a bottle of wine, or bring our own if it is a special blend or occasion, to have with our meal.   Now, for all of this amazing food, it is extremely pricey.  Our meals never total less than $600 for just the two of us. I assure you, if you plan on splurging in Vegas and want a solid and hearty meal - you go here. Period.  I love it and I totally plan on coming back again and again and again. Hope to see some of you there!",

I ordered the ribeye but was persuaded by the server to try the skirt steak. I know, I thought the same thing, tough and chewy! My wife got the filet. The skirt steak was BETTER than the filet. I couuld cut it with my fork! The filet was the chewy one. Both were cooked medium rare. The manager did remove a portion of our bill because of it. Our service, which was performed by Eddy, Eddy and Stacey, was SUPERB! I would have given 5 stars except for the filet which is supposed to be the 'best' cut of meat. We will be back!!",

    "text": "Vegas 5 Days 3 Nights at steakhouses and unfortunately they were all this trip from OK to downright awful.  Our last night was going to see a show at the MGM and we decided for simplicity sake to eat there at one of their many restaurants.  Craftsteak was the selection.   5 of us arrive and its a handsomely appointed modern vibe type steakhouse that certainly has the ambiance downpat. We had requested a table not a both and there are no tables available in the main dining room so they stick us in an ANNEX room that appeared to be part of the private dining area. Just us 5 here took away from the incredible ambiance of the place. MAJOR STRIKE 1.  Wine list presented and 150% to 200% mark up on the wine but the sommelier was very good and we ended up with a not over the top price wise cambernet that was excellent.  Hot Buns more like whitel castle hamburger buns were served as we perused the menu that aparently changes daily.  Heavy meat selections almost no fish  with very high price points particularly to the point only 2 of their cuts were prime meat so you are talking overkill for a step down in grade.   A Beets Salad to start was fresh and tasty but really had nothing to offer that made itspecial $15.00  Roasted red peppers with garlic chips.. Not quite sure what that ment but they were out of jar red peppers with no taste and some sliced garlic and olive oil $15.00 (FAIL)  2 Shrimp Cocktails 5 to order 12 to a pound size shrimp $24.00 each... Umm HELLO over priced so I could not get past the price points for the ok Shrimp.   1 Ceasar Salad $15.00 Nothing Special at all   Dinner: 2 bone in Prime Rib Eyes were OK and their steak knives were awful ... Their 3 Bone IN NY STRIPS were also OK but with prices points of 69.00 each they are Completely out of their Minds.  All and all Price was Steaks Fail.  Sides were Asparagus dry and tasteless French Fries Good Rissoto excellent and baby shitake mushrooms sauteed tasteless  ...5 Coffees hot and fresh...  So 5 Persons 2 bottles of wine with the above order and with tip $1025.00 Sorry folks I don't mind paying for top shelf but from the seating to the really fail food I can't go over two stars here.

Their menu changes daily, which is always impressive. We started with cocktails, and then my husband got wine. We ordered mozzarella with hazelnuts, and the heirloom tomatoes with olive oil. These were two separate dishes that my husband and I combined. We caprese'd. I ordered the domestic wagyu flatiron, and husband ordered a grilled ribeye. Both were amazing. The steaks aren't accompanied by anything, so we also got a side of crispy sunchokes and creamed pea tendrils. The pea tendrils were good, but the sunchokes were REALLY good.  Food, drinks, and service were all great. So yeah, it's a steakhouse, but not your standard steakhouse.",

    "text": "Our group of 8 arrived for our 8:30 reservation and were seated promptly. We all decided to do the domestic wagyu tasting menu ($145/person). Our total bill came to be about $1,500 after tax & tip w/ wine and other drinks included. IT WAS SO TOTALLY WORTH IT! To be honest, my expectations weren't too high for Crafsteak, but I left mindblown (my stomach was goin to explode too LOL). We basically had a feast fit for way more than 8 people. Service and food were excellent!! Overall it was3 courses and for each course, the servers came out with the dishes in symphony.  They start you off w/ their addicting bread which I regret eating so much of because it filled up my stomach space. The bread comes out hot & fresh in a rectangle cast iron skillet. The butter is sooo good w/ the bread. It's some sort of hawaiian roll w/ sea salt sprinkled on top. So buttery, rich, fluffy, and flavorful w/ a hint of sweetness. We got 2 rounds of bread cause it was so good  First Course: Salads & apps Caesar Salad - Unique twist to a classic salad. The romaine lettuces were left full in leaf form rather than cut. The dressing wasn't heavy and the minced anchovies weren't overpowering. Baby Bibb - the buttermilk blue cheese & bacon complemented the salad very well. Normally I don't like blue cheese, but the way it was incorporated in this dish made it light and tasty. Avocado Salad - Light lemon vinaigrette dressing and PLENTY of avocado fans. The avocados were all ripe and smooth as a baby's butt.  Hand cut Wagyu tartare- I LOVE TARTARE and I totally could have eaten this w/out the crostini. There's also a small raw quail yolk right in the middle of the tartare. I liked eating this app w/ the bread they provided in the beginning Proscuitto San Daniele - KILL ME. The best proscuitto I've had. Not overly salty and it was delicious w/ the pears. It tasted even better wrapped around the cheese garlic breadsticks provided Shrimp cocktail - fresh plump shrimp, but it was like any other shrimp cocktail  Proscuitto Risotto - OMFG the risotto is THE BEST I've ever had. OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING. It contained english peas and scallions mixed in. The risotto had that creamy rich texture that just melts in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating this, had to force myself to stop so that I could share it w/ the rest of the table.  Potato Puree - Yukon GOLD POTATOES!! It was really creamy/smooth. I actually prefer this over Joel Robuchon's mashed potatoes.  For the vegetables we had asparagus, baby carrots w/ honey, snap peas w/ romesco & shallots, Mushroom assortment, Zucchini w/ maui onions. All of the vegetables were cooked perfectly. My fav were the assorted mushrooms (it included all the mushrooms like shiitake, french horn, etc) & baby carrots. The only bad dish of the night were the french fries. They weren't crispy enough  2nd Course: MEATS We basically had a whole cow on the table. Overall 8 cast iron dishes of diff cuts were laid out at the table. Half cooked medium rare and half medium. Each one had a nice beautiful red warm center w/ the perfect outside sear  NY strip - normally I don't like NY strip 'cause it's too lean and dry, but the NY strip cut here was my 2nd fav of the meat dishes! It looked lean, but was really juicy and soft yet flavorful Outside skirt - #1 fav for the table. This was the only plate that was gone at the end of the night. It was so melt in your mouth delicious! Tender and savory, best outside skirt I've had Ribeye - lots of fat, but was a bit more chewy than the other cuts Filet Mignon - Not as tender as most filet mignons I've had, was my 4th fav dish. Flat Iron - my 3rd fav dish! Came in a huge plate and we killed half of it. It was similar in taste to the outside skirt, but not quite as tender/soft Porterhouse - 4th fav dish of the night! Oh man for a dry aged steak, it was delish. My friend has had their porterhouse at Crafsteak in NY and said it tasted just as good as the NY location.  3rd course: Desserts Ice cream - Banana, Pistachio, white chocolate, and mixed berry swirl, and raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was a bit sour, I enjoyed the ice creams more especially pistachio Cinnamon Monkey bread - I was so excited to try this since everyone kept talking about it. For some reason it didn't get topped w/ vanilla ice cream, but it was still good. The pecan toffee sauce made it addicting. This tastes basically like a cinnamon roll, but not as sweet Chocolate Indulgence - Chocolate cake w/ caramel on the bottom. It was just ok Caramel Cheesecake - Light & airy, but I prefer Capital Grille's cheesecake. Apple caramel tart - Was basically like an apple pie tart. It wasn't overly sweet and the crust just lightly crumbles in your mouth. Loved it Farmers Market Fruit - Everyone's favorite! Came w/ an assortment of fresh fruits. Our fav were the kumquat, starfruit, passionfruit, tangerine, and strawberry. Each were sweet and ripe  I'll be back to try the surf & turf tasting menu!",

    "text": "Attended the restaurant w/friends who LOVE this place & we had a party of 7. Service was good, ambiance great, food (main courses) not so good.   We started w/arugula salads & lobster bisque. The salad was simple & delicious; the bisque was good, but not the best I've ever had.   The real let down were the entrees & sides. I had the surf & turf (filet & scallops) I appreciate a simple preparation for a steak, but mine really lacked flavor. A sprinkling of salt would've gone a VERY long way. Also, everything was cold. Not ice cold, but room temp & quickly cooler. I understand letting meats rest, but it was a bit much. We also shared sides (risotto, potato puree & gratin, grits, snap peas & asparagus) that were all barely warm. It just didn't make sense; we had a decent sized party, but it wasn't THAT big.   A manager did come around to check on the table, but we were still passing around sides & most of us hadn't tasted the main course (or compared notes), yet. Everyone was disappointed w/the temperature of the food, but no one wanted anything sent back. The sides were blah, very underwhelming. The short ribs were AMAZING & the snap peas were a big hit at the table (although I didn't personally care for them).   I have no interest in ever returning & was overall disappointed. When the most memorable part of your meal at a steakhouse is arugula, things aren't going well. We skipped dessert.",

Plus it came highly recommended from a few co-workers so we decided to try it. We had 6 pm reservations. When we checked in, we were immediately seated. The ambiance was elegant and quiet, perfect for a fancy dinner. We decided we weren't going to stuff our faces too much so we skipped the appetizers. I ordered the surf & turf with scallops and an 8 oz filet mignon. The steak was perfectly cooked and so tender but still retains its \"beefiness.\" The scallops were exceptional. Not over cooked and served with a lemon butter sauce. My friend and I split a side of risotto. I still dream of that risotto. Very rich and heavy with peas and prosciutto. Part of me wanted to stop eating my streak and just eat the risotto.   Service here was excellent as you would expect from Mr. Colicchio. And the other thing worth raving about is the bread! Salty, sweet, bread. This restaurant far exceeded my expectations.",

    "text": "After scoping Yelp, we decided this would be our \"fancy\" Vegas dinner.  While we dressed up, other people were just wearing T-shirts.  Par for the course in this city.  The place is big, warmly decorated and dimly lit.  Once you pass a bar with televisions, you enter the main dining room.  Our server was great.  An older, friendly, talkative guy.  He told us the menu changes every day, depending on what produce their supplier buys that morning in California.  You start with complimentary hot buttered, salted rolls in a skillet.  These were outstanding.  I ordered the 16 oz. New York strip steak, grilled.  This was a massive piece of meat.  I ordered it medium rare, but it came out entirely pink.  Our server picked up the steak and summoned a new one.  Unfortunately, this meant my girl would have to eat while I waited.  When I got my new steak, it seemed closer to medium rare, but it was straight-up cold in the middle.  Not wanting to wait for a third steak, I just ate it.  Fairly middle-of-the-road.  For sides, we ordered the Maui Onions, which my girlfriend loved.  They were a nice addition to any fork full of steak.  We also ordered the Potato Gratin.  Sadly, they tasted fairly bland.  We needed salt to bring them up to par.  Another deduction: A photographer came around to snap several pictures of us.  About 15 minutes later, she returned with books of photos she tried to sell us for something like $130.  We didn't see her snapping pictures of any other couples.  Nothing like having to shoot down a sales pitch in the middle of a fancy dinner.  While I liked the atmosphere and our server, the food fell short.  I really wish I'd enjoyed it more.",

I chose the organic lettuces salad and hamachi. The salad was lightly coated with a lemon vinegarette and pleasing as well as cleaning to the palate. The hamachi was perfect!  My main course was the 10 oz filet (the smallest you can order unless you order surf and turf). I cannot recall having a steak cooked more perfectly. It could have been cut with a butter knife.   And for dessert, I enjoyed a mixed fruit bowl which included a selection of berries, melon and my favorite....fresh fig.

I took my family here for a great Las Vegas steakhouse experience.  I chose this place because it blew me away the first time I tried it.  The anticipation and anxiety of wondering whether the same place could impress me twice was almost too much.  But I was just as impressed the second time which is why I'm spending the time to write a review!  Service: Just perfect to put it simply.  Not only did we have 2 servers, but everything was explained in great detail, including HOW we wanted the meal to be coursed.  Servers were polite and attentive, and at the end of our meal I joked that we wanted a post dessert snack and we were brought an additional plate of bites just to satisfy - no charge.  Food:  Can't say anything other than everything is amazing.  With that said, I recommend getting the chef's domestic wagyu selection.  You will get appetizers, salad, sides, main course and dessert.  Best value around!  I won't even go into detail about food specifics because Craftsteak exemplifies what it means to experience fine dining.  Be adventurous, because you will discover you like foods you have never enjoyed in your life.  Don't come here with hopes that it will be one of the best meals you've ever had.  Come here to set the expectation of all future steak houses to measure up to.  It's that good.  DO NOT trust any reviews on this restaurant below 4 stars.  Those people probably lost a little too much money on slot machines before they wrote it.",

    "text": "Craftsteak was an exceptional meal from beginning to end. We've tried Craft before in LA, but Craftsteak is definitely my favorite out of the two. Service was topnotch and the food was excellent. We had the lobster bisque, which was the best one I've ever had. The bisque was so flavorful and fragrant, and had huge chunks of perfectly cooked lobster. It's even poured table side to give a little pizzazz. I also had the caesar salad, which tasted great. My only complaint would be the whole anchovies served on top of the salad. (It's weird seeing little slivers of fish sitting on top of your salad, at least to me.)  We wanted to try two different preparations of steak, so we had the NY strip (which is grilled) and the TBone (which is roasted). I'm really glad we chose two extremely different ones because it was the best way to taste the subtle differences in each. The NY strip had a really great charred, smokey flavor. The TBone has a much softer, buttery texture and is more mild (less of that heavy \"meaty\" taste). I preferred the NY strip, but the TBone was more interesting and unique.  For sides we had the potato gratin and the hen of the woods mushroom. We had a hard time picking the mushrooms because I wanted to get just one type ( I thought the the assortment was a little too expensive at $24 compared to the $14 for one). Our server explained each and we ended up choosing the hen, which has a smokey, robust flavor. Both the gratin and mushroom paired perfectly with our steak.  We skipped dessert because we were too full, but it looked appetizing so I'd recommend trying to save some room for dessert. Out of the three steakhouses I've tried in Vegas (the other two being SW and Stripsteak), this is hands down my favorite. To me, it has the best ambience and dining experience, and most importantly, the best preparation of steak.",

Chef Tom Colicchio is emphatic when it comes to creating menu items that appeal to all lovers of fine food. Using only the finest ingredients from small family farms and other specialized venues, every dish bursts with flavor.   With a long wait in line for this renowned restaurant, I suggest you make reservations a head of time vs just dropping in. Walking into the restaurant the ambiance had hip/sleek vibe. A lounge area is located in front were it is packed with socialistic people and far into the back is the dinning area. The birthday celebrants orders were to order all the best meat we could eat!   Starters: ooohh warm toasted bread, (tasted like hawaiian bread/pandesal, but I'm sure it was freshly hand made. Appetizers: Baby Beets & a Pickled Egg salad & Warm Frisee Salad -results? Amazing!! Organic and the taste felt like our salads were hand picked.   Main entrees: Prime Filet Mignon, Prime Ribeye, and the Braised Short Ribs-Results? Top grade A meat, prepared medium rare w/juices flowing through every bite. The braised Short ribs were so tender, picture tender meat sliding right off the bone. For side dishes: Asparagus, Maui onions, Baby spinach and Baby Shiitake Mushrooms all prepared perfect!   Desserts:Milk Chocolate Creme Brulee and Chocolate Souffle-made you feel like ordering seconds- enough said! lol  *TIP-It is expensive but worth every dollar!!",

My husband was seated with a view of the room and said I should turn around to see the well-orchestrated bustle of the staff. I had barely turned back to the table when the manager was at my side, concerned that I had turned around because there was an issue with our visit.  The food was also superb. We both had the grilled NY strip, the potato gratin, and the sauteed spinach. We also split the Caesar salad, which would have been enough for three people to share as a starter. We enjoyed every bit of our dinner. Can't wait to visit again!",

Neat opportunity to try some rare/expensive wines by the glass thanks to their stopper technology. Worth stopping by just for that!",

    "text": "3.5 stars  I don't want to write a book about the place, I just want to cover some bases so you are prepared to dine here. It's dark inside. Not romantic dark, but oddly too dark.   After reading a lot of reviews and seeking suggestions from the Yelp community, it was strongly suggested that we go for the tasting menu. We chose the Domestic Wagyu beef tasting at $140/person. A bit expensive of course, but we wanted to splurge so we did it despite our better judgement.   First of all, if this is the route you plan to take, please make sure you arrive with an empty stomach. The portion sizes would make Mr. Buca Di Beppo blush.   As part of the tasting, you are allowed (I say allowed b/c the chef is rather particular about what and how you order) to order appetizers, salads, two steak options, of which you cannot order the same cut and a dessert accompaniment. Yes, that much food!!  Cow:  The steaks were prepared medium and arrived a little closer to medium rare. I am fine with it, but my lady doesn't like it too rare. I mean, could we send it back? Of course. But it would be nice if they just follow what's ordered.   Sides:   Potato Gratin was ok. I hate this dish simply b/c made at home or at a high end restaurant, it doesn't matter. Once you cut into it you either need to eat every bite within moments or deal with the fact that it solidifies quickly and no longer tastes the way it should. Mushrooms were a huge hit, for me at least. Roasted, seasoned well and delicious!! Baby carrots were, well baby carrots.   Dessert:  Selections were incredible! Choco indulgence was my second fave. Chocolate mousse covered with chocolate ganache and served with house made chocolate ice cream. However, this took a back seat to their Monkeybread. Easily the most delicious dessert I've tasted, possibly ever. Sticky, gooey, caramel and nuts slathered over warm, soft and delicious monkeybread. Wow!!",

    "text": "Very solid steakhouse on the Strip. I have been to Craftsteak once, years ago (before I became a Yelper), and the experience was just as good as I remembered.   The service from start to finish was attentive and friendly without being overbearing. Our server was very polite and explained the menu thoroughly, then gave us enough time to make our decisions.  I ordered the Lemonhead Martini ($14), lobster bisque ($18), and my dining companion and I split the ribeye ($55) and an order of the corn (I can't remember the price on this one, I believe it was about $12). The server was very accommodating and the chef sliced the ribeye for us so we could share it.  The food was very good. The bread that they brought before the meal was amazing. Lightly salted, warm, soft, and melted in your mouth. The lobster bisque was poured table-side over chunks of lobster. It could have used a bit more seasoning, but it was enjoyable. The steak was perfectly done, medium-rare, and had great flavor. The corn was good, but unremarkable.   The best part of my meal was dessert! We ordered the Monkey Bread with pistachio instead of banana ice cream. The server mistakenly brought us vanilla ice cream, but they quickly caught the error and brought us the pistachio as well. On top of that, the server noticed that we didn't eat much of our corn, so she bought our dessert! I thought that it was a wonderful and thoughtful thing for her to do. The Monkey Bread was heavenly- it was basically like the best sticky bun that you'll ever have!  I'd come back just for that!   Overall, this is a great choice if you are in the MGM and in the mood for a steakhouse.",

    "text": "Oh man. I wanted to love this restaurant - so much. Big Top Chef fan, and after sampling Gordon Ramsay Steak I was looking forward to Craftsteak as well.   Arrived at about 5:45 on a Tuesday night. Christopher at the front was warm and welcoming - a pleasant surprise in Vegas! Seated right away, and my server was also warm and welcoming. Gave me a tour of the menu, complete with letting me know he could order half portions on appetizers or sides.   Going with his suggestions, I had a half portion of the heirloom tomatoes and the Wagyu skirt steak. Also added a half portion of broccoli.   House made rolls looked great - a bit of sea salt on the top. Fluffy and a bit greasy from the butter. Pretty good. Tomato appetizer: champagne vinaigrette and some salt. Very good. Broccoli: I love sauteed broccoli. So that was my first bite. I could barely cut through the stem, it was so undercooked. I love al dente, but this was almost raw.  Steak: came out in a kind of \"bowl\" in its juices. No spoon or serving utensils. So I asked if I should just take out with my fork, and the server said that most people take a few pieces out and dip into the sauce. Kind of strange, I have to admit. But I was looking forward to it. I'm so sad to say that it was just ok. Tender, cooked fine, but under seasoned and underwhelming. Huge portion - enough for two.   I only ate a few slices of the steak and about a quarter of the broccoli.  Bottom line: it wasn't bad - it was just ok. Gordon Ramsay Steak is leaps and bounds better, IMO.",

The sides (Brussel sprouts, potato puree, potatoes au gratin, mushroom assortment, squash) were mediocre. Our table of 7 loved the monkey bread for dessert.

    "text": "As far as highly expensive classic steakhouses go, Craftsteak was unremarkable. Highlight was the service- I must have had four different waiters and they managed to stay mostly coordinated. It seemed like we had one guy whose job it was to come by with a mustache and look pensively at the food.  In terms of the food itself, it was pretty good, but nothing whatsoever to differentiate itself from the infinite number of places you can go to spend well over a hundred dollars and get steaks a la carte with expensive large sides. I had gone to Cut at the Palazzo the night before and it was really spectacular. Biggest difference between the two places, although not particularly important, was the bread. Cut's bread was some of the best I've ever had whereas Craftsteak's aggressively buttered/salted rolls were surprisingly dry and tasteless.  I would like to add that my experience at Colicchio & Sons in New York had formed a very high expectation for this place- the name and prices were the only things I could find in common.",

    "text": "My hubby and I were excited to eat at CraftSteak since we hadn't been able to do so on our last visit to Vegas.  Knowing that Vegas is expensive ($24 for a glass of champagne that retails for $30 a bottle), we went to dinner expecting to drop some serious cash.  We had purchased a very nice bottle of Cabernet to take with us, expecting a corkage fee.  We walked in, were greeted warmly and taken promptly back to our nice table near the rear of the restaurant.  The ambiance is great (dress up or dress casual, everyone was there in a variety of attire) and there is staff aplenty.  The wine list is a leather binder, of course, and the menu was very straightforward.  When our server handed me the menu, I glanced at a section in the middle of the page and about gasped out loud.  Let's just say that hubby was having his own holy crap moment across the table while viewing the wine list.  A. Single. Glass. Of. Wine. $140.   Ok so the glasses varied from $14 up to $140.  We usually start with a glass of sparkling wine while eating appetizers or starters.  And we usually have soup or salad or a starter before the main meal.  And this is an a la carte restaurant so you have to order the sides you would desire (standard in a steakhouse of this caliber).  So all told, we were in to this meal for around $250 and we hadn't even factored in tax, tip, or the corkage fee (which turns out to be $50 a bottle).  The salads, soups and appetizers are $16 to $150 and their steaks and seafood entrees are between $40 and $350 (they have True Japanese a5 wagyu beef).  Sides are $14-20.  Now that I have filled you in on the freak out, which lasted about 15 minutes for me, let me tell you about the experience.  We ordered our glasses of white wine (Dr. Loosen Riesling and a Darioush Viognier), and set out to decide what to order.  Our server, Francisco, was very helpful in describing some of the sides and offering suggestions.  One thing he pointed out was the Beef Tasting option which was a certain price per person and was a bit like a tasting menu of three courses. The double R beef tasting was $125 per person and the domestic wagyu beef tasting was $155 per person.  The Japanese wagyu beef tasting was $275 per person. Since the domestic wagyu filet mignon was over $100 by itself, it seemed like a no brainer to us.  We decided to get the tasting menu and plunged in from there.  We were able to choose any three salads/soup and one appetizer, one steak each (they had to be different) and three side dishes. And the dessert course was a sampling for you.  We chose the Caesar salad, the spinach salad with port wine pears and walnuts, the lobster bisque and the shrimp cocktail (yes, a la 1982, but the most expensive of the appetizers so let's get our money's worth, right?).  Everything came out together and was served family style except the soup.  The salads were very good, not overdressed and not too heavy.  The soup was declared excellent but I didn't taste it.  The shrimp cocktail was 5 large perfectly cooked and chilled shrimp with lemon and zesty cocktail sauce.  Perfect with the white wine.  For our steaks, we chose the ribeye and the filet mignon (remember this is domestic wagyu).  The steaks came out already sliced and perfectly medium rare.  A True thing of beauty, folks.  Our sides were the spinach in garlic oil, the sweet corn with scallions, and the potato puree.  First, the sides. OMG the sweet corn (recommended by Francisco) was like eating popcorn with caramel.  The kernels were almost individually cooked to perfection.  The garlic spinach was great but nothing off the charts.  The creamy potatoes were wonderful...almost a whipped consistency and very flavorful.  Now, the meat.  The filet mignon was tender and juicy and everything you want a filet mignon to be.  The seasoning was just right, letting the beef shine on its own, as it should be.  But I think the winner of the night was the ribeye.  Also perfectly seasoned, it had a slight charred crust on the outside that lent it that extra special something.  Amazing.  Since we have a refrigerator in our suite, we had them box up the leftovers, of which there was quite a lot.  And just when we thought we were getting away slightly full but just happy, they brought the desserts.  Yes, I said desserts as in plural.  And not just a little sample - three freaking full sized desserts.  A bowl of sorbets (passion fruit and raspberry) and a chocolate peanut butter molten cake with vanilla gelato.  But the best thing there was the monkey bread with banana gelato....changed my world.  By the time we actually left, we were stuffed beyond belief.  During our meal, every server was attentive and polite and helpful.  The manager walked by when we were finishing our wine and chatted with us a bit.  It was the service you would expect and hope for at a restaurant of this caliber. A truly wonderful meal.",

They definitely don't make you feel that welcomed if you have kids. I'm sorry but we were hungry and no mood to eat fast food. Out of all the restaurants at the MGM, this seem the least fancy restaurant.   Anyhow, the steaks were delicious. My family member got the roasted New York strip and she said it was great. I had the hanger steak and it was pretty flavorful but a bit too salty for my taste. The pear martini was delicious although you pay $15 for a glass, I barely tasted any alcohol. The sides were spinach and the grits. The spinach was just typical sauteed spinach with garlic, however the grits were delicious. Very different version of mash potatoes.   Service was good but so slow. I have gone to the craft in Los Angeles and it was not even close to the service and attention you get there. I, personally thought the environment was just a little bit too stiff.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here for my birthday on 11/24/14.  We had the angus steak tasting menu.   I've been reading reviews until I was blue in the face trying to figure out how many courses and how the tasting menu worked. This is how it works.  Everything is family style except the soup. First, you get lobster bisque. Then they bring some appetizers - we had proscuitto with pears, an heirloom tomato salad with champagne vinaigrette and Italian buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts and balsamic. then you get your steak - we had ribeye and filet with sides - we had potato puree, brussel sprouts with bacon and roasted mushrooms Then, dessert - we had orange basil sorbet and rum raisin ice cream, a fruit plate and sweet potato cheesecake. Then, for my birthday, they brought out the monkey bread with banana ice cream.  My favorite parts were: the lobster bisque.  I love it anyway.  Hubby never had it and he loved it.  It comes to the table with just lobster in the bowl and then they pour the bisque over the top.  So, big chunks of lobster in the bisque.  I LOVED it.  The flavor was amazing (i think i tasted sherry in there, which is YUM).  I could eat a vat of that. the filet was perfect.  We ordered it medium rare to rare.  it was medium to medium rare, but it was melt in your mouth delicious.  The ribeye was great too, but next to the filet, it was definitely second fiddle (as you would expect).   the monkey bread with banana ice cream - this was just perfect perfect perfect.  I was sad I had to share.  the not so great: proscuitto. - i like proscuitto, but it was just proscuitto on a plate.  come on, man. rum raisin ice cream - way to boozy.  the raisins must have been soaked in rum and then covered in rum and then tossed in rum and then the ice cream was mostly rum.  super rum rum rum.  ew.  There is SO MUCH food.  Hubby and I left some behind - we were very sad.  and we practically rolled out. so, bring your appetite if you get the tasting menu.   Now that I've done it, I will probably go back and just get the bisque, filet and monkey bread, but I suggest giving the tasting menu a shot at least once.    the wait staff was incredible.  It was a fine dining experience that wasn't stuffy or uncomfortable.  Blue was our main waiter and he was just so great - helpful and accommodating and just plain nice.  There was another waiter that stopped by here and there to make sure everything was perfect and I wish I could remember his name, but he was really nice and personable as well.  Only one bad thing, there was a photographer who came around and took some seriously cheesy posed pictures.  Then, later came back with them all printed out to sell to us.  I didn't even like the pictures.  I didn't want this intrusion.  I hope they stop this practice.  All in all a great experience.  I was torn on where to spend my birthday dinner and ultimately chose Craftsteak because I knew both me and hubby would enjoy it and I have ZERO regrets.  I think this is going to be one of our must stops in vegas from now on.",

    "text": "So where do you take a bachelor for his steak dinner? Craftsteak!  A group of four of us arrived a little earlier than our reservations, they were still setting up the restaurant but the hostesses were cool with us coming in a little earlier. The interior is pretty subdued but classy, very warm. The booths give you a little privacy with their chainmail dividers and adequate seats.  Our waiter was pretty cool, and the water guy... great job; he knows a thirsty Brian when he sees one. He came around and checked on us just enough and was never annoying.  We all ordered the domestic Wagyu prix fixe menu. It's 3 courses with a multitude of dishes per course. I've read other reviews that said they received three dishes per course, but we ended up with 4-6.  The starters consisted of a Wagyu beef tartare that was well spiced and my personal favorite. The grilled prawns were nice as was the salad. the braised baby artichokes were very tender and helped offset the meats.  I also ordered foie gras which was a large portion and nicely done with some dates on the side. A couple of the guys weren't too impressed with the starters and became anxious that the rest of the meal might follow suit.   Then came the meat. Four steaks all cooked to perfection and served with a grilled shallot. Ranging in order from great to outstanding; filet mignon, ribeye, flatiron and then the strip.  I've heard people say that they've had a piece of food just melt in their mouth. However the flatiron literally did that while I was eating. The strip steak is perhaps THE best steak I've ever had in my life. We all agreed that the steaks were life changing. The sides varied from amazing to not so bad. They followed a very americana  platform with a very small twist. The mushrooms in particular were devoured fast with the Enoki's tanginess standing out from the rest.  Ok, so... we came to a steak house... had the meat... mission accomplished. Until the server came up and nearly slapped us for not saving room to eat the third course. They brought a deluge of sweet tasty bits to the table.  Monkey bread, liquid chocolate cake, chocolate souffle, fresh berries, warm berry crisp, a selection of sorbets and bread pudding.  Wow... I really mean that too. Everything was amazing, we each had favorites but had a hard time putting them in order of favorites because they each made us angry. Why angry? Well, my friend James stopped our waiter to complain. Saying \"I'm angry because I will never in my life be able to find dessert this good except for here.\"  The waiter didn't know how to react so we sent him on his confused way.  We're some heavy appetite kind of guys. We'd like to think if we were trapped in a cave by a wall of hot dogs that we could eat our way to safety. However they really overload you with food here. I think there was a noticeable wobble in our steps as we exited the place.  For four of us it came out to about $740 or so plus a few drinks and tip. The dress was business casual and it never got too loud to hold a conversation. I'd love to come back here next time I'm in town.",

The wagyu tar tar and rib eye were also so, so, good and I spent many years working in steak houses; so, I'd like to think I know a good steak when I try it. Even the potato gratin side left me raving.   The wine list is extensive and there is something for everyone.   Service was great. I also loved the modern decor and the big booths.

    "text": "One of my best meals as of June 2009.  I have tried 'WichCraft in SF and was impressed from the execution of concept by Chef Collicchio. I am a big fan of Top Chef but I was not going to let that create a biased opinion. I was staying at the MGM so I chose to have dinner at SteakCraft.  Started with Foie Gras (perfectly done with cherry chutney) and Fresh Oysters from the east coast (cant remember which) which tasted fresh out of the sea.   Entree selection was the grilled 16 oz. Ribeye prepared Rare. It was incredibly moist and tender (melted in my mouth). Despite the delicate interior of the steak, the outside did not lack the punch. There was a nice smoky flavor on the exterior, which was also well seasoned. Fresh thyme leaves enhanced the 1-2 punch combo contrast of a well flavored, savory-smoky exterior with a butter-soft interior.   Sides were Mushroom Assortment, Garlic-Leek Gratin, Snap Peas.  Mushrooms each had their distinct flavor and texture. My favorite was the White Shimeji which had been flavored with butter but texture was delicate. The Garlic-Leek Gratin was so silky smooth (although bad for the heart) was very soothing to the soul. The Snap Peas were crunchy and cooked to perfection, allowing the natural flavor of the peas to be first priority.   The service was executed flawlessly. As my table was ready to straggle out, we were gifted with a generous serving of sorbet and gelato. We started with the Strawberry, and systematically moved to the Peach, Black Cherry, Malt Chocolate, Carmel, finishing with Pistaccio. Each was rich with flavor, no cutting corners here.   As a True steak destination, the selection was well available. From Roasted to Grilled, from Lean to Marble to Super Marble (Wagyu and A5), there is something for everyone. But it's not just the high quality of meat that enters the restaurant (all implications intended), it's the preparation and technique that truly masters the bull by the horns. Chef Collicchio and Executive Chef Seeber have masterfully subdued this animal. Hats off to you!",

    "text": "This restaurant is incredible.  I ate here by myself on a Sunday night while in Vegas for business.  My server was very helpful, and helped me pick great sides and wine to compliment my braised beef short ribs.   My meal started with the lobster bisque.  It was perfectly creamy with huge chunks of delicious lobster.  The braised beef was so delicious and tender.  Every last bite melted in my mouth.  I had the Jerusalem artichokes and garlic baby broccoli on the side.  The Jerusalem artichokes  were an an assuming and non-distracting compliment to the rest of the meal.  The broccoli was perfectly cooked- still a little crunchy- and I could have had another order.    I foolishly ordered dessert even though I was very, very full.  The raspberry sorbet was alright.    Overall, this was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I won't visit Vegas against without a trip to Craftsteak.",

The apps were all quite good and I had perhaps the best bowl of lobster bisque I've ever tasted.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was that you definitely pay for the experience. If you're in the mood for great steak though, this is the place to go.  I'd highly recommend it, and definitely plan to go back.",

At craft the lowest \"grade\" is 7 for there porterhouse, rib eye or new york strip. My bf and I had the ribeye for 2. It was amazing 32ounces of meat! They serve it in a large pan pre cut into slices and cooked perfectly. Our steak was accompanied by ala carte mash potatoes aka potato puree and sauteed corn. Pricey but worth every bite. A couple is looking to spend a minimum of $150 and def. more if you buy alcohol. The service was quick, friendly and attentive. The restaurant was very nice. Hopefully next time I'm in Vegas ill win big money and will be able to try their Japanese steak (grade 12) that cost $165 for 6 ouunces.lol Great steak house. I LOVE STEAK!",

Despite sitting at the bar, however, the ambiance was perfect with low lighting, fresh baked breads, and very curteous staff. The food is the average american fare of steaks, sea food, and salads; prepared with simple ingredients, served a la carte, at not so simple prices.  One filet and one steak, asparagus and garlic potatoes au gratin on the side, chased down by two jack daniels and a coke: $175.00.  Good food, but not worth the price.",

The side of potato's weren't cooked enough. they were still hard in the center... the seasoning was delish... so we are sure that if fully cooked... they'd be great.  Steak was fine... We liked our Ruth's Chris experience better. The \"warmed plates\" and skillets, were not very warm, and our steaks were quickly chilled. The sweet potato side was cinnamon-y goodness!!  The cocktails... Raspberry Martini and the Agave Martini were to DIE for... The Bartender's better work it!!!!!! We were surprised with a comp'd dessert cause of our nuptials... and the Dessert Chef... WOOOOOHOO!!!! The vanilla bean cheesecake melted in our mouths... and it even said CONGRATS on the plate.

I admit that I wanted to eat here because I love the show \"Top Chef\" and am a Tom Colicchio fan. But honestly, the steak was truly excellent.  Also very good was the lobster bisque and the Caesar salad. Especially the creamy bisque. Great bread and butter. However, the sides were very disappointing - the creamed Yukon golds were underwhelming, the mushroom risotto was too salty, and the garlic and leek potatoes au gratin were too watery. The service was very attentive, although one of the servers was a little pushy about trying to get us to do the Chef's Tasting Menu.   A very very expensive restaurant but the steak is superior. My fiance, a red meat connoisseur, declared it was the best steak he has had outside of Peter Luger in Brooklyn, NY. That pretty much says it all.",

We has 4 people working our table, which was a little overwhelming because every so often they would check in \"is everything to your  liking?\" but it was 4 different people!! They were nice, but it was too much.  The starters were delicious! Spinach salad and grilled Hawaiian prawns... the spinach was tossed with a heavenly truffle oil, and  the prawns were grilled and juicy, lots of flavor. (was surprised that  they were served with a side of cocktail sauce , there was a cocktail shrimp item on the menu, but I wanted something hot)  We got the Porterhouse for 2 and a side of asparagus and french  fries -- wow!! That was a TON of food, by the way - the portions are  generous. The side were great, but the meat was not.  Our steak lacked flavor and was tasted gamey depending on the bite. It was a big flop and we kept wishing we were having that perfect steak experience - but it fell flat.  Oh well, the wine was good and after we paid $250 we left feeling like there was something missing... that centerpiece steak just didn't hit the spot.",

The bone in rib eye ordered medium rare came out properly cooked and was very flavorful.  The gf had the filet medium which was also very good.  Had the surf and turf with the diver scallops which was the best scallops I've ever had.  Great recommendation by the waiter.  I also enjoyed the risotto with the wild mushrooms.  The salad was a little bland but it's only a small part of the meal.    The mojito was nice and so was the glass of pinot noir.  The only downside to Craftsteak is the price which I understand due to it's location on the strip.  Seems almost every high end steakhouse on the strip is a minimum of $50 with inflated prices on appetizers and sides.  $50 gets you a 16oz bone in rib eye and $64 gets u a surf and turf with three scallops to go along with the 8 oz filet.  I certainly would visit Craftsteak again but I also agree with many reviewers about the lack of value for your buck especially in a city with so many alternatives.",

    "text": "Some AAA 4 Diamond restaurants are way too stuffy and elitist. Some try way too hard to fit in and be approachable to the \"average\" diner. Craftsteak is just right. The staff here makes everyone who takes the time to make a reservation here (and it takes forever, thanks MGM) really feel special and welcome. After all, if I'm dropping $100+ on dinner anywhere, it really should be special, and I'd better be welcome.  The service staff here is so polite, and professional, and friendly, and attentive. I've also never noticed so much as a hint of snobbery from any of the staff here; average Joe's are treated just like movers and shakers, captains of industry, or movie stars, or her Majesty, the Queen.   Anyway, the food (kinda why I've been here three times). This may sound crazy, but the dinner rolls here are consistently the best part of the meal, and that is by no means a let-down. They are warm, pillowy, yeasty rolls with melted butter and sea salt on top. They're crispy like a wafer on top, luxuriously rich in the middle, come out of the pan steaming hot, and with even more whole butter on top, they're the perfect bread course.  Side note: The table butter was not cold, and neither was it so warm that I couldn't spread it. Perfect bread with perfect butter.   I had the lobster bisque for my appetizer. It was warm, silky, lobster-y goodness, and there's like half a tail's worth of lobster in the bottom. It's a great way to start a steak dinner.   This time around I opted for the ribeye. It was a prime ribeye. It weighed 16 oz with a bone before it was cooked. It was beautifully cooked. It was rested, but still hot. There were some delicious herbs and some buttery goodness on the steak, but neither was a detriment. The steak was perfect.    Side dishes were no afterthoughts, either. Spring pea risotto with tender braised pork was the best risotto I've eaten in my life. I'm baffled as to how they made it. Spring ramps were sauteed simply and paired well with the steaks, and some perfectly roasted hen of the woods mushrooms were a lot of a very good thing.   Thank God I saved room for desert.   I was going to try the monkey bread pudding, but when I saw a chocolate souffle with hazelnut ice cream, I almost died. When the dish arrived , I popped the top, poured the caramel sauce down the hatch, and tried it with some ice cream.   Wow.   That's all I can say about that. If you've read this far down on this review, thank you! But, also please try the chocolate souffle at Craftsteak. I will probably never taste anything so delicious in my life.",

    "text": "First some disclaimers.  My rating is within the context of other, high end steak houses not all restaurants.  Second, it reflects both food and service and 3rd, I did not have the Wagyu beef which seems to be his signature item.  My wife and I arrived for a Friday night, 8:30 reservation and were pleasantly greeted and seated.  After a few minutes our server came to the table, introduced himself and his \"team\".  So far so good.  Then he left to fetch some waters.  Next a different server, part of his team arrived and promptly asked us for our order.  This is the first turn off.  How about a cocktail?  OH, sure he said and took our order.  Came back with the drinks and then said ok are you ready to order?  Ah, no, we have not even sipped our drink yet.  He got the message and left.  Returned before we were done and again asked for our order. Surrendering to the idea he was in a hurry to get us served and out, we ordered.  Then, we over hear another waiter presenting the menu to the table behind us. He went over the prefix options, described the main courses and sides, etc.  Hey, we never got this.  I would have probably ordered the chefs selection after hearing about it.  We got our food shortly after ordering.  We both had bone in rib eye and split a side of spinach.  Steaks were cooked medium rare as requested.  They were appropriately fatty and tender.  I liked the slight application of a finishing salt on top and light dusting of a balsamic reduction with Thyme.    Overall, steaks were good, I would say competitive with other high end steakhouses but nothing that blew me away.    Ambiance is \"Craftsman\" reflecting the name I guess.  Kind of rustic I would say.  Overall, an ok but not great experience dampened by the \"bums rush\" feeling we got from our server who was clearly the second team.",

We got sat at a table right in front of the arrangement of pumpkins which made for a nice background for our group picture.   We ordered three side dishes: baby spinach, baby shitake mushrooms, and roasted garlic and leek gratin potatoes. I didn't try any of the spinach, but the other two were really good. We also shared between the four of us a 16 oz. rib eye and a 10 oz. filet mignon since we had gone to a buffet for lunch. Hmm.. the rib eye was so good! The filet mignon was really tender in the center, but the side was a little dry otherwise it would have been better. Plus, it lacked a little bit in flavor. We didn't get to order any dessert since we were all full. =( I think next time I will have to save room for the chocolate souffle!",

    "text": "I can honestly say this was the best meal of my life.   My BF and I started at the bar and we had done well that day at the tables, so we ordered a bottle of champagne. The bartender was awesome, so friendly, and helped us pick out just the right choice. Once the table was ready, they expertly handled the transfer of the champagne to the table, so it was just waiting for us - on ice - when we got there.   We had 2 waiters who were both awesome, and we were sitting next to David Spade, which kind of added to the snob appeal...lol. (Funny side note...he was with a super hot chick and a Chris Farley look-alike, and was sitting on his KNEES in the booth the whole time. Like a kid. Weird.)  We started with the Charcuterie Sampler...I had never heard of this, but it's like a selection of fine shaved meats (mostly raw). I believe there was raw bacon in there and it was heavenly.   The waiter paced the evening perfectly, and he helped me select my meal. I went with the filet medium rare paired with Diver Sea Scallops. You got to choose a sauce on the side so I went with the bernaise. Now, I am a HUGE steak fan/snob so it took a lot for me to go with the scallops and not just get a huge Flinstone-style hunk of meat. But the waiter did not steer me wrong.   Seriously, it was food porn. I could not stop looking at it, talking about it, tasting it, etc. The steak was cooked to perfection and the scallops were the best seafood I've ever had in my life. They had a sort of sweet, almost mapley flavor, and I was seriously bummed when there were gone. I did not share one bite.   I don't remember what my BF had...sorry was just too obsessed with my meal.   Everything about this place was perfect. I am trying Prime next month so I'll let you know how that compares!  Oh - the cab driver on the way there was very impressed we were going there and said it's known as the best steakhouse in Vegas.   Go! Enjoy!",

Looks like a dinner roll, tastes like Challah.  When they say don't eat the bread to save room for the meal...it's ok in this instance.  Eat the bread.  It's so freaking good.  Porterhouse- medium rare. Delicious but I still think Mastros is the best steak house.    Wagyu- medium rare.  Better than Cut but I still like the porterhouse better. (Personal preference)  Risotto- my favorite side dish of the night. SO, so good.  Just the right amount of flavor-- not overly salty but packed with flavor.  Cooked to perfection.  Mashed potato puree- this is the best \"mashed\" potatoes I've ever had.  I thought I always liked lumpy mashed potatoes but that's only bc I've never had potatoes as smooth as Stripsteak made them.  Sorry mastros, as much as I love the lobster mashed, Stripsteak wins this category.  Sweet potatoes- also very delicious.  Simple cubed sweet potatoes with brown sugar crust.  My 2nd favorite side after the risotto.  Beet salad- not a show-stopper but not bad.  Your typical.  Feel like the beets were too chopped up (small).    Key Lime pie- best key lime pie I've ever had.  I don't typically like tart desserts, but dang this pie was good.  The crust was how a pie crust should be-- and sweet, crunchy yet crumbly; the silky filling melted in my mouth and was oh so smooth.  The flavor was awesome.  Not the fanciest dessert out there but don't let the simplicity fool you-- that was probably one of the best desserts I've ever had.",

The rolls are great and I recommend you start with the lemon drop and key lime martini.  Advice. If you're going to try the Kobe Steak, don't go cheap on it. A skirt steak will be a skirt steak whether it's a Kobe or not so don't order it unless you like that cut. A friend did this because he wanted to try a Kobe steak and he wasn't impressed with what he got. Go with the rib eye. The mashed potatoes are great too. Honestly this is my all time favorite place to eat. I've tried the other steak houses- Carnevino, Gallhagers, Masteros... this is it.   It will be pricey, we usually spend $200-$250 for two but it's worth it. Soooo worth it.  Oh, and I've never had bad service here.",

I ordered the Rib Eye and it was cooked just to order, along with a side of delicious fingerling potatoes.

    "text": "The food here is mediocre at best!  I guess when the waiter \"suggests\" the tasting menu, that might be the only thing good...everything else on the menu tasted salty and the chefs failed to cook our steaks twice!        We came here and decided to go straight to the entrees & sides.  My friends shared the ribeye, new york strip, and t-bone.  None of these were american or japanese kobe, just the regular steaks.  First, our steaks didnt even come out on time...they brought out two steaks and sides, then 5mins later our third steak arrives...cmon chefs you can do better than that!  Second, the first two steaks that came out (new york strip and ribeye) were cold and overcooked.  When I say cold I dont mean \"warm,\" it was luke-warm at best..it tasted as if it had been sitting on the counter for 10min... Third, they overcooked the steak, or maybe it was sitting on the counter for so long that the steak kept cooking and also became cold at the same time..who knows, either way the steaks came out medium and medium-well, when we asked for medium-rare.     We told the waiter about our unsatisfied steaks, and he took our steaks back and had them recook it without questions!  A+ on the waiter's part for taking back our steaks NO QUESTIONS ASKED...unfortunately he tried to double charge us on our bill!      We also ordered sides of mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and sauteed brocolli.  The mashed potatoes were very good!  The mushrooms and broccoli were way too salty!  Our t-bone steak came out okay, but i felt like the meat was a little bit tough and didnt have much flavor...then again I hardly eat t-bone.  So we waited and waited for our two steaks to come back, the waiter swung by a couple times to tell us our steaks would be here shortly..but it took almost 25min for our steaks to come back..way too long in my opinion!  Finally our steaks came back, but this time the steaks were way too rare!  The waiter tells us he cooked it rare+ (which is somewhere between medium-rare and rare).  But, we didnt ask for rare+, we asked for medium rare...the rare+ was raw on the inside, it looked almost rare, and the inside was not even cooked (it was cold).   Of  course, at this point we were dissapointed and didnt want to tell the waiter to take it back again (it might have taken another 20min of our time).   We decided to eat the side pieces of the meat and avoid the rare parts..the ribeye was actually a good piece of meat, but its hard to eat rare meat.   The new york was a little chewy, but that could be because it was undercooked!          Another thing to add to our experience here was the waiter kept dissapearing on us, we waited almost 30min for our check, and once he brought our food out, he would dissapear for 15-20min...service was way too slow here...we even asked the other waitress to get our check, but she insisted our waiter would be here shortly.         Overall, this place failed to deliver quality steaks and service.  The service was slow, they kept us waiting on food and our check, which makes a very unhappy customer.  The steaks we ordered weren't from the \"recommended\" menu, maybe thats why they didnt turn out good, but i'd expect quality food on the whole menu!   The chefs really need to learn to time the entrees, all food should come out at once.  The steak also needs to be cooked right, which the chefs failed to do!             Ohh one last point, when we sent back our steaks, the waiter tried to bill us twice for both the steaks, we notice'd a double charge on our bill..pretty shady by the waiter!  He tried to play it dumb when we told him, but it was so obvious he tried to double charge us for no reason...bad food and service overall!  But maybe its because we didnt order from the tasting menu, which is 100+ per person.",

The ambiance was cool, the service was amazing, but the food was crap. My BF and I are steak lovers and we make it a point to try all the steakhouses we can. Sooooo based on the reviews on yelp, we thought we would give this place a shot. Big mistake. We ordered that Kobe aged crap they had and it was horrible AND it's not supposed to be! Also, the lobster I ordered was super rubbery and the lobster bisque was yuck. Actually, the side of wild mushrooms was the only thing that saved the meal - plus the bottle of red wine. Urgh...just thinking about it all over again makes me so mad - Never again.",

The foie gras was warm & the figs were cold-I wish the figs had been heated and carmelized slightly. Mr Q had the roasted filet mignon for $54-he said it was a good cut of meat but lacked flavor & oomph. I had the kobe waygu style flat iron for $64 and it was small but tasty. We also had the mushroom assortment for $24. BEST part of the meal, hands down. Total damage for 2 steaks, 2 apps and a side, and 2 cocktails? About $270 with tax. NOT worth it, IMO for what you get-I've had much better and more memorable meals for half the price. We wanted to really treat ourselves on this trip & this meal did not feel like anything special except for the price tag.",

Bisque was really good.  We all shared the sauteed spinach, potato pure, au gratin potatoes and the maui onions.  The au gratin potatoes and maui onions were amazing.  Definitely try those.  One buddy got the Australian Wagyu Skirt Steak which he all let us try.  It was ridiculous don't get me wrong... but will cost you $170 bucks for 8 oz.  It is Vegas but the prices are high but not necessarily unjustified.  The reason it is 3 stars is the service was all over the place.  It took us 1.5 hours to get our steak which they did apologize for but still.  Our waiter was corky as hell, could barely be heard and tried making jokes that made zero sense.  He made the experience awkward when he was around but we just dismissed it for him being kookie.  The food is worth it we just had really long and weird service.",

    "text": "We had such high expectations for Craftsteak.  Being avid fans of Top Chef, we were excited for our amazing meal.  Started out by waiting 20 minutes for our reservation - it was a Saturday night at 8pm, so I will let that one slide.  But when the bartender was rather rude to my friend about not having her ID, and therefore not allowing her to sit at the bar, I started to think otherwise.  Now onto the food...the bread they serve is amazing.  I wish I could have eaten that all night.  Two of us ordered the surf and turf - mine with scallops, my friend with lobster.  First, they served us the wrong meal - I got her lobster and vice versa.  This is a big deal to me - at such an expensive restaurant, you do not serve the wrong meal to someone!  Then we realize we have the wrong steaks and had to switch - but both were overdone. Seafood-wise, my friends lobster was overcooked, but my scallops were delicious.    We also ordered the mashed potatoes - those were amazing.  Looking back, we should have sent back our steak and her lobster.  When we were leaving, I saw someone else send back their steak.  I hope this was a fluke night for Craftsteak and they usually have better luck not overcooking the food.  Overall, nice atmosphere, OK service, dissapointing food.",

    "text": "We made 6:45 pm reservations for the day before New Year's Eve for just my husband and me.  We arrived a little early, at which time the hostess directed us to the bar area.  The decor was simplistic, lots of wood and stone features.  Love the pendant lighting.  After about 5 minutes, we were directed to our table which was at the end of an aisle of tables and parallel against a divider.  I liked this and was glad that they didn't place us in one of those side by side tables, next to another 2 party table.  Those just lack the privacy you sometimes need.  The server immediately approached us to give us our menus, which we actually viewed online prior to dinner.  On the menu, you can order the dishes individually or you can opt to go with one of their tasting menu options.    Because we have never tried kobe beef and were quite curious to know what the big deal was, we began considering the domestic kobe wagyu tasting menu.  It was $130/pp and included three courses.  I wanted clarification, so I asked the server what it specifically included.  He was very informative.  The first course included selections from their appetizers and salads.  The main course was your choice of cut, which was accompanied by sides.  Then the last course was selections of dessert.  The food comes out almost like family style so that both my husband and me could sample a little of everything.  The server gave us examples of combinations that we could order.  After he left, we started deciding on what cuts we wanted and the different selections for the first course and our sides and were finally set on our order.  Well, this is where Craftsteak lost its fifth star...  All of a sudden, another server comes to our table.  Although very cordial, he asks us if we are ready to order.  We just assumed that maybe the other server went on break or something, so we tell the gentleman that we are both having the domestic kobe beef tasting menus.  He asks us if we have any dietary restrictions or allergies and then takes our menu.  We were all ready to tell him our selections for the first course, our sides, and our cuts for our steak, but he didn't ask for any.  So after giving him a confused and perplexed look, I asked about what items would we be getting for our first course or what would they be bringing out.  He said the chef chooses samplings of their more popular dishes or signature dishes.  Being new to this, we basically just nodded and said alright.  A few minutes later, we spotted the first server and called him over to express our concerns, since he gave us the impression that we could choose our first course and our cuts.  The first server came back, reported to us what was specifically was ordered and if that was okay.  We ended up getting the ribeye and the filet mignon for our cuts.  The first course samplings were fine, but we wished we could have had some say in the dessert selections.  Recommendation:  If this should happen to you, know that you have full say in what selections can be ordered for your tastings.    Now for the taste...I can't exactly remember the names of our first course selections, but we were wonderfully satisfied.  Although a little on the salty side, the red cabbage with fried goat cheese and crostini was yummy.  The cucumber salad was refreshing.  Prosciutto was alright, nothing that really wowed us.  Fresh baked rolls were mmm, mmm good.  Don't let the look or presentation deceive you.  I love me some good bread and this was heavenly bread.  It looks store bought, but it is so fresh, soft with slight salt flavor on top.  This made us fool quick.  The ribeye was good.  I think I was expecting a little more; it was a little tougher than I thought it would be.  It may have been because we ordered med-well.  Flavor was excellent though.  Filet mignon though, was a whole other story.  Wow....I have never tasted beef like this.  We savored every bit of those 6 slices.  The special sauce made for each of the cuts also brought out their flavors.  The accompanied mushroom risotto, asparagus, and surprising Maui onion were all so good.  Fabulous sides.  I never thought I would have loved onion so much.  We began slowing down after 4 slices of steak each.  Warning:  It's definitely a lot of food for two people.  We boxed up a lot to take home.  I was really excited about dessert, but was a little disappointed.  The pear sorbet and the cranberry crisp with ginger ice cream were probably my favorites.  The orange basil ice cream tasted a little like I had just licked a smudge of lotion off my hand.  Not to my liking.  The vanilla bean cheesecake was good, but a little too heavy.    All in all, service was outstanding.  The system of ordering could have been a bit clearer.  Food was the best we have eaten for a steakhouse.  Not stuffy or too formal for a high priced dining experience.  Decor and ambiance were pleasant.  i would go back again.  We're missing the filet...it does melt in your mouth!!!",

The server, David, and the entire staff were attentive, pacing our evening perfectly, as you cannot rush this eating process.  We chose the 3 course Chef's selection with red wine pairing.  The appetizer course had 4 different choices, with the frisse salad and pacific prawns being our favorite.  The Jordan Cab was the perfect pairing.  Main course provided 2 types of meat, Filet and Ribeye, melt in your mouth steaks, cooked perfectly.  Accompaniments of potatoes and asparagus rounded out the entrees. The wine a Pejuu CAB very dry and brought out the flavors of the meat.  Dessert, was seriously an OMG moment!  The monkey bread with cinnamon icecream made me not care how many miles I had to run on the treadmill the next day.  I don't know what is in this pastry, but it was truly the best ending to the evening.  We left full, happy, and a little credit card shocked, wine pairing was more than we thought, but well worth it.  YOU MUST try this place when in Vegas.  Take your time, do not rush through the evening, and you will be very happy!!",

    "text": "We took out a group of buyers to Craftsteak last week and I was very disappointed with the experience.  The staff was very friendly and they did accommodate our request to increase our party from 7 to 10 people very quickly and graciously.    As for the food I have eaten at many other steakhouses and i did not feel the food was on par for the price.  I ordered the Lobster bisque and the 10 ounce fillet.  The lobster bisque was very tasty and the bread that was given to the table was also very tasty however the Steak was a different story.    I had ordered the steak medium-well with a little pink in the middle and it was served well done.  Not only was my steak overcooked, but my colleagues steak were served either cold or overcooked as well.     For desert I had ordered the donuts and they told me the donuts were out, so i ordered the banana bread which was pretty good.    Overall i think for the price you pay the food is average.  I think there are many better steakhouses to choose from and I don't think I would do dinner here again.",

As a group we shared the side dishes (everything is a la carte) and each ordered some form of steak. I shared the dry-aged ribeye and was EXTREMELY disappointed. You would think that with a 96$ steak for two, it would melt in your mouth like butter and be full of flavor. The steak was tough and and just as tough to cut. Boy, was I wrong! Side dishes---mushroom risotto was undercooked and had mushrooms layered on top rather than within, grilled asparagus with some pieces overdone, sweet potato puree was worse than baby food. My friend's ribeye was overcooked as well as she ordered it medium rare but arrived with very little pink! If you're going for the NAME and reputation of Tom, then enjoy. If you're going for the food, you're almost better off at Outback Steakhouse! Then you wouldn't have wasted over $600 on your dinner bill!!!",

    "text": "Well, like others have said, this was a VERY disappointing experience.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!  I love Tom and have been wanting to come here since I heard he had a restaurant in Vegas.  However, service was awful.  Others have said this as well.  My waiter took forever to come over and take my drink order, and forever to come back to take my food order, and i had to practically flag him down throughout the meal whenever i need anything like, i don't know, a pesky refill.  Pissed me off really, because, as usual, I was dining alone, and i felt like I was being ignored somewhat for this reason.  What, you don't think you'll get as big of a tip?  Because I noticed he was really friendly with some of his more populated tables.  Plus, I had a relatively early dinner reservation, and there was no reason for him to take a hundred years to return to check on me, since the restaurant was not full when I was there.  Anyway, in addition to the service, i was highly disappointed in the food overall.  I ordered the Wagyu filet - I think.  It might have been the Kobe filet mignon.  See, that's evidence right there how terrible it was because I LOVE cow and I can't even remember what I ate here.  All I know is it was a filet since that's all i order and it was ~$125 for 10 ounces or so, a la carte.  Now, I ordered it well done, and that may have been part of the problem, because other posts have mentioned getting the steak at medium or medium rare doneness.  I understand that you preserve the taste of the meat this way, especially with really expensive cuts, but I personally prefer not to hear Moo's or have my dinner walking off my plate, so I'm sticking to fully cooked.  To me, the mark of a great steakhouse is whether they can properly cook a steak well done and leave it juicy, and in the case of filet mignon, i feel like butterflying it is cheating.  But i digress.  I ordered the damn steak well done and it sucked bigtime.  I kept wanting to ask for A1 steak sauce all night, but I fought the urge since it seemed inappropriate to slather such a nice piece of meat in sauce.  (However, when I got to my room later and saw the 6 ounces of steak leftovers I had remaining, I silently kicked myself for not grabbing some A1 from the cafe downstairs in the hotel).    In addition to the dreadful steak, I had what was possibly the worst accompanying side dish EVER.  I am speaking of the Tuscan Kale - capitalized because of its notoriety.  Ordinarily, I love kale, and I especially love bacon.  I mean, what could go wrong here?  EVERYTHING!  The dish was WAY too salty (I don't care if it over-reduced in the pot or the bacon makes it saltier - shouldn't you know that before you serve it!?!?  Taste, taste, taste your food, chefs) and it was WAY too much.  I mean, I had enough kale leftovers to satisfy my vegetable requirement for a week.  It was a nightmare I tell you, and since I didn't finish it that night and had no fridge, it made for yummy, i mean yucky, smelling leftovers the next morning when i woke up from an alcohol-induced coma.  So wrong in so many ways.  After these mishaps it was all i could do to get out of this place, no dessert needed.  I don't care what you other yelpers say, this place will never ever see me again.  Period.  I had a much better steak at Brand in Monte Carlo or even at the Outback in front of Casino Royale.  Seriously.  I too, feel like an idiot for being excited to eat here.  I figured the way Tom is always harping on other chefs about taste, his shit would be on point, excuse my language.  I guess the portions are large and you will definitely have leftovers - likely because it was too nasty to finish the first time - but I would save your money.  If you happen to be in MGM I'd go for L'Atelier definitely over Craftsteak.  Next time I go there, I will be walking past this joint, with not a second glance, and heading straight to SeaBlue or Shibuya.",

    "text": "Meh. Overpriced, nothing special.  My husband and I ate here on our anniversay. We ordered the wagyu ribeye, t-bone, scalloped potatoes, asparagus and risotto. We did not receive the wagyu, but a standard ribeye.  The ribeye was nothing special. It was good, but hard to justify the price.  My husband's t-bone wasn't any better than the $9.99 special you can get from numerous casinos around town. The asparagus and potatoes were okay, but again, nothing special and overpriced. The risotto was a mistake! Not only was it covered in mushrooms (not in the description), it didn't \"spread\" on the plate...Instead, it was gummy.  I've watched Top Chef numerous times and Tom Colicchio ALWAYS complains about risotto that doesn't spread! Though he did not cook it for us, his name is attached to this restaurant.  Overal, the food was okay, but the price was too high. If you want better steak, head to Vic & Anthony's in the Golden Nugget. The steaks are similar in price, but MUCH better and the sides are more reasonably priced...and tastier.",

    "text": "We decided to visit this place for a friend's birthday last weekend.  The dim lights make everyone look years younger which could be a positive experience...   The food was ok.  I would rate this place 3.5 stars if it was an option...  Based on the recommendations of our sever, I ordered Lobster Bisque to start, Braised short ribs for the main, mushroom risotto, and asparagus for the sides.  The lobster bisque was delicious with tons of flavor.   Braised short ribs was extremely tender which compensated for the salty lackluster flavor.  Mushroom risotto and asparagus were pretty good.  I believe I enjoyed the sides more than the main course.    The food took about 45 minutes to come to our table.  Assistant Servers were extremely attentive coming around with water whenever a glass was half full.  Servers and Managers were friendly; however, the whole dining experience for a party of seven took almost three hours.  (Seated by 8:45, Got our check at 11:30)  If you are trying to get into a club... this may be a problem...    I was a little frustrated that our check took 50 minutes to get to our table, after asking for it.  It definitely was pretty busy friday night, but 50 minutes?  When I spend 100 dollars for a meal, I go for the experience.  This near three hour experience was frustrating for our whole group.  Everyone was frustrated and wanted to move on to our next agenda.    If you plan on going to this place, I am hoping that your dining experience does not end up like ours.  If you are willing to spend around $100 per head for food that is ok, then you may want to give this place a try.  I do not plan on going back...",

    "text": "As much as I hate to glorify expensive meals, I think Craftsteak deserves a lot of praise. Compared to other steakhouses in Vegas (e.g. SW, Cut) this place really does hold its ground! Yes, I did spend about $600 for two (W/O including alcohol) at the MGM Grand of all places, LOL. But let me tell you, Craftsteak is very special at any price.   To start, there was just the two of us. We both ordered the 3 course 'A5' Japanese Wagyu and shared a side of potato puree, mushrooms, and asparagus. It was definitely A LOT of food! ... And I should mention that although we ordered separately, we decided to share and eat family style since we both want the rib-eye and the strip (more on this later.) --- Appetizer + Wagyu beef tartare + Braised artichokes  + Grilled quail      The artichokes and quail were okay. But the tartare was very good. It was topped with a raw quail egg and you get chips to eat it with. I've had tuna tartare and beef carpaccio before, but not beef tartare. It was definitely a treat. --- Entree + 'A5' Wagyu Ribeye + 'A5' Wagyu Strip   AMAZING on every level. By virtue of it being genuine kobe beef, I would say that 75% of the work was already done for them. But considering the delicate nature of this meat, I think the chefs did a masterful job in their preparation. The meat was cooked to perfection and I love how they use rosemary on their skillet presentation. Quite honestly, it was very difficult to differentiate between the ribeye and the strip because both were extremely, EXTREMELY rich in texture, taste, and.. oh soo tender. They were also very generous with their cuts. I never really checked how much we were supposed to get, but I think both the ribeye and the strip was 10 oz ea.? Trust me, for kobe beef that's A LOT!! And on a separate note, maybe because we decided to share our meals, but the steaks were pre-cut for us.   Sides + Potato Puree + Mushrooms + Asparagus  Mushrooms and asparagus were okay. But the potato puree was REALLY good! I don't really know how to explain it.. it's like mashed potatoes in a miniature cast-iron kettle.. it's very delicate, tasty, and soft?  --- Dessert  + I don't really care too much for dessert, but we got 2 cakes and a sherbet. It was good. But I was already stuffed.. so I didn't take more than 2 small bites of each.  + Their french pressed coffee was really good though. I should have asked what kind of beans they used.. --- Drinks + We had a glass of wine that the server recommended.. it was good, but I have an untrained palette for wine, so I wouldn't know any better + Their flavored martinis were good --- Decor: Contemporary, warm, inviting.. without the over-the-top glitz and glamor associated with Vegas fine dining (e.g. Joel Robuchon.) And surprisingly casual?  Service: Was excellent! Our server was really, REALLY good. But then again, I think we were one of the easier patrons to serve that night..  Overall, I think Collichio did a marvelous job with this one. If you're looking for a fancy steak house, this is THE place to go in Vegas. I know there's a lot of options out there, and the location at the MGM is a little far from the center of the Strip, but I think it's worth it; especially if you're planning on watching KA or an event at the Grand Arena.",

    "text": "Somewhat Disappointing and Expensive  What is a \"celebrity\" or \"superstar\" chef?  Let's be realistic for a moment - there are some outstanding little known chefs out there that do not appear regularly on Food Network or Bravo that are far more deserving of accolades than some of the celebrity chefs that will earn 2 of the 5 stars on a review simply because of False expectations associated with a recognized  name.   Craftsteak at the MGM Grand is a wonderful restaurant. The service is impeccable, the decor nothing short of stunning, and you will, without a doubt have a fine meal here - so long as you are willing to pay the price, and a hefty price it is. The real question is if it's really worth it. Regretfully, my answer is - depends what you're looking for.   Craftsteak barely misses the mark in my book; expect to pay more than double what you would at other equally good venues. If we bring the total picture into play, not just food, then our measuring stick has to change and I would give the place 4 stars instead of three. For me, I prefer a beautiful, friendly atmosphere and great food over museum-quality surroundings and average to good food. This review is actually a comparison/contrast and hopefully will give you a good idea what to expect.   Our table of three at Craftsteak enjoyed a few drinks then started off with wagyu tartare. It was nothing short of outstanding  - and an extremely large portion! I was expecting 2-3 oz but received what appeared to be more than 1/2 a pound of pure delight. It was opulent. Had I known, I would have ordered it for dinner and called it a night. The three of us actually struggled to finish it - it is very heavy.   On to the steaks. We decided on a 32oz  rib for two and a 16 oz New York strip. As sides, we ordered the mushroom assortment which included somewhat rare hen of the woods which is a delight in an of itself, and sauteed Brussels sprouts.   Complaints... well, I must say the steaks lacked seasoning. Sorry, Chef/Owner Colicchio, it was close but no cigar.  A great steak should need little more than some fresh cracked pepper and salt, our two steaks felt devoid of either. To add insult to injury, the rib was excessively fatty with a rather large grain of connective tissue running through the dead center. This had to be a mistake. The knives provided were surprisingly dull (security issue?) and we had a hell of a time carving through this sucker.  If not for the great company, I was seriously considering sending it back.   We packed up some of the dinner rolls and the remaining steak to make late night sandwiches in our suite that evening- we were feeling like beached whales after the tartare. The check arrived and I handed over $375 to our waiter. Ouch. Double Ouch. I shudder to think what the bill would have been if we ordered deserts and coffee.  Lets move ahead 24 hours to a little Irish joint called the \"Nine Fine Irishmen\" at the New York, New York, right over the connecting bridge from the MGM Grand.  It's a bit loud, but bristling with a friendly, not raucous, energy and live music that was just loud enough that you could still very easily have a conversation. This time it was just myself and my wife. We sat at the deep marble bar (we didn't feel like waiting an hour for a table) and ordered two of the Guinness 250 limited edition stouts. Really yummy (if you like stout).   We shared a bowl of their colcannon soup which is a hearty blend of leeks, potato and irish bacon. They offered it to us with fresh soda bread and European butter with a herbs. I was simply in heaven. I considered licking the bowl, but there were too many people, including my wife, watching.  It was at this point that I started feeling bitter about Craftsteak. My 16 oz NY strip arrived (round two) and horseradish crusted halibut. Perfection! I was enjoying a great beer with a simply phenomenal steak that was cooked to perfection. The halibut was flaky and succulent in every way. Here's the best part - our bill was $64.. Sixty Four dollars compared to what we spent at Craftsteak! ($375). There simply was no comparison. As much as I think Gordon Ramsay is a pompous ass, (and I have eaten at  his restaurant London), there is something to be said for his philosophy of great, simple food. Craftsteak is good, but with the exception of the tartare, does not blow-me-away. They are missing the mark just a bit by trying to be an over the top. You are paying mostly for a name and a very posh atmosphere.   Considering the price and the quality of food, Nine Fine Irishmen was the winner for me. Granted, it's not a somber, fine dining experience, but I enjoy eating out to have a good time and a good meal, not just gawk at the decor and whisper in the amber glow of a restaurant that is bucking for a michelin star.",

    "text": "My fiance and I ate at Craftsteak 2 nights ago after years of putting it off.  It was WELL worth the wait. Initially we were just going to each get our own main dish and split a side. On a whim, we decided to go the Chefs Selection route with Domestic Wagyu. So this is what all we got with that: each had lobster bisque (very very good), Caesar salad (good), heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella that was probably made 5 minutes prior to being served. After all that, we were into the main course! The steaks were orders medium rare and came out PERFECTLY cooked. We were served a NY steak (it was presented as a rib eye, but I know my steaks) and a filet. The NY steak was awesome, but the filet was something special. Easily the most tender AND flavorful steak of my life.....by a long shot. Now for the sides. We got their roasted corn (amazing), whipped potatoes (extremely creamy) and the mushroom medley. As a diehard mushroom lover, I was severely let down by this side. So after stuffing ourselves with all of that.....onto dessert! Did we split one dessert?? No. Did we get two desserts?? Nope! We were served THREE desserts...and all were great. We got their monkey bread which was very warm and fresh. Next we had their panacotta (sp) with strawberry sorbet.....absolutely great! And then we got a basil sorbet ( just go with it....sounds weird, but VERY refreshing!!) and smores ice cream. Here is the best part. We added up our meal had we purchased everything al a carte (including drinks), the meal came to $400 BEFORE tax and tip. However because we did the \"Chef Selection\" our bill was $410 AFTER tax and tip.....saved roughly $80!! It may be a while before my wallet recovers and I'm able to return to Craftsteak, but you bet your rear end I'll be recommending the hell out of the place until then!!!",

I ordered the Filet and ended up splitting it with a friend as it was huge, 12 ounces.  That was the smallest Filet they had.  We also got the caesar salad which was pretty good, and the risotto that was phenomenal.  I'm Italian so I'm usually weary about ordering risotto out, because so few restaurants can make it correctly, but craftsteak got this one right.   After sharing an entree, side, appetizer, and dessert with my friend, our bills were about $60 each.  It was plenty of food, and reasonably priced for what you're getting.  We got the ice cream for dessert, pistachio and apple pie.  It was so creamy and delicious, and the apple pie ice cream really tasted like apple pie.  It even had chunks of apple it in.  Amazing.

There were four in our party and started with Kobe beef tartare which was delicious as always. For entrees we had skirt steak, bone in ribeye and free range chicken, all delicious. For sides, sauteed spinach (just okay), potato puree, hen of the woods mushrooms and white corn grits. Very disappointed in the grits as they tasted like liquid smoke!! I like a smokey flavor but this was bad. We also had a very nice Merlot blend and this where things took a turn. As we all finished our wine, every single one of us ended up with a mouthful of sediment. Not just a little, I'm talking full on globs of it. Not only did it end up in our mouths, it was still clinging heavily to the glasses. There were several unused decanters right behind our table. We brought it to the attention of our waiter who made the mgr aware. Quite honestly, he was kind of an ass and came off as pompous and made us feel like either we shouldn't have been bothered by the sediment or were not savvy enough to understand wine. Um, not my first bottle bub. He did apologize and asked if we were going to have dessert, but it was almost as a check the box kind of thing.  We were too full for dessert and with that, he moved on very quickly.  I don't expect perfection, but do kind of expect a good overall experience and to be treated kindly when dropping nearly $700 for a meal.",

The ambiance was very simplistic, not extravagant, but at the same time very elegant. Our service was excellent as well; the server was helpful with picking out a wine (I think the cheapest wine on the menu was about $44 so be prepared to spend some $$ if you plan on drinking).   The food itself was fantastic. My only complaint was that our server did not make it clear whatsoever that the portions are family style. If you are ordering a side dish, it's definitely enough for two or three people. For instance, she asked me if I wanted to start with a salad. I ordered the frisee salad with bacon and blue cheese (which was amazing). She then proceeded to ask my grandma if she wanted a salad as well. Luckily, she declined and when the salad came, it was a dinner sized portion. We split the salad and there was still a lot left over.   For the main course we both ordered New York steaks and I ordered a side of asparagus, and my grandma ordered the side of pureed Yukon gold potatoes. Everything was delicious, however, we had tons of leftovers. If I were to do it all over, we would have just ordered one steak since the portions were very generous.   Overall, it was a great experience. The service was good, the food was fantastic, I am glad we finally made it out here.",

I was pleased, although not blown away, by my visit to Crafsteak in the MGM Grand in Vegas.  It's an attractive space, done up mostly in browns, with a high ceiling and carpet that does a good job of muffling sound without stifling all noise. Smooth jazz was on the sound system, though -- ugh! What a misstep. Classic jazz would be great in this setting, but not Kenny G.-esque blah. Service was okay, not stellar, not horrible.  The menu is long and suffers from a bit too much brevity; none of the items were accompanied by descriptions (in contrast to San Francisco restaurants' sometimes overly wordy menus). Lots to choose from, and we had to ask our waiter to describe several dishes to us. To start, we ordered a Caesar (fine, nothing special) and a Persian cucumber dressed in a vinaigrette (crisp and refreshing), accompanied by watercress (too bitter for me). We shared a New York strip steak, cooked medium rare, for our main course, and it was absolutely out of this world. Tender, perfectly seasoned, deep and rich. Yum. The side of romano beans was comparatively boring but was good for what it was. Dessert of chocolate hazelnut  molten cake was fine.  So, a mixed bag. Steak, yes! Other stuff, 's okay. Kinda pricey.",

I had the Farmer Jones' mixed lettuces (dark, bitter lettuce - the caesar salad looked as if it would have been a better choice for me), the surf & turf with fillet mignon and scallops (perfection), shared sides of Yukon gold puree (silky smooth - I could eat it for the rest of my life) and asparagus with my cousin, the chocolate souffle (fatty) and two apple martinis. It was simply the perfect meal to start an unforgettable evening.    HIGHLY recommended.",

We ordered three different steaks and sides so we could get a good sample.  Out of the three steaks, only the Ribeye is something I would have applauded, and it's pretty hard to mess up a Ribeye.  I hate to say it but I've had better steak at Outback Steakhouse.  With all that said I would have given this place a solid three stars, but it was the service that took it down one more.  Three steaks, three sides, a bottle of wine, a check that was over $400 and we were pretty much ignored by the waitstaff.  Patty at Denny's down the street had better customer service.  I hate to say it but I can't see myself trying this place again, nor would I recommend it if someone asked \"I'm going to Vegas, where should we eat?\"  Sorry Tom.",

We were in Vegas for New Year's celebration (a tradition) and wanted to eat at a nice place.  We were late at making reservations at any of the nice places, but Craftsteak said if we came at opening (5 pm) they could seat us right away.  I am soooooooo happy we ended up there that night.  The experience was every positive and heavenly descriptive word possible.  We all participated in the chef's tasting menu--uber expensive but well worth it.  There was a plethora of meats (beef, pig, poultry, etc) and side dishes (spinach, mushrooms, onions, etc), appetizers, and desserts.  By the end, we were stuffed to the gills, but omg, really, it was aaaaaaaaawesome.  The second time I went, we got the kobe tasting menu--YUUUUUUM!!!!  Definitely more rich and filling, but again, you will die for it.    The service is excellent, and I always love to see the servers inspecting and wiping the stemware to make sure it is spic and span clean--it means they are serious about this restaurant stuff.  I also appreciate that they treat you well.  I hate fancy restaurants where the servers are snooty, just because it is a fancy restaurant.  So a little while later, Top Chef premieres and we find out that the head judge Tom Colicchio is also the head honcho at Craftsteak, which only solidified both my love for the restaurant and Tom himself.  If you're looking for fantastic food and a great experience, come to Craftsteak, you will not be disappointed.",

We had the Kobe beef, filet mignon, some other cut i cant remember, and lobster. So much food for three male individuals that we didn't even finish. The wild mushrooms were my favorite!  Remember to save room for the desserts.   Service was excellent. While my vendor was walking back from the restroom, he was checking out maitre'd and ran into a tables bottle of wine. Completely his fault. But a few minutes later, we were served a free bottle of dessert wine for the trouble!",

For appetizers, the warm frisee salad was excellent although too big for one person.  My wife had the foie gras and devoured it in a hurry.    Most of us got the filet mignon entrees and one got the short ribs.  I love a great filet and wasn't disappointed, but the short ribs were out of this world.  So delicious it makes you never want to even attempt to cook something like it yourself.  The risotto was also a great addition to the meal.  The only disappointment--I was hoping they had some unusual ice cream flavors like the Craft in LA.  The maple bacon ice cream there was an amazing finish to a great meal.  Here, they had the basics.  Still great though!  I'll be back some time!",

Though the five course (or so) meal was overall great, the best parts of the meal were the fennel salad and the skirt steak.   The fennel salad had the clean taste that typifies New American cuisine. We cleaned the plate like vultures. The skirt steak was cooked to perfection and cut with delicacy. It was a little saucy and a tad bit salty at the ends, but I did wish for a bigger stomach that night so I could fit more of the steak into my stomach.   The atmosphere is nice, but very dark... you've been warned. The service is amazing and if you have the cash to burn -- I'd highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Now I'm just showing off.   Almost every fine-dining restaurant I passed in Vegas featured a \"summer\" (read: recession) special, usually in the form of a fixed price menu. Craftsteak's did not disappoint. $60 per person (pre-tax/wine) gets you not one selection from every course but a family-style meal where every single item on the special menu is served during each course.   Here were the standouts:   Course 0: Um...the bread is glazed with butter and covered in sea salt. Even my annoyingly health-conscious dining companion who doesn't eat butter or carbs ate butter and carbs.   Course 1: I rarely exclaim aloud at good food anymore, but the quail got an \"oh wow\" from this relatively jaded foodie. This was the best course in my opinion- the cucumber salad and the fennel salad were both excellent and my friend puts his vote in for the fresh mozzarella.   Course 2: Oh diver scallops, I'd eat you for the rest of my life if I could. No, really. The two other dishes, both steak, were solid if unremarkable. Cooked to my instruction on the rare side, which I appreciated.   Course 2b: Um, there were sides? The corn salad was good, but I could not fathom eating any more at this point. My friend gladly ate all the mushrooms, so I infer his recommendation.   Course 3: Sigh, is anything more disappointing than digging into what you think is a blueberry crisp only to find that it is rhubarb? I'm not a fan of rhubarb solo (look, it's like putting celery with sugar into a pie!), but the crisp itself was nice and topped with a wonderful homemade vanilla. The other dessert was a chocolate cake and a chocolate mousse covered in solid. dark chocolate.   A wonderful glass of malbec ($13) helped the meal (and bill) go down nicely.   Wonderful service, wonderful food, wonderful deal. If you're in Vegas soon, check to see if that restaurant you've been eying has become slightly more affordable.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for Christmas this year and did our Christmas evening dinner at Craftsteak.  After a martini to start, we went for the wagyu surf and turf for two.  It started with the hot rolls which were excellent.  Followed by buffalo mozzarella with roasted red peppers, a spinach salad, the wagyu tartare which was divine, and they were kind enough to sub six Olde Salt oysters for the prawns.    Next came our bottle of wine and the main course of a wagyu skirt steak that was overcooked with way too much sauce on it, a perfectly cooked and melt-in-your-mouth delicious ribeye, and what appeared to be almost a full lobster in a wonderful taragon butter sauce.  Along with the meat came three side dishes......brussel sprouts with smoked bacon.  Hated those.  Never liked them as a kid and still don't.  I don't care how much bacon you cook them with they still taste bad.  I wish I would have known that was going to be an option and I would have insisted against them.  The potato puree was wonderful and the assorted mushrooms were alright. But with as much food as was on the table ti didn't bother me a bit that I only really liked one of the sides.  When they said they'd bring a desert sampling I had no idea we were in for 3 plates of desert.  Vanilla bean cheesecake, a sorbet sampler, and a plate of monkey bread with cinnamon ice cream that was heavenly.  We also had a bottle of wine with dinner, followed by a Macallan scotch flight that we shared and two cups of coffee.  We almost had to be rolled out of there.    The good: --Most of the food was excellent --The atmosphere was classy without being stuffy --The waiters were top notch and handled everything perfectly --The blues music was a nice touch  The bad: --I hate these restaurants that put tables against a bench and the other side gets chairs.  This is not Dennys!  For this kind of $$ I want my own table and a little privacy.  We could clearly hear the conversations at the tables on either side of us.  It was very annoying. --The price........holy cow Batman!  $640 after the tip.  For two people.  I freely admit that it was a LOT of food.  But $640?  Maybe if it was hand prepared by Tom Coicchio himself.  But it wasn't.  It was good but it wasn't that good!  If they cut their prices by a quarter to a third, I would have been very happy.  If we decide to go back we'll bypass the tasting menu and order a la carte.",

Good thing we took it to go (and we did only to have it locked in our room's fridge, blah).    The dessert was a series of sorbettos and a few other things actually.  It was a lot of dessert.

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place more. But after being packed into the restaurant like sardines and ordering what can only be described as obscenely priced steaks, I had to reconsider.  First off, this place is BUSY. I guess the famous name helps. But in all seriousness, I love my steaks. The thought of a juicy wagyu steak was like a foodgasm and the wait was worth it.  We thought about doing the tasting menu, but for two people, that seemed like a ridiculous amount of food. After observing those around us who did partake, it indeed was the right decision.   We settled on sharing the substantially sized wagyu ribeye ($105) and the kale/bacon side to accompany. The steak came to the table presliced medium rare with a reduction sauce on top to pair.   Without question, the quality of meat was exceptional. It literally melts in your mouth. Chewing, while civilized, is not necessary. The flavor was... disappointing. Given previous experiences with wagyu and especially with the price tag associated, I expected a symphony of taste. Instead, it was a 3-piece orchestra. To be fair, it was a damn good 3-piece orchestra.   When observing the cost-taste analysis, I think I would've rather had 2 regular ribeyes. That's really the reason for the 3 stars. Now if I were eating dinner on the company dime, 5 stars, no question. But alas, paying for the meal with my own hard earned money - the whole experience has to be taken into consideration.",

We were staying the the MGM Grand for one of my SO's yearly conventions and coincidentally our friends were staying there too (but they were staying in the Mansion).  My SO had the Kobe fillet mignon and I had the Kobe flat iron steak.  Both were terrific but my steak had a lot more flavor than the fillet, although the fillet was more tender.  We also had a couple bottles of Harlan Estate Cab and some fantastic port.  The food and wine were incredible.    The casino was picking up the bill (thanks to our friend's and their love of gambling) so we gladly paid the gratuity which was ONLY $400.",

    "text": "It's pretty solid.  However, I'd say it's running 3rd or 4th place behind Stripsteak, N9NE and Cut in terms of steakhouses in Vegas.  Everything here is very elementary and pedestrian.  Almost every dish is served by itself, cooked with either olive oil, butter and/or a dash of lemon, that's it.  For example, the prosciutto appetizer is just that-prosciutto on a plate.  The mixed baby greens are just that-mixed baby greens with a vinagrette.  The steaks come a la carte, and nothing is made with any creativity whatsoever.  However, I will say that our charcuterie plate was pretty damn tasty.  The fresh baked bread rolls that everyone seems to be raving about on here were BORING, however.  You guys need to raise your bread standards.  Our meal wasn't bad by any means, but I guess I need a little more pizazz to really impress.  The carrot side dish was good, and my steak was pretty decent, but again...it just didn't compare to Stripsteak.  It was a bit season-less.  I won't put up a stink if someone wants to go there again in the future, but it's not going to be a top choice of mine.  OH- and none of the steak is hormone/antibiotic free, sustainable or organic.  FYI.",

At the table, it takes them a while to come back for your order, to get you bread, to even come back to ask how things are going.    As for the food quality.  The steaks are good, I've had the Hanger, the Skirt, the Rib-eye, and the waygu style ribeye.  All cooked well, not the temp, but well as in cooked decently.  But nothing memorable.   I can remember the first time I had a Ruth Chris steak with it's butter topping sizzling on it, it tasted great.  Or at Delmonico's where there was this superb crust on their ribeye that I can still taste and dream that all future steaks I eat will be like that.    As it stands, at over $100 a person, both times we've been there.  I've had better experiences at other steak houses for that price. Side note, the Craftsteak in Los Angeles was a better experience.",

It made me actually think about other places I gave 5 stars to, in order to down-grade them.  Everything here was absolutely amazing: service, food, wine, ambiance, and value.  This was another one of those restaurants that I had very high expectations for.  I mean, Tom Colicchio is like a God to me.  I'm a huge Top Chef fan... since the very first season... so this was a must-visit restaurant for me on my trip to Vegas.  Not only did he meet my high expectations, but they were completely blown out of the water.  Our server was so great... she was very knowledgeable about the food and wine, and was great about keeping our waters and bread plate full.  Towards the end of the meal, when we realized how late we were running, she brought our check with the desserts and was so prompt that we were able to make our VIP table reservation at Studio 54.  I absolutely loved the ambiance here.  Very manly... dark wood and leather.  So gorgeous and classy, but also laid back and easy.  I thought the fact that the bread and steaks were served on cast-iron skillets, fit in perfectly.  And the bread was amazing: white dinner rolls with a salted crust on top.  Now to the food... oh, the food.  I saw something about a summer tasting menu online beforehand, so I asked the waitress about it.  She said that they only do that during the week... but moments later she returned and said that it would be fine.  My girlfriends and I decided that at $60/person, it was a great idea.  One of my friends and I added the wine pairing for around $15, which was amazing... the 3 glasses of wine went perfectly with each course.  For our first course we had:   Shaved Fennel Salad Grilled Quail, Vincotto Buffalo Mozzarella with Red Pepper Caponata Persian Cucumber Salad  Now this was my first time tasting fennel and quail, and it was a great one!  Everything was amazing, and there was so much food for us 4 girls to eat!  For our main course we had: Prime Beef Flat Iron Angus Skirt Steak Diver Sea Scallops  I'm not a seafood fan, so I only had the steaks for this course.  Both of them were the BEST steaks I have EVER had.  Both perfectly cooked to medium... juicy, and delicious flavor.  They gave us 1 big flat iron steak, and 2 big skirt steaks.  We had so much food, that there were leftovers of the steak (which I was not too happy about, but so stuffed I couldn't eat another bite!).  For the side dishes we had: Yukon Gold Potato Puree Sauteed Snap Peas Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms  I had the potato puree' and snap peas, because I despise mushrooms... but both of those were delicious.  Not over-spiced... just simple and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Great compliment to the delicious flavorful steaks.  I liked that the side dishes didn't overpower the star of the meal: the steak.  For dessert, we had 4 different delectable plates.  I don't completely remember what they were, and our menu just said \"Chef's Selection\".  A couple of them were better then the rest, but they all were enjoyable.  Again, way too much food for us 4 girls.    This was definitely one of the best dining experiences of my life, so far.  The food was divine and each course perfectly cooked.  Plus, the chef tasting menu was a great value and huge variety... so I recommend that to anyone trying this restaurant for a first time!",

Craftsteak is one of my favorite steak joints in the US, even in spite of the fact that it's in Vegas.   I split the 4\" thick porterhouse with a friend, and found the filet to be the less desirable half of the side-of-beef-sized slab in front of me.  Not that it wasn't good, but the strip was unbelievable.  I regret ordering the fries, but the mashed potatoes (plain, no garlic, thank you) more than made up for it.    This was also the dinner where I called LAX to tell them we wouldn't be making it over for the AVN pre-party and that they could give away my table.  I was clearly adversely affected by the Justin Isosceles we put away.",

    "text": "After careful thought and debate, I chose to make my reservation at craftsteak....and boy am I glad I did!  Located at the MGM Grand, valeting the car was a cinch.  The downside was we had no idea where the place was on the gigantor casino floor.  Sign after sign, craftsteak was no where in sight.  I finally got BF to ask someone where the place was.  Lone and behold, the \"Studio Walk\" was around the corner from where we entered (near the monorail).  This is definitely NOT a frou frou place.  You feel at home here.  The dress code varies from person to person, flip flop to flip flop and sport coat to sport coat.  The dining area was dimly lit and beautifully decorated.    The service was awesome.  Our water glass was never left empty.  And the waitstaff was very attentive and always available.  We decided on the wagyu tasting menu, 3 courses for $130 pp:  Starters: Mixed greens Roasted Red Peppers - very tasty Diver Sea Scallops - super WOW! Prosciutto - another WOW!  Main Course: Kobe beef rib eye - tender and very flavorful Kobe beef flat iron - BF's fav  Sides: Yukon gold potatoes - this didn't sound like anything special, but WOW creamy goodness! Asparagus Mixed Mushrooms - just ok  Dessert: Monkey Bread - OMG! Assorted ice cream and sorbets Molten choc lava cake Strawberries and black berries  This was A LOT of food!  Everything was excellent.  The 2 hour dining experience is the best I've had.  This is also the most money we've spent for dinner.  Our bill came out to almost $400!  But, well worth it!  Make your reservations online or by phone and keep that confirmation number they give you...otherwise you will be screwed out of the BEST meal ever!",

At first glance, the Chef's tasting menu may seem overpriced but after we heard what it entailed? It was a no brainer.. with 8 guys, we all chose the tasting menu which allowed us the Wagyu Beef with every type of cut there was... served family style... the starters were dishes of prosicutto, ceasar salad, buffalo cheese, asparagus, and some other excellent appetizers...  The main course was came out in sizzling metal trays... the steaks nice sliced up to be shared amongst the party. Ribeye, Filet, New York, Flank Strip...These steaks melted in your mouth.  Most of us voted the Ribeye as the best and most flavorful cut of beef that night.  So if you really have to choose? Choose the ribeye!!!   Lastly, we wrapped up with a slew of dessert to meet anyone's palette.  from Cucumber ice cream, Cheesecakes, to the unforgettable Monkey Bread.  Everything was so fresh.  This IS the BEST meal I've ever had to date... It was an immediate 5 stars ... I'm a big time foodie and i'm saying this is the best meal ever!",

But being a fan of Top Chef, I figured I gotta see what's up w/ Colicchio (sp?).  Luckily we were there for Restaurant Week so we did their special menu that came with a bunch of sides and 3 different cuts of steak.  We also ordered their yukon gold puree w/ truffle oil.  Can't go wrong with that - 2 of my favs yukon gold & truffle oil in one dish?!  More please!  :)  Everything was good, including the steak.  I guess I was expecting GREAT steak and so was a little disappointed.  I must say the portions were good and everything was definitely worth the price (mind you, it was a discounted price for restaurant week).  Other than the puree, nothing exceptionally special.  I'd go back, but it's not at the top of my list for Vegas.",

    "text": "Worth every penny.  Hands down, this was the best meal of my life.   I can't tell you what I ate for breakfast this morning, but I ate here over two weeks ago, and I can still remember every detail of every dish of every course.    My friend and I got the tasting menu, and, although it is an obscene amount of food for two people, I highly recommend it because you get to try so many different dishes.  You just have to practice the art of self-restraint so that you save room for the monkey bread.   Of the four (yes, 4!) appetizers that they brought us, the best were the grilled spot prawns, with the heads still on.  You just pop those eyes off and bite into buttery bliss.    For the main course, we got two different steaks -- filet mignon and the ribeye.  Never in my life have I eaten such deliciousness.  I didn't know that food of any kind could taste this divine.  The meat literally melted in my mouth.  I don't know who cooked my steak that evening, but I would have married him in the MGM chapel that very night.    And then there were the mushrooms -- hen of the woods and other exotic varieties.  Good god.  They were firm, yet soft and seasoned to perfection.  The ideal complement to the steak.    Now, mind you, I had NO room for dessert.  None.  But, luckily, I have a separate dessert stomach that had just enough room.  Again, they brought out *4* desserts.  Ridiculous.  I won't bother to describe the other 3 desserts because the monkey bread stole the show.  It sat right there next to the molten chocolate cake, which, on any other day, would have been my preference.  But, this monkey bread was better than chocolate.  Blasphemy, I know.   Each monkey ball is rolled in butter and sugar, and soaks up all the flavors -- it's like every bite is that best first bite of the cinnamon roll.    The service was impeccable, the kind where you don't even notice they're there, yet everything is taken care of for you.    Put Craftsteak on your list of \"things I must experience before I die\" right there next to bungee jumping and seeing the Parthenon.",

The Chef's Beef Selection menu is a 3 course meal with a min of 2 people ordering. You get an appetizer, steak, side, & desert. The diver sea scallops were cooked to perfection with a crispy out side and tender inside that melted in your mouth. The Pork belly, Caesar, Cucumber, Heirloom tomatoes salads were all well prepared and was fresh and tasty. The shrimp cocktail was ok but no wows there. Oysters were fresh and sweet and lobster bisque was as good as it gets (these two were additional orders not part of the Chef's Selection). The Japanese A5 Waygu was by far the best with all the flavors of a New York but melted in your mouth. 2nd place was a the skirt, yes the skirt steak. It had tons of flavor and yet super tender. The rest were also awesome but those two was just... Wow! Deserts were all good (check my pics). Must try place!",

Each course came with 3-4 different items, each better than the one before. With only two of us eating all of this food, it was one hell of a heavenly chore.  Standout parts of the tasting menu were the beet salad, the wild mushrooms, and both kobe dishes. my dining parter sure seemed to enjoy the chocolate dessert at the end as well, but since I'm not much of a chocolate fan, I stuck with the decadent berry cobbler and sorbets.  I will definitely be going back to Craftsteak. Nice job, Tom!",

When we showed up, the staff of course did not have a table for us since the people who'd likely were sitting down while we were making our reservation had not finished eating.  Thanks to Jim (and sorry for the incessant complaints), we were seated at 9:15, ready to order, and scarf our meal down but soon realized upon our food's arrival (our table of 7 ordered everything from the diver scallops, to the filet, to the salmon, lamb, short ribs, sweet corn, asparagus, and au gratin) that we were being served culinary genius and that we should relax and enjoy our meal.  We ended up missing our calling at Cosmo but did not mind too much because we were full of delicious food and had thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Craftsteak.  Definite recommend!",

This past weekend I had to talk around in circles for 4 minutes about getting a steak the way I want to eat it.  I was told they don't taste good cooked that way.  Try the ribs instead.  If I wanted ribs why do you think I came to a steak house ? The steak came out so bloody they didn't even put it on the table and was send back to be made medium well.  It came back butchered by the chief into 10 small pieces.  Well thank you I'm a little kid can you cut up my steak for me ????  They offered up a free side dish comped my $12 beer to make up for it and hovered over our table for a long time to make sure everything was alright.  A little on the creepy side.   Tom what up!!!????",

I've been to many  steakhouses in Las Vegas and other major metropolitan areas and can tell you for your money you will get a much better meal if you do not go to this restaurant.  I think they just rely on tourists that just go there once and never go back again as it's very clear their business is not brisk.   Go to SW Steakhouse, or Mastro's, they may be slightly more expensive but you  will leave having an experience.  This place is one step above Outback Steak House",

We got seated at a booth, which was nice since it was more intimate and private. Our server, Randall, came by after about 5 minutes and took our order. I had the dry-aged NY steak and their Persian Cucumber Salad. My mister order their dry-aged ribeye with a side of their sweet corn. I also ordered their Blue Lemonade cocktail.   Cocktail and bread came within a few minutes. I ordered a Blue Lemonade, thinking it would be blue but apparently it was only blueberries, which actually wasn't even stated on the menu. Salad came shortly after that. As for the steaks... They took way too long! When it did finally come out, half my steak was too well done. I ordered medium and half of it was more well than medium. My NY Steak lacked flavor and was really tough. By far one of the worst steaks I've had at a steakhouse. The Ribeye was slightly better, just slightly. The best part was our corn, no lies.   Service was subpar. They checked up on us maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the meal. We finished our not so good steaks and asked for the bill so we could just leave.   $200 for a meal and our best part was the corn. Well, probably won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Best. Meal. Ever.   Seriously though, Craftsteak has far surpassed any other fine dining establishment that I have been to. From the service, to the drinks and food, everything was 5 stars all the way. Marvin and the rest of the team of servers gave great attention to our table. They helped us to select cocktails, wine, and scotch and thoroughly went over the menu with us.   We went into Craftsteak thinking that we'd each split a meat, side dish, and dessert with our significant other. However, Marvin changed our lives by introducing us to the Chef's Beef Selection. The Double R Beef tasting was right up our alley. We were able to enjoy bread, 4 appetizers, 4 meats, 4 side dishes, and 5 desserts for $125 per person. SOLD!   Our eyes widened and our mouths hit the floor as soon as the food began arriving at the table. Everything-- and I mean everything-- was perfectly cooked and delicious. I had to force myself to stop eating the Prosciutto appetizer so I would have room for the rest of the meal. The Filet was so tender, it melted in my mouth. I also enjoyed the grilled Rib Eye, very nice char and perfectly medium. The Risotto and White Corn Grits were so filling and comforting, I only wish we had a refrigerator in our room so I could enjoy it the next day.   Last, but certainly not least, the desserts. The moment I had been waiting for.  Who gets excited about desserts at an award winning steak place? This girl does! I perused the menu months ago and was immediately drawn to the Monkey Bread Pudding. This dessert gave me LIFE. Although we were beyond full from the entree course, we finished every last bite of all 5 desserts. Not to mention, I was \"In Love with the Coco\" with my Coconut cocktail.   Overall, I left this restaurant with one of the best dining experiences of my life. Looking forward to future visits!",

Prior experiences at Delmonico, Cut, and Striphouse far outshone this Colicchio outpost. I was disappointed that there really weren't any \"wow, we need to try that\" items on the menu. The roaming photographer seemed cheesy and cheap. The seats are very close together and we were seated next to some very loud groups. Fine dining it was not, despite a fleet of professional and attentive servers and their associated staff. My wine flight was not enjoyable but that's on me for choosing it. We shared a dry aged porterhouse. It was properly cooked to temp and was tender and beefy. Fine for the price. The Brussels sprouts were nothing to write home about. The grits were the highlight of the meal: smokey, just enough cheese, creamy. We allotted two hours but we're out in less than an hour and a half. The meal was pretty cheap compared to other steakhouses in Vegas, but you get what you pay for. If you're after a fine dining, old school steakhouse, even Oscar's downtown offers more of that ambiance. This isn't in the same class as the aforementioned other steakhouses on the strip. Truly, the steak was fine. It would have been a good lunch experience given the price, value and the lack of formality. But they're open for dinner only.",

At a fine dining restaurant: 1) there should not be any issues but if there are they should be handled discretely and professionally, 2) the diner should feel well taken care of, 3) the staff should not bad mouth the diner under their breath with the entire table hearing it, and 4) the staff should not openly badmouth the diner to other staff within earshot (this one is just idiotic).   This was my worst dining experience in Vegas. The general manger reassigned the offending waiter and fixed the issue by literally moving our table a couple of inches, which is what the original waiter should have done instead of continually bumping into one of our diners as he passed by with out an apology but rather a snooty remark that the diner should move aside to let him through. Ruined our experience - I would not recommend this place to others.",

    "text": "Sorry to give this review as I'm a huge Colicchio/Top Chef fan but based on the experience needed to do it.  Arrived earlier (5:30) because we had 7pm show tickets so restaurant was not busy at all.  After joking around with the 4 waiters (who visited our table early for water/bread etc) that we were anticipating best service ever....we got the opposite.  Wine list robust but virtually nothing by glass which Was irritating as we didn't want to drink a bottle in an hour.  It took almost 20 minutes to finally place our order, 45 to get appetizers, and then main course came out at the same time we had indicated we needed to leave.  So the dining experience suffered as a result.    As to food I was 100% positive we would not have an issue...been to Craft LA and food was phenomenal.  At MGM the lobster bisque was....well pedestrian with lobster tough.  Arugula salad was...well arugula dressed with trace amounts of pine nuts and thinly sliced cheese.  Oysters saved dinner as they were excellent!!!  The 16oz bone in NY strip (personal favorite) came out finally and I anticipated it would save experience...instead it fell short.  It was on the tough side and it appears they let it rest far to long as it was slightly cold as well.    I do understand Tom doesn't oversee restaurant and we did explain our service complaint to GM who visited table before we left but when you putting out hundreds of dollars for a meal at a restaurant who assumably holds high standards for itself, it ruins experience when the service is below average and the food resembles something you could find at any 3 Star restaurant in Vegas.",

We didn't have a reservation but were accommodated and were seated fairly soon. As you enter Craftsteak you are greeted by warm tones, dim lighting and beautiful wood furniture across the bar and extending into the dining room, the decor and ambiance screams steak house.  Okay, maybe it doesn't scream because this is a very nice place,  perhaps it just speaks in its inside voice ;)   Once seated the wait staff explained the menu and different options available.  They also asked if we had any time restrictions, show reservations etc... which I thought was very thoughtful.  You can order a la cart from the menu or you can opt for the chefs beef selection with is a flat per person price and is serves family style, it includes appetizer and dessert.  We opted for a la cart.  We ordered Cesar salads, I had the filet minion, my colleagues had the hangar steak and the flat iron steak,  for sides we ordered asparagus, mushrooms and mashed potatoes.  They are all served family style and very easy for sharing, which is great because you are going to want to try all of it.    Everything was cooked to perfection, the quality of the meat and veggies is superior.  Go with plenty of time, you are going to want to relax and enjoy every bite of this experience.  Yes it is very expensive and yes it is worth the money.  You will not be disappointing.",

Still working my way into the tax bracket that allows me to get a Japanese  wagyu, and when I get there I'm coming back to try theirs!  The other items I tried were the oysters (solid) and the fingerling potatoes (tasty.) Service was excellent and I was a big fan of the ambiance too. 5 stars",

    "text": "Looking at menus prior to making reservations anywhere, my husband and I want to go somewhere that has delicious food with surf n turf being a must. This was our first time dining at Craftsteak, and the experience all around blew our socks off! To start the cocktails were perfection! We arrived about 30 minutes before our reservation and decided to wait in the bar. We had some drinks and ordered a shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque (poured table side) is probably the best I have ever had. It wasn't overly fishy, it was creamy, the lobster was melting in my mouth. The bartender also set us up with bread in case we wanted to soak up our soup with it. Amazing! We liked that at the bar we were sitting next to each other, plus the bartender (I think his name was Rick) was very attentive without being overly intrusive, so we decided to stay there for our main course. The bartender let the hostess know and promptly began setting us up for dinner. My husband ordered the 40oz steak and I ordered the seafood trio. We had grits, asparagus and potato puree as our sides. The grits were creamy with smokiness from the cheese and bacon, just a dream to eat! The puree was smooth without being gummy or starchy, and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. The food came out and I about fell of my barstool it was so delicious. The bone marrow that came with the steak was a first try for me. It was like steak butter. Everything was seasoned and cooked so well with such beautiful presentation. Staff was outstanding and I felt like royalty dining there. The cost was more than worth the entire experience! It was no doubt the best meal I've ever had. My husband and I always splurge when we can get away just us, and have dined at many expensive steakhouses in our 15 years together. We will definitely return again. If I could give 10 stars I would!",

    "text": "If I could give it a 3.5 stars I'd do that instead.  For this trip to Vegas I decided to try out Craftsteak because of two things; 1) my buddy Henzel highly recommended it and, 2) Cherlynn N, a \"friend\" of mine through Yelp also gave it a 4.5 stars and not only do I love her reviews but our tastes are very similar when it comes to eateries.  I would have also started my review exactly the way Cherlynn N wrote her first paragraph about Craftsteak (except for the bf part) and Tom Colicchio on Top Chef.  Now let me break it down.  Atmosphere was excellent except for the cold air condition draft that was blowing direct to my gf.  Otherwise it was hip, good lighting, and the noise level was good where we could talk to each other without yelling across the table.  We decided to go with the pre fixe meal of $140 each for the wagyu beef selections.  This pre fix includes a cup each of their lobster bisque, 3 half orders of any of their salads, 3 half orders of any of their sides, 3 dessert.  Being the wagyu filet my lady decided to get was just $105 by itself, this pre fix deal is worth it!  The bread - 5 stars.  Let's say they were like freshly baked hawaiian bread but only lighter, brushed with butter on top and sprinkled with sea salt.  We would go back to Craftsteak just for this bread!  You get six pieces at the table.  We asked for another tray and also had an order to-go.  Ain't no shame to our game!  Lobster bisque - 3 stars.  I was so looking forward to this as it's knows as one of their signature dishes.  While it was tasty it was overly \"herbed\".  That blew it.  The bisque at Farallon in SF is much better.  Appetizers: Caesar salad, Roasted beet salad, Italian Buffalo Mozzarella.  The Caesar was very good.  It's not chopped romaine lettuce but served whole leaf.  The dressing is tasty and light.  I would order that again.  The beet salad was also very good.  Various different types of beets.  Another order again.  The mozzarella fell flat, not big deal.  Oh and we also ordered the seared scallops which were very tasty.  Two glasses of wine and we were ready for the 2nd half of the meal and that's where things actually went relatively downhill.  Sides: mushroom assortment, potato puree, spinach.  All three to me were really no big deal.  So not much to write about here.  Steaks:  As I said my lady had the wagyu filet while I decided to order the wagyu skirt, their most popular cut.  This is what I hated.  Both steaks came served to us ALREADY CUT INTO PIECES!!  This is like the cardinal rule of steak!  Pre-cut steak just lets all the juices out.  WTH?  Why do they do that?  So I tried to let that go and just hope that the taste of the steaks make up for it.  It didn't.  I just couldn't tell the difference between wagyu and a nice choice cut.  Made me think that wagyu continues to be overrated in my book or I just still haven't found a meat establishment that can win me over about wagyu beef.  Dessert:  So we had the popular monkey bread and they gave us 3 other complimentary desserts; a lemon thing, two scoops of ice cream (strawberry and lemon), and a small dish of fruit.  By then we were already stuffed and had a few bites of each.  Again no big deal.  Bottom line:  Craftsteak will still be on our list to go the next time we're in Las Vegas.  But instead, we would sit at the bar, have a couple serving of their bread, some appetizers and continue on with the evening plans from there.  Sorry Tom - Please pack your knives and go.  And don't ever cut my steak again!",

I have eaten $12 steaks and I've eaten $100 steaks and this tasted worse than some of the $12 steaks I've had.  The pear martini -- tasted like a lemon lime drink - WAY TOO SWEET and WAY TOO SOUR. Yuck. The vegetables - my brussel sprouts were drowning in a too sweet sauce... Not good  I had the monkey bread for dessert because the servers were all flipping out about how great it was.

    "text": "This Review will be for the advertised \"Fall Tasting Menu\" specials going all over at the MGM Grand.  I've always been a fan of Top Chef and thus had to make a stop at Tom Colicchio's place.  The Fall tasting menu at Craftsteak is only $79 and is served family style, drastically different than traditional tastings.    For appetizers, you are served 4 separate dishes which include lobster bisque (very delicious with big chunks of real lobster meat), a tasty caesar salad, large slices of prosciutto, and roasted red bell peppers.  The salad was mild and good.  The prosciutto itself is pretty standard, nothing special and the pepper as well.  4/5 for the apps.  For entrees, the fall menu includes kobe sirloin and skirt steak.  The kobe sirloin was really terrible - there are other reviews suggesting the same.  I personally felt that it had absolutely no flavor and was very chewy .  On the bright side, the skirt steak was supremely better and was one of the better steaks I have ever tasted.  It was very tender for skirt steak and full of flavor as that sort of traditionally robust meat should have.  Needless to say, I was really surprised.  For sides, you are served family style again, a sweet potato puree, jerusalem artichokes, and sauteed spinach - all very standard and nothing special.    \"As memories serves me right\" (ironchef) the dessert was a dark chocolate lava cake with expresso ice cream.  By the time, dessert rolled around, I was really too full to enjoy it - it tasted just okay.  Overall the portions here at Craftsteak, especially for the tastings are extremely generous and will leave you super duper full.  The food is above-average but definitely not that fantastic.  If it is in your budget, I would suggest getting better tastings like their Wagyu Tasting for $130.  Those steaks are most likely exponentially better and worth your time and money.  It actually might be better to order a la carte because the point of visiting a steakhouse is for the steak and not the fluffs like appetizers and sides.  Enjoy!",

But the portions are BIG, the meat and the sides. Two sides are enough to feed four; we ordered three and had a lot leftover. Our party of four had the filet mignon, short ribs, New York strip and rib eye. All were perfectly cooked to our expectations. Amazingly tasty! We also had the Brussels sprouts, assorted mushrooms and roasted cauliflower, all amazing. The bread was to die for.  No room for dessert. Service was EXCELLENT! Loved the atmosphere. Would eat there again. One suggestion and the reason I did not give them a 5...they need to offer smaller portions. 16 oz steak is just too much steak....the smallest filet was 10 oz. I would have loved a petite filet, say 6 oz., as I would have had room for a dessert. I hate leaving a lot of food on the table. It just seems so wasteful to me. As I said, would dine there again.",

The sides and bread alone are enough to choke a whale. Eating at those places often feels like a competition where manhood is measured in your ability to over eat.   Craft Steak isn't like that. The cuts of meat are flavorful and well prepared. The hanger steak and the short ribs are both great choices. The wine and whiskey selection is extensive and a glass of Johnny Walker Blue was $20 less than the price in New York. There are decadent choices like the monkey bread, the carmel cheesecake and the addictive garlic rolls. But none of it is so large and overblown to turn you off.   The service is exceptional and thr decor is warm and modern. The paintings of sad cows on the walk might make you feel guilty so don't look over there while you enjoy your steak.",

    "text": "Impressive selection of scotch. The bread they serve is pretty delicious. I don't really eat bread; the stuff makes you fat,  but I ate the whole plate it was so warm and delicious.   The main reason you should eat here is for their wagyu skirt steak. I usually get ribeye, but you can get ribeye, nystrips, filets, etc at any other steak joint.  Honestly, while their other cuts were good, they were nothing special. They certainly did not make this place stand out. $80 bucks for a cut of meat usually associated with fajitas had me skeptical at first. The combination of flavor and tenderness of this piece of meat was absolutely insane. I was shocked at how good it was. Incredibly rich, it was like the thing oozed butter when you chewed on it. It's also great if you're really lazy and don't feel like cutting your steak. It comes pre sliced into perfect man sized portions.  Extra points for a bartender that knows how to make a proper old fashioned. Sadly, it has become a rare sight.",

    "text": "URGENT...read before making reservation!!! I have lived in Vegas ten years and there are very few restaurants I have not tried, I love to go out to eat. This was my first, and DEFINITELY last time I will ever dine here! Start to finish, awful experience, food and service! Sorry to be grinch on Christmas, but ruined my week eating here!         Checked in for reservation for two about 645pm. got sat right away. That was a good start. Waiter came over about 10 minutes after sat, never introduced himself. Asked if we wanted a drink. I asked if they had moscato, his answer was sure. Now remember, this is a FINE dining restaurant that charges 69-219 a steak. Sure is not a good answer, nor is not telling us if any specials or giving suggestions. We ordered lobster bisque, waiter never asked if wanted apps. I got the scallops, friend got skirt steak. We ordered half order of butternut squash and risotto no prosciutto (I don't eat red meat but usually steak houses have amazing seafood,) and potatoes au gratin. Soup was ok, was much better when bread with sea salt dipped in it! It needed seasoning, but was a solid b+. Wine is almost done at this point, waiter NEVER asked if I wanted another. We kept waiting to be asked. Never did. Food arrived, risotto had meat in it, back waiter /food runner said he would find out what happened. Friend said skirt steak was pretty good, needed a bit of seasoning but cooked a perfect med rare. Stay away from scallops!!!!! So over cooked I barely got thru one. No sauce. Past yelp reviews say the same thing, I just wanted to give craft steak benefit of doubt in this...but reviews were right! So terrible!!! Waiter came over said he had spoken to chef and risotto should not have been wrong, no apology, new one would be out shortly. Risotto arrived when friend was almost done with steak. Told food runner /back waiter about scallops when he filled water. Twenty minutes later waiter came over and asked if we were done, I told him I had told someone the scallops were inedible. He shrugged and grabbed dish. We saw waiter maybe 4 x total entire meal. Every time he was very nonchalant and bordered on rude. Waiter was male, mid to late 50's, medium to heAvy build, I think he had facial hair but hard to remember him we saw him so infrequently!!! At this point, two things wrong and sent back, shouldn't a manager stop by???? Restaurant half empty so not crazy busy yet.        When he came back, no apology, asked if we were done. Umm....... I guess..... Did we want desert, yes, but such horrible experience didn't want to stay there any longer. Very annoyed no one asked if we wanted another drink at any point of our meal. Check brought over, waiter asked if room charge, did not show us check. Friend told room number and name at aria and waiter brought back check to sign. Gave us copy for records. We left, and after leaving, looked at check.... Were charged for TWO risottos and a full order of butternut squash not the half we ordered and recieved. So....terrible service, bad food, and then mischarged. Scam or just bad restaurant????? When spending 200-500 for dinner for two at a high end restaurant, I expect at least a B in food and service if not an A experience. This was a C at best, til we realized we were over charged. Then it became an F. I wonder how often this happens???? Any questions, feel free to write me. So much more was wrong, but this us getting long so will just end this the way it started...URGENT....STAY AWAY from this restaurant, happy to suggest 2 or 3 better steakhouses!!!!",

My scallops were absolutely phenomenal and my husband's steak was also wonderful. We loved the sides and SERVICE, but the monkey bread and apple creme brulee desserts were the pinnacle of our dinners.   Our only complaint is the number of men allowed to wear hats in such a fine dining establishment. No staff made the attempt to ask them to remove them.  We look forward to our next experience at Craftsteak.",

    "text": "Overall this is a 5 Star experience. The only thing that could knock it down would be that it is terribly overpriced. My dinner was comped by the casino so it wasn't a factor for this experience.  Before I get started on this $410 dinner for two, I must begin with the service. It was flawless, and I actually mean that literally. We cousin and I watched the \"busboys\" measuring the distance between the chairs while they were preparing the tables for the next guests.  I started with a glass of the Malbec. The server gives you a small pour directly from the bottle to makes sure it is up to your standards. I'm glad they do because it was terrible. The waiter suggested a Cabernet in its place. It was excellent (however I would feel badly turning down a second glass anyhow).  I started with the lobster bisque. As mentioned in other reviews, I was served a bowl with many large chunks of lobster. The bisque was poured over the meat table side. Best lobster bisque I have had in my life...at $18 it should be. My cousin had the Kobe tartar. It's not my thing, but he said it was excellent. We also shared the sea scallops. Cooked perfectly, and tasted excellent.  For the main course, I had the 18 oz rib eye with bone and my cousin had the filet. We really wanted a side of lobster, but they don't offer that so we split the 2.5 pound Maine lobster entree...back to that in a minute. I know this is getting to be redundant, but my steak, order medium rare plus was dead on. I don't know how they did it, but it was perfect. I compare all fine steaks to my favorite, Mastro's. Mastro's is still my number one, but this was a close second...excellent marbling, flavor, aroma. The filet looked great and was well received by my cousin. The lobster is presented shelled, in a light cream and chanterelle sauce. It was good, but they have got to be out of their minds charging $70 for it.  The sides were average to above average. We enjoyed the potatoes au gratin, asparagus, and baby shitakes.  My cousin finished it off with a cheesecake that he really enjoyed.  No complaints here. The evening was flawless, free (minus tip) thanks to MGM, and no more overpriced than every other restaurant there.",

My husband and I were able to enjoy a couple of cocktails and then a half bottle of wine (this combination was suggested by the sommelier), and shared the filet mignon and the rib eye, with sides of brussel sprouts and risotto. Everything was just amazing and our steaks were perfectly cooked to medium rare. The sprouts and risotto were flavorful and rich.   We were a little bit overwhelmed by the wine list, which was mostly full of wines that were priced much higher than we would consider ($200-$3,000 a bottle). But we were still able to find a good, though very small, selection of more reasonably priced wines.   We would have liked to try an appetizer or dessert, but we were sort of crunched for time so didn't have the chance. Maybe next time!",

All I can say is that the food was delicious (and great hangover food, to boot).  If you ever see their bread pudding on the dessert menu, order it without hesitation. And I say this as a person who doesn't like bread pudding or raisins for that matter, but this was still amazing.  If the food on the dinner menu is even half as good as breakfast, Craftsteak is sure bet. Pun intended.",

Horrible seating options with a half full restaurant, had to speak to a manager to be seated at a table not at the very back or on the aisle. I totally get spreading out tables to accommodate servers but this was not a good idea @630 pm. After finally being seated at a decent table, the filet was as expected, nothing over the moon fabulous for $58 and the NY strip was tough and impossible to cut with the weird knife. Steak was sent back and came out better but for $68 it wasn't in my top 50 steaks ever.  I would not recommend this steak house vs any top steak house in the US",

    "text": "I don't normally write reviews, as you can tell, this is my third one. So with that said, i gave this restaurant 2 stars because whatever i ate last night did not sit well with me. While service was excellent, there were a few misses with the food.  We ordered the wagyu skirt steak which was recommended by our server. My husband had the flat iron steak. While my wagyu skirt was tender and juicy, too bad it was pretty salty. That made it less enjoyable to eat.  I was sad that the saltiness ruin a perfectly cooked steak. But my husband's steak was cooked perfectly and it had the right amount of seasoning, not salthy at all. I've expected more from the wagyu skirt steak since it was $83 compare to the flat iron, $40. It was my first time ordering wagyu, so never again? We've also ordered the warm fraisse salad, lobster bisque, a side of the hen of the woods mushroom, and fries. Both the warm fraisse salad and the hen of the woods mushroon was also recommended by our server which was also a miss. While it may have been our fault for ordering that salad since both my husband and i do not like blue cheese, it was hard for us to eat. We were sold on this dish because it came with a poached egg and bacon. But we didn't realized that the blue cheese dressing overpower everything else on this salad. I think i may have gotten the runs from the mushroom, which was another hard dish to eat...I love mushrooms, but the way they cooked this was awful. I think they must have just put it in the oven and baked it for a min because it still tasted raw. And this dish was $15. Dont order this!! But in the midst of all of these madness, cames the best dish of the night,  the lobster bisque. It was the best i ever had!! The soup was light, delicate, and perfect! If it weren't for the lobster basque and my husband's flat iron steak, i would of given this restaurant one star. Sorry Tom , i expected a lot from you. I may just go back to mastro's steakhouse instead.",

The service and attention was excellent, the wine list extensive and the food was very good.  The very good part is what earned the 4 stars.  If they could get their sides to match the service and steaks then it would have been a 5.  Unfortunately, the sides we had were bland and unimaginative.  The risotto had little or no taste and was crunchy.  The steaks though were excellent.  Still a good choice and you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "***1/2 So after watching many seasons of Top Chef, i really wanted to give Craftsteak a try and if head judge Tom had any credibility to his name.  So with a little research i was happy to discover it was Restaurant week, which meant a lower priced tasting menu!   It was a good thing that I did my research because when i got there, there was no offering of the lower priced restaurant week menu.  If not  for a little research we'd all be spending $150 kobe beef and lobster.  The following was served family style. 1st course: Shaved fennel salad, grilled quail, buffalo mozzarella and a cucumber salad. My favorite was the quail, it was tender and moist; for my first taste of quail i was impressed.  I didn't care for the fennel salad it was too crunchy for my taste.   Main course: Prime flat iron steak, Angus skirt steak, and Diver sea scallops. My favorite of the 3 was the scallop, there was one per person and it left me wanting more.  The steaks were, well... steak, nothing extraordinary.  I usually order rib eye if i have a choice, but for $50 for everything, i was not complaining.  The sides were the star of the evening, Yukon gold potato puree, sauteed sweet corn, roasted shiitake mushrooms and we ordered a side of risotto.  The corn was sauteed in tons of butter but was not greasy.  The potato puree was  creamy and buttery.   Dessert was a mix of cheese cake, monkey bread and chocolate cake.  The desserts were good too, maybe the best cheese cake i've had, it was not as heavy and dense as others.  Monkey bread was covered with ooey-gooey deliciousness.   i'd recommend going here just for dessert if you happen to be in the MGM.    Pros: restaurant week provided a good deal at $50  Cons: the drunk people next to us dropping the F-bomb every other word, calling his girl a bitch and talking to other people at his table like they were across the room.  i think the entire restaurant heard his conversation.   Verdict: over all for $50 it was a good deal but i was not overwhelmed by the steak but of course i didn't get the Japanese Kobe and i wasn't about to spend upwards of $120 to try it.   After all it is what it is a steak house, straight forward food done simple.  So it lived up to its name, but i guess i was expecting more since we had been eating at other french restaurants earlier which is the exact opposite; refined, subtle, and complex.   Note: The restaurant is decorated all modern and fancy but the bathroom has the feel of a real steak house.  Pictures of Cows, and the sink resembles a feed trough. (at least the mens room)",

    "text": "So, me and my friend always try to do a steakhouse in Vegas.  We've done Prime, Gallaghers, and this time, for the ease for us to get to, decided on Craftsteak this time.    This place is much larger then it looks, and the decor is fantastic.  You walk through, and notice a lot, the pictures on the walls, very clever, and the all wood, including legs, tables.    We were extremely tempted to do 1 of the prix-fix menus, but we were not hungry enough to do that, as we ate more then we should have at happy hour.  Bread- I have to point out that the bread was extremely good, and addicting, they will just continue to bring it out in the tray it was cooked in, try not to fill up on the bread, as me and my friend partly did.  I started with the Maine Lobster Bisque soup, and my friend got the Warm Frisee Salad.  The presentation on my soup, was incredible, mostly cause it was so unexpected.  They brought the lobster over with all the seasonings in the bowl, and then bring the liquid part of the soup out in a aluminum warming dish, and then pour it over the lobster, which was great, it doesnt cook the lobster too much.  And the soup was very good.  My friends salad was very good, maybe even better then my soup, the pieces of smoked bacon were nice and thick cut, and the farm egg was fantastic.  Main course, I ordered the Beef Shortrib, and my friend ordered the ribeye, both med-rare.  My beef shortribs again came out in a little serving dish of its own.  I've had a lot of beef shortribs, these were incredible, possible one of the best i've had.  What was nice and refreshing about this was that the sauce was not a real thick almost bbq like sauce.  The shortribs feel apart fantastically, and the onions that were cooked with it, amazing too.  Easily would recommend that.  My friends ribeye, was surprisingly good.  You can easily screw up a ribeye, or make it have no taste, this was not the case in this situation.    Overall, yes there are better steakhouses on the strip, but this places easily holds it own.",

What I do have a problem with is spending $400 for a dinner for two when the food is okay at best and service is aweful.    The food was bland and reminded me of the food from Ruth Chris.  Not what I would expect!  We got rude comments from both bartenders and a dirty look from our waiter.  Apparently if you don't look like you have money (i.e. under the age of 30), you will be treated like crap.  I suggested this place to my mother a year ago when she was unable to get reservations at her perfered restaurant.  When I begged for details all I could get out of her was, \"it was good.\"  I should have taken this as a hint.    Will never revisit!",

    "text": "I am a steak lover, but I also want to keep my pants and not get bent over just to have one.  But you know what they say, \"when in Rome,\" especially if Rome involves a total stranger treating the entire meal!  So I learned that an acquaintance from Hawaii turned good friend was in town for a security convention, the same convention my sister was in town but was reluctant to inform me until she asked me to swoop her up at the airport.  Both nice surprises to say the least.  The great thing about these conventions is that they tend to boost the economy some, whether is be the party scene, pool parties, gambling revenue and my favorite, the foodie spots!  Yet the best perk of all is that most companies provide a per diem or allowance for the necessities and sometimes just to splurge on clients.  After taking my sister around to the local favorite spots, my buddy wanted to meet up at MGM and have a small dinner with his boss before heading out for some drinks to catch up and reminisce.  Little did I know that a small dinner would be at Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak.  I had never eaten here, but heard some good things from other friends visiting in town.    Upon arrival, the first thing another LV local and I was thinking was, \"$#!+, can I afford this on a spur of the moment and on a Tuesday of all things??\"  I was scanning the wall menu for cheap eats and the closest thing I came up with was a salad of some sort for nearly $30, if I recall correctly.     We were seated almost outside the establishment, in view of the outside bathrooms.  Could it be we didn't fit the part?  Maybe they weren't convinced that aloha shirts and slippers is considered formal wear in the islands, lol.  We sat down and everyone, but my friend's boss ordered a beer, Innis & Gunn to be exact.  What my friend's boss did order, was skirt steak that was beyond a hundo a way past my threshold of spending on meat that night.  He did, however, say \"order whatever you want, the company got it, except for alcohol.\"  It didn't quite register until both my homies ordered the New York Strip, probably because it was the cheapest on the menu at around $50.  I went with the rib eye since it was not much more than the strip and got it rare.  Word to the wise, as good as a steak spot this was, don't ever order rare rib eye, unless you want to be chewing on fat and cramping your jaws.  It would have been a much more enjoyable experience if it was a leaner cut, I suppose.  I also had a few bites of the strip steak and can't say that it blew my mind.  In any event, I can only imagine the skirt steak was well worth the price tag since oh dude literally drank his plate.  All and all, the food was not that impressive, the service was not to die for and I was not able to fully assess the scenery, unless it pertains to the outside of the restaurant on the walkway outside the restaurant.  Although, the camaraderie and laughs made up for this being a bummer.  So I would give it a 2 (overall) + 1 (just to say I ate here) +1 (since the bad boy was free, even though we spent nearly $70 worth of drinks per person).",

Started off with the Lobster Bisque, we had it spilt in two. Very comforting and tasty loved the lobster chunks!   Entrees:  -Halibut on top of seasonal vegetables (baby cartots, green beans, purple potatoes, snap peas) in a pool of buttery broth. It was so moist, flaky and cooked to perfection.   -Wagyu Skirt Steak melts in your mouth so tender and full of flavor. My husband's only concern was that by the time they brought out his steak it was warm and he missed the sizzle.   Sides:  -Almond Green Beans sweet & crunchy but nothing special.  -Potato Puree was good but too plain and soft for my taste. -Sweet Corn was very tasty!!!!   Dessert, my favorite! We got the Monkey Bread with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. It was sweet, sticky, crunchy! Must try! And an assortment of ice cream and sorbet...pistachio, banana rum, peach and Guava Passion fruit which was our favorite!   The ambiance was nice. Has a variety of diners from families with kids, bachelorette parties and couples on a nice dinner date. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I had high expectation I know it's $$$$.  I was excited to finally be able to try Kobe beef... Although I was only getting the American version, I was still excited.  As you can see from my profile I love meat... love it!  Yes a PETA member -- you know people for the eating of tasty animals!  So we made reservations for a Fri. night.  Was very exited and got there a bit early, so we were showed to the bar to wait for our table.  We didn't even finish our first round and we were ushered to our table.    What we ordered (party of two): We decided not to go for the tasting menu but we did order the tasting wine flights. Starter - Foie gras --- Yes even though I'm a proud supporter of  PETA , I couldn't help to feel just a bit bad about ordering this.  But once I tasted it, all my concerns were gone.  This stuff was outstanding.  This was very rich but the wine (Conundrum) paired very well to cut some of the richness.  Only complain I had was that it only came with 2 pieces of toast.  The foie portion it self was big but had to use the bread on the table in order to finish the dish.  Would have love some more of the toast.  Main - American Wagyu (rib eye my fav. cut)  bar none the best rib eye I've ever tasted.  It was just perfect, met my expectations.  For 105 bucks it better!           - Braised short ribs - what can I say, nice tender piece of heaven.   Sides - Wild mushroom risotto - very good              - Yukon puree - also very good I didn't pay attention much to the sides as I didn't want to fill up any valuable stomach real-state with the sides. dessert - ordered the dessert tasting menu. By this point I was in a meat coma so I couldn't really tell much but from what I remember it was good. Overall it was a wonderful dining experience very nice service, great decor and ambiance, and the food it was up to and even exceeded my expectations.  Yes it's pricey but what do you expect when you visit a sin city \"fine dining\"  establishment.  Would definitely come back, next time hopefully I will have a  better craps session so I can blow all the winnings here.",

    "text": "We booked our reservation about a month before even landing in Vegas, and the night before we took a cruise on by to make sure our reservation was still in order for the following night (which it was).  To say i was excited about dining here would have been an understatement and if you had to bet on it, well, the house would have took your money!  I started with the Yellowfin Tuna Crudo, i could not have a better sashimi at the best sushi restaurants - it was fantastically seasoned with rock sea salt - this may have been the first time that i experienced salt completely elevating dish to a new level.    The couple seating next to us raved about the \"best salad i ever had\"  The bread was actually baked biscuits that came to us in its own little cast iron pan were to die for, nice crispy crust on top and buttery, still steaming as we tore into them.  My wife agreed as she ate her mixed greens.  I reviewed the sides and our waiter, even though he was busy and had 4 tops & 6 tops on all sides around us, made me feel as if i had impecable taste with the items we ordered...  roasted filet mignon for me medium-rare, chicken for Rosa side of fries, wild mushroom risotto, & asparagus....  Fries, without questions, best i ever had - did not need anything to dip it in, to do so would be a crime...  Risotto had nice, big mushrooms throughout, very creamy risotto but Rosa did say my butternut squash risotto could challenge it any day  The filet was cooked exactly what medium rare should be, i had a steak knife but didnt need it, i want to avoid the cliche tender, melt in your mouth descriptions but thats exactly what it did, only better than anyone else has ever done it.  After finishing, we passed on dessert but were still given a nice little spread of cookies and mini pastries that were out of this world and small enough to not put us over the edge of having taking in too much food.  absolutely fabulous experience.  It needs to be relived.",

Of course, it's not really about that, it's about the fact that the steaks are knock-your-socks-off good. We had the Kobe menu, which means that for two people, we got to share two kobe steaks- a filet mignon and a skirt steak- 3 sides, 3 apps, and 3 desserts. Way, way to much food, it was actually freaking us out and we had to ask to have one of the sides removed from our table because we needed to focus our energies on the MEAT. Kobe skirt steak....my second favorite steak, after the cowboy cut i had at Porterhouse NY. Our waiter was really excellent also, very nice guy. I can't wait to come back here and hopefully order more smartly so I can enjoy everything and not pass out face first into my ice cream.",

The decor was very interesting and modern. It is very dim inside like most upscale steakhouses. We were first served with the Hawaiian rolls, and at this point we were starving so I scarfed them down, but I tried to refrain myself from eating too many because I wanted to leave some room in my stomach for the entrees. The tasting menu came with 3 types of salads including a baby beet salad, roasted red pepper and mixed baby lettuces, and a grilled quail. Honestly, I can't choose which of those appetizers I liked best because they were all so good. My gf loved the beets, however. Our main course came out, and we were stunned at how much food we were getting for what we paid for. We got flat iron steak, beef skirt steak, scallops, potato puree, shitake mushrooms and brussel sprouts with bacon. We worked so hard trying to finish our food because it was so delicious, but there was way too much for us to handle.   For dessert, the waiters brought out the monkey bread with hazelnut ice cream and banana bread pudding. They were soo good that we ate it all even though we were stuffed from the dinner. We were in serious pain for about 2 hours while watching KA.",

Probably the only thing I didn't like too much was the layout of the restaurant didn't offer much privacy or cushion from the noise of the other diners. Easy to find in the MGM Grand, and although pricey (about $250 for two of us with a few drinks) would go back next time in Vegas.",

We ordered the family style or shared menu and it was excellent and filling for only $60 per person (not including tax, gratuity and drinks), $100 per person after all was said and done.  That included a choice of three appetizers, a few meal selections and sides, a beautiful dessert assortment and a glass of wine with each course.  OUTSTANDING!!!  You don't need to order for the total amount of people in your group either.  We ordered for 3 and got two additional sides.  I was leery going into it because it takes a lot to fill my husband, but this hit the spot!",

The decor is inviting, warm and almost sensual - have to say its the best part about coming here - but the food aint half bad either!!!  We usually order a first course (appetizer) when we go to any restaurant but for Craftsteak, since I was feeling all warm and fuzzy inside we opted for a bottle of veuve clicquot instead.  I ordered the bone in rib eye , and I wish i would have taken a pic of how nice it looked but it was cooked to perfection! the sauce was very complimentary as well.  My BF ordered the Filet Mignon with Prawns and I stole one of the prawns and it was YUMMY - it was flavorful and tasty . he liked his filet, but he kept saying : \" shoulda ordered the ribeye!!\"  We also shared the Yukon gold puree - yum- and the asparagus ( kinda undercooked)   Overall - delicious!!!! the service was great too :) I learned quite a bit about the champagne we drank thanks to a kind gentleman whom we lent our ear to.    If you're in Vegas, and are craving steak - give Craftsteak a try!~",

    "text": "My husband and I had a great time at Craftsteak.  The steak was deliciously tender and the side dishes were excellent.  The rolls and the sweet potatoes were the highlight of the meal and actually were so good that they overshadowed the steak a bit.   We also ordered the au gratin potatoes and the mushrooms--they were good, but I would pass on them on a repeat visit because it was simply too much food.    TIPS: -Call ahead and ask for one of the semi-private booths.  The booths are VERY nice and some of the dining room seating looked crowded and loud.  The bar seating looked pretty bad.  We had a booth and loved it, but I wouldn't have been happy about paying $150 per person to sit in the loud bar. -It is A LOT of food. The portions are large and very satisfying.  I am a big carnivore and usually have no problem polishing off a salad, steak, baked potato, and bread--but this place left me stuffed.  We would have been fine each getting a steak and splitting one side dish. -I love wine, but here I would recommend skipping the wine and going with one or two of their specialty cocktails.  Not only were the cocktails delicious, but you get more bang for your buck with them.  The cocktails come in a shaker--so you get more than just one.   I normally order wine, but thought the bottles were a tad over priced for what they were.",

    "text": "DISCLAIMER: I've never tried any of their tasting menus. Always done a la carte. I just always think tasting menus have way too much food for me. But on the other hand, the point is to taste what the chef has to offer. So it's just my personal preference to stay away from tasting menus.  THE BOOZE: Okay, honestly, I've never had any of their specialty cocktails. Sorry, no dice. However, I can vouch for the friggin' delicious wines they have! Also, I don't really drink Rieslings, but the Riesling that they have by the glass is divine! So if you like Riesling, you must try it. And the best part is, the price by the glass is not that bad at all. I think it was like $9! And generally, the waiter has kind of a heavy hand in pouring. (Remember to tip well! If you can't afford the tip, you can't afford the restaurant)  THE BEEF: The first time I ate here, I was frankly not impressed. Everything was over-salted! I didn't want to be harsh. Maybe the person on the grill that evening had a heavy hand. But after repeated visits to Craftsteak, I've realized that every time I get a steak (kobe or not) grilled, it tends to be overly salty. So I've learned that I prefer to get the steaks roasted. The server explained to me that grilled means they just stick it over the grill and flip. Roasted means, they kind of sear it in a pan and then stick the steak into the broiler. Also, it seems when you get the grilled steaks, they slice up the steak for you when they bring it to the table. But when you order roasted steaks, it's the entire steak. Whatever ... I don't care that much as long as it tastes good! I've also had the braised short ribs. That is an excellent alternative to traditional steak. The short ribs were perfectly tender and fell off the bone.   THE SIDES/SALADS: Haven't tried a lot of the salads, but I do enjoy the beets or the shaved fennel salads. The ingredients are fresh and good quality. As for sides, I've also learned to tell them to go easy on the salt on the sauteed mushrooms. But I LOVE the assorted mushrooms because they are great quality mushrooms. Also, a great side ... I don't know if it's just seasonal, but the sauteed corn is delish! It's got butter ... and butter ... and more butter! And onion. And just good corn. The Yukon Gold Puree is pretty good - above average, but not amazing like the corn. I would recommend sharing the sides as they are pretty large. The mushrooms could be for two. But the potatoes and corn portions are definitely large enough for more than 2 persons.  THE DESSERT: Okay, I admit ... I've found what I like and I've stuck to it. Since many reviewers here recommended the cinnamon monkey bread, that's what I got on my first visit And I've never veered. So I suggest you get it too.   BOTTOM LINE: The service is excellent and the food is great, if you order the right things. One of the nicest waiters there is an older gentleman from Switzerland or something around there. I don't remember his name, but he's lived in all sorts of places and speaks a few languages.",

Shout out to our server, Kevin, who did an excellent job of explaining our options and was generally pleasant and entertaining. We chose to order ala carte instead of getting one of the combos.

    "text": "First off I am a huge Tom Colicchio fan. (I am watching the Top Chef DC Reunion as I start to write this) I am not sure if it because we share the same haircut or if it because we both enjoy a Cobb Salad but I just like the guy.  With that in mind, I have to say that I am deeply saddened to give our Vegas Craftsteak experience only two stars.  So you ask, \"how could you slam your follicle challenged brother with such a poor review?\"  In a word... SERVICE. Let me start by saying that I totally get how difficult a server's job is. I worked as a one for many years in both low and high end places.  I know that there are good days and bad days.  I always tip 20% unless something is totally off  and even then I never go below 15%.  Finally, it should be noted that we were dressed nicely (no Judas Priest T-shirts and cutoffs). I guess we were in trouble when we did not order wine.  Although the list was great, we just we not in the mood.  It seems like as soon as I handed the Wine list back, the service dropped to the Denny's level.  (I don't have a problem with Denny's too, but you get the point)  For some reason we suddenly had two servers.  It was not that it was busy (Tuesday Night) or that we were getting special service.  It was more like we got whomever was walking by at the time.  No check backs, just dish dropping and dish clearing.  Just a horrible experience.  At first I thought perhaps the B Team worked on Tuesdays but we certainly did not pay B Team prices. To wrap the longest, most boring review in the history of Yelp...  I did complain to the night manager after we paid the check.  I wanted to make it clear that we were not trying to get out of paying anything (food was great) but just that the service sucked.  She thanked us which was all we were looking for.   Tom...  You are still my man.  Perhaps you should putting on some sort of fake wig and try your place out on a Tuesday.  I think you just may will see what I am talking about.",

Last year, we went with the short ribs and lobster bisque as those were the signature dishes. Both were delicious. My fiance was able to cut his short ribs with a fork. I had hangar steak and it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.   This year, we wanted to try something new and got the rib eye, surf and turf, sweet corn and baby spinach. The sweet corn was too salty, but they made a new batch for us immediately. The rib eye may have been even better than the hangar steak from last year.   For dessert, we had the summer fruit plate and two scoops of ice cream (brown sugar sour cream and hazelnut chocolate chip). All of the fruits were perfectly in season, including pluots (my favorite!). The ice creams blew our minds.   On top of all this, the service was wonderful. Both years, they were able to arrange our table so we could sit side by side, without us even asking.   I have great respect for Tom Colicchio after eating here. We will likely make this restaurant a Vegas tradition for all trips in the future.",

We had rib-eye steak, mushrooms, Brussel sprouts and  a glass of red wine.  The food was good, and I especially liked the mushroom sampler - they were wonderful but either the sauce that was on the steak or the one on the Brussel sprouts had wheat in it.

I am MAD that he couldn't be bothered to check with the chef.  Also, I have to say the steak prices are outrageous. We prefer to eat grassfed steak but the ones on the menu were $150 and up for a 14oz steak. I can get a 16oz organic grassfed rib-eye at our local natural foods store for $18 so the mark up seemed crazy.  We had a nice dinner until I got sick .

All of the food was served family style and was absolutely amazing. I really enjoyed every single dish that was served but the dishes that stood out the most to me were the pork belly and wagyu skirt steak. DROOL!The service was top notch. The waiters kept the unlimited champagne and mimosas flowing.  And they were happy to get us additional servings of the dishes if we wanted more. My table went through a lot of the pork belly. It was awesome to see Tom Colicchio and get an autographed cookbook that included recipes of some of the items we ate that day. I definitely recommend this place and can not wait to go back!",

    "text": "Wow was our experience here mixed. Our waiter was, frankly, horrible. We asked him for recomendations and he just pointed us at the most expensive items on the menu. Not what we were expecting, especially since they were all samplers, not meals. Similarly, when my cousin and I were asking what beer he thought was good (we'd been drinking Fat Tire, and wanted something different), we asked about Old Engine Oil, and he simply said: \"Well, it's a beer, and it's dark.\" Seriously. That was it. COME ON!!!! You may not have tried it, so just say that. Don't stand there and tell me \"it's a beer.\" The steaks were good but overpriced. I've had better, cheaper, in other towns, but the meal itself was good. Their somellier was very helpful and knowledgable, and was able to steer us through the wine list. If (re: when) I'm back in Vegas, I will probably come back here, as my experience was colored by his poor service, not the meal itself. An additional note, for a big casino restaurant that seats a lot of people, the acoustics here mute conversations very well, so despite its size we were able to have a clear conversation as a table without having to yell. Very pleasant.",

    "text": "Almost perfect meal.  I deduct one star and that is not entirely the fault of the restaurant.  The food here is so delicious and the service was wonderful. My friend and I had dinner here during a business trip.  We are both fans of Top Chef and thought it would be cool to judge, the head judge of top chef.  I ordered lobster bisque, the rib eye, and chocolate souffle. The first bite of each dish will always tell you the quality of the dish.  After one spoonful of lobster bisque, I was sold.  It was so rich and flavorful!  The lobster pieces were so tender and juicy.  My ribeye was served sizzling in a metal pan.  I had ordered it medium rare.  It was cooked perfectly and the flavor just exploded in my mouth.  Each bite left me craving more.  It was unbelievably good.  My meal was finished off with the amazing chocolate souffle, that was a perfect ending to an amazing meal.   The servers were spot on and showed that this was definitely one of the best restaurants in Vegas. Why the deduction of a star you ask?  The tables are too close to one another.  You're practically sitting with the people next to you.  In this case it was very very bad!  We were seated next to some loud mouth guy that was bragging about how much money he made.  He also went on to talk about how he had been in rehab since he was 16.  I swear it was disgusting!.  We were trying to mind our own business, but you couldn't help but hear this guy's stories because our tables were so close.  I don't mind conversation during a meal, but I'd rather not hear about someone's sexual history and how many times a night a guy shags his wife.  I spoke with the manager about it.  She was very apologetic.  She gave me her card with her persoanl contact information and requested that I contact her about the evening.  I wrote a letter to  Lauren Vacca, the VIP manager.  I haven't heard from her since.  Which is fine.  I didn't really expect her to reply.  I just think it's bad management to not follow up on a letter of complaint.  Especially when I spoke with her in person about the situation. Nevertheless, Colicchio's Craftsteak is a good dining experience.  As long as you have decent people sitting at the tables next to you.",

The sides are huge so its not that great for a party of one (but who ever really does that anyway). I violated the \"dont order seafood unless you can either see or smell the ocean rule\" -  oysters on the half shell - Kumamotos were the best (from Washington State). Cuidado with the horseradish, it is by far the STRONGEST i've ever had. This stuff is the bomb though. The roasted beet salad was just the way i like it and the argula salad was delish. I only wished they had a salad that mixed the beets, arugula and the shaved fennel. i would have gone straight to salad heaven.  With all that said I paid close to $80 for a glass of wine, oysters and salad. That's Vegas for you.",

    "text": "OK.  So I'm really torn about my experience.  On one hand it was pretty good for Vegas, and on the other, it didn't live up to its caliber.    First of all, it's surrounded by a bunch of good restaurants.  I had no idea the MGM was such a hub for cuisine.  Secondly, it's properly labeled and you can't miss it when you're walking down the hall.  Now on to why I'm torn.  I emailed my reservation in about a week in advance since my friend wanted to go there in the worst way.  I thought a restaurant of this magnitude would at the very least call to confirm an online reservation, but they didn't.  When we got there, we were about 30 minutes early.  We were fine waiting for our table, but of course we asked if they had something available right then.  She said yes and proceeded to seat us in the bar.  THE BAR.  I understand that we're early, but if our table is going to be drastically different and not in the dining room, then shouldn't it be our decision if we want to take it??  After we sat down, I looked at my girlfriends in the dark bar and said \"WTF!  I'm so taking care of this\".  I went back to the host station and was met with super attitude.  She then told me that it would be a wait for a seat in the dining room, at which point I confirmed that it would be ready by 630p (our original reservation) and she said yes.  I have no idea who trains the front of the house, but they need a refresher course.  So we sat AT the bar and waited patiently for our table.  Once seated, the service was great.  Not impeccable, but great nonetheless.  Now the food was the best part.  When you read the menu, you think it's all ala carte and for each individual.  Yes it's ala carte, but they serve everything family style.  That's right, I said FAMILY STYLE.  Which means that you can order 2 different types of steak, 2 sides and 2 apps, all share and keep your bill under $100 per person.  Plus, their apps are HUGE.  We had a cup of the lobster bisque (yum), kobe steak tartare (more yum) and the foie gras (didn't taste it, but my friends loved it).  The tartare was truly the best I've had in a long time.    It's a damn good thing the meals are family style, because once the main events came out, I was pretty full and definitely wouldn't have finished my wagyu ribeye.  However, I was able to have a bite of everything and be completely satisfied.  I also loved that their hot teas are loose leaf and presented in a french press, just like their coffees.  That's a sign that someone cares.  Since there are so many restaurants in Vegas, there's really no reason to come back, but if ever I'm craving a steak, I'd come here without a doubt.",

The service was fine, and we finished with plenty of time to make it to the show. I will say, for as hard as Tom Collichio is on the participants in Top Chef, I was expected a little more.  Don't get me wrong, it was very good, but I wouldn't return unless I was invited by someone else. My favorite part of the meal was the either the whipped potatoes (side) or the maple/cinnamon flavored bunt/sticky cake thing.",

For appetizers what stood out to me was the raw proscuitto and red peppers in olive oil.  So fresh, so flavorful, so satisfying, and not greasy.  We had two kinds of steak and scallops for the main course and also got 3 sides.  Overall a very satisfying meal and we had leftovers!",

    "text": "SAVE YOUR MONEY!  I was greatly disappointed in Craftsteak.  The taste was beyond average for the price tag.  I had Yelped this place before going and generally, Yelp doesn't let me down.  I was celebrating a birthday and I was bummed that I didn't go to the other places I was looking at since I thought this was going to be much better.  Ambiance-  Modern, nice lighting.  The places opens up and is quite big.  See if you can request a booth for more privacy.   Tabletop for two people are large.  Always nice when you have a bunch of food/dishes/glasses on the table.  Reservations - Always highly recommended in Vegas.  Crowd - All across the board.  Either families with older kids or groups.   Price-  Ridiculous for the taste.  Portion was good though.  Location - MGM right by Shibuya.   Service-  Horrible.  I like one point man to filter everything through.  We had five but no one did the other person's job.   We had a manager come greet us, a sommelier for our drink/wine list, a busboy for our water refills and plate changes, a bread guy and the server.  In theory, it sounds great to have lots of people serve you, but to us it was just confusing when you needed something.  If I need more wine, I need to talk to a different person versus if I need more bread, etc.  After our server asked us about our food, he disappeared.  When we were done we had to wait 25 minutes to REQUEST the check.    In addition, I made reservations over the phone.  The person asked if it was for a special occasion to which I said birthday.  That wasn't even acknowledged at the front desk nor by our server.    Food- Menu had a good selection but was difficult to understand.  I had to ask what the Kobe Beef Three Course Menu was.  At the end, we decided to order a la carte.     1. Prosciutto San Daniele - Again, great portion.  A dish with about 10 prosciutto slices laid out.   However, I was hoping that the prosciutto came with something else.  Melons, asparagus, garnishments... anything to break up just eating cured meat alone.   2. Buffalo Mozzarella, Red Pepper Caponata -  Mozzarella was very fresh and good texture/taste.  The red pepper \"salsa\" was a bit salty and didn't provide anything additional to the mozzarella.  Whole toasted hazelnuts garnished the plate, which, although were tasty, again did nothing for the appetizer.  3.  Bread - Great presentation.  It came out in its own cask iron plate, piping hot.  However, there was a tad too much salt on top.  The bread was light and airy.  I didn't want to try to bite into a large roll.  However, when I tried to just eat the bread cut in half, the salty top was a bit much.    4. New York Strip - No, I didn't order the Kobe nor did I order the filet.  I wanted something that had flavor.  I was greatly disappointed.  The meat was seasoned very well.  However, I've had much much more more tender NY strip elsewhere.  It was a bit tougher than other high end steak houses that serve NY Strip.     5. Lamb - My boyfriend had the lamb chops which was very good.  Four chops were served.  Seasoned well, they were tender and had carmelized garlic and rosemary garnishes.  6. Sauteed Spinach- Good portion, enough for 3-4 people. Mild hint of garlic which was a nice touch.  7. Shitake Mushrooms-  Delicious and nicely seasoned to compliment the main entree, not overpower it.   8. Ciroc Martini's- Refreshing and comes with its own shaker.  One shaker/order provides enough for two martini's.   9. ZD Wine - Decently priced for a bottle.   Again, for the prices, the place just never wowed us.   There are so many good restaurants in Vegas that we were disappointed to eat here.   The place is piggybacking on its location because it would never survive outside of Vegas.",

Ok this is not just about the food, i'm complaining because the ambiance was too casual for my taste also. I don't know if i'm alone on this, but i like and expect my ambiance and decor to match those stiff prices. Waiter service was good, but not formal at all. Very casual. I actually felt a tad overdressed in my heeled boots and skirt. I guess if your into steak maybe you'd come here. My husband said his was really good. But honestly if i'm going to splurge i'd much rather go to the Eiffel Tower restaurant and receive all the little extras like the gourmet bread, the waiters folding your napkin if you get up to use the restroom, and the AMAZING views!!! Oh and dramatic elevator entry.  Ok this is turning into a review for Eiffel Tower so i'll just give you the bottom line: Nothing notable or worth taking a pic for at this place. Also try Mix at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. Again, they give you a cute assortment of breads, dramatic elevator entry and gorgeous views, even from the bathroom! They also have this beautiful giant glass chandelier that IS worth taking a pic of.  I know i am partial to the views and fine dining quality of these other two restaurants, but i also liked the food better too than Craftsteak.",

But didn't come here for the bread!    Cons - I knew it was pricey going in... just was hoping I could justify it by everything else. There were little things that stopped it from being an over the top experience... servers were condescending and intimidating.  For the ribeye, meat was chewier than I expected.   We were lucky enough to score a booth against the wall facing the entire restaurant so had privacy but could readily see how if you were a table of two seated in the middle it would be noisy.  We went at 9pm and it was packed.    I had higher hopes for Tom C's place and would have to say there are other places in Vegas to go for a steak where you aren't dropping $250-$300.",

    "text": "We so wanted to love this place!   It was our only big dinner out on our quick trip to Vegas. I had enjoyed a lunch at Craft in Century City a year ago, and we are big fans of Top Chef. Too bad the quality that Tom C. expects on that show has been left to wither at Craftsteak.   It started with being seated next to a server station. Of course most everyone is since they put it right in the middle of each dining section. The back to the chair in which my dining partner was sitting was broken. It took standing up and physically trying a nearby empty chair to get any attention.   It also took us some time before we realized that we were being served by a \"team\". Usually roles are clear when there are multiple servers. Here there was no head waiter, just two completely uncoordinated partners. One would ask if we wanted to be walked through the menu. We said, \"no thanks.\" Then the other waiter swung by and launched into an in depth description without asking. When asked if I wanted to keep the wine list, I said, \"yes, thank you.\" Then the other waiter came by and took it away without asking. More to the point, one of the two had no idea or ability to articulate what came with the shellfish sampler. It took asking three times to get to the fact that there was lobster, and another few questions to confirm that it was in a salad mixture of some sort. Icing on the cake: the busboy soaked us with his table rag while cleaning the table next to us. Gross.   Bottom line: this is not service worthy of the reputation or the price tag.   The food was a great big MEH. Here's the quick breakdown:  Wagyu tartare - delicious, but not the best I've had. Prefer the traditional French bistro/brasserie preparation. Fried zucchini blossoms - terrible. Turned one of my favorite sides/apps into piles of greasy, deep fried breading. Blossoms practically unrecognizable.  Ribeye - very tasty, well cooked, right on the money. Strip - fine, but not remarkable. Risotto w/peas and shrooms - delicious, perfectly al dente and creamy. Ramps & morels - ok, but uber salty. Snow peas - delicious! fresh and crispy. Au gratin - mediocre  Had a Pinot Noir and a Cab by the glass. Both were overpriced, but good.  First time I've left 15% gratuity in a long time. And I even backed out the tax before making my calculation.   We'd say that we hoped you'd clean up your act, but it is quite clear that you've sacrificed quality to maximize cashing in on celebrity and notoriety with this clip joint.",

    "text": "this could have been one of the best dinners i have ever had, though just my luck, talk about matters turning for the worst.  started off with a couple of don julio/anejo margis at the bar; excellent!!! bartender  was also very nice/professional. my gal and i were seated and we started off with their seafood sampler which was the absolute bomb. i think it was around $52.00 though it was worth every dime. real generous servings of king crab, lobster, 4 oysters, 2 large prawns, caviar, and etc. all the seafood is chilled.  anyhow yummy it was. as for our main course my gal ordered the rib eye, and for myself i ordered the filet mignon. we also ordered gratan potatoes & spinach for side dishes. o.k. here is where things started going south. when our steaks came out in these metal skillet type dishes, and we started digging into our steaks, i can honestly say that our steaks were both at room temp. not even warm. just to give tom colicchio some credit, i will say our steaks were barely warm. i looked over at my date and asked her how her steak was, and basically she replied, \"this is one of the worst steaks i have ever had due to the fact that the beef is actually cold. not even warm.\" of course i felt the same way about my filet. we were thinking of having our waiter take our steaks back and warm them up a little, except for the fact that both of our steaks were over cooked. when our waiter came over and asked us how everything was, i mentioned to him that our steaks were cold. our waiter was an older/nice latino man, and i liked him in the beginning, though when he started to bullsh_t me about that they don't serve their steaks warm/hot, i lost all respect for this guy. i was thinking to myself, does this guy think i am some kind of idiot? actually the problem is that i am 46 and i look about 33. my gal looks quite young too, so people take for granted that we are kids and that we won't know any better. they under estimate us all the time. well sure enough here we go again, except i never thought i would get this unprofessional service at such a nice restaurant. later on that weekend i called my good friend up who recomended this restaurant for dinner  and asked him about the steaks/skillets coming out cold. his story was completely different from what the waiter. he mentioned how the skillets should be hot and that you should be careful of them. mines wasn't even warm. so basically what happened was our food was forgotten about for a lengthy amount of time, our dipsh_t waiter didn't pick up on the fact that he was bringing us cold food or just didn't think we would catch on to this, and worst of all, our saturday night dinner was ruined, because of their weak staff. bringing cold beef to our table; hello. mc donalds serves hotter food than you shmucks. should have went to matros or nines. actually the sizzler would have been better. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!! They need to find better staff/waiters, ecspecially if they are going to be be bullsh_tting their customers. It amazes me, just with a little bit of effort, this could have all been avoided. But no, the waiter had to make lame excuses and make matters worse. not sure if management is aware what i going on at their restaurant, though i will be calling them tomorrow to let them know. oh and by the way, tom colicchio, your name is on this food, and i just want to let you know you get two thumbs down when it comes to your steaks buddy. your cooks are equally at fault for letting cold food leave your kitchen. you definetly don' know the first thing about running a kitchen. shame on you and this restaurant.  Did a little more research, the waiter was not the problem and I take back what I said about the waiter. Did some research, from what I understand this restaurant lets their steaks set for a while before they are served. The manager says that this helps keeps the meat's juices inside the steak according to them. The only problem I see is if you let them set out in the open to long at room tempature the steaks come out to the customer cold, which was our case. If you eat at this restaurant, be sure to tell them to maybe not do this for so long, that way you have a warm steak.",

I think you just get the wines for free with this deal but they are still well paired however common they are. I would try to the Kobe steak tasting one day and maybe compare this resto to the original one at Meatpack in NYC.",

We started with two each of the Daily Oysters.  My husband had the 14 oz. Domestic Wagyu Ribeye and I dined on the Black Sea Bass with Black Trumpets (amazing).  We shared the Hen of the Woods Mushrooms and Heirloom Cauliflower with Garlic Confit.  For dessert another visit to my favorite of the Daily Oysters, the Fanny Bay.  I would have changed NOTHING about this meal.  It was perfection!  Thank you Craftsteak for a wonderful evening......",

    "text": "Like probably everyone else on here, I am a big fan of Top Chef and Tom Colicchio. When deciding on restaurants to eat at in Vegas, Craftsteak was a given. Located in the restaurant corner of the MGM Grand (it was a little hard to find so allot some time to find it when you get there), Craftsteak at first looks like a quaint little coffee shop next to some bigger gaudier dining facilities. Don't be fooled though! Once you walk past the bar, it opens up into a fine dining area that you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  I had read some of the reviews here and searched for menus online to figure out what I was prepared to eat (and pay for!). There are 2 things you can do with the menu. You can either order the individual dishes that you want (mostly for those who have been there before and know what they want) or you can go with the chef's menu.   Understand that when you come here, you are prepared to eat meat. If you're vegetarian, you'll find dishes, but you won't get quite the experience that your fellow carnivores will get. Given that this was my first time here, I went with the Chef's menu which is for parties of 2 or more. On the Chef's menu, there are several choices and the increasing prices correlates with the grade of beef and whether you want lobster with that. I went with the domestic wagyu surf and turf which I think was $155 per person with a minimum of 2 people.  Don't worry if you don't like or can't eat certain types of foods when ordering the chef's menu. Tell the waiter! The chef's menu is anything but set and changes with the people who order and the waiter who serves you! My fiance doesn't like mushrooms so that was scratched off the menu and replaced by spinach and some potatoes that were mashed to the point that they were just golden liquid yellow goodness.  We started off with 4 appetizer dishes which included the following: prosciutto with a pear chutney , seared shrimp cocktail, fresh mozzarella, and a fresh caesar salad topped with fresh anchovies. I have to be honest, they were all very nicely prepared, very delicious, but if you're here to get \"mind blowing\" flavors and flavor combinations, this might disappoint you. However, I can't stress enough that they use the freshest of ingredients. I don't normally like anchovies, but these were delicious!  I had ordered a lobster bisque to taste since so many people recommended it, but I think the waiter forgot about that. Luckily he did because I was about to explode afterwards. TOO MUCH FOOD! LOL  Then we got served the main course: the skirt steak, riblet and lobster. I actually didn't think the lobster was all that stunning. It was good, but nothing special! The skirt steak and riblet, on the other hand, were simply delicious. They were so savory and literally melts in your mouth. The sauce is quite stunning and perfectly complements the expensive beef.  But wait! It's not over until after dessert! They gave us 4 desserts: spiced pineapple (eh), 2 types of sorbets (pleasant), chocolate lava cake (mm) and monkey bread with banana ice cream. Now, for me, the most mind blowing dish of the night was the monkey bread! It's pretty much like a cinnamon roll but the caramelized sugar and perfect amount of flavoring makes it worth coming to Craftsteak to have this pastry.   I forgot to mention earlier that their bread is fantastic, but don't fill up! I think we ate all 6 rolls and that doomed us for the rest of the dinner.   Service here is great. They are not only attentive (and not annoyingly so), but they are pleasant to speak to and very polite. However, I did feel that we lost some of that attentiveness towards the end of the night. If it were at some other restaurant, I wouldn't be bothered, but since we're tipping these people $80-$100 for the food, you would expect better.  Dress code is business casual (button up shirts, no jeans, no ties, no jackets). If you're here on the weekend, I recommend getting a reservation. If you're in a hurry to go to a show, then maybe the Chef's menu is not for you. If you order dishes individually, just let the waiter know that you have a show. They will get you out in time!",

We ended up ordering the Chef's selection, which includes an appetizer course, main course, and desert course. It was a TON of food. Quantity was not an issue here.  What we got:  Appetizers 1. Lobster bisque  2. Shrimp cocktail 3. Casear salad  4. Wild arugula salad Main course 1. Three steaks (NY Strip, Filet Mignon, Porterhouse) 2. Sides (potato puree, mushrooms) Deserts 1. Cinnamon Monkey Bread (there might have been another desert, but I forget... I was in a food coma by this point).  The appetizers, sides and deserts all deserve 5 stars (the lobster bisque is one of the best I've had). Ironically, the steak was the weakest point of the dinner. We asked for medium and the filet mignon was more like well done. The NY strip and porterhouse were better than the filet, but they were just ok. I've had much better steak at other restaurants. BTW, I also recommend the cocktails. They're very good.  Overall, an excellent dinner and restaurant. However, given the issue with the steak, I can only give Craftsteak 4 stars. Sorry Tom.",

I'm usually not a fan of skirt steak and more of a ribeye or porterhouse fan, but at this place it is very good. Super flavorful and tender. The ribeye wasn't anything special. Their steaks are all pre-cut when they bring it out, it might be a personal preference but I like cutting it myself.   We weren't too impressed with any of the sides and for dessert you have to try the monkey bread. You'll never be able to get something like that anywhere else.

The decor was confusing, I actually pulled up a description of it while we were in the restaurant. We thought it was messy and not well thought out. However, I did enjoy the cow paintings on the walls.  Food wise...we left unsatisfied. I expected more from TC's restaurant. Maybe we ordered the wrong items that night, but even the steak was nothing memorable.   Ordered: - Seafood sampler -- The best thing we ordered. Fresh, various items to sample and delicious. - Surf & Turf - Steak was lame. I eat steak often enough and that was lame. My cousin said the scallops were delicious. - Risotto - Bland. There was no flavor.  - Steak tar tar - Or something. This was good. - Monkey bread with Ice cream - too sweet and no other flavors. - Red Wine - I don't remember what we ordered, but it was a great choice.   I was disappointed since TC is very proud of his work when we see him on shows. Either his chefs were off their game, or this place is overrated.",

As mentioned in some of the reviews, the bread they served was great, and the simple Arugula salad with pine nuts and Pecornio was also quite nice.  Then came the $98 porterhouse for two.  Tough, unevenly cooked and absolutely flavorless.  I see why they served it with both bearnaise sauce and bone marrow, it couldn't stand up on its own.    I would have loved to explain my lack of enthusiasm for the steak to out waiter Peter, but after he took our order, was nowhere to be found, not once coming by to check on us.  His understudy did come by once, but my comment about being underwhelmed with the steak fell on deaf ears, not even registering an additional question from him.  Finals thoughts are that it is a big, impersonal Las Vegas restaurant more interested in turning as many tables per evening than serving a quality meal with attentive service.",

Best I've ever had.   Food: T-bone, ribeye, brussel sprouts, potato puree, and the white corn grits.  --everything was cooked deliciously. The steaks were flawlessly seared on the outside with the perfect color of pink on the inside. My favorite side was the potato puree, it's a must get. It's perfect with the steak.. But really all three were amazing.   Dessert: omg where do I even begin. I thought the monkey bread was the best dessert I've ever had (and I've had a lot of dessert).. But then.. The s'mores ice cream came out and I'm pretty sure that's what stole my heart. It wasn't too sweet but you get every single flavor of graham cracker, chocolate, marshmallow. Just. Amazing.  Now, the food was impressive but what was truly impressive was the service. Dan the man and Marky Mark were wonderful. There was a hiccup with our meal and dinner was taken care of. They made sure we were satisfied and were incredibly tentative. My boyfriend and I were speechless. We're used to Chinese restaurants who hardly know we exist to service that felt like we were the only people that mattered! Haha, sounds crazy but their service really left a mark on us. And on top of that, clumsy me got a stain and the sweet/wonderful waitress had a tide to go pen!  We will definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas and we highly recommend Craftsteak for dinner!",

    "text": "If you want the top steakhouse experience don't bother.  The steak had a great tasting seasoning on it but when I am paying for good steak I want to taste the steak, not something from the spice cabinet.   My wife and I both had the 18 oz Ribeye, mine medium rare and her's medium.   The steaks were cooked identical to a little more on the rare side than medium.   Since we had a show to make my wife just ate around the edges of hers.  When the steaks come out they are brought to the tables on a room temp cooper pan and they bring you a room temperature plate.  So by the time you are done eating the steaks are cold.  At top quality steak houses I am used to sizzling steaks on warmed plates.  The steak knifes they brought out were about as dull as a butter knife, they could barley cut the roasted onion much less the steak.  So while the steak was tender (but not even close to fork tender) you had to fight with it to get a bite off.  If you want an overpriced steak that is slightly better than Texas Roadhouse come here.  If you want a great quality steak with the top steakhouse experience find somewhere else.  Maybe we are biased because of the top quality steakhouses we have in Denver, but we were completely disappointed here after rwading all of the great reviews.   If I wasn't expecting a top notch steak house I would probably be close to 3.5 stars but compared to what they are billing themselves as I can't go higher than 2.",

    "text": "We went to Craftsteak on Saturday night, and I must say, it was very meh. The prices are what you would expect for a high end steakhouse in Vegas, and I've been to several now. The service was close to poor. We were seated promptly, before our reservation, and we were not addressed for the first 15 minutes we were there, except by the person bringing water and the menu. No server to get us wine, no server to take our appetizer order, no nothing. It was sad, since we definitely saw other parties around us getting attention.  The steak, a NY Strip, served medium rare, was average. And I mean average. It appeared to be overcooked and was relatively flavorless. Maybe my expectations were too high, but when you pay $50 a steak, you expect to be able to brag about it. Alas.  We all agreed that this was our least favorite steakhouse, and we will not be returning.",

We had a reservation at 6:15p and the concert was at 8p,  so we thought  that this would be adequate time for our dining experience, sadly it felt a lil rushed. We were seated an promptly ordered our drinks, they started the food by serving hot fresh baked rolls with butter, we then ordered the 10 oz Filet Mignon, Potatoes Gratin with roasted garlic and cream and the Risotto with butternut puree, prosciutto, and scallions.  This was definitely enough food to share! I really enjoyed all of the food that we ordered and would definitely go back again! (sadly time ran short and we had to rush out to our concert, so I was not able to try any dessert)",

Potatoes were cold, mushrooms were flavorless. Foie gras was served without any bread. The drinks all had an over powering lemon flavor with no alcohol. The manager fought with us telling us the food is supposed to come cold!! Amazing excuse. Really Tom Collicchio? Your name is in this restaurant, your making money by serving food that's not TOP CHEF worthy!! Please hire a new chef for your restaurant. This is a representation of you!!

    "text": "Although there are more than enough people to vouch for TC's Craftsteak, I still feel the need to talk it up.  I went to Craftsteak recently, end of December - New year's eve weekend.    I'll go right to it.  The best way to start any meal would be with that tasty, fluffy, buttery bread/rolls they serve.  I could not stop eating. I would go back solely for the bread and the lobster bisque.  The bisque was the perfect temperature, creamy, well seasoned, and had pieces of lobster in it.  Yay!! My only regret is that I shared.   I decided to go for the typical filet mignon, which was marinated nicely.  It was slightly under medium rare, which is one of the reasons for four stars instead of five.  Overall, I enjoyed my black angus.  For dessert, I had the chocolate souffle. It was yummy.  I love any melting chocolate with a scoop of ice cream.  My only complain is that I would have liked a warning about how small it was - couldn't even get my spoon in there.    Another reason it has four and not five stars is because there are paintings of cows everywhere! COME ON!!! I'll never go vegan, I love beef too much.  However, I don't want it staring at me while I am eating it.",

    "text": "For a high end steakhouse, especially one owned and operated by such a well known chef, my wife and I expected far, far, far better.    Our evening started off well with a very warm reception by the hostesses.  We were greeted by name and shown to our table almost immediately.  Once at the table, our two servers greeted us and took us on a tour of menu, with very nice explanations of the various options available to us.  They took our water and bar order and left us to study the menus a bit more.  Up until then, we were still very happy with our restaurant choice for the evening. The martinis from the bar were well done.  That said, no drink is worth the $16 they charged for them.  Then again we were in Vegas after all, so it came as no surprise that we were paying Singapore type pricing for our drinks.  Now to the steak; the most disappointing part of our experience at this STEAK HOUSE.  Even though we were prepared to pay for a high dollar meal, were certainly weren't prepared to pay the prices for their Japanese and American Wagyu options (hundreds per steak).  So, we opted for the Prime bone-in ribeye and filet options, thinking that the Prime designation was certainly enough to guarantee solid quality (aside from the quality expectation from Colicchio's name alone).  Not the case.    I ordered the bone-in ribeye medium-rare, and my wife ordered the filet medium-well (she's pregnant, so unfortunately can't order the meat too far on the rare side).  When our steaks came out, my ribeye was cooked to well-done, and my wife's filet was essentially rare.  If the kitchen had simply made a mistake by applying the right temperatures to the wrong cuts, we could have let it go since she and I could have just switched steaks.  However, the kitchen completely missed the mark on the temperatures, and what's worse, they served my pregnant wife a rare steak.  We sent both steaks back to the kitchen where they ultimately had to provide me with an all new ribeye to replace my original overcooked piece of shoe leather, and they re-fired my wife's to bring it up to the proper temperature.  The disappointment didn't end there, however, as once both my wife and I started cutting and chewing, we found the meat to be incredibly tough, dry, full of gristle.  All characteristics no-one would expect to find in either of these cuts of meat.    How did the Craftsteak team respond to our experience?  They acknowledged the poor showing of \"Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder back in the kitchen\" (our server's words, not ours), provided us with a complimentary serving of their Monkey Bread, and presented us with the full $250 bill.  This whole experience just emphasized that it is often easier to find proper cuts of meat and cook it at home to get an experience that is on-par if not better than most steak houses, and at a fraction of the price.  In the week following our experience at Craftsteak, we went to Costco where we picked up two Prime ribeyes for a total of $40, cooked them to perfection, and had a far better steak experience in the comfort of our own home (proper temps, tender, savory, flavorful).",

    "text": "I would give this place a solid 4. But you can't go wrong with A5 wagyu ! The service was excellent although we were definitely under dressed in our \"gambling clothes\". We were treated kindly and promptly , server was friendly and gave us some good Las Vegas pointers as well . Me and the mister got the sampler course , most definitely the most bang for your buck ! The wagyu 8oz is $275 a la cart. But if you and your partner both get the wagyu for $295/person you get multiple \"tasting size \" appetizers ,sides ,and dessert . And don't let the \"tasting\" make you think the portions are small.. because they're not! All of the appetizers and sides were tasty but nothing out of this world compared to other high end steak houses . What we have to really focus on is the wagyu-hands down best cut of steak you can eat. It's extremely rich and tender . So with that in mind I actually think next time we will either share one cut and get the sides a la cart . Or get the tasting menu and get only one wagyu and one regular filet cut . The wagyu is delicious but can get too rich and filling quick . It's just something to try at one point of your life for sure . So if you don't read anything I say here until the end ... GET THE WAGYU!",

We ordered the $155 each American Wagyu chefs choice menu.  Lobster bisque was served first and it was really good. The appetizers we had were the warm frieze salad, buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto.  These were pretty good the Warm salad was a good twist, the mozzarella was good as well as the prosciutto.  Next was where it went south.  My wife had the filet and I had the skirt steak.  My wife's filet came out medium rare and she ordered it medium.  My steak was cooked correctly, and the sides we got were Brussel sprouts, potato puree and mushrooms.  Everything basically came out cold though...  we hate to send stuff back to the kitchen but had to, when you are spending this much money your food should be cooked correctly and warm.   The potatoes were very runny and had just a layer of butter on them, the Brussel sprouts where in a sweet glaze that was overpowering.  The mushrooms basically tasted like chemicals. When we sent the steaks back, they basically just put the plate they were on back in the oven or something to heat it up.  So my steak came back medium but warm and every other high end steak house that I have ever ate at has replaced the steak with a new one, not just thrown it back in the oven.... Again the server was great he tried to make up for it, but it just wasn't there.   The desserts were good, the cinnamon monkey bread was amazing, the Creme brulee was pretty good as was the two scoops of sorbet.   With all the choices in Las Vegas to go to, we would not return to this place again.  A $500 meal that I wish I could have back.",

I had the rib eye medium rare and it wasn't very tender. My wife had the filet and that was a bit better. The mashed potatoes side was so runny it was like the consistency of a smoothy. Which might be ok for some but it was very bland and the texture just wasn't right. If I had paid maybe 25$ a person for the meal I would say it would have been worth it but considering our bill was $160 without tip for one mixed drink, two steaks and one side, it was not worth it at all. I've been to fine steak houses and I can honestly say this was the worst of them. I prefer Mastros or Larsen's much more. Don't waste your time here.",

My steak was inedible and as I have pointed out, I do not return food to the kitchen. Either they get it right the first time or I don't want them near my food for another go round. When I left my steak uneaten the server asked if I enjoyed it. Really? What did he think? I pointed out that it was inedible and he told me if I only let him know, he would have brought me another. But at this point, it was too late.  He explained this often happens and they just serve it to the pigs. Gosh, thanks. The pigs? So it's either me or the pigs. Nice visual.   Rather then an apology or can we bring you a glass of wine, a few other employees made their way over and short of actually making it right, let us leave feeling like we we had done something wrong. Maybe it because we weren't dining with movie stars. I'm not sure what it was but something just didn't click.  With so many fabulous restaurants in Las Vegas, this one should be avoided. Bad food and rude wait staff and a $300.00 bill. What more could I ask for?",

She was just talking to another server, and looking down at the screen, not even acknowledging us or saying hi and asking us to wait a moment while she did her thing. Once she DID greet us, she asked if \"those two are with you\" and when I replied yes, she said \"Oh... we don't allow men with tank tops inside\". Exactly in the tone you just read it.   So we walked down the mall to buy him a t-shirt.   Once that was done we went back. And the hostess acted like she didn't even remember us, even though we were gone for 10 minutes, if that.   We were finally seated, where we were greeted by our co-servers. Both of which were very friendly and attentive. We were served water and bread, and that's where the night got slightly worse. One of our party members drank some water from his glass and felt something sharp. He fished a piece of glass out of the water and it cut his finger.   We let our server know who was very good at handling the situation.  The food itself was delicious. We got the charcuterie platter (should have included cheese), wagyu ribeye, sea scallops, potato gratine, mushroom assortment and the asparagus. I'd probably skip the mushrooms next time, as they were under seasoned and bland.  Our night was redeemed when the manager made an effort to come over and apologize about the broken glass. She comped our appetizer and gave us a free ice cream platter. The ice cream was amazing.   If it wasn't for the hostess and the broken glass, I could comfortably give this place a 4-4.5 stars. I probably won't visit here again.",

Did not disappoint. Skip Heritage Steak, which is the lesser, shabbier version of Crafsteak (for more or less the same price).  I would return to Craftsteak anytime I was in Vegas.",

My favorite dishes/sides were the diver sea scallops and the risotto. They'll even make the risotto vegetarian friendly (no prosciutto or you can ask for it on the side). As for drinks, the La Vie En Rose was my favorite and I would definitely recommend the cinnamon monkey bread for dessert.",

We went with a party of 6 and the night started off great with some good appetizers. However, once the main courses came it was down hill. Two of us got the bone in New York strip, both of which needed to be sent back due to the temp being incorrect on one and the other being so tough that it was  inedible. The waiter was more than accommodating but this still caused two of the meals to be delayed by which time the other sides were cold.   Additionally the replacement steak was a skirt steak waygu which was cooked well but not the steak either of us ordered. Which we mentioned and the easier said these were better quality steaks and allowed the kitchen to get them out quicker (15 min later).    We were celebrating two birthdays and the desserts they brought us were delicious.   With this said, when the bill finally came they still still charged is for the entire meal (both bad steaks) and only comped the desserts. The waiter said that the better steaks (skirt) were only charged at the NY steak price (67) which was the accommodation.   There are too many better steak houses in Vegas which are a better choice.",

    "text": "Arriving around 7 PM on a Wednesday night with a party of 6 with no reservations we were somewhat surprised to find there was no wait, actually the restaurant was mostly empty so we figured either it was great timing or something was amidst and the place would fill up during our dinner, either way this provided a great opportunity to experience exceptional service and delicious and extraordinary dishes from the kitchen something you'd expect from restaurant owner, food critic and celebrity Chef Tom Colicchio.  We were seated at a round top with service set up for 8 with a little adjusting they reset the table for six which was absolutely fantastic allow us plenty of room to enjoy our dining experience. We also were told upfront we would have two servers taking care of us tonight and we were introduced to both of them at the as time I think this resolved any confusion that was mentioned in previous reviews.  Our drink orders were taken and tall glasses of ice water accompanied the cocktails as did an iPad showing the extensive wine list that we requested to have served with our dinner. We were clear that we wanted to enjoy a few cocktails before selecting our meals and both servers honored our request and never hurried the process they did inform us of all the specials as well as the chef prepared dining options then quickly left us.   - Maine Lobster Bisque (Tarragon) - served table side, its apparent that this starter dish is something Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak is very proud of, a nice potion of hand chopped lobster meat is first added to the bowl followed by ladles of a warm cream based bisque folded in, not only was the bisque served at the perfect temperature it's rich creamy texture combined with the chopped lobster meat meant each succulent bite was as good as the first.  - Parker House Rolls - fresh from the oven still hot and painted with melted butter in the pan they were baked in, this is definitely not your normal bread service. These rolls virtually melt in your mouth and can be very addicting, fortunately they will bring more upon request no doubt this is a request they are accustom to and there is no hesitation in getting another pan or two to the table.   - 18 oz Ribeye (Dry Aged RR Ranch, Bone-In) - ordered medium rare, tradition has it that in order to preserve the natural juices Craftsteak takes extra measures to ensure these flavorful dripping aren't wasted on the sizzling grates after a searing the steaks are transferred to a cast iron skillet for a trip through the oven until the perfect temperature is reached then rushed out to the table to rest along side a roasted sweet onion to be portioned as you see fit. This steak no doubt was filled with flavor as are most ribeye steaks, the pan roasting added a different element slightly charred on the exterior the first slice of the knife revealed a slight warm red center, the texture and mouth feel definitely represented the aging process well I'd rate this steak very good and memorable.  - Sides - although the portions are advertised as \"enough to share\" don't raise your expectation to high this is meant within reason each side is enough for 2 - 3 people to sample if your group is expecting serving size helpings split each side between two they aren't inexpensive but are very well prepared. - Asparagus, Lemon Zest - these grilled stalks were very tender and grilled with a slight coating of a light lemon oil zest infusion you can't go wrong with this choice. - White Corn Grits - (Bacon, Guryere, Chives) no need for you to be a fan of this southern ground delicacy to enjoy this dish, the incorporation of the bacon, cheese and chive transforms this dish into a magical melody that is so simple yet may be the topic of discussion as each of you try the first bite it is really that good. - Potatoes Gratin - (Roasted Garlic Cream) as Guy would say \"shut the front door\" these thinly sliced potatoes are cooked tender with a hint of crispness on the outer edges layered in a hot bubbly sauce that would have you licking the crock if you were at home.  All of this paired with a nice Pinot Noir that I didn't pick and I've forgotten the label (sorry it was really good) made for a great dining experience by the entire party we finished with a cup of fresh French pressed coffee with real cream and a some nice sweet port no complaints at the table and a place I definitely would come back to with or without reservations.",

    "text": "You WILL get laid!  You WILL have an awesome meal!  You WILL be comatose.  It WILL NOT be cheap :)  I have not had a meal where EVERY SINGLE DISH was AWESOME!!!  My buddy and I visited Las Vegas recently and had a craving for steaks after golfing.  He is from NYC, so when I pulled up the Yelp reviews, he immediately chose Craftsteak.     I honestly did not know too much about the place except that it was expensive and got a number of great reviews.  I quickly called to make a reservation and that was easy-breezy.   The staff there was good looking.  Hot asian hostess sat us down and our waitress was a MILF (All names have been erased for confidentiality)  The meal was superb.  We chose the $155 per person domestic wagu beef.  The meal was so filling, YOU DO NOT NEED TO ORDER ADDITIONAL SIDES.  Here is my summary of each dish:   1.  The salted bread.  So super soft, buttery and salty.  Melted in my mouth... I had three of these babies. 2.  The romaine salad.  Crisp and the croutons were the best I had.  simple but delicious 3.  Beef tartare.  Delicious, but we did not finish.  the crostini were perfect.  Just crispy enough. 4.  Mushrooms.  Delicious.  Finished that. 5.  Brussel Sprouts.  Good.  Not the best I have ever had, but damn delicious 6.  Potato puree.  Very good.  did not finish 7.  Filet Mignon.  This was my favorite.  Yum-yum.   8.  Skirt Steak.  Also delicious, but I liked the Filet mignon better 9.  Buffalo mozzerella.  Also good.  The mozzerella was super soft.  I presume it is cause it was made there. 10.  Lobster Bisque.  This was gone in 60 seconds.  I am an average eater.  I could barely eat the dessert.    We ordered the Yamazaki 12 $15 per glass and the Midleton Very Rare $30 per glass.  Total tab with a $65 tip was a tad over $500.  It was for one of my good buddies that I went to highschool and college with.    This is definitely a place to bring somebody special to you or a hot date.    I wish I could have said that I won at the casino and that it was, 'Compliments of the MGM'  But maybe next time.   Oh, do not worry too much about dress code.  I was wearing my golf attire and my Steelers hat.  As long as you can foot the bill, I think they do not care :)",

Much to our dismay and shock, now they took off porterhouse steak from their regular menu. If Craftsteak is trying to improve revenue stream, just charge us more for the items we come in for instead of taking them off of the menu. When hubby and I walked away coz we had no reason to stay, they tried to stick a beer bill to us for something we didn't touch. What is going on Craftsteak?! What happened to your good food and fine service?",

I went with a group of 5 where we ordered their set dinner(the $140) one where it was simply amazing. We ordered 4 sets of the dinner where we could try each of the steak.   Before I start explaining the food, they provide you with AMAZING dinner roll...that I simply claim that I would come back just to eat dinner rolls. The dinner roll was so soft that I didnt think bread can have this kind of melting texture with some sea salt on top. You can add their butter to it to make it even more amazing(but it would taste amazing even without it). Yes...I ate 5 and yes my waiter asked me if I wanted more and my answer is obvious. I had it for breakfast the next day when I was a bit buzz...microwaved it for 15 secs soooo goood still.  Back to topic, you won't feel ripped off when you get the dinner for $140 set because it comes with A LOT. There are 2 salads, prosciutto AND the most amazing of all the Beef tar tare which is WOW....they give you two toasted bread which was toasted perfectly. I don't know what to say because it was that gooddddd. Omg... I want some right now.   Came with 4 steaks which all of them were REALLY GOOD. YOu can tell how good the quality of the steaks are but my favorite is the skirt steak. That is just me of course. They already cut the steaks for you which you would think that all the juices will be good but it isnt...Regardless if you haven't had it you might want to try the $140 deal once(or any other deals they have )  The crazy part was that we were so full before we even finished the steaks...(must be the dinner rolls :p) but we barely could hold our ground after finishing the entrees.  The waiter came with 3 desserts at first and I was like ah dude...I think we got this. The waiter eventually came back with another waiter and came back with 6 OTHER desserts. From gelatos to cakes to tarts. We were done.   I say that this might be another way to have a happy ending besides you know what in Vegas.   I'll come back one day Crafsteak.",

The steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned very well.  The service, however, was ok. The server seemed disappointed that we didn't order any appetizers or desserts. I understand this is a restaurant business and they need to meet a certain quota but not everyone over order and let food go to waste. Plus they served us dinner rolls before our entrees, which was more than enough. If it wasn't for that I would've given them 4 stars.  The funny face cow paintings also distracted me while I was eating my steak lol. Found it odd and disturbing that they would put them on the wall.  If I want to have a flavorful and good quality steak in a nice ambiance with some decent service, I'd just go back to Gordon Ramsay Steak. It meets all the standards of a fine dining steakhouse.",

From my personal experience, it'll be hard to find something better.   We came with a reservation at 7 on a Saturday night in April with a party of 7. We were seated immediately in a room near the back. It was really dimly lit by many Edison bulbs which looked nice, but were not so conducive to reading the menu. Fortunately, members of our party had been there before and ordered us all the Double R Beef. It costs $125 a person, but I promise you it is worth it.   They start the night off with the fluffiest, most delicious rolls you have ever had. I accidentally ate 5, which decreased my eating power for the rest of the night (that is bad, you need to bring your A-game for the amount of food they bring). Then they bring out 7 different salads (if you are a party of 2, they bring two salads). Every single salad was delicious. After salad is the beef and sides. 7 types of delicious amazing beef and 7 more sides to compliment every dish. By far, my favorite entrees were the Filet Mignon and the Hangar. We also got a side of brussel sprouts which were cooked to perfection. Finally, if you haven't eaten yourself to death, they bring out dessert. So many desserts! My friend was celebrating his birthday, and they brought out a really nice plate of little chocolates with 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate.   The wine parings were excellent, we even talked the sommelier into bringing us an unlisted bottle, it was only available for the wine tasting event!  Now I know that Top Chef isn't fake, Tom Colicchio is the real deal and really does know what he is doing. Thank you Tom. You gave me a great meal. Even though it was really expensive ($180+ per person) and you weren't actually there. That could've been a cool instagram but you messed up on that one. I'll let it slide, just because those dinner rolls were so good.",

It's in the MGM along other restaurants like Emeril and Wolfgang Puck but really stands out.   They recommend business casual but nothing is really enforced. The ambience is what you would expect. Dim lighting, bustling work flow and interesting things in the wall. Service was awesome. They have multiple people covering every aspect on service. My water glass was never empty!   Food can't be explained in words.  Prime Rib Grilled was to die for. Medium rare all the way!  Short Ribs were soft juicy and juicy. Spinach was great.  Potato puree is some black magic voodoo stuff. How is it that good. HOW! Hen of the woods mushrooms were amazing.   In a city of a million places to eat, I'll make my way here every time.",

We were pleasantly surprised as we thought this dinner couldn't get any better, but our service was even better than we remembered, and of course THE FOOD!   We treated ourselves to the A5 Wagyu and couldn't help but indulge in almost every side. It did not disappoint! Our only wish is that we would've been able to finish the delicious potato puree.   This is an absolute must when in vegas!",

My Sister and Brother-In-Law picked this particular place based on intensive research, and clearly, it did not disappoint.  An intimate, ambient setting coupled with delicious food and great company went to create a dinner experience that I will not soon forget.  For myself, I can only speak to what I had, including the \"Yukon Gold\" Potatoes alongside my 18oz. RibEye (Bone In).  Straight Mind-Blowing!  Both melted in my mouth as they complimented each other on the plate and in my Esophagus.  Each knife slice of the Beef was like a Violin playing its role in a Sonata as it moved the Steak from plate to mouth, a symphony of flavors which I can still taste if I close my eyes tight enough.  Impeccable attention to detail both with the food and atmosphere created an environment which I did not want to leave, postponing the inevitable a bit by ordering Dessert.  Cinnamon Monkey Bread was possibly the only thing on Earth that would have been able to follow up such a main course, and it too delivered with Five-Star accolades as it wrapped up a meal which gave me a whole new perspective to the food scene in Las Vegas.  I would recommend Tom Colicchio's CraftSteak to anyone who recognizes incredible food and who is looking for an amazing evening of culinary delights...",

It was tough, dry and needed some A1 sauce or something even more pedestrian to grant it a bit of flavor.  I've had far better steaks at Outback.  Lone Star is another $20 steak joint that bests this place with ease (and half the price).  Ambiance was nice.  Service was good (not great).  Cocktails were good.  Presentation was OK.  When I pay that much for a steak, I expect a lot from it.  I was very disappointed.  Maestros, Mortons, Flemings, etc. all charge roughly the same but they are by far the preferred choice.  I'm thinking there are some shills rating this place higher than it deserves or they just haven't been to one of the other sites for True Prime beef cooked to perfection.",

    "text": "Holy cow.  The Spring tasting was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.  (does that look as annoying as it was to type out?)  Whatever -- completely worth the $60; I was almost depressed we couldn't bring back leftovers. Top notch: I'm sad to say, top of my list was the potatoes.  And I say \"sad\" only because I love meat so much.  But the potatoes aren't top of the list because the steak wasn't amazing -- cuz holy cow, those steaks were, and those scallops? craazy good -- but the potato puree (read: mashed potatoes) were SERIOUSLY CRAZY GOOD.  Seriously.  i could dream about those potatoes, and it's been a week.  My key lime pie martini was perfection.  Woulda been heaven if it were rimmed in graham cracker crust.  And I felt bad b/c I ordered it to start out with, and then got self-conscious when we started with appetizers almost immediately after I was served the drink, b/c duh, it's sooo sweet, it's like a dessert.  And then our server came over, concerned I didn't like the beverage b/c I let it sit, oh, practically the entire meal (though he'd checked with me right before our 3rd course if it was to my liking -- very nice).  The wine pairings were also fab - -bestest was whatever was paired with the meats course.  Holy cow -- I'm not a wine fan, but I almost ate the meat solely to enjoy the wine more.  Almost ;).  I also, personally, loved that our server was trying to politely, but strongly, discourage us from ordering a steak well done, pretty much :D -- but my friend is pregnant, and explained that as much as she loathed ordering a steak well done, she had to.  So he called it \"medium plus\" and brought her her own steak, so that (even though it's all served family style) my other friend + I could enjoy the steak at its bestest.  And oh, we did.  And then the desserts -- heaven.  Even the bread pudding, and I don't like bread pudding!  The chocolate lava/souffle was heaven -- perfect texture of a brownie/dense cake, gooey REAL chocolate center, and a bit of crustiness from some sugar crystals.  WOW.  Monkey bread -- who'd have thought that would make a good dessert? I've never had it before, so I certainly didn't, but -- it totally was.  Yums.",

We were very excited we chose Craftsteak due to the fact that the night before we had a mediocre experience at Delmonico, Emerils restaurant!  Great food and great service filled our dinning experience! We both started with the quail and buffalo mozzarella appetizers!  We then had the scallops, skirt steak, and the flat iron steak which was accompanied by the Yukon puree, the shitake mushrooms and the sweet corn!   Desert followed and there was a chocolate lava cake with espresso ice-cream as well as sticky bread with banana ice cream. Both items were scrumptious!  I highly recommend Craftsteak and would most definitely dine here again. Great staff and ambiance as well as great wine make Craftsteak a great place to dine while in Las Vegas!",

We didn't order wine, I had a martini and my fiance had a beer.  The arugula was great. VERY well seasoned. The Charcuterie Sampler was a meal itself. The mustards were excellent. We got a New York cut and a filet. The New York was the best I have ever had in my life. It was perfectly seasoned. We got mushroom risotto and the baby carrots for sides. The mushroom risotto was SO good, I ate it for breakfast the next day. They gave us a dessert assortment that was very good. I can't really name everything they gave us. The grape sorbet was my favorite out of the whole lot.",

I wanted to see if those aspiring contestants had reason to listen to Tom Colicchio.  Having been to Aureole the previous evening, I figured it was going to be difficult to top. But man, top it did. Classy decor, friendly and knowledgeable servers was just the tip of the iceberg.    I don't think I need to repeat what others have said about food specifics because we had a similar experience with everything from the steak and scallops, to the sides and dessert and wine (the wine pairings could not have been better).  Let's just say in general, they had the kind of quality food that makes you hum things you normally hear coming out of a bedroom. The only reason I am glad I can't go to this restaurant more often is because I'd probably explode from the hedonism I'd subject myself to by not being able to resist eating here as much as I could.  Top Chef wannabees, Tom walks the walk. It would serve you well to listen to what he has to say.",

My husband and I started with the buffalo mozzarella, which was very tasty! I had the 10 oz. filet mignon and hubby had the 16 oz. NY strip. His was overcooked and mine was melt in my mouth heaven. We had some potatoes and asparagus to share for the table, which were okay. My husband's father had the Kobe style waguyu beef, which he gave every one a bite of...I think my one bite was $25 worth, haha. It was very good, don't get me wrong, but it didn't wow any of us for the price tag that it held either!   I really enjoyed craftsteak, however, the rest of the family wasn't as impressed.",

    "text": "Given the more than ample supply of dining options (and steakhouses) in Vegas, I don't think I'll come here again (for a very long time).  The food quality was good.  Quality meat indeed.  But I would expect that a restaurant specializing in steak would know how to cook its quality steak to the specifications of medium rare, medium well, etc.    Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  My bf's medium rare request for his filet mignon was translated into an almost medium well steak.  He had to send his back and then the second stead still wasn't cooked medium rare (it was more medium).  My request for a medium well steak, but closer to well than medium resulted in a well done steak.  I generally don't find medium well steaks to be dry, but this one was dry.  I expected more from a steakhouse.  Perhaps the lesson learned is order your steak cooked a little less than you normally would.   Despite the steak cooking issue, there were some highlights to the meal.    The beef tartare was good.  I was very pleasantly surprised since the idea of eating raw meat is rathering repulsing to me most of the time.  Their potato puree was delicious.  I could have taken a straw and drank that up.   The chocolate souffle dessert was amazinggg.  Yum, yum, yum!  On the side was some caramel ice cream which was equally delicious.   It was a good dinner, but it just didn't live up to the hype.  I wish I was reviewing how good the steak was instead of how good the sides were.",

    "text": "Ate here on new years day. I went with a party of 7 so we got a variety of steaks to share. We ordered the lamb, filet mignon, ribeye, NY, tbone, chicken, and wagyu ribeye. The steaks were all were cooked medium rare with the exception of the NY, which was medium well.   I got the ribeye wagyu and expected it to be amazing. Like the other review said, your expectations for a $115 steak are pretty high, but it disappointed. Did not melt in your mouth and I didn't see any marbling in the steak whatsoever. Was not tough, but tougher than my mothers aged NY strip.   The dry aged ribeye wasn't that impressive at all. It was medium rare but still tough. Go figure   The lamb was pretty good. Nice and tender  The filet mignon was close to melt in your mouth, but just not there. It also needed seasoning because it was pretty bland.   The tbone was cooked pretty decently and seasoned well. It was the only steak that had fat on it, which is a plus because it gave it a little extra flavor.   The NY strip was by far the best. And it's kind of ironic because it was cooked medium well. It was the most tender and seasoned steak of all the choices we had to sample.   The chicken was meh. It wasnt dried out, which is a plus, but it wasn't seasoned that much either. The skin was toasted and seasoned, but I guess the seasoning didn't make it's way to the meat.   For the sides, we had the brussels sprouts, the Caesars salad, the mozzarella, potato puree, fingerling potatoes, and mushrooms.   The ones that stuck out the most were the brussels sprouts and the mushrooms. They were both bursting with flavor and I definitely recommend them.   All in all, the steaks we just ok. With so many options in Vegas, I'll probably try somewhere else next time  I believe Dub C. review is pretty spot on.",

We sat a few tables from the entrance, DO NOT SIT THERE!!!! you will have people hovering on the side, in front and behind you. That kind of killed the ambiance. [You're] paying about $150-200 per person only to have someone look over your shoulders to see what the first entree is. I had to tell someone to back up a little because they were just way too close.   the food: It' was really good!!!! We had the Wagyu and Lobster course meal. SOOOOO much food!!! The Cucumber salad, and another salad that had panchetta and bleu cheese dressing were amazing. The beef was really tender. My only issue was that it was pre- cut. i would have liked to enjoy cutting it on my own, Lobster was tender as well. Their butter sauce was sweet, not greasy. Best part was dessert. They had this dense chocolate cake. it was smooth like a truffle but not as sweet. its was amazing!!!  my conclusion: It was over all an amazing experience, with amazing food. But if [you] do go- make sure you sit towards the back of the restaurant. Would I eat here again? Not anytime soon, but maybe again in the future. :)",

Risotto was on point though. And for dessert we had monkey bread, souffle, and we tried all the sorbets they had. Monkey bread was disappointing. Was way too sweet and trust me I love sweets but this was hard to eat. Souffle was grainy we didn't even finish it, but the sorbets were nice and refreshing.

    "text": "Where to begin... I guess I can say this was probably the best steak I've had.  I've been to many high end steakhouses in the Bay Area and this place just tops them all.  I came here with a friend on a Saturday night and got in quickly since we made a reservation online 2 weeks prior to our trip to Vegas.  The place is really high end so dressing more formally would be the right way to go as everyone in the place was dressed up for dinner.  You will definitely not be disappointed with the service as they seemed to come in and check up on us at the right times throughout the meal.  As for the meal, since there was 2 of us, we didn't order everything on the menu but I can tell you we ordered two 16 ounce ribeye steaks cooked medium rare and a side of potatoes au gratin and a side of fries.  Granted we were on vacation, so eating healthy while in Vegas was not on the top of the list.  When the steaks come out, they bring them to you in a separate iron skillet that is hot at first to keep your steak warm while slowly cooking it a little further.  The meat was so tender that cutting into it was like cutting into butter, yummy!!  Taking the first bite, my eyes just lit up as I was experiencing the explosion of beefy flavor in my mouth.  I swear the meat was so tender that you only had to chew it three times before swallowing - now that's how a steak should be.  Since the ribeye is bone-in, it has more flavor as you get closer to the bone, that and it's rare once you get to the bone itself.  During the meal, the conversation died down and mainly revolved of telling each other how good the steak was along with making sounds of joy while eating the incredible food.  As for the side, the au gratin potatoes were excellent and really creamy (artery clogging for sure), and the french fries had the right crunch but was a little on the saltier side for me.  The sides, especially, the fries, are a good portion and will definitely fill you up.  After the meal, our server came by with a desert menu but we were too full to even ponder desert seeing that we couldn't even finish the fries.  Overall, I loved this place and will be coming back in the future as the service was good and the food was amazing.  When all was said and done, our bill came to $138 (not including tip) which is not bad for what we got - great steaks and great service.",

Why? I almost inevitably end up underwhelmed and disappointed. Typically I find that I can cook a better tasting steak at home, and for a whole lot less. Oftentimes even the high end steakhouses have a surprisingly difficult time delivering a steak that is truly medium-rare. Craftsteak is the exception to that \"rule\".  Upon entering the restaurant, you will notice the interior is relatively dark with dim and subdued lighting. The decor is more contemporary and chic than your typical upscale steakhouse.  The service is generally warm and attentive without being overbearing. Ordering a la carte can become very expensive so we typically go with their seasonal prix fixe menu which is served family style.  Bread service consisted of tasty buttered pan rolls, served piping hot.  The appetizers included grilled Vermont farm quail, buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts, shaved fennel, and Persian cucumber with watercress. I enjoyed the first two appetizers. The quail was tender and well seasoned. The latter two were just not my thing, but my dining companions thought they were good.  The entrees were Prime flat iron steak, grilled Angus skirt steak, and Diver sea scallops in a lemon vinaigrette. The 2 steaks were properly cooked to medium-rare, as requested, already presliced, and punctuated with fresh sprigs of thyme. While the flat iron was more tender and the skirt steak more flavorful, both were delicious. The scallops were beautifully caramelized on both sides and very satisfying.  Sides consisted of a small pot of Yukon gold potato puree with chives, organic baby shiitake mushrooms, and Brentwood sweet corn with green onions. For me, the sides are what often distinguishes a truly great steakhouse from a merely good one, and this is where Craftsteak shines. The potato puree is an impossibly decadent concotion of butter, sour cream, and chives. However, as good as it is, I do prefer my potatoes to have a more solid texture. The shiitake mushrooms were excellent as well but for some reason we only received one small serving to share amongst the five of us. With the exception of receiving an additional small plate of the terrific corn, surprisingly they gave us the very same serving sizes of potato puree and mushrooms as in the past when we dined here as a lone couple. Overall, we felt that they skimped on the sides and would have preferred more sides and a bit less beef.  We received 5 desserts of the pasty chef's choice because of the size of our dining party: monkey bread, molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, chocolate panna cotta, peach pavlova, and cheesecake. The monkey bread, topped with cinnamon and nuts and paired with a delicious banana gelato, was my favorite. The molten chocolate cake was nice but could have been a little warmer on the inside. The chocolate panna cotta was a bit too firm but not bad. As for the pavlova, I enjoyed the peach sorbet, but the meringue was a little too thick and hard. The cheesecake was good but not particularly noteworthy.  In the past, I've also sampled the Maine lobster bisque which is absolutely divine, albeit pricey ($18).  Craftsteak is my favorite steakhouse to date. Why only 4 stars? The value, or lack there of. The food is very good, no doubt, but not worth the expensive prices. During Restaurant Week, the $50.10 seasonal tasting menu is a great deal. Outside of RW, it used to be $60 per person not that long ago, but now it is $85 and they eliminated the grilled organic chicken entree and downgraded from American Kobe to Black Angus and Prime. Now I'm more than willing to shell out for food that is spectacular, but $85 pp is simply not worth it for what you are getting. Sorry Tom, that is just too rich for my blood. I'll be back during RW next year when your prices are actually reasonable.",

Their fillet was tough and dry with a strange flavor (medium rare).  Their mushrooms were stale and asparagus was old.  The service was mediocre at best, I felt neglected on water refills.  It was not just the fillet but also the t-bone my wife had.  The T-bone was very thin and tasted very strange, almost a chemical flavor like the solution they used to clean the grill.",

Well worth it, considering the quality and QUANTITY.  Service was great too.  Told them we had tickets for ka ad they were pretty good about keeping the courses coming and even packing and keeping the food for us while we were at the show.    Skirt steak was amazing, much better than the kobe sirloin.  On the show, Collichio always says, \"respect the ingredients.\"  The menu items do just that.  Great examples are the roasted red bell peppers with prosciutto and the spinach.  With each, the natural flavor came through, although the spinach was too salty.  They show a lot of restraint in the sauces and such.  A great steakhouse with more than just the usual pairings...",

    "text": "I have been here twice. First time, halloween night 2008 (Friday Night). I went dressed in a t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops and they let me and my friend in no questions asked (maybe because of lack of business - the place was empty). We sat at the bar.  We had the Prosciutto San Daniele. I guess I was expecting more out of this dish. Its just some (high quality) prosciutto on a plate. no seasoning or garnish or anything. I don't remember my friend's appetizer.  We both had a New York Strip (the regular $44 one, not one of the crazy $100-$250 Wagyu ones). They were beyond excellent, best steak I've ever had. The service was friendly and timely.  2nd Visit:  dec 08 weekend after christmas, Friday Night. I arrived with a total party of 4. We were all dressed casually, in jeans, t-shirts, basketball shoes, etc but it was not a problem. One guy had a hat on and was asked to remove it. We were promptly seated. This time I noticed the restaurant was packed, but there was still no wait even for a party of 4 with no reservation.  Apps: friends ordered the prosciutto san daniele and it was the same as described above from last time. No one at the table was really into it.  I ordered the Hawaiian Prawns, they were excellent.   I had the 16oz Ribeye this time - the regular $44 one, not the expensive kobe style wagyu beef. It was pretty good but not was good as the new york strip from last visit. 3 of us had the Ribeye and one had the Yellowfin Tuna. Everyone liked theirs. One friend said his Ribeye was the best steak he has ever had. The person with the Tuna said it was awesome.  I did not like my side dish, the soft polenta with blue cheese. I love blue cheese so I was excited, but it did not go well with the soft polenta.  The bill for 4 people after tax & tip was $500 and we stayed conservative with our food orders (but had a few drinks each) so watch your wallet.",

When we saw that Tom Colicchio had a steakhouse here, we definitely had this on our to do list while in Vegas.  Customer service was superb!  Thought it was a little odd they had a photographer come around and take photos of you, then sneak up to you right after you get your check and try and charge you an arm and a leg to purchase the photos that were taken of you...The ambience was very neat and modern, one thing I didn't like was where we were sitting, there was a spotlight that was directly over me which made it feel odd, very odd to take photos with a light shining on your head!  Unfortunately, as hard as it is to say, we both weren't impressed with the Top Chef himself!  We both ordered 18oz ribeye, we didn't go for the wagyu cause holy crap was it pricey... the ribeyes were cooked perfectly medium rare, however there was no seasoning, no flavor, it needed the main necessities, salt & pepper.  Sorry Tom, but on this night, with this meal, I would say, Tom, please pack your knives, and go.",

I'd made reservations, but we showed up hungry an hour early, and they sat us at the bar for only about 20 minutes before seating us.   The house bread that comes to the table, some kind of buttered warm King's Hawaiian but better, came to the table, and that was just scrumptious.   We ordered the beets, and that was deliciously prepared.  The beets were fresh and well seasoned. My husband ordered the ribeye done medium rare, and he said it was very very good, among the best steaks he'd ever had.  I had the seared scallops, which were incredible, and I was reminded what it is I like about them so much: so buttery and sweet.   Our server was very friendly and approachable and answered my questions about the menu.  The only person who was a bit cold was the hostess. The decor is nice, understated and masculine as steakhouses usually are.  This is an extremely expensive restaurant, which is why I dropped it a star.  As for dress code, I had called in advance about this, because we had spent the day walking the strip and both wearing jeans.  My husband wore a polo, and they didn't seem to mind this at all.  I would say they didn't seem to notice.",

Craft didn't have the worst food but I left thinking, eh. The decor for the most part is appealing except the portraits of cows lined up on the walls which made me think that I was eating the steak of that cow so I find that to be in bad taste.  The monkey bread dessert was delicious.   The price was typical vegas price--about three times the amount it should be.  Overall.

I paired it with a glass of their syrah which was one of the best glasses of my limited experience.  No one in our group complained and most raved.  For nine people with normal entrees, a few side dishes, and drinks all around the bill came to ~$900 but I imagine most people would spend more.

I went recently with a friend who shares the same love of food as I do..we literally grilled our poor servers with questions like, \"Okay, seriously..what should we get? Whats the best steak? Best potatoes? Whats your favorite\"  After careful consideration, this is what we ate(and if you go..I recommend it all): * I should also note that we shared it all.. including the steak..which was a good call since there were so many things on the menu that looked delicious)  -Lobster Bisque-  really tasty.. not too salty.. nice pieces of lobster.. Creamy but not overly heavy. -Arugula salad- waiter recommended the heirloom tomatoes but since we live in California and get them all the time we chose this.  Good salad. nothing special but a nice way to break up the heaviness of....... -Domestic Wagyu skirt steak..  Amazing. perfectly cooked( we got it medium per the waiters recommendation.. the steak was so tender and marbled it helped keep it together and gave it a nice crust- still very pink inside) The steak had a light sprinkling of sea salt and came already sliced in a jus that was to.die.for. -potato puree- really.. dont even look at the other starch options. Just get this.. trust me it will be the best potatoes you've ever had. -Brentwood corn- I couldn't get enough of this! Someone else's review called it 'crack corn' and I totally agree. -Monkey Bread- Oh yes.. we saved room for dessert and this was worth every bite. In case your not familiar with Monkey Bread( which you can find in the frozen section of Ralphs/vons) Its basically..gooey bread covered with a buttery cinnamon-y caramel sauce.. kinda like a cinnamon roll with out the frosting.. but not really. hmmm..  its just good and you should get it!  -As for drinks I had 2 glasses of wine.. which the sommelier will gladly pair with you meal.. and my friend had 2 cocktails. Total our bill was a little over 200.. Totally reasonable for a memorable meal like this.. plus we got a lot! The portions are generous and very sharable. - I would also note that the wine list was very extensive and well-rounded... everything from 1982 Chateau Margaux to a 40 dollar bottle of Mendoza malbec.. something for everyone! Service was excellent..ambiance was great..bathrooms were clean...Not pretentious but still classy and special.. Hope you stop in and enjoy as much as we did!",

    "text": "After having been to Craft in LA, I was really excited about coming here. I couldn't wait to stuff my face with the finest in red meat and partake in elegant wines. I came here with three friends on a Saturday night as part of our Vegas excess weekend. We got a 10PM reservation and we waited about 15 minutes before being seated. The inside is pretty big and the decor is pretty much what Craft LA looks like - modern with earthy colors, clean lines and warm light. The service was great. The server was able to answer all of our questions and the sommelier came by when we had questions about wine.  The bread they served at the start was hot, fresh, buttery, and sweet. It reminded me of Kings Hawaiian sweet rolls. It didn't need butter, but if you wanted to slather some on for good measure, it was there. We ordered a bottle of red wine and settled in for the meal. I don't remember which red wine we got, but it was very smooth and went well with our meal.  We started with the warm frisee salad with bacon and egg. It is one of the most decadent salads I've eaten. The warm egg coated everything in a creamy blanket as you mixed up the salad and the savory crispy bacon punched through as you ate everything together. If salads were always like this, I would eat it every day.  For the main course, I got the 12 oz. domestic wagyu skirt steak, medium. Two of my friends shared the 32 oz. dry aged porterhouse, and my other friend got the surf and turf. We also ordered sides of spinach and yukon gold puree. Usually at steakhouses, the meat comes out piping hot because the plate is hot like a space shuttle on reentry. Maybe they just don't do that here, or maybe our food was waiting a while for pickup, but my steak was just lukewarm when it arrived. I was a little disappointed. That said, the skirt steak had great flavor, had perfect tenderness, and I ate the whole thing.  I could see my friends that ordered the porterhouse were struggling, and I saw why. It was so massive. I tried a piece, and it had a quick hit of great flavor, but the sheer size of my piece had me munching on it past its flavor burst, like a piece of gum.  The sides of spinach and yukon gold puree were tasty too, but also, for some reason, were not very hot when they came out.  We didn't get dessert because we were so full, and we didn't want to feel like beached whales.  Overall, it was an awesome time with great friends and great food. My only gripe was the temperature of the food when it came out. It might seem like a nitpick, but having your food nice and hot when it arrives makes a big difference.",

It's even better than the steak (in my opinion). Also, don't miss the grits. I know, that seems like an odd thing to say, but they are one of the best side dishes. If they offer the price fixed menu, go for that. It's an incredible value and you'll have the opportunity to try 3 different salads, a main, and 3 different sides (all of which are on the regular menu). It's a nice way to splurge without going totally broke and you'll be more apt to try a side or a salad that you wouldn't otherwise go for at full price. Plus, the desserts are something special. I highly recommend putting this on your list of places to try.",

We started off with cocktails: a Macallan 18 for him, a Blanton's on the rocks for me. My bourbon came with a single massive ice cube. So classy!  We had the beet salad and roasted red pepper salad to start. I pigged out on the warm rolls they served while my husband wisely abstained to save room for steak. I ordered the filet mignon, the husband got some strip steak. We shared bites and groaned. The meat was so delicious - peppery and tender. Our side was the au gratin potatoes, which were...you guessed it...really good. I have a way with words.  The only reason I'm giving this place four stars is because we both felt  that it's overpriced for what it is. We both agreed the steak was perfect, but it wasn't the best piece of steak either of us had ever had.  But what you're really paying for is Colicchio's name, and it was an experience we're both happy to have had.",

    "text": "The problem with Las Vegas culture is that the level of service or friendliness you receive is probably based on one's perception of your \"high roller\"-ness. Unless you look like the type that sweats dollars out of your pores, you can probably expect a level of mediocre service in Vegas on par with the waiters at a Chinatown dive where you have to ask the waiter for water 5 times before you even get it.   You don't pay $60+ an entree at a steakhouse on the mere fact that it tastes good (at least no self respecting person should). When you're eating at a fine steakhouse you're paying a premium for the experience and service as well. While this place appeared destined for success like we had an '11' at the blackjack table... we ended up hitting and drawing a 5. The service was horrible.  In addition, the girlfriend and I both ordered the kobe beef filets. But how on earth did two identical menu items come out tasting so different. Mine tasted exactly how I liked it, savory, tender, with a touch of smokiness. My girlfriend's on the other hand tasted more like charred fat.  Oh, Tom Colicchio, you would've failed Restaurant Wars on your own show.",

    "text": "I never write online reviews and generally I am not too critical about food or eateries, but my recent experience at this gourmet restaurant compelled me to post one.  We had a party of 12 on a Friday night around 8:15PM looking for a good place to eat near our hotel.  Surprisingly, Craftsteak was able to accommodate us without a reservation.  Emeril's wouldn't have been able to seat us until after 9pm.  Our party came from all reaches of the US - California, New York and Texas.  Needless to say, we had some steak aficionados at our table.  While our waiters were fairly attentive, we did have to ask for bread to accommodate a diabetic at our table.  Our orders were taken and then we waited....and waited....and waited.  A few of us ordered a soup or salad to wet the taste buds, but for the rest of us at the table the main course took over 1 hour and 10 minutes to arrive.  As a Top Chef fan, I believe if Tom Colicchio were judging his own restaurant as harshly as he does in restaurant wars, his would not have done well.  The time between courses was unacceptable for a restaurant supposedly of this caliber, especially for the price you pay.  Our waiter only said to us once, \"your food will be out soon,\" placing warm plates in front of us that soon became cold.  The steak was indeed very good, but some of the other dishes were less appetizing.  We had scallops, a few (3 out of 5) were rubbery - something they always criticize on the show.  I was excited to see white corn grits on the menu but asked they make it without bacon, in efforts to be a good Catholic for Lent.  Perhaps that small request made the biggest difference because it came out way too salty and as one of my Texas friends and grits expert said, \"it tasted like cement or medicine.\"    Again, I usually do not feel the need to write reviews on restaurants, but our overall experience here (taking into account the food, cost, wait time and expectations) compelled me to share our collective thoughts.",

    "text": "So glad I had a chance to try Craftsteak.  The good parts:  Setting is fabulous, very posh and yet comfortable.  The Parker house rolls were so good that I ate way too many.  Crusty tops with salt and pillowy soft insides.  The Wagyu beef tartare was as good as others here have said.   And yet...  The frisee salad was majorly overdressed.  Yes, it is a warm salad so the frisee won't be as crisp as normal.  But the egg, bacon, and cheese used for the freshly tossed dressing should have been used on three times the amount of greens.  Then it would have been an enhancement instead of glops of saltiness that hid the taste of the greens.  So sad.  I'm sure Chef Colicchio didn't know it was that way because, after watching him so long on Top Chef, he would not have stood for it.  Wish I had been hungrier so I could have tried other items.    On a side note:  All throughout my dining in Vegas I was confronted with soup spoons given to me for my dessert course.  When the sorbet scoops are the same size as the spoon I'm to eat them with it is not a good match.  Craftsteak was one of the offenders.  Find smaller spoons for diners to use for dessert please!",

    "text": "It is with a heavy heart that I give Craftsteak two stars.  Part of it was expectations, and part of it is the actual experience.  Expectations: Top-notch service, tasty food, atmosphere, advice on wine.  Expectations met on... atmosphere and wine.  The Malbec that the sommelier recommended was really and truly delicious.    Expectations not met on... service or food.  The appetizers (scallops!) and the lobster were fantastic, but this is Craftsteak.  I expected out-of-this-world steak, and we were sorely disappointed.  The ribeye we got must've been a bad cut, because the best word I can think of is 'grisly.'  Points to the staff because when we mentioned it, they did take a little off the bill.  I would've rather gotten a bite of good ribeye, but whatevs.  The dessert was awesome.  If I go again, I'll have an appetizer and dessert!  The service started out like any high-end dining experience, but then things got weird.  We got a sort of family style four-course meal that included multiple appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts.  It's a little annoying to have three entrees brought out at once - for two people.  We couldn't possibly eat everything while it was hot, so that was LAME.  We felt this way on every course - we couldn't enjoy and take our time, we had to stuff our face before stuff got cold.  Our server also mysteriously disappeared after the orders were taken until the meal was over.    We actually refilled our own wine glasses.  After waiting about 10 minutes to see if the server would be back (as expected at high-end places, or am I off-base?).  When they were nowhere to be found, we took matters into our own hands.  I can't say I'll be back anytime soon - there are so many great restaurants in Vegas!  I would skip Craftsteak.",

I brought a Bachelorette party here for dinner and though it is a loud restaurant we were a bit too loud for it. Its quite a big space to accommodate for both large and small groups.   As a vegetarian I was excited to try multiple \"sides\" on the menu. Everyone else order some form of steak or seafood and love it. We had great service and our glasses (wine, champagne or water) were never less than half full. I wish I could tell you more about the rest of the menu but I can only speak for the vegetables. My favorite was the beet salad as the pickled egg was unique. My second favorite was the assortment of mushrooms simply because they were each unique in flavor and basically left alone. I would have really like a sauce of some sort to eat with the fingerling potato and asparagus however. The general team of the sides were too simply for me to say I loved it. Living in Chicago, I have had great side dishes at steak restaurants and I am kind of indifferent about these.   Overall service and atmosphere was 5 stars but the veggie dishes were 2. I guess I just expected more out of Tom Colicchio in all aspects of the menu.",

    "text": "So we just completed our week at Vegas and tried 3 different restaurants with the Ribeye, so the rating is a comparison of the three.  We we walked right in at 6:30 and immediately greeted not by one waiter, but two.  We were explained the wine list and specials and began to pick our food.  A third waitress continued to fill our waters regularly.  It was not too busy at 6:30, but by 7:30, the place was full and service slowed down a little, but still top notch.  For soup, we went with the Lobster Bisque and the salad was the Italian Buffalo Mozzarella Salad.  Both very delicious appetizers and would recommend a must have.  The main entrees were the Ribeye with Risotto and the Filet Mignon with Asparagus.  Now don't get me wrong, the expectation is high at this price point and they did not disappoint on flavor.  The reason for three stars was the amount of gristle that the Ribeye had.  I would say about half of the slab was very difficult to get through and some pieces just had to go down the throat without breaking it up into pieces with my teeth.  The Risotto was also just OK, it needed more flavor.  It also comes in a big bowl, way too much for two people.  We only got through 25% of it.  To compare, we went to Mon Ami Gabi and Gordan Ramsey Steakhouse.  You'll have to search those for my reviews.  On a side note, when does business casual actually get enforced?  Two of the three resturaunts at this level we attended, both had people in t-shirts and Tom's had a guy with shorts and a t-shirt.  IMO, It kinda brings down the atmosphere for those of us who understand rules.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Top Chef, so I was very excited to try head judge Tom Collichio's restaurant!  We were seated at a nice booth with a view of the restaurant.  Our server was very attentive and helpful in explaining the menu and offering suggestions.    We started with the lobster bisque ($18) and the warm frisee salad ($16) with bacon and champagne vinaigrette.  The lobster bisque had large chunks of fresh lobster and had a nice creamy finish.  The best part of the frisee salad were the chunks of smoked bacon, but it was really heavy as the bacon was quite fatty and the vinaigrette very oily and collected at the bottom of the bowl.    We ordered the 22 oz roasted T-bone steak ($56), 18 oz grilled angus bone-in ribeye and diver scallops ($39) for our entrees.  The scallops were quite tender and had a bit of crust on the top, but overall were a little undercooked.  The T-bone steak and ribeye were cooked perfectly, but lacked a bit in flavor and tenderness.  The sides were the best part of the actual entree experience.  We really enjoyed the mushroom medley, broccoli sauteed in olive oil and garlic, yukon gold potato puree and potatoes au gratin.   The cinnamon monkey bread with brown sugar sour cream ice cream ($15) was sweet, buttery and utterly delicious.  The vanilla bean cheesecake ($13) was just okay, nothing special.     Overall, if you are looking for a steakhouse restaurant, I would pick STK over Craftsteak.  The shrimp rice krispies bisque with tiger prawns at STK was superior in flavor and creaminess to the lobster bisque at Craftsteak.  The bone in filet mignon at STK was more tender and flavorful compared to the T-bone steak and bone in ribeye at Craftsteak.  Craftsteak has many higher end options for types of steak (Wagyu, Kobe, etc), but you pay the price for them.  Even though the music gets really loud at STK, I would rather eat there for the money than Craftsteak any day.",

    "text": "Yelp really needs a 1/2 star increment, because this place deserves 4.5 stars.  I have to admit, I don't watch Top Chef, don't know who Tom Colicchio is other than lots of ppl made a fuss about him.  Still, I enjoyed my experience here...  Atmosphere is accessible, and feels like a welcome respite from the ridiculousness occuring just outside its doors at the MGM Grand.  But you're not here for that reason...  You're here for some oustanding steak.  Craftsteak is proud to explain the difference between Angus, Grade 7 Wagyu beef, and Grade 10 Wagyu beef.  Served simple, medium rare, and with little to get in the way of the flavor and texture of what may be the best steak I ever had (I did the grade 7 Wagyu - awesome).  One more thing - dessert included a chocolate torte with bacon ice cream.  I'm an instant believer.  Only knock on this place -- we went with the table-wide 3 course prix fixe.  Grade 7 Wagyu with lobster was $155/person (does not include drinks).  While it offered more options in appetizers, steak (we could sample across the NY Strip, filet, and ribeye), the portions were larger than they needed to be, and the quantity of dessert served was just plain obnoxious and felt a bit wasteful.  Still, if you want an amazing steak experience, give Craftsteak a try!",

    "text": "Recommended by our buddies Mark and My, Janette went here to celebrate a bunch birthday/graduation/early anniversary.  We ordered the Wagyu Prixe Fix.... and wow do they give you a ton of food, especially for 2 people.  Buffalo Mozzarella - pretty good... slightly gamey tasting, comparable to a goat cheese flavorwise, but not as pungent or creamy. The red peppers really brought out a nice flavor to the cheese.  Caesar Salad - nothing really spectacular about this, other than it being a standard Caesar with ultra fresh ingredients. If you like anchovies like I do, you'd probably want a couple more.  Wagyu Carpacio - excellent. Wagyu carpacio with a quail egg in the middle. This was insanely tender and flavorful, and went well with the crusty bread.  Avocado Salad - also amazing... what stood out were the onions and cucumbers which were a perfect sweet and sour, which aided in complimenting the creaminess of the avocado.  Roasted Corn - the server said this would be the best side... and I agree. This was amazing... perfectly roasted, sweet, and just the texture... crunchy poppy...   Chive Potato Puree - too salty. a lot of butter which is normally good but it was definitely over slated. This makes me sad only because I love chives and potatoes. I still inhaled it though.  Mushroom Assortment - this was OK... a good assortment of mushrooms that had a variety of textures and flavors that ranged from very woody to chewy. Maybe i expected portabellos...  Wagyu Filet - not gonna lie... this was incredibly tender, and you could really notice that there was a higher fat content in this than typical filets by the way the flavor was retained. Perfectly cooked rare to our (my)_ liking. And like most good steaks, the seasoning was simple.  Wagyu Ribeye - surprisingly leaner than i expected, considering I've had my share of great steaks. I was expecting this to have tons more fat equating to tons more flavor. This is the first time I prefered the filet over the rib eye. I also realized that I may prefer aged rib eyes as well.  Monkey Bread - very similar to what Janette makes, with the only difference being that the dough was less dense.   Apricot and Citrus Sorbet - another great dessert to cut the richness of the dishes. A good amount of citrus acidity and flavor  Strawberry shortcake (modern take/deconstructed). very interesting take, with the rice crispy adding a great textural flavor. The strawberry ice was refreshing but had a slight amount of bitterness. This also cut the richness from the meal.  Assorted seasonl fruits - plane jane stuff. All were sweet. nothing really spectacular but still also a refreshing end.  Overall the meal was great... a lot of highs and a few disappointments. Pricewise, you're actually getting a good deal for Wagyu in comparison with their Angus, as Wagyu can run twice as much, and you're only paying about a 20 dollar difference per steak. The service was spectacular and the ambiance was great.",

I've had Kobe beef in Kobe, Japan, and the freshest beef in the world outside Rio in Brazil. Both of these experiences had the meat as the showcase, no more flavoring added then the sear of the grill and some salt. Having enjoyed such great beef, I find it best just NOT to get my hopes up again, and not bother with steaks at restaurants (to much disappointment). We went to Craftsteak for a Vegas style birthday. The weekend was already filled with amazing food adventures, but they all culminated in a great dinning experience thanks to our favorite Top Chef.  The dinning room, although dim and buzzing with waiters and busboys was never so loud I couldn't talk across the table to our party of 9. The sommalia was great at helping us settle on several wines for the table, one of which he comped (with out us knowing till the bill came) for the birthday girl! Our waitress was all sunshine with out being annoying, and our food came out quick. I had the surf and turf, New York tri with a lobster tail cooked Medium. AMAZING!! Simple, a good size on both the tail and the steak! My friend got the Rib-Eye...IT WAS MASSIVE, so juicy and simple. The side dishes aren't really worth mentioning, because here, the steak was front and center. The table played pass-the-piece and we tried half the menu. Finished the meal off with coffee and monkey bread (with candle in it for some happy birthday singing) and you could have stuck a fork in me, I was done!  From the hostess, to the bill, Craftsteak delivered the total dinning experience and made me believe that I don't have to eat the extreme A+ in steak, there is plenty of room for the \"regular\" A's at the top of the curve as well!",

Service was top notch, and everything from A to Z was perfect. The presentation of their food is a major plus as well. Having Silver Oak by the glass? Also extra points. Wonderful restaurant.",

    "text": "I ate here last weekend with two of my male friends. We had a reservation for Saturday at 10pm. Tip #1: Don't make a reservation for 10pm in Vegas. I started the drinking day at 8am with a bloody mary, so by the time our dinner started I was beginning my 14th consecutive hour of drinking.  I have the receipt next to me, so I'm just going to walk through it item by item:  2 Miller Lite - $12: I swear to God I had no memory of us ordering two Miller Lites until I read it on the receipt just now. Clearly, despite the incredibly high quality of this restaurant, their Miller Lites are less than memorable.  6 oyster, daily - $24: I am responsible for ordering this completely unnecessary appetizer. None of us are even all that crazy about oysters, though I did enjoy them.  1 Glass Pinot Noir - $17: One of my friends got this. I didn't try any of this $17 wine, but I'm guessing it wasn't as good as three Miller Lites or four oysters.  1 Arugula - $13: This salad was ordered by the same dude who ordered the wine. At this point in the meal, he's easily our table's frontrunner for \"most proper diner\" with wine and salad. I'm in second with a Miller Lite and oysters, while my other friend is nursing a Miller Lite and looking as though he is about to hurl.  Bread - $0: This is not on the receipt, but it is worth mentioning. We tore into this bread like Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman eating that weird melon in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (Wait, what? You don't get this reference?). This bread was so damn good. Granted, we had been drinking for over half a day and intentionally starving ourselves since \"we are going to Craftsteak later!! wooo!!\" Our bread destruction is how I know the service was top notch. We tore through the bread in--I shit you not--30 seconds per plate, and got through four plates of it. Yet, each time, our server had a new plate of fresh bread waiting for us almost instantly.  2 Potato Gratin - $28: This was poorly played by us. When two of you are going to drop $14 on simple potato sides, you should probably diversify. At least the portion was very large, and the potatoes did taste good. They actually tasted sort of like Betty Crocker Three Cheese Potatoes except, well, no that's exactly what they tasted like. Only they were $14. C'mon though, you can't just eat a steak on a plate all by itself right? Wrong. You most definitely can. Lay out $14 on the plate next to the steak, and while you are eating decide whether you'd like to exchange that for some Betty Crocker potatoes.  1 Ribeye: $51 1 NY Strip: $48 1 Steak & Lobster: $69 - The steaks really were great. I got the strip, and it was cooked perfectly. Some reviewers were disappointed with theirs, and perhaps it being near 11pm and less crowded allowed for closer attention to be paid to our steaks, but my steak truly was perfect. The filet was good too. I know this because my friend went to the bathroom while there was still some filet left on his plate, so I just picked it up and popped that badboy right into my mouth. Yeah, it was kind of a dick move and, yes, I understand that alcohol shouldn't be an excuse for bad behavior, but I had at this point been drinking for FIFTEEN HOURS.  OVERALL: Great experience, great food, and the total bill ($283.22) wasn't even that bad, though this had a lot to do with how little we were drinking since we were already on the verge of dying.",

    "text": "Craft steak was flawless in every way.  I arrived with my party about 10 mins early just in case there was a wait.  As I sat there I noticed the interior, perfectly classic steak house, wood everything.  Dark oaks, redwoods and even pine.  Aw the faint smell of wood finish is unmistakable and wonderful when you sit down to a hearty meal.  There is just something about the smell of pine and oak that goes with a 12oz steak.  Our server came over to us promptly and introduced himself.  Charm filled the room, every wait staff had a smile ear to ear.   The Floor manager came over next.  We were all dressed in business attire and casual wear, nothing special at all.  After all it was 110 degrees outside so some of us were in shorts.  None of this stopped him from coming over.   He just came over to introduce himself and make sure everything was to our liking.   We started our meal with artisan breads. The favorite of the table was the kalamata rosemary bread. Wonderfully salty and airy, perfect way to get us to drink 2 more cocktails each.  A good restaurateur will understand the need to up sale through cocktails and a good way to do that is salty snacks,  I had the New York strip with Natural Ju and Thyme.   It came sliced into perfect  inch cubes with a  inch fat cap still attached.  All I could think was thank god you kept the fat on there.  I got a side of roasted mushrooms with my steak. I'm a sucker when it comes to mushrooms, especially when they are prepared as simple as possible. They were simply pan roasted in clarified..... also known as liquid gold.  All in All for experience, atmosphere, food and service they get a 5, but when I go into a place like this I expect nothing less then a perfect evening.",

I think it came with 5 cuts (prob about 1 lb per type - filet, ribeye, sirloin, short rib, etc.) and almost all the apps, sides, and desserts.  It was definitely not cheap (~$200pp), but in hindsight I think you could actually order that tasting for 2 people and then get 1-2 other entrees and basically share it with 4 or 5 other people.  I also went back with my family and had a great normal meal there.  The food was cooked perfectly and the service was great.",

    "text": "We were fresh off of a Kitchen Nightmare's marathon, so my roommates and I decided to go give Gordan Ramsay Steak a try, however, they were all booked up. Now with a steak craving that required immediately fulfillment, we headed to Craftsteak.  I'll start by saying the two best things were by far the waitstaff and the break. The waiters were friendly, attentive, and everything came out with perfect timing. The bread was presented adorably and was ridiculously delicious, I knew I had to save room for a big meal coming up, but I legitimately couldn't stop throwing down bread, but it kinda worked out, because there's a reason bread ranks on my top 2 things about Craft.  We went with the Wagyu steak special w seafood for the 4 of us. The seafood dishes were okay, however I couldn't really get myself to eat them, just too odd for my taste(the oysters were ok, though). The steaks themselves were very average imo, and I found myself filling the remainder of my bread ridden belly with the mashed potatoes, which were also great. The other vegetables were pretty undercooked, but to be fair I typically like them extremely tender.  Finally, dessert. This is something I have no complaints over. The monkey bread was literally the sweetest thing I have ever tasted, almost too rich to even keep eating(couldn't stop though, obviously). The chocolate souffle was very rich and delicious, however I only got a bite of that because of my chocolate crazy roommate who ate it within seconds. The blueberry cheesecake was probably near the best cheesecake's I've ever eaten, and the sorbets were very tasty as well. There was a 5th dessert but I'm blanking on what it was.  It was a bit pricey for what we got, however a few things redeem this place to a 3 star for me.",

The service was nice and like most upscale restaurants in vegas.   We also order many other sides. Mushrooms, asparagus, spinach and one other one. They were all great! Maybe a little less salt in the mushrooms though.   Got some bread and bread and butter were good there. the bread was soft and hot when they came out.   The different ways the kobe beefs were cooked and flavored made them super juicy and tender.   I really loved the tar tar! MUST TRY!  Overall a great experience with the family.

I've been to my fair share of steakhouses and I would have to say the balance between great ambiance and food at Craftsteak was really spot on. The restaurant doesn't have the same club-like atmosphere that some steakhouses in Vegas do (STK), but it was certainly busy for a Saturday night and had a fun vibe.   We ordered their special \"chef's selection\" option where a couple gets 3 salads, soup, two entrees, three sides and four desserts for ~$150 a person. Everything we had was amazing - particularly the beef selections we made (Wagyu Filet and Wagyu Ribeye) which tasted like butter. The selection and quality of sides and salads was also great, delicious and somewhat more innovative than your traditional broccoli and potato selections. I really enjoyed the buffalo mozzarella salad and risotto side.  The amount of food we got was more than enough for two people and actually seemed like a pretty good deal given the amount and quality of food we got. My boyfriend and I were completely stuffed by the time dessert came around and had to take some of the snacks to go.  I would definitely return here when back in Vegas - certainly not cheap (ended up costing around $550 for both meals and a nice bottle of wine plus cocktails) but worth the experience.",

    "text": "Was really looking forward to dining at Craftsteak since I have watched Tom Colicchio on several TV shows and had yet to dine at one of this restaurants.   We had a party of 3 and we ate rather late so reservations were not a problem. We were promptly seated when we arrived and were greeted by the waiter right away. When the waiter took our order he was very thorough in describing the menu although he paid special attention to the highest priced steaks which seemed to be a bit of up-selling. My group did not want to roll out of there so we decided to split the 32oz Porterhouse. We ordered individual salads; I had the Roasted Baby Beets which I really enjoyed; one friend had the Caesar Salad which he said was the best Caesar he ever had; my other friends had the Spinach salad which was just Ok. We also ordered sides of White Corn Grits, Hen of Woods Mushrooms, Asparagus and a bottle of red wine, to share.   All items we are were good but all were lacking salt. I asked the waiter for salt and mentioned that I felt everything was under seasoned. The waiter said nothing and brought me a salt shaker. I expected the waiter to take some action based on my comment. Proper seasoning is one of the most important aspects of cooking and for the waiter to discount my comments without any recognition was disappointing.   I will say that the Brown Butter Carrot Cake was outstanding. I would go back for just that desert and to be honest that would be the only reason I would go back.",

With that being said, everything I did order was perfection. Their warm bread with just enough sea salt was an epic way to start out the evening.  I began my delicious journey with the avocado appetizer which was to die for. Most of my colleagues regretted their choices (which were delightful themselves) after tasting mine! It was truly that good. Then came my scallops, which were cooked to sheer perfection. We ordered various side dishes for the table , all of which were excellent. I wish I could name them all, but after endless bottles of Pinot Grigio, the night was a tad fuzzy.  What I do remember crystal clear is what was what I considered \"la piece de resistance\" of the evening. MONKEY BREAD! I dug into that monkey bread like I was making sweet love to it. I forgot if anyone wanted a piece. Quite honestly, I did not care. It was ooey gooey, crunchy, warm, sweet, decadent, naughty and oh so wicked. It was bliss. Eventually I was forced to pass it around, but I probably ate most of it.   I love you, Monkey Bread.",

One table mate started with two of every kind of oyster on the menu and thoroughly enjoyed them.   When the steaks arrived, 3 out of the 4 were tepid and one that was ordered rare was medium at best. We understand the concept of letting steaks rest, but these were napping on the job. We were in a time crunch so we didn't complain too much, but they brought another rare steak out. Sides were ok.   We all looked at each other after and agreed that it was a bit of a letdown. Oh well, live and learn. Hopefully you learn from this and go to a better steakhouse if you're in Vegas.

It was a Thursday night, no reservations, and we were seated right away. The area we were seated was a rather bit odd. I think we were actually seated in the bar's lounge area. I didn't really mind but it definitely was not the general dining area.  Anyway, straight to business - my SO and I started with the charcuterie platter ($24). It came with a snazzy dish of different mustards which I didn't really care for. The charcuterie platter came with your typical salumi, soppressata (sp?), headcheese, etc. It was nothing to write home about; although the soft pretzels that accompanied it was very nice.   For our main, we both had the dry-aged NY strip steak ($48) with cauliflower ($9) and French fries ($13). The steaks were cooked the way we requested and the side dishes were generous portions.   For dessert, I decided to be adventurous and order the maple bacon ice cream. It was kind of icky. If someone had told me it was butter pecan, I would've thought it was a very \"buttery\" butter pecan flavor. However, I knew it was bacon AND there were bacon bits in it so I couldn't really wrap my head around it.  All in all, a good experience but definitely came with a hefty price tag (wine included). If anything, I just wanted to check it off my list and say that I've been!",

Despite its unassuming presence on the somewhat exhaustive menu, it's definitely a must try. It reminds me of a carb-less carbonara pasta minus (some of) the guilt. (Tip: Ask for the poached egg on top and have them mix it in). It was just heavenly.   Craftsteak is definitely one of  the best restaurants in Vegas.",

We made our reservations at 6:30pm and were promptly seated.  First impression of the steakhouse environment, it is very intimate.  The colors, designs, and furniture were all very warm and inviting.  However, the dining table was rather interesting.  It is a large square slab -- too large to be honest.  My wife sat on one end and I sat on the other.  In order to communicate, we felt we had to \"yell\" out for the other to hear us.  After 5 minutes, we decided to sit \"together\" on one side.  Throughout dinner, since people had to speak up, we could hear the conversations on either side of our table.  This was not very intimate.  Upon being seated, because we came early, it was not busy.  About 6 waiters converge on a central plate area chit chatting.  We waited for a good 20 minutes, no waiter, now water, no orders were taken.  Finally, we hailed a bus boy requesting our waiter.  He promptly came, named Blass, took our orders and left.  Throughout the dining experience, a group of bus boys and a different server brought our dinner.  Not once were we asked about our dining experience or whether we need additional water or menu items.  I had to hail our waiters a couple times to refill my water.  Unreal.    Even worst, both tables on either side of us had the same complaints.  I had no idea what our waiter was doing; but, he was definitely not doing his job.  As for the food, we ordered the following:  1.  Appetizers       -- Lobster Bisque -- this was recommended by a friend.  The texture and aroma            was perfect.  It had a lightness to it and flavor was good.  However, it needed          major salt      -- Scallops -- They were plump.  And, presentation was nice.  However, it lacked               flavor.  It was not juicy and tasted kinda dry.  This could have been done                               better.  2.  Entree #1       -- Striped Bass -- this was the worst dish possible.  My wife was very upset.  The bass was NOT fresh.  For 30+ dollars, this dish was a waste.  The reason why we know that it was not fresh was that the fish was not flaky.  Instead, it was extremely sticky and tasted OLD.  This was inexcusable.  Of course, we tried to track our waiter down, but he never showed up.     3.  Entree #2       -- Short Ribs.  This was Tom's signature dish.  It was very tender and very good.  Flavor could have been better with salt; but, overall, we were not disappointed  4.  Drinks -- We ordered a couple Raspberry Martini's -- these were excellent.  Usually, I tip between 20-25%.  When I received the bill, I was tempted to put zero.  However, because the bus boys did a good job, I could not penalized them for the lack of service by the waiter.  Dinner for two was about $225 with tip.  Here are my ratings:  1.  Environment - good ambiance, however, dining table was a major issue.  When having an intimate dinner, you do not need to be able to hear your neighbor's discussion -- 3 stars  2.  Waiter -- service was horrible --- Zero stars  3.  Hostess and Bus Staff - they saved the night for us.  They were polite and prompt - 5 stars  4.  Meal -- the meal was at best ~ average.  For a high dining restaurant, you expect better quality for the PRICE.  - 2 stars  Overall, we would rate this as a low 2 stars.  Obviously, we were not pleased.  As a regular diner to many of Las Vegas's finest restaurants, we most likely would not return.  We do hope that their management fix the service issue.  We were sorely disappointed and would not recommend dining here.  Thank you.",

    "text": "You honestly don't even need to read this review, but instead just know this: My experience at Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak was one of the best I've ever had: anywhere.  Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  Quick and knowledgeable, even though the place was absolutely packed on a Friday night. No complaints here. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  This is tough, considering my party essentially ordered an all-you-can eat, four course feast. Can you put an acceptable price on all-you-can-eat dining of the highest quality? No, but Craftsteak decided it amounted to about $200 per person including drinks. That's high. Very high, but not only is this Vegas, but it's a restaurant inside a hotel, let alone the MGM. To be completely honest? I'm usually a sticker when it comes to overpriced luxury food, but this was so good that I can't complain. It's Vegas: treat yourself. Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  I will be the first to say that I have no appreciation whatsoever for fine dining, especially when it comes to steak, but this was some of the best food I've ever had. From the fantastic rolls to the appetizers ranging from peppers to prawns, the meal was made even better by the various cuts of meat and breathtaking dessert. Dual Stars Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I would, without question, eat here every day if I could afford it, but I'll pump the breaks here just because, at the end of the day, you really are overpaying based on the atmosphere and the high price point set by Vegas dining. No Star Granted.",

    "text": "A restaurant with a great ambiance, perfect to that special lady in your life.   The food was good, nothing to write home about.  Sadly the rolls were the most memorable part of my meal.    The service seemed a little lacking throughout the meal however the end of my meal triggered me to write this review.  I never write reviews unless I am blown away by a great meal (service, food, ambiance etc) or I want management to open management's eye to something I thought needed their attention.  Like I said, the service was not excellent, we never felt welcomed by the 3 people who approached our table and our server was very flat.  He could have been having a bad day so whatever, I was able to brush that off.  However at the end our meal, my date wanted to take the leftovers back to our hotel.  The server asked us if we wanted the food boxed.  Right when we said yes, he stacked all the plates on top of each other while all the food was still there.  Everything was getting squished and considering that the bottom of the plate is probably the dirtiest area, it was quite disgusting.  After boxed food arrived we paid and threw it away outside.  There was no way we were going to eat that later on.  How disappointing.    Made me leave the restaurant with a bad taste in my mouth.",

    "text": "My husband and I were quite excited to dine at this highly rated restaurant, but overall we were disappointed. We ordered a couple cocktails, which were nice, but nothing special, and I was pleased with their wine selection. My husband had oysters, which were excellent, but my spinach salad was basically a plate full of enough greens for like 4 people with a few small pieces of peaches and walnuts sprinkled on top. The most disappointing part of the meal was the actual steak. Since we like New Yorks, I ordered the dry aged NY and he got the A5 Wagyu NY so we could compare meats. One was grilled and the other baked in the oven, but both were flavorless and tough as nails. Mine had such a large piece of gristle running through it, that I literally did not have the strength to slice through it. The pieces I did manage to cut were still fatty and tough to chew. I ended up leaving 2/3 of it on the plate. My husband's was only slightly better...easier to cut, but still tough and little flavor. We ordered the potato puree, the heirloom cauliflower and the seasonal corn, all three of which we loved...and thank goodness we could fill up on those since the steak was so awful.   I've been to enough high end steak houses to know a great steak and these barely qualified as mediocre. I should point out that the service was excellent, from the hostess all the way through the servers. But $400 later, I was wishing we'd have grabbed a burger and went gambling instead. We will not be returning to Crafsteak.",

Our first course was lobster bisque. It had huge pieces of lobster and tasted so rich and creamy. Next was kobe tartare with little crostini served alongside grilled hawaiian prawns. The tartare had a raw egg yolk on top and tasted very rich yet refreshing. The prawns were soooo sweet and flavorful. I've never had better shrimp. Our server also gave us an extra appetizer of cesar salad with whole anchovies. For the main course, we had rib eye and ny steak. Both were top quality and were incredible with the sides of corn, sauteed mushrooms and the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. For dessert, we had three different items: a fruit plate with peach sorbet and strawberry sorbet, a molten chocolate cake with mint ice cream, and a cinnamon monkey bread with banana ice cream (my favorite). This was one of our most memorable meals.",

First out was our soup and salad course that went very well with the butter rolls..yum!  Soup was lobster bisque with 3 variation of salads.  If you do not eat large meals, I would suggest taking it easy during your first course even though you will want to eat all of it.  We chose the surf and turf for our second course that included a Wagyu skirt steak, a Wagyu ribeye, and a 2 lb lobster.  The steaks are served med rare, and are absolutely outstanding cuts.  The lobster was slightly overcooked, but still pretty good.  Our second course came with 3 family style sides.  Asparagus, gratin potatoes, and an assortment of mushrooms.  Again, all three were delicious.  Third course topped it off.  They gave us two scoops of ice cream with one being a pistaccio flavor, and the other I forgot.  We also had a variety of nicely cut up fresh fruit.  The third plate of dessert had a chocolate bar of some sort and another ice cream scoop.  Since it was our birthday, we received a plate of their monkey bread with MORE ice cream.  SO, now you know why it was so hard to walk away from food on our plates.  $160 per person.  You can dress up or go casual.  Either way it is cool.  Enjoy!",

Next to Harris' Steakhouse in the City, this place is one of the best! The steaks are amazing and be sure to try the Bison! They have some phenomenal accoutrement for your main course as well. I recommend you have the Hen of the Woods Mushrooms and Jerusalem Artichokes. The wine list is extensive and really expensive but there are some real gems for about the $110.00 a bottle mark. Check out the 05 Gamba \"Old Vine\" Zinfandel, it pairs perfectly with beef dishes and tastes heavenly on its own. The service is impeccable. You'll have a server and at least two other people helping your party at any given time. Their attention to detail is superb and well worth the price. The ambiance is a steakhouse but still Vegas (a little over the top but sometimes its nice to go over the top).",

    "text": "Fantastic experience this Labor Day Sunday!  Now it's a little sneaky of them not to offer the Restaurant Week/Seasonal Chef's Menu on their printed menu nor even mention it when discussing specials, but I won't fault them for trying to make some hard needed cash off the masses.  The menu was phenomenal!  As previously discussed we had 4 appetizers (fennel salad, persian cucumber salad, buffalo mozzarella with toasted hazelnut, and roasted quail with vincotto).  All were delicious and sorely needed since I hadn't had a vegetable in 2 days.  Then we had the flat iron and skirt steaks as well as diver sea scallops.  The scallops tasted super FRESH.  The steaks were butter tender and well seasoned.  All were swimming in tasty pan sauce.  The sides were a wonderfully smooth potato puree, OK roasted shitakes, and sauteed sweet corn.  I think the sweet corn was my favorite.  My grandma makes a Chinese corn dish that is really similar.  Scallions, really sweet corn, and I tasted some soy, methinks.  The desserts were just OK, although at this point I was so full I don't know if I can fairly judge.  We were going for total indulgence and this place fit the bill.  Talk about overkill.  12 dishes for 2 people???  I think they may give the same amount if you come with 2 people as opposed to slightly larger parties.  Just excellent.  Enough gushing.  Go here.",

I actually ordered the rib-eye, which was delicious, but my husband, at our server's suggestion, ordered the skirt. I wasn't too sure about skirt steak at such a fine steakhouse, and was shocked to learn how good it can be. We were actually blessing the cow. I ended up leaving (sadly) more than 14 oz's of my 16 oz rib-eye behind cause I couldn't get enough of the moist, flavorful, amazing, melt-in-your-mouth tender wagyu skirt steak. Yummmo!!!! The mashed potato puree and roasted corn, also amazing. We've eaten here several times, and have always been impressed. The service is impeccable, the ambiance is relaxed and cool, the blue-cheese olive martinis are to-die-for, the dinner rolls are sooo yummy...I could go on... After one bite, I was no longer disappointed that we couldn't get reservations at Prime...which is also great, but not any greater than Craft, unless of course you want a more stuffy-elegant experience.",

We chose Craftsteak because of its \"Top Chef \" reputation, and figured that it would be well worth price. It was a disaster from the very beginning. Even though we had a reservation, when we arrived we were told that it would be a 20 minute wait. 20 minutes turned into 30, and then 45! Finally, after complaining, we were seated. We ordered our appetizers and meals, and our appetizers were brought out (which is the only reason I have given this restaurant 1 star). After waiting and waiting and waiting for our entrees, the waiter carried the tray out, only to drop it all over the floor merely a few feet from us. Now I realize that accidents happen, but after the fiasco no one even bothered to come to our table to address the issue. After waiting for our waiter  to come talk to us, we asked for a manager. The manager didn't even bother to show. Finally when the waiter DID return he said they would have to recook our meals, and it would be \"just a while longer\". No one offered to comp ANYTHING. After telling him how displeased we were with the experience so far, he told us that if we wanted to leave we were welcome to. So that is exactly what we did. I will NEVER even consider walking into that restaurant again.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying the kobe strip steak I had here is one of the top 3 pieces of meat i've ever had in my life.  We had the kobe prix fixe menu which includes a kobe steak and sides for everyone at the table, salads and appetizers for the table, and dessert.  The salads and appetizers were good.  Simple light salads, that were the perfect start to an enormous meal.  The steaks were phenomenal.  We tried the kobe filet, kobe strip, kobe rib-eye and the braised short ribs.  Suprisingly the kobe strip was the winner.  I can't stress how great this steak was.  Juicy, buttery, tender, it was as close to perfect as you can get.  The other steaks were also fantastic, but the strip was the clear favorite of the table.  Sides that came with dinner were great too, potatoes, greens, typical food done very well.  Deserts were also a highlight of the night.  All 6 of them that were included with our mean for FOUR people.  The portions here are generous, the food great, and the service was also outstanding.  If you're looking for one of the best steaks you've ever had, I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Simply amazing.  Four of us ate here for our nice night out in Vegas.  We were not disappointed at all.  Very nice, calming decor.  The service was great - we had no less than 4 people working our table.  We started with martinis for everyone while our server explained the different cuts and options to ordering.  We decided on a 3 course tasting menu for all.  I loved that the food was served family style as we all wanted to try everything.  First course was Caesar salad, frisee salad with a poached egg on top, grilled shrimp and a buffalo mozzarella salad - all yum.  Next came our main course, with 4 cuts of beef, corn sauteed in brown butter, mashed potatoes and 4 types of sauteed mushrooms.  I wasn't quite as impressed with the sides (with the exception of the mushrooms), but the steaks were perfectly cooked and soooo tasty - perfect with the bottle of sangiovese we had selected.  The dessert course was completely overwhelming - 6, yes, SIX, desserts were brought to our table.  We tried everything and it was very good.  Highlights was the monkey bread with caramel sauce and banana ice cream.  The dark chocolate tart came with maple bacon ice cream that was fun to try.  Also on the sorbet sampler was a pineapple cayenne sorbet with a serious bite.   All in all, the great meal that we were looking for and well worth the money.",

But the steak is not my complaint about this place. I am all for paying high prices for a fancy feast, I mean If I go to Vegas and act like a high roller I should spend and eat like a high roller. But what i dont understand is why no sides come with your meal? So you are telling me that i can pay 184 dollars (!)  for some Kobe yum yum but you aint gonna throw in any potatoes or asparagus!?!? I get that you are high end, but what is the deal in this day and age of charging someone 15 dollars for a side of asparagus, and 15 dollars for a side of potatoe/leek au gratin? So yes this was an incredible meal, taste was amazing, but c'mon you cant sell your plates with ONE choice of side.. for goddsakes Black angus and Outback give you a side! no add on soup or salad... thanks Craftsteak for treating us like the very meat you so tenderley cook...",

    "text": "Hands down best steak ever.......and it should have been.  When I go to Vegas I don't mess around when it comes to food.  I try and enjoy myself as much as I can really at whatever price that may be.  You only live once so you damn well better enjoy the food you eat. This was defintely the most expensive meal I've ever had but again was probably by far the best.  I did the Chef's Tasting of the Waygu beef, the Platinum level.  Its the most expensive thing on the menu.  It seems like a lot of money and not to say that it isn't but considering I could easily lose the same amount gambling in 1/4 of the time, it makes the meal well worth it.  I believe the chefs tasting was a 5 or so course meal and every course was delicious, the worst part was the chocolate souffle at the end but by that time I had enough and I wouldn't have expected anything to taste all that great at that point.  (So I dont want to say it was necessarily bad).  I'd definitely recommend getting the steak done no more than medium rare, generally anyone that knows anything about steak will tell you the same thing, this allows the steak to stay the most tender.  The main course of this tasting was a filet and a rib eye.  Generally I love rib eyes, not a big fan of filets since they are one of the least flavorful pieces of steak since they are so low in fat.  Well both pieces were absolutely amazing and while I'd still say the rib eye was better the filet was better than any other steak I've had anywhere else and that says a lot.  So the bottom line is if you want to splurge for yourself for a special occasion or just because this is one place I'd definitely recommend with confidence.",

    "text": "-------------------------------------------------- ESSENTIAL TIPS & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: -------------------------------------------------- # Craftsteak is in MGM Grand. Follow the signs to Wet Republic and the floor will change from carpet to smooth concrete. It's on your right, next to Shibuya.   # The \"Hawaiian\" bread they serve is whatever so don't eat too much of it.  # They can do half portions of the salads and side dishes  # I recommend the Wagyu Skirt Steak (14 oz). It's tasty and has a nice crust. Not too hungry? Split it with 2 ppl. It's pricey at $79, but it's Wagyu.  # Average steak price is around $60. Cheaper & pricier options available.  -------------------------------------------------- MY EXPERIENCE:  --------------------------------------------------  The walk to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak is the same walk you'd take to get to Wet Republic, MGM Grand's dayclub. It was close to dinner time when I strolled to the restaurant and as I did, I went past the opposing traffic of Wet Republicans. It was a testament that the pool scene was coming to a close. For them, it was the opposing traffic of a man who lost $120 at the poker tables and ready to blow $140 more on fine dining. Of course, that wasn't obvious to them. I wasn't wearing a scarlet letter \"L\" for loser or anything.   [THE ATMOSPHERE] As a single diner, I just sat in the lounge area of Craftsteak, right by the bar. The area was fine. It overlooked the bar's illuminated collection of whiskeys, gins, vodkas, and other magical tonics. Craftsteak's ambience is familiar and comfortable -- it is clean, sleek, and modern. It's not pitch black like old school steakhouses or brightly lit. The soft yellow lighting, modern furniture, and calm noise level murmurs classy. Surprisingly, I was anti-classy, but felt comfortable in a t-shirt and shorts oddly enough.  The yelpers say \"dressy\", but I say being dressed in clothes is good enough for this occasion. I don't think they enforce a dress code, but if you have a date do wear a shirt and slacks. Look who I dined with in my plain clothes -- NOBODY.   [THE FOOD] You will be served \"Hawaiian Bread\" sprinkled with sea salt on the top, in a small Staub cast iron cakepan  It's nicely browned on the top. It looks appetizing, smells, appetizing, but why why is the taste underwhelming? The other Yelpers are right. It's too delicate in texture and taste for it to go with steak. I mean the taste is just flat and blander than actual Hawaiian bread. They need a heartier bread.   I wanted to eat some vegetables instead of eating just steak. However, the side dishes and salads seemed like too much food and a waste of money. At $13-15 for a salad or side dish uhhh probably not.  But, the server allowed me to get half orders of the Persian Cucumber salad and the Snap Peas for my side dish. Now that's more reasonable!  Now, I can get some dose of fiber and vitamins for EDC Day 2 recovery. The Persian Cucumber salad had a nice clean taste, but it was on the plain side. I just tasted fresh leafy greens and light oil with a tiny bit of zest from the ginger. I wanted more OOMMPH from the salad.  If you want a simple salad, this is your dish. Avoid this one if you expect more from your leafy greens.   My medium-rare Wagyu Skirt Steak (14 oz.) was very tasty for a lack of a better word. It had a decent caramelized crust on both sides and the dish itself was surrounded by a small pool of sauce. I love when I bite into a steak that has a full crust over it -- you get that sweet taste of caramel, marbling fat, and protein in every bite...but my Skirt Steak only had a decent crust so I didn't feel all of the magic. But I will say that the skirt steak was still an excellent choice and highly recommended under the Yelp tips section. I have no idea what kind of reduction was in the steak's pan, but it paired very well with the meat. You couldn't really taste the sauce unless you dipped your fork in and only tasted that.   My belief on pairings (whether it's wine/meat, sake/fish, sauces/food) is if your taste buds can't really notice the contrast between the 2 flavors, it means they complement each other very well. In my example, the sauce and steak almost blend into each other unnoticed. Hence, a great pairing. The glass of Pinot Noir I got wasn't a perfect pairing with the steak, but it was easy to drink with its fruit and warm spice notes  -- c'mon it's a Pinot. It can do no wrong. I got a serving of fruit out of it. Fruits, vegetables, carbs, and meat...the U.S. government should be proud of me for having a balanced, elitist meal.   I skipped dessert because it was a no no on the U.S. Food Plate diagram. Just kidding. I was just too full.   [THE SERVICE]  The server was polite and attentive. Everybody from the water guy to the steak delivery man checked up on you to see if you needed anything or if you were satisfied. I liked the service. I'll see how the service stacks up when I get an actual table with peeps",

I was surprised that I wasnt able to finish all the food!  The server recommended the tasting menu. After dining here, I would recommend that as well. The menu says 3 course meal, including appetizer, main, and dessert. I thought that meant three dishes, like 3 dishes of microscopic food. Nope. The first course included an array of appetizers, 4 of them! The server noted that I didn't care too much for seafood items. Instead of the shrimp, I picked the lobster bisque. Yup, it lives up to the rave. The other appetizers included a salad, wagyu tartare, and cheese. All were very good. My favorites were the soup and the tartare.  For the main dish, we selected the A5 wagyu New York and A5 wagyu filet mignon, med rare. 8oz each. They come already sliced on a cast iron. Tender enough to cut with your fork. Well seasoned. Very rich. Delicious. This cut of meat is not available where I live so it was a nice treat. The main also came with multiple sides. Now onto the dessert course. It wasn't just one dessert. 4 plates spread across the center of the table. Fresh fruit, house made ice cream and sorbet, monkey bread, and cheesecake. All were very good, even the fresh fruit had a little jazz. The server said they usually try to include at least one exotic fruit.  One thing I would have done different would be not to have eaten any of the table bread.  The dining area is dimly lit with dark wood accents. It has a classic business feel to it. The service staff was respectful and friendly, and water glasses were kept filled. Sommelier was also helpful and friendly. No pretentious attitude here.",

We were a group of five and we ate around 8:00pm and it was busy but not packed which was a bit concerning but also the restaurant is huge and beautifully decorated. We started with the specialty cocktails and everyone enjoyed theirs. I ordered the Blueberry Lemonade which I highly recommend if you like Gin! Our server, Mario, was attentive, not pushy, and provided lots of great suggestions. I found the menu to be a little overwhelming but our server guided us through it and I do appreciate there were lots of options.   The salads were huge and one salad could have easily been shared between 2 people. I recommend the arugula salad if you like lemon - very tasty. I ordered the filet mignon and we ordered 4 sides for the table per Mario's suggestion. We got the potato puree, cauliflower, roasted potatoes, and broccoli which were all delicious. Everyone ordered different cuts of meat but we were all equally impressed and satisfied with our choices. We had the monkey buns and Dulce de Leche cheesecake and enjoyed them both! Would definitely recommend this place and will return :) Thank you for a delicious meal and great service!",

It's not fancy or over priced it is simply delicious. Vegas has filled up on trendy cooking show restaurants including steak houses.  This one stands above the rest. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I'm not a big meat eater, but I do appreciate fine dining. Craftsteak is one of those restaurants that has a small menu, but makes sure that everything on the menu is perfected.   In terms of steak, we ordered the porterhouse, ribeye, and filet. Out of all three I enjoyed the filet the most. So tender and melted in my mouth. For the other two meats, I really couldn't tell the difference. The texture and taste was similar for both, except the porterhouse came with a special sauce.   We also ordered the potato puree, some kind of mushroom, the heirloom tomato salad, and the monkey bread for dessert. The potato puree WAS TO DIE FOR! Extra yummy mashed potatoes! The mushroom was just meh. You can probably tell my feelings towards it since I don't even remember what kind we ordered. I loved the tomato salad. Very fresh and light compliment to the heavy meat dishes.   And finally, the monkey bread is something you have to try here. It's absolutely delicious, but it does remind me of a less sugary version of a Cinnabon. The banana ice cream was a nice touch to take away some of the sweetness of the decadent dessert.    Fabulous service with multiple waiters. This is a given with the price tag you pay to eat here and with Mr. Colicchio's name hanging above the doorway.   If you are a dedicated carnivore, this place will be a delight for you taste buds, but remember that you pay for what you get as this place is pretty pricey.",

    "text": "We ordered the tasting menu which was served family style. It was an extraordinary value for $130 per person. It was difficult to resist the delicious warm dinner rolls but precious stomach room needed to be reserved for the feast ahead.  We started off with platter of San Daniele prosciutto, a warm frisee salad with a pungent gorgonzola dressing, jumbo shrimp cocktail and a delicious steak tartare. A selection of steaks, grilled and roasted, came next along with pomme puree, grits, an assortment of mushrooms and roasted asparagus. The steaks were tender and cooked rare to medium-rare. My only criticism was that they seemed under-seasoned, especially when contrasted against the expertly seasoned starters and sides. A tad disappointing since the steak should have been the star. Desserts followed and was an incredible selection of cakes, sorbet, gelatos, cheesecakes, fruit, and banana cream pudding.  As wonderful as the meal was, the service was even more exceptional. It was unbelievable perfect. Our server, Marvin, who explained he has worked for over 2 decades with Tom Colicchio in NYC, was the ultimate host. The entire team never missed a beat. Rarely does service take the starring role at a celebrity chef steakhouse but Marvin and his team were the first stars.",

The food, service and ambiance was outstanding!   I ordered the Ribeye and the recommendation of our waitress. Oh and by the way I wish I recalled her name because she was one of the best waitresses I have had.  We actually had a team of people waiting on our table but she was the lead and did amazing.  Back to the food. The Ribeye was cooked to perfection and the flavor needed no additions.  I was full half way through due to the size but I could stop eating so I finished it.  Everything is al a cart so we ordered sides of asparagus, puree potatoes, and broccolini.  All were good choices and I would order again.  To start we ordered Friseea salad with bacon and blue cheese.  Yummy is all I have to say about that.  Oh and by the way it's family style so order accordingly cuz it is a lot of food.   It's expensive but worth the price. Ill be back!",

    "text": "Coming from Chris Santos' Beauty & Essex the night before where we experienced outstanding service- we (my boyfriend and I) were expecting this to be even better and it was a little bit of a let down.   The restaurant itself is nice but not breathtaking. The service was friendly but clumsy and confusing. As we sat down we were introduced to three people who would be helping us as a team (which was very cool) except they didn't work very well as a team. We were greeted multiple times as if we had just sat down, asked the same questions again and again (have you been here before? is this your first time in vegas?) yet no one explained the menu to us- as they have a vague family style option in a box in the corner that must be explained as it has little to no actual information in it.   For drinks, we both got Old Fashions with the well whiskey which is Makers Mark. They were HUGE (yess!) but SOOOOO SWEET. Way too much simple syrup, but we didn't send them back (I actually enjoyed it).  We ordered the foie gras to start- literally all it said on the menu was foie gras, no description of the dish. When we got it, our server set it down without describing it at all. We just stared at this dish of what looked like braised peaches? maybe grilled? maybe nectarines? in some kind of sauce? with seared foie. No bread to eat it with. Very strange. There was no texture at all, the peaches were mushy, the foie was severely overcooked and nasty (and we loooooveeee foie). We had to send it back and we felt horrible. We were not offered anything else in replacement of our sent back appetizer. And in fact the manager came by and touched both the tables on either side of us but not our table at all- so so weird, did no one tell her? was there no communication about this?   30 minutes later our entree come out- steak, corn, potatoes, mushrooms. It's not until now that the manager comes over to apologize for the foie. Luckily, the steak is a perfect rare and is absolutely delicious as with the corn and potatoes. Mushrooms are only okay.   The bread, btw, that is complimentary, is GREAT. The butter could use a quick pinch of finishing salt but whatever.  2 people: 2 cocktails / 1 entree / 3 sides /  (they comped the foie) $160   TL;DR- there are probably better steakhouses in Vegas",

    "text": "One word could describe our meal at Craftsteak: Mediocre.   I'll start by saying that I've eaten at some of the best steakhouses in Las Vegas and was hoping that I could add Craftsteak to the list of my favorites. I was wrong.  Our party of 3 arrived at around 845pm and was promptly seated by the friendly waitstaff. We all opted for the tasting menu which was around $100 per person. The tasting menu included a salad,  an entree, two sides, and dessert.   It wasn't until about 920pm until our salads arrived. I opted for the Caesar Salad, which was decent but not overly impressive (as also indicated by other reviews). It was basically just a large piece of lettuce with some croutons, bottled dressing, and anchovies on top.   Our dinner didn't arrive until close to 10pm. I don't mind waiting usually but over an hour until our main course arrived is ridiculous. Here's the breakdown of what I ordered:   Hangar Steak: The hangar steak was cooked perfectly but was not seasoned. We had to request salt and pepper.   French Fries: The french fries sounded delicious on the menu description but basically tasted like McDonalds fries sprinkled with paprika. Don't be fooled by the mouth watering menu description; these fries are average.   Shiitake Mushrooms: Mushrooms were dry, tasteless, and also lacked seasoning.   We all were so disappointed with our meal at Craftsteak and expected so much more from a Tom Colicchio restaurant. We finished with our meal and informed our server that we were skipping dessert because it was now close to 11pm and we had somewhere we needed to be by 1130pm.   Next time you're in Las Vegas skip Craftsteak and stick to STK at the Cosmo or Smith and Wollensky's next to MGM Grand. You won't be disappointed in those choices.",

Omg. They were baked in this cast iron skillet. The outside was slightly crisp and brushed with butter on top with sprinkling of rock salt. The inside was warm and super soft. Perfection! Ribeye was amazingly good. Cooked to medium as requested. Did you know you can have a half order of fries? Yes. Mushroom assortment was good but we liked the shiitaki mushrooms the most. And the lobster bisque can be split in two. They serve it table side with chunks of lobster in your bowl. It was a great dining experience and would love to return one day. Definitely lives up to Tom Colicchio's name!   Oh forgot to mention that our waiter was really kind and attentive and went out of his way to answer a question that had nothing to do with the restaurant, which was where the ride sharing pick up location was. He spoke with another staff member to confirm the info he was giving us. That place runs like a well oiled machine.   My only dislike is that it was dark but that's me. I don't like to eat in the dark.",

Their Two Barrell Whiskey was excellent and they smoke it in house. I highly recommend you try. My favorite dish was their arugula pine salad. Really refreshing along with their Monkey dessert. We attempted their steak but the order had a few hiccups.  However, they comp our dessert, my French pressed coffee and my coworker's drinks were on the house which made the experience memorable.   Make sure to have a reservation as they get super swamped. If you don't, come after 9:45pm which I was told they should have a few table openings especially on weekends or convention  week.  Cheers!",

The scallops are excellent and tastes like the ocean.   The service is excellent each time I've eaten here. The ambience is modern and lighter toned than most steak restaurants.  The one thing that I would change is the lobster bisque. I would prefer to see large chunks of lobster.",

    "text": "This place is an amazing place and experience. We decided to come here for our anniversary and the service was top notch. We got the special where you can pick your course meals for appetizer and meats for smaller portions and dessert is chefs pick. The only bad part is that the appetizer is to be shared with the 2nd person since the special is for two people at the price of 130/person  We got the cucumber salad with avocado which was very delicious, along with this beet salad which was good but thats IF you like beets lol. Not my forte though and the last appetizer dish was tomato topped with vinaigrette and herbs which light and tasty.  Now for the meats. The filet mignon was superb and out of this world. It was so moist and juicy, and it was butterflied to perfection. I though it was gonna be dry if they did that but surprisingly it was not. It was super delicious. My hubby got the t-bone steak med rare and he love it.  Lastly, the dessert course is so yummy and let me start by saying Wow. They gave us 4 side desserts lol and of course smaller portions but omg so yummy and we ended up so full that we still tasted all of them and ate half because they were all so tasty.  I would recommend this place to try it for the experience and the price is worth it to pay too. The servers were so helpful and friendly and it was top notch. I would love to come back again and eat here.",

    "text": "Overhyped and totally underwhelming.  What a terrible disappointment it was.   I have no doubt that the ingredients here are top notch. I in no way doubt the chef's ability to make food into art and his overally ability to make people want to inhale a week's worth of fats, sodium, and choloesteral, and calories into one seating--BUT this was certainly an off night for the whole establishment as a whole.  So terrible--that it's highly unlikely that I would ever give this particular off shoot of the Tom Colicchio family again.  And I LOVE Tom Colicchio.  Oh--to boot--there was a rather shocking event (or 2) that only helped to deteriote my opinion of this establishment.   I made reservations for 7 people for Saturday night at 6pm. We were all jazzed up about dining here.  We were greeted and seated immediately at one of the round tables.  After going through the menu and drooling over everyone's choices--we ordered the following:  Rack of lamb, 3 T-bones, NY strip, Filet Surf and Turf, Ribeye, 2 caesar salads, Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, and fries.  We asked the waiter if he thought that would be sufficient and he chuckled and said we could feed a small nation.  Sounds good.    Food Bread--B+:  Fresh hot buns sprinkled with sea salt.  Winner.    Caesar Salad-- A:  You can't really go wrong here.  Very tasty--especially enjoyed the anchovies.  Very light and not overly dressed.    Yukon Gold Pureed Potatoes-- D:  We all saw the pictures before hand.  We saw the layer of melted butter sauce that drowned this particular side.  It spoke our language.  This dish really proved to us that just because it's swimming in butter--it doesn't mean it's going to good.  The glutton in all of us echoed the same thing--Fail.  Aside from butter--this really didn't taste like much else.  If you got lucky--you had some chives.  Bland and rather tasteless.      Asparagus--A:  Look, I love asparagus so it in all ikelihood was going to get top marks from me--but these were superb.  Young, tender asparagus in olive oil and cracked pepper.  These were so succulent, and the flower had a perfect dry \"crisp\" bit to it.  HUGE fan of this dish.   Strip--C minus : I asked for Medium Rare.  Waiter told me it will be slightly bloody and I told him I partially wanted it to Moo when it got to the table.  My steak came out well done.  Yes--well done steak.  No red, no pink--just brown.  I don't think I need to go into detail about how this tastes.  Okay--i'll give you one word--dry.   I wanted to send it back, I wanted to sent it back so badly.  But I didn't.  I was dining with a group of friends, and I didn't want to make a scene.  I wanted everyone to enjoy their meals.    I can't go into detail about how everyone else felt about their food since I only took a small bite out of each dish.  My feelings--good, not great.    For most of the meal, we all seemed to come upon a general, silent concensus--This was craftsteak?  Not only did no one rave about the food, but no one even said anything all too complimentary.    Now--at the end of the meal, we all burst.  We all expressed our disappointment in the food.  Mediocre.  Nothing stood out.  Tasty? Yes.  But for the same price--I would gladly dine at Mastro's, Mortons, or Delmonico's (which despite its lower rating here on Yelp, is a wonderful and top notch establisbment).  Whereas we originally planned on ordering all the desserts--we were all so disappointed we decided against it.    So--a girlfriend and I both didn't finish our steaks.  They offered to pack our steaks for us and said complimentary sweets would be served soon.    No more than 4 minutes after our waiter left, a man a yeard away from our table slips/faints/whatever and hits his head on the wheeled cart.  We were shocked.  My boyfriend gets up to make sure the gentleman is okay, but is stopped short when the waiters and the fallen man's friends rush to his side.  It's a frightening.  He is obviously dazed, and it becomes apparent that he is now bleeding.  A staff member rushes over to his aid with more napkins and a bucket.    We are all in shock--as was the entire restaurant.  But we were the closest--only 4 ft away.  Then the man started to vomit.  It didn't stop.  3 times--and we had front row seats.  He was finally moved to a different part of the restaurant and awaited the ambulence.  No one addressed the incident with us--even though we had a front row seat to the bleeding and the vomit.  We ask for our take away boxes--and after coming up empty handed the first time, returns to tell us it has been thrown away.  Now these were in no form dinky portions.  It was half of our entree. He apologized and said he would have the kitchen whip up new steaks. He brought out 2 boxes 15 later and we left.  It wasn't until we got back to our hotels did we see what were in the boxes--1/2 cut up strip, asparagus, and rolls was what we got for my strip and 1/2 her t-bone.    Massive fail.",

There was entirely too much good beef there, what with all the other accoutrements that came with the meal.  We did a sort of \"steak flight\" a multi course meal deal involving Angus Beef and Kobe Beef, which... damn, I'm still reveling about.   The decor and style of this place just broods a sort of richy masculinity, a veritable playboy-ness of being strong and forward without encroaching on metrosexuality. It's as if a Wall Street broker made a down town Manhattan version of what he thought a rich style Texas steak house ought to be.  All in all this is a place you go to for either an impressive meal, or to impress others with your super credit line, and flashy new suit. It works kinda ok for a romantic meal, but over all, it's a great food dining destination.",

    "text": "If you go to Craftsteak there's really only one dish to focus on:  Braised Short Ribs.  Quick story:  I used to live/work in Las Vegas for MGM Mirage.  This is the parent company that owns lots of hotels, including the MGM Grand.  When I first started, I met with the VP of Food and Beverage at MGM Grand and as we walked the hotel to discuss the restaurants, he told me \"Todd... if you want a steak, don't go to Craftsteak.  The steak is good, but it's actually better at SeaBlue.  You go to Craftsteak for the Braised Short Ribs.\"  My Yelp friends, this dish is the F'n bomb!  You will literally die right there in your chair at the MGM Grand.  The short ribs are braised for hours until they are so tender you can barely get them out of the copper pot they are delivered in.  The juice/sauce is heavenly as well.  The steaks are great too.  I think the VP undersold them.  Great ribeye, filet and many other cuts too.  If you have the budget, I highly recommend the Chef's Tasting Menu.  Just ask them to swap one of the lesser steaks for the short ribs.  Or even better, get your meat on and order the short ribs in addition to whatever comes with the tasting menu.  The appetizers, sides and dessert are phenomenal as well.  One of my favorite places to go for steak.  Service is impeccable, the wine selection is outstanding.  The only negative part is the cost.  Being inside a major Vegas casino makes this an expensive place to eat!  But I find it well worth it.",

We decided on one really nice dinner during our trip and I am SUPER happy we decided on craftsteak.  We had a 3 course meal which included the BEST scallops I've ever had in its first course.  The kobe steak tartar was absolutely amazing as well.  For main course we had kobe skirt steak, kobe ribeye and 2 pounds of maine lobster cooked in saffron butter.  With each bite I seriously had to grab Kieran's leg and squeeze it because of the excitement.    For dessert we had a chocolate mold cake, sorbet/ice cream, fresh fruit and a cherry/peach cobbler.  All were very good, I found a seriously liking for the ice cream/sorbet combinations.  The service was exquisite, I love how they took their time.  The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice, very chic and the menu just kept it simple and delicious.  I understand now why Chef Collichio is so admired and why he has the right to \"judge\" all the chefs on Top Chef.  He knows food, he knows flavor.",

    "text": "Blog for full review of food - as this was a comped return visit I higlighted the service issues here.  As previously stated, after complaining to the GM (at that time a Mr. Jason Bartucci) with hopes that future visitors would not deal with such service we were provided a profound apology and an offer to refund the cost or to come back for a compensatory meal on the house - at the time I declined these options but on further review, a year after many fine dining experiences, I reconsidered.  In a city with so many great options I would not generally be the sort to 'forgive and forget,' but returning with my two friends - both who love steak - and remembering how good the food was I made contact with the restaurant through the MGM website.  While Mr. Bartucci (and our server) had apparently since been dismissed from the restaurant, my e-mail was answered by the new General Manager, Sebastien Vallet, who invited the three of us back for the chef's tasting with wine pairings on the house.   Taking our seats we were almost instantly met by Mr. Vallet, a gregarious and friendly man in a great looking grey suit (vastly differing from the black/white clad servers,) who promised us a fantastic meal and confirmed that I did not eat beef while my friends most certainly did.    Within moments our waters were filled - bottled water without even requesting, and our server and his assistant came to our table to once again confirm likes, dislikes, and anything we may need.  In order to not belabor service issues too much I will note a couple of issues here that, despite their obviously being overly attentive to our table, were less than impressive.  First, while Sebastien stopped by multiple times, our server spent vastly more time at a table of well clad businessmen while the assistant served as our primary server throughout.  While not \"unfriendly\" our assistant's grasp of the English language was poor at best, wines were not described as presented, and this was officially the only restaurant on my trip to Vegas where I had to fill my own water.  Another service issue presented itself later, but otherwise I have to say the team clearly \"went out of their way\" to please us - yet despite that fact, the service at Mastro's, CUT, Carnevino, and myriad other fine dining establishments vastly outpaced Craftsteak - their \"average\" being better than Craftsteak's \"best.\"  Browsing around the restaurant I was amazed at how many hockey jerseys were present - clearly not the \"business casual\" Craftsteak desires.  Arriving from our assistant server without any description (approximately 1 minute later our main server showed up to tell us what the dishes were) our mains and sides were served with a red wine of which I'm unfamiliar and neither myself nor JT enjoyed - Brad thought it was decent.  Featuring mains of a 16oz Ribeye, a 12oz Skirt, and Divers Scallops with Fennel and sides of Yukon Gold Potatoes, Sweet Corn, and Wood Roasted Asparagus this is where the other service issue came up.  As previously noted, I don't eat steak - that doesn't mean my buddies do not eat scallops.  Featuring only five scallops (we received three of the exact same dish as an appetizer last visit) and my friends each deserving to try at least one I explained to our server that this wasn't acceptable and, surprisingly, met some resistance - apparently my thin frame made him think I can't eat.  Asking if any other fishes were available I was told only tuna - again the same prep I'd had last year (there was lobster, I saw it on another table, but clearly they weren't giving this away) and inquiring about birds or pork I was told only chicken (I know they had duck and pork loin, I saw the nightly menu) so I requested the chicken.  Consenting, begrudgingly, the server asked if we wanted anything else and I emphatically stated some mushrooms would be nice.  While it took about 15 minutes to prepare, the dishes were indeed brought by yet another server - someone who actually smiled (aside from Sebastien.)  Myself - I was pleased with the food again, but still less than sold on the service given the fact that they were clearly \"doing their best\" and still seemed a little less than in-step with other restaurants of their caliber.  When it was all said and done Mr. Vallet stopped by to see how everything had been and I told him it was good - because it was.  It simply wasn't \"great.\"  Leaving a nice tip for our service team (perhaps had they known we'd be leaving a good tip the primary server would've been more available) we made our way out of Craftsteak for the last time.  Impressed enough that I plan to check out Craft the next time I'm in Los Angeles or NYC, Vegas has plenty of other options in the meats market and if I were attending repeats I'd head to CUT or Carnevino first.",

    "text": "SBC VEGAS SERIES: 11 of many reviews When you eat here... plan to REALLY EAT HERE!!!  Being the first to get here, considering I was the last to leave my hotel to get here I pulled up a chair at the bar to reeducate my palate on Las Vegas concoctions. They have this great key lime pie drink thing that tasted very much like a key lime pie. Now if only I liked key lime pie.   That aside, as the party goers eventually showed up and grouped and performed acts of stupidity in the bar we were eventually led to the furthest tables out back... which for the inebriated is a feat normally attributed to Iron Man competitors. We were greeted with a bottle of great tasting vodka that I failed to taste. I did however get more than ample face time with the apps, entrees, and dessert. Given a few more hours and I would have finished my dessert. I, out of the 20 odd gathered was the only one reprimanded to 'remain in my space.' Go figure, my reputation proceeds me even here.   On the flip, other than being told to behave myself while watching others in my entourage molest the furniture the main server for our table was delightful enough when I inquired about a special package that had been ordered before hand by my one and only. And so a beautiful lil chocolate cake was delivered to the birthday girl unannounced to her drunken surprise.   I had to admit that all things considered I really liked this dimly lit place. Especially considering that the staff and fellow patrons tolerated our loud, profanity dropping, meat indulging, alcohol grubbin', at times indecent mass of yelpers bordering on destroying artwork and the surrounding ambiance in general. Oddly I find that our disturbing presence is often not enjoyed if not tolerated mostly at the cost of the staff's nerves if not the other guest's behest.   Glad no one dropped the Yelp Card here. *cough*TeamPrincess*cough* ;D",

    "text": "If you go to a steakhouse just for the meat (is there a better reason?), Craftsteak, run by James Beard awarded, Top Chef-winning Tom Collichio is hard to top. Their selections--some roasted, some grilled--of wet and dry aged Prime Angus beef (T-Bones, hangar steaks), as well as Wagyu (American Kobe) are expansive and show a True appreciation of beef. In particular, the wagyu flatiron and wagyu skirt steak are both loaded with flavor despite dense velvety texture (and the skirt steak held a beautiful char). Though their prime hangar steak was virtually as good, aged so thoroughly it had the distinct essence of blue cheese (undoubtedly the deal of the menu, if not the best meat for its price in the whole town). All meat is finished in a bordelaise reduction that makes the thought of any other sauce redundant.   There are of course oysters and several other shellfish options.  Their sides and options show an attention to fresh ingredients rather than tried-and-True recipes---market mushrooms, Jerusalem artichokes, a sweet corn dish with \"cult status\" (says the waiter), and a fine persian cucumber salad are among the must-haves.   Wine pairings were good, not great. They have a category-killing selection of well over 100 Scotch whiskeys, and plenty of big California Cult wines on their list, if money is burning a hole in your pocket.  For dessert, their exceptionally light bread pudding and seasonal fruit proved an excellent finish.  Comfortable, modern, neutral ambiance in a room that feels intimate despite its size. Service is family style.",

    "text": "Craftsteak is a high end American Steakhouse and has all the fancy (i.e. Wagu) beef options you would expect to find in such an establishment today.  It is not quite as stuffy as some of the other high end steak houses I have visited throughout this great country, but it is still upscale.    My friends both had the surf and turf and thoroughly enjoyed their meal -- steaks were cooked to temp.   Upon recommendation of the waiter (I was undecided on what I wanted) I tried the braised veal and octopus combination.   As promised the veal was fantastic, however the octopus was a tad over cooked (chewy).   Appetizers were spot on.  (Who doesn't love a cooked egg on their salad?)  The wine list is extensive and can be a bit challenging for those of  us who do not have our own personal wine cellars.   8 pages of Pinot's? My ADHD kicked in around page 5.  Not to mention the pages and pages of other varietals.   Fortunately the sommelier I flagged down was very helpful and was able to help me select a nice bottle in our price range ($100) for the evening.   In the end they were out of the bottle I selected, but upgraded us to a more expensive wine from the same vineyard (at the original bottle price).   Overall the service was disappointing and I expected better out of a high end steakhouse in Vegas. Notice I said \"flagged down\" a sommelier.  You would think that one might have appeared while I was looking through their encyclopedia-length wine list or that our server would have offered to grab one, but no.  I resorted to long stares at them and called on my powers of telepathy (just kidding about that second part - I did have to stare one down to get him to come over).    The servers were aloof and disjointed.  Plates that should have been cleared were not done promptly.  It was just a bit sloppy given the otherwise elevated caliber of the restaurant.  I really love a nice steak, but if you have access to a big city with high end steakhouses there are probably more exciting things to try while in Vegas.  You can have steak when you are at home.  That said,  it was a good meal and I would go again if friends selected it.",

As far as service goes, I don't think my water cup ever got below 2/3rds full before it was refilled - that and the knowledgeable staff are big in my book. Atmosphere is perfect for a steak house, and there's a fair amount of seating (still recommend reservations). I'd give the food 4.5 stars, simply because the steak was a little uneven, but still very good. The side dishes are where the real flavor is, I'd highly recommend the sweat corn.",

    "text": "If you decide on eating at Craftsteak, I suggest you come prepared with two things: alot of cash and a huge appetite for meat. The cash, because even though the menu is extensive (items range from about $12 to $130, with most meats being $50 and up), you owe it to yourself to try the 3 course Kobe Tasting Menu at minumum. At $130 per person, it isn't cheap, but when you're done you'll realize that it was money well spent. The appetite, because assuming you've ordered the above, you will be rewarded with the most insanely good, heavenly Kobe steaks on earth along with impressive sides and desserts.   Our party of four decided to go big (I don't believe in coming to these caliber restaurants and ordering small) and we were rewarded with Kobe filet mignon, Kobe ribeye, Kobe skirt steak, and Kobe sirloin. Being a chefs' tasting menu, we did not get to decide what starters/sides/cuts/desserts to order, but this made the experience that much more exciting. The entire meal was served family style, giving everyone an opportunity to try everything. The wine list was equally impressive, actually it was more like a book than a list. Apparently there were over 700 wines in it, with some bottles topping over $8000 (we did NOT go this big).  Each cut of meat was presented in either a cast iron or stainless steel pan, complete with the most amazing steak sauce reductions. The filet, ribeye, and skirt steak easily could have been the best three cuts of steak I've ever had. The Kobe sirloin seemed pedestrian in comparison, but was easily up there with most cuts at any other top steakhouse. The starters and sides were also very good with the highlights being the Kobe beef tartare and the potato puree. The four desserts were also excellent but probably weren't enjoyed as much because all of us were in a Kobe-beef induced haze.  The service, decor and ambiance was excellent as expected, my only complaint being that the restaurant is super dim. Everyone in our party agreed that they'd definitely come back despite the bill, but probably would order a la carte since we knew what cuts of meat and sides we wanted, and we probably wouldn't order quite as much food. Thanks, Tom Colicchio!",

Thanks Nadia for making reservations to have dinner and we got to try out there tasting menu for 85 bucks. It was alot of food for our group of 18. The food was fab and perfectly cooked and the drinks were all wonderful. I ordered the espresso martini which was de-lish. We all got a shot of the most smooth vodka I have ever had. It came in such a pretty blue bottle. I know Cindi wanted to take it home. Our waiter Blue was wonderful and accommodated our crazy group of Yelpers. Overall it was a great night and to see everyone all dress to the T. Would love to come back and try other dishes and check out Tom's other restaurants too.",

    "text": "If you're going to have Kobe Beef you might as well go for broke and do the tasting menu here. It was an awesome value for the amount of food included. My husband and I shared 4 apps.: 2 salad like things, the Hawaiian prawns (sweet and buttery) and a charcuterie platter. For the sides, we were given mashed potatoes (kinda runny and pasty), sauteed mushrooms and grilled asparagus. And for the meat, oh baby the meat...Kobe fillet and sirloin, cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was truly one of the most succulent meals we've had in a long time. Yeah, sure the sides and salads could be considered forgettable and how can a meat and potatoes place actually mess up mashed potatoes? But really, compared to how the food scene was in Vegas 10 years ago, this place could be considered fantastic.   But I did say, \"could.\" So here's my beef (ha-ha, get it?), the dessert. I'll remember this because it just seemed so off. We got monkey bread with caramel sauce (the bread was not golden enough, in fact it looked kinda anemic in the darkly lit dining room), molten chocolate cake (ho-hum, I might as well have gotten a vanilla creme brulee), sorbet and gelato quartet ( no fireworks here) and a sliced Asian pear (that's right, sliced, not even nicely sliced, with the seeds still in it. And no, it wasn't even poached). Something definitely fell short in the kitchen.  My other beef is the service, my biggest pet peeve. So this is how it usually goes, servers welcome you in, give you a menu, talk you up and completely sell you on the experience that you are about to have. They get you your order, get your drinks, even go next door to another restaurant to get you a bottle of sake because they don't carry any and once they drop the entrees, the main event, it's like a black hole suddenly appears in the middle of the dining room. Where did the server go? Is that him, oops my bad, that was just an illusion. It kinda looks like him but he keeps disappearing and acting so uninterested in you that it can't be him. My advice to servers is this, follow through with your diners man. You could have made up for the bad dessert experience if you even bothered to check if we wanted coffee!   So, sad to say, it was a good and bad experience, I would have loved to give this place 4 stars because the beef was just so amazing. This place definitely suffered from bad service. Despite the fact that our guy was nice enough to go next door for us to get us some sake.",

We both ordered three courses each, all different so we could taste as much as possible. We ended up with way more than we could eat. Leftovers! We got the beet salad, lobster bisque, braised short ribs, wyagu beef, seasonal mushrooms,  and the fresh corn.   All in all it was a good experience. The service was excellent and the decor was nice. I will say that all the food was very, very salty. If it was less salty, I probably could've eaten a lot more. Other than the salt issue, the food was good. I would recommend the beet salad and the braised short ribs. Those two were delicious.   Pretty pricey, but worth it if you want to go out for a nice dinner. It's also a family-style restaurant. BTW, it says that it's a dressy place, but you don't really need to dress up. I saw plenty of tourists walk in with cargo shorts and Hawaiian shirts on. So don't sweat that.   They also have a very extensive liquor and wine list.",

I always go for the Surf & Turf Wagyu Tasting and I'm never disappointed. Alright, I'll say that the Ceasar Salad isn't a highlight but again, you're going to a restaurant with the word 'Steak' in the name so that definitely sets expectations.  The lobster is divine totally bathed in butter - I can feel myself getting fatter is write this... and I love it. The skirt is my favorite - so rich and buttery, it literally melts in your mouth. Everything is served family style so your best bet is to come with a group so you can sample everything. The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous. And to end everything, dessert ranges from assorted sorbets to mixed berry cobbler to my personal favorite... monkeybread!  The service is literally impeccable. They're kind, courteous and engaging not to mention they're at your table all the time to see if you need anything. This last time, I came for my anniversary and not only did the waiter comp us a bottle of Muscato but also ANOTHER dessert that had, \"Happy Anniversary\" with our names written in chocolate. He was also kind enough to make reservations at L'atelier Joel Robuchon for us for the next night.  We dropped easily $400 for the 2 of us that night but if there were any restaurant worth doing it at, CraftSteak would be it (well, aside from French Laundry, of course :)",

    "text": "First, let me say it makes me sad to write this review. I have been telling everyone for years that this is my favorite restaurant in the world. Which is quite a statement.  Always eat here when in Vegas. This last trip was kinda special for me, as I brought someone who had never been to Vegas before and really wanted to show them the Vegas that a lot of people don't get to see. Having already told them that this was  all time favorite restaurant, I made reservations before I left home. Reservations were for a Tuesday at 7pm.  We arrived early and were seated immediately.  We were sat in the bar area, next to another couple. I was upset, because I was trying to make a good impression and here we are in the noisy bar. I so wanted to get up and complain, but didn't want to look stupid in front of my guest. I ordered the short ribs, which are always amazing. This time they were beyond terrible. The entire bottom layer was pure fat, which gave the rest of meat a grease flavor.  The broth like gravy they come in tasted like vinegar. I could have cried. I just bit my tongue and tried to have a good time, but I was so embarrassed. My guest had the surf and turf and loved the filet, but said the lobster was rubbery.  Couldn't wait to just leave. I spend a lot of money dining out, and a $264.00 meal for two before tip doesn't bother me at all. But my food was so bad, and the table was so bad, I would have been happier in the food court.  I am going back to Vegas in 3 months and I will go back one more time. It is hard to give up on a place that has been your favorite for so long. But I think I am done with the short ribs, they were so gross I have lost my taste for them.",

With the group size we had, we didn't have full access to the full menu, but a well thought out tasting menu.  Two things that stood out was the Kobe steak and the different assortment of desserts.  I've never had Kobe up to that point, but it truly is an experience.  The way it was prepared, and I'm sure you've always heard how it melts in your mouth, well...it really does melt in your mouth.  Now the dessert, what I remember from this experience is, the pepper flavored ice cream.  You say pepper?  Yes, pepper.  I can exactly say its for everyone, but if you have an open mind and enjoy trying out new things, it's worth a bite.",

    "text": "My foodie friend recommended this place to me when she found out I was going. She said it was like the best meal she ever had, and I completely agree with her.   We made late reservations after a show, we got there earlier than expected but the staff was more than accommodating. They seated us way before our reservation time. The ambiance of the restaurant was so inviting, it would have been great for a large group of people celebrating and a more intimate date type situation.   We chose to do the chef's menu. There were just way too many selection and this way was easier. For the chef's menu you choose from I think three types of meat, the angus beef, the domestic wagyu, and a surf and turf. The prices are set accordingly, 115, 140, and 160 respectively. Since everything is shared, you can't choose an option different from your table. (Maybe a bigger group can, but it was just me and my BF and we had to choose the same type of meat) We let the chef choose what cuts to give us and how to prepare, you can't go wrong there. They also gave us the option of choosing what sides we wanted, or just have the chef choose what he thought would go best with the main dishes. We let the chef choose and loved everything. The roasted red bell peppers with garlic was my favorite. The wagyu beef tartare was freakin amazing!! There was also a plate of various types of mushrooms, you'd love it if you're a mushroom fan. The potato puree was delicious, buttery and creamy. There was also grilled prawns, an arugala salad, and roasted corn....all were delish. Even the complimentary dinner rolls were awesome!!! They came in the baking dish they were made in and were sprinkled with sea salt.   There was soooo much food, even big eaters like me and the BF had trouble finishing everything. The meal was worth every penny...so I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who's celebrating in Vegas or just wants a great meal experience. The service was top notch, they made sure we were comfortable, understood the menu options, and made recommendations to us for drinks they thought we'd like.",

    "text": "I had such a big meat craving before going to Vegas. I thought I could satisfy it at the buffets but it just wouldn't do. So finally my boyfriend and I had a night to ourselves (we went with a group of friends), and we were staying at MGM. It was a weeknight and so restaurants close at 10-10:30. It was getting close to 10 so we decided to eat somewhere inside the hotel and ended up at Craftsteak. I had no expectations going in since I've never heard of it...I only hoped for the best.   The ambiance is kind of dark and simple yet with a touch of elegance. The waiters were somewhat attentive but not very helpful as in what they recommended and why. We weren't planning to spend a lot on dinner so I opted for the 10oz Roasted Sirloin rather than Filet Mignon, which is what I would usually get. I was sooo anxious waiting for my food to come...which did take awhile. But when it finally came, I was in food heaven. Or close to it. The sirloin was fairly tender, juicy, and pre-sliced. The roasted part of the sirloin was tasty and not burnt. Mmmm it was delicious! I tasted a bit of my boyfriend's Ribeye which was more tender and enjoyable. I think I would prefer the sirloin over the ribeye there. We also had a side of the Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms. They were okay...nothing too special. And we didn't even bother to look at the dessert menu! =( We were way too full to even look.  I have only one thing to complain: I ordered my cut medium because the waiter said the medium-well might be a little dry with very little pink. But the medium that came seemed more like a medium-rare. So I had my boyfriend eat the bloodier parts. Oh well.   Total came out to be about $140 including drinks. I think it was pretty decently priced. But it would have been better if the entrees were not a la carte.   To end on a good note, the Lemondrop Martini was pretty good! (I normally do not like martinis) And it actually had a lemondrop candy in it!",

I decided to try the domestic wagyu (grade 8) ny cut.  I couldn't have been more satisfied.  The steak was cooked perfectly to my liking.  The steak was unadulterated to let the natural flavors come through.  Having a perfect crust and gradual pink to red inside, the steak seriously tasted better as I ate it.  The taste of the marbling definitely came through.  I could only image what the A5 Wagyu tastes like now.    We also decided to share the yukon gold mash, chantrelle mushrooms, and sauteed spinach.  All 3 choices accompanied my steak very well.    The service was what you expect from a restaurant of this level.  Our waiter was courteous and checked on us just enough not to be annoying.  The rest of the waitstaff was very pleasant as well.  The decor was nice and contemporary.  I wish it was a little brighter inside though so that I could see my delicious steak better.",

We were promptly greeted upon our arrival and were seated along the back booths.  The decor and the lighting was 'fitting' for the place and as well as the menu.   After several minutes pondering the menu, we had the shrimp cocktail to start which was nothing special and I should have expected that this being a steak place.    We shared the 32 oz Porterhouse for two with assortment of mushrooms, fingerling potatoes and roasted corn.  And yes the porterhouse was delicious - juicy, perfectly seasoned and the fillet was outrageous.  The side dishes were somewhat ordinary BUT the surprise of the dinner was the roasted corn.  We just had to ask the waiter for the recipe which he was more than happy to share.  Just delicious. The service was impeccable as well as the ambiance.  Was it the best steak I have ever had?  Perhaps if it wasn't for the roasted corn, it might have been......  Cheers,",

When he realized he was taking too long without ever greeting us, he held a finger up to me as if to say \"one minute\" as he walked by. Have you lost the power of speech? Speaking of which, his \"helper\" Blas then came over, barely explaining anything about the menu. His presentation was further hampered by the fact that his words were completely incomprehensible. But, onto the food. The arugula salad had a dressing on it that was saltier than anything I've ever tasted. The ribeye was cooked nicely, but was barely above room temperature. Their fries, which were supposed to be seasoned with paprika and vinegar lacked any of the latter. The high point of the meal was the sorbet. Completely disappointing for someone who has been to Old Homestead, Delmonico's, Delfrisco's, Gallagher's, The Palm, and so on...",

After hearing stellar reviews and dozens of praises we gave it another go and had their seasonal tasting menu.  Overall, our second Craftsteak experience was better than the first. We've had years in between visits, I noticed the regular menu had been completely redone. Still we failed to see what warrants the praises the restaurant receives. There are too many other steakhouses that offer better tasting quality meats and more creative menus. We don't believe Craftsteak deserves a third chance. We have no intentions to return.",

The Blue Cheese salad was goodess with creamy dressing and chunks of bacon. Excellent and extensive wine list.  The porterhouse for two  was cooked perfectly. And as a side to the steak we had the potato puree. I could drink that stuff straight. Quite possibly one of the best meals ever. The service was impeccable (we had 2 servers!) and the bartender was super friendly and made great menu recommendations while we waited over a cocktail for our table.

Upon our return, we were seated at a tiny table for two, in the packed bar! When asked, \"Is there something more private for us? This is rather uncomfortable,\" the host responded with, \"Well, since you made your reservation today, this is what we have for you.\" Ok, that's fine, we'll relax and make the best of it. A server quickly came by, asking for our order yet, we hadn't  opened the wine list nor reviewed the menu yet. After deciding what we'd like to order, about 10mins later, we waited patiently for our server who never showed after another 15mins so we left. We walked over to L'Atelier thinking we had no chance of getting a seat yet alas, we were seated and had another FABULOUS evening! Thank You and we'll be back to support the Joel Robuchon again in a heartbeat. Sorry Tom Colicchio. Cheers!",

Our waiter had graced us with 2 complimentary wines during the course of the evening once he figured we were in Vegas celebrating a bachelor party and meeting the bachelor himself. Officially our pre-drink began at Craftsteak :) We didn't even have to wait until we got back to the room! Later that evening, XS nightclub @ the Encore was our next destination (refer to my review on XS nightclub).  A few of us ordered the Japanese \"A5\" Wagyu beef (ie. 12oz, strip steak, etc) and from the first bite, we were sold. This was the best tasting steak we had ever tasted....period!  I personally went with the strip steak and each bite caused the little hairs on the back of my neck to stand up and bring shivers down my spine.   As for our sides, we went with Romaine hearts caesar salad and shiitake mushrooms (yum!).    The atmosphere is similar to other Las Vegas steakhouses so business casual wear is sufficient.  T-shirts and flipflops, please don't!  The next time I'm in Las Vegas, I plan to visit other steakhouses but for those of you looking for your first steakhouse in Las Vegas, you can't go wrong with Craftsteak @ MGM Grand.",

When it turned out to be nearly tasteless, I took in a couple of sips of wine. I truly didn't want to believe that the lovely Tom Colicchio could own such a mediocre restaurant. Even after a few glasses, the food was just okay. Hands down, the worst part of my Vegas trip.",

I am no food critic but I know what tastes good.  The service was amazing but the meal went downhill quickly. This mixed drink was weak. Of the 3 appetizers only one was decent. The ham thing was terrible, pretty hard to screw up shrimp cocktail, and the house speciality salad was decent.  The main course consisted of filet, ny strip, and a ribeye. All three were ordered medium rare which came out rare which is ok because it is better than over done. Upon tasting the first bite I was pissed. There was no seasoning, natural flavor, or marinade. The only good thing was the texture which had a nice velvety texture which melted in your mouth yet was tough to chew. I then noticed this horrible taste which I can only compare to an old grass fed cow which is fine for hamburger or an apple bees. This was no grain fed quality yearling.  To finish the meal the desserts were disgusting.",

    "text": "Ugh....Just a terrible overall dining experience.  I took a party of five here tonight July 11, 2015.  We started with a Ceaser Salad split 5 ways around the table (they are served family style).  Clearly it had been made hours ago and was ice cold (right out of the refrigerator), dry and tasteless.  If we had gotten these at the Elks Club annual dinner I'd have been ok with it but at $16 a pop it was embarrassingly bad.  Each of us ordered steaks at different temperatures.  The plates were summarily dropped in front of us with no one asking us to see if they were done to our liking.  As it turned out one of them was badly overcooked (ordered blue and came out medium) and two were significantly underdone.  The food was served by runners/expediters but we did not see a waiter for another 20 minutes.  Finally I flagged down a bus boy and asked him to get a person in charge.  They use a team system at this restaurant and the woman who took our drink order came over.  We told her the problem with the overcooked steak and she seemed baffled by our complaint.  About 10 minutes later a manager came to the table.  She said all the right words but I didn't get a warm and fuzzy feeling about her willingness to help.  When we got the check there in black and white was a $98 charge for a steak that had only one bite out of it.  On the plus side my friend does have a dog and I'm sure he was happy.  We had dessert and it again was just dumped at our table.  Five spoons were given but no plates.  We ate dessert out of our coffee saucers.  On high note the French Press coffee is excellent!  So if you are looking for an alternative to Starbucks I highly recommend it.  But if you are looking for a good meal with top notch service......save yourself a $1000 and go any place else.",

I usually like to try restaurants from famous chefs just to check out the HOOP-LA!! So me and 3 of my friends were in vegas and we went to Craft Steak.  We had their tasting menu paired w/ wine.   Everything was great.....We had ribeyes with all the fixings...mashed potatoes...greens...mushrooms.....everything was soooo good. Now..my review is a little biased and the reason why I gave it 5 stars is because one of my friends who was dining w/ me is friends w/ the pastry chef of the restaurant...and she sent out EVERY dessert on the menu to our table for free...  -chocolate cake strawberry shortcake cinnamon monkey bread vanilla bean cheesecake chocolate souffle banana pudding fresh fruit 6 flavors of ice cream 6 flavors of sorbet.. Panna Cotta Rice Pudding  the desserts just kept coming..... and I don't care what anyone says.... If you're a SKINNY MINNIE or a FATTY McPATTY...everyone loves dessert! The couple next to us were amazed at the desserts that kept coming out of the kitchen and right to our table.  We all looked like kids in a candy store..and of course, I had to try each one.   By the time we were done with everything....we practically had to be rolled out of the restaurant....  The service was excellent and attentive...i would definitely try this place again....but theres so many more chefs out there that I need to catch up with first!",

We were a party of 7 and we went for the domestic wagyu surf and turf chef selection for 6.  We really could have gone for 5.  Our server, Kevin (I think that was his name), was absolutely the BEST!  He made the experience absolutely memorable!  After we had picked our sides, he mentioned to us that we had missed the top 2 selections and helped us by making 2 of our sides as half sides to add in the top 2.  I love it when I get suggestions from the staff because they always know best.  He was personable, very friendly, and he was a delight to be around.  You could tell that he really enjoyed being there and was sooooo welcoming.  Possibly  one of the best servers that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  The steak was absolutely delicious and all of the sides were delicious, especially the grilled corn.  A lot of steak places have okay sides, but Craftsteak was well balanced with everything tasting fabulous.  The assorted desserts were delicious as well.  I really enjoyed this dinner and I loved the sharing aspect!",

    "text": "Not a great experience. Had to wait 20 minutes even with a reservation. Server disappeared after entrees were served and never came back. Had to ask busboy for our check after waiting 30 mins after we were done.  Ordered the \"Black Label\" Wagyu ribeye and New York steaks, both medium rare. Toughest ribeye ever. Grain appeared stringy like a skirt steak with absolutely no marbling. The New York steak, even tough being a leaner cut, was perfectly marbled, like a slab of pork belly.  My recommendation for steaks would be Pucks' CUT at the Palazzo; or Joel Robuchon for the double portioned Kobe.",

    "text": "I was here a few years ago and didn't even know it was tom colicchio's place.  At that time I left there thinking it was one of the best meals I have ever had.  I was with a large party for a bday and to speed up dinner we all decided to do one of the dinner samplers that was offered.  It was about 110 per person I think for that option.    Everything that was served was perfect.  There must have been 2 apps, 3 to 5 side dishes and 3 different meat main courses.  Everything served was hot, juicy,  tender and flavorful.  I'm only giving 4 stars because i went a while ago and Joe's has turned into my steak house of choice in vegas.  I do plan to go back and revise this review.  If the quality has stayed the same you will see why tom colicchio is on TV.  He knows what he is doing.",

This place is pricey, but I would gladly pay their prices for the amazing food. Those buns they bring out are pure heaven, the steak was cooked to perfection and had beautiful flavour, the portions of the sides are a great size for sharing.  Overall best $100 I spent on a meal just for myself as you can get.",

    "text": "My three stars is price dependant, just a heads up but even if the bill was halved it wouldnt break 4 stars.  I wanted to check Colicchio's place out being a huge fan of Top Chef.  I wont lie I had my expectations set high.  The place was packed when a buddy and I got there.  No worries, its great people watching and the bar had everyhing I could possibly want.  When we were seated, what I noticed is I was glad I was here with a buddy and not a gal, it felt like a cafeteria.  I think it was the size of the place and how open it was, just an observation. The service was very good, attentive but not fussy.  The bread really is as good as everyone says, the little sea salt on top made it.    Now the main course, we had the mushrooms, asparagus and gratin potatoes.  The potatos were good but when arent potatos gratin good, I was expecting great.  The others were blah, it took me awhile to remember what we had thats how ehh they were.  Now my biggest dissapointment.  I got the domestic wagyu ribeye medium rare, my buddy got the ribeye medium rare.   Side by side comparison.  Mine was a little overcooked and I was unwilling to wait for them to get it right.  We were in agreement, his was better and half the cost.   Dessert the apple pie/turnover/ whatever al a mode was awesome the high light of my meal.    So a decent meal but nothing outstanding and certainly not for the four bills with tip, two of us dropped to eat there.",

    "text": "Really incredible meal at Craftsteak. I wanted to love Craftsteak because I love Top Chef and I was not challenged in this.   My husband and I ordered the Waygu Beef Chef's Menu and received incredible homemade parkerhouse rolls with quality butter, excellent first course dishes (and lots of them!). We then got waygu beef cooked two different ways and amazing sides of Brentwood corn, smashed potatoes and one other that I unfortunately cannot remember. The beef was fabulous.  Then dessert, oh dessert. The waiter brings out this tray of 6 different large desserts (for us and our 2 friends who ate there as well). We thought that this was one of those things where we pick what we like of those. Nope, he puts all the dishes down on the table. Sorbet trio, molton chocolate cake with cinnamon cream, fruit crumble, a few others including the best: monkey bread pudding with caramel sauce! Oh, that was a meal to remember!",

    "text": "Craftsteak, though still good, is not the same restaurant that got me to write a 5-star review in June.  My main gripe is that for the same price, you are now getting much less food. I was there this past weekend and again a group of eight of us had the Wagyu tasting menu. Gone is the Kobe tartare, replaced with a salad of just lettuce. Gone also is at least 2 cuts of steak while the remaining cuts seem smaller than before. The shitake mushrooms were very dry this time. Our table was also not covered with endless deserts like last time. Rest assured that you will not go hungry but it's no longer the extravagance it once was. And for the same ~$200 per person bill, you definitely have better choices now.  If I go back, if, I would opt for something a la carte next time.",

    "text": "WHO: Me and my boyfriend WHY: Our 4th year anniversary  This visit makes it our 3rd visit at Craftsteak and all I can say is I've been consistently pleased with the food items I've ordered and the service I've had.   Me and the bf were seated in a comfy booth, which I requested when I previously made our reservation online on MGM's website.  Our server introduced himself and also wished us a happy anniversary.  **On a sidenote, I mentioned this detail in my online reservation and so I'm pretty sure he was aware of that detail since we didn't specifically tell him of our occasion.**  We placed our drink orders: my bf ordered a Martini and I ordered a Champagne Martini.  A lady carrying a large professional camera then came up to us and asked if we wanted our picture taken.  We said sure and for the next minute or so, I felt like we were at a photo studio with the poses she suggested we do and the bright flash going off every other second.  She told us she'd bring the photos back later for us to look at and with that she left.  Our drinks came out along with the cute mini bread loaf and butter. By this time we already knew what to order:   -No appetizer since 2 side dishes and our entrees would be more than enough for the both of us -2 Side Dishes: the Roasted Garlic and Leek Gratin & the Roasted Corn  -Entrees: the 8oz Wagyu Beef (medium) for me & the 10oz Wagyu Beef (medium well) for the bf  By the time our order was brought out, we had also ordered a 2nd round of drinks.  The past 2 times we've eaten here, we've always ordered the Leek Gratin because of its creamy garlicky deliciousness.  We had never eaten leeks until Craftsteak, but the boatload of butter, cream and roasted garlic added to the dish and you might not realize you are eating leeks cuz its that damn good.   The past 2 times we've been to Craftsteak we've ordered the spinach which is good, but not great and so we settled on the Roasted Corn...it easily became our 2nd side dish for future visits. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, tasted lovely, as usual, and easily devoured. I was also completely surprised at how my champagne martini paired well with my meal.  The champagne's bubbliness cut through the heaviness of the rich gratin and meaty steak. At the end of our dinner, our server asked if we wanted any dessert.  When we said no, he kept jokingly asking us if we were really sure.  We told him we were happily stuffed and couldn't fit anything else in our bellies.  He left and a few minutes later he presented us with a small plate of bite-sized sweets and the words \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate.  OMG, super cute and super sweet!  No sooner had he left, when the lady who took our photos presented us with different photos and an option to purchase a (cheesy) pleather album containing our choice of any 2 photos.  Since the photos did come out cute, I picked the 2 photos while the bf handled the cost.  The grand total for this pleather album with 2 photos?????  $85. Yes, $85 for 2 pictures in a cheesy black pleather album.  However, given that we were in Vegas, on our anniversary, and presented with great looking photos of the both of us together we couldn't say no.  As a 'freebie' the lady threw in 2 wallet sized pictures also in a cheesy pleather wallet carrier.    Long review short: I love the service. I love the drinks. I love the food. And apparently...I love their $85 photos!",

    "text": "I came to Las Vegas for a business trip, and the company offered to have let us have a meal on them. I've always wanted to give Tom Collichio's restaurant a try, so me and my co-workers felt it would be a perfect opportunity to give it a try. Our server for the evening was a extremely hospitable and friendly server by the name of Marvin. He checked in on us through out the night, offered some interesting conversation pieces, made sure that our drinks, breads and sides were always topped off, but also gave us space and let us enjoy our food and conversation.  One note, there are photographers circulating in the restaurant with digital SLR's offering to take your picture but keep in mind, it's gonna cost you 25 bucks if you want to take one home... kinda of a rip if you ask me.  On to the meal, we all did the kobe style wagyu beef - grade 8 tasting meal which was going to run about 130 a person.  The bread came out in a cast iron square pan, with a light sprinkling of kosher salt, with a auburn glowing sheen.  Each bite was warm, fluffy and had a mild sweetness to it, I probably went after 4 pieces before my dinning companions reminded me that there was an actual meal coming.  Starters Caesar salad with anchovy: Tasted like a traditional Caesar salad, I've had plenty of takes on this Caesar, it was good, nothing revolutionary but good nonetheless.  I did put a nice sized anchovy fillet into a piece of bread I was eating.  :D  Baby artichokes: This was amazing.  One of my favorite starters of the night, the artichokes were nice and tender, not vinegary at all, and there was a nice light and refreshing dressing that went with it.  I could have munched on those all night.  Watercress salad: The watercress was light and refreshing, some cucumbers and thinly sliced red onions, the dressing was lightly tossed in with it. Let's face it, I came to eat at a steak restaurant, I'm not here for the salad.  Grilled Prawns - One of the other starters that came, that again I loved.  The Prawns were nice and meaty, and buttery. They were succulent, the flesh had a nice sweetness to it. The shells had a nice aroma and a crispiness to it like a cracker. They served it with a dipping sauce, but it was so good, I didn't even use it.  Prosciutto - Thin little slices of pork preserved in salt with a heavy marbling of fat.  We all know how good this is, no need to say more.  Sides Sauteed White Corn - Sauteed, caramelized, buttery corn with a natural sweetness. It wasn't creme of corn but I think with all the butter in it, it came pretty close!  (No complaints here!) It was awesome!  Yukon gold puree with roasted garlic: Really nice creamy puree of Yukon potatoes. Pretty simple. But really damn good.  Assortment of mushrooms: I love mushrooms, and this mix included several mushrooms like, hen of the woods, white shimeji, baby shitake &amp; golden chanterelles. Oh my dear lord, if I was a pharaoh I would want to be embalmed with this and be buried forever.    Dinner New York: Normally not my favorite cut of meat, but this one was super moist and they had a amazing herbal rub on it, probably one of the best new york cuts I've ever had.  Skirt Steak: The only times I've usually had a skirt steak was in fajitas, I was worried this too would be dry and a bit on the tough side, but this skirt steak was absolutely amazing, the sauce was extremely flavorful,  I'm glad the chef, picked this cut out for us, I wouldn't have ordered it if I had a choice in it.  Ribeye: My favorite cut, with a nice marbling of fat and once again the chef cooked it perfectly, he kept the treatment on this one pretty simple  salt, pepper and grilling it to a nice medium rare, that's all I need.  Dessert: Chocolate semifredo, with warm molten chocolate cakes and brandied cherries: Pretty much everything I love in a dessert was here, the semifredo, was almost like a flan, only extremely chocolatey, I had to have a cup of black coffee with this.  Rhubarb Crisp with vanilla gelatto: The rhubarb had a extremely nice sweetness and tartness to it, the warm topping crumble offered a nice difference in texture and of course the most important rule of all, anything a la mode makes it better, this was no exception.    Sorbet 4 flavors: They gave us 4 house-made sorbets, I liked the pineapple, grapefruit, strawberry and then the grape in that order.  Nice little pallet cleanser throughout the desert course.  Peach Pavlova, creme, fruit, peach ice cream layered on a pistachio macaroon: This had to be one of my favorite desserts for the evening, the macroon, had a nice crumbly texture with the spoon, but the moment it touches the tongue, it melts, giving off the aroma of pistachios. The fresh fruit and the ice cream made of a nice unexpected paring.  I only wish we choose our starters I didn't think we needed two salads, and I wanted to try the risotto, but still needless to say, we left stuffed and extremely satisfied.  Ever wake up with a steak induced hangover?  We did...",

The frisee had big chunks of bacon and the broken yolk  made the bacon taste 10x better.  We order a half bottle of red wine that was well worth the price too.  My like for Craftsteak ends here.   I got the flat iron steak and tried the surf and turf (ribeye and lobster tail), I can honestly say I've had better.  I'm from Texas and we've got plenty of good beef here.   I was disappointed in the rolls since I heard so much rave about them, they were good but nothing special.  Have you ever had a yeast roll from Hartz Chicken?  If yes, then you've had a roll from Craftsteak.  I wish I could say more about this place.",

    "text": "Absolutely one of the best meals I've ever had.  If you like steak, this is the place to come -- its a carnivore's heaven.  The steak here blew away the choices at Mesa down the strip.  We chose the Angus Smorgasboard for 3.  Basically, they gave us the chef's selection of appetizers, steak , and dessert.  What came out was glorious.  Appetizers included Jerusalem Artichockes and a frisee salad that was at least 3-1 bule cheese to salad ratio.  Yum.  One of my favorite parts of the meal were the side dishes that came with the main course.  The corn dish was like crack.  I could not stop eating it.  The mushroom risotto was delightful and the sweet potatoes were absolutely yummy.  The steak is the star of the show, and we got Ribeye, New York Strip, and Skirt steak.  My wife, who had to be persuaded to get steak, said afterwards that the skirt steak was one of her favorite things she's ever eaten.  My favorite was the ribeye.  FANTASTIC.  All of the steaks here are dry-aged and of the best quality you can get (and they have a full selection of Wagyu up to $300 pp).  For this quality of steak you do not (should not) need any sauces or condiments.  The meat itself is the star of the show and needs no enhancement.  Dessert was unreal as well.  A selection of sorbets and cobblers and stuff that I told myself I didn't have room for but somehow found room for.  Don't miss this place.  I didn't eat again until dinner the next night I was so full.  But that whole next day I couldn't stop thinking about that steak.....",

The fresh herbs, flawless preparation, and attention to detail is what set this dinner apart from the rest.    Every bite was a flavor explosion.  It made me feel like I was a judge on Top Chef!",

I recommend his whole menu.. Filet mignon was outta this world, also the buffalo mozz was sooooooo good and refreshing(very popular appetizer )   his salad and side veggies were great as well. When the waiter placed bread and butter on the table I was so surprised. I can't explain how delicious and soft the bread was. OmG! I could go on. This places is legit one of the best restaurant I've been too and it's far from a disappointment..:)",

    "text": "I'm disappointed that I need to give this place a 4, because they frankly don't deserve it. They don't deserve a 3, however.  I went here with my girlfriend as the main culinary experience of our trip that has been 3 years in the making. The walk from Treasure Island took 30 minutes. With reservations made a week in advance, seating was not an issue. They did make us wait 20 minutes since we got there at 8:10 instead of 8:30, however.  I was wearing a polo shirt and jeans and my girlfriend wore a casual spring dress and we never felt underdressed. I suppose the very dim dining room helped with that.  We went with the $60 summer tasting menu. The items on it can be found on Andrew W.'s review on this page.  The meal started out with PERFECT bread. It was nearly a brioche with sea salt on the crunchy top, with a perfectly soft and buttery inside.  The three starters (brought out all at once) were good too. I enjoyed the tender, juicy quail the most. My girlfriend said that hers was neither, unfortunately. She preferred the cold roasted bell peppers, which I liked as well. We were both glad to find out that watercress salads aren't as bitter as they sound.  The three main courses, however, were a disappointment. The divers scallops were good--at least for me. My girlfriend didn't like biting down on sand three times.  The fried chicken was terrible for me (I ate a piece of breast meat which was terribly dry and flavorless) but the legs were tender and juicy.  The Kobe beef ribeye was the worst dish of the meal, however. I've had Wagyu before, which might have been part of the disappointment. We were also partially to blame by getting the meat too well done, I think. We realized immediately after we had ordered that Medium Well would be too much, but we hoped it would be okay. Unfortunately, it wasn't all our fault. The meat itself had hardly any marbling. At the high heat we chose, the fat should have melted even more and the meat shouldn't have been so tough and dry. I'm sad to say that the Kobe beef at the Bellagio buffet was more delicious.  The sides (again, 3 of them), were decent. Sweet corn (nothing special there), garlic potato gratin (a substitute for the mashed potatoes), and the sauteed shitake mushrooms (dry, rubbery, poorly seasoned).  By the time we were halfway done with the main courses, we were exhausted. It's a problem, in my mind, that patrons don't feel guilty when they leave half of their main courses sitting on the table. It wasn't delicious enough to force yourself to eat some more.  When dessert rolled out (again, all at once), we were floored. Monkey bread (too sweet), chocolate lava cake (okay), sorbets & ice creams (thank God for something light), and blueberries & raspberries finished the meal.  While th meal started out well, it didn't continue the upward trend. It's a sad day when a steakhouse's meat loses out to its bread & its roasted peppers.  An enjoyable evening, but I don't miss it.  ====  Rubric: 5 = Mindblowing 4 = Excellent 3 = I see the charm 2 = Disappointing 1 = Never again",

    "text": "We came here for my 25th birthday dinner when the SBC was in Vegas and it had to be the highlight for me of the trip.   Prior to arriving in Vegas I had made plans with Craftsteak to accomodate our large party. Because there were about 19 of us, we had to make sure that they could even accommodate us since it was a Sat night at prime dinner time and they did, all that was involved was a 6 page contract and a $500 deposit. Just dealing with that part was a pain, hence the -1 star but it is understandable.   But when we got there, after a little delay in getting us seated since the people who were sitting at one of the tables we were getting took forever to sign their check and get up, we were seated and the fun began. Shortly after sitting, the hostess apologized for the wait and gave everyone at the table a complimentary shot of a yummy Polish vodka, an awesome way to start the meal.   Then all the delicious food started coming out. I had the wine pairing with my meal as well and all of it went perfectly! - First the bread was absolutely amazing. With some butter that just melted into the warm bread served in a skillet, I was in heaven from the start. - Appetizer Course: Shaved Fennel Salad, Shrimp (I believe this was in place of the quail), Buffalo Mozzarella with Red Pepper Caponata Persian Cucumber Salad (all delicious but of course me being the huge seafood lover I am, I adored the shrimp with the juicy shrimp head. Wine Pairing: A very clean and smooth riesling - Main Entree: Prime Beef Flat Iron, Angus Skirt Steak, Diver Sea Scallops- All steak was cooked perfectly, not too well done at all and the scallops were fresh, juicy and divine! Wine Pairing: A red, can't remember what at that point since I shared it with my bro  - Sides: Yukon Gold Potato Puree, Sauteed Sweet Corn, Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms- All were great. I loved how the potato puree just melted in my mouth and the sweet corn was amazing.  - Dessert: Chef's Selection which included an apple crisp, 5 types of sorbet- strawberry and I can't remember the other 4 and other delicious desserts. Wine Pairing- A muscato (my favorite of the 3!)  - My special birthday cake: Sent by Michelle A. cuz she couldn't make it with help by Po. An amazing chocolate cake with my fave, strawberries in the middle. Thank you so much you two, so delicious and reading the note made me feel so nice and loved, you guys rock!  Service was so on point the entire time. Our server Blue really was extremely accommodating and did everything to make sure we had a great time.  Thank you to Craftsteak for putting up with us, I know we were definitely on the louder side but we had a blast.   Thank you all for going and woot to a wonderful dinner at Craftsteak.",

    "text": "I had one of my Vegas dreams come True when I got to have dinner at Craftsteak. Mr. Hottie arranged the evening all I had to do is show up and look pretty! I arrived in the midst of fighting a migraine. Not good. I wasn't sneered at because I walked in with a bottle of Coke and a bottle of Excedrin as my accessories next to my purse. We were seated immediately. The table we were seated at was an end part of a VERY VERY large booth if you can picture it. So we were facing another party and were almost too close to them. I was hoping for something a little more intimate. We were left to sit for a tad too long. Nothing major, but it was noticed by both of us. I had time to go to the restroom and come back before we were greeted. Our waitress was very nice (and I forgot her name). We started out with a cocktail (glass of Prosecco for me) while we looked over the menu. Our waitress came by to check on us and to suggest that we try the Summer Tasting Menu. She even PROMISED that we would not be disappointed. At first, we thought we would pick one of each offering from each course. Wrong. We got the WHOLE menu! We went with that and added the wine pairings to go along with the courses. Let me list what was on the menu and my thoughts:  First Course  Shaved Fennel Salad: Zesty and fresh  Grilled Quail, Vincotto: Yum, very flavorful  Buffalo Mozzarella, Red Pepper Caponata: This was pretty good. Nothing earth shaking  Persian Cucumber Salad: I wasn't a huge fan, but it was personal taste more than anything.  Main Course:  Prime Beef Flatiron: This was my favorite cut of meat served medium rare and full of flavor. Very well seasoned  Angus Skirt Steak: WOW another steak! I wasn't as thrilled with this cut, surprisingly. It was still good though.  Diver Sea Scallops: Perfectly cooked. The scallops were sweet and firm.  Sides:  Yukon Gold Potato Puree: Thrilled to have had these. If you want me to be happy. Take a simple dish, and make it WELL. These were so good!  Sauteed Sweet Corn: Another winner. The corn was sweet and juicy!  Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms: Not a winner. The mushrooms seemed to be overcooked, and rubbery.  Dessert: I can't remember what it was, unfortunately. Mind you, I had wine with every course. By the end I was filled to the brim and VERY happy!  Since we were the last reservation seating for the evening, we basically shut the restaurant down. Keep in mind, this is a leisurely paced dinner, not a quick bite. Craftsteak was a wonderful experience. Not everything was perfect, but it was very close! I will go back to eat there in a heart beat! Craftsteak brings up memories of an old school steak house, but their menu items are fresh, modern and not to be missed!",

    "text": "\"Have you ever done 69?  It's the BEST.\"  It's the red head sitting at the table to the right of me talking with her girlfriends.  And no, this wasn't some metaphor for how good the steak was.  She was talking about sex.  \"What about sex when your legs in the air? The motion--it's so amazing.\"   The four of them--chic young professionals, like the crew from Sex in the City minus ten years, impeccable make-up and evening wear--could have passed for porn stars.  And no, I'm not a chauvinist.  On the table to the left of me, there were 8 salivating males, a pack of alpha dogs, peering over constantly like hungry jackals as if our table was completely transparent.  It was just a matter of time one of the guys mustered the courage to leapfrog our table and exchanged a few words with the ladies, \"Where are you ladies going tonight?  I heard great things about TAO.  Yeah, you should check out LAX.\"  He went nowhere fast.  A few minutes later a couple other guys came over from the table behind us to say hi.  Before you know it, the girls were getting free scoops of sorbet.  On the way out, two of the girls even went to another table to sit on an old guys lap and take pictures, even though his wife was at the table.  There's certainly no scarcity of meat Craftsteak.  In fact, it's a food marathon.  Dinner at Tom Colicchio's Vegas establishment was hearty to say the least.  My girlfriend took me here as a belated celebration for landing my new job.  And my, did we celebrate.  We went for the surf and turf dinner sampler for two which included kobe tartar, tiger prawns, Caesar salad, Kobe skirt steak, Kobe rib eye, a two pound lobster, and desert which included chocolate cake, ice cream, sorbet, and a sugary puff pastry with a sweet dipping sauce.  I could go on and on about the taste and presentation of each dish.  Take my word for it, it was pretty good.   The obvious problem was that we couldn't finish it all.  The waiter reaffirmed, \"Nobody ever finishes the sampler dinner.\"  That left a bittersweet taste in my mouth.  Dinner and drinks came out to four bills.  The waiter could have warned us that we had ordered enough food for three or that we were going to walk out with the most expensive doggie bag ever (luckily our hotel had a fridge).  Had we been served an adequate amount of food, I would have been a lot happier--Craftsteak loses one star for overkill.",

We decided to take advantage of this \"free\" weekend and make reservations at the renowned Craft Steak (my brother is obsessed with Top Chef). Our party of 4 ordered the Chef Tasting Menu- Kobe \"Surf & Turf\" (3 courses) at a whopping $155/person which is changed on a daily basis by the Chef.  We also ordered a bottle of $100 wine (you cant drink water with a meal like this).   1st Course Appetizer:  - Kobe Beef Tartar- amazing flavors, reminded me of ahi tuna. I loved the raw egg on top which gave it a nice rich flavor.  - Roasted Red Peppers with olive oil - Grilled shrimp - Caesar salad  Entree: -Kobe Steak  (3 types)- Rib eye, Sirloin, and Skirt Steak. All was perfectly cooked and incredibly tender. IT was my first experience with Kobe beef and I was very impressed with the quality of the meat.  - 2 Lb. Lobster sitting in a bowl of butter sauce...mmmm...butteerrrr...  Side Dishes: Grilled mushrooms, carrots (BEST EVER, perfectly cooked and sweet, this was my Mom's favorite dish), grilled asparagus, and Yukon mashed potatoes (melted in your mouth, very rich, mmm buttteerr).   Dessert: -Berry Crumble -6 diff ice creams and homemade sorbet - my dad's fave dish! He's still raving about the sorbet.  -Chocolate cake with melted chocolate in the middle - my bro's fave. - Bread pudding- MY FAVE! Very rich and perfectly baked.  - Blueberry tart   Anyways, the bill came out to a total of $900 (including tip) and we were definitely more than satisfied with our meal. Even the espresso and coffee (french pressed at your table) was incredible.   My dad asked \"So, would you come here again if we had to pay??\"  YES!",

    "text": "Great food, great service! I went with my girlfriends last week during our last night in Las Vegas.  The restaurant had a great atmosphere - quiet and intimate where we can talk and laugh without having people give us dirty looks for being too loud.   We had ordered the 32 Oz porterhouse, the Diver Sea Scallops with the shaved fennel, the potato puree and the mushroom assortment.  The steak was delicious! We had ordered it rare and it was indeed rare and not overcooked.  Only complaint was that one side of the porterhouse was quite fatty (made it feel really heavy), but other than that it was great.  The scallops were cooked perfectly.  That was probably my favourite dish! It was tender and literally melted in your mouth. I could've had a whole plate to myself.  The potato puree was creamy and I loved the chives that they put in the potatoes.  Mushroom assortment was good also as there was a good variety of mushrooms however, it could've used a bit more salt.  Nothing is worse than under seasoned dishes.  It also could've been that the other dishes we ordered had such an intense flavour that the mushrooms just sort of blended in and didn't really stand out as much. Nonetheless that dish wasn't terrible but it wasn't as outstanding as the others.  The service was great.  The waiter came to check up on us often enough (but not to the point where it was annoying).  Our water glasses were always full and they were there to walk us through the menu, recommend dishes etc.    Unfortunately we were too stuffed to even have dessert, but the dishes we ordered were enough to fill 4 of us with leftovers.  Overall great experience, and would definitely come back again!",

    "text": "Yup. So this was definitely the best meal I've had during my 29 years on this planet. My research for the best steaks in Vegas ultimately landed me at Craftsteak and boy I'm glad that research paid off. I am not even exaggerating that I didn't know food could be this good, it is really inconceivable the level this food was on.  We wanted to go big and not cut any corners, so we decided on the domestic Wagyu meal for a minimum of two people. At $170/person, they are not fooling around and my expectations were very high and they were exceeded every step of the way. Our waitress, Sharon, was extremely attentive and charming. She would stop over and see how we were doing, provided excellent information on the food which was served and really seemed to care that we were enjoying ourselves. I like to sip a cocktail when I choose to get one and Sharon asked if everything was alright with it because I was drinking so slow. I've never had someone check to see if my drink was alright, really tremendous service. Her accompanying waiter, Peter (I think, so sorry!) was also very attentive and charismatic.  Appetizer course: Wagyu beef tartare, sliced prosciutto and figs, cucumber salad, and a frisee salad with egg and bacon. Every single item was delicious but that bacon frisee salad, WOO boy. You would think a bacon grease vinaigrette would be heavy and filling, but man it was the perfect balance as a dressing for the salad. I don't usually fill up on greens or really anything before a steak meal but I pretty much ate the entire platter myself. As someone who has never tried tartare before and wouldn't normally order it, I'm glad I gave it a shot as well.  Main course: Wagyu filet, Wagyu skirt steak, pureed potato, Maui onions, seasoned broccoli. The Wagyu skirt steak lives up to the hype and then some. This was the most tender, juicy steak I've ever had. Pair the steak with the potatoes and some onion, it really was the perfect bite of food in my opinion. Portion was very generous for two people and I'm really surprised at the amount of food we were able to put down. By the end when I remembered dessert was coming, I didn't think I'd be able to eat another bite.  Dessert: If you can believe it, I somehow managed a third wind for dessert. Monkey bread, mango & raspberry sorbet, lime cheesecake, assorted fruit. While the entire dessert assortment was exceptional, the monkey bread was really something else. Amazing pull-apart pieces covered in a caramel sauce (I don't like caramel, that's how good it was), and some chopped up nuts.. what a bite. You could tell the cheesecake was made fresh in-house. The lime whipped cream garnish and pie crust added a ton of flavor.  I really cannot say enough good things about Craftsteak and our experience. Yes, it is expensive but you're getting some of the highest possible quality food in the world here. Save your allowance (and appetite) and give this place a go.",

The phone operator told us that CraftSteak was  not excepting any calls & that I would have to walk to the restaurant to let them know I would be late.  I asked than for the concierge desk, hoping to get them to help me.  I was told it was closed for the evening.  So when we got to the hotel 20 minutes late, I went straight to CraftSteak.  I explained to the hostesses what had happened.  They directed me to the manager Jim.  What a great staff.  They were wonderful, forgiving & thankful we had made it to our reservation.  Jim was kind enough to buy a glass of champagne just for us showing up & for our troubles.  It was an amazing end to our evening.",

Start with the oysters on the half shell. They are served with a great little sauce that has avocado and it is fantastic. They offer Wagyu steak and the most wonderful pork belly appetizer. It is so wonderful, you will be in heaven. The wine list is extensive and, in my opinion, over priced. Have a drink instead.  They have great deserts and the atmosphere is relaxing and quiet. Do not go there dressed in shorts. This is a fine dinning experience. Treat it as such. Enjoy.",

I had high hopes for this restaurant and they did not disappoint. More than anything, the advice was fantastic. David and Patricia were predominantly helping us, and they were both wonderful. Patricia was especially attentive and personable.   The food was terrific. My husband and I did the three course menu, Japanese wagyu. We were impressed at how many options were brought out with each course. Everything was tasty and cooked perfectly.   We would recommend dining here, but our favorite steakhouse is still Wolfgang puck's Cut in Beverly Hills. For now, this is our new vegas favorite.",

    "text": "What a difference 4 years makes....  My husband and I dined at CS for the first time 7 years ago and we had nothing but great things to say about the food and impeccable service. We returned 4 years ago and had a similar experience, which is why it's become a regular stop for us when we come to Vegas and why we recommend it to our friends and family. Times have definitely changed.  Is CS under new management?  Our first clue should have been the week it took for them to respond to an email. My husband wanted to bring a bottle of wine that was listed on their wine list, but it was a different vintage. We wanted to make sure it was ok. It took them a week to respond.   When we arrived the hostess was very nice. Our table wasn't ready so we went to the bar. There were about six people at the bar and two bartenders. No one was waiting for a drink except us. Bartender one ignored us, and wouldn't make eye contact.  He talked to one couple and started clearing and cleaning glasses. Bartender two was trying to avoid eye contact and finally acknowledged us. He made our drinks, and walked away without saying anything. Then bartender one swooped in behind him and put a check in front of us. When our table was ready, bartender one asked us if we were ready to pay the check. I said no, please transfer it to our table. I wasn't about to tip this guy directly and frankly, he should have asked if we wanted it transferred. I've waited tables, I know how it works.   Our experience with our waiter and sommelier wasn't a lot different. These guys were two of the least friendly staff I have encountered. They gave us the bare minimum in our exchanges. We had to ask for more champagne to be poured because they took the bottle from our table. Don't get me wrong. We only asked after waiting five minutes.   The final straw was the timing of dinner. We were still eating out appetizers and they brought our dinner out. Bad timing. Again I have waited tables. This isn't rocket science and these are suppose to be the best of the best here.   The rest of the staff was great, friendly. The food was top notch. But something is lacking here now. It feels like the heart is gone. One of the main reasons we come back is the service. It's been impeccable in the past. Normally I would be in the process of putting my glass down and it would be refilled. They seemed like they just weren't paying attention.   I hate to say it but I think this is our last time here. I'm happy to pay the money for a great meal as a treat for us, but I don't want to do it somewhere I don't feel welcome.   CS needs a change in management. If this was just one person having an off night, I understand. But four people. It's the culture of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Being a huge fan of Tom Colicchio's AND steak, I was excited to try out Craftsteak in the MGM on my recent visit to Vegas.    First off, expect to drop some money on this place.  But for what you spend, you will receive exceptional service and superb food.  My boyfriend and I were greeted by an incredibly warm, and friendly hostess who promptly had us taken to our table.  Immediately upon sitting down, we were greeted openly and our drink orders were taken.   Service was incredibly attentive without being push and our questions about the, somewhat, confusing tasting vs. a la carte menu were answered patiently.  We had:  The Shellfish Sampler (for two) - plenty of food for the both of us, seafood and the seaweed salad were all fresh and served with sauces which complimented the shellfish nicely; however, were not needed as the flavor was so lovely.  The dinner rolls were nothing special - honestly, they reminded me a little of the dinner rolls you can get from the store and pop in the oven at home.  Crusty on the outside, soft on the inside.    I ordered the Black Angus Filet - was cooked perfectly and was incredibly tender.   Since we live in Chicago which has its fair share of AMAZING steakhouses, I hold steak to a high standard when dining somewhere known for steak - Craftsteak did not disappoint.  I continued to eat the filet long after I was full simply because it tasted that good.  My boyfriend got the Seafood Trio and generously shared one of his scallops with me.  He managed to happily devour everything else on his plate; however, the scallop I did try was out of this world - the scallop could be cut with the side of your fork and simply melted in your mouth.    Besides the mains, we decided to try to Brussels Sprouts -  The Brussels were cooked to a perfect tender-crisp and the bacon was a wonderful compliment.  I highly recommend Craftsteak if you are looking for an upscale steakhouse while you are in Vegas.",

And it was magic.  I can definitely say it was the best steak I've eaten.  More tender than any filet I've ever had and richer than any ribeye.  My wife loved it so much that she legitimately got steak drunk.  We're not usually a dessert ordering couple, but the steak was so damn amazing I thought I'd roll the dice on the toffee monkey bread and brown sugar sour cream ice cream.  Again, it was magic.  I loved it.  I got a bit full towards the end, but soldiered on because it would be unpatriotic to waste a bite of this food.  Food aside, we loved the staff.  Everyone was so incredibly friendly and helpful.  The busser who bagged our left overs even threw in extra rolls in case we wanted to make sandwiches.  Those little details make all the difference.    The perfect meal does come with a hefty price tag, but it was well worth it for the overall experience.  I'll do this meal every time I'm in Vegas.    Do yourself a favor and make a reservation here.  I have yet to find a nice steakhouse anywhere that even comes close to the overall experience you get at Craftsteak.",

We started off 6 oysters, and ended up ordering more oysters after we finished our first six. They were so fresh and delicious. It was her first time having oysters, and she enjoyed. We then split the bone in rib eye cooked medium, with a side of the potato puree and asparagus. The steak was very juicy, even cooked at medium ( I usually get medium rare when I'm not sharing) and the charred flavor was awesome. The side dishes whet well with the steak, especially when you drench them in the steak juice. Now the part I would like to elaborate on was the exceptional service I received from every staff member. From the hostess to all of the staff at the front of the house that provided us with service; they paid exquisite attention to detail and were so friendly and hospitable. Thank you for making this a dining experience to remember. 5/5 for food and service",

They weren't too thick or too thin and had butter and garlic. The carrots were a variety of purple, white and orange and glazed with honey. They were sweet like candy. The potatoes were a little salty but, cooked perfectly. I liked the little potato balls. The bread they serve looks like rolls but, tasted like croissants. Yum! I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Instead of telling us the fries tastes like Red Robin wedges, he said they were the best thing since sliced bread. 2nd, for a high-end restaurant, you already pay a premium for the food. You don't expect to be nickel and dimed for the customer service. There was a photographer walking around offering to take the picture for each table. However, she will not take it with your camera. For the price we paid, we assume the picture will be given as a memento. Nope, each print cost $25. This is a high-end restaurant, not a county fair or amusement park. Charging for instant polaroid is tacky. We will not be back.",

    "text": "I never ever thought this day would come. This was my reference restaurant. I compared everything to this place. It has been my go to place for years.  I have been going there since it opened. I have had many many many tastings there and they were all above and beyond. In fact I walked out of certain restaurant in LV and they fixed it. The male Gm has on more than one occasion made me very happy.   Tonight however. Came in for a late night dinner. Intention of sharing an A5 wagyu NY strip, foie grass and some sides.  Not very hungry, but upwards of 350-400 dollars for a meal. Ok so the server idk his name.  Convinced me to get a A5 tasting.  Like he should.  Upsell best you can.  I bought in. And ordered.    Food comes and at first a small table side lobster bisque comes alone. Immediately after it hitting the table a huge plate of prosciutto, a warm frisse salad and some other salad. Ok soup 2 salads and a cured meat.  My entire table had no more room.  I stopped the expo, and said we have a tasting menu which he responded \"yeah these are the apps\" and continues to drop food.  I said \" if you were sitting would you want all your food to be dropped at the same time. He said no then I said take some of this away.  What do you expect me to do with ALL THIS FOOD?   He says don't eat it all. I'm shocked.  Crazy amounts of food for a tasting.  The server returns and I say\" just charge me for what I ate.  And we will go somewhere else. Anyways the AGM. Female is making all kinds of gestures and when I approach her.  She was acting like a 12 year old.   And getting loud. People all looking at me like I assaulted her. She's getting louder and louder. Calling the GM from across the room.  He approached and She dismissed me like I wanna nobody. Soooo.  I just said. We just want to leave. I had a Diet Coke and am willing to pay for it. He said it's ok. I left.   Those of you who know me, know I don't lie or embellish my reviews.  I will never  return to this place.  For what would've been at least a 1k meal. Don't treat me like I don't matter.    Hope someone important sees this.  Such a shame on how one persons bad night can ruin a whole experience.",

We ordered some Frank Family Cab+ some Prisoner Cab to pair.   It was all stellar.  We were overstuffed, but soooo happy.  We ordered the bone in rib eye, scallops, mushroom mix, Caesar salad, the potato puree, lobster bisque and some other things that were top notch.  Service was the best.

I went with a mixture of ladies of varying foodie strengths.  We ate steak and potatoes and corn and it was all delicious.  We had the frisee salad and it was wonderful, a bit heavy on the dressing but it worked.  The tar tare was very good.  The bread rolls are also very very yummy.  The steaks are large and we all loved everything.  The braised ribs made my poor crock pot ribs seem like peasant food. The potato puree was yummy, we had a nice discussion on it's consistency and I think I would have liked it a bit thicker but other people preferred it's thinner consistency.  Drinks and wine were enjoyed and it was a merry old time.  Not sure we'll be back but I do recommend this place.  The bar area when you walk in is nice, a bit more causal than main dining room and would be good for impromptu visit.",

My husband took me here for my birthday and the restaurant seated us in a corner booth which was nice. The feel of Craft is swanky and upscale. The real stand out was the monkey bread dessert that I'll dream of forever.  We started with some tasty cocktails that hit the spot. The hot buns and butter arrived. I loved how the bread was served, especially that it arrives warm and buttery.   For my entree I had the filet which was flavorful and tender. My husband had the bison which is a less tender meat, but he enjoyed the taste. I tried some, but didn't find it to be my cup of tea. We shared broccoli and scalloped potatoes. The broccoli was cooked well and the potatoes were really yummy. We definitely killed the potatoes.   Dessert is a must and was definitely my favorite part of the whole meal. The monkey bread was to die for and would make dining here worth it.   This is an above average restaurant with above average service and food.",

    "text": "Very disappointing! I've been to many high end steak houses in the Mid West and Craftsteak would not rank in the top 10.  The good : All the sides we tried were very good. But at $15-$22, the sides should be good. The risotto was the favorite. The mashed potatoes are also very good. The Caesar's salad was a classic with real anchovies.   Service was decent but a little slow at times  The bad : I had the grilled NY strip bone in ordered medium. After a lengthy wait. The steak came out way past medium. I sent it back. After another 15 minutes another steak came cooked properly. My wife finished her meal however before my second steak came. But the steak was the worst $50 steak I've ever had. For a dry age steak it was very tough. Even with the steak knife it was hard to cut. Most high end steakhouses will trim the gristle and fat from the outside of the steak but not here. I only ate half of my steak.   They offered nothing for the inconvenience, no free desserts or discounts on the meal. Just a sorry.   We made reservations at 7:45pm. There are plenty of tables available when we called. We got seated next to the bar, in the bar really. Terrible seats! Loud and constantly getting bumped by people at the bar.   This is not what i expected from a Tom Colichio restaurant.",

    "text": "A top tier steakhouse serving proper man size cuts of phenomenal beef.    Top tier?  IMHO there are four in Vegas: Craftsteak, Cut, Prime, Stripsteak.  All offer a great variety of cuts, breeds, providence, and aging that showcase the best flavor of each.  All beef, well trimmed and cooked perfectly to temp with a great sear every time served in a steakhouse proper environment.  Solid but simple sides and a killer wine list a must.  That said, the steaks:  14-28 day dry aged USDA Prime steaks and butchers cuts (rib eye, porterhouse, t-bone, NY strip, filet, flat iron, hanger, skirt), domestic wagyu, and Japanese A5.   Go with a group, order several and share.  Quality and flavor speak for themselves.  You can't go wrong with any.  Top props to the dry aged porterhouse with its brooding beefy flavor, Snake River flat iron for its very tender yet sweet and meaty flavor, and the A5 rib cap with its very sweet, unctuous mouth feel and clean beef finish.  Best kept secret?  24 hour braised beef short rib.  Perfect.  Meltingly tender without being stringy.  Well glazed.  Caramelized flavors with a beefy core.  Hard to pass.  Simple sides that compliment the steaks.  Do not pass on the mushroom assortment.  Shitake, French horn, white beech and hen of the woods all simply sauteed.  Toothsome, wonderfully earthy flavor that adds an umame punch to all the dry aged steaks.  Carrots in a lightly citrusy local honey and butternut squash in a bourbon maple glaze heightens the metallic flavor, the sweet sour Maui onions add a wonderful earthiness and enhances the natural sweetness.  Relatively standard salads and starters if you must.  The warm frisee with egg and smoked bacon a great way to whet your palate for the carnivorous meal to come.  Good selection of very fresh oysters.  Craftsteak boasts the best selection of single malts in the city.  10-50 year, page after page of whiskeys.  As an aperitif, paired with the meal or a night cap.  Indulge.  A great wine list with many non-American producers offers great alternatives for those wanting something more traditional.  Vegas resort pricing.  Outstanding steakhouse friendly and proper service.  Advance reservations a must.  Dining at the bar is an alternative but be warned, it gets crowded during the peak of dinner service.  Visit after visit, Craftsteak delivers.  Worthy.",

    "text": "The WORST $400 meal ever. If I had paid $50 for this meal I would have been sorely disappointed.  First, the steak and seafood. The Hangar steak was cooked into tasteless charred little chunks. The NY Strip was sub-par. I guess they are known for serving everything in a pan so the customer is responsible for scraping the food off the pan and into the plate. That was surprising and unappealing. Plating food is part of the fine dining experience. Schlepping an $80 steak off a pan and into your plate as the grease spatters onto your clothes is strange.The diver scallops were delicious. So yay?  The sides: The french fries were chunky and soggy. The Hen of the Woods mushroom was literally just mushrooms thrown on a plate. No seasoning, no sauce.... NOTHING. The potato puree was decent, but unimaginative. Same for the charcuterie. We asked for one extra roll and they added a charge for \"extra cheese\" $4 to our bill. Cheesy.  After dinner: Our French dinner guest asked for a \"little coffee\" at the end of her meal and they brought her a huge french press of coffee. After dinner. At 11 o'clock at night. WTH? Our waiter brought us some complimentary cookies at the end, which were chocolate chip cookies that tasted like they were straight out of a paper box.Then our waiter just disappeared. Never saw him again. We couldn't get anyone to close out our tab or help us. We waited a solid 20 minutes and then flagged a couple waiters down to help us wrap up.   This meal was so bad it made my husband angry. The disappearing waiter act was pretty crazy too. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone and by the recent reviews, it seems like the sub-par food and service is a problem there right now. Try another spot.",

Working in the service industry - even if it is a bug, DONT tell me it is!  Good lord.  We started off with cocktails and the beef tartar which was delicious.  The flavor was amazing!   I had filet mignon which was great and for sides we had the potatoes au gratin.  We had the monkey bread for dessert which was out of this world!  It basically melted in your mouth.  The way the restaurant is laid out it made for a social dining experience and we ended up chatting with the tables around us which was fun!

Great selection of cuts and sides and drinks (and non-steaks for those who prefer other options).  The steaks were perfectly seasoned and prepared, and an absolute joy to eat.  Sure, you're going to pay top dollar... but that's the case for pretty much any place on the Strip, and this is one of the few I would want to re-visit.  In the world of steakhouses, Craftsteak is a winner.",

There are really no words actually, just moments of pure silence....food porn now completely understood. My husband and I went to Carnevinos @ the Venetian in January and although the dinosaur steak we had there was good, the steaks here were FAR more superior in flavor. Everything we had, the flavors were just enhanced tenfold, never masking what the natural dish was. Food will never be the same, we all need therapy now. Everyone had a great time and we will make a trip out just to eat here again.",

The dinner was for a personal celebration and the bill easily came up to 200.  We each ordered a steak and shared a side of asparagus.  I had one beer, the other person, a wine.  My steak came out great (a T-Bone) and was prepared medium.  The person I was with ordered a filet and it came well done instead of medium as ordered.  They re-made the steak for her but a bit of a bummer.  We started with appetizers of oysters.  The quality of the food was fantastic and this is a great place to wine and dine in either a business meeting or a personal party but be prepared to pay premium prices for the location and quality of the cuisine.",

Steaks start at $40 and up.  Even though this is a steakhouse they have delicious scallops and seafood. I am pretty sure everything on the menu is organic and farm raised. My favorite sides are the potato au gratin and the Brussels sprouts.   If you want to splurge do the tasting menu (it will run you about $150 ish but it's worth it). It is plenty of food and changes depending on what the chef wants to serve.  It's best to choose this option if everyone at the table wants to do the tasting menu (I think they don't want people to order one and share with the whole table).  The ambiance is very elegant without being pretentious.  It is also great for large groups.",

The bartender was incredibly knowledgeable and gave me a great glass of wine. Once seated the waiter took us through their menu point by point and made us feel very comfortable with everything.   We ended up going with a tasting menu with the Japanese Wagu beef. It started with a salad tasting menu. Each was better then the last. We probably got full just on the salads!!! The next course was the beef with the sides. We got the New York Strip and a Filet. The sides were the asparagus, mushrooms, and the mashed potatoes. Everything was melt in your mouth amazing, including the beef!!! I don't think I've ever eaten a steak that good and I don't think I ever will. When dessert came we were almost comatose with the amount of food we had already had so we just took it to go and went to our suite and enjoyed it later. Once we had digested a little of our amazing dinner!!!  A must go to while you're in Vegas!! Can't wait to try the Craft in LA!!!",

So we decided Tom Colicchio might know a thing or two about steak. Therefore if you are a steak connoisseur, look at someone else's review!   Pros: Very nice casual atmosphere  My water glass was always filled... always... like if I just think about my water I see a water person waiting in the corner ready to refill my glass  Very little noise,  not like creepy deserted quietness, more like a nice low murmur.   Waiter and all the staff we met were very kind and courteous about everything  Cons:  I don't know if it'll be too memorable. The food was good, the service was good but when I come back to Vegas again I'm not going to be like \"I have GOT to go to Craftsteak, like OMG gurl.\"  4 stars",

The following was ordered:  Wine: Pinot Noir, Patricia Green Cellars, Reserve, 2007: VERY smooth, and I'm not customary to drinking reds. Currently searching for this wine in San Diego, I enjoyed it this much...  Craftsteak Chef's Winter Tasting:   Appetizers: -Grilled Quail with Vincotto: YUM, this was the best appetizer dish out of the 4. Tasted like game hen. Spices were up to par on this dish.  -Buffalo Mozzarella Cheese and Red Pepper Caponata: I enjoyed this cool appetizer. My 2nd fav...  -Mixed Baby Lettuces: Just a regular cucumber salad to me, but refreshing.  -Shaved Fennel Salad: Tasted just like pickled, crunchy noodles. Not a fan...  Main Course: Grilled Angus Skirt Steak: Medium rare, juicy, and very tasty! 2 different cuts of beef and both were excellent.  Roasted Flat Iron Steak: Medium rare, and also very juicy and tasty!  Diver Sea Scallops: Huge pieces and delectable!   Sides: Yukon Gold Potato Puree: Smooth and buttery Baby Shiitake Mushrooms: Great over the steaks, however, very scrumptious alone  Roasted Brussels Sprouts: Could do without   Dessert: Chocolate Souffle Hot Fudge Sauce & Caramel Ice Cream: DELICIOUS!!! I was in chocolate heaven!!! Vanilla Bean Cheesecake Blueberries & Lemon Poppy Seed Tuile: I'm a fan, although I loved the souffle the best!!!  The service was excellent, and everyone was very friendly, proper and helpful. I heard that this place gets packed, and for a week night, it was getting there. Enjoyed my experience, and hope to come back soon!",

We were a bachelorette party of 4 ladies who were on a time crunch as we had tickets to see Boyz II Men at the Mirage at 7:30. One of the great things about this restaurant is that you can make a reservation via Yelp/Open Table or on their website. And our time was 5:45, I believe.   For appetizers, we tried the Diver Sea Scallops. I LOVED THESE. They were so flavorful and perfectly seasoned. So perfectly cooked as well! Honestly out of the world, and certainly the best scallops I have ever had. It's definitely a dish you must have and try whilst here.  We also had the organic lettuces with lemon vinaigrette. Good salad, but very large pieces. I didn't care too much for the lemon, but that's on me and not on the restaurant.  I split the Free Range Chicken au jus with my girl friend and that was moist and tender. Seasoned very well. We had french fries and the Brentwood sweet corn as sides. French fries were your typical french fries, nothing extremely special, but still delicious. That corn, however, also amazing! Never thought to saute corn and green onions together, but it was innovative to me, haha. The seasonings they used were on point though.   Very immaculate service from the chefs and staff. I would go back again and again if I lived in Vegas. We were in a rush for our show, so our poor waiter was rushed by us. We tipped him generously though and hoped he didn't think we hated his service, he was excellent. He even brought us dessert and congratulated my bride friend.",

This was probably amazing in 2002 when it opened...  ...but, I think the more recent hotels on the Strip learned from the MGM and really raised the bar.  The steaks at Craftsteak were good, but the overall environment, experience, and location just can't compete with the likes of Prime, the SW steakhouse, Botero, the Eiffel Tower restaurant, etc.  The tables near the entrance felt like eating in a mall.  Just didn't work for me.",

We ate at Craftsteak and Gordon Ramsay steak.  Craftsteak was the Hands Down winner in every category!   Food was incredible.  The cheese grits were to die for.  Steaks were simple and well cooked.  Food presentation was lovely.  Monkey bread for dessert was yummy!!    Where Craftsteak really stood out was in service.  The servers used a partner system, which worked great.  I believe our two servers were Marlon and Bleu.  One spent time walking us through the menu and the other took our order.  I liked this approach because it allowed one to make recommendations and the other took the order so you didn't feel badly if you didn't take their recommendations.     Overall, fantastic experience at Craftsteak - will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas and will certainly be recommending to friends.",

We went full out and did the Chef's Beef Selection and went for the Australian A5 Wagyu that was served family style. Yes, we had salad, sides, dessert, and even two selections of beef with the whole experience. What all of the details were, however, are all a blur. The main focus was the beef and I must say it was quite amazing.  It was cooked to perfection and the texture and taste were something I have never experienced before. The service was extremely friendly and attentive as well. Bottom line it certainly exceeded my expectations and I would definitely do it again though if I did I think I would try to change it up a bit -- maybe the surf and turf? Who knows, I just would not want to wreck any exaggerated memories that build up over time for the meal we had since it is going to be hard, very hard, to match the experience again.",

Huge fan of top chef, and when I discovered tom collichio owned this place I just had to try it for our big saturday night meal.  We are all big foodies.  And no, I was not wearing a veil and tiara or any blinking jewelry.  We are all in our late 20s early 30s and were well behaved, at least til the end of the night when we had consumed several martinis and bottles of vino.  We may have been laughing loudly but we never got rowdy...and we were practically in a PDR for chrissake so I could've mooned the table next to me and only about a dozen or so people might see.  Not that I would.  Just sayin, we were hidden away.  All that being said...service was freaking awful.  Our server was an older gentleman, and he was downright rude.  If 18% gratuity had not been tacked on, I honestly might have gone 15% (which I NEVER do being a former server and bartender myself..I have maybe done this once in my life!).  I ordered the surf & turf - a splurge - but usually one of my favorite things to eat.   The filet was a tad undercooked for medium rare, but I kinda like it in between rare and med rare so it was fine by me.  One of my friends couldn't handle it!  The lobster was so rubbery and chewy and coldish and flavorless...did it come out of the fridge?   Side dishes bored me (and everyone).    My opening salad was good - but only because we shared a ton of starters and I mixed the mozzarella salad with the tomato salad to make my own caprese.  I think one of my friends enjoyed her short ribs.  Nobody raved about anything.  Except maybe the hot sticky buns that come out in the beginning.  Truly sad we did not enjoy it!  Should've eaten elsewhere.  Will not return.",

They have an extensive selection of choice scotch and burbon that you dont see many places, as well as a wine selection that will wow even the most seasoned drinkers. We all decided to go with the domestic Wagyu tasting menu ($130.00 per person) and the result was nothing short of phenominal. The chef selects the best available cuts, sides, salads, apps and deserts but asks you before hand if there is anything you cant live without and  anything you allergic to or dont want. They brought out the salads and sides first: great buffalo mozzerella with 25 yr old balsalmic, ceaser, confit with bacon and blue cheese, arugala, etc....everything awsome. Next came the steaks and sides: Hangar, New York, Fillet, braised short ribs, T-Bone (enough for 10 people) along with asparagus, 4 different types of mushrooms, beets, potatoes....the list goes on and on. When the waiter came by and told us to make sure and leave room for dessert everyone laughed and gave him the old \"yeah...right\" look, then the desserts came out. Lava Cake, Eight different types of ice cream and sorbet, cheescake, monkey bread and fruit plate (all some of the best desserts Ive ever had). We all left feeling full and if I had one complaint about this place is that we ate so much no one wanted to go to the foundation room after we were dome because everyone was so stuffed. The service was spot on and despite being very crowded, everyone got taken care of promptly when they had a request. Tom Collichio should be very proud to be the owner of this joint, I have told several people since I have been back that it was definetely one of the best meals I have had in my life!",

The rest of the cuts were just ok.  For the money you spend here, I would expect all the cuts to be at least \"good\" if not \"great.\"  I would not recommend this restaurant to steak lovers.  You're better off going to the SW Steakhouse at the Wynn.",

Excellent table, service and vibe (a little busy). Superb wine list. This is a great place to take a date or have dinner with friends. If you stay away from the Kobe menu the steak menu prices are very competitive $35-$50 depending on the cut. Craftsteak is highly recommended.",

My issue was that the three of us came to restaurant ready to spend money on a fantastic meal and the entire meal felt rushed.  Our server made it clear that the kitchen was super \"slammed' and made us feel as though we didn't have the luxury of time to enjoy the various courses of our meal.    He almost audibly sighed when we decided to order extra oysters and one of the servers had a conniption fit in front of us when he came to the table and saw that we were still eating our apps.  To top it all off - we decided that we would do a \"taste test\" between the Kobe Rib Eye and the \"regular\" filet.  It was very disappointing to say that while both steaks were good there was no wow factor for either.   Then we discover that our original server left without introducing the new server.  It was very obvious that the staff were ready for us to leave and this was disappointing since we spent quite a bit of money there and weren't really made to feel welcome.   We left not talking about the great food - but about the disappointment we felt.",

After asking us which appetizers and cuts we were particularly interested in, our waiter proceeded to bring us four full appetizers, two 10-12oz steaks, and three deserts. He remarked to us, \"we don't like to do those down-sized tasting portions like french restaurants.\". I'll say! Everything was delicious--probably the best steak house food we've ever had, including not only the melt-in-your-mouth amazing filet mignon, but knock-your-socks-off sides of roasted corn, creamy mashed potatoes, and mixed mushrooms--and the service was impeccable, but on reflection I wish they'd given us slightly less food and charged us slightly less money. When the food is that expensive (and yummy), you really want to eat it all, but no one should really eat that much in one meal, even if it's by Tom Colicchio.",

The steak was good as well, i got Filet Mignon for 56$ and my girlfriend got the short ribs. There was only two issues I had with the restaurant. The ambience and decor was lacking in my opinion, and although the steak was good, I would have liked to have had something more than just a piece of meat, perhaps with some type of dressing, or culinary work done to it other than just cooking it. The sides are also pretty plain. I would go again, but just for the salads.",

    "text": "We went to Craftsteak on Christmas Day for dinner. We had eight people in our party, so we were able to sample a variety of items. We had reservations at 5:45 pm and were seated promptly.  Setting: the restaurant itself was very attractive and pleasant. Noise level: average for a higher end restaurant. Wait staff: Friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. Were not overly intrusive and were willing to split the bill in half, giving us two separate charges. Food: Very good to excellent. Tried veal, ribeye (both the individual 16 oz and the 32 oz, bison, hanger steak, and veal. Got the quail, Maui onions, asparagus, sweet potato and mashed potatoes. The dessert was chocolate, monkey bread, and sorbet. As mentioned overall the food was terrific. The only marginal item was the bison. Three people ordered the bison and one of the three was bit overcooked. The best item was the hanger steak, really juicy, tender, and tasty. Having been Ruth Chris, Morton's, and a variety of high end steakhouse in our local area, I think that the quality of the food (main course and sidedishes) at Craftsteak is a least one or two notches above these other establishments. Cost: Average of $80 per person-without any alcohol. In summary, if you want a really good steak and are willing to pay the price, Craftsteak is a good choice. The four stars is for the quality of the food (very high) and the cost(also very high). Would have given it 5 stars if the cost had been $10-20 less per person.",

So so fun to go here with a group of friends and get the tasting menu.  Just like some of the other reviewers said, it is a great meal for sharing.  Service is great, food is great, and the cornucopia of desserts that come out leads to a very festive time.  Pricing for the tasting menu is pretty strong but they have a right to be proud imho.  I wish I could give you more specifics but it's been a minute since I've been there and quite a few rough nights of drinking in between.",

Being a lover of rib eye steak, I have to say the skirt and flat iron steaks were very nice.  The corn has got to be the best corn my husband and I have ever tasted.  Mashed potatoes were a little buttery, but still very pleasant indeed.  Cheesecake, amazing with thin graham crust.  (I don't like thick crusts, overpowers cheesecake for me)  So much food, though.

It's not really a tasting menu since they give you full sized portions for each dish.  After having bread and the first three dishes of the first course, I was pretty satisfied.  The diver scallops from this course were the best I've ever had, truly amazing.  The next course was delicious murder on my stomach.  There was just so much food.  We had 2 steaks (the strip was fantastic), potato puree, assorted and grilled shrooms and corn.  Everything was well executed and simple, showcasing the exceptional quality of the ingredients.  Thankfully the dessert stomach kicked in because we were given 4 full sized desserts.  A truly divine bread pudding, 4 scoops of delicious gellato, a wonderful cheesecake with cumquats and a bowl of blackberries.  The bread pudding was a serious stand out.  My wife, who hates bread pudding, wouldn't stop eating it.  I had to clamor to get my share.  There goes my playstation 3 money, but like I said, no regrets.",

We ordered the braised short ribs and hangar steak with a side of the yukon gold potato puree. The food was absolutely excellent and we could not from taking bite after bite. We also celebrated our anniversary here. They shared with us a nice desert plate of chocolates with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on the plate with chocolate sauce. For desert we ended up trying the monkey bread dish and it was just as excellent as the main course. One con with the restaurant is the photo person who comes around to all the tables and asks to take your picture and then tries to haggle with you later to purchase the picture they had just taken with you. The picture is nearly priced as much as an entree...ridiculous. We definitely want to come back and experience more of the menu. We would also love to try the desert tasting here too.",

We've hit a them all on the strip, but this is the first time I've been truly disappointed. They were out of a few of the items on the drink menu. The steaks were mediocre at best. In particular the prime NY strop was extremely bad. No flavor at all and there was so much fat and connected tissue that I couldn't even eat 3/4 of it. Upon telling the staff, they were in different. No apology or effort to make it right.  I've had better steaks and service at your middle of the road steak chain on the side of the highway. I would not return and would recommend going elsewhere. On top of everything else they have a photographer walking thru taking pictures of you like you are at an amusement park...quite tacky!  Go",

Between the four of us we had the 10oz fillet with lobster, the T-bone with lobster, lobster bisque, fingerling potatoes and asparagus and drinks.  I personally had the 10oz fillet with lobster. I would rate the steak a 7 out of 10. Ordered it medium, it came medium to medium well with the outer part more on the med-well to well side (tough to cut, which should never happen with a fillet).  Overall I would say it was a fairly good meal, not great. I would, however, like to point out a glaring issue I had with the restaurant. I would consider this to be fine dining as our bill was over $400 with tip. In any fine dining restaurant, your tables should not be placed 4 feet from the bar. I had guys yelling in my ear and was elbowed in the head (some may say I deserved it...). We did see other tables experiencing this same issue. In my opinion, this is poor restaurant layout, but something that could be easily fixed if they chose to do so. It put a definite damper on the night.  Enjoy!",

The problem was with the service and our steaks.  Four of the seven people at our table disliked their steaks. My steak in particular was overcooked, dry and under seasoned, which is so odd because the sides were seasoned so well. I expected more from a $60 steak. Our Swiss waiter also started off so personable but once we got our food that ended. Not one person came by to ask how our meal was. The last very strange thing that happened was when I mentioned that I wanted the Peach Sorbet as a dessert the waiter seemed unimpressed. Several people at our table made the observation also. It was if there was a non-verbal cue that I should not order the Peach.   Go to Bouchon. That meal was amazing and the service was excellent.",

I partook of the chilled shellfish sampler and the harris ranch ribeye. favored sides were the sauteed spinach and the nantes carrots (which were roasted with local desert honey and were excellent!)   the meat was done to a perfect medium rare throughout, and the shellfish was fresh and delicious. i suppose my only complaint would be that the shellfish platter was skimpy (but then when isn't it at restaurants like this)? portion size aside, the food was of amazing quality. a month later, i still distinctly remember being wowed by the texture of the lobster tail and the freshness of the crab meat that was included in the platter. =)   overall - an amazing dining experience (the service and the ambience were fantastic)... only ding would be that the price point is just a tad too much on the high side for what it delivers (as great as it is).",

    "text": "I cannot believe that I almost made a reservation at another steak house and missed the opportunity to eat the best meal I have ever had.  We hit this place on our second night in town - before a comedy show in the same Hotel.  Literally, the deciding factor when I made reservations for the trip was that it was close to the show, so we would not be rushed.  Thank God I did.  We went with the American Waygu tasting menu and were deluged with plates and plates of food.  (and this was after the yummy parker rolls of which we ate at least two portions)  To start:  buffalo mozz with red peppers, caesar salad, shrimp cocktail and the yummy wagyu tartare.  Every bit of this was gone and all was delicious.  For the meal, they bring you a ribeye and a filet with creamy mashed potatoes and snap peas.  Again, there were maybe a few snap peas left, but we devoured the rest -and the meat was perfectly cooked and so good - husband even admitted that he might like the ribeye more than the filet (which is his cut of choice)  For dessert, there were FOUR more plates - a creamy chessecake, two scoops of gelato, monkeybread and a fruit tray.  Husband ate all of the monkeybread before I could blink and thus, I took the cheesecake for myself.  Service was also spot on and we had no problem making the show around the corner.This is a MUST for any serious foodie out there - don't balk at the almost $500 per couple pricetag, it is worth it for the sheer joy of food!",

I travel a lot and every where I go always end up eating at least 1 steak restaurant. I order a Kobe wagyu (note to everyone) Kobe steak does exist but it comes from certain type or cows. It was $270 and that's someones week paycheck but it was worth it (order medium or medium rare). I would describe it as eat foie gras of steak... very rich flavored. I also had a piece of the local filet and when you do order this have them slice it for you. I have eaten here 3-4 times and I will always come back when I crave steak. Getting it comped is a plus for me.",

    "text": "Oh man I'm so glad I finally got a chance to try this restaurant! Came here last night for dinner. I made a reservation so the hostess was prompt and seated us right away in a booth! We had several waiters throughout the meal, from the person bringing our wine, taking our order, bringing out the food, to checking up on our meal. I thought it wasn't even overbearing and they all came at perfect times during the meal to check up on us.   I got a pineapple upside cake cocktail to start. It was sooo tasty! Almost literally like drinking the cake itself. The server brought out these mini parkhouse dinner rolls in this small cast iron pan. Totally cute!! We ordered a charcuterie selection plate to start off our meal. That came with some mini pretzel rolls and a variety of mustards and sauces to eat with either the charcuterie or the pretzels.   So we decided to try this \"wagyu\" beef I always hear about. My husband and I got the 12oz domestic wagyu skirt steak to split and a side of broccolini with garlic. When that came out, it was cooked medium rare like we asked. My first bite into the steak, heavenly!! The fattyness of the steak and the flavor was just soo good. 12 oz was a good choice to share. I LOVED the broccolini, delicious and went well with our steak.   When we finished our meal, the waiter brought us two chocolate ganache tarts as my complimentary birthday present. Very intense chocolate. Knowing how well everything tasted that night even with the complimentary dessert, I knew I still wanted to order off their dessert menu.  My husband and I decided to get the chocolate souffle. It was really the best evenly cooked chocolate souffle. Came to table piping hot with the caramel chocolate sauce on the side and chocolate chip ice cream. The souffle was moist and very light but definitely filling.   But the end of our meal, the chef came out to see how everything tasted and as part of my birthday gave me a copy of the menu I ordered from for that night. I thought that was a really nice touch.  I will definitely add this to my \"to eat again and again\" list when I go back to Vegas. Tom Colicchio did a great job with the concept and the Chef there executed all the dishes in a simple and extremely tasty way.",

We had show tickets for David Copperfield so we had an earlyish dinner reservations on a Saturday night.  When the hostess originally went to seat us, she put us in a very cattle call like table seated right next to one of the few only people in the restaurant.  Since it was my bday I asked her if we could possibly get a booth for a little more ambiance.  I am so glad I asked.  We were seated in a booth in the back corner.  It was perfect.  Although there were other people dining, it really felt as though we had the whole place to ourselves.  The servers were incredible and the food was amazing.  To top it off, they brought me out a special bday treat for dessert.    Overall this was a fantastic night.  Thank you.",

We decided to go with the chef's tasting menu and went with the Domestic Wagyu Filet and Ribeye-both were amazing, melt in your mouth delicious.  They were the perfect medium rare and my husband and I both agreed they were among the best steaks we have had.  Our starters were the goat cheese dish with ratatouille (we LOVED it-great flavor, very complex), the Avocado Salad (also loved it, very tangy!), the pork belly (not our favorite) and Heirloom Tomatoes (we are not tomato people, but still thought this salad was perfectly seasoned and delicious).  Along with our steak we were served the Potato Puree (very good, but we aren't potato people either, very creamy!) and Brentwood Sweet Corn (so amazingly delicious we can't even describe it, tasted like popcorn, very fresh, sweet and slightly crunchy) and a mushroom assortment (just okay).  For dessert we had carmel monkey bread, fresh made sorbet, cheesecake with fresh vanilla whipped cream and a fresh fruit assortment-all were delicious, sweet and perfectly prepared.  It was a ton of food, but we did a good job:)  The food presentation was meticulous and so was the service.  We can't wait to go back the next time we are in Vegas and have already recommended it to all of our Vegas loving friends!",

    "text": "I was anticipating going to this restaurant for my friend's bday since she wanted a \"Vegas\" birthday. Well, I'm sad to say that I've had better.  First, the amazing: The service from this restaurant was impeccable! The staff was always on hand to bring more bread and fill our water glasses.  Second, the food: I love steak. Going to Craftsteak only made sense! I ordered the 16oz Ribeye since the tasting menu wasn't available.. (that was disappointing) If I had to choose a cut of meat, I would say that Ribeye is my absolute favorite.. except I feel like this restaurant was disappointing, especially since this is Tom Colicchio's restaurant. When I got my plate of meat, it was already cut, and a little TOO RESTED where my meat was borderline cold.. a definite first for me. Second, I had some of my friend's diver scallops and I tasted a lot of GRIT/SAND as I was chewing the scallop. It didn't help that it also had a fishy smell/flavor.   I'm totally doing this out of order, but I also got the frisee salad.. it was definitely too salty and overpowered by the large clumps of goat cheese. I'm a girl that loves to finish her food, but even I couldn't finish this salad since it was too strong.   Dessert - Had the pear/cranberry crumble.. not bad, but not great  The best part of my meal would've been the bread which tastes and looks like a King's Hawaiian roll, but with a crispy outside and warm tender inside. YUM.. and I did enjoy the mushroom medley, yukon mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts.. YUMMMY..  Conclusion: I was overall disappointed.. I guess the expectation is, if you're a judge on Top Chef, I would expect the entrees (especially steak if it in the restaurant title) to be much better than the contestants'. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.. and I would much rather go to Stefan's LA Farm.. any day.  Sorry Tom.. but I'm still a fan of you as a person! :)",

It was the tastiest cut of meat between the 4 dishes my friends & I ordered. My next favorite was the braised short ribs.  I thought my steak was OK....the first one came out bleeding so I sent it back. The second steak (a brand new cut of meat) was a bit on the chewy side. I think they don't season it too much so you can really just enjoy the beef flavor (a la Arnie Morton's).  Aside from the Hangar, the sides also won me over....I got the Sunchokes (Jerusalem Artichokes! Remember when Harold cooked with them in the Napa challenge in the previous season?) and they went well with the meat. My friend ordered the sauteed wild mushrooms & they were really really good too!  The service here is fantastic and I really enjoyed the atmosphere & decor of the place. They were so kind to us & even gave us a creme brulee with fresh vanilla beans on the house to share! (I ordered the Meyer Lemon sorbet which was painfully sour....so if you don't like sour...stay away from it!)",

It included:  quail- tasty, moist, cooked perfectly salad- average beets- delicious scallop- sweet, perfectly cooked flat iron steak- one of the best steaks I've had, drenched in a buttery sauce skirt steak- again very good Monkey bread- very good  chocolate cake- warm served with ice cream  There was tons of food.  They didn't skimp on the wine either, 3 full glasses.  thogh...I think I would have preferred just buying a single bottle that I liked.  The wines were OK.  Would have given this place 5 stars easily, however we had reservations at 9... didn't get seated till 9:45.  The hostess said that if we had drinks at the bar, they would be on the house.  Of course they were on our bill.... and I was too tired to argue about it.  but overall great food and value.",

    "text": "After watching Top Chef and having already been to Michael Voltaggio's stellar restaurant (The Dining Room), my wife and I had been looking forward to trying Tom Colicchio's \"Craftsteak\" for several months. So, the first thing we did when arriving at Vegas was make reservations.  I'll mention a few things: My wife and I are both under 30 and we were a party of two. I've always felt that if you really want to know how good a restaurant truly is, you visit as a party of two. Any restaurant in the world will bend over backwards to make a big party happy (servers know that more people = bigger tips), but when a restaurant treats a couple well, you know that they have class.   Sad to say, this was the most classless fine dining experience that we've ever had. We would have complained to the manager had they been anywhere to be found... alas, <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a> gets the supreme pleasure of hearing the brutal truth :) Have fun with this guys/gals!  First: for $110 a person, you can eat like a king in Vegas. The food here was edible, but so is the food at any $30 buffet in town. You come to a place like this for top notch service and mind-blowing food - Craftsteak failed at both.  Service: 1/5  As many yelpers have suggested, the service here is almost non-existent until you are filling out the tip line on the check, when it becomes patronizing. We waited nearly 20 minutes before one of our four servers even bothered to ask us if we wanted to get drinks - and another 20 minutes before they asked if we wanted to order. With four servers you'd think that a party of two would be able to place a drink and food order within a half hour.  Now, before you think that this was intentional politeness on their part (nobody likes to be urged to order right away at a nice restaurant), this wasn't that - this was them being nearly oblivious to the fact that we were in the restaurant in the first place; Which is odd, because we made reservations and were seated front and center in the middle of the dining room.   Still optimistic, we asked for an explanation about how the restaurant preferred to serve it's guests - but instead of being offered a clear explanation of the menu, the waiter rambled off a nearly incoherent sentence or two about how we should really just order from the chef's tasting menu. Ok, thanks for nothing - we are at Craftsteak, we KNOW that we're here for the chef's tasting menu! We came to spend!  20 more minutes passed before the next of our waiters arrived. He, again, advised us on the chef's tasting menu. We urged him to explain the tasting menu and finally we got an explanation - which would have been great except that he got his numbers completely mixed up. He explained that each guest receives 2 salad tastings, 2 meat tastings, and 2 side tastings. Our math said that meant 6 different tastings per person - 12 total - another Yelper mentioned 16 plates of food per couple, so that sounded about right.   We waited another 15 before anyone came back to take our order...  The third waiter shows up like the friggin' hero of the day. We proceed to place our order, he informs us that we have everything wrong - you only get 1 of each tasting selection... which is kinda funny - because it defeats the purpose of the \"tasting\" menu if you are just going to serve massive family size portions of a few things, but whatever. We ordered the tasting menus (the wagyu beef versions, which were $130/person).  About 30 seconds pass before we did a little math and realized that we were actually paying quite a bit MORE for the tasting menu than if we had just ordered ala carte for the items that we wanted to try thanks to our fellow Yelpers (Bisque, Quail, Yukon Puree, Filet, etc.).  Throughout the meal, servers rarely came to the table to check on us. Service was tacky, although they were so pretentious that someone might confuse it for them being \"fancy\". Cmon yelpers - it's not \"fancy\" to leave cold, uneaten bread on the table for the ENTIRE meal when you have the main course out. It's not \"fancy\" to leave the clean, empty wine glasses on the table when we are on our second round of cocktails. Fine dining establishments are careful to manicure the eating process, this felt like I was at TGIF Fridays. Servers bumbled around, breaking 2 wine glasses and hoping no one saw. We had dirty, finished plates of food in front of us for the majority of the meal. My drink sat empty for no less than 25 minutes.   I could go on but Yelp limits me to 5000 letters ;)   Food - 2/5: The Ribeye was tasty, but thin and covered in fat and gristle. The Filet was overcooked. The lobster bisque tasted like it was doused in fennel seeds. The quail, onions and yukons were good. The rest was mediocre at best. Again - it was edible, but for $110+ per person, my jaw should be in my lap. Worse, no ever checked on us despite $270 of food being on the table.   Save your cash - or better - use it for a plane to LA and visit The Dining Room. We left disappointed.",

    "text": "Last night, my boyfriend Devin and I went to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at MGM Grand. It's nearly the end of Restaurant Week, and this was our only stop!    We were excited by the menu, and had wanted to try the place for a while, so it seemed like the perfect time. We booked an early dinner, which meant that we got a great booth where we could sit next to each other and share food.  After we sat down, they brought us the most amazing fresh-baked bread. Think King's Hawaiian rolls, but homemade in a cast iron pan and way more buttery. I'm not ashamed to say that we finished the first six rolls and asked for more.   Our drink orders were easy: Two Chimay Reds at $10 apiece. Chimay is pricey anyway, so this wasn't a bad deal, plus this beer goes with absolutely everything! Dev isn't a wine drinker, and I prefer beer as well, plus the wine list was really pricey, so we figured Chimay would serve us well.   The best part was when the waiter came to take our order. There was a choice of four appetizers, three entrees, and three sides, or so I thought. The waiter asked how we would like our steak cooked. Confused, I looked at him and said, \"Oh, I'll have the scallops.\" He said, \"You get everything.\" That's right, for Restaurant Week at Craftsteak, you get four appetizers, three entrees,  three sides, plus two desserts, for $50 a person. Deal. So we said we'd like our steak medium rare.  Our four appetizers came out very quickly. I like quick service. The fennel salad was great; it was raw shaved fennel with a citrusy dressing. It's not for everyone but I love fennel, so I finished the plate. The other salad, a cucumber-arugula affair, was good for me and not good for Dev. I think he had a problem with the flavor of the arugula, and he also dislikes cucumber. I love both, so I liked it. The roasted quail was amazing; even the grapes that were served with it tasted as if they had been fire-roasted. The buffalo mozzarella was also delicious. It was topped with a sort of bell pepper \"tapenade.\" I don't like bell peppers, but these were roasted, and it tasted really great.  I'll move on to the side dishes before the entrees. The side dishes were a sweet corn warm salad, a dish of shiitake mushrooms, and a potato puree. The corn dish was the best corn I've ever had. I'm not even normally a fan of corn, but I had seconds. The mushrooms, well, they were fantastic. I love mushrooms in almost any form, but the flavor of these mushrooms was perfect, just earthy and great. The potato puree was just about as good as the one I had at Robuchon, meaning that it's about half heavy cream and half potato. The chives were a nice touch.  The entrees. Here is where we said medium-rare on the steak. We had both skirt steak and a prime beef flat iron steak. The skirt steak was perfect at a med-rare, but I think looking back I would have ordered the flat iron at a medium, since it was cut thicker. Both steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly. The scallop dish was two sea scallops in a lemon cream sauce with some shaved fennel on top. I  lucked out because Devin only wanted a taste, so I got to eat almost the whole dish. They were cooked perfectly, which you don't always see with restaurant scallops.    The dessert course was more than I expected. The \"Pastry Chef's Selection of Confections, Ice Cream, and Sorbet,\" turned out to be two composed dishes. One was a chocolate panna cotta with a caramel sauce, and the other was a peach concoction, with meringue, whipped cream, fresh peaches, and peach sorbet. I was surprised by how great the peach sorbet was. Not being much of a dessert person (unless it's bread pudding!), I don't usually judge places on their desserts. If desserts were very important to me, these two would have more than passed the test.   The service was impeccable, professional, and efficient. The layout of the restaurant is interesting. I'm glad we were among the first reservations, because we got a great booth in the back. I suspect they give the walk-ins the tables in the front that are open to the rest of the casino, including tacky people walking in from the pool in just their swimsuits.   Overall, I feel that a five star review is warranted, because the food was fantastic, and I'd go there again even if it was a full-price menu. I can't wait to try their filet mignon to see if it compares to Strip Steak's butter-poached version!",

    "text": "If you want a really good steak, this may not be the place for you. After hearing such great reviews on Yelp for CS I was shocked how my food was prepared.   Here is what my girlfriend and I ordered:  2 - Bone in Rib Eye (Medium Rare) 1 - Side of Sweet Corn 1 - Side of French Fries w/ Paprika.   First, our Rib-Eye came out medium well. The server asked my girlfriend and I to slice the steak in half to see if it was overdone (although it shouldn't matter), we did and she said she'll take our steak back. IMO a server especially at a steakhouse should never ask you to cut your steak in half. I'm paying $50! It better be perfect!  As we munch our french fries and sweet corn, the manager came over to let us know another medium rare steak would arrive soon, and they will give us a new order of hot sides to make sure everything goes well together. I wasn't mad nor angry simply because I had faith they would get things right. Again, when the food arrive, it was medium (close to medium rare) once again. At this time, we did not want to send the food back and just decided to eat it anyway instead of waiting for another 30 minutes for them to correct it again.  A steakhouse should know how to prepare a medium rare steak. Although it is the hardest to prepare, a good restaurant should be able to execute this with ease. I'm glad I didnt go \"all-in\" and order the Wagyu ($110) over the rib eye. I would have been pissed if I had to keep sending my Wagyu back.  Bone In Rib Eye 16oz ($50 each) - 3 / 5 Stars  French Fries - 5 / 5 Stars. The fries were insanely good.~$13  Sweet Corn - 5 / 5 Stars. The second batch of corn came out hot and it tasted better than the first one.~$13   Complimentary Bread - 4 / 5 Stars. 6 amazing rolls served hot and warm.  The sides can actually be split between 3 - 4 people. The steak itself was more than enough, I recommend splitting 2 sides between 3-4 people. The sides were good, but it couldn't save CS from a 3 star review. It would be a misleading review if I gave CS a 4 star. If you really want a good steak, I would recommend heading to Delmonico (@ the Venetian). The steak here relied more on some sort of marinating sauce. The Bone-In Rib Eye (18oz) @ Delmonico used a pepper spice and it simply melts in your mouth.  Lastly, CS felt a lot more like a casual restaurant. You see a lot of people ordering steak and eating by the bar. Not ideal if you're looking for a romantic dinner, but it didn't bother me.",

We were originally gonna go to Charlie Palmer steak but  my sister and good friend totally changed my mind and I ended up canceling the reservation the night before and made one for here. It's place is deep in the MGM grand but not hard to find. When we go there, we were sat right away. The hostess was very friendly and asked how we were doing while she took us to the table. We sat down and looked over the menu. One server comes over and greets us and takes our beverage order. he was kind of a younger guy. then another guy comes over (a little older) and takes our food order. I got confused because I wasn't sure who was our server. I guess when the first guy came over, I wasn't listening to him introducing himself and his co-worker that was gonna take care of us. I think that's awesome they partnered up their servers at this restaurant, they can be on top of things. But anyway they bring out dinner rolls. They look like normal dinner rolls with sea salt sprinkled on top. I buttered it up and took a bite, it was a little toasty on the outside and so soft on the inside and oh my that salt goes so well with the roll. I didn't want to eat anymore because I knew I was gonna get full but I did anyway haha. We ordered the Hama Hama oysters and there were a few condiment. It was amazing and so fresh. We wanted to order another half dozen but didn't. We also ordered a Caesar salad, i didn't care too much for it. My scallops were cooked perfect! And my husband's domestic wagyu was like butter and phenomenal! We also got the whipped potatoes (delicious!) and risotto (okay). Souffle was yummy and they also gave my husband a complimentary dessert for his birthday. It was a panna cotta with berries.. That was amazing!! Definitely wanna come back! If you want an wonderful experience, come here!!",

We were split on this one, my wife not wanting to like it because of Tom's on-air personality, secondly because she isn't that big of a beef fan, but was won over very quickly.  Service was exemplary.  The food certainly met and exceeded our expectations.  We were seated promptly for our reservation.  Greeted by the wait staff and presented with a tray of warm Parker house rolls that were perfectly yeasty with a nice fresh topping of sea salt.  We opted for the Wagyu chef's tasting menu with the \"surf\" option added in.  The appetizers were wonderful.  The frisee salad was tossed at the table and was the highlight of the 4 appetizers that came with the dinner.  The main course consisted of cooked to perfection...medium as my wife tends to like her meat a little more cooked than I.  The rib eye was my favorite, the flank steak was her favorite.  The butter poached lobster was de-shelled at the table for a little theatrics and didn't disappoint either.  Finally it came to desserts.  They were all very good.  Its a toss up which we enjoyed more, the chocolate souffle with hazelnut ice cream or the vanilla bean cheese cake, regardless they were all very good.  This was not a cheap meal out but worth every penny for the experience and service we were given.  Certainly would recommend to others and repeat once we run out of celebrity chef's in Las Vegas to visit.",

Hubby had the frisee salad with bacon, blue cheese dressing, and an egg on top.  What a delicious combo.  For entrees, I had the braised short ribs and hubby had the rib eye steak. For our sides we chose the asparagus and the mushroom risotto.  My goodness, there was so much food, we couldn't finish it.  Oh we tried, but just couldn't.  My short ribs was about double the portion you would get anywhere else.  The rib eye was huge.  I'm guessing 16oz?    We hate wasting food, but ultimately we had to throw in the towel.  We didn't have a fridge in our room, and didn't want to carry it on the plane home two days later.    It was a wonderful meal in a beautiful restaurant.  Really friendly and attentive service.  Excellent food.  What more could you ask for?",

After reading the reviews on Yelp, everyone was beyond excited for a great meal.... too bad it was a total disappointment! The service was \"crappy\" to say the least. After putting in our orders, it took an hour and a half for us to be served. My steak came our room temperature and tasted horrible. One member of our party didn't get his meal until 20 minutes after the rest of the table was served. In the past we have eaten at CUT, and maybe this superior experience ruined it for other restaurants. The service there is impeccable, everyone gets their meal at the exact same second! If you want to have a great meal, avoid Craftsteak and go to Cut or Mastro's instead.",

The waiter was very helpful with recommendations. I ordered the new york strip steak and my friend ordered the braised beef both cooked perfectly as ordered. My other friend ordered a hanger steak which ended up being a little rarer than she was comfortable with (although I personally thought it tasted amazing). The waiter even brought us a desert on the house for the bride and a lot of extra bread to eat with our left overs. Be warned, this place is on the pricey side but It was absolutely worth it.",

The bread was delicious to start.  Toasted sweet rolls with a little bit of salt on top was served in a small oven tray.  The salads were very well done as well.  I ordered the pepper salad which was coated in olive oil, with peppers and garlic.  It was presented very nicely and was delicious.  My girlfriend had the Arugula salad and it was equally as delicious.  It was very fresh with a nice subtle lemon dressing.  The steaks were delicious.  I had the fillet mignon and it was very tender and tasty.  My girlfriend ordered the aged New York strip which was amazing as well.  The only complaint I had was my steak came out more on the medium well side when I had requested medium.  Despite this it was still a great steak and did not bother me at all.  I would come back here in a heart beat.  If you are looking for a nice steakhouse in Vegas this is the place!",

    "text": "It was just the two of us, but they seated us next to each other in an oversized booth, facing the dining room.  We half expected a show with our dinner, maybe some jousting or a sword fight ... if nothing else, it made for easy communication with the servers.  I don't usually comment on decor/ambience unless it's bad, but I'm breaking my pseudo-rule to note that Craftsteak impressively accommodates a wide variety of parties, from couples to families with small children to large parties.  Most importantly, the food is good.  The tasting menu, which we settled on after much consideration, is Pure Insanity.  It didn't really dawn on us just what an endeavor it was going to be until we were close to finished with the salads and prawns, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  You start off with three salads of your choice.  Ours: beets, fennel and heirloom tomatoes.  If you love tomatoes, particularly during the height of the season (as it is now), the heirloom tomato salad is a must-try.  Those tomatoes were oh-so-sweet and oh-so-nicely seasoned.  Beets also highly recommended.  Along with the salads, you automatically get grilled prawns.  They were solid, but definitely save room for the steak and sides.  I have one steak recommendation:  the skirt steak.  The higher prices of the ribeye and filet are deceptive.  The less expensive skirt steak is where it's at.  In fact, the slight toughness of the ribeye is the main reason I can't give them 5 stars.  That and their weak mushroom side dish.  Speaking of side dishes, I'll be ordering the potato puree and corn sides again and again.  Then there's dessert.  They brought out three, that's right three, desserts.  Freshly-made donuts, chocolate and vanilla ice cream with fruit accompaniment, and a molten chocolate cake with hand-whipped cream.  We got through no more than half of each dessert, and not without lots of effort.  The donuts were the best, made even better when dipped into the molten chocolate part of the cake.    I wasn't expecting much, but I left over-full, fully satisfied and pleasantly surprised by the whole experience.",

I definitely didn't like the seating area. They sat us at a table between the windows and the bar, so I'm not sure what the rest of the dining area looks like. I guess it's nice if you don't want to sit in a traditional steakhouse? It didn't feel like fine dining, it felt like a bar that happened to serve a good steak.  Come here if you want a good steak and you want to watch some tv. Don't come here if you're expecting some kind of fine dining experience.",

    "text": "We had a reservation. Doesn't seem like it mattered. We had to wait an extra 7 minutes because they didn't have our table together yet. That's what we were told anyhow. There were six of us, we're all heavily tattooed, but were dressed appropriately and very nicely and prepared to spend a lot of money. We were seated in the very back by the kitchen while the couple that walked up before us with no reservation was seated in the same size booth we were, but in the center of the restaurant. Suspect.   Our waiter took our orders and then we waited. And waited. And... Waited. An hour later we were served soups and salads. We were all starving from walking Las Vegas Blvd all day... The lobster bisque was fantastic. The truffle salad (as titled on the menu) was actually just dressed with a truffle vinaigrette. Oh well. It was a great salad, but a touch salty.  Then we continued our wait. Through out the time we ordered until the time our entrees arrived, we were served bread THREE times in effort to stall for the waiting. Yes, the bread was salty, buttery and luxurious, but did we really need six plates of it? We were so hungry we had to eat it.  When our food finally arrived, one and a half hours after ordering, I'm not sure anything short of perfection could have made us happy. I ordered the chicken and smoked paprika tossed French fries. For $36 you get 1/2 of a free range chicken. It was cooked okay, but I make free range chickens at home all the time and they are far more juicy and flavorful. The fries were alright, a bit dry, the smoked paprika was nice.  The steaks, ordered by everyone else at the table were proclaimed to be too salty and a bit too charred though well cooked. I had a bite if and end piece and even it was perfect medium rare. They do cut the steaks into slices before you're served, which I don't prefer, but that is what it is.  Overall, the atmosphere was stuffy and pretentious. We were treated as though we weren't there to spend a pile of money like everyone else was... And the food was \"okay.\" nothing I'd go back for.  We had Witchcraft for lunch and it was fantastic. Should have gone back for dinner and save a couple hundred dollars.",

    "text": "When you are strolling down the steak isle in vegas wondering where to place a bet for the best restaurant for cow you can feel confident that sliding your chips onto the Craftsteak number is sure thing.  I am happy to say that I finally found a place that is up there with the Del Frisco experience.  This is a lot more pricey than Del Frisco's but if you want to branch out from the normal steak in butter and you want more of a  bedazzled experience you have come to the right place.    My friends and I did the Wagyu tasting experience and I highly suggest everyone fork out the money to try it.  We had 3 starters:  Warm Frisee Farm egg, Smoked Bacon dish that was so off the chart I wanted to lick the plate, Hand-cut Wagyu Tartare Crostini that made me so happy I wanted break out some glow sticks and dance in the middle of the restaurant with food ecstasy (which it is vegas and I am sure nobody would have noticed if I did) and the Caesar Salad Pickled Anchovy which was basic and I wish we branched out more.  The dinner included a Lobster Bisque course that was amazing and presented beautifully. Then they rolled out the Wagyu three ways (I believe it was strip, filet, and skirt.  The Filet was by far the best but all of it was fantastic.  The only problem is we couldn't finish it because we were so full from all the courses before it.  After shelling out that kind of money it was sad to not be able to finish it.  Lastly came the desserts and why they thought we could take down 5 desserts among 3 people is beyond my understanding.  Sadly we almost finished them all because they were so good.  The monkey dessert was the best in my opinion.  To wrap up our bedazzled dining experience...I was stuffed, happy and would recommend it to anyone.  Del Frisco's is a lot cheaper but the experience and the different options on courses makes Craftsteak a must do in vegas.  Roll the dice on this one people...this is the one thing you won't regret in the morning.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that I have eaten steak in some of the finest restaurants across the land and I recognize quailty when I taste it. I prefer my steaks rare and believe a steak cooked beyond medium rare is fit for the trashcan and not the beef connoisseur.  Craftsteak was a complete disappointment to me and the rest of my party of six. I ordered their highest grade steak (Wagyu grade 10) and a basic USDA Prime steak to compare the qualities. The \"Wagyu\" was not nearly close to the Wagyu I've had in quailty and marbling and there was no way that it could have been a grade 10. I was substituted a low-quality, lean, pre-sliced, cold piece of steak that the waiter said was \"their best\" when I complained about it. He declined to do anything about it until I truly insisted that he take the steak back and strike it from my bill.   The basic USDA steak was adequate, slightly overcooked, lacked a good exterior searing, more sinewy than should be expected for a $50 steak, but better than their supposed \"wagyu\".  I give this establishment low marks for service, and definitely low marks for the food. If you're serious about steaks, this place is more hype and trendy decor than anything else.  -The Beef Baron",

The warm frisee salad was too sour for me, but the egg and bacon was nice.  The lobster bisque was excellent where it was not as creamy as chowder, but just enough texture to feel like I'm not drinking can soup.  The 6 piece oyster was very fresh and I ate them as fast as they came.    The main course was the wagyu filet mignon and ribeye.  The ribeye was tough for medium rare, but still good.  My favorite was the filet mignon where it was very tender and required very little effort to eat.  The main came with 3 sides which were wild mushrooms, carrots and asparagus.  All cooked very well.    Dessert was coffee ice cream and sencha tea.  The tea helped cleared my palate and was a great close to the meal.  Next time I will have to try the A5 menu.",

This is the 3rd time we have been here & it will not be the last! Fresh ingredients of the highest quality, exemplary service & beautiful surroundings.  We had the seafood platters to start. Succulent shrimp, oysters & crab that was market fresh.  We also ordered the steak tartar (very good)  For my main dish I had the Japanese A5 Wagyu steak. This is not cheap however it is worth every penny of the $260 paid. It is so tender and juicy. This is something everyone should experience once in their lives. I cannot rave enough about it.  The Japanese wagyu is just the best beef money can buy. By far!!!   Do not hesitate to order this even though the price is extreme. Its worth it. Save your pennies and if you order nothing else get this! Then their is the mash potato! It is so silky smooth, creamy & buttery! It is the perfect compliment. You will regret not ordering this!   We also had side of mushrooms, squash , spinach. Asparagus ( very good) & their french fries ( yum)  The desserts are also good. They try to push the monkey bread which is ok but i would opt for the carrot cake instead.  You should visit Craft. You will not be disappointed. Service is also great and they have a brilliant wine and spirits list as well!",

I felt like they were staring at me, judging me for eating their cousin Bessie. *Kanye shrug*   Luckily we were a decent sized group so O got to try a little bit of everything. Thoughts on the food:    * Complimentary bread was good but I thought the top was too salty   * Risotto - omg so good! It was so savory and rich; really, three or 4 bites were filling in itself   * Potato puree - also very rich and flavorful. The consistency was a little strange for me but the flavors were on point so I can't complain   * Mushroom medley - why don't I eat more mushrooms? That's the question I asked myself as I was chowing down on these delish veggies. Perfectly paired with steak.   * Wagyu ribeye - Lord have mercy it was so juicy, tender, flavor, and just so damn amazing! It was a perfect medium rare and every bite was delicious.

    "text": "I was told that Craftsteak was arguably the best steakhouse in Vegas. I don't have the experience to say if it's the best, but it was certainly great. The martini to start was perfect and a solid pour. The service was incredible--I had three waiters for myself alone. I ordered the dry aged ribeye, the asparagus and the potato puree. All were fantastic. There was a sauce on the steak that was unnecessary, but it was light and tasty. And everything was cooked to perfection. I'm not sure it was the best in Vegas, but you will not be disappointed if you eat at Craftsteak.",

From the salads, to the shrimp cocktail, to the ribeye and filet mignon - amazing! We could've done without the mushrooms, but that's okay. The potato puree was delicious, as were the asparagus spears. Dessert was also great, but i am sad I couldn't enjoy the monkey bread as I'm allergic to nuts. That part was a bit disappointing as we had told the wait staff I was allergic beforehand, but oh well. The cheesecake that I was able to eat was divine!!!  There was so much food, we have dinner for tomorrow!  The entire staff was super friendly and treated us like gold. The manager came and checked in with us, too, which we appreciate.  We are very happy that we came here, I am just sorry I didn't catch anyone's name!  From the hostess to the server team, to the people refilling our water - everyone was great. We also believe his place has set the bar for steaks. :)",

The fiancee wanted to make it a special weekend since we were recently engaged and it was our anniversary. So we made reservations and were seating in a timely fashion. We had the nice private booth in the corner.   We opted for the Domestic Wagyu Surf & Turf. At $160 per person, we felt it was totally worth it for all the food we had. We let our waiter know that we're trying to limit the carbs (the delicious bread was enough) and have more of the veggie options. They did an awesome job of accommodating us.   First course: Lobster Bisque - I wanted a huge bowl of this. Tartare - WONDERFUL.  Pinkerton Avocado - I liked it, but my not so avocado liking dinner companion did not. Heirloom Tomatoes - Okay. I wouldn't of ordered this on my own.  Second course: Diver Sea Scallops - Melt in your mouth awesome. Ribeye - nom Skirt - even nommers Brentwood Sweet Corn - best side ever! Mushroom Assortment - I heart mushrooms, but this did not wow me. Green Beans - snooze. I can make this at home.  Third course: Cheesecake - mmm vanilla... Monkey Bread - super sweet, but delish! Sorbet - an after thought..  We really enjoyed our meal here and look forward to coming back again. :D",

It's a good thing we're honest because it was a lot less than our actual check was.   They brought us the right one and we paid and left.

Their bread rolls were amazing but you can't eat more than 2 or you'll get full fast. Lobster bisque was creamy and above average of lobster chunks. Beats tasted clean and pure; no dirt aftertaste. Risotto tasted more like macncheese   CON: Spent $400 for their 3 course meal.  (4) thinly cut pieces of Prosciutto with a breadstick. The Risotto tasted more like macncheese. Their Wagu beef  (only 50%)  consisted of strip and ribeye. Cooked to perfection but could barely taste the sauce. We were so full by the time the main entree arrived that we could not finish the medium sized steaks.   I've had better steaks and paid significantly less. I was expecting much much more from this restaurant but in the end it seemed like an old school steak joint rather than modern.",

I don't know if I am prejudiced against you because you are top chef king and I just expect so much out of your food. I told my daughter I wish I could serve you your recipe and one similar and see if you could tell the difference and if you even would like yours better.  I visited your heritage steak house and did not like it. I liked craftsteak a lot more than heritage but still wasn't wowed   I started off with the Caesars salad because it is my favorite. Your version was ok. Dressing wasn't great and those big whole anchovies grossed me out.  For my entree had the beef short ribs. They were very good. I also ordered risotto instead of potatoes and wished I hadn't. Risotto was supposed to have pancetta which I thought would give it nice salty flavor but I didn't taste that at all and it was so al dente to the point of almost crunchy that I just didn't like it.  For dessert I had the monkey bread which I thought I would love but I hated the brown sugar ice cream it came with because  of a weird aftertaste and thought there were way too many raw pecans on the dessert.  Service was great.",

My husband and I arrived without a reservation but were told there was indeed an open table since it was a Tues. which is usually a \"little slower\" as per hostess. So, we waited....and waited...and waited. An older couple came in after us, also without reservations & they were seated literally within 10 min. My husband asked the hostess why that happened being that we arrived a good 15 min prior to this couple. We were asked if we asked for a \"specific\" table and perhaps that's why we were still waiting. HUH?? We informed them it's was our first time therefore we had no table preference. We just wanted to have a nice sit down dinner, celebrate our (belated) anniversary, which we couldn't celebrate when it happened because I was in the hospital at the time, unfortunately. We moved to the area recently but we had so looked forward to experiencing some of the culinary staples in Vegas. Top Chef has been one of our fave competitions to watch for years. So, imagine our disappointment when we were finally told, after 45 min. that there weren't ANY tables readily available after all. We could however be placed on a \"cancellation/no show\" list, so IF anyone cancelled we would get a call, as a \"courtesy\" mind you. Needless to say we ended up \"packing our knives and going\"...to the nearest fast food place before I passed out from low sugar.",

Fingerling potatoes were undercooked but nothing special butter and salt. Nick, got the short ribs which I thought was better but I've eaten way better short ribs and steak in other places being Vegas you would think they could do a better job. The sides are huge so i believe you could share it with someone. I think the puree potatoes where the best part of the meal but I've made potatoes like these at home so again nothing special. The dessert was another so so. Overall I wouldn't pay good money to eat here there are to many places to choice from in Vegas! Granted they were nice and service is good but I'm not here for that as much as the food!! the waiter overheard us say it's heathers birthday which was nice that they brought some cookies out but I have to agree with another yelper it taste like cookies from box. Lol, at least get some real baked cookies. The ones from the frozen section were better than these. Granted someone come out to the table and said how was our food. I didn't want to say anything because it would have been all negative. Lol, if a steak house can't make a steak better than I could then it becomes so so in my books. Great service but for the price and taste I won't come here but since it's my first time I only can judge from my experience and I did try everyone's else stuff so so there too.",

We were debating between Tom's and Ramsey's restaurant at Paris, and ultimately chose this one.. I'm thinking we made a mistake.  It was a special night and we ordered the tartare as an appetizer which was sooo salty and then as for the steak, i think i got the flat iron and the bf got some sort of filet, very unmemorable for a steak. And we got the risotto as a side to share. The steaks were supposed to be medium rare, but mine was overcooked. The risotto was my favorite part of dinner.  Then, this lady came around and asked if she can take a picture, we said sure.. but it turned out to be a 10 minute photoshoot full with posing and everything. It was soo awkward. I dont even know if she was part of the restaurant. Definitely unprofessional and unnecessary. At the end of our expensive dinner, the lady came back with all our pictures and pressured us into buying them all for $130! WTHeck...?! I was not happy about that. We ended up spending over $200 for dinner and paid $50 for one of the pictures that we liked.   I dont think I will ever come back here again.",

But, I returned recently and the experience was so good that I came back for a third visit a couple weeks later. On my two most recent visits I dined in their lounge where the service was impeccable, the atmosphere was relaxed, and the food flawless.  If you go to Craftsteak splurge for their domestic wagyu at the very least (they also have Australian Wagyu and recently received real wagyu from Japan). The wagyu skirt steak (14 oz) will give you a new appreciation for that cut of beef. It's so tender that you can cut it with a butter knife. It has the tenderness of a filet with the flavor of a rib eye.  Other items that shouldn't be missed include their sweet corn, potato puree, and roasted baby beets. The sea scallops and 24 hour short rib are also amazing. The real showstopper (besides the skirt steak) is the cinnamon monkey bread. I've heard others rave about it and now I know why. It's like the most delicious bread pudding you can have that has been topped with a sinfully sweet pecan toffee accompanied by brown sugar sour cream ice cream.  After two amazing meals this place is back up there with my other favorite steakhouses. Yeah, it's pricey, but it's in line with pricing at similar spots around town.",

What a treat, with 2 domestic wagyu steaks & 1 Double R grade steak which included - starter, salad, sides, & 5 different dessert offerings. We had 5.30p seating and restaurant wasn't too busy but as the night progressed with larger parties it was quite loud, which is better with kids. Overall we had a nice time with great food & very attentive service. There was southern couple that were seated across from us, the wife & I were on high alert in case the kids started to fuss but it worked out, the kids got a bit antsy but overall behaved for the meal. After they were done & headed to their show, the nice couple complimented on the kids behavior. So as parents, we were all smiles. Thank you. So for all the parents who would like to enjoy some fine dining in Vegas with the kids, you can do it!!!!!!",

    "text": "This is a definite must if you are in Vegas and you want great steak. It is located in the MGM resort. The service is perfect. Our server was very attentive. The entire team would make sure we are never running out of water. Every once in a while they just walk by to create conversation. The restaurant wasn't loud but at the same time it wasn't completely quiet. I felt very relaxed and comfortable when I got in. We had to wait approximately an extra 10 minutes even though we had reservation but that was okay as we were able to sit at the bar and order drinks. The drinks themselves were normal and nothing spectacular. My fiancee and I ordered a long island ice tea and a glass of wine for the meal. Now on to the main things about restaurant and that is food. You can order a la carte or if there more than 2 people you can order a special combo for a slightly cheaper price. We went a la carte as we felt there would be too much food. For the appetizer, we ordered their wagyu tartare and it was good not great. The onions were slightly too overpowering. The wagyu was done well though. The main dishes were an amazing ribeye and their cheapest meat, the hangar. First, the ribeye is absolutely amazing. I really like the fact that they cut it into smaller slices since they knew we were sharing. It was a fattening perfection, perfectly cooked medium rare ribeye. I really can't describe it more than that. Now the cheapest cut, the hangar might sound like it will be a decent item but you will regret thinking that after you take in the first bite. This is my favorite item here. I won't bother describing it as I believe everyone who goes here will learn to not judge a book by its cover. We also ordered side dishes and the shitake mushroom was amazing. The second side dish we ordered was probably the worse of all the items we order and that is the asparagus. We wanted something that would counterbalance the steak and shitake mushroom so we order it hoping the lemon zest asparagus would fulfill it. Unfortunately, the asparagus wasn't sour enough. Needless to say it was still a decent side dish but disappointing when compared to all the other items. This is now the second time we have been here and of all the steakhouses we have been to in Vegas this will always be in our stomach's desire. This is a must for all steak lovers who wants amazing services as well. There will be no regrets.",

Especially the caesar salad and the fresh baked bread for the table.  We all did the 3 course domestic wagyu meal which is a great way to sample all the cuts, sides and desserts.  The NY cut was delicious.  The filet melted in your mouth.  The wagyu ribeye lacked that fatty buttery flavor which you come to expect from a ribeye.  Was not really impressed with the \"wagyu\" and suspect the regular cuts may be a better bang for the buck.    For sides, the potato puree and the bacon brussel sprouts were heavenly.  The dessert assortment was also stellar.  The chocolate souffle and bananas foster were both a treat.",

I did the summer special 3 course meal. Lobster bisque, Cesar salad, New York steak, puree mashed potatoes, sweet corn, and for the finisher their chocolate peanut butter cake. Every entree was exceptional! Our waiter mentioned that the corn was harvested that very day. The ny steak was tender, juicy, and full of flavor! You could almost cut it with a fork. I knew once I tried the buttered bread rolls that they bring you to start with,  I was in for one exceptional meal. I will definitely be back!",

The rolls were hot and the butter just the perfect temperature. I loved the touch of salt on the top of the rolls. We decided on the tasting menu which allowed us to choose a few starters, two meats, and desserts. We had the lobster bisque to start (so good). It had just the right amount of chunks of lobster. Then we had two salads - Caesar with white anchovies and arugula salad with an awesome dressing. Both were so satisfying. For the 2nd course we chose the rib eye and filet mignon. The meat was so soft and tender melting in your mouth like butter. Just thinking about it again makes me so happy. For sides we had the brussels sprouts and potatoes au gratin which were also awesome. By the time dessert came out we were stuffed but we couldn't resist. Even dessert was a feast. We were served the monkey bread with banana ice cream, as well as, sorbet and coffee ice cream. The chocolate cake was rich and decadent. We were also served an assortment of sliced fruit. Again, the meal was perfection!",

    "text": "It took me a while to write this review because I really didn't know what to say.  This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in some time.    First, the good: -the bread (free) is pretty cute, it comes out on it's own little pan/tray, stuck together like King's hawaiian rolls.  The okay: -Green beans were average, some sliced almonds were added for crunch. -Spinach was average, cooked in garlic oil. -Warm frise salad, the bacon was good, the huge globs of uncooked egg were a bit strange though.  I enjoyed it overall because it was different from the usual type of salad.  The bad: -Steak was well done, and we asked for medium rare.     -Service, there was consistently a group of waiters standing about 10 feet from us, but no one ever came by to check on us.  About 25 minutes after our steak came to our table, a woman, not our main server, came by and asked how our food was.  We explained that it was overcooked and she said, \"oh.\"  She didn't offer to take it back and replace it, she didn't offer a discount or a freebie, she didn't offer a sorry.    I just don't think that a steak restaurant can offer bad steak.  Maybe because it's Vegas they just depend on one-time customers and not repeat business; I can say with confidence that I won't be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Located in the MGM Grand, Craftsteak's decor is reminiscent of a cozy, sophisticated cigar lounge. Committed to making the most of this experience, my friend and I boldly opted for the Domestic Waygu 3-course meal for two from the Chef's Beef Selection tasting menu, but we had no idea what we were in for :-O  Although completely open to deferring to the Chef's choice, we were slightly hesitant about not having the opportunity to taste some of the menu items that spoke to us upon first glance. Our server immediately put us at ease by asking about our likes and dislikes....thus the adventure began! Our meal started with the signature house dinner rolls. Light and fluffy with the familiar comfort that can only come from yeast, these rolls were served piping hot and lightly dusted with coarse sea salt.  Next were our appetizers:the lobster bisque was rich, creamy and meaty -  everything you want in this decadent soup. A perfectly fresh wild arugula salad with cucumbers and red onions in a refreshing lime vinaigrette. Prosciutto served with fig marmalade...need I say more? Buffalo mozzarella topped with roasted hazelnuts and roasted red pepper caponata...ummmm cheese, hello! Honestly we probably could have stopped here and been content but alas that was not the case.....bring on the beef!   Our waygu beef entrees and their accompanying sides as chosen by the Chef were: the 14 oz. grilled skirt steak in a delicious bordelaise (red wine reduction and veal stock) sauce with cipollini onions was super tender and naturally flavorful. The 10 oz. roasted filet mignon was truly \"melt in your mouth\" perfection. The  baby spinach in garlic oil, mushroom assortment (Shimeji white beach, morel, french horn and hen of the woods) and creamy grits with bacon and gruyere cheese left us stuffed beyond words. Yet there was one more course awaiting us.  For dessert, we were served: plum and raspberry sorbet, an assorted fruit tray, peanut butter mousse covered in chocolate with salted caramel peanut brittle and cinnamon ice cream on a bed of chopped peanuts (which my friend loved) and my absolute fav of the four: cinnamon brioche monkey bread with chopped walnuts, caramel sauce and brown sugar sour cream ice cream. Yumtastic is a understatement!  After such an incredible meal, we still had plenty of leftovers. We were so stuffed and delirious with ecstasy that we decided to share our meal with a homeless gentlemen on our way back to the hotel.  The only (and I mean only) thing that would've made this meal better would have been if Mr. Colicchio himself had served us. If there was ever an OMD! moment, it was around 10:30pm PST on October 1, 2012 at Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak Restaurant in Las Vegas, Nevada -  for we agree that this moment will go down as the best meal of these two Foodies' lives!",

I had a seat at the bar after a bit of a wait to find an open spot ( on a Friday night just before the AC/DC concert - so it's to be expected ).  Alexis and Larry are both absolute gems - very friendly and welcoming.  I started with the Prosciutto appetizer which was very nice and simple - shaved Prosciutto stretched flat on the plate with a few pieces of marinated Figs in the bottom left corner and a house made Grissini laid across the top.  Very simple, clean, and flavorful.  For dinner I went with the 18 oz. bone-in Ribeye this time ( I'm usually a Filet guy but I just had one of those a few nights prior so I decided to step a bit outside my box ) and am I ever glad I did.  As is all of their steaks, it was cooked just right to a nice medium rare+ and served in an all-clad copper pan with juices and a roasted Shallot.  The steak was super flavorful and marbled just right.  For sides I had smaller portions each of the Red Pepper Risotto and roasted Carrots - both were outstanding.  The Risotto was properly al dente with just the right about of Red Pepper flavor with a few strips of the pepper mixed in and a light dusting of Parmesan over top.  The Carrots were beautifully roasted with a dressing of Honey and a hint of Rosemary.  Divine.  Alexis made a really nice suggestion for a glass of wine to pair with my steak and after that all was right in the world.  This place NEVER disappoints and I always suggest it when asked where to eat in Las Vegas.  Thanks for always being consistent and doing an outstanding job - I can't wait to return!",

Apparently beer/cider list rotates daily, there were 10-12 selections listed with 2 beers on tap.   Food:   Mozzarella appetizer: 1 star out of 5. It felt like someone went to Safeway, grabbed a pack of mozzarella off the shelf, dumped it onto a plate and sprinkled some stuff on it. The only right thing about this dish were the hazelnuts.   Frisee salad: 3.5 out of 5. Massive portion large enough for 3 people. That might be a good thing in some non-hind quarters but my preference is for quality over quantity. The egg, bacon and ensuing table-side cement-like mixing of them with the salad would have been excellent on its own. Alas, the warm, innocent salad was rudely interrupted by the presence of asteroid-sized chunks of blue cheese. Disclaimer: I love cheese of all varieties, blue in particular. If I am mummified in blue cheese after my death, that would be swell and par for the course. (Tutankhamun - eat your heart out)  Steak - we tried filet mignon and NY strip, both made from US wagyu beef. NY strip was perfect, 5 stars. One of the better NY strips I've had. The filet mignon is where this meal went downhill faster than a wagon full of cheap Gordon Ramsay insults. Weighing in at 8 oz and $120, the filet mignon should have been a masterpiece. Instead it was a tough, chewy, unevenly cooked piece of rubber-like substance that you couldn't cut through with my neighbor Rick's antique saw, forget doing it with a butter knife. The bordelaise reduction didn't help, herbed butter would have been a better choice.  Did not attempt dessert.",

The wagyu was very tender but we thought it should be more fatty and marbled... which it probably was and made it all so tender. But the fat content when you bite into it wasn't very apparent. I enjoy the fat on my steaks so....  Damage: G.T. $450 (incld a half bottle of wine ($90))  Worth trying.... at least once...",

The first time I was with some lifelong girlfriends on a few days away, and our waiter (his name escapes me now) treated us like gold and made the night most memorable.  He tossed in free drinks, and apps and gave us just enough attention without bothering us.  The food was beyond fantastic and we still talk about the evening.  The second time I was with a large group and again the service was impeccable and the food wonderful.    I find most Vegas versions of \"famous chefs\" restaurants disappointing, but Craftsteak lives up to all the hype.",

    "text": "Our expectation were probably too high.  I assumed an establishment owed by someone who spends their life criticizing others imperfections, could really wow me.  I have been to steakhouses all over the Country.  I seek them out on business and personal travel because I love the service, wine and food quality great steakhouses have to offer.  I never mind paying a lot as long as everything is on point.  I really expected to be blown away.  I opted not to get the $260.00 8oz Japan filet.  Really?  Comon'.  Everything was ridiculously overpriced even for a fine steakhouse, but that's to be expected in this town and inside the MGM.  The steak and the sides were just ok.  For a high-end steakhouse, there menu items and options are extensive.  Our sides were a little salty and the steak slightly overcooked & my dirty martini was too dirty.  The Manhattans were good, but not as good as mine of course.  As with most good restaurants in Vegas, the wine list was very good.  We sat at the bar and the service was average.  Not overly attentive but adequate.  All in all, I have had better experiences at the Capital Grille / Del Frisco's and spent less.  I cant help but think that if he didn't have a show on cable and being located in the MGM, it probably wouldn't do that great.",

    "text": "One of the best meals I've had for a weekend of xs (the whole city is excessively fun...). Service was exquisite and so was the food.  The sommelier introduced himself, who was very helpful in our wine selection. We had a 2004 Chateauneuf du Pape, which was an outstanding choice and would highly recommend ($90).  The butter rolls arrived, and like all the other yelpers have raved, it was so good. They come in a batch of six, and by the time we had finished 4, another set had come. Great service.  Apps - We had the Seafood Platter and Kobe Beef Tartare. The seafood platter was delicious, comprised of oysters, clams, prawn, lobster, seaweed salad, alaskan king crab, and caviar. One person in the party said the only problem with this platter \"was that it wasn't bigger.\" This seafood app blows Mastro's out of the water (seafood lives in water....). The beef tartare was equally amazing, which was raw kobe beef with a raw egg on top, served with miniature bread pieces. The tartare prepared us well for the main course ahead.  The Main Course - 16oz. Grilled RIbeye steak, charred rare. The steak was perfectly marbled, with a high fat content, which ribeyes should have. Cooked perfectly. I also got to sample my friends' grilled NY Strip and Wagyu Ribeye. All were delectable, and was able to distinguish the varying textures of the cuts.  Sides - Bean Sprouts, Hen of the Woods Mushrooms, and Yukon Gold Puree. Bean Sprouts were interesting in a good way. Paired with bacon, the sprouts were well prepared with a great texture. The Hen of the Woods (I'm told this is a Colicchio signature dish) were interesting as well. It didn't blow everything out of the water, but it was very good, with a good texture. I love mushrooms, and this was like nothing I've ever had before. The Yukon Gold Puree was a very buttery bowl of mashed potatoes, prepared thinner than regular mashed potatoes. It was awesome.  Didn't get to dessert because 1) I don't like dessert (I'd rather have more steak) and 2) was very full.  Went for halloween weekend, but the candy wasn't just for trick or treaters. There was plenty of eye candy as well ;) It was funny seeing a  cow walk into a steakhouse.",

Sides, apps and salads run around $15 - $25 and the wine list is awesome and pricey. The bar is fantastic and their selection of brown booze is second to no one. If you are looking for a good steak in Vegas this is a nice stop as all of the steak places are about the same price. Plan on paying $100++ per person.",

    "text": "4.5 STARS  Being a Top Chef fan, my bf and I were very excited to go to one of Tom Colicchio's restaurants. Being the hard ass that he is on the show, your food better be darn good to place your name on a restaurant. Craftsteak lived up to ALL my expectations and that shouldn't be taken lightly (I'm a very critical person that's very hard to please...)  On 12/6, being that it was the night of the De La Hoya and Pacquiao fight, it was PACKED. Luckily, we had reservations for 5:30 PM and were seated promptly.   I loved the super swanky decor --high ceilings with hanging lights, and huge decantors lined up on one side of the room which gave the room a dramatic effect. Not sure if because it was the week of the National Rodeo event, but they were playing country music which did not jive with the decor and was very off-putting.   On to the food...  My bf and I both ordered the Domestic Waygu 3-Course Tasting Menu ($130/person). Before our 1st course, we were given bread which tasted and resembled Pan De Sal. It was nicely toasted on the outside. Upon tearing it in half, the inside was light and fluffy.    First Courses: *Diver Scallops: Very good, it was nicely crusted and tender. The creamy white sauce with a hint of rosemary was a perfect compliment.  *Kobe Tartare:  Very good, the quail (?) egg yolk added an extra later of richness to the already buttery texture of the tartare. That combined with the warm, crispy crostini was a good combination of textures. *Caesar Salad: Excellent, the best Caesar I've ever tasted. The dressing had the perfect amount of seasoning and kick. It had an intense depth of flavor to it without being too salty. *Roasted Red Peppers: Eh, I'm not a fan of bell peppers in general, so I didn't care too much for this.  Main Courses: *Kobe Skirt Steak: OMFG--MIND BLOWING!!!! Words can't describe how AMAZING this tasted. I'm not a fan of skirt steak; I normally go for the Filet Mignon or NY Strip. But, after tasting this cut, it has changed my mind forever about this cut.   It was cooked PERFECTLY; it was nicely charred and cooked to an exact medium rare. It was served on a caste iron plate surrounded by its juices. It was nice and crisp on the outside and SUPER TENDER and moist in the inside. It had SO MUCH FLAVOR (w/o being overly salty)--it was like an INTENSE EXPLOSION in my mouth.   The first time I had Kobe was from Lark Creek Steak where I was quite disappointed. But, Craftsteak's Kobe tasted nothing like this. No doubt about it, the ABSOLUTE BEST STEAK EVER!!!! If I had one last meal on Earth, this would be it! *Kobe Strip: It was just ok...it wasn't tender and didn't have much flavor--disappointing.   *Sides: -Mashed Potatoes: The BEST mashed potatoes I've ever tasted. It was whipped perfectly. It was super creamy and buttery; just way mashed potatoes is suppose to be. Again, it was very flavorful without being too salty (I'm very sensitive to salt). -Asparagus: It was nice and tender. It was topped off with crispy lemon zests which gave the dish a great texture combination. -Shitake and Chanterelle Mushrooms: Eh, could have passed on this one.  Third Course: *Molten Chocolate Lava Cake Crusted with Macadamia Nut and Espresso Ice Cream: Very good; at this point, I was stuffed and spilling out of my dress, so I was only able to enjoy one bite. Upon cutting the cake, which was nice, and crisp, rich decadent chocolate oozes out. That paired with the rich ice cream led to a great combination of flavors, heat (hot/cold), and textures.   *Spiced Apple Cake with Maple Ice Cream: OMG GOOD! The cake was crisp outside and moist and light inside. It paired perfectly with the maple ice cream. Again, great texture and flavors. The ice cream had pieces of maple candy in it which took it to another level. *Pineapple and Grapefruit Sorbet with Fresh Fruit: I ate most of this dessert, as it was light and refreshing. It was a great ending to the meal.   Service was impeccable and not pretentious.   BTW, the portions are MASSIVE. The two 3 course menus we ordered could have easily fed 4 people. I liked the fact that they mixed up our menu since we both got the same tasting menu. This way we didn't end up with two of everything.   If it weren't for the Kobe Strip which was disappointing, Craftsteak would have gotten 5 stars in my book.  The bill came to about $400 including 2 glasses of wine which was definitely worth it for the quantity and quality of food you receive.   All in all, we had a wonderful experience here from start to finish, and will ABOSULTELY be back here the next time we come to Vegas. Now I only wish Tom would open a location in SF...",

I didn't, however, find it to be as good as I had anticipated. We both got steaks ( NY strip and a filet) and shared Brussels and pureed potatoes as sides. In truth, there was a little too much oil on the sprouts for my liking and the steak was good but again, not what I had anticipated from this restaurant.  The hard part is that we spent +$400 for the meal and one bottle of wine and left satisfied, not raving about the meal. Let's not forget that everything in Vegas is ridiculously overpriced now so had the meal been more moderately priced we might have a better review.",

I got the sirloin and it was dry and just ok. For these prices I expect to be whisked away on some kind of steak adventure.  Some of the positives were the service, the side dishes and the unique ambiance. Lot's of cool shades of red and oaky textures for the general layout.

    "text": "made reservations for 5:15pm (the earliest they could seat you) because we had to catch a 7:30pm show in new york new york.   They seated us right away and we were given a menu. We ordered the prosciutto ($14) for appetizer, which was basically a ginormous plate full of proscuitto slices. For some reason I thought it was going to be served with something else, not just plain prosciutto. However, it was the best tasting prosciutto I had in my life, recalling back to the taste of fresh ham from my childhood in Bolivia, though thinner and chewier, and possibly fresher.   entree: I ordered the bison ($39), and my bf ordered the kobe flat iron steak ($58, if i remember correctly). The bison was tastier than beef. I chose it because I read it on yelp somewhere that bison is just really good. I thought I'd try it at Tom's restaurant so I could blame him if it sucked. It didn't. It was juicy, tender, lean, and it had a kick to it. My bf's kobe was a hit. He said that it doesn't hit you (how good it is) until you're about to swallow. I'd say the taste and texture of kobe definitely develops as you chew it. Perhaps next time, we can try the wagyu (still have yet to try it).  For sides, we got the yukon mashed potatoes ($11), and the asparagus ($11). Next time, I'd just get the mashed potatoes and save myself an extra $11. The asparagus was great, too, but it wasn't to die for like the prosciutto or the mashed potatoes (which also tasted like my childhood mashed potatoes that were made with fresh cow milk and loads of butter).  Our server asked us what kind of wine, if any, we would like to pair with our steak. I asked him what went well with bison, since I never had it before. Good wine pairing suggestions as well.  The total bill was $204, tax & tip included.  the experience? priceless. I'd say this is one of the best steak houses we've gone to so far.   We told our server that we had a show to catch and we were out by 6:45pm. However, the wait time for our food was about 45 minutes. We're not the most patient people but I think this is somehow normal in vegas.  I'd totally go back, and with more money next time.",

    "text": "Very delicious meal. My major regret though is ordering the tasting over the a la carte. We did the $145 domestic wagyu \"tasting\". My issue was that for 2 people, it was more of an apps, sides, and desserts tasting over a steak tasting. The amount of apps, sides, and desserts was absurd and kinda took away from the steak experience for me (and it looks like the tasting portion of steak is smaller than the a la carte portion). I struggled hard to finish my steak and left so full I couldn't see straight. Might be better for a larger group.  Nonetheless, I tried various delicious things and here's my recap: - rolls- salty and fresh! Leftovers were great the next day too :) -Lobster bisque- big ass chunks of lobster and lots of good flavor, a little too rich to precede a steak dinner though in my opinion. -Persian cucumber salad- light, refreshing, crisp -Frisee- with the runny egg and Gorgonzola it gets a nice creamy texture. Lardons on point. - wagyu tartare- not the best I ever had but still enjoyable - wagyu skirt steak- one on the most memorable steaks I ever had! Got it medium rare and loved every second of it - wagyu rib eye- found this to be a let down, it was tough and would have preferred the angus over the Kobe if I did it again.  - Yukon mashed potatoes- best I ever had - mushroom medley- loved it - broccoli rabe- I usually hate it, but it's well salted and garlicky so, done very well! - mango cheesecake- my dessert fave! - sticky pecan bun- very tasty but too big and decadent for my taste. I had 2 nice bites. If I finished the whole thing I would have exploded. Good for sharing. - fruit- whatever it's fruit. Good but had it not come with the tasting I wouldn't order - sorbet- good and light  So as you can see, loads of food and you def get your money's worth. The skirt steak wagyu was the winner with potatoes taking the silver. If I could do it again, I would order one of the above salads, skirt steak wagyu, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and mango cheesecake or the sticky bun :)  Service was perfect and the steak knives were weird.",

Although we were suppose to get the quail, they had run out and replaced it with prosciutto (reason for 4 stars because it was mighty salty and not equivalent to eating quail). We had the grilled kobe beef sirloin which was delicious. The diver sea scallops were tender and moist. The dessert was melt in your mouth good.",

The hostess never checked in with us and we had to repeatedly double check on whether our table was ready or not. There is hardly a waiting area and the servers running between tables were very rude and acted put out when asking us to move out of their way. There is literally nowhere comfortable to stand.  The food is uninventive and uninspired. There were 6 of us and we ordered lobster bisque, which was good but served lukewarm, oysters, that were not shucked properly, and a Caesar salad, which was nothing special.  We all had steak, which for the price was not worth it, not cooked correctly, and strangely seasoned. As for the sides,Tom Colicchio, as a Top Chef judge, should really be ashamed. The best part of the meal were the Parker House Rolls and the wine.   The best part of the dinner was the service, which was very good.   My recommendation is to go somewhere else, especially if you have a large party, and especially if you're willing to drop a lot of money for food that should fit the price.",

After I was informed that I was early for my reservation(which I was not), the girl that I made the reservation with proceeded to tell me that it was my fault the reservation was mixed up, she did not offer an apology. Even if it is the customers fault, you should try to have good customer service. Had the shrimp cocktail as a starter, the shrimp were good, but they only served 5 so there was a rush for the last one. At $24 for the shrimp, I should have taken others advise and got the bisque. For main course had lobster and steak, and a 10oz fillet for the wife. My steak was a little bland, however my wife's steak was perfectly seasoned. Over all it was a decent meal, but not one that I must have again",

It was helpful without being overbearing.  My husband ordered the grilled ribeye, and it was great.  A bit undercooked, but the flavor was awesome.  I ordered a small portion of the scallops, and they were flavorful.  The creamed potatoes and balsamic onions were very tasty without being too rich.  I have to give credit to all the Yelpers because the BEST part of the meal was the monkey bread dessert with banana ice cream.  We usually don't get dessert, but I am still dreaming of it!",

    "text": "More 41/2 than 4. Wanted to try this place because I read good things about it on yelp. Overall an excellent dining experience the reason for the 4 stars is because I was disappointed with my steak otherwise every other facet of the meal was outstanding.I enjoyed the atmosphere but I'm always a little disappointed when a restaurant of this caliber feels the need to have TVs anywhere near the establishment. I started out with the Wagyu tartare which was tasty and contrasted well with the crostini I highly recommend this as a starter. Like I said before I wasn't  thrilled with my steak and I believe the cut had a lot to do with that.I ordered medium but it came out medium well and a little chewy,that was suprising considering steaks are what they specialize in.At Ruth's Chris the waiter/waitress have you cut the steak to make sure it's cooked to your liking, no such luck here.  The sides of risotto and baby spinach were great and enough to serve two people. The cocktails were made well and I recommend the cucumber martini. Next time I'll be having the Wagyu tasting menu.The meal came out to about $360 including tip but that's because of the seven drinks between me and my bud.  That's about average for most high end steakhouses that I have been too.",

    "text": "I have to say that my expectations for Crafteak were very high after reading the yelp reviews and the menu. We ordered the summer tasting menu, which I probably won't do next time because I really wanted to try the short ribs. First off, the ambiance and the service is excellent. For starters we had buffalo mozzarella, quail, fennel salad and a persian cucumber salad. Everything was great except for the cucumber salad which was way too salty (we couldn't even eat it).  For the main we had the diver scallops, skirt steak, and the flatiron steak. I ate both scallops since BF doesn't like them - the first one was okay..but the second was gritty. Now, I should have sent it back I know..but I am always reluctant to do so.  So, that was a big disappointment..it ruined the flavor. The steak was very good, a lot of thyme in both marinades.  The skirt steak is a chewier cut of meat and I would never order it a la carte.  The sides were amazing!!!!!!!  The corn was so good and so was were the mushrooms and yukon gold mash. A vegetarian would be in heaven here. Seriously...I am a serious carnivore..but the corn was the best thing on the menu.   The dessert was some of the best I have ever had - blueberry cheese cake and chocolate lava cake with fresh mint ice cream. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. My BF is a cheesecake fanatic and said it was the absolute best he had every had.   Basically, Craftsteak loses one star for the gritty scallop and lackluster-oversalted starters. I would definitely go back since some of the dishes were absolutely amazing as well as the service and ambiance.",

    "text": "The food was average. There wasn't anything special that set them apart from other steak houses. I ordered the braised lobster while my friend ordered the rib eye. We shared so we can both have a surf n turf kind of meal. The steak was ok. I felt it need a little more seasoning. The lobster was overcooked. It was a chewy mess. My mom got the rack of lamb. She hardly had anything on her plate after she trimmed off the fat. The sides were horribly bland. We got the spinach and asparagus. I loved the sides at Brand in Monte Carlo. I was thoroughly disappointed with the sides here. Anyone can throw a high grade piece of meat on the grill and make it taste good but a good chef can make something boring like spinach taste spectacular. I was expecting somewhere between good and spectacular for $$$$. I would give this place 3 stars but the service sucked. This older black guy waited on us and he neglected us the whole night. He never once refilled my coke. Not once in the 2 hours we were there. He also dropped off dessert menus on our table and didn't return for another 30 mins to take our order. Unfortunately by then we were just over it. I'm pretty understanding when a place is super busy or short staffed but it was neither. I would not recommend this place to anyone esp since there are so many good places to eat in Vegas.",

They serve everything with panache, but the basic of a proper steak house - serving really good steak, just wasn't there. When I order a $50 steak, I expect it to be prime, a standard the steak I was served at this place didn't even come close to. As I hacked my way through the leathery chunk of meat that I was served I wondered how long it had been since I had had such a lousy piece of meat. I remembered meat that was a couple of grades lower that was more juicy and tender, even low end supermarket steaks tasted better and cut easier than this. Even the nice steak knife they gave me didn't slice easily through the cartilaginous mess that they served me, except with difficulty. What was worse, while they had cooked the steak to perfection they obviously had let it sit on a counter somewhere as it arrived cold to my plate. The scallops were good, but my own home experiments with this seafood produced a more soft and juicy result.   My recommendation, give this place a wide berth.",

    "text": "We recently dined here because it was the closest restaurant that was still open for dinner service at 10:45pm on a Saturday.   Here are my comments:   1. Service - On the okay side. I think there was a little bit of confusion with the wait staff managing our table and two wait staffs kept asking us about water and placing our orders. But, the wait staff did do a good job in outlining choices and offered us the suggestion to go with the tasting menu, which was a really good deal for $60/person.   2. Appetizers - They were alright. I didn't really enjoy the shaved fennel that much because it was very bland. The garden salad tasted a little bitter. The quail was fantastic!   3. Entree - I thought the entrees was very good. I really enjoyed the flat-iron steak and the skirt steaks that was part of the tasting menu. They cooked the meat just the way we asked for and it came out with very powerful flavors. I didn't really enjoy the potato puree as much. I felt it was a bit salty for my taste buds. The Spinach was really nothing too special. I did like the mushroom side dish and it added a bit of a punch to our meat.   4. Dessert - We had a chocolate molten cake and a also a sticky bun type of item, which we really enjoyed.   5. Portion - Big portions. Our tasting menu could have easily fed 3 people. My girlfriend and I were stuffed midway through the entrees and we barely dented our desserts. It was sad to see such good food go to waste but we weren't going to bring it with us to the hotel.   Conclusion - Big portions, big flavors, great meats, be choosy on the on sides. I would definitely come back again!",

Our main server was very rude to us. Probably because we were younger. The manager however, fixed that with a round of free desserts. The desserts were all about $14 a plate. The only good thing about this restaurant after all that was the dessert!  Jasmine Tea Panna Cotta rocks!!! The monkey bread with home made ice cream, another winner!

Craftsteak was on her list, and I read some pretty awesome reviews so my expectations were pretty high...needless my expectations were never met.  SO disappointing. First we made reservations, and I made the reservations. Due to our large group they have a policy (9 or more people) that we'd have to order some sort of set menu that was $110 per person and 18% gratuity is added automatically. Ridiculous...I always think it's the restaurants way of saying we know our waiters/waitresses are being tipped so it's ok to give you crappy service cause we know it's being paid. WELL, to avoid this, I booked up two tables, first, I didn't want everyone to HAVE to pay $110 (Which was close to what we paid anyway), to eat something they might not have choosen, AND I always think tipping should be according to service. I use to be a waitress, I tip accordingly..if it's fantastic 20%, if it's ok 10% etc etc...  First we had reservations, but we still had to wait over 30 mins for our table, meanwhile they sat a table of 8 ladies moment before we were supposed to sit down. I had us sitting at a table of 6 and 7....not even an apology was given that they didn't have our table ready...and now we were all sitting together so again they have their 18% gratuity included.  Everything was a la carte, which most restaurants like this usually are. I must say the sides I did try and the ones I didn't I heard were great. The asparagus was grilled perfectly. Not too soft, not too crunchy, and the perfect char on them. The mushrooms were awesome, but you can't screw up mushrooms really. Potatoes and sweet potatoes were great, from what I heard.   OK - So bf ordered the bison steak, which is what I wanted but since I like to sample lots of things and bf knows he'll be eating half of my meal we decided not to order the same thing. I went with surf and turf..6 ounce filet mignon and half lobster tail. The lobster WAS delicious...the filet wasn't even cooked correctly. I always order medium rare...half of it was medium, and the other half was somewhere between medium and medium rare. I don't think they even SEASONED the steak. It just tasted like a piece of meat..no melting in your mouth, no flavourful bite, nothing. Bf's bison however...that WAS great. Cooked perfectly and accompanied with some delicious red sauce, a little sweetness to it with a little tang, along side another small dip...great.   We had some martinis, those were delicious..similar to a chambourg martini, with one more ingredient.  Someone else had the braised short ribs, and those were done well..but anything you braise for 24 hours will be fall off the bone delicious. Food was ok, not the best I've had, and certainly didn't live up to it's expectations....  It was packed, no doubt due to the name and Tom Colicchio being a judge on Top Chef..but for someone who made reservations two days ahead of time, and they didn't have our tables prepared...without even some complimentary drinks or BREAD for our 35, almost 45 min wait was extrememly disappointing of a five star restaurant...  This is a place you pay for service, and we certainly didn't get it...The waiter..he was the only saving grace of this place. He was awesome. I'll never go there again..for a great steak a fraction of the cost I'd even rather go to the Keg...at least they can cook a steak point on each time.....  Oh and ps. For the two birthdays we had and let them know..not even a whole piece of cake...just three itsy bitsy pieces of dessert. One small tiny square of what tasted like a skor bar, one small little cookie the size of a quarter, and some candied fruit thing that was gross...not even a nice piece of chocolate cake or something...thanks Craftsteak...we certainly won't go there again...",

We had the $105 Wagu steak. It tasted like a $50 steak. Save your money and go somewhere else. This place is highly overrated. The taste is bland and the meat juice is nothing special. The lobster bisque is just okay, the flavor is good and there are chunks of lobster but the soup is not creamy and thick. Don't believe the hype on this soup like I did and be fooled.",

    "text": "This sneaky little establishment might be good for some, but I have nothing good to say about it.  I had the Free Range Chicken and I suppose by keeping the bones in it they are able to give the \"organic\" feel, but I feel, if I'm spending that much for chicken, that the bones should be removed before I eat it to prevent having to remove them from my mouth after I've taken a bite.  And my boyfriend had the Italian Buffalo Mozzarella which consisted of three small meatballs for almost 20 dollars.  The place was a rip off as far as I'm concerned.  Oh and I can't forget to mention the lovely lady walking around with her camera offering to take pictures of our party, which I thought was nice, until she charged us $75 dollars a picture!  Vegas can be on the expensive side, but this was just outrageous.",

Meal, service, and ambiance did not disappoint. Portions were more than adequate and everything cooked to perfection with attentive but not overbearing service. Just wish we'd had time to really take it all in...def recommend for a quiet, classy meal.",

He thought that 9 orders (by the way $110 per order) would be plenty  food for 12 of us.....he was right.   Our meal started with casket iron baked bread (amazing), three different salads (amazing), like 5 different steaks and plenty of veggies (amazing and amazing).   To top it all off..........insane amount of varies deserts......(10 different scoops of ice cream, chocolate souffle, etc....cant remember the rest).  I think i must have gained 5 pounds after the meal.  Tom Colicchio is my idol.",

    "text": "I loved it here!   Here's what I would suggest though --- MGM Grand has this great VIP program called Prima. If you're willing and able to, you pre-pay $500 when you check in, and you can use that $500 towards food, drinks, etc., and you get pretty great discounts like 2 for 1 entrees, 2 for 1 drinks, etc.  So...what my boyfriend and I did was splurge on the $100 wagyu steak, but it was 2 for 1 =) They did kind of over-cook one of the steaks, so they gave us two, free desserts which was cool. All in all, our meal was supposed to cost over $300, but we spent about $180-ish for two Wagyu steaks, 2 sides, and 2 glasses of wine.",

I took some family and friends here during one of my Vegas visits and they all concurred... Craftsteak is in it to win it! Saying that it's a pricey place is an understatement, but trust me when I say, IT IS WORTH IT. I highly suggest you splurge on your visit here and order, \"In the box.\" You'll know what I mean when you peruse through the menu.",

I recommend the grilled rib eye steak and a nice martini. Also, the persian cucumber salad is to die for. The Jerusalem Artichokes are very nice. Really, it's all good. A fine, fine experience. Ask for one of the booths.  It's expensive, but not out of line with other fine steakhouses, and more reasonable than some. I actually enjoyed it more than Prime in the Bellagio (although Prime is very nice, too), and more than Delmonico's in the Venetian.",

It was a slow Monday night so I expected the best. I work in a 4 star steak house so my expectations were high. They were not met. Service was ok. The sommelier was friendly and knowledgeable. Two of our 7 steaks were grossly overcooked. The server tried very hard to sell me on my overcooked steak. I'm guessing the som was also the manager since he was the one to take my steak back, otherwise a manager never became involved. My recook came right out, however the other overcook didn't come out till the end of the meal. We boxed it to take with us. They comped my friends steak which is not what we were looking for, just a really good meal. Seven restaurant workers and nobody was impressed. This says volumes about an establishment. Save your money and try somewhere else.",
