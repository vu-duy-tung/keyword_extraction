    "text": "The late-night grave special at the Coronado Cafe isn't a five star dining experience when it comes to quality..  This review isn't granting a five star rating based off that.  A person can always find a better ham steak, cheeseburger, poached egg, and side of hash browns.  This is a five star place because The Coronado Cafe treats it's late-night menu as a throwback to old school Vegas.  for $1.45 you get the biscuits and gravy.  For $3.95 you get the steak and eggs, hash browns, jelly w/toast.  This is the Vegas I grew up in and around as a kid. It's the specials like this that made this city great and must be reclaimed.  Thank You Coronado Cafe!",

    "text": "This review is purely for their $5 steak and eggs!! Midnite-6am! ($4.95 to be exact).  Literally my boyfriend's favorite place in Vegas.  Last trip, we stayed in Vegas for 3 nights and ate here twice.  Also, since we always make him drive, he gets to nap in the car while my friend and I hit up $5 blackjack tables, heh.  This place is about 15 minutes south of the strip, so we'll either try to stop by on the way in from socal, or cross our fingers and hope someone is sober enough to drive us at the end of a clubbing night loll.  I always get my steak medium-rare and I've had no complaints with theirs!  It definitely beyond exceeded my expectations for only $5.  Also you get 2 eggs however you want them, hash browns, and toast!  I have yet to find as good of a deal as this one (and in vegas of all places!? incredible).  Go, gamble, drink, feast.  Maybe play a blackjack hand and pay off your dinner with it.",

This is a place to grab a cheap bite if your not in a mood for anything fancy. Do not expect to be blown away but if all goes well you should leave satisfied",

    "text": "South Point knows what they're doing with cheap after midnight specials on bowling, one dollar tap beer and one dollar well drinks, To make it even better Coronado Cafe offers 3.95 Steak and Eggs  The only reason i go here is for the steak and eggs and when i do it's usually between the hours of 12:00am to 05:00am.  True the slice of NY is on the thin side, the hash brown is quite greasy and often flavorless, and the eggs are also a bit on the greasy side. Who cares? It's really really early in the morning and here's cheap steak and eggs to help sober you up for the drive home.  Only issue is the South Point may be far for some and is off the beaten path in regards to the strip. It's location may be an inconvenience but with proper planning a lot of fun could happen at the South Point and continue right to Coronado Cafe before festivities end for the day",

    "text": "Coronado Cafe is located in South Point Casino waaaaay on the South side of Las Vegas Blvd.  We arrived around 4 a.m. and the place was PACKED (I heard members of our party that arrived before us were in line for about 20-30 minutes). I think it was worth it though.  I just may add this to my list of my after-clubbing dining options.  They had a kind of \"cab-drivers-specials\" menu available midnight to 6-ish I think.  Nothing was over $4.  The majority of our 12-person party ordered the $3.95 steak and eggs.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.southpointcasino.com%2Fpress%2Fcafe-graveyard-special.php&s=3adc0958634bf2f0680841e4d66f78a36e38386bcef54874a7dcb503549ce699\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">southpointcasino.com/pre...</a>  They also had a full menu as well as Chinese food.  Drink orders were taken promptly after we were seated as were our food orders.  We waited a reasonable amount of time considering the size of our party and how busy the Cafe actually was.  Our servers brought some crunchy chow mein noodle things with 4 different dipping sauces for us to munch on while we waited...   Bottom Line: Cheap eats after midnight.  Courteous and accomodating staff.  Just make sure you have a DD or cab fare because South Point is a bit of a drive from the Strip.",

Now, at these prices, the food won't blow your mind. It's good though; actually, better than I expected. Decent sized piece of meat cooked how I wanted (medium rare), eggs (over easy, and smothered in Tabasco), and toast. Other stuff is decent  too, if that's what you're in the mood for.   Keep in mind, the drunks come out at night for this. Strangely enough, I was completely sober at 3am.  I managed to have some drunk dudes randomly come up to my table for some nonsensical banter. I considered it table-side entertainment. The steak and eggs are keeping them happy, so I didn't mind. It was all in good fun.  Place is constantly packed, even at 3am. I'd expect a substantially longer line around the midnight hour.",

They have a list of the graveyard menus on the table, forget looking at the menu go straight for this.  It ranges from steak and eggs to burgers and biscuits with gravy.

    "text": "So like every hotel this is the South Points 24hr cafe.  To be honest its not much different then any of the others.  Decent selection of breakfast/burgers and sandwiches.  What makes this place special is 2 things.  1) they serve Chinese food.  Don't get me wrong its not the best ever but for this style of cafe, its great. (rice is a little dry sometimes)  2) the late night menu is the best!  From midnight til i think 5am you can get a maybe 8 or 9 different things dirt cheap.  Granted a lot of cafe's do some sort of late night menu.  I think the overall quality for what you are paying for is better here.  I may be off in my prices below but not by much.  biscuits and gravy for 1.45, a cheeseburger for 2.95 and the best, steak and eggs for 3.95.  I can't remember what the other items are.  My friends and I have gone here many a late night and the quality is always the same.  I think its hard to say that for regular restaurants let alone a 24hr cafe.  Sadly the word is out on this place and it has started to get a decent line were a year ago you could go right in.  Its still worth it as the wait is never too long.",

I asked my server (who had been extremely rude from the get go) if the spring rolls have any shrimp in them. He asked if I was allergic. I said no, but shrimp makes me queasy. We waited for 15 minutes. Nothing. Next, the female manager of the restaurant approached my husband and I said she could not serve us due to my allergy. I repeated that I do not have an allergy and that I eat here frequently. She said that it did not matter as the chefs do not clean the woks and utensils. Now, I understand not wanting to have an liabilty on your hands, however, she was extremely rude and didn't even offer for us to order something different. I am so upset I didn't get her name (heavy set lady with shorter dirty blonde hair). Instead just repeated that she could not serve us. When I asked to speak to someone above her, she refused. My family and I spend thousands of dollars at the south point every month (my mother is Pamela Chojnowski). I guess I will take my business to the M where they appreciate locals and don't kick them out and embarrass them.",

Starting off with the complimentary dry fried noodles....Haven't had these in years lol. Comes with the standard dipping sauces, and brought back more memories than enjoyment.  As for the GOOD, Salt & Pepper Sea Bass w/ Roasted Garlic ($23.95). EXCELLENT sea bass! Moist insides, light breading on the outside w/ strong garlic and salt & pepper finish!  The consistency of the fish was spot on, and the flavor was even better...highly recommended!  But for the BAD, Whole Imperial Peking Duck ($35.95). VERY disappointing, cooked way too long, with most pieces becoming dry and flavorless. Very LEAN duck as well...not much meat on these bones.  When the plate arrived to the table, I actually told the server that we didn't want the HALF portion...but was told we received the WHOLE duck!  Definitely NOT worth the money here.    Unless I got a very bad duck, I would run far away from this menu consideration.  I'm sure the midnight specials are the way to go here, or ordering selectively from the menu.  Perhaps the american choices are better represented?  Anyways, if you do eat here. order some sea bass for me!",

    "text": "Our group of seven ate here on the evening of August 5, 2018, and what an awkward and nauseating experience it was. Two of the three adults ordered the Chicken Schnitzel, and I ordered the Porterhouse done medium. The porterhouse arrived well done, but for the sake of good times and not wanting to cause a fuss, I initially let it go. But both the other adults cut into their chicken, looked at each other, and then sought my opinion because I've been a restaurant cook and a home cook for 30 years. It was pink. Now, we know that colour is not a reliable indicator of doneness, so I said to them, \"It's probably safe, but I would cook it two or three minutes longer to remove any doubt\". So they summoned the waitress and indicated the problem. Since their meals were going back, I showed the waitress that the steak was burnt. She apologized, correctly, and took our meals back. Meantime, the young lad at the table was eating his Mac and Cheese, and as the waiter topped up the boy's lemonade, he spilt 1/4 cup of lemonade directly into his meal. The waiter said, \"Oops\" and walked away. I noted also that the waiter topped up my Coke by pouring from a height (which is bad technique not only because of the danger of spilling, but because it unnecessarily releases fizz from the liquid). We got the waiter's attention and when he returned to our table and we reviewed what had happened, he mumbled incoherently. We all leaned in, struggling to understand what he was saying, but it was incomprehensible. After at least 90 seconds of agonizing back and forth, we established that the boy would receive chicken strips instead. Then my steak and the chicken arrived. To our great dismay, the chicken was pink again and so we summoned the waitress, who herself noted the unappetizing colour, returned with the general manager. She was abrupt, unhelpful, and, as it turned out, she lied to our faces. \"The chicken is cooked well done,\" she announced. \"The pink colour is from the marinade\", she finished. I know my recipes, and so I asked, \"What is the marinade?\". She answered that we wouldn't have to pay for the chicken meals, and left. My steak was of low quality, and I finished about half of it. My daughter, cheeky thing, asked the waitress to go ask the cooks what the marinade was. The waitress returned and announced, \"olive oil, rosemary, salt, and pepper\". And so the manager lied. I wanted to say, \"I'm coming back into that kitchen and I want every cook to gather round while I teach them all how to cook this dish\". What an embarrassing and awkward encounter. Never again. If the management replies to this review, I regret that I won't be able to respond.",

Our waitress was nice and attentive as well as the gentlemen refilling our drinks. The food however was very disappointing. My sister had an omelette that seemed like they forgot to put the ham and cheese in it and just threw it on top. It was not mixed into the egg. I had the chicken noodle soup which was served barely warm. For some reason the main ingredient was not chicken or noodles but onions. Overall our money could have bought us a much better meal elsewhere. The service, however, was great.",

They have cheap late night specials, but I think I'd rather haul my ass to Ellis Island for their food!  Service was SOOOOO slow.  Not only was service terrible, the food was even worse. We ordered several things. My boyfriend's dad ordered a soup from the Chinese menu. This dish was bearable. I ordered the country fried steak and eggs from the breakfast menu. It came with hash browns, biscuit, and toast. The country fried steak was TERRIBLE. It felt like the batter was made of eggs and flour and the meat was tough as well. I ordered the eggs poached, but they were completely overcooked. The worst poached eggs I've had, worse than those cooked in bulk at breakfast buffets. I ended up eating mostly biscuit and toast with jam and butter. The gravy itself was really good. The only highlight of the meal.  My boyfriend ordered the nachos. They were horrible. I don't even know what to say... He also ordered the steak meal and ordered it medium rare, as usual. The meat came back closer to a well done. It was terrible.   Overall, I wish I could turn back time and just eat at the Big Sur Oyster Bar next door.",

    "text": "$3.95 steak and eggs upped to $4.95 from 12am - 6am, but still super cheap!  I almost ALWAYS come here when I'm at Vegas. It's about 15 minutes south of the strip, so it's on the way from SoCal if you're driving in/out late at night. Everyone in my group always orders the steak and eggs. You get: steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, and bread (white, wheat, sourdough). A definite steal for $5.  Tip: I like to ask for Heinz 57 sauce, which tastes better than A1 steak sauce in my opinion. They keep it in the back, so you have to ask your waiter for it.  Also, South Point has $5 black jack tables, so sometimes we'll gamble while we wait!",

The salad was gross and was definitely not fresh. The chicken was extremely dry and chewy like rubber. The pesto sauce was cold and didn't even taste like anything but oil; the corn and rice was probably microwaved. After taking the first few bites, I couldn't finish. The other plates had burnt hash browns and moldy and stale bread. Overall, I will not be eating here ever again. It sucks.",

I'm not much of a fan of restaurants that cook up different ethnic styles of food in one place. The only decent item we had was the seafood soup which came with crab pieces and mushrooms. The others like bbq pork spareribs, BBQ duck and a seafood plate of hot and spicy shrimp and scallops were all not appetizing. They tasted bland and definitely needed more seasoning. The shrimp and scallops dish was deep fried, but tasted mushy with the added sauce.  They do offer a range of different options from American fare to Chinese plus some other choices. The prices don't seem too expensive as we didn't have to pay for our meal since it was comped by the hotel. I saw that they have late evening meal specials like steak and eggs, but never for Chinese food again except in a Chinese restaurant.  The service was good, but we did have to wait a bit for our dinner to be served. They even gave us a free serving of Cheesecake to help celebrate a birthday.",

I love this place because unlike some other places, you don't get to breathe in cancer causing smoke while you are eating. The ventilation is really good here. Service is above average.   The only thing you gotta worry about is sometimes there is a long line just right before midnight just so everybody can get those graveyard specials. So if you are already starving, you will probably get all cranky waiting to sit down and order. You might wanna pack a snickers cuz just like the commercial, you're not you when you're really hungry.",

We all sent it back and switched to the prime rib which was actually pretty good.  This experience tells me to stick to the menu items that are regular items and avoid the specials that are once a week items that limits the restaurant's prep experience.    Service was fantastic and the dining room is big so waiting times were reasonable.  I think it's funny that they have two menus: a regular traditional cafe menu and a separate Chinese/Asian menu.  From the outside you wouldn't know that there was a secret Chinese restaurant in this unassuming cafe.  There were several tables ordering from the Chinese menu and the dishes were served in distinct looking stainless steel platters.  From the looks of the food it seemed pretty good.   Give this place a try. If you don't like your order send it back and they will cheerfully replace it with something else and hopefully better for you.  Also if you visit after 11:30 pm -  the late-night menu is great and I don't think you can go wrong with the steak and eggs.",

The thing that I remember the most is that nobody said thank you the entire time I was there. I said hello to the host and all he said back was how many. The guy who took our drink order just stood there and said drinks? Our waiter said what would you like to order. So I am definitely not overexaggerating when I say there was no hellos, no pleasantries, nothing.   It wasn't to just me either. Everyone was equally rude to everybody. Maybe because it was a little before 6 and they were tired. Maybe the smoking gets to you and you become mad at everyone. Whatever the case this place needs a customer service overhaul.   Now I've got that out of the way, the food is decent. The steak was a nice size. I was very pleased for $4. I got it well done and it wasn't burnt. It had a nice charbroiled flavor. I needed to add salt and pepper, but I was very satisfied. The toast was good as well. They came lightly buttered and you can add jelly. I liked them with or without the jelly.   The hashbrowns were amazing! They tasted like they were cooked in butter! I have never had hashbrowns out this good. I traded my eggs for hashbrowns with someone at my table and I was in hashbrown heaven!  I will definitely be back! Even with bad service, nothing comes close to steak, potatoes, eggs AND toast for $4!",

The fried rice was luke warm and the dried noodles served with it we're stale. Another diner had the sweet potato fries which weren't crispy or tasty. The meal was so bad that we didn't eat any more meals at the hotel. Sad when your there for three days.",

The waiter was named Jennifer and she was rude and the shift supervisor gave us a lecture on telling us what we could have done to avoid it like we're kids. She blame us and said it was basically our fault that we didn't tell them. And they brought out the new steak within 5 mins and the steak was very rare when we order medium steak. They need to know the customer is always right and the shift supervisor need to know how to treat a customer instead of lecturing us. Won't ever come back again!",

The Chinese food is fantastic, they have the -best- pork egg fu young in Las Vegas i've had! Lots of yummy treats in it, and the brown gravy is thick and rich. I -crave- this! They also have daily specials, and they have always been a delicious value. Mondays, the roast pork loin is moist, tasty and for $10, you could not make it better at home, cheaper.  The porterhouse steak special is a HUGE let-down! It was tough and gristly, and just not good.  At midnite, they do have graveyard specials for $1.99 that are cheap and filling, and for the price, who cares if it's a tad greasy! It's a coffee shop, what do you expect!?",

    "text": "Casino resorts typically have one 24-hour cafe that serves the standard American diner fare.   The Coronado is that cafe for the South Point resort.   During a South Point stay in early May, we ended up at the Coronado three times.  Not because the quality of food was great, but rather because it was the path of least resistance whenever we wanted to eat quickly and somewhat inexpensive but still a sit-down meal.   For our three visits, while we were usually seated quickly, service thereafter was a mixed bag.   Sometimes our orders were taken promptly and the food soon came out, while another time we seemed to wait longer even though the place wasn't as crowded.    The dishes we chose did not all have the same level of quality to them.   A half Ham & Swiss sandwich was piled high with meat and was fairly tasty.   The \"George\" salad, however, was not good.   The choice of ingredients that comprised it did not seem to go well together, but worse would be the hard and unripe avocado slices that the evening's chef chose to serve it with.    For a breakfast meal, we split a Creole omelet, and that seemed OK.    Then on another dinner we tried the nightly special, which that evening was Salisbury Steak, and the Chicken Roma dish off the regular menu.   Both were decent.   The soups we had with the dinners were OK.   Nothing fantastic, but with exception of the salad we got, nothing horrible either.    Apparently this place offers a number of great breakfast deals from midnight to 5AM, so good that a nice-sized line can form of people wanting to get in when it begins.   Was never up late/early enough for that.",

    "text": "Ah yes, the famous $4 steak and eggs sometimes referred to as \"steggs\". Maybe it's my fault for not ordering the steggs but really at 1am my body was not feeling like steak. It just wanted fries... lots of fries!  I went with a large group 10+ people, and we waited in line outside to get seated. We played games so time passed by quickly (although in reality I think we waited around 30 minutes). After getting seated we ordered our drinks. I had a shirley temple. It didn't really taste like a shirley temple (not enough grenadine) but whatever I dealt with it because I knew that soon I would be eating fries!  I split a cheeseburger and fries with one of my friends.  The burger meat tasted a little off. It wasn't gamey but it tasted sort of like paper? I didn't finish my half of the burger because the texture and taste was so off that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The fries were alright, definitely not crispy enough but at least they provided us with ketchup, mayo, and some sort of thousand island dip!  Honestly if I lived in Vegas I could see this as a great place to hang out with friends. The food is really less than average but it's affordable in a relatively expensive city and it's open late! However I wouldn't exactly put this on my to-do list if you're visiting from out of town.",

No, it's not a gourmet restaurant but for what it is, it's great. My scrambled eggs were flavorful and cooked just right. The steak was probably not the best cut of steak but they cooked it the way I liked it and with a little A1 it was pretty good. We had to get the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and they were better than at most places. Loved their marinara sauce.   I wouldn't hesitate to go back for a cheap breakfast.",

Wish I'd read the description better :) my fault, i was expecting just a normal eggs/ham with hash browns on side.  Eggs with cheese disagrees with me.  I ate about half trying to pick off the cheese.  Wifes corned beef arrives as two dry slices of rye with corned beef.  Thats it.  No dressing, cheese, mayo, etc. Nothing very good about it, especially for $13.99.  Son inhaled his chix fried steak.  Waiters were prompt, courteous, water glasses/coffee kept topped off.  Food came out in 10 minutes, pretty good for how busy it was.  No discount for players card here.  The midnight specials looked like a great bargain, I might come back for that, but I'll skip breakfast/lunch here.",

Hubby orders us two steak and egg breakfasts which comes with steak, eggs, hash browns and choice of toast. I got my steak medium well, eggs over easy with wheat toast. That special costs $4.95. That is the cheapest steak and egg breakfast you can find in Vegas. It is inside South Point hotel which is off the 15 freeway.   Steak and eggs were delicious. Hash browns were cooked perfect. Steak was tender, and eggs and wheat toast were good. Our waters were refilled immediately as they were half empty. The waiters kept checking up on us. I like the great customer service here. You don't need a club card, but must be over 21 to get the grave yard specials. Good deal! Plenty of tables here, so the lines go quickly. I definitely would come back here for breakfast.

Whats funny is how the combo was $4.99 but a glass of soda was like $3.29 which was about the same as the combo itself but I guess thats how they make money on top. I ordered my steak medium well which was indeed cooked medium well but the steak was cold and bland. The eggs were cooked but didnt seem like freshly cooked. The only thing warm was the hash browns which was ok at best. Maybe if they cooked them all fresh to order then My opinion might have changed.",

Surprised at the number of servers (there were a lot, all over the place).  I ordered the steak and eggs (pik attached).  I asked for the eggs \"omelet\" style, was advised they could not do that for the graveyard special. Took about 10m to get it... total price with tax for the graveyard steak and eggs, $5.35.  It was just \"ok\", I certainly would not make a special trip here again for it.  I ordered the steak medium rare and can't say it was juicy.  Was dry and chewy.  But for the price...  Comparing this place to Ellis Island or any of the Village Pubs, they charge $7.56 for their steak and eggs, and the steak there is considerably better.  The Village Pubs, not Ellis Island (even though they have the same owner), have much better potatoes.  If I was looking for \"a deal\" on steak and eggs, I'd go to any of the Village Pubs, followed by Ellis Island, followed by Coronado Cafe (a very distant third).",

We were able to be seated in about 5-10 minutes.   I saw a table tent with a bunch of breakfast specials & some daily specials in the main menu. But, the 3 of us had our minds set on steak & eggs ($4.95). Its a 7 oz. steak with 2 eggs, hash browns and 4 (halves) pieces of toast. Ask for the hash browns to be extra crispy! They do butter their toast here so if you dont want butter, ask for no butter. I wish their toast was a little crispier but the food came out quickly and for only $5, I can't complain! The hash browns were a bit too soft for my liking, my steak was kind of dry looking but it was cooked medium, which was how I requested it to be. My friends' steaks were cooked medium rare (like they requested). I was very surprised that the cooks here did it right the first time. At other casino cafes, I've had to have them recook my steak for being too well done or too rare.   Service was pretty good. We were seated, presented with menus, and then someone came by to ask us what we wanted. I saw him refilling and bringing out drinks the entire time we were eating. Our order was taken shortly after.  Came here another time because primarily prime rib was closed for the day. Tried the prime rib here and itS decent! Not bad but I prefer the prime rib at Ellis island.",

Marlon and Jerseycate treated us very well, kudos to them!   The kicker is this great food is served 24/7. We'll be back!  This was only a small part of their generous menu.  When you don't want the hassle of the Vegas Strip check out South Point for food, gambling and they have an AMC theatre inside also.  Who could ask for more?\"",

My taste buds and my wallet were dancing with joy!   Secondly, the service is very good. I waited less than 10 minutes to receive my food and the staff was super friendly; my waiter came around every so often to refill my drink or to make sure everything was alright. He had good timing, not like some waiters who come to your table every five seconds, while you're chewing your food to ask if you need anything else. Or like some waiters who bring you your food, and you don't see them again till it's time to pay.  All I'm saying is, that Coronado cafe is my go to spot for grabbing good breakfast after work.

Service is good as well, never had a problem with any of the server yet, they are friendly. The only thing I hate is the food takes forever to serve. I get full by drinking my soda already. But anyway I recomend this ppace to my yelpers. By the way graveyard specials are good too. Very cheap. Steak and egg for $3.95 beat it!",

Nothing that wasn't extravagant or required reservations was open on Christmas, so my husband and I walked over here from the Grandview. I didn't think you could ruin something as simple as an omelet. They did. There was semi-melted sandwich slice cheese across my omelet. The eggs tasted watery and fake. The best part of my plate was the toast and jelly, because at least it tasted as expected. That's what I get for not planning a real place to eat on Christmas.",

The bacon eggs and hash browns were okay I guess but the bacon is thin super thin. The hamburger I order was horrible maybe because wartime wanted the breakfast specials.  I took one bite but the Fries were good the waiter was excellent and his assistant too, they refilled water and follow up with us.  He ran around crazy for his tables.  We tipped him as much as the bill came out on our check. He took my tha,burger off the tab because I didn't like it.  I didn't even have to ask for that and I wasn't even thinking that either,  I just didn't think the burger was good, it was well done and had a smoke burnt taste.  Yuck, I asked for it to be medium.  I wasn't complaining and said that it wasn't as good but it is okay.  He would get the five stars but the rating is for the value and the taste of the food. Sorry... Maybe it was a bad night??",

I turn red 'cause I'm like, it HAD to be the FOB Filipinos waiting here for the midnight specials. They WOULD come here at this time! Haha.   Right when it turns midnight, they get in line. My titas and titos are all staring at me and my friend like they got shit on us. Dang! Just drop it already! We don't know each other.  Pero anyways, the Steak and Eggs were good; if you order it Medium Rare or Well Done, it doesn't seem to matter, they look and taste the same! Slightly red inside but delicious nonetheless. I can't say the same for the burgers! They were bland and were not marinated but you can't complain 'cause it's dirt-cheap and it's during graveyard hours. Graveyard-hours food tends to taste bad anyway unless you're FADED.   Service here is good too. A good, affordable place to take your tourist friends/family after a night of drinking since it's closer to the strip but I prefer the Sourdough Cafes in both of the Arizona Charlie's locations.",

Every now and then it drops to \"Crappy\" but if you know this going into things then you're ready for it. We were there as a big group for the week and the general consensus was the same as mine for the entire group. I had the chicken fried steak.. the hash and eggs and some sort of omelet over the course of the week and it was all just ehh.  I finished my breakfast every time but one.. the omelet was just plain not good and I left half of it and forced everyone to pause while I stooped on our way to our event to \"Speak into the Clown\" at a local drive-thru.   The service was friendly every time but once.. (I'll get to that in a minute) but is HORRIBLY slow... painfully, agonizingly, annoyingly slow..  I can guarantee you two things.. 1.) You WILL wait forever. Not so much for your food as it comes fairly quickly but for the server to do anything.  2.) Your beverage WILL go empty and sit there for a while like that.   Recommendations for the Coronado cafe??  1.) Go someplace else if you can.  2.) Budget LOTS of time.  3.) If dining alone... bring a book or something.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try the infamous Steggs (Steak and Eggs) special at South Point for awhile, and we finally made it out. Boy we were not disappointed. So this review is specifically for the graveyard experience. 5 stars because honestly, you get what you pay for. If you are expecting fine dining steak, well you shouldn't be paying $5 for it. The priciest graveyard special is the steak and eggs (7 oz steak, 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and 2 toasts) for $4.99. Other specials include hamburger and fries, biscuits and gravy, ham steak, etc. For the price you pay, the food was good. It was about the same level in taste as a Denny's yet even cheaper. But it's not all about the food. There's something special, if not unique, about the experience of chowing down on some freshly fried hash browns drenched in egg yolk porn with a meaty steak among other crazed casino nightmongers. We arrived close to 1 AM, and there was a throng of people waiting to get seated. The line moved fast, and before we knew it, we were behind the fences, surrounded by people of all ages and nationalities. I even saw families with young children grubbing down to some steak and eggs. It was a fun experience and I enjoyed people watching as much as I enjoyed the food. We will definitely come back again, despite not being fans of eating past 8 PM. Note: you can't get take out, but you can get boxes for your unfinished food.",

The service is also pretty fast, you don't have to wait long to be seated because the cafe is pretty big. The only thing that I wish they did were refills for their juice drinks. The juice are sometimes just as expensive as your meal but it will be in a really small glass (smaller than the water glasses) and they will charge you if you want refills. I wish that they would use bigger glasses. The only alcohol they serve is wine (really cheap wine). It would be better if they served beer as well, as it's a good combination with the steak. Try this place next time you're looking for a cheap place to eat at after midnight. You won't be disappointed.",

Since the truck stop is close by, we decided to try their $14.95 porterhouse steak and prime rib. My prime rib was so tough I couldn't chew it, the baked potato was obviously nuked and had been sitting around awhile. My brothers steak was also tough. The only thing that was edible was the salad. I was embarrassed, especially since he insisted on paying the bill for 5 people who also ordered the special. I will go back,but will order a sandwich or Chinese. Very disappointed..",

My party of 6 got carded, each and everyone of us, Asian kids. Yes. I got carded to eat breakfast wtf.  The Graveyard Special are breakfast entrees for much cheaper prices from 12am-6am. Steak and Eggs (steggs as call by the locals) is $4.95, my coffee $2.95 =/  The service: The line is long. This is a popular steggs location. The service is friendly, but a bit disorganized. So 4 stars for service.  The food: Bleh. There were 6 of us. 6 orders of stegg medium rare. Steggs is 7oz new york steak, 2 eggs, a side of hash and toast. We received 6 different quality of steaks. 1 medium rare, 4 medium, 1 well, 1 almost rare. My steak was well and very dry. The eggs: I asked for scrambled and the waiter asked \" Do you want real eggs\". What there are fake eggs (probably egg substitutes and the like)? Real eggs scrambled = country scramble. The hash: very typical. A little bit crispy on top, but mostly mushy. The toast: I got sour dough and I thought it was the best part of the entree. I liked my coffee though, but I was just happy to have decent coffee. So 1 star for food.  The price is the only reason I ate here with friends. I personally would not bother coming back. There are a gazillion other Steggs places and places to eat after midnight in Vegas.",

Last night, we decided to go late bowling and have a 2am breakfast there. The cafe was full of patrons with a line to get seated but we managed to be seated within 10-15 mins, so that wasn't too bad. Once we were seated it was bad news. 15 more minutes to be noticed in the corner where they sat us. We made our food order, Chicken Salad and Lox and Cream Cheese Bagel. Nothing needing to be cooked and 2 glasses of water. It took 45mins to be served! The waitress forgot the bagel and at first was going to argue that it didn't come with one until she read the ticket, abruptly stopped her sentence and walked away bringing a bagel 5mins later. My wife's Chicken Salad was dry and tasted like the chicken had been sitting a while. Then they never refilled our water glasses. I asked the waitress on 2 occasions for a water refill and it never came. Then as we left and I told her we never got our water, she just smiled and said \"Have a nice day.\" I know things can get pretty busy for waitresses and their staff but they do have busers to help them and we only saw ours once. Needless to say, we won't be going back to that restaurant for while if ever again. Too many other places to go and be taken care of in Vegas to go back to that mess.",

    "text": "It was my first time eating Steggs (Steak & Eggs) here last night. I was pretty excited to try it, because all of my friends have been talking about the $5 Steggs deal after midnight. The food was not so great. You get one piece of steak, eggs of your choice, hashbrowns, and your choice of toast. My steak was a pretty decent size, however, it was so hard to cut (they didn't have any more steak knives) and to eat. I asked for a medium-rare steak but they gave me a rare steak, which I wasn't too happy with. It also had no seasoning what so ever. The hashbrowns tasted like clay and my eggs were very watery and I'm pretty sure they were still somewhat raw (I got them scrambled). The sourdough bread was alright. Our waiter was very patient with us, but the lady up front who is in charge of checks was super rude and very unpleasant. But it was $5 for steak, eggs, hashbrowns and bread. I wasn't expecting a super great meal, but honestly it could of been much, much better. Also, now they changed the policy, and you have to be 21 to order steggs, which is complete bs. They are going to lose a lot of business from teens and young adults.",

Unfortunately it's off the strip which is about a 20 minute drive. This would be the only downside in getting this fine late night snack.  Food: I mean come on, 7 oz steak, eggs, hash browns, and choice of bread is more than enough for $4.95. They only offer this special from 12am-6am. The steak has ton of flavor and you can have the eggs made your way.   Staff: The line is long because most people are drunk or craving a midnight snack at this time. But it does come by pretty quick. The staff is nice and friendly. I haven't had a bad experience here yet. Right when you get seated, someone is there to take your drink order followed by the waiter/waitress.   Highly recommend this place for those who want some good steak and eggs!",

Traditional breakfast and lunch are served is huge portions at an exceptional price. The pancakes are huge and moist. They taste like heaven.   There is plenty to chose from on the kids menu as well. The chicken fingers are huge! And fries are super crispy, this is plenty for 2 kids.  The service was top notch. We had 2 busers and 1 waitress who kept our glasses full and even stopped by for a chat.

There were 3 other steak orders. 1 was cooked correctly as my mother ordered her steak well-done and got it as ordered. My brother and sister both ordered medium steaks, but received them borderline well-done. I wanted our server. Elizabethx who was sympathetic to our situation,  to just pass on to the cook that he/she needs to do better. Elizabeth came back saying the cook offered to make another steak. Usually we would take them up on the offer, but our orders took nearly 40 minutes long that we were all just not in the mood to wait any longer (it wasn't even overly busy. We all took a few bites, couldn't deal with the tough meat at the moment, so we just packed up the rest to go. I usually don't need any condiments or toppings with my steaks, but i had to pour the remaining contents of the A1 sauce onto my steak in my to-go container.    The best part for my sister and I was the bread we received. Perfectly toasted and flavorful. My brother was digging his soup the most. Also, my brother's plate came with onion rings. Mine did not.   I took a comment card and am going to make sure i let them know they messed up. I don't want others to have the same experience",

    "text": "After seeing their $4.85 for Steaks & Eggs midnight - 6 am I decided to give it a try.  After all who isn't up at those hours while in Las Vegas, right?  My daughter and I had walked by earlier and had noticed quite the line to enter the place, so we were excited to try it out.  We went about our business in the casino for about an hour and noticed that suddenly there was no line. Perfect we headed over and were nicely greeted and promptly seated.  We ordered a hot chocolate and a Pepsi. Both were $3.49.  Yikes almost as much as the entrees  I ordered the Steak Special which included a 7oz NY steak (I ordered it medium rare) 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast.  My daughter ordered the $3.95 1/2 lb Burger with Cheese and fries.  She had hers medium well with pepper jack cheese.  I will say that it took a good 15-20 minutes from the time we sat down until our order was taken. (The drinks were taken within 7 minutes)  Once our food arrived the first thing I noticed was that my steak was not medium rare.  It pretty much looked well done.  Argh.. I thought to myself.  I was contemplating sending it back.  My daughter reminded me, it's only $4.95.  Of course her hamburger looked delicious.  I cut the steak more on the center and saw it was medium well in the middle section. I said to myself, I'll cut my losses after all it's only $4.95.  Now that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4.  (Definitely not 5 star).  The value for the $3.95 and $4.95 is excellent, however I feel that their food should still merit the attention the Porterhouse steak they sell.  Or even this same plate during normal business hours.  (Maybe it's the same attention then?)   Ok.  So final verdict.  Is it a good deal, yes.  We're a big part of the customers half drunk to even notice if their steaks are cooked a la perfection, probably not.  So if you are hungry, happen to be near the South Pointe Casino, between midnight and 6 am, Como enjoy the $4.95 Steak Special or what seems to be the better deal the $3.95 1/2 lb Burger with fries.",

I don't usually give reviews for steggs since we've been here multiple times and expect an average service, but I just needed to applaud our server Nathan from Puerto Rico (that's what his name tag read). We have been here for many years now just for their steggs, but never have I received such an awesome service during a graveyard shift. I'm not exaggerating when I say that he was full of energy and made us all laugh. He presented himself with an aura that made you want to ask for him again next time we visit. The service itself made our dining experience at this establishment  wonderful. The food was prepared properly since it wasn't too busy.. it seemed the cooks were able to really cook my friends' steaks to their liking.  Thank you Nathan for the excellent service. Keep up the great work and never lose such an eccentric personality!",

Food comes out at a decent speed and the quality is actually better than what you would expect for only 3.95! You get steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, AND toast.  I would recommend going \"one down\" on your steak preference (ie if you like medium, go medium rare) because they crank them out and usually aren't the best at keeping track of all the temperatures. But other than that, it's a solid steak. Hash browns are crisp on the outside and a little soft in the middle. Eggs are cooked nicely and the toast comes buttered for you. Besides the steak/eggs, if you're extra hungry - the biscuits and gravy are a great pick to share. Decent biscuits and the gravy packs a good amount of flavor.   Overall, really solid place to eat at when you've had some adult beverages and need something cheap and (somewhat) fast to eat. This is one of those rare occasions where the quality is actually better than what you pay for.",

Bottom line, not a bad place to eat for 2 in the morning. Reasonable prices!",

I ate twice here, breakfast was lox and scrambled eggs and the next day lunch was a turkey burger. I would say both meals were better than I expected.    I would probably go here again if I was in the area and wanted a quick no frills meal.  I put it in the same category as ihop, Denny's or Cocos but better than all of them.

So a must is always the mid night special. I get the medium rare steak with scrambled eggs and sour dough bread dry with a hot water (water is free). I've been coming here since I was 16 and it's seriously sad to watch such a beloved cafe become sooo poor in food quality! Service has always been terrible but never their quality of food! They always made up for the long waits with the deliciousness! But recently. Coronado cafe has dramatically taken a turn for the worst. Their steak is no longer a decent size nor does it hold the flavor a steak should, the hash browns are smashed potatoes that a baby would think is play food, and the eggs are still soggy with yolk? (I thought scrambled meant no yolk?) BUT the ultimate deal breaker was how disrespectful the cashier was. Since I get the same order every time I was baffled by them charging me 4 dollars for a \"hot tea\" (I OBVIOUSLY had my own vibrant tea package). & when I addressed the issue with the cashier she blamed me for the \"miscommunication\" due to not discussing the issue with the waitress who only delivered my food once, never hearing from her again (Dora was her name).  Correct me if I'm wrong but charging me for an item that I brought is unrealistic. & ever since when was the customer wrong? Customer service was bafflingly pathetic and inexcusable. As for a customer coming back any time soon? I am not in that category any longer. I truly hope that this cafe improves. They're losing such valuable locals. I sure won't be back any time soon!!!!!",

The midnight happy hour menu deal goes on everyday from 12AM - 6AM. It's a bang for the buck. The quality is nothing to rave about since it's not like you're paying double digits. However, outside the discount, this food can be quite pricey for its quality.  Service is above average. Because these midnight hours are the busiest, they tend to be inconsistent but as a man of value, I'll never argue with this value.",

I was more of a fan of the biscuits and gravy (1.95) or the cheeseburger (3.95)  Unfortunately, I will NOT be frequenting here anymore. The catastrophic demise came a few weeks ago. If you are a creature of the night and venture here please be forewarned that somewhere between 3am-4am they are doing credit reports and their system will not allow payments with anything but cash. So.. at 4am you are left to stand around a counter in a drunken sleepy state while the system is \"reporting\"  This happened for the second time a few weeks ago and we were standing there for about 10 minutes when I asked to speak to a manager - Finally someone came up-- obviously not the Manager, expressed no sympathy. I told him this was the second time this happened and its frustrating when its 4am and you have to wait 15 minutes to pay your bill. He seemed frustrated with  me and gave me a disgusting grimace and walked away. pshhhhhh ....   Sucks.. Now I gotta find a better spot for late night grub.. Maybe Terribles?",

Hours later after my meal, I had concluded that the rice was too dry. Ever try eating dry rice? Let me know how you like it.   Came back again for the graveyard specials. Long line. Not worth the wait. Got the $5 steak and eggs and $4 cheese burger. First the water server dropped a plate in lemons in the table with our waters and I immediately pointed in hair on the lemons. He didn't seem to care of bothered to say sorry. Just picked up the plate and walked away.   The steak and eggs. Gross. Steak was overlooked and dry. Told my friend it felt like I was eating a dry sponge. No flavor. Nothing exciting.   The burger. Again. Gross. Tasted like cardboard. Not even ketchup helped. Fries that came with my burger were cold and mushy.   I guess this is what you get for vegas dining experience. Just don't go here. Save yourselves.",

This was my third time in Vegas, and there was one Vegas tradition that I had not checked off my list yet - grabbing a late night special from a casino diner. So off I went to the Coronado Cafe!  Not surprisingly, the place was about half full at 3:30 AM. I opted for the \"Pancake Sandwich\" late night special - 2 pancakes with a slice of ham stuck in-between, and a fried egg on top. Egg was cooked perfectly, and I broke the yolk to make a runny mess on the plate, then added syrup. Pancakes were OK, a bit dense. Coffee was, well, late night diner coffee. Go to Seattle's Best near the casino entrance for a good cup during the day ... at the late night, this was acceptable.   Coronado Cafe is nothing mind-blowing ... it's just basic late night casino/diner food prepared fairly well. I'd recommend another option at South Point during the day (Del Mar Cafe, Steak N Shake), but Coronado Cafe is fine for the late night casino munchies.",

Who was rude and could not understand anyone's order--he only spoke English, so language was not his problem--it must just be stupidity. My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich and was concerned he got that wrong--she tried to confirm with him he'd received her correct order. He said, in a dismissive tone, \"yeah, yeah, I got it.\"  He didn't. He brought the totally incorrect order. When it arrived he tried to argue with her as to what she'd ordered. Once her corrected order finally arrived the rest of the dining party was completely finished with their meals. He then seemed pleased with himself when his incorrect order was removed from the ticket--while still fully charging for the VERY late order. It took 30 minutes and four different \"supervisors\" to get the bill to reflect the poor service for breakfast. I would NEVER recommend this restaurant. If staying at the SouthPoint, get in your car and drive elsewhere for breakfast.",

The cut of New York steak was visibly better than some others I've had lately. It wasn't the most tender on the inside, but still good. In any case, it's easily one of the better steak and egg graveyard specials in town. My cousins also seemed to enjoy the items they ordered.

That being said perhaps it was just bad luck.. but I personally don't care for much at Southpoint restaurants in general. I think this place is ok for convenience and I'd imagine they can't mess up eggs so breakfast is probably ok but do not go here thinking you are going to engage in fine dining or even yummy diner kind of dining.  Not recommended really, in my opinion just go to the coffee shop and eat a bakery item to hold you over til dinner. :P",

And all was good.  First time I ever made it out there was earlier this week. The steak and eggs special was $4.95 from midnight to 6am. But as people often become when they stay up late, we were hungry, And so we went.  The older gentlemen taking our orders was very efficient in going through the routine of asking how we wanted our steak cooked, our eggs done, and our bread choice... uh, chosen.  Anyway, I got a medium rare with scrambled eggs and wheat toast. The steak came out cooked about right, but that protein was pretty tough to chew. The eggs were pretty cool, and the toast was definitely nice with the jellies provided (strawberry, orange marmalade, grape). Hash browns tasted fine with ketchup but were otherwise a somewhat disappointing, mushy-below-the-surface concoction.  If I was here at the right time or night, I'd order it again. But it's not a destination of choice for uber-late dining.",

Moreover, the pricing on the Chinese food was too expensive for the poor quality unfortunately. It's Vegas and normally it'd be cheap, but the (Chinese) food was *sorry* awful! P.S. Please learn how to make steamed rice correctly!",

But tonight i came in as a enthusiastic paying and tipping  customer and after purchasing 2 plates of food for myself, My friends  were denied (with a smile) from ordering more then 1 plate. When i waited tables i went the extra mile to make sure my guests were satisfied with they're service, which obviously wasnt a priority at this joint. I worked for tips guess they work for peanuts and are happy with it, or prejudging us because of race. stream-lining average food and complacent service will not have us returning. I won't be back hear and will spread the word about the average food and crappy service. This joint is below a Denny's service and-n-food wise!!!",

The steak is 7 oz and its okay for the price you pay. When drunk it may be the perfect thing!   The wait is pretty long, so I suggest coming at 11:50pm to avoid the wait or coming at 2. Otherwise it will be a 15-30 min wait. We arrived at midnight and the wait was 15mins.   The server was patient with my party of 10 and I gave her a nice tip. Overall good place.

My brother sat up like he was told and told the manager that she didn't have to be so rude about it. That's were she lost it and called the security to kick my brother and his group out. They were not drunk nor they were loud or out of control. When I found out what happened, this manager started to lie about what had happened and was also giving me an attitude for asking her what had happened. For a person that works in hospitality industry, this person lacks manner and professionalism.  I'm always playing at this casino and always go the coronado cafe. I spend thousands of dollars playing here and to be treated like this is unacceptable especially if we didn't do anything wrong.",

Years ago a mediocre cafe such as this would have been the norm for a town like Vegas, but the culinary winds have changed and the lower quality food and cooking methods are a disgrace to hotel eating.  The food here is schlock house quality at best, nothing to write home about.   I had the pasta and it was one of the most horrendous dishes I've had in quite some time an insult to Italian food, sauce tasted like ketchup.  Once again it's better to either stick to the slots or avoid this place altogether. This casino needs to borrow some moves from their competition and get a celebrity chef onboard ASAP.",

Our server, Cathy, was very accommodating, and let us sub the chicken sausage pon the side with their special. Cathy let the kitchen know, and she says it would be a little longer because they needed to clean a grill (they cook the potatoes with the pork)  We were fine with that!  Then the food came... My veggie frittata was flavorful, but the clear winner was the Coronado Special my kid & mom split was amazing! My kid doesn't eat even chicken sausage normally, but tried it. Her smile & face was wow! (Usually even chicken sausage has pork casings, patty has no casing). Tasted like home cooked, great service (never ending coffee) , loved server Cathy from Jackson!!

The yams had maple syrup poured on them not glazed and the green beans (which were the only edible part of the meal) were cold and under cooked.

I come here for the steak and eggs. The idea of steak & eggs is genius for a midnight meal. It's like the last of dinner and the beginning of breakfast. Yeah, yeah call that a \"tina-moment\" but you know you're still thinking about it.  I've heard some say that the steak is alright... Well, if you haven't yet, I suggest ordering it MEDIUM. Not medium rare or medium well. just straight MEDIUM and it should be perfect. Perfect for $3.95.  I'd say the vibe is much better than any other place I've gone for some graveyard specials. It's crazy how people are still up at 3am craving some steaks! It's definitely safer than sleeping pills, I think.  Anyway, take my word. And when you get the steak&eggs.. mix it all up. I usually don't like my food mixing, but breakfast is the only exception, like paramore.  Oh and one last thing.. If you're not a steak&egg person.. They have other specials, like pancakes and stuff.

The thick slice of ham was super savory and tender.. i liked it better than my steak. the gravy that accommodated the biscuits was seasoned really well and had small chunks of sausage in it.  the server was very attentive and super sweet. she came around frequently to check on us and even chatted with us for a bit despite how busy the cafe was.  our check was around $20 for enough food to last us at least two full meals. we're definitely down to make the 10 minute trip from the Strip for steak and eggs, given that at least one of us is semi-sober enough to transport us here.",

The line was super long and we waited for about 45mins. I wasn't upset about that since it was a 3 day weekend. Once we sat down, we ordered the special and the server George was horrible. He was so rude!   When we got our steaks, I asked for mine to be medium and when I got my steak it was like beef jerky. When I told my server about the tempura of my steak he argued about me and said I wanted Medium-well. I explained to him, even if I did want a medium-well steak, this is WELL DONE! He rolled his eyes and took my steak away.   I just told him, I lost my appetite and don't want it anymore. Out of the 15 of us there, maybe 4 of them had the right steak temperature.    I guess that's what you get for late night $4.95 steak special. ..  NEVER AGAIN!",

They have this late night special that runs from 12 am to 6 am in the morning and incredible deals on different breakfast items. Their most famous dish that I personally like to get is the NY steak & eggs combo, which is only $4.95!  My only markdown to this spot is that because its open so late the service is variable and can take a while to be served properly or even respectfully. It is especially bad when it is busy at night as it can be hard to get service or seated immediately either.  But I definitely recommend this spot during a late night meal craving after parties or events in Vegas. This is my best go-to so far!",

    "text": "If I could give 0 stars, I would. Last night when I came here, the service was BEYOND awful. It was the night of NYE so of course there was a long line and a long wait for our group of 6 but once we were seated, we weren't even greeted by a server for 5 minutes. Didn't get any waters or drinks for 10 minutes. We get our orders taken after having been seated for almost 15 minutes, all very simple orders that are basically the same with a couple orders of sides. So we're waiting and waiting and it's been another 15 min now. Mind you, usually the food is out in a timely manner but at this point, we see a group get seated and they're bigger than our table, and they have their orders taken right away. Another 10 minutes go by and THEY GET SERVED BEFORE US. I'm looking at their plates which consist of the SAME food! Steak and eggs! And so, all of us are sitting there, extremely hungry, watching this bigger group that got here after us and got served before us eat there food. We become frustrated and my boyfriend asks to speak with a manager. Her name is April Pitpit. He politely explains our situation to her and she goes to the kitchen to check on our orders. She comes back and tells us, our food is covered and will be out in 2 min. The entire time we had been waiting not ONCE did our server check on us or refill our waters which were empty. But, two minutes later she comes out with our food, doesn't even remember which plates go to which person, doesn't bring out one order of biscuits and gravy because she forgot and didn't put it in, and one of the eggs for the steak and eggs was over hard when it should have been over easy. My friend who is extremely annoyed now, waits another 5 minutes and the big group that was seated after are just about finished with their food. We eat our food and get our check and because our experience has not lived up to our usual expectation, we decide to ask for April, the manager my boyfriend spoke with earlier, to express our concerns with the service we received. My boyfriend CALMLY and POLITELY addressed the issues with our orders, the waiting time, and since he works in the restaurant business and understands what it means to make it right for the customer, he asks to at least get the one order that was messed up, comped or at least given a 10% discount. Just something to make it right since we had a terrible experience on what was supposed to be our post celebration dinner!  Instead of making it right however, April decided to make a huge spectacle of it. She retorted that the bigger group was served before us because they had \"simpler\" orders which 1. it shouldn't matter what the orders are and 2. they ordered steak and eggs just like we did and they were a larger group which means they had MORE orders to be fulfilled so that made no sense. Then, she went on to say that they \"made it right\" for my friend who's order was placed incorrectly when they served him 5 minutes later with a new plate that was the correct order. I'm sorry but making your customer wait an additional amount of time because you messed up their order is NOT making it right. I just stood there and listened to her repeat herself and thought, WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS SO DIFFICULT? Instead of acknowledging our complaints and compromising to find a solution, she continued to show a lack of concern for us at all. My boyfriend at this point is repeating himself because she isn't doing anything to help and she then claims he has an \"attitude\" and threatens that if we don't pay the bill that she's going to call security.  WE NEVER EXPRESSED THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO PAY THE BILL, we were simply just asking if there was anything she, AS A MANAGER, could do for us because our experience did not meet the standard expectations. April ended up calling security anyway and four security officers showed up and rudely told my friend he wasn't allowed back at the Cafe. April FINALLY made a decision and comped us one of the plates and the side order of the fruit cup. This whole ordeal was so dramatic and could have easily been avoided if April had been nice and willing to HELP us. How hard was it to say \"Oh, I am so sorry that you experienced this. We always strive to provide good service and because you did not receive that tonight, I will take off one of the steak and eggs and the fruit cup. I hope this is to your satisfactory and that you dine with us again. Thank you and have a good night!\"  I never write these kind of lengthy reviews, especially not BAD ones but you killed our good vibes and that isn't something I appreciate. I hope management above April Pitpit sees this and considers retraining her or the staff as a whole about what it means to provide excellent customer service. After all, this is Vegas and you should know better.",

If you've never been to this cafe for their late night specials, you are seriously missing out. They offer super cheap steak and eggs (like $5 cheap), as well as biscuits and gravy and a bunch of other stuff.  Now that we have a baby, we aren't able to catch those awesome graveyard specials any longer, but they still offer great values at dinner time as well.   Their daily special is either prime rib or a porterhouse steak for $14.95. The meal is served with a potato and veggie side, as well as choice of soup or salad. We're not talking gourmet here, but it's a great meal for the price.  I recently discovered the sausalito burger and love it! It's what I think a patty melt should be - it has buttery, toasted bread and is super delicious!  Be warned - although this restaurant is huge, there is regularly a wait! The service is always fast and friendly and we've enjoyed our meals there.",

The bad thing was we had only eaten a few spoonfuls and they brought our entree.  That drives me crazy!   Totally a server issue, not the kitchen.    I had ordered the turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing.  My meal was hot and plentiful.  The real turkey was sliced very thin and the dressing was good.  The mashed potatoes had many big lumps of unmashed potatoes in them.   My husband had the pork special and it was enormous.  He said it was very tasty and his mashed potatoes were better than mine.   Sadly our room didn't have a refrigerator or we would have taken leftovers back to the room.     Overall, atmosphere was fine, service mediocre, and food decent.",

You sit get.your beverage and before you read the expansive menu your server wants to take your order. DO Not let them leave, they vanish to some mystery hideout.  My poor wife has had zero luck, ordered sausage patties, they were actually hockey pucks, no chance of being eaten...don't sorry no one will ask how your is going. She ordered chili next trip NO onions, which must mean extra onions.  I ordered the chili earlier the same day and had to ask for onions and cheese. Last night after PBR ordered the porterhouse, everything was cold, the gravy was worse than cold, what could have a great meal turned so so fast, at least the steak was as ordered. Anyway my review was based on two trips yesterday, and last visits.",

I cannot remember our waiter's name but he was probably the most helpful one I've ever encountered on my visits here.   I have a younger cousin who is allergic to shellfish and when my Aunt was trying to order him chicken fingers, he kindly warned us against it because apparently they cook/fry the seafood and everything deep-fried on the same grill/fryer. He gave them plenty of other alternative options and was very knowledgable. He also double-checked on a lot of the foods to make sure it was safe for my cousin to eat. Later on the manager approached us and I'm guessing he told her about our situation and apologized for the inconvenience and pretty much repeated what our waiter had already mentioned about the grill.   At first I was kind of upset that they couldn't maybe just get a separate pan or something to cook his chicken fingers in but our waiter was really informative and nice about everything, I was just glad he mentioned this rather than my cousin have a terrible reaction.  I'm still not a HUGE fan of the food here other than $4.95 steggs hence the 4-star rating but I was really pleased with the service :)",

    "text": "This review is purely based on the Graveyard Specials. My friends and I decided to come here around 12 AM for a late night birthday dinner and my friend was really excited to go here. First thing to note is that it is located in South Point Hotel. You go inside and you should be able to navigate it, note that there will be a wait. We waited for about 30 minutes and were seated. We all got the 7 oz NY steak, two eggs, hash browns, toast and jelly, all for 4.95. For that price, I was very skeptical at first and when the food came out I've coulda sworn my steak was overcooked. However, all our steaks came out to our liking, my steak was a perfect medium rare, and my friend's steak was a perfect medium well. The steak is very tasty that it did not require A1 steak sauce, only salt and pepper needed. The scrambled eggs were nice, the hash browns were standard diner hash browns and the toast was a good way to end the meal on a good note. The reason why this place gets a 5 star is because the service is amazing, water refills were constant and we did not have to even ask, waitresses were very kind and asked if everything was ok, the food came out very quickly, and the quality of the food was good even if you take out the fact that it is only 4.95 for all that food. The steak is better than Norm's, Denny's, and other standard diner chains' steaks. I would like to give a special shoutout to Dawn for being so kind to me and my friends, definitely one of the best waitresses I have ever had. It would be a misSTEAK not to go here!",

    "text": "OK so I came for the midnight special of the $4.95 steak and eggs. There was a bit of a wait but dude for $4.95, I expected there to be a line. We got seated after around 10 minutes. So steak and eggs. Steak is 7oz and probably not going to be cooked the way you want it. I asked for medium rare and got like a medium well. Kind of total opposite of the spectrum but I am not going to complain because I saw this coming for the price. Overall though, even though it wasn't cooked right, the value for what you get is something you can't complain about. You get eggs, steak, hash browns, and toasts. On top of that, the service was pretty good. The server came by several times to ask us if we needed anything. She was kind and I couldn't have asked her to redo the steak.  Other deals also available at night. Would probably not come at other times but maybe the food might be a bit better during non-peak times and not with these value prices. If you are near South Point though at night and looking for a hearty meal, I say go for it! (But don't be ubering here after a night of clubbing on the strip unless u are literally staying at South Point of M Resort...)",

Well,  service is not the best and I experienced the worst of it on my last visit.   I understand it was a busy Saturday night and I wasn't in a rush so I calmly waited for the waitress to take my order at the bar. I already know what I was going to order. A five minutes later a gentleman sat next to me and we talked while waiting to get taken cared of. The waitress finally  comes up and asked the gentleman what he wants to order. He so kindly tells her that I was here 1st.  I order my meal Steak (Medium Well) & Eggs (Scrambled) with Wheat Bread.  Gentleman next to me orders the same but with his Steak rare.   After awhile the woman comes up with the Gentleman's food 1st and said my food will be coming shortly.  I did get my food in about 2 minutes.  I begin eating my steak is REALLY RARE! I ask the gentleman next to me and he says he thinks our steaks got mixed up.  I ask for another steak and got it after the gentleman next to me has already left. The steak was thinner than the last one and WELL OVER WELL DONE! Ate half of it and lost my appetite. This was the worst experience I've had here! NO TIP!",

There are signs all over advertising super cheap specials, but those are only available late at night. Pretty much everything is the $10-12 range and there is a $12.99 special for a porterhouse or prime rib. There is also a menu of Chinese food, which seems, um, interesting. I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. The chicken fried steak itself was really tough and the batter was soggy and greasy. I liked the crispy hashbrowns and the generous amount of gravy, though. Service was just okay, pretty much in line with what Raul T. said below.  The highlight of my meal had to be that a table near us had apparently dined and dashed. It was really weird because it was a pretty big group and it looked like a family. Even security guards came to scope out the scene, although I'm not entirely sure what clues they were looking for. Maybe take fingerprints off the cups??",

Full price is still a decent price so that was no problem.   I ordered the steak and eggs and it was just ok.  The steak didn't taste like much I had to add salt which was weird enough because I don't think I ever salt my meat lol. The eggs were good and everyone else enjoyed their meals.  One person got a breakfast burrito and it was huge...better be for $9.99!  Someone else ordered a ham steak and eggs and he said it was delicious.  Really, really weird though, we had two people order steak and eggs the steaks were two very different cuts and the one that was to be well done seemed a lot juicier and tender then the medium rare one.    Service was quick and the staff was decent and somewhat friendly.  IT WAS 4 AM I think I would be annoyed and irritated with just about everyone at that hour.  But I wasn't...I was hungry lol.  Overall ok not too bad for the price.  Will come again because it is 24/7 a bit away from the strip and still good enough to eat when you are hungover or just hungry for breakfast after a long night.  C",

    "text": "This is definitely a spot for locals. Located off the strip, I would say 4 stars only because of the midnight specials. This is the place to go when you want a cheap meal during the late nights or after going crazy around the night life in Vegas. I've been here so many times with different thoughts. I was here last night with a great experience. My waiter was really nice and so outgoing that I knew I was gonna tip him from the start. I love friendly people! But this place has got to be a hit and miss because there have been times where service sucked and the food was off, but a majority of the time it's still worth coming. Tonight was another good experience. Our waiter was nice, straight, and to the point. Got our food fast. No complaints here. I recommend \"steggs,\" the steak and eggs, after midnight. Steak, hash browns, eggs, and toast for $4.95. Not too shabby after spending all you've got on the Strip or somethin. 4/5 for price & quality for what you pay. Open 24 hours. Oh, and I've also had their brownie sundae which was delicious and their cereal, which are both more on the pricey side. But coming here, I'll definitely stick to the late night specials. Always a place I'd recommend!",

I haven't eaten at this place before midnight but from browsing the menu, they have pretty high price points for a cafe. Their after midnight selections, though, are a totally different story. Steak and eggs for under $5, a cheeseburger and fries for under $3, and quite a few other options all under $5. They also offer Chinese food, which I have not tried either but have been told by a friend that the quality is quite tasty.   On each of my visits after midnight, there has always been a line to be seated but never fear, the wait is never long, maybe 5 minutes tops. Once you are seated, the service is not the best but nowhere close to bad. All the employees, especially the ones who first greet you once you are seated, are very friendly and make it an effort to ensure that you are taken care of. I love coming here after a long night of gallivanting or even after catching a late movie 'coz we all know nothing is worst than going to sleep on an upset, growling, stomach!",

The fish looked as though it came from a frozen box container and microwaved to heat it up. Then it was plopped over a bed of french fries. Was not plated well at all. Tarter sauce was served on a seperate plate in plastic cups. The overall menu here looks way over priced for the quality of the food. You would and should expect more!!",

    "text": "This is a great late-night dining place for everyone living on the South side of Vegas. The graveyard specials steal the show. They are served from 12:00 midnight - 6:00 am. One of these graveyard specials is a cheeseburger for crying out loud! Never before have I seen a cheeseburger being served for a graveyard special. Well, I ordered it, and it was great. No complaints. And it's not just boring American cheese; you get to actually choose your cheese.  Outside of their graveyard specials, their Chinese dishes are really good. My dad, who is a former Chinese chef, even commented on how great their Chinese food was. In particular, two dishes stand out. First, their bird's nest dish. It's a bowl made from deep fried noodles and filled with creamy seafood. Perfectly seasoned, and very tasty. The other dish that stands out is their honey walnut shrimp. Crispy fried shrimp coated with a special blend of mayonnaise coupled with honey-glazed walnuts on the outside. It's my personal favorite of the Chinese dishes. Although, make no mistake, these Chinese dishes are very expensive, so only order them if you have a huge budget for dinner, or you're getting free food comps from gambling at the tables.  The service here is also very speedy. I was actually surprised a few times by how quick they were. One time, I was thinking in my mind \"Is this really our order, cause we literally ordered it like 7 mins ago\".",

First the food is overpriced for what you get. I ordered \"scallops in a sechwan sauce\" for $16.99. What I got was a few scallops dredged in heavy flour then lightly deep-fried. Then the scallops were mixed into a sweet/sour(red) sauce (mostly sickly sweet) so the breading got soggy and was peeling off the scallops. Overcooked vegetables were then thrown into the mixture to end up with a bad TV dinner on my plate. My suggestion is that the cafe either get a chef or dump the Chinese food.",

    "text": "WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm a a local and I work in the restaurant industry as well, so I know how service works. I came after watching a movie with my family and since I've only been here once with my husband for a late night dinner, we enjoyed it. As soon as we come in the door the host just points his finger to the host at the end of the restaurant meaning \"go to her she will sit you\" or so I think. We go and the hosts takes us to the booth . As we sat down he took our drink selections right away with a pretty emotionless face no smile no \"hello, how are we today\", nothing. So we did take about 5 minutes to order since it is a rather big menu selection, so we let the server know we still needed a few. more minutes to decide. I guess the server Marlon decided to take quite a long time to come back to us since we ended up waiting about 10-15minutes. When he finally did, we ordered and he acted with a careless attitude and said \"OK\" and left. OK, that's fine I guess. Then the food took quite a  long time, we were planning on leaving since the server was careless and everything seemed to be taking ages to come. But we didn't, we gave it another shot. My mother really didn't like the water soo much so she wanted a raspberry ice-t so when Marlon came walking by we asked him for one. Never came with one so we asked the young lady who refills the drinks to bring us one. She finally did with a smile as well.  Finally when the food came  at last, we eagerly ate with satisfaction that made me a litter happier. So then we don't find the server Marlon for about 20 minutes and my nephew and brother wanted ketchup and soy sauce ,we waited to see if he was ever going to show up again, he didn't,.. what a surprise. So I saw the manager and waved her down to see if SHE can bring the condiments to us she said \"Of course\" with a smile. I thank her for that ! we finally ate in peace and Marlon came at the end of it all and we asked for boxes, he came quickly with those! And we got the check and went to go pay. Thinking that was the worst ever, I was wrong!! The cashier was the rudest. When I asked her politely if she can split the check, she said 'yeah\" with a rude attitude. WHATEVER I thought!! Then as we signed the receipts I thought why tip, but MARLON was lucky to EVEN get a penny FROM ME,  but I gave him a dollar ANYWAYS because his quality of service was just that of a dollar. So as the cashier asked if we wanted our copies we said yes. And she gave me mine, then My mom didn't see her copy so she went back to her to ask for it POLITELY the rude ass lady slammed her hand on the copy and said \"HERE\". I'm sorry but if you don't have time to have a smile and manners to be in the service industry no matter how old you are you should QUIT and go elsewhere. I put up with the rudest people at my job but yet I have respect for anyone who has the decency to smile and act polite!! My family and I didn't deserve such shitty service, no one does! THANKS for nothing!",

In the interest of full disclosure, I have only every been here once that I was not pretty well intoxicated. To my surprise, I enjoyed the food just as much that time as all of the other visits. My favorites on the menu are the steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy ($1.95 for 2 full biscuits smothered in gravy), two egg breakfast, and the cheeseburger isn't bad either.  I understand it's kind of out of the way most of the time, but for a cheap late night drunken breakfast it's the best place to drop my Hamilton.

We waited a while to be acknowledged and seated while half a dozen employees sat at a nearby bar folding napkins.  Our waitress barely spoke English and we had to constantly repeat ourselves.  The child's menu was small and very limited.  We ordered a milk with our son's meal and they charged us $3 for a glass.  $3???  Really????  The food had no flavor.  The portions were okay sized.  The water tasted like dirty city tap water.    While we were eating someone's fish dinner was served.  The smell of the fish was so strong and nasty (and I like fish) I thought one of the elderly women in the both next to us crapped her pants!  Seriously.  My wife is pregnant and her sense of smell is increased right now.  The smell made her sick to her stomach and she couldn't finish her meal.  We won't be back.",

I've eaten there many times over the years and it has gone done hill, way down hill.  There was a time that you could not beat a casino coffee shop for value and quality.  Neither exist here unfortunately.  No excuse for soggy cold food especially when the restaurant is not busy.  Why can't one item be brought out by itself?  Why must it be part of a huge tray?  Where is the food cooked --- Detroit?",

We all ordered from the late night menu, which immediately the waitress asked if we were all 21+. I have never ever been asked this question in the 5+ years I've been coming here, even when I was underage. I'm not retarded, I can read on the menu where it says \"21 and over\" BUT if you are going to have a rule, enforce it from day one..don't pick and choose days where you want to enforce your rules. I asked to speak to a manager on the matter and this new lady who I guess thinks she's the hbic was rude and other words I'll keep to myself. We called to file a formal complaint and the same sad excuse of a manager hung up on us. The food isn't worth ever coming back after being so mistreated. There's a cafe inside of the Orleans with the same price point and much better service.",

One thing we really like here are the midnight specials.  The line was REALLY long, but worth the wait.  We had steak (NY strip) and eggs and hashbrowns and toast for $3.95!  There are other great cheap choices from midnight to like 5 am.  I think it is called the Taxi Cab menu.  Since this is the only restaurant open 24/7, we ate here often.",

Here's Coronado Cafe in South Point Casino that we discovered has the ultimate late night hangover food for as low as $3.95! Served with however you'd like your steak and eggs. They also have hash browns and your choice of white or wheat bread on the side. Don't forget the A1 sauce or you could ask for the 57 sauce. There are also other special orders lower than $3.95. It's not the greatest food, but it will sure fill your stomach after a good one. I would say make it less greasy, but that's where I went wrong. You could let them know how you like everything.   My cousins and I went around 3AM and you'll still find people lining up just for the special till 5AM. They do have a separate menu of orders over $5, but their late night specials are what's great about this place.",

Even though it was such a sad weekend, the Coronado Cafe made our lunch so nice. They accommodated our large party so quickly, the service was so attentive and thorough. The gentleman in charge of our soft drinks and waters was Johnny on the spot. And with every refill came a smile. Our server, Regina was spectacular! She knew the reason for our getting together and she gave extra attention to my Mom. We also had a few allergies at our table and she took them SO SERIOUSLY! That means SO MUCH to me. The manager on duty (Wish I cold remember her name, long brown hair) came over and reiterated their protocol for handling allergies. It let me rest assured that my food would be safe for me and let me concentrate on spending time with my family. It may sound like it should be normal to have an allergy (mine is shellfish) accommodated but trust, me it's not! They even took the time to take a few group pictures of my family. And...oh yeah...the food...it was wonderful. Their hash browns are some of the best in  town! And my Mom tells everyone she knows how amazing the turkey club is! Should not be a novelty but it is REAL turkey, what a concept! haha and as she exclaims, \"they cook the bacon too!\" (Not soggy undercooked chewy straps of leather). So, all in all, we love the Coronado Cafe...from roominess of the dining area, to the service and the food. You can accommodate every taste and every occasion. Thanks so much!",

Chinese food selections and apps such as hot wings are a notch lower in quality but still pretty good. Lots of locals who work swing shift or who are just out partying late also frequent this place. Overall a great place for late night base, can't speak for other times of day but it is almost always busy.",

    "text": "Service * * * * * Food * * * Counter service available  This humble dining room sets the standard for good service. I was awestruck by the great attitude, work ethic, and skill of these amazing servers. How they manage to be cheerful on top of all that work is beyond me. This restaurant must have a world-class manager to assemble such a great team. They've forgotten more about good service than most culinary employees will ever know.  The high point: They clear the used dishes without making a sound! No passive aggressive busboys slamming dishes into a tub.  The servers bus their own tables and they clearly make diner comfort a top priority.   I wish I could say the food was better, but it wasn't bad.  Among three critics, there was one thumbs up and two thumbs sideways.   My Ruben sandwich was pretty good except it was soggy.  I guess they slopped on the sauerkraut without draining it.  When I picked the potato salad I had a hunch it wouldn't be good and I was right. Potato salad seems to be a great challenge for most eateries. (The dab I sampled at Jerry's Famous is an exception.) The pickle was just an ordinary one from the restaurant supply.   Another critic had spaghetti with meat sauce, which he described a pretty bland. It came with garlic toast that was more like French toast, he said.  Our third critic had beef broccoli from the Chinese menu.  She was very happy with it, saying \"The broccoli was just right.\"  I tried a sample but didn't care for it. It wasn't even as good as Panda.  Her vote moved the food rating up to three stars.  Judging by the steady stream of customers (including families with kids), I would say that the food here must be good enough.  It's a spacious, well-lighted restaurant. I guess the new smoking laws make it smoke-free.  Ventilation is good enough that you don't suffer from fumes drifting over from the casino.  I'm not a frequenter of casinos, so I could be wrong, but South Point seemed packed for a Monday evening. Are these neighborhood casinos usually this busy?    South Point offers some very good people watching. The crowd seemed more diverse and interesting. There was a tasteful selection of sizes, shapes, ages, physiques, ethnicities, and stereotypes.  There is quite a racket from the stun tunes and the slots, but it isn't unbearable like Red Rock.",

    "text": "I felt the need to update my review after a friend and I ate here last night.  The service was outstanding! Everyone we encountered from the host, to the server, and even the gentlemen that refilled our drinks was friendly and attentive. My water never reached the bottom of the glass!  We each had the 12.99 Porterhouse Special and, for the price, it was fantastic! It was cooked well and was a generous portion! The plate came with a salad, the steak, 2 large onion rings, and your choice of either a baked potato or mashed potatoes, with a slice of garlic bread. The garlic bread was nothing special, but the rest of the meal was quite tasty!  Even though they were pretty busy, the server still checked on us and our drinks were refilled without even having to say a word. It was fantastic!  It had been 6 months since my previous experience here(which was quite underwhelming), but after last night I will certainly not wait that long to return again!  Bump it up to..  4 stars.",

    "text": "Gotta say I was a regular here maybe once a week for the graveyard specials. Loved this place after a long day and night of working. Today when I went with my cousins ive never seen the worst customer service EVER. My cousin texted his gf when we arrived at 3:11am and it took them long to give our drinks and take our orders. This is where the problem started occuring. Three different groups sat after us and was waiting as well. The couple next to us who sat after us got their food before we even had ours (1st complaint). Then we get our food and my cousin ordered buttered mushrooms on the side, well my other cousin got his steak and eggs did not order mushrooms but the mushrooms that were supposed to be on the side was the ones on his steak. We called the server to notify them what had happened. They took the food and maybe about 8 minutes brang back the same steak and egg plate with a bowl with a small portion of mushroom and my cousin finds a peice of egg and ham inside. Probably the cook just scraped the mushrooms off the steak and put it in a bowl. They then take it back put it on a new plate what do we find an egg. This is where we called the manager. Ive got to say with me myself being a manager in any business if there is a complaint you do your best to handle the situation. The manager on duty at the time had the nerve to say if we were sitting longer than 20 minutes waiting for our food she would have noticed. We tell her we got there at 3:11AM she says no that is not possible let me get the ticket that shows when you folks arrived. She points out you guys ordered at 3:29Am, sooo basically we sat for over 10 minutes before we were even helped. She then has the nerve to tell my cousin well they cook the mushroom on the same stove as the eggs. Like WTH kind of excuse is that. She said she will not charge us for the mushroom and drink from there it was like okay whatevers. I go to order another steak and egg plate medium. This is where I got pissed off. When I get the order about 15 20 minutes later and I go to cut the steak, it is warm and hard to cut. The steak was nowhere near medium in fact it was just rare. I cut it in half to verify it showing blood and strands. I call the manager over and she does apologize but worst thing ive ever had happened in a restaurant was she asked if it was okay if they put the same exact steak I cut back on the grill. NO that is not how you fix a problem with someones food. She then asks if its okay if they make a new one and already fed up with this dinner I just said take it off my bill and im leaving. Now is when we seemed to care that the chef was messing up because before I had the chance to leave she says I will show this to my chef. Like really guys come on no matter how bad of a day you are having you never treat customers like that. For that I will not return to this place for a long while. It may be cheap but for the service I received this last time it is not worth it. Idk whats different from the last months but there is a lot of room for improvement.",

    "text": "We were staying in a nearby RV Resort and wanted to get a casual dinner and the South Point was convenient. We aren't gamblers so usually avoid most of the casinos due to the cigarette smoke. The smoke was pretty heavy at the South Point. The cafe is open on two sides so is a bit noisy and the smoke from the casino area gets in.  Wife ordered off the Chinese menu and really enjoyed her dinner. She said it was one of the best she had in a long time. I ordered spaghetti and it came in a brown very meaty gravy that was great. No red sauce if that matters to you. Dinner salad was crispy and cold with flavorful ranch dressing. The garlic bread that came with the spaghetti was pretty plain but I also got two rolls that came with the salad. Overall a good meal for a casino coffee shop.",

I'm in the hospitality industry and that isn't how that job position works.  Server, Emilia was nice and the manager, Fran was empathic.

    "text": "I used to love coming here. It was literally the spot for late night meals. It was great because they had those midnight specials. However, those under 21 are no longer allowed to order off of there. They can but it would be the regular price of what it is during the day. Even if they were with a person over 21, they'd still have to pay the full price of the meal. I don't know what the real truth behind this new rule is, or how it even started, but not everyone should have to suffer with this. Imagine how much money the cafe would be making by now if they allowed those under 21 to eat with a decent price? Over the summer, the cafe was a big hit and I'm sure they made a lot of money then. Now when you go, it's not as busy as it used to be. They may have peak points but it wasn't like the summer rushes.   The cafe was my favorite steak and eggs place. It was very fulfilling and no other steak and egg late night place can compare to this. Now, with this new rule, some of us have to result in Silverton's \"HEGGS\" place. And it is crap compared to Coronado Cafe, especially their hash browns. (I always looked forward to Coronado's hash browns.) There's not even a steak and egg option on Silverton's menu.",

They took our drink order right away but that's where service kinda ended. We waited another 10-15 minutes just to place our order. Our server kept coming up and saying sorry and she would be right with us. We didn't really understand why it was taking long but we patiently waited until she resolved her issues with another table. In any case, the menu is pretty extensive. They have sandwiches, Mexican food, Chinese food, steaks, kids meals and the whole nine yards. Price point it was priced nicely and they have decent specials.   I ordered the special of the night with was pasta in cream sauce, chicken, and vegetables - the other option was a turkey roast dinner aka thanksgiving dinner, which I should have ordered instead. When it came out it was bow tie pasta mixed with asparagus and some sundried tomatoes. I was hoping to have some other vegetables in it as well but I guess I shouldn't expect much for $9.  In addition, the pasta was a tad over cooked and was bland. The only part that had some flavor was the top portion of the pasta because it was sprinkled with some parmesan cheese.  The chicken was cooked well and there was a lot of it. Overall it was just disappointing because of the lack in flavor. The boyfriend's steak and vegetables looked good and it was their special for $14. It was a good size and they cooked it the way he requested it.    I think if I ordered the right item on the menu I would have had a better dining experience. I would go back if I was around that area of Vegas.",

    "text": "I had a really positive experience here with my fam bam. As a native of Vegas, I've always wanted to experience late night steak and eggs but never got the opportunity to do so until one fateful night in June. I rallied up the troops, some of which were reluctant to get food at 12 am. But who can beat $4.95 N.Y. Steak with two eggs, hash browns, and toast? Graveyard specials like this are what make Vegas so iconic.   It's not easy to serve a large and rowdy party of 7 at 12 am but Sherita did it with humor and finesse. Pretty sure we got some looks from other patrons for being overly giggly, energetic, and waaaay too excited over everything. My brother was trying hard to sweet talk Sherita into letting the under 21 members of our party get the steak and egg special but Sherita held strong and had a good laugh at my bro's feeble attempts to convince her. Food quality exceeded my expectations. To be honest, I wasn't expecting a very flavorful steak given the price tag of our meal, but the steak was seasoned well and cooked to my liking. And nothing beats dipping some sourdough toast into sunny side up egg yolk. Add some crispy hash browns and some ketchup+tapatio and I am one happy camper.  Given our experience, this may become an annual tradition for my family. We can't always be together due to distance, but when we are, it's always a hoot. Coronado Cafe made our time together even more special.",

    "text": "This is a decent place for an off-strip meal if you're not super picky, or if you want a late night meal.  It's open 24/7 which is good.  I mean, this is Vegas after all!    There was a moderate line when I visited on a weekday evening around 6pm.  Waiting time was about 15-20 minutes.  The restaurant is basically just a large, permanently sectioned off area off the lobby rather than a discrete, enclosed restaurant.  This gives it a very open, airy feeling.  But, if you're sitting near the edge you'll basically be right next to people walking through the lobby.  Our server had a very surly demeanor initially (I think she meant this to be part of her charm maybe) though she warmed up a bit as the evening progressed.  They do have a number of very good specials for late night dining (see photo), but we were not there during the wee hours.    We tried the spicy wings to start which were basic but definitely very spicy.  Not bad.  Then I had the schnitzel.  The meat itself was quite good and was juicy with a light and crispy coating, but it was doused in a very heavy sauce which I wasn't expecting based on the description on the menu.  I should've asked for it on the side.  My bad.  For dessert I tried the blueberry pie which was quite good.  Lots of blueberries and a very tasty crust.    So, overall this was a perfectly decent meal with nothing particularly good or bad about it.  If you're hungry at 2:00am as you stroll through Southpoint, though, you might find the Coronado Cafe a welcome respite.",

We're having dinner again here at the Coronado Cafe, and we have Elizabeth: rude yet again!!!  She must have some type of chip on her shoulder towards families, younger patrons, or something else. I can't understand how the South Point management can keep people like her on staff while she treats patrons (and locals like us) so rudely.  Management should be reminded that there are a ton of choices of restaurants within the vicinity of Coronado Cafe and she is a reason why I'm sure they have lost repeat customers and will soon lose us and those that read this review.  The restaurant has good food, but is easily spoiled by this server. Request not to have Elizabeth's section if possible. (Ate here on 9/28 @7:15pm).   From this experience, I would have rather went to the brand new Denny's across the street.",

While he ordered the Porterhouse Steak Medium Rare with Baked Potato ($14.95), I thought maybe I'll try the Vegetarian Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce ($11.25). We started with a nice Garden Salad ($3.95). Our server brought a plate of Fried Crispy Noodles with different sauces. I'm curious if these crispy noodles are meant to serve as a complimentary appetizer, or are they additional toppings for the Garden Salad.   By the time our meal arrived, I took one bite of the Vegetarian Chow Fun and I lost my appetite. I'm not sure if it's the Black Bean Sauce, or if the noodles are lacking flavor. I honestly don't know what it is. Personally, I think the Garden Salad taste way better than the Vegetarian Chow Fun. I ended up having most of my meal packed to-go and figured I try to remedy it at home. No doubt, the service is great but the food I ordered is not up to par with quality of taste. I think it needs adjustment. Maybe next time I'll order something that is more satisfying and close to comfort food.",

Lunch: salads, wraps, burgers, salads, etc & Dinner fare of Meatloaf, Salmon, plus a 12oz Porterhouse Special of 12.95 that includes a baked potato, garlic toast, a couple onion rings.. the whole shabang.   All of these meals are fairly priced, good tasting and a life saver restaurant to go to while staying at South Point because it can fulfill everyone's cravings with all the choices.   They also have a \"Chinese\" section. Looking at the menu even I agree that its very expensive but I have tried some of the Dishes.   -The wonton soup is $6 for a little cup, it was bland and not worth it.  -The Shrimp w/Lobster sauce was $20 but the shrimp were HUGE and it was quite tasty.. but I don't think it's still worth the hefty price tag.  -The Pan Fried Noodles deluxe, however, is my most favorite dish to order off their Chinese Menu. Its under 13 and very delicious.   You MUST try their after midnight menu too for their Steak and eggs for $4.99! The steak's not the finest cut, but c'mon steak and eggs and hashbrowns AND toast for under 5 bucks... c'mon!",

However, we were unable to get the food because we wouldn't make it in time. To be honest, I thought this steak was BS! $4.95? Pfft, can't be True. Thursday November 24th at 1:30am. My opinion has changed on this!!! I ended up ordering two orders for myself. The steak (Medium Rare) was really good! The only problem I had was how long it took for our \"To-Go\" order to come. I understood the kitchen was heavily backed up. At least don't let us wait for an estimate of 17-23 minutes! Everyone was friendly and nice! I would most definitely come back again!",

    "text": "Horrible service tonight by our waiter Todd. Ordered the graveyard special, was told we could only order 1 special per person but when we tried to order the egg special for my 2 year old daughter Todd said it's 1 special per customer. So I asked what age do you need to be to be considered a person? My Girlfriend and I ordered our meals then ordered 1 scrambled egg for the little one. Food came and both steaks were very well done when we asked for medium. I mentioned the mistake on the steaks and again Todd said its only 1 special per person. I asked, so if the food we ordered is done incorrectly we just have to eat it the way it came out and not the way we ordered it? Todd said he would ask. The next time Todd came back to the table ( 12 minutes later ) he put the bill on the table and asked if there was anything else we wanted? I said yes Todd, I want to know if you asked if our incorrectly cooked steaks could be replaced with steaks cooked like we asked. Todd's reply was its Friday night and we're busy. Not only was our food cold, incorrectly cooked but he also charged me for 2 scrambled eggs at $4 not 1 egg that I ordered. The 2 egg special with 2 bacon, hash browns and toast is $2.33. Even the table next to me made a comment about the poor service and there waitress came over and asked if she could help. Maybe Todd was having a bad night but if I ever come back I will make sure I don't have Todd as my waiter, i'll ask first before I'm seated and if I have to wait an extra hour to get a better waiter I'll do so. I try not to complain but when service and food is this bad then I gotta warn others.",

The vegetables were obviously previously frozen as they came out with what looked like freezer burn on them. YUCK!  The biscuit and gravy was so NOT worth it. The gravy was obviously from a can with no flavor what's so ever!  I tell you now I will not be back. I will take the little drive to Silverton for their menu.",

I can purchase everything on their menu (about 5 items) and not hit the $50 mark! The service has always been great. I have never had a even half empty cup, my table has always been cleared immediately if there was an unused and dirty plate. All the staff has been A1 - Seating to Cashier.

    "text": "I understand how some people can give this place three stars, 4 would be over doing it. Food was edible, price is probably what gave the better rating  First of all I was not able to eat here and take advantage of their 12am- 6am dirt cheap food. I really wanted to too! the line was ridiculously long, it was literally down the hall and around the corner! I stood there for about 15 minutes and we never moved, so I decided that my time was costing me money as well.  The next day (Monday, 08/15/2011) we were heading out and decided to stop by for brunch, it was a shorter line this time but it still took about 10 minutes before we were seated.  Once we sat down we waited about 20 minutes before the waitress finally took our order, then it took 50 minutes before we got our food, I know many people like to eat breakfast at lunch time or dinner, but I think we should be allowed to make that choice not have it forced upon you. I ordered breakfast and didn't get it 'til lunch!  The pancakes had a hint of fish flavor to it, the fries were rubbery, the Chicken wrap was over salted. A friend of mine got a bagel, fruit cup & Coffee had to pay more than the person who got pancakes, eggs, bacon & Mimosa, how does that make any sense? I personally got the two eggs, hash brown, country fried steak with a side of corned beef hash with glass of water and only had to pay $2 more. Someone needs to redo their menu pricing!!!  We were not the only one who had a problem with the slow service because the table around us all had the same problem and people were getting up left and right looking for some explanation on why our waitress disappeared and that no food was coming out. After it finally came out, the waitress explained to us that the hostess sat us wrong and instead of distributing/spreading new customers  across the room, they sat us all down one after the other making it hard to get all our orders in and getting them out at the same time.   Although I understand her frustration, I've seen many wait staff handle a lot more than this and have done it well. Naturally we (all the tables affected) asked to speak with the manager abut the situation. The manager we spoke to (forgot to look at her name tag) was a skinny young Black woman, mid 20's, early 30's. She seemed way to young and soft spoken to be a manager which explains her stupidity. She just apologized to use and instead of blaming the operation failure, she blamed it on the waitress. Then attempted to walk away. One of us asked if our bill would be reduced because how the ridiculous wait time, it took her by surprise and she said she would.   When the adjusted check came (we were paying separately) this is what the manager took off of the bill, ONE COFFEE, ONE MIMOSA. are you freaken kidding me?????, if you know that we all had separate bills, we ALL had to wait over an hour, EACH one of us should have something written off!  My advise to you if you come here, ask for someone, anyone to check on your order every 5 minutes, you never know if you are gonna have this situation!",

I also lived 35 years in the NYC/NJ area, and spent a month in China, so I know what good Chinese food tastes like). The Wor Wonton soup is also excellent. As far as the non-Chinese items on the menu (prime rib, eggs, burgers, sandwiches, etc...), all of these items are typical quality of what you would find at any Vegas cafe....nothing great, but decent at a fair price. But my advice would be to just stick with the Chinese food.",

You might expect a pretty gnarly steak for the price, but nope - it's a lean, tasty, nicely charred filet (I like it medium rare; outside is charred, inside is usually the proper reddish-pink) that IMVHO is better quality than the $14.95 porterhouse. The rest - two eggs, hash browns, toast - is cooked to taste. Eggs have great buttery flavor. South Point is always a better value in every way than anything on the main Strip, and the cafe is no exception.",

Complimentary very crispy hard noodles came with Sweet & Sour Sauce, Plum Sauce, and Mustard Sauce, and I received Chili Oil and Hoisin Sauce on request to supplement Red Vinegar and Soy Sauce for the faifly big Pan-Fried Pork Potstickers that tasted homemade rather than frozen.  Crunchy Chicken & Vegetable Spring Rolls and lightly battered Shrimp Tempura rounded out our starters.  Unfortunately no ginger or Tempura Sauce were available.  They would have been nice to have but were not essential to enjoying the potstickers or Shrimp Tempura.    Wor Won Ton Soup was as large as before, with lean pork, medium-sized pork-filled wontons, shrimp, white-meat chicken, bok choy, Green Onion, thin lo mein noodles, and tasty broth.  Booth seating was comfortable in a brightly lit, casual setting with piped in easy listening pop music.  Service by our server and assistant server was excellent.  And, all was washed down with cups of pleasant hot Grand Tea Co. Golden Flower Tea.   An excellent off-strip Cantonese cuisine alternative!",

    "text": "Date of visit 9/2/2019: On this quiet Labor Day, my boyfriend and I saw a movie at Southpoint and then had lunch at Coronado Cafe on the first floor. I've been meaning to write a review because I've done this dozens of times now. I sometimes have group outings with friends to the movies and then we head for Coronado Cafe because they are very accommodating for a spontaneous large group.   This cafe is essentially a diner and is one of my favorites because it's spacious and I like the open feel where you can see the casino. Being from New York City originally and having frequented diners there, I'm always looking to check out any sort of diner-ish eating establishment. The menu has a large selection with a variety of foods.They have appetizers, breakfast food anytime, sandwiches, salads, entrees, desserts and they even have a separate Chinese food menu. They have daily entree specials for $8.95. They have a prime rib or steak special for $14.95. Most of the prices are fairly reasonable but a few of the dinner entree items are a bit pricier than some of the other cafe/diner restaurants at the other casinos.  The service is usually reasonably good. They are polite and try to do their best. For a larger group the server will mark the different orders and they let you pay separately at the cashier's station.  I would say that Coronado Cafe is a good place to go for a casual meal with a group of friends because there's something on the menu for everyone!",

I've sold this place to a million people and have enjoyed many steaks.. hundreds.. here is the problem. The last year or more everyone I've gone it's been worse and worse. I cut back on my visits, tried rotating the nights I went to see if the cooks would be better and nothing.. it just sucks and sucks more. For the price; still not worth it. It was, but now It sucks. Gross eggs that are like water and soaked, burnt hash-browns that are  soggy in the middle, a thin steak that's like a sole of a shoe.   Only the biscuits stayed good and .. now they are okay but the service sucks. I'm so sad. I'm here right now.. gonna cry",

    "text": "It's off the strip and Located inside Southpoint Hotel &  Casino. I only came here for their graveyard specials (12am-6am)-- steak and eggs for $4.95. Despite of price being $5 under, food was yummy and cheap. I always requested my eggs to be sunny side up and well done (yolks should not be runny), sometimes they can make it right or not. It's a 50/50. The only issue is Line can be really long to get in, but it's worth it.  Sometimes we ate dinner here since my Aunt got discounts/coupons from playing in the casino. They have wide selections in the menu. American, Asian, Mexican cuisine. Marlon from Philippines (our server that New Years Day) was very nice and good at making recommendations. Service was good and Food was delicious. General TSO's Chicken... yum!!",

    "text": "A Truly Big Disappointment  In late July 2019, my wife and I had the opportunity to patronize this place twice in two days.  On our first visit here (and to the South Point Casino Hotel that houses this restaurant), I had the porterhouse special for $14.99.  The wife had the Coronado omelet.  Our friend also had the porterhouse special.  Since this was the first time in 5 days that we were having something more 'American' than the usual Filipino fare that we've had in the past days of our week-long visit, I was excited.  For one, the price was excellent for a 16 oz. steak.  For another reason, the place was relatively elegant.  The steak came in very dry, even for medium (for me) and medium-well (for our friend) orders.  Mine was rubbery, tough and a bit cold.  Our friend complained that hers was tasteless.  My wife's omelet, which she ordered with ham, had lots and lots of potatoes but she had to pick through the omelet to find the ham.  One bright thing about our experience were the wait staff and bussers.  Maria (Hispanic lady with a son named Gonzalo) was very friendly, and Gonzalo, who served our drinks, was very attentive.  I only have great positive things to say for both of them.  I wish I could say the same for the food.  On our next visit, which was next day, we came with my wife's high school classmate and this time she did the ordering.  She ordered a Chinese soup with crabs, shrimps and scallops and a dish and a main dish with only vegetables (bok choy, mushrooms, asparagus, etc).  It was okay.  I thought it was a very poor attempt to imitate Chinese cooking.  Again, the service (Filipino, I didn't get his name, and once again Gonzalo) was very good.  Can't complain.  I will submit photos at a later time.",

    "text": "This review is based purely on the graveyard specials.  We had the pancake sandwich and New York steak and eggs.  It was 3.95 and 4.95 respectively.  While the flavor wasn't amazing, for the price, it can't be beat.  It's only available from midnight to 6am.  The steak would normally be a solid and tasty 3 but the price pulls a star.  My only gripes are the ham with pancake sandwich is pretty terrible.  It's salty and thin.  It tastes dry.  The pancakes were awesome.  The had some crunch and fluffiness.  Some of the best pancakes I've had.  The scrambled eggs were perfect.  It's so easy to overlook them.   The hash browns and steak were pretty average.  I will be back!!!",

    "text": "All of a sudden got my coffee and I seek eggs and bacon! I'm here at South Point and trying to figure out where I can locate some! That's not buffet style.  Search over the Coronado Cafe has me covered, yes! Now I can indulge!  Headed over to the Cafe that is located to the right of the Cage in the South Point Hotel. Inside of the restaurant one passes through an arch that is square to be taken to your table by the wonderful hostess. I was seated at a booth which is the best seating I believe in the restaurant. The menu was laid on the table and now it's time to find some food. Surprisingly the menu here is full of all kinds of wonderful and delicious options.   After ordering I was checking out the decor of the restaurant and to my surprise discovered that there are huge picture windows that are watching me it seems! Could be some room 101 people maybe? Remember 2 + 2 = 5! Perhaps, it is Vegas! So if you constantly need to know if your hair is in place or you have that perfect selfie image ready this will be welcoming for you! The mirrors are not bothering me but my minds wanders to why they are there. Are they for decoration or for watching?   Off the government is out to get us for a moment, and onto what I ordered. Now on my second Mimosa I am feeling that extra alcohol in this drink! I ordered the bacon and eggs special. It is any two eggs cooked your way with toast and hash-browns. The toast choices here are very diverse because they actually had rye bread. The eggs I ordered were sunny side up. They were cooked very well. The bacon was not freeze dried, it was real bacon and tasted amazing. The hash browns were a little under cooked but I'm not a huge fan of them. Over all the breakfast was a success!  The staff here are so friendly and helpful. They come around and fill the water glasses before you even know that you need more! The service that they do provide is genuine and honest too. The servers come around and ask if there is anything else you need, such service and with big smiles. The hostess was friendly as well! The cooks are fast at getting the food out to the hungry customers. After I placed my order it was in front of me in no time.  The best time to visit this cafe is at midnight where you can eat and be full for about $5.00! Wow and the food is actually good and will not kill you! For example a steak and eggs spread cost $4.95 after midnight, but during the day it's the daily special for $14.95. If you cannot make it in during the wee hours of the morning then the prices of their food are extremely reasonable. Come and check it out. There drink specials are amazing too my mimosas were only a $1.00. What a great price? The mimosas get stronger the more you order. Cheers to that!  Now you know where to get fantastic breakfast in South Point hotel. The drinks here are great and get stronger as you go along. What ever your poison they can get you tipsy? The best time to visit is after midnight for killer food discounts and drink specials. You cannot take the food home so come hungry. The dog will not get left overs from here since you cannot take them home! Oh well but for the amazing price and quality of the food it rocks!",

    "text": "We have eaten here before but this was before I had a Yelp account!  Today we were dicing with our friend Polly.  The die ordered me to get fish and chips, It sucks because I just gave up fish and said I would not eat it again so I decided to take 1 bite which is the rule and that would be that, give the rest to Polly.    She was forced to order the Jackpot burger and Don had to get a chicken wrap.     The die was mean to us today though Polly and Don loved their food so it wasnt all bad.    Here is the problem.  I ordered chili....delicious and then with my fish comes salad or soup, I asked what kind of soup and was told-Chicken noodle (Um no) or Veggie, I asked if the Veggie had mushrooms because I do not like those.., the man said he didnt know and would check, he comes back 20 mins later and says that he doesnt know, the chef cant confirm either way...I said ok, no worries, I will just take another chili and pay the difference, He said he didnt know if that was allowed....I said, well I have done that before and there was not a problem, he said he would check....ok 10 mins later I have my new smaller bowl of chili.... because I am only allowed to have the size bowl that soup comes in even though I was more than willing to pay the extra charge but ok...no big deal....but it didnt end here.  We ordered dinner at 3:30PM and at 4:30 PM had to call the manager over and ask where our food was, she said that because I have an allergy, the fish and chips had to be cooked separately and that takes an hour?      We explained that I just didnt want mushrooms, Don ordered the chili as well and didnt want onions, I didnt want cheese on mine....There was no mention of an allergy at all....  She apologized and got our food out straight away...  I took my one bite and gave the rest to Polly, we are eating and the waitress who has now switched places with the original waiter brings us the bill and thanks us for coming in....UM...we are still eating, like we JUST started and we wanted dessert....  We explained to her that there was never an allergy and she said ohhhh...he must have misunderstood...No worries...we said...  So, Don finishes his drink and nothing, no one comes over to see how our meal is, probably because we have the bill and they want us to leave but we said to another waiter that we needed another refill (Our second) and we wanted dessert...  The waitress comes back over and asks what we want, Polly orders a carrot cake, I order coconut cream pie and Don orders Blueberry pie w/Ice cream.  About 15 mins later she comes over with their desserts and says thank you...Don speaks up and asks where my coconut cream pie is?  she says, You want coconut cream pie Now?    I said, well, No, I ordered it already but yes, I want it now...she changes the bill in a huff and says--what about your allergy?        What allergy?      I said, and what does coconut cream pie have to do with mushrooms in the first place?     Everyone was confused because it doesnt connect to us and she changed the order (The bill that was once again on the table) and walked off, 10 mins later I got my pie and I bagged it and left.  We left a $10 tip, more than I wanted to leave but Don insisted that a tip had to be left, it wasnt because we were happy, NOT AT ALL.   It was because a tip must be left according to Casino worker Don.",

    "text": "Stopped off at South Point for dinner after a show at Buffalo Bill's in Primm. Walking into the bright, airy, and pretty casino was a welcome relief after the dreary atmosphere at Bill's.  Our inclination was to go to the Mexican restaurant, but it was about to close, so we went to Coronado. It took us a long time to go through the huge menu, but there was ample choice for the four of us. The 18-year-old ordered - what else? - the Coronado Burger with fries. Her mom surprised me by skipping the Chinese menu (she's visiting from China and eats - and cooks - Chinese food almost exclusively) and choosing the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce dinner, my husband had a South of the Border Omelet, and I picked the Vegetable Frittata.   I was thrilled to be able to substitute broccoli for the hash browns, and it was a great choice - huge portion of fresh broccoli, and perfectly cooked with garlic. My omelet had almost too much provolone cheese, if there is such a thing, and was enough to take home a whole breakfast for the next day.  All the portions were very big; the mom's dinner came with a cup of delicious bean and veggie soup, which I tasted. The teen also ordered French Onion soup, because her American friends have extolled its virtues, and she was in soup heaven. Our waitress was excellent and very professional.  By the time we left, shortly after midnight, the cafe started filling up; that's when the midnight specials kick in. Shucks, we could have filled up for a lot less money! But if we're in the neighborhood, we'd choose Coronado again even at the higher prices, which are very moderate.",

In addition to this, while ordering the dish it displayed an option for substitution, however, the server did not acknowledge it even though I pointed it out.  When I received my dish, I didn't receive the rest of the items that it said it came with (bread and hash browns). I was already upset at this point where I didn't say anything.   I was planning on buying dessert, but without asking if there was anything else we needed we were given a check. The waiter did not check on us at all, or refill our drinks. I waited for a while because I wanted Cholula for my eggs and chili relleno, and my boyfriend wanted ketchup.  We weren't acknowledged even though the waiter came by to other tables. So I had to go to another empty table that had those sauces and take those condiments.   Really poor customer service overall.  Food wasn't bad at all, they did offer lunch specials but I do not think I will be coming back.",

But luckily for me I was staying at the South Point Resort and in the casino level this diner offering the greatest deals if you dine in from 12midnight until 6am. I saw a lot of people eating the 4.95 steak and eggs special but I was feeling the 3.95 sausage link eggs and hash brown and the 2.95 biscuits and gravy. You can't go wrong for under 7 bucks what I got , satisfied my hunger and sent me back to my room ready to sleep off the alcohol and start fresh tomorrow !",

Well, yesterday I forgot my casino card (that gives you a discount)  and the buffet brunch was $2 more at  $18.95. I wasn't THAT hungry.  I always saw a steady flow of customers at the Coronando Cafe so I decided to try it out.  I like the openness in terms of space and seating.  When it gets busy the staff do check on you but the pleasantries go out the door and they are direct. You need this or that? No? Moving on.  Which I don't mind if you are busy.  Now, for the food. I had the Southpoint Special. It's a layered mix of eggs, melted cheese, potatoes, red and green peppers, onions, and your choice of bacon, ham, or sausage.  I ordered it with corned beef hash on the side and wheat toast.  I was expecting small portions but it was pretty big and I couldn't finish it all.  It was delicious!  I think it was the complementary cinnamon coffee cake that started to fill my stomach. Overall I'm satisfied with my experience and will not overlook this little gem again.",

You know a place is doing something right when it is packed and you have to wait for a table at 3am.   From midnight to 6 am, Coronado Cafe has graveyard specials that include $2.45 for 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and bacon or sausage. They also have 7 oz NY steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast for $3.95!!!  Need I say more? If I wasn't still full from dinner and thinking about crawling into bed soon after eating, I would've gone for the steak and eggs.",

The waiter delivered our food and never returned to give us refills or ask if we needed anything. The biscuits and sausage gravy were horrible. The biscuits might as well be hockey pucks. I could barely get the fork in the biscuit to cut it in half.  And then when it was time to go and my friend wanted to box the rest of his meal up, we had to find a bus boy to bring a box.  Unfortunately, all the bus boy did was tell our waiter we needed a box. The waiter carried the to-go box  to us and handed it to my friend without ever looking at him and then he walked away. It was the worst service I have ever had and will probably not go back even though I absolutely love the gravy to the biscuits and gravy.",

Usually there's a small line when it starts to get past midnight, but it's never very long.  When you sit down, they give you a menu with lots of options, but the one you want is the one in the little standee on the table.  In addition to $4 steak and eggs, they also have $1-$3 breakfasts, which is as good a deal as you could ask for.  The servers are actually quite friendly for graveyard shifters, and are entirely accommodating.  Incidentally, they have a good selection of Asian food on the menu, though the prices on those are a bit more normal (think $5 to $8).  I've had the pad thai, not bad for a casino cafe!

The Sweet & Sour Pork was way too sweet so we had to return it.  The Buddha Feast was not: it was a lot of non-Asian vegs of the rooty variety (carrots, brocolli, asparagus) instead of the tastier cruciferous Asian vegs such as bean sprouts, snow peas, onions, bell peppers, nappa cabbage, mustard greens, etc. Already sent a complaint to the buffet manager months ago about their bad service, but got no response so I don't expect to get 1 here either so I'm leaving my review here instead.

He's tall, stocky etc.  I playfully say to the hubby that guy looks like Suge Knight and he says that is him.  So weird, I wanted to ask him if he had anything to do with Tupac and/or Biggies deaths, too surreal.  Only in Vegas I suppose. So the service here was awful, I do not believe I have never not left a tip before.  First the waitress, an older Asian lady came and asked us, 'what u want,' then we proceeded to wait and wait for our buffalo wings, we had no drinks, no napkins and when we asked for dressing she came and threw the dish on the table.  I was just shocked because she was do bad, she was obsessing over her big table and could care less of the rest.   I've been here many times and think they have the best buffalo sauce ever, I only wish they fried them naked.  They also have really good late night specials for really cheap from midnight to 6am.

Stopped in here after seeing the pictures which looked great, BUT all those specials are only for a super late night special only.   In fact, they didn't even sell those during regular hours, which is odd.  Ok, so you have Chinese food, which is about $10-13 for lunch, and the pad thai was garbage btw.   I could see how the average white person would never notice the low quality, but it will not slip past me.   Three of us ate here, we all agree after spending $50 total it was a complete waste.

I'll get straight to the point, the waiter/waitress service here is TERRIBLE! My boyfriend and I saw our waitress a grand total of 3 times during our entire dining experience there. When she initially approached us to take our orders, she was giving us attitude and actively rolling her eyes at us while we ordered. I can understand if you're having a bad day, but why take it out on customers (who will give you the opportunity to make some extra cash through tips)? After she dropped off our food, she returned shortly after to hand us the bill and left. Luckily the restaurant's busboy was there to help take care of us. He was actually the one that brought us our drinks and checked up on us periodically if we needed refills or anything else. We ended up giving him a tip instead of our waitress, for obvious reasons.  For $3.95 (or $4.95 for the steak breakfast) they do give you a good amount of food. I was honestly anticipating smaller portions since the price was so cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised. As for the taste factor, the food was fairly average to me. My fries were cold and limp and my cheeseburger was very bland. I didn't have any of my boyfriend's steak breakfast, but he said his was pretty good.  Overall, the food here is average and the service is horrible. I'm sure other waiters and waitress that work here aren't terrible as the one we had, but lucky for us we got the queen of terrible. Honestly, this is the perfect place to go to when you are drunk and want something cheap to eat ('cuz let's face it, everything tastes better when you're drunk). 2 out of 5 stars.",

They do have some really good specials especially for late night ,  The wait we have found to be long at times and service can be a bit slow at times but of course it is always depending on how busy they are,  We have always ordered breakfast and we have never had a problem. The food is not too bad,  The prices are pretty cheap so if your here or close by and need some cheap eats this is the place to go, It is always clean and that's a big plus!",

My wife ordered salmon and a baked potato. I ordered steak medium well with a baked  potato. My steak was tough and dry and both baked potatoes were very dry. I asked our  server if I could get a bottle of ketchup and he said that he was going on break and that this  other server would get it for me.  I waited and waited no ketchup so I saw a bottle of  ketchup on another table so I retrieved it off the table.  The servers were just standing  around and talking none of them were paying too much attention to the customers.  My wife and I are locals and we frequent south point about three or four times a week.  We will never dine again at the Coronado Cafe again.  We have eaten there many times before and everything was satisfactory!  A dissatisfied customer!!!  Mike C. Sr.",

My husband's hamburger was juicy, the lettuce was crisp, the tomato was thickly sliced and the onion was freshly sliced (yes, I can tell!), the bun was lightly toasted and soft on the inside!

It's immersed and dripping with oil (I ordered an omelet), the flavor is akin to something from a can or powder, the water tastes like salt water, the tables are very small and have little room for eating. My wife and I had to wait nearly 30 mins (even after the food arrived) for a booster seat for our daughter and we asked for one right when we got to our table and even when we ordered our food. Staff walk around shouting to patrons \"I'll be right with you in just a minute\" and having them wait nearly 10 mins after that for the waiter to ask what you'd like to drink. We had a horrible waitress and had to basically rely on the table bust boy to get anything done. The aroma is very strong of the smell of a portable bathroom. There's no smoking obviously but that doesn't matter because the slots are right next to the restaurant and smoke billows right into the eating area. They say their soup is home made but it is very obvious it is right out of a can. All around a very unpleasant experience here. Only one star for the cleanliness of the place.",

    "text": "This cafe is most known for their graveyard midnight specials. Ever since the ol gold coast closing their cafe down, and Orlean's stopped having a good deal, this is the place to go for their $3.95 Steak n Egg's deal !   Sometimes they are super busy, resulting in a long wait line. Sometimes you walk straight in. Depends on if there are any events or holidays or even weekends. I even had one experience where we came here late at night/early in the morning around 4-5am, on a memorial day weekend, and they ran out of steaks !   Due to their huge popularity of their midnight menu, their consistency ranges widely. If theres a lot of people, you have a fairly low chance in getting the correct cook temp on your steak. Being a guy who loves his medium rare steaks, you can't cook it for too long otherwise you'd go into the medium to medium well territory fairly easily. Huge cafe, tons of people, im pretty sure they don't have that many cooks doing the orders. Not easy to keep an eye on every single steak and pay attention to how through it has been cooked.   Aside from the 3.95 steak n eggs, there's also other items on the menu like biscuits & gravy, ham steak & eggs, eggs & bacon/sausage, for different prices (lower than steak n eggs i believe)   Steak & Eggs - $3.95 - 6 - 8oz ny strip with 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast.   Meat quality isnt the greatest. Definitely you get for what you pay but at 12am, there's almost no other deal that you can get.   As i had said before, i like my steaks medium rare, but also don't mind it being less than medium rare. So as one of my friends has taught me, i order RARE. Rare typically is a heat kissed steak with a cold, red center. Once in a while, i do get that, but usually the \"rare\" will end up in medium rare (pink, warm center) to medium (minimal pink) territory.   Aside from the steak, i order over-easy eggs and toast. Egg's are usually pretty spot on, in terms of cook, which is a good thing. I love a nice rich runny yolk with my toast.   Service wise, you'll have two people. One who takes your order, brings your food, and your receipt to take up to pay, then never see again.... Then the other, who does your drink orders and refills. You'll see the drink guy much more often than the actual waiter/waitress.   Overall, great place to get a midnight meal.   Note: you aren't limited to 1 order per person. if you ARE definitely hungry, you can order two and share or just eat both your self :P om nom nom !",

With that being said, she messed up 2 of the 7 meals + one bakery Danish was old and hard as a rock. We hardly saw our waitress, had to waive down other servers for napkins/utensils + refills.",

My parents love the Chinese food here and we were feeling a little sick so we decided to try a bowl of Wonton Soup, Egg Rolls, and a side salad. -Wonton Soup : I liked it-it wasn't the best or the worst- the broth-   thank goodness- had taste and the wontons were big. For the price though, I thought the bowl should've been bigger. I was surprised because most everything here is cheap but not the Chinese food!!! -Egg Rolls : I hate when places just cut the eggroll in two and then consider it 2 pieces when it's actually 1 damn piece, Gosh.... Anyways, they do this here- the taste was just like the soup-not the best or the worst... Side Salad : Typical They give you fried chow mein noodles with various dipping sauces for free.... **Warning** these fried chow mein noodles may chip your tooth-Hopfully, I just got a fried to long yucky order of it. Would I come back?   Not if I was paying, that's for sure...",

When you need something greasy and carbohydrate laden to sink to the bottom of your stomach and prevent you from vomiting come here.   After midnight, a visit to this restaurant is easy on the pocket book. There is usually a short line, but the hosts(esses) are prompt in seating you. The wait staff look as if they are less than satisfied with having to deal with the locals, but I cannot hold it against them.   The food here comes out quick and accurate. I love the steak and eggs special. It comes with a nice cut of meat, two eggs any style, a heaping serving of hash browns, and a tower of your choice of toast. For less than five dollars this meal is a steal. That being the most expensive of the specials is a great sign of how cheap the other four specials are.",

NY steak with hash browns and eggs and burger with fries for about $3.75, but the customer service we had was garbage. Although the line was about a 10-15 minute wait we were seated immediately. It was pretty busy, but what made very frustrated was we waited about a good 15 minutes for our server to take orders while other parties after us got their food and drinks within the first few minutes they sat down. To add on top of that, while the other parties after us got their food quickly we waited more than 30 minutes for our New York Steak. Take note that those other parties that came after us had about two-eight people, and they got their food within 15-20 minutes. Wow! When we finally got our food our server tried being extra nice and constantly checked up on us, but that sugar coating didn't fly with me, and the funny thing is our check came a lot faster than our food did. Food was okay, but I didn't like how our server kept us waiting while the other servers brought out their parties' food more quickly and efficiently.",

I mean, nothing special or anything, they have to serve sooo many people but it's not like they are over extending the staff or anything.   It's run pretty well!  The menu is super split.

Twice my bf got the South Point Special (it was called something like that.. with eggs, potatoes, cheese, and ham or bacon) -- I ordered it one of the times too -- it was good.. and A LOT of food (mostly potatoes). I think I only finished half of mine.  Their coffee is perhaps better than I expected from a diner in a casino. We had many cups.   They have separate beverage servers because of how high volume they are - there's often a line during the breakfast/lunch times. Service was pretty quick, considering every table was full every time we went.",

For some time the restaurant has been promoting its $12.95 prime rib dinner as a \"House Special\".  This was hands down the WORST prime rib I have ever had. We came here on the recommendation of Anthony Curtis' Las Vegas Advisor website where it was described as a \"the big slab prime rib\". That was hardly a fitting description. The slice of prime rib I received was cut in a wedge shape. The wide edge was about  1/2\" thick and the opposite edge tapered down to zero. Nearly half of that was fat and gristle. What remained was simply flavorless. It came with a baked potato which was served lukewarm. The salad and rolls were okay but rather ordinary. Service was slow and we waited a very long time just to get menus before we could even order.",

I shared the 7 oz. steak with hash browns, eggs, and toast with my boyfriend because I wasn't too hungry. The steak was OK at best - it was well done on one half and medium on the other, we asked for medium- but who's complaining for under $4? Hash browns weren't really crispy but the toast was good and the eggs were all right. Overall everything was lacking in salt; understandable given the older crowd. OK place if you're drunk or don't feel like going out to the strip but definitely not a destination eatery.",

My $7.95 flat iron steak with blue cheese crumble was as flavorless as it gets. There were only a few little chunks of blue cheese. The mashed potatoes were as plain as they comes. To top t all off, it came with a scoop of peas. What is this, a school cafeteria? I've had worse meals but this ranks right up there. My wife had a Ruben. I've seen 5 year olds make better looking sandwiches. The corned beef was dry and boring and the bread was a joke. The potato salad was crusty, like it had been sitting around all day.  I read many reviews about how great the midnight specials are, apparently that is the only time they care about their customers. When the waitress asked how our meal was, I replied that the food was bland and tasteless. She replied with, \"sorry about that\" and walked away. She came back with the check about 20 minutes later.  Who cares about customer service when you have this many thousands of customers each day.  Do yourself a favor, stick to the local restaurants and avoid the common casino cafes. This one is at the top of my list of the worst casino cafes in Las Vegas.",

I personally like my food to be hot...so I know that it was just freshly cooked and not hanging around the back!  But that's just me.    The only redeeming thing about this place was their prices.  They weren't very expensive so that was good.  I guess if you are at the South Point late at night with no other options than this place will work...other than that I will find somewhere else to go.",

It does kind of sucks that I have to repeat my order 3-4 times till she finally got it.  I didn't want to sound like I was yelling, but it almost got to the point of raising my voice for her to hear my order.  At least they were good on refills.    After getting our food, I had the steak and eggs.  The eggs and hash brown was okay.  The steak on the other hand, was a tad bit chewy for a medium.  It was edible, but a bit unsatisfying.  Kind of felt like I was biting into a tire.    Overall, it may be a nice place, and it might be good for breakfast, but probably don't consider the steak for breakfast.",

I wanted to biscuits and gravy for $2.95, great deal and good meal. But recently I've been having trouble with my card, so I went to the front desk to try and pay first, in order to make sure that the meal was paid for in full. But they wouldn't allow me to? What?! Who turns down money? \"um excuse me, may I give you MONEY for foo?\" ... \"no sorry, we don't do that hear\"  okay... So I'll just go eat as you insist and then, hope that the money goes through. Wait a moment, eureka! greatest place on earth. They don't want your money, only want to give you food. Sweet! So I ordered my water and my biscuits and yes the biscuits were so good, I literally licked the plate and for $2.95, steal.  But then just like I predicted, when I brought up the check to pay the bill, the card wouldn't go through. So they called over the manager Jessica. What a good smile. What good service. She took the time to listen to both sides of the issue and then after ruled that it was not worth fighting over and comped the breakfast and then sent me away with a smiley warning.   Ps-I went back for breakfast this morning, scrambled eggs with lox, sourdough toast and hash browns. The eggs were bland the hash browns were under cooked but the sourdough was sweet as can be. And for the record, when serving tea, the water shouldn't be scalding hot. I want to drink it, not take the paint off my car.",

    "text": "If I learn something in vegas is that the places to find chinese food that taste just like the one in New York is hotel cafes. This little places have such a variety but most of the ones ive been at, their Chinese food can reach epic proportions.  The cafe itself has what I call \"cafe service\". This means that the servers might ignore you, they might take forever to bring your food but your busser will be on top of everything making you wonder \"why the hell am I tipping the server for\" . Its pretty universal throuout the cafes , so I learnt to live with it and not get mad. It also includes an ok level on cleanliness . sometimes there is a mountain of plates right next to your other times its pristine  But the lines...ay dios mio!. The waiting line can be horrendous.When I see this line I seriously wonder if Depeche mode is signing authographs inside. By default the southpoint is always packed..and most of its clientel are cafe people (specially after all the restaurants close) so this can make your eating experience a little miserable. I stay away from it on the weekends because of this. If you are ok with lines, be my guest; but don't complain as you've been warned  Food..YUM! when I go I get two menus. The regular one and then the Chinese menu..everytime I open that menu little querubins come down and start singing in my ears. Yes its paradise.  I can tell by own experience . EVERYTHING on the Chinese menu is great. Yes everything .Ive tried it all so pick your favorite dish and love it. Specially if you like Ney York style kinda Chinese food.DONT expect the Chinese experience, but more of the east coast Chinese one  Lets don't assume that the other menu is bad. The portions and the choices are great. I am always pleased with the orders and most of the times are cooked right. You can get from breakfast to a full dinner here . Everything is \"cafe\" quality so don't expect a Joel robuchon meal when you are clearly not there nor paying the price tag .  Now, time to go to their sportsbook and make a quick pit stop at the cafe.. Lets hope there is no line!",

FOOD Our steak was dry and was begging to drown in BBQ sauce (luckily provided by our server) while the eggs were simple and just boasted their own egg-y flavor. My own burger and fries weren't time-stopping, but at least they weren't barf-inducing (plus came with fairly crisp lettuce and tomato). It was a welcome salty and hot food to my tired self.  SERVICE The staff was continually running around and took our orders, delivered our food, and gave refills all in a timely manner. Very business-like yet friendly--even in the wee AM hours.",

Just giving it 3 stars because the service is mediocre, sometimes you have to stand up and get help, don't forget you are still near the casino where you could possibly still inhale the smoke, and if you are like me, come here for their graveyard specials, expect a long line.    Its been a while since I've had the late night munchies, and they have really expanded on their menu, so that's a plus.  I had a Short Rib Omelette, and it was nothing spectacular, so next time, I will stay with the breakfast deals.  I always try to order something new to taste, but I think for this particular cafe, I'll stick with the breakfast.",

The staff was really nice and always made sure we had everything we needed. I ordered the Pancake sandwich (Buttermilk pancake, ham steak and egg). Well I got 2 pancakes, 1 fried egg and ham lunchmeat heated up!! So that is not a Ham Steak!! But it was only $3.75 I believe. It tasted ok. My husband ordered the 7oz NY steak, eggs, hash browns and toast for $3.95. He ordered his steak medium and it was well done. So he said it was tough to chew otherwise it was ok. This cafe is open 24/7. I do say at least the staff was very nice and the place was clean. We will go back but, when and time frame who knows :)",

    "text": "How this place ever got more than three stars is beyond belief. It honestly makes me question half of the reviews on yelp as this place has the worst service I have EVER had anywhere in my LIFE. At my three day stay at the South Point Hotel (which is actually pretty decent), I unfortunately ate here three times.   During all three times, I boxed  my food at the end of the meal to be eaten later but not once did I ever receive any utensils to use. Do I really need to ask for plastic to-go utensils when eating pasta, rice, or a steak? I think so.  Food here is AVERAGE at best but service here is honestly HORRIBLE. On the last night when my friends and I came back from EDC on Sunday at 5 AM, it honestly look the waitress 10 minutes just to get water to our table and then another 10 minutes to get our order. I asked MULTIPLE staff members as well as managers to send our waitress to us and yet we still waited. There were numerous amounts of other members on staff that could have taken my order but they wanted me to wait for this one specific waitress to take our order even though there were a ton of people standing around, LITERALLY doing nothing.   While the steal & eggs deal may sound appealing, the NY steak was honestly a  joke. I couldn't cut it with a chainsaw if I had one. I guess I shouldn't expect much for $5 but c'mon. I basically ate half of the steak and paid for some over-easy eggs with hash browns and toast. This place is a complete joke. My friends agreed that their food was HORRIBLE and that they would never come back.   Thanks for the painful shits, Coronado Cafe.",

Heck, I can't even say that it's about average, but when you get steak and eggs, hash browns, toast, and jelly for $3.95, the LEAST I could do is give this place a 3 star.  Based on food alone, I'd probably give this place a 2 star.  The steak was a little bit tough but with a bunch of sauce and pepper it compensates for the texture.  The eggs, hash browns, and toast are a nice compliment.  All this for $3.95?  I have to give it an A-OK, especially with other steak spots coming as cheap as $12 for the same amount of food.    Come during graveyard to take advantage of the cheap menu.  You can act like a baller on a budget.",

That's good enough.   It's a cafe...inside South Point. Don't expect much and don't drive all the way here for the food. I was meeting up friends who lived across the street so, I ended up here with them. I told them my dietary restrictions and they came up with the idea of ordering a turkey wrap (with chipotle mayo in the side) for me since I had to drive across town.  Everyone else got steak, omelet and a tuna sandwich. The general comment from everyone at our table: \"it was edible\". My turkey wrap came with French fries which is a weakness of mine. My friend knew it wasn't cheat day for me yet so, he asked for potato salad for him to eat. It came with fries anyway. I ate maybe 2 or 3 fries...or maybe 7 - they were good! But our nice server brought us a bowl of potato salad anyway.   The food was alright but it was the service that I liked. They were busy but our server was still oh-so pleasant and efficient.",

To summarize, The food and prices was great. They have very good deals for late night eaters. I'll definitely be back next time we are in Vegas",

Considering the waffle costs $8 this is not exactly a fair price which I expect when it comes to a casino but it's very misleading that it is advertised as chocolate chip when it is really just somewhat-chocolate flavored.",

It came with choice  of soup or salad, I chose a salad. ..nicely dressed with croutons, chewy tomatoes, olives, and cucumbers. The prime rib came with creamy horse radish and aus jus, a  baked potato with all the fixings which is what I had or French fries. I had fresh hot  coffee which was refilled  quickly.  My husband liked his 16oz Porterhouse steak topped with 2 huge crunchy Onion rings ( which um I snagged  one of them )he ordered his steak med/well. It came with soup or salad,  and he chose to have french fries with it.  It also came with garlic toast...yum! His Porterhouse special was  $14.95!!! We were too full to order desert. ..maybe next time.",

    "text": "If I was Yelping 3 years ago, I'd be the Duke by a long shot.  When I first moved to Las Vegas in 2011, South Point was my home for the first couple of months.  So that meant a lot of breakfast, lunch, and dinners at the Coronado Cafe.  Now that doesn't mean that the Coronado Cafe is a \"Must\" stop.  It just means that I was too lazy to leave the casino when the belly was calling.    So here's my review...  Service:  This really depends on the day, the time, and how busy they are.  I've gotten service as bad as 2 stars and as good as 5 stars.  Ironically, the service is actually better during the weekend nights when they are busy.  Busy here also means a lot more employees working, which means pretty good service. I found longer waits during the quiet morning/afternoons.   The Food:  There's something for everyone here. The menu is extensive and there's even Chinese Food.    My Suggestions:   -Eggs:  No one messes up eggs, Coronado doesn't either -Clam Chowder:  Pretty good stuff.  Not New England or Morro Bay good, but good enough that you'll be wanting more. -Porterhouse for $12.99:  Bang for your buck!  This is somewhat dry, so if you're use to a Medium-Well, get a Medium Plus.   -Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Surprisingly, not too bad.   -Asparagus:  Not on the menu, but they'll make it if you request it.  Good stuff! -Salmon:  I've had good and bad salmon here.  But I've had more good than bad.  Nothing really special.  Taste wise it's okay, protein wise it's worth it.  -Chicken Parmesan:  Just okay, but worth the try if you're in the mood.    Take my advice, avoid these: -Grilled Halibut Steak:  Flaky just how I like my fish, but it's too dry and really fishy.  -Prime Rib:  Taste like cardboard  -Any of their salads.  I've never had a fresh one here  Overall, I have to say that the food is just average at best.  However, Coronado fits everyone's budget.  The food is inexpensive and if you're in the casino, the restaurant is convenient.   YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (495/500)",

I'll go to your casino, eat your medium rare steak, wheat toast, hash browns, and over easy eggs, then head straight home.

I go to order it and this rude waitress tells me they're charging $1.25 per small shrimp and $5.00 per big shrimp. Wow.  So I go to order something else and that wasn't what I wanted. So I get management to find out the price of the shrimp, what she explained is not what Elisabeth explained. So graciously she goes to correct my order, now this is where it really goes wrong. The waitress comes and asks me after I've been dealing with management why did I change my order.  Now I've run a business and I know for a fact unless management is asking you to assist them, they can handle the situation on there own. So I explained to the waitress the prices she's not aware of and she walks off with an attitude.  Now it gets even worse, mind you I'm in a party of 4 and it's my birthday, and I am a music recording artist. As I'm speaking with management, the waitress comes and honkers over one of my guests shoulder to listen to our conversation. Then as management is walking off it is not the manager leading it's the waitress pulling management to the side. Who's the real boss this 70 year old lady or the one in the all black suit?  I will never advise anyone to come here and that's not in my character because I'm so easy going. Ask the cafe, I DIDNT EVEN MAKE A SCENE. I JUST LEFT AND WAS ULTIMATELY HURT.",

    "text": "Came here after midnight for the late night specials. We waited 45minutes to be sat. There were a lot of others waiting as well, place seemed to be very busy. Upon being sat we noticed empty tables everywhere and more than enough servers to cover all the sections.   Ordered biscuits and gravy, cheeseburger, and the steak with eggs and hashbrowns and a slice of cheesecake. Hard to complain about for a total of $17. However, we had to wait another 35minutes for the food.   Our server never acknowledged us. A different server took our food order. Another server brought us our drinks. Our server dropped off our food and walked away without saying or asking if we needed anything. The burger was ice cold, the fries undercooked. The steak which I asked for to be cooked medium-rare resembled a piece of charcoal. I still ate it because it was 2am and what else was I going to do? Actually we didn't eat the fries. Absolutely disgusting. Actually saw another table ask for the fries to be cooked longer so not an isolated incident.  Our server never brought the cheesecake out and actually had the audacity to drop our check off still without saying a word to us!   I counted that he had two other tables aside from ours, so in my opinion... completely inexcusable. For better service and better late night food specials visit Sundance Grill at the Silverton.",

Both were good and the price was reasonable.  The place was not too busy on a Sunday at 1pm.  The servers were polite and food was great. American within 10 minutes. The entire bill was just under $20 before tip.  On the way out of Vegas we made it back here to try the graveyard special. The food was great for the price and staff was great. No problems with the food. We both got the steak and eggs special for only 4.95. Our entire meal was a bit over $10 with taxes. Check out our photos for yourself.  Dora and pedro our servers were polite and helpful. Made pir return visit great! Came in on 3-12-17. Midnight special.",

Since I was alone, they had me sit at this awkward low counter squished between two other people.  I got my drink promptly but it took at least 15+ minutes for me to place my order. Once I placed my order the food came out super quickly. I got a wrap with fries and it wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't call it good either. Typical diner food...which I guess is not surprising considering they are always open with a full menu.  Once food is handed the server comes back one more time, asks if everything is ok and then quickly drops the check before you even really started your meal. Service wasn't good, food was standard diner food and I would not recommend unless it's your only option.",

I was immediately informed no substitutes of any kind. I settled on a bowl of chili...it was bland and would have been better off ordering it at Wendy's for a buck.

So in the interests of full-disclosure, I have never ordered anything outside of the late-night $1.95 - $5.95 menu. Maybe the food quality and service is different if you order of the complete menu, maybe its not, I wouldn't know. Suffice to say, about 90% of the people who are here after midnight are here for the steak and eggs and other specials and the servers know it.  This place is all about turn over. When the average diner is spending less than bucks on their meal, the servers try as hard as they can to get you seated, fed, and out the door. With that being said, if you are looking for actual service that you find at most hotel cafes, look somewhere else. Your server will automatically bring you waters for everyone, and your check before you are even done eating. Once the food has arrived at the table, you are highly unlikely to see your waiter again. To be honest, this doesn't surprise or irk me in the slightest. Every time I come here, I know exactly what to expect. Ok food, cheap prices, and no service. But you do get what you pay for.  The food itself is not spectacular, but its good for the price. Its a perfect place for cheap late night eats. Many of the diners are usually drunk from the dollar drinks at the bowling alley or just got back from a club. Definitely check it out if your in the area and want some cheap late night food.",

The hub ordered breakfast and he was pleased. It's tough to get eggs just the way he likes it, and they cooked them perfectly.   If you get there right at midnight, there will be a long line. People really line up for the cheap menu.",

    "text": "BEST VALUE LATE NIGHT FOOD SPECIALS IN LAS VEGAS!  The Coronado cafe (inside the SouthPointe Casino) may be a few miles South of the Strip, but it's a good place for late-night eats.  Their $3.95 steak and eggs special (including hash brown and toast) features a made-to-order steak that actually is of a decent quality!  They also have other specials, all under $4.00, that are equally tasty.  I was impressed by their service, too.  Coffees and waters were filled before we had to ask and the servers couldn't be more pleasant and helpful.  The Coronado Cafe is in a cavernous area with high ceilings, so it is huge and can be filled even at 2 am!  When we were there, I was talking to a friend so much that my food went cold.  When I asked a server to please zap it in a microwave, she returned with ALL NEW FOOD!  What a pleasant surprise.  I'd recommend the Coronado Cafe to anyone who's looking for a great late-night value.  Unfortunately, the only complaints I would have are that 1) the place is so large it can be quite noisy and 2) their late-night specials menu could include a flat pancake & egg dish.  Currently, all they offer is a pancake sandwich similar to a McGriddle.",

I feel like you have to be lucky or come I at the right time in order to get everything to come out right here. Which obviously isnt great because it should have customer priority and quality 24/7. Many others say they love getting their steak and eggs here. Although, Servers aren't good at checking up on you. The one time I've had steak n eggs here, my food was incredibly cold. One day I might consider giving them another try because I like Southpoint & everything else they have to offer.",

    "text": "This review is mainly for the taxi driver (late night) special, so I take no responsibility if you go there before midnight and are completely disappointed. Just saying.  I don't live far from SouthPoint so it's nice to have a cheap place to go to late at night after the gym when you realize that your fridge is completely empty. Thus is the life of a bachelor. This place has by far some of the best late night specials in Vegas, and believe me, I have frequented several others and they can't really hold a candle at 2am to Coronado Cafe.  The wait staff is hit or miss, but with hefty portions at $1.45-$3.95, how can you really complain?  Here's a couple of tips:  1. If you order steak and eggs (and I really believe you should), be aware that they overcook the steak, so order it one degree more rare than you are accustomed to. Unless you like it overcooked.  2. There are no substitutions. Period, end of story. Fries instead of hash browns? Not going to happen. But thats okay, Just order the cheeseburger that comes with fries in addition to your steak in eggs. It's only $3! I tend to do this when I go with my bro and we split the burger and fries while each ordering steak and eggs.  3. Arrive between hours, like at the half. Avoid arriving at the top of the hour, for some reason the line tends to grow exponentially at 12, 1, and 2am. But if you arrive around 12:30, the line diminishes.  (I don't know why, but I am going to speculate that drunk people like to arrive closer to the top of the hour. Overcompensating )",

Bus persons kept soft drink and water glasses refilled without asking. One weird note. The menu says the special is only for those over 21. Huh? My daughter's 17 and taller than me!

The food is not only cheap but it tastes good and definitely leaves you full.  Located in South Point Hotel, its the only restaurant they have that's open 24 hours so it's always got people no matter what time or day.  Wait wasn't long, 20 minutes at the most but the servers can do a little better.  They were either grumpy or forgetful. I'll cut some slack only because it was 3 in the morning and they have to work but at least smile!      Clam chowder was delicious and the burger and fries for $2.95 were just as good!
