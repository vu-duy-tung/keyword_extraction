    "text": "Rye and Woody Allen (corned beef and pastrami) - 20 bucks for an 8 inch high Everest of slim sliced beef between two pieces of store quality rye bread. Having had Katz's in Manhattan, I'd say that their pastrami on rye is still the winner. But, when in Vegas, Carnegie is a pretty decent substitute.   Complimentary pickles (3 large, mostly dill and butter) were a nice touch. So was the iced coffee with free refills: almost a good deal when on the Strip; \"only\" $3.50 for an approximately 20 oz glass. Table also has squeeze bottle horseradish sauce.  Open 24 hours; slow service. Probably the best perk of them all. If you want to save room for dessert (which is suggested if you like huge cheesecakes and black and white cookies!!), split your sandwich for $3 extra. To go bags were good enough for the plane.   Other noteworthy interesting menu items: lettuce and tomato sandwich; breakfast items; bagels and fruit cups for lighter appetites; grilled cheese for vegetarians (but no veggie sandwich); pretty much, the usual large assortment of items on a typical New York deli menu.",

My sweetheart and I shared a giant melt in your mouth hot pastrami sandwich. It was just soft rye bread, the best pastrami ever and that's it. There was nothing else on the sandwich and there didn't need to be. We declared it the best hot pastrami sandwich ever.   Note- the sandwiches are not for just one person. They are food network extreme eating challenge sized. We were way more hungry than usual and barely conquered the ginormous delicacy. Also this place is pretty expensive. We spent around $50 on a sandwich some fries, coleslaw and two drinks.",

But that's all that I can say that's good about Carnegie.  The problems include: sandwich was dry, ambiance and service is \"New York casual\", which is not meant as a compliment, and it takes a while to get your food.

They were more like a deep-fried concoction you would find at a county fair, rather than the delicious blintzes I enjoyed at Carnegie in New York. My latkes were bland, but nice and crispy.   Refills were free, unlike the NYC location, and the service was friendly and efficient.  I would go back next time we're at the Mirage, but I wouldn't order the blintzes ever again.",

I was excited, because I heard nothing but great things.   When we finally sat down to order, the menu just did not seem appetizing, their was nothing on their that interested me- and it all seemed kind of unusual.   I also didn't like that you could not change around their sandwiches- like remove the Swiss cheese and add provolone- I hate Swiss cheese- So I was forced to create my own sandwich. OH BOY! The thing was huge.   Like I could not even eat it, and had to use a fork and knife- I totally hate that- I was just expecting something different.   My boyfriend had a great time- which was the most important part- and I acted like I enjoyed every bit of it lol... I didn't want to upset him.   When the check came, I thought the bill was ridiculous, because they charged him extra for all my sides- Who does not put cheese, lettuce, tomato or onion on their sandwich...? Well I think I had to pay like $10 alone just for my side items.   Also they were so busy that it took forever to get drinks, or our food.   Overall the sandwich was okay, and it was fun to enjoy something new and a restaurant that is supposedly famous..?",

Our waitress was super friendly. The two stars are mainly for her.  $23.99 for a crappy open faced reubin...ehhh. I got a turkey one and about the only edible part was the turkey. It was slathered with melted swiss and the dressing was served on the side. Sorry. Not a good sandwich.  Greek Salad...so-so. Nothing special especially for around $18. It was large though. Enough for two people.  Fries were about the only decent part. Nice and crispy. Highly recommended by our waitress.  For $50 what a crap-shoot of a meal. We barely ate much aside from some salad and fries. I would not come back here. I know restaurants in Vegas are expensive no matter what/where you eat but seriously. The food was not worth it. Also, the sandwiches or other meals do not come with a side. So that's right...nearly $24 for a stupid tasteless sandwich by itself folks. It's sadly not what you would expect.",

There's Kosher Salamis hanging over the deli counter, drying to savory goodness.  The dessert case is drool-inducing.  It's even got the same black and white checkered tile floor as the original.  The old standby, the Woody Allen, ($17.95) stands higher than 6 inches, absolutely STUFFED with Corned Beef and Pastrami.  It's easily a sharer.  (There is a sharing charge, but if that bothers you, get it to go and eat it back in your hotel room.)  The Corned Beef is delectably packed with flavor and just fatty enough, and the spice of the Pastrami cuts through the richness.  The service here is not as rushed as in NYC, nor are the tables quite as closely packed (But they are tight.)  The cheesecake is as imposingly large as it is delicious.  I stick with the Fresh Strawberry.  I gotta say:  The pickles are better in NYC.  But being that this is 2000 miles away, and in the middle of a desert, I'd say the Carnegie @ Mirage does a fine job of living up to its' reputation.",

Where their deli sandwiches were the best we've ever had and the cheesecake flown in fresh from NYC were the ultimate.  Recently we came across Carnegie Deli, located in the Mirage and it looked impressive with their own cured meats. Sandwiches were thicker than I could stretch my mouth and it made my eyes physically look bigger than my stomach.   Tonight we tried the corned beef sandwich which like many reviews it was very good, with perfect flavorings and very tender. We also tried the hot pastrami, it lacked flavor and was very disappointing considering the proportion of the sandwich.  I had to add a LOT of pepper to make it taste decent. Lastly, we had to try the \"famous\" burger, which they advertise that they grind the burger meat themselves. Thumbs up for making a juicy burger, but again that lacked flavor.  It's almost like going to a steakhouse and ordering a succulent, juicy porterhouse and they don't season it.",

    "text": "So a certain holiday just passed around the corner and what better way to celebrate than to roadtrip with a couple of the homies to Vegas! We originally intended to hit up the Grand Canyon, but logic came to our senses and we decided otherwise.   For once, I don't have a sweet description of the place. It's quite typical really as it's located inside The Mirage. I mean, I guess they feel the need to offer several types of cuisines for those that have different moods and appetites. And that's understandable. But when using such a name like Carnegie, one should at least match the quality and ingredients that go into a meal. Not saying that I didn't enjoy of course.   When ordering, they were missing several key ingredients like Rye Bread and such. How can you run an establishment without a staple in some sandwiches?! I'm normally not very critical and quite understanding, but no Rye? Makes me wanna go Homer status. All good though as I ordered myself an open-bread Turkey and Gravy along with Mashed Potatoes or the Nosh, Nosh Nanette (apparently, named after a musical). The portions are HUUUUUUUUUUUGE!!!!! How do I put a mental image on you fellow yelpers and yelpettes?! If the Hulk, the Juggernaut, and the Blob all went through what Goku and Vegeta do when they fusion and form one being......  ....alright, I exaggerated just a tiny bit. But you guys get what I'm trying to put across.   So other than them missing ingredients and such, I was actually pretty satisfied withe the whole experience. Adding of course that we drove the  Valley and enjoying our meal at 4AM and missing class the same morning, it was still quite delicious. I didn't get to have their cheesecake this time as I was ready to explode, put back into pieces, and blow up again! Of course, this doesn't compare to their Manhattan location (except for the service, cause them east coast peeps can be vicious for this poor little valley boy...NOT) but it did the job. So whenever you're around The Mirage, stop by and give it a try.",

There is WAY too much pastrami, to the point where someone could have a heart attack right there and then. (Good thing I am CPR certified!)  Anyways, the fries here were average. I have had much better. They were not seasoned well. I tried the chicken noodle soup, but to my surprise when I opened the carton all I saw were noodles. Excuse me, I ordered CHICKEN noodle soup, not noodle soup. I was disappointed!  There was no vegetables or anything else in there. The flavor was also very bland. Next  I tried the egg and ham sandwich, and once again it lacked flavor. This place is pricey, and definitely not worth your taste buds to try.",

Too bad having a pound of pastrami between two tiny slices of bread is only great in theory.  I ordered the hot pastrami sandwich here.  The sandwich is indeed huge, and the pastrami itself was pretty good, but after eating the sandwich, I began to realize how much I LIKE having some greens, mayo, and cheese in my sandwiches.  The sandwich exploded after a few bites anyway so it almost became just eating a plate full of pastrami with some bread.  I found myself licking grease off the roof of my mouth after the meal, which kinda just made me feel very unhealthy.  I tried a bit of their regular cheesecake.  It's different from a lot of other cheesecakes you'll find, because it's a lot creamier and taller, but it was lacking in flavor.  If you do order a cheesecake, don't order it plain.  In conclusion: You get what they advertise, but after the first few bites, you may realize that it's not a good thing.",

No refills, and hardly touched - I could have cooked a whole meal for that price!   Also on the menu was a pastrami sandwifch, a hamburger, some french fries, and french toast.  Total cost of lunch $85+  Sorry, but I won't be back.  I can find food just as good without being taken advantage of!",

    "text": "So under normal circumstances I would never pay $15 for a pastrami sandwich, but I was in one of my preggers-like food craving moods where I felt like at this moment in time I ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NEEDED PASTRAMI  And pastrami I shall have!  When I finally received my pastrami sandwich, I was pleasantly surprised to find a sandwich bigger than my face!  This was nothing like the pastrami sandwiches we had back in San Diego!  However, I was not so pleasantly surprised to find that this Goliath of a pastrami sandwich did not contain any tomatoes, lettuce or even swiss cheese, a pastrami sandwich staple!    I quickly got over that fact when I finally bit into the thing.  The meat was juicy, tender and seasoned to perfection, and the rye bread was soft and delicious.  The sandwich also comes with a side of deli mustard (yessss!) and a pickle, and was so big I split it with a friend and still had enough left over for breakfast.  Carnegie would have received 4 stars only I remember the customer service being a bit on the sub-par side and tomatoes and lettuce were an additional $3.75.  Really?  Really?",

Relatively lean pastrami, and the horseradish mustard on the table is a great match.  (I made a kickass corned beef & pastrami hash with the leftovers today.)  Yesterday I tried the cheese blintzes and a potato pancake.  Blintzes... fried?  Deep-fryer action?  Very odd, but the filling was fantastic.  The potato pancake was good, not too greasy, some noticeable onion action in there.  But here is where they lose a star from me - $13 for three small blintzes.  $5 for a decent-sized potato pancake.  I think I was offended by the receipt which listed the potato pancake as \"latkes\" - as in multiple items.  Uh, no, you really did charge me $5 for one latke.   Service was also really slow.  But this was the best deli dining I've experienced east of the Mississippi (not including Canter's in LA).",

My friends had already eaten so I decided to take a quick bite here while they were gambling. I ordered a Reuben sandwich; nothing more, nothing less. I was completely shocked when they came out with my sandwich and it was 3 lbs of meat completely draped in cheese. It looked like a baby wrapped in a blanket. I barely ate a quarter of it so I had to box the rest. I was laughing until I got my check and it costed around $40. I looked at the menu and saw that they had regular sized Reubens and was completely shocked as to why they didn't give me that one. Did I say Super size me!? All I tasted was meat and cheese. The bread was completely hidden under all that ridiculousness.  By far the funniest experience I've had at a restaurant. They should really specify what size sandwich you want before ripping you off.",

I ordered the pastrami hash, the pastrami was very good i like how it was toasted on the griddle, i just wish the potatoes were more crispy, more like home fries, the soft potatoes didn't do it for me.  Other people ordered a corned beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich which were both large and tasty.  We also got an order of fries too, they were crispy, next time i'll ask them to fry some pastrami and put it over my fries with an egg on top?  Both sandwiches were good but i liked the pastrami sandwich at Stage in the MGM better.",

Once we saw all of the people around us getting huge meals we decided to share our sandwich. (Although I've worked in the industry for many years as a server and bartender, Ive always had a special type of hatred for the people who shared meals like sandwiches) but seriously this sandwich was HUGE! and delicious. We also had one of their potato pancakes, which was probably the best potato pancake I've ever had! So good. Although our waitress was a bit un attentive, we still had a great time. and the food came out quick! Next stop is Carnegie NYC! I've heard it's better than Vegas but I kind of think its impossible!",

Ask for pickles as soon as you sit down, then ask for some more, than ask for more and take them back to the hotel room with you. They are that good.  This is the same Carnegie you can find in NYC, minus the fact this one takes credit cards, NYC only cash.  Couple of pointers here: you are going to have WAY WAY too much food so make sure you share something.  It is also very pricey [like $25 for a sandwich but if you divide that by 2 =$12.50 sandwich].  This place isn't cheap but it sure is worth it.  My friend and I go here and to the one in NYC and we always get the same thing:  Reuben, extra plate extra Rye bread,  potato pancake or fries [depending on how hungover we are on the hangover scale], Russian dressing on the side, maybe macaroni salad, and ice teas [again NYC charges you for refills even for ice-tea].

At that price you want to finish your meal but it was too much food!  Maybe they could give smaller portions and charge a little less. One order of fries would serve 2 people.  Service was beyond horrible. We ordered takeout to take back to our room.  I ordered a cheeseburger plain (just cheese) & fries.  My daughter then said that she wanted the exact same.  When I saw the man working behind the counter I saw him wrap up a burger with lettuce & tomato & start to put it on our bag.  I reminded him that she had wanted her burger plain too.....he was visibly angry and asked why she hadn't told him that.  I said she did tell him when she said she wanted her burger \"exactly\" like mine.  He then scooped all of the toppings off the burger slammed the bun on wrapped it up threw it in the bag.    He then started throwing dishes around (no lie) to the point that even his co-workers were staring at him.  It was all just surreal.  I can honestly say that had not/was not ever rude to this man, but I was not willing to pay $60 at a deli for burgers and fries & then accept a wrong order.   Again, the food was pricey but good however the service was scary.",

The sandwich was not nearly as large as NYC but plenty for my daughter and I. Taste was good but not as moist as I would have liked. The rye bread was dry. Not close to NYC standards. All told, it hit the spot though! We also shared a bowl of matzo ball soup with noodles. They provide extra broth on the side. Portion, like everything here, was huge. Matzo ball was light and delicious. Expect Las Vegas prices but you will leave satisfied.",

I had The Rueben for which they are famous.    \"Piled high\" is a term used too frequently by other places selling sandwiches but here they really mean it.  I'm not a lightweight and I had trouble finishing that thing.     The service was good.  Order by the register then grab a table.  The server will come and check your receipt and bring out your drinks then the food when it's ready.  I would come back and try other things, but there are so many options near and far it is going to be difficult to squeeze them in.",

Open till 2am Friendly service You don't have to fly to New York and wait in that insane line at the real location.  Cons: Prices are stiff.  They charge you extra for wanting to share one of the mammoth thing they call sandwiches  Like any other True fattie we ordered the Woody Allen which was 2lbs of pastrami and corned beef on 2 tiny slices of bread. I'm not insane and I do appreciate arterial function so me and the woman split this bad boy. Be warned if you are looking for taste, this is not the place for you. The meat was dry and flavorless and had to be drowned in deli mustard in order to be palatable. I have been to NY and have had my mind blown by a pastrami tower at Broadway Deli so I know that this isn't how NY sandwiches are supposed to be like. All in and all, we plugged away at it and doing so killed the entire bottle of deli mustard.   We can proclaim that we came and conquered \"The Woody.\"  I categorize this one to the \"been there ate that\" category.So if playing Man vs Food is your thing then add Carnegie Deli to your list. If you still have a working mouth full of taste buds and enjoy using them, this place is a miss...",

One tip I have is if you do get the large sandwich, make sure you have at least 2 different kinds of meats because it sure gets hard to eat after a while, especially since the taste of the meat gets old real fast when it's the same thing over and over again. My recommendation: corned beef and beef tongue.  The other tip is to maybe just split the sandwich with someone else, but be aware there's a $3 sharing fee associated with that.",

Took me about a good 10 mins to finally get someone attention, and additional 5 mins to get my bill.  Their pastrami sandwich was just okay, tasted more like a typical pastrami sandwich you can get anywhere. Maybe I came in with too much hope for this place, but at the time we arrive, it was probably a given when there was no line. I should have taken it as a hint that this place wasn't a hit in Vegas.

I really like the pickles brought out to the table, but oddly enough, if you want pickles on your burger, you have to slice them yourself.  My wife had eggs, which were cooked incorrectly, but they fixed it quickly.  We came back late night on a different day for the banana creme pie, also great, but man, it was big.

Replica of the Original Carnegie Deli in NY. Everything is the same here. They are known for their outrageously large sandwiches. These sandwiches are not made for 1 person & must be shared. The amount of food that is wasted here is beyond ridiculous. Especially for those visiting most of us aren't going to take our food up to our rooms. Weren't able to find homeless people roaming outside to give our left overs to so it wait straight to the trash sadly. That being said love the diner feel here, casual & no fuss. We ordered a classic pastrami on rye. The sandwich was exactly the same in taste & shape of their NY location. The pastrami is properly cured, seasoned, & tender. It was freakin delicious. Piled high like a \"Call your Mommy that's alotta Pastrami\"!  The pickled were the bomb they house make them & baby does it have crunch & flavor. We tried to finish 1 sandwich split between 2adults & barely made a dent sadly.  The service here is not the best. reminds me of typical New York dilemma. Don't like the fact that you order at the counter & get a number since they have table servers. It's a disgusting tactic to get tipped before terrible service is given.  The food is worth 5 stars but all the negatives stated minus 2 stars.",

I must agree, the prices are super expensive. I think it was 15$? or more. I guess it's located inside Mirage which is why. Hey it's still beat eating McDonald though and it was the only thing open.

My girlfriends and I walked around the whole Mirage hotel looking for a restaurant to serve breakfast. Finally, we found Carnegie deli that served breakfast all day!  Dying of hunger, the service was quick and efficient. We were sat and a server came to us right away. I got the basic eggs and bacon, the portion was more then enough.  My friends and I were more then satisfied that we came back the next morning to have breakfast. None of us had the pastrami sandwich, but it looked ginormous! I'll have to go to NYC for that!",

We were staying at The Mirage and decided to swing by Carnegie Deli on Thursday, May 11th around 7pm to grab some takeout.  *CHOPPED LIVER PLATTER: potato salad, coleslaw, and chopped liver with lettuce, tomato and onion ($17.99) *THE REUBEN: Our \"famous\" open-style sandwich piled high with your choice of corned beef, pastrami or turkey, Topped with melted Swiss cheese & sauerkraut ($24.99)  The sandwich was huge. But for $25, it better be! I asked for both corned beef and pastrami in the reuben, but I think they only gave us pastrami. I like my pastrami a little fatter as I think it makes the sandwich more comforting. The boys and I shared this and it was enough to feed the three of us. The chopped liver platter was a good way to sample some of their sides. I liked eating the liver with the reuben as I thought it added an extra creaminess. The rest of the salads were just okay. We also got two pickles so I think each order came with one. I love pickles, so I enjoyed these.  Expensive, but huge sandwiches. I've actually never been to a New York deli, but overall, I thought the sandwiches here were just all right.",

A look at their menu will also catch your attention because the prices are ridiculously high. $17 for a sandwich? Seriously?   Well if you like Pastrami, whip that debit card out and order a Pastrami sandwich. And be prepared for a downright massive sandwich to be put in front of you that will make your eyes do a double take. It's freakin HUGE! And yes, it's as good as it looks. Again, if Pastrami is your thing or if you're craving it, you need to give Carnegie a try. I'm also a fan of their Lox and Bagel....it definitely took care of my craving for lox which I get from time to time.   Service...can be hit or miss. And sometimes the staff can have an attitude. And again the prices are RIDICULOUS! While my debit card wasn't happy I walked out of Carnegie very happy and my stomach wasn't complaining either.   4 Stars. Even the ridiculous prices won't keep me from coming back.",

The line wasn't too long to order at all and it was about a 10 minute wait time to get the 2 sandwiches which isn't bad considering there were other take out orders waiting ahead of us.  Hot Pastrami ($17.99) - You can add cheese for an extra $2, I added Swiss. I asked for sourdough bread and that wasn't a problem. The pastrami was tender and delicious. I was impressed that the bread didn't break while eating the sandwich, it held the meat nicely. Some people think this place is too expensive. I personally don't mind paying the price per sandwich because it's stacked, tasty and filling. The sandwiches also come with a whole pickle and you can add a side of fries for $2.99.   I've eaten inside a few times years ago, but have only done that when company is in town and wants to come here. Hubby and I usually just pop in to grab a couple of sandwiches to go. They also serve breakfast, soup, salad and have dessert. Carnegie is located inside The Mirage.",

The deli seemed to be able to handle the large crowd; quickly and efficiently. Even affording everyone a seat, by the time your sandwich is ready.    I opted for the lunch combo of half a sandwich, potato salad and a drink for $15.99.  The sandwich was piled with too much meat for anyone to really eat.  I added cheese to the 1/2 sandwich for $2.  The meat was cold, but thickly sliced and good. The potato salad was a tasty rendition of deli/German potato salad.   Service was fast and friendly. Restaurant was clean and had adequate seating.",

Orders are placed at the counter, a number is given, and then food is brought to the table.   The menu includes the typical deli sandwiches, soups, and an impressive selection of desserts. Pricing initially seemed high, but once we saw the portion we agreed that the price was reasonable. The dining area has a cafeteria feel plenty of seating in an area closed off from the casino.   Since my husband and I weren't too hungry we shared a Reuben which is served open-style. If we had been really hungry this still would have been a significant amount of food to serve one person. The sandwich was really good, every ingredient was delicious. The meat made up most of the sandwich and was piled high with plenty of melted cheese on top. Breakfast is served all day so my brother opted for breakfast and really enjoyed it. On next visit I'll have to get try deli favorites like blintzes, potato pancakes, or matzo ball soup.  Overall, a good option for good food served quickly at a reasonable price (for The Strip).",

Our sandwiches came out stacked with Pastrami on warm delicious Rye Bread. Very good sandwich with Pastrami that was so tender it almost melted in your mouth. The potato salad was also delicious. This restaurant although a little pricey which is the norm for the Vegas Casino Hotels was very good and well worth the cost for the great service and delicious food. Our server was well aware of the time that our show started and made sure we were served quickly and we ultimately had plenty of time to get to our show on time.",

When I say HUGE, I mean we could have split one omelet, never mind that we each got one. Basically, we only had breakfast to eat all day since it was so much food.    My boyfriend wanted to go back for lunch before we left Vegas when he saw the pistrami/corned beef sandwiches. It didn't interest me, but he was very happy. I wasn't that hungry and truthfully, even if I was starving, I would never/could never put a dent in one of these sandwiches. One sandwich was $25 and it was bigger than my head. He couldn't open his mouth that big to eat it. Everyone was raving about the great sandwiches and actually taking pictures with the sandwiches because they were so big, but I wish they could have an $8 or $10 sampler, so normal people like me could have a normal size sandwich......... even if there's only one piece of bread!  The food is good quality, and the servings are large, but be ready to pay. I'd rather have smaller quantity for less money. Service is pretty slow both times we were there and not very friendly, but that wouldn't stop my boyfriend from coming back. If we do go back, I will do the same thing I did the second time we were there - just  order water and be careful not to get caught having a bit of his sandwich, since they charge $12 for sharing.",

Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.  We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?  My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The \"Hash Browns\" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The \"Side of Bacon\" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.  Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast.   All in all, an okay experience but would only come back for convenience (a.k.a. when staying at the Mirage and cannot make it to a restaurant outside the hotel).  TIP: Size isn't everything.

After indulging in Fat Tuesday's awesome big-ass drinks, we decided to eat here. For some reason, alcohol will imbibe some sort of food courage in you. Specifically the peach bellini with an extra shot.  My brother and sister-in-law were smart and decided to share the \"Woody Allen\", which was two lbs of meat (pastrami and corned beef, but they got all pastrami). My husband and I, alcohol in tow, decided against logic and each ordered our own \"Woody Allen\", all pastrami. Once the food came, our mouths dropped in amazement... These suckers were massive! Each half of the sandwich was precariously held together by wooden skewers. I took one bite and immediate felt giddy with happiness. Meaty, juicy, and packed with flavor... Definitely worth the $20+ price tag. We rashly ordered sides, but figured we might as well, since it was our last night in Vegas. Go big or go home, right? Two sides, coleslaw and pickles. The coleslaw was okay, but their house made pickles were delish!   45 minutes later, we tapped out. Needless to say, our eyes were too big for our tummies because we both ate equivalent of half a sandwich... we should have just split one. Took our leftovers with us to eat as a late night snack.  Go. Eat. This. Now.",

Still, a reasonable price would have been half of that price, but whatever, we were hungry and didn't want Denny's on the strip.   This cafe did it's job for us in that it fed us when we were hungry late into the night (or morning). Would I come back? Probably not.

We got the Woody Allen (corned beef and pastrami). We are both healthy eaters and we had to share this one, we were both full and still took home a normal sized sandwich. Your server will bring you extra slices of bread to make more sandwiches. The darn sandwich could be a decent snack for 4 people lol - If you have caught on... what I am trying to say are the sandwiches are huge. The atmosphere is typical, lots of people walking by as it is very close the LV Blvd entrance. I'd do it again, if I was in the mood.",

This place gives you a really thick amount of pastrami in your sandwich. You can see in the pictures here. The thinly sliced bread isn't enough to support all that meat. They should serve all that yummy pastrami in a roll instead.  Fries are a steep price ($5.95) but they are huge and we were able to share one order amongst 5 people with leftovers. They also will charge a sharing fee which sucks since the sandwiches are so big and we all can't take the leftovers home since we're on vacation. :(  Oh but our waiter was nice enough to not charge the share fee if you just order something else to eat such as fries.",

I paid $25 for my Corned Beef Reuben.  Plus, this wasn't even a sandwich.  It was 2 peices of Rye laying on the plate with literally 5 pounds of Corned Beef, and 1/2 ound of swiss.  I had to eat it with a fork.  I had a about 6 bites of it and I was done.    It took us about 30 minutes to get a table, then about 15 minutes to get the drinks, then another 10 to order our meal, and another 30 minutes to receive the food.  I was so pissed.  I'm not going to even get into how long it took to get the bill, ask questions about it, then finally get change.  BTW, i didnt even get the check from the original waitress.  So, I decided to get a box to bring the food with me because i could not through it out.  I put it in a bag, and I ended up carrying it around with me all over Las Vegas because i still had to get a hotel room for the night.  Pretty bad experience.    Overall, service SUCKS.  Portions are WAY to big.  The Potato Knish was the best thing i ever had and is the only reason i gave this place 3 stars.",

Also, my charge went through, but the tip is pending separately (a double charge, since it was paid with the total). I have tried to call them twice, but nobody will answer the phone. I only ate there because I was hungry before the Beatles Love show; otherwise if I had not been a captive audience I would have eaten somewhere else. I had to ask for my bread to be toasted, and the sandwich was dry. They squish you in at little tables, and you feel like you are eating with the stranger who is sitting less than a foot to your side. TOTALLY overpriced for what you get, but hey, you are at The Mirage in Las Vegas. Big Whoop!",

I ordered the bacon and eggs and got like 6 huge strips of bacon. There is no way in hell any person should eat that much bacon in one sitting! I also feel sorry for my brother who ordered the tuna melt and was disappointed that he didn't even take it to go, something that he rarely does.

    "text": "First let me say that I was raised on good Jewish deli, homemade matzoh balls, homemade gefilte fish etc. I think I'm a pretty good judge of good deli.   I'd eaten here for breakfast before and was quite happy. I'd say my only complaint is the portion size. They are absolutely ridiculous! The guy at the table next to us ordered a side of bacon(jewish deli,bacon?) I guess when he ordered a side he didn't realize it meant the entire side of the pig. It had to have been a pound when uncooked. It's one thing to give huge portions in a neighborhood deli where you might be able to take home your leftovers, but in a hotel with no in room fridge it means throwing away a lot of food. I guess it is Vegas, everything in excess.   We came for lunch and were seated by the hostess then waited. . . and waited. . . and waited. When the waitress came over it was only to tell us she'd be right with us, we waited some more. Finally she came and took our order.   I ordered the Pastrami Reuben. It's my favorite deli sandwich. I was expecting a sandwich similar to the other 150 or so I've eaten over the years. I was expecting pastrami, Swiss and sauerkraut on grilled rye. That's not how they make a Reuben here. They layed three small pieces of untoasted, ungrilled rye on the plate. This was then covered by a mountain(at least 3/4 of a pound) of the driest pastrami I've ever eaten in my life. on top of this was placed a nearly undetectable layer of kraut. This was all topped by 4-5 slices of Swiss. The entire plate was then placed under a broiler for about 15 seconds. The cheese wasn't even half way melted. $25 for a Reuben and you charge another $4.50 for the smallest side of slaw I've ever been served.   My daughters matzoh ball soup wasn't much better. It was a decent matzo ball floating with some strange noodles in tasteless yellow salt water. I'm guessing the yellow was food coloring as I doubt a chicken ever touched that broth.   On to what I will generously call service. Once we saw our waitress, everything came out fairly quickly, except our slaw. This we had to ask for. People have commented on how great the pickles were. I can't comment since I never saw any. We never saw our waitress again until she came to ask if we wanted dessert. Since the sandwich that I split($3.00 up charge) was hardly touched on both our plates it may have been a clue that we didn't want anything else. She left the check. It was incorrect. When we finally were able to flag her down to correct we didn't even have to tell her what was wrong. She said \"it's the two orders of slaw right?\" So she knew it was wrong when she set it down. Was she hoping we wouldn't notice? Was she thinking extra money for the restaurant will mean a bigger tip for her?   Would I ever eat here for lunch or dinner ever again, not a chance! Would I come back for breakfast? Maybe. By the way, it was only because of my past breakfast experience that this place got two stars.   I sure hope the Carnegie Deli in New York is better because the Las Vegas location takes the prize as the worst Jewish deli I've ever eaten in. Shame on you.",

It's not like I'm asking for something amazing. And just like the Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas doesn't compare to Munich (see my other review), this does not compare to New York.  First of all, the bread is not as fresh. The meat portions, though still generous, are less too. The service was good, as was the location (right next to the sports book in the Mirage). However, it is also more expensive than the expensive Carnegie Deli in New York. Combine it all together, and I was sad. I had my hopes up, and it was just... lacking.  Still, maybe if I find myself up after placing a bet on some sports game at the Mirage, maybe I'll head on over (inebriated would help), and get my pastrami on rye. And then I'll reminisce about my trip to New York... and the real thing...  Then again, if I was up enough, I could just fly to New York and get the real thing. One can hope...",

I wasn't able to finish half without feeling overwhelmed with the mountain of meat I had before me.  Even though the sandwich was ok, the mustard sauce that came with it was amazing. It really added the kick I wanted. It made the sandwich that much better.   I had to chow down on some of the meat first to make the meal enjoyable. Make sure to use the wrapper to eat it. Don't bother trying to pick up the sandwich as is. It will fall apart on you, guarantee.",

One of the places I remember from the city was going to Carnegie Deli a few times and being blown away by the HUGE sandwiches they served. That's why I was happy to find out that Carnegie opened up a restaurant in the Mirage Casino in Las Vegas. My family has gone there several times, and it is as good as the times I went to the original one in NYC. Always enjoy the pastrami or Reuben or BLT's there. They are gigantic, and rarely can we finish them. No flashes, no gourmet here, just BIG, basic, and traditional deli hits at Carnegie.",

While there, I broke my high heel, watched hubby win $80 playing penny slots, and witnessed the eighth wonder of the world being placed in front of my dad at Carnegie Deli.  We initially decided to not eat dinner and then realized that you cannot party appropriately without something other than frozen drinks in your belly.  We went to Carnegie and the waitress convinced dad to order the Woody Allen- corned beef and pastrami.  Dad went with it. Mom ordered a BLT, hubby ordered a chicken breast sandwich and I ordered a grilled cheese with bacon.  I was the smartest in the group as my food was of average size.  Mom had at least a pound of bacon on her BLT and Dad...well, Dad was presented with a ten inch tall mountain of meat. My drunk bootie thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen and proceeded to take a video of it. It's on youtube.  Overall, this place is a kick, although they do waste an extraordinary amount of food.",

However, the food came put bigger and a lot better!! the steak was cooked perfectly. Just wish there wasn't as much fats on the steak, but for 10$ .. im more than satisfied !",

Never even acknowledged. Finally a waiter grabbed me a table. Found the menu to be HIGHLY OVERPRICED. 22 bucks for a sandwich get out of here. I just wanted something small. Then this is the only cafe style restaurant in Mirage and the place is serving Buffalo venison liver and onions. I highly doubt there is a large calling for this in Vegas after a night of drinking. My husband ordered \"the special\" It was special alright....Special and Old. He felt sick after he ate it. Unfortunately do to limited options we had to eat here on more than one occasion. This is one of the reasons I won't be staying at Mirage again.",

Yes, the sandwich was extremely expensive, but it was HUGE and I thought it was delicious.  I also really enjoyed their mustard and pickles.  Even though Carnegie is a deli typically specializing in deli meats, they actually had one of the best hamburgers I had in years.   The burger was not only moist and juicy but it had exceptionally good flavor.  Believe me, I was surprised such a burger can come out of a deli.  Their french fries were delicious as well.  Yes, everything pretty much comes ala carte but their french fries were tasty.  Lastly we ordered some dessert, yes their NY cheesecake is something you don't want to miss (especially if you love cheesecake).  But the surprise was their silk chocolate cake.  It was better than I had expected and was a fine conclusion to a meal.  Carnegie may be a NY deli cliche but they really do have some delicious selections and an exceptional burger.  If you come to LV and have a craving for deli meats, this is the place I would go.  Decor: 3 Stars (decorated like a deli) Service: 3 Stars (okay service) Atmosphere: 3 Stars (not bad) Food Quality: 5 Stars (really great) Quantity of Food: 5 Stars (how can anyone finish their portions?) Price: 4 Stars (almost worth the high price)  For a Grand Total of 4 Stars.",

    "text": "Located inside the Mirage, Carnegie Delicatessen is a \"New York\" style deli serving casual food. I came here twice during my stay in Vegas, once for Breakfast and another time for lunch and both times, I did leave full, but disappointed.   It has the Carnegie Delicatessen has the \"NY\" feel to it and located almost in the middle of the casino. Open 24hours they offer a good selection of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. Prices here at Carnegie Delicatessen are on the high side. Basic breakfast items such as omelets, pancakes, and such, starting around $8 and goes as high as $20. Sides here will run you around $4 - $5. For lunch they offer a good selection of hot and cold sandwiches and things like chicken livers, hash, meatloaf, etc starting around $12 - $24. Pretty spendy for the type of food you get that usually runs about at half the price.   For breakfast, just needed something to fill the stomach and got a basic bagel and cream cheese. The bagel, well for a \"NY\" deli, tasted something I could get at Costco. Honestly, nothing special. Everyone else got eggs and one guy got a burger and fries at 6AM and they ate it because after a night of drinking, what else are you going to do. The waitress at this time was a bit bitchy, but not sure if it was us or she was just in a foul mood. Also the service was slow and she forgot my friend's fries.   When I came here for lunch with my brother, service here was nonexistent. They had plenty of servers, at one point I think I counted about 4 or 5 of them gathered just chatting away in a corner while several of us were waiting to get served and several tables had dirty dishes on them.   Brother was suffering from a hangover and decided to get the mozaball soup and I got the hot dog and some fries. When we got our food, I have to give them credit for their portion size. My brother got a big bowl of soup and I got literally a foot long hot dog and a plate of fries piled up high. My brother didn't like his soup at all and this even suffering from a massive hangover when anything tastes good. My hot dog was decent though the homemade sauerkraut was excellent. It was probably a notch better than a hotdog you would be able to get at Costco as it was a bit spicy which I liked. The fries were ok. Nothing special to report about.   The waitress on the other hand, was more interested in talking to her fellow servers than say, bring us a bill. My brother and I waited about 15 minutes before we flagged down someone else to bring us our bill and that took an additional 10 minutes as 2 other tables in our same area requested the same thing.   As to rating, honestly the food is just average but its WAY overpriced. The service here is just plain lousy both times I came here. There are SO MANY other options here, that Carnegie Delicatessen is a waste of time and unless you're coming here at 3AM and no other place is open, I would highly advise people to skip out. They got good portions, but that's about it, 2 stars for Carnegie Delicatessen.",

When I was in New York, I went to Carnegie and found it odd that all the waiters seemed to be Chinese dudes. Well, here in the Las Vegas branch of the Carnegie Deli in the Mirage that still was the case - all the male waiters were Chinese. The female waitstaff were a mixed bag. But all of that is neither here nor there I just thought it was odd but amusing. We ordered the Pastrami sandwich and ended splitting one sandwich among two people. The pastrami sandwich itself was very good and juicy. I also liked the salted pickles on the side. But even though we split the sandwich, the portions were still huge and we barely could finish our \"halves\". I'd highly recommend splitting with a friend - unless you're one of those \"Man versus Food\" folks and pride yourself on being able to finish food challenges where the portions are ridiculously huge. If you ARE one of those folks, don't forget to stop by the Heart Attack Grill on Fremont later for those octuple bypass burgers with 40 bacon slices and a free trip to Sunrise Hospital.",

It feels like you're dining in a New York deli and designed as an authentic deli restaurant with Vegas strip pricing.   I ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich and that was humungous. I shared half of it with my friend and she couldn't finish it! Originally I was thinking of ordering the corn beef sandwich but it was just too massive to finish and a total diet killer!   Service was over the top and and didn't disappoint. In fact our server was checking in on us even though he was slammed with customers and that is a multi tasking skill that every server should have. Food was delicious and couldn't fault on anything. It nice trying out Carnegie Deli but I'll just stick to BLT Burger just right around the corner.",

So Diane and I headed over, and I braced myself for Matzoh Ball Soup and a gigantic corned beef or pastrami sandwich.  To my surprise, by ordering a Woody Allen I could have both.  The name of the sandwich almost deterred me from ordering it, because I am definitely not a fan of Woody Allen.  But in the end I relented and ordered it along with a bowl of Chicken Broth with Matzoh Balls.  After I had devoured all four juicy complimentary pickles, and getting more, the soup arrived.  Two very large Matzoh Balls arrived in a large bowl along with chicken broth contained in a shiny silver metal container.  After I poured out the broth and filled the bowl, there was still broth left over.  So the portion was quite generous.  Diane ordered noodles to go with one Matzoh Ball, which I sampled, and they were thin and went well with the lightly seasoned chicken broth and really good, light and fluffy Matzoh Balls.  We also shared an order of French Fries, which arrived quite hot and filled an entire platter.  But the piece de resistance was my sandwich.  It is actually larger than the standard sandwiches on the menu, which already are enormous, and cost just under $20.00.  It was g-normous (whatever is larger than enormous), and after taking one look at it, I knew I would be taking a full half of the sandwich home.  And that is exactly what occurred.  It is definitely one of the best sandwiches I have consumed: half corned beef intermixed with pastrami, all moist and warm, likely hefting at least 1 lb. of meat per half, on supple Jewish Rye (see pics).  And, it was just excellent!  After removing the toothpicks holding everything together, I managed to eat some bites normal sandwich style before resorting to knife and fork.  And, I really had to push myself to finish a complete half.  But at length I did.  Service was very good and efficient.  I quickly received Heinz mild yellow mustard and additional pickles on request.  The place was comfortable with a deli feel to it.  And, I polished off the second half of that sandwich split into lunch and dinner the next day.  But even before that I tipped my home scale 4-3/4 pounds heavier than the day before.  Believe me, the appetizers from Stack at Revolution before the Terry Fator Show did not cause that gain.  Half of a Woody Allen did!  I will eat at Carnegie more often, but to keep my weight under some reasonable control I think I will only order the Woody Allen again on at best an annual basis.",

She saw us sit but continued to set her tables for a good 10 minutes before acknowledging us. When she did come over she got our drinks and the food came out fairly quickly. That's when the service ended. She literally disappeared. I needed sauce because my sandwich was dry. Went to to the counter and they told me to \"ask my waitress\". When I responded \"I would if I could find her\" they recluctantly handed me one and said if I needed more to ask my waitress. Well that couldn't happen because she never came back. We finished our meal, choked it down since she never refilled our water, then we sat there with empty plates that never got picked up. We had been eyeing their desserts since we walked in so I decided to order a piece of cake and a glass of milk. Even though they cut my slice right in front of me they gave me a number and said the waitress would bring it to the table. So again, we waited. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and then I became really irritated and walked to the counter and asked for them to just hand me my damn cake. Seeing my obvious irritation the sent over a manger and when told of my experience she did apologize and not charge me for my dessert as well as gave me her card so I can return and be taken care of correctly this time. (When she saw the manager the waitresses suddenly miraculously appeared and started clearing away plates. (Seriously this woman was nowhere in sight the whole time we were eating and waiting for the cake) The managed and the food are the only reason they get 2 stars. However, the damage has been done and with all the food choices we have in Vegas we will not be returning here.",

I was somewhat disappointed as there in no personal table service and some items are now missing from the menu.  You have to order your meal before finding a table to sit at.

    "text": "A  quick look at my photos from my dinner at the Carnegie Deli will show just how very far this place is from New York.  I'm not a huge fan of Pastrami sandwiches as big as my head.  I'm sensitive to salt, so long ago said goodbye to massive amounts of processed meat.  A few slices at a time?  Yes, please.  The sandwiches at this restaurant each hold more than a year's worth of lunchmeat for me.    What I love are pirogue and blintzes.  Love them so much that I served pirogue on my wedding buffet, each of them hand made by my elderly Polish neighbor.  Blintzes bring me back to childhood, leaning past my grandmother's elbow as she flipped crepe after crepe.  When she died I inherited the frying pan that she used to make the crepes for her blintzes.  I realize that these childhood experiences might make me pickier than normal, but I am also lenient.  The blintz pan hasn't been used in years, and I buy my pirogue in the freezer section.    Unfortunately, Carnegie Deli also buys their pirogue in the freezer section.  I suspect that they buy larger portions than I do, but these tasted nothing like homemade.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wxwEK9cfsowGRcjiYv3KSQ&userid=dyEc-BsP_qPzIWyiMW0BPw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> They were deep fried, and bland.  I was so thankful that I had thought to ask for onions, because they were not served as a standard part of the meal. I'm so sorry that they were what made me happiest in my dining experience.  The blintzes were an abomination.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qp0F6LQ3Z8tRUnLXqFKrYw&userid=dyEc-BsP_qPzIWyiMW0BPw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> Deep fried and filled with what can best be described as pancake batter blended with cheese bits.  It was truly awful, and had nothing to do with an actual plate of blintzes.    And finally the only almost bright spot (at least color wise!) in my meal, the stuffed cabbage.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=O_wCcHuL0WxqEVM2Ab5uyw&userid=dyEc-BsP_qPzIWyiMW0BPw  This was not awful, but was not wonderful.  The sauce was far too sweet, but was tasty enough.  To add insult to injury, the bill for my portion of dinner was nearly $30.  I ate as much of it as I could, but left at least as much behind.  No need to complain, because there was no quick remedy for what was wrong.  I do have a firm resolve to stear clear of\"New York STYLE\" delis for the foreseeable future.",

The crowd, depending on what time of day and day of week you go, ranges from trucker-looking implants from the midwest, to train wreck inebriated honeys that apparently got passed over from the reject reels of Girls Gone Wild (I actually saw a girl remove her underwear from her skirt in the middle of the restaurant........ and note that I'm not actually complaining about it...).  The sandwiches are very decent, and pay homage to NYC sacks. The only thing I don't like at Carnegie is the tunafish salad. It simply sucks. Not terribad, just not great, even for a deli.  It ain't cheap (what is on the strip?), so make sure you're hungry when you come in.",

I had just landed in Vegas, just dropped my things off at my hotel, and suddenly out of nowhere I NEEDED a chicken salad sandwich.  Who knows.  So sat here Yelping and trying to find somewhere but nothing was coming up, so I start searching my brain for sandwich places.  Carnegie!  Admittedly I had never been here before but I'd walked past it a million times.  So, quick check of the menu shows that they had what I was craving, so I walked from Flamingo to Mirage.  It was around 8:30pm on a Friday and there was literally just one person in front of me in line.  The man at the counter was very friendly, took my order (chicken salad sandwich on white bread), and I took a number and sat down at a table.   The waitress was very friendly as well and brought my food out super quickly.  As expected (I'd see photos of the food from this place...) the chicken salad was piled high.  And honestly?  This sandwich hit the spot perfectly.  It's that simple-but-delicious classic chicken salad, no frills.    The only downside is that it was a little pricey (my total for this sandwich & a glass of water came to $16.17)... but it's the Las Vegas strip, I'm not surprised.    All in all... great easy location, yummy food, nice staff.",

I was here pretty much under the same circumstances as back around 2010, after seeing the Cirque \"Love\" show and being hungry for a deli sandwich and the legendary Carnegie Deli Cheescake, but things seemed to have changed.  The place was practically empty as compared to last time when we waited 45 minutes for a seat.  The menu is also smaller than I remember as well.  My biggest sadness was the Pastrami sandwich, no longer that huge, juicy pile of pastrami that fed 3 of us back then.  Now, the pastrami drier and the sandwich smaller, it did feed 2 of us though.  The fries it came with were pretty good, they did come out hot and hit the spot.  The biggest saving grace for me was that the cheesecake was still delicious (but also seemed smaller?)  The Carnegie Deli Cheesecake recipe is definitely on another level.  Super creamy and dense with an almost silky texture.  I'm a longtime cheesecake maker and eater and can be somewhat of a cheesecake snob and wholeheartedly vouch for Carnegie's cheesecake...as good as the one you used to be able to get at the NY deli, it really saddened my heart when they closed last December.  I'm sure at some point I'll be back to see the \"Love\" show since I'm a Beatles fanatic and will surely not hesitate to stop by here for more cheesecake, I'll definitely pass on the pastrami but that's fine, probably means I can eat 2 pieces of cheesecake instead.",

There is nothing terrible about it but in a city with such amazing food options this Is totally average deli food. It's interesting that they have a sandwich named after Woody Allen because like the director, this place was probably more impressive when tastes were much simpler.",

You're going because you're hungry, you don't want to wait in some super long line and you're craving some serious meat.  It's also not going to set you back a million bucks to eat here. Is it expensive for a sandwich? Maybe, but you are in vegas, so just eat for another 5 minutes instead of hitting the slots and you've already saved money.  This place is exactly as advertised. A deli with big sandwiches. If that's what you're looking for, no need to go any further. Pictures say a thousand words, and with these sandwiches, my pics might say two thousand.",

Food here was a bit pricy but similar to other places in Vegas. We ordered the breakfast hot pocket to share (~$15). It's a special so not on their regular menu. It's basically a giant homemade hot pocket filled with pastrami and eggs. I wasn't too big of a fan because it was too soft and didn't have much texture but my boyfriend liked it. It came with a side of breakfast potatoes that was soooo delicious. I ended up just eating the potatoes instead of the main dish. Overall an okay place to eat.",

On the first day I went, they had lightly grilled the blintzes, which left them limp and the cheese inside undercooked. I was surprised to see them that way, but decided to try them anyway. That was disappointing. I went back the next day and asked them to deep fry them instead. They were happy to, and wow, what a difference that made. Crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked cheese on the inside. As I said, exquisite. I have attached the before and after pictures.  We also tried their potato pancakes and potato knish. The potato pancake was even better than what they used to serve at the Manhattan location! Thinner, crispier, tastier. Really good. The potato knish was huge! (Plan to share it.) It had a very light, flaky crust and had a really well spiced, very flavorful, and not too heavy potato filling.  It wasn't on the menu, but we asked anyway, and indeed they made chocolate egg creams for us. They knew what they were doing too, being quite generous with the chocolate syrup.  All in all, a very satisfying Carnegie's Deli experience (on the second visit), after the untimely demise of the original location.",

Next thing I noticed is you do get served quicker which is a plus, but frankly I miss things like matzah brei....the potato pancake was ok, maybe not quite cooked in the middle.   The pastrami was decent, although maybe a bit more in the salty side than it should be.   Pickles were ok, not quite crisp enough.   Portions still fairly large, although I seem to remember bigger.    I'd still stop for a quick bite, but miss many of the foods on the old menu and the old school waitresses that made it special....",

I stuck with the classic strawberry, and while our host couldn't answer if it was gluten free or not (\"Is there gluten in this?\" \"Gluten?

Have been wanting to try a pastrami Reuben here for about two years, and this was gonna be my opportunity!  At 10:00 am!  While I was extremely enthused about the sandwich, don't usually stretch my guts to capacity that early.  Will get to it-  Ambiance/Cleanliness-Well, it sure ain't like any of the delis in NYC that I grew up with....it's like a coffee shop/diner as filtered though Las Vegas functionality.  Clean....nothing very special....3 stars.  Service-The hostess was lovely, but when I ordered my sandwich, the manager said that they were out of pastrami, and I got fairly nasty, fairly quickly.  Magically, the necessary pastrami was located, and we were in business.  Food came out within 10 minutes of ordering.  Since they made it happen, something that should NEVER happen again....4 stars.  Food-One of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in my life.  It was superb!  My friends had breakfast food, and I can't comment on that, other to say, I don't see the point.  My Reuben?  Perfectly toasted rye, with a nice Russian/Thousand Island dressing, perfectly drained sauerkraut and a solid maybe 12+ ounces of delightful pastrami, hand cut with melted Swiss cheese on top.  It would make a fabulous last meal!  I'm subtracting 1 star for the price of $25.00.  That's steep!...4 stars  I'll be back for sure.",

I've had everything from the matza ball soup to the massive pastrami sandwich and it's about as good as it can get for being on the other side of the country. Love getting an egg cream and the macaroni salad is spot on. Service for me has always been fine. Will be back soon!",

We ordered to go and went back to our rooms to enjoy a nice quiet lunch since the restaurant was bustlin' with morning brunchers. Originally we were going to order just a salad and maybe an omelet, but I let my eyes eat and so the boyfriend and I decided to split the Woody Allen. I admit, its a sight or the eyes. The meat wasn't distributed well though. I had wished they had mixed the corned beef and the pastrami together more instead of one on top of the other. Luckily we asked for extra bread so I was able to make two sandwiches out of my half of the sandwich. Yes there was THAT much meat! The meat in general was pretty dry and lacked a lot of flavors. I barely finished it and saved my second sandwich for the flight home which looking in retrospect was a darn good idea. ;) I think it tasted better on the way home all soggy than it did fresh. I am SOO happy we ordered fries because it was probably the most enjoyable part of the meal! It was perfect shoe string fries, well fried and seasoned! Order this and skip the woody allen. Their menu is extensive so I'm sure you'll find something  We didn't get charged for sharing which I'm thinking is because we ordered it togo. Awesome! Just some food for thought!",

I had Swiss added and  asked for sourdough and it turned out to be the perfect combination.   My only issue with this sammy was the way it was layered. I get the whole 'big sandwich' theme going' on (I know they have a reputation to keep) but I've never been someone to get excited over a third piece of bread in the middle of my sandwich. The layering went like this, from the bottom up: bread, chicken salad, Swiss, bread, bacon, half a head of iceberg lettuce, one whole tomato. I promptly dismantled the thing and layered it the way it should have been: bacon and other toppings carefully crammed against the chicken salad and cheese and topped with the second (and last) piece of bread.   I will definitely eat here again and I won't have any problem putting a little work into the darn thing to make it perfect!",

There's like a pound of meat on the thing, and there's legitimately spicy brown mustard dripping out of the sandwich onto my hand, from both pieces of soft, seeded rye bread. I'm lucky I don't bite a knuckle off. The pastrami, cured and smoked in-house, is tender, flavorful, moist and marbled with fat. Yeah, it's not diet food.  Since Carnegie is open all night it's one of the best late-night options in town, especially if you're not trying to eat bar food or casino coffee shop fare.",

We liked our meal so much, we decided to return the next day.  Unfortunately, our experience the next day was just so-so.  This time my husband & I split a corned beef sandwich but the meat was extremely dry & chewy.  I couldn't even eat it.  I had a bowl of matzo ball soup instead and it was delicious.  I was really disappointed by the corn beef and based on the inconsistency, I probably would not return.  A Jewish deli HAS to do corned beef well and I don't mind paying the high prices if it's good but based on our experience, it's not consistently good!",

They are meant for giants from Harry Potter. I think Hagrid would go to town on this shit. When i'm in Vegas, the liquid diet commences and I can't eat much. When i say liquid diet, i mean i'm drinking a lot of booze. I dont' mean i'm starving myself to shrivel up like a supermodel. C'mon now, I love food! Anyway the portions are HUGE. Even if you try to order a regular sandwich like I did, the amount of meat they give you in the sandwich is at least 4 inches thick. I honestly cannot eat THAT much pastrami.  People who order the triple deckers are nuts. Has the guy from Man VS Food come here yet!?!? It's disgusting. Anyway.. the quality of the pastrami itself is sufficient. I ate about half the meat in my sandwich but I found myself dipping it into a lot of ketchup and deli mustard. I came back for breakfast because this was the only place close that wasn't a buffet. I had the 3 eggs [scrambled]w/ bacon from the breakfast menu. I think the eggs they were steroided out eggs or something because it DID NOT look like 3 eggs. It eggs took up more than half my plate and looked like at least 6 eggs. INSANE. The pickles however, would be enough for Snooki from Jersey Shore to cream her panties.",

The alluring scent of smoking meat from Carnegie wafts over the whole area and we've been eyeing to try this place for awhile.  Not being able to choose, we decided to do a sandwich and did a custom meat sandwich that includes 4 meat choices. So we tried the brisket, the tongue, the chopped liver, and the pastrami.   When the sandwich got to the table, it was shock and awe. It was something straight out of Man vs. Food in montrosity. That being said, was even that good?  The answer is not really. The brisket is pretty bland while the pastrami is surprisingly tough. The tongue is okay but really needed to be heated up with the rest of the meat-fest. The liver was well seasoned however with this sandwich - there was just too much of it to really enjoy any of it. As for the bread... what bread? It sort of gets lost in the shuffle amongst all the meat. But when you got a taste of the rye, it was rather dry.  Our service was okay. She was actually quite nice and gave us some extra bread to take home when we asked for a take-home container.  Curiosity satisfied we packed up the remains of our sandwich. It took me and the hubs 3 days to finish that monster. RIP mo-fo... you were one bada&*-kicking Sammy. 2 starred Godzilla sandwich.",

The pastrami was tender and moist , but the corned beef was a bit on the dry side.   We did add their spicy mustard to liven up the meat and tried their whole pickles which were zesty and tasty.  The corned beef was exceptionally lean with the pastrami being on the fattier side.  Nothing to get really excited about, but fun to try.",

No complimentary pickles.  No specials.  Waiter shamed us into our order-- \"are you sure you want two sandwiches, most people split.\"  The size of the sandwiches has always been part of the fun!

The first time my husband and I came to Vegas, this was where we went and I've never forgotten it. He food was delicious and worth the seemingly exorbitant price, and it was warm and friendly. A traditional sit down restaurant.   Now, it might as well have been turned into a fast food establishment and it has lost all of the charm that made it so desirable. I'm not going to stand in line and order and $18 sandwich at the counter, without being warmly greeted or treated like much of a person at all. The servers seem to have been forced to take on more than their fair share, and as much as our server was still really sweet, it seems like they have been run completely ragged. I'm sure their tips have been severely affected by the change, and that upsets me even more. You can really tell a lot by how management treats their employees. Forcing them to take on such a significant amount of work has caused a slow and decline in service.  If they ever decide to change back to a traditional restaurant, I'll be back. Otherwise, one of my favorite Vegas experiences has been ruined (I have my suspicions about mirage adding a new restaurant \"the pantry\" and wanting to make it seem more appealing) and I will not return. I'll likely never recommend this place,  either. There are too many great restaurants in Vegas to be treated like zombie cattle running through a line. So so very disappointed.",

    "text": "The food is Amazing!!! The service was HORRIBLE! So you order your food, get given a number and walk out to the dining area to find about 8 tables piled high with the plates from patrons long gone. Really? Nobody can wipe down a table? We literally had to stand and wait for about 10-15 minutes for someone to finally listen to us and clear a table. We asked the guy up front and he just said they'll get to it when they get to it. We tried to flag one of the servers down and they blew right past us. When they did finally clear ours. They didn't bother cleaning any other tables and so we had the entertainment of watching patrons go through the same thing we did each time until our food came out. Now the food was amazing, the Reuben, the Turkey club, the Pastrami, the knish, the cheesecake. All so amazing! But the only way I will eat here again is takeout.",

It is perfection.  Highly recommend. If you can, pack the leftovers. You'll wish you had them after a few hours in the casino.  The only downside is the smoke filters in and really takes away from the enjoyment of the lovely food. This seems to be the smokiest and unluckiest casino on The Strip.",

When my boyfriend and I found this hidden away in The Mirage, we decided to jump in and order some food.  The place was busy!  Although the seating area was at max capacity, the service was still pretty good minus a few blunders [i.e.  The boyfriend getting coffee when he ordered a soda].  Blunders are forgivable; especially when the place is busy.  So the boyfriend ordered some kinda of burger with a huge plate of fries [I don't know why fries aren't complimentary on The Strip --- not American!] while I stuck with the Meat Loaf.  Portions are gigantic --- just like the hype!  Too bad everything tasted bland.  The thing that makes me give it 3-stars though is dirty utensils.  I don't care how busy it easy.  Dirty utensils at my table and all surrounding tables is NOT OKAY!",

We seat ourselves and we were finally greeted by a very wonderful server named Sandra she read off our order and Dorian had put the wrong sandwich down Sandra took care of everything with a smile always checked on us and saved this experience. I am in the food industry so I understand but when I spend $80 on mediocre food for 3 sandwiches  I expect the attention to detail to be on point...it's not like it was before I would have gladly spent $100 but not anymore  and to pay for parking  on top of it? Cut us a break... the only reason I gave it 3 stars is for Sandra...",

The Spanish casheir tream me like trush( I say spanish base on her appearance and accest).   I stand there about 15 min wait for service, while the cashier busy talking to another employee, then she end up help another couple who come behind me.  Anyway, after I order my food, she asked for my ID, because I told her to charge to my room. That was fine for me, but the other customer who did the same thing charge her bill to her room, she didn't ask for her ID.   She put my food in the bag like trush. I have to ask her to warm my food, and even ask to put in a container.   I was at the same place yesterday and order the same, and the service was very nice.   Although I stay at The mirage, but I believe this is my last time to eat Cargegie deli.  Your need to give your staff proper training. Also they need to be reminded to lieve their person at home",

We split a order of fries and the turkey club and it was more than enough. It was a good turkey sandwich -- especially considering the size. We likely wouldn't ask out this place to eat had we not been staying in the mirage - but it was good for a late lunch. It's very pricey. Since we split the sandwich it wasn't too bad -- but I'm sure we could have found better/cheaper sandwiches on the strip.. Had we not just wanted something close.

I knew a Woody Allen would be expensive (it was nearly $30 by the time all was accounted for). Yes, it was a good sandwich with a lot of meat...but NOTHING like the pictures of the sandwich they post. See my photo for the comparison. I get that Vegas is the city of dream and illusion, but some truth in advertising is still called for.",

    "text": "I stayed at the Mirage the last time I was in Vegas and Carnegie Deli was the perfect place to run for a quick, but satisfying meal!  I loved how the restaurant imitated the NY deli, from the fresh food to the cafeteria-like dining room!  The prices are much higher than you would expect, but that is consistent with the rest of the food in the Mirage and other Vegas hotels.  Carnegie has a register and menu at the entrance where you order and pay.  You can order your meal to go or you can sit in the deli dining room and have someone bring your food to you.  The dining room is comfortable and casual.  The sandwich portions are massive.  I couldn't even finish one half!  They had several choices available for a \"Make Your Own Deli Sandwich\" option.  My favorite sandwich was the roast beef and cheddar cheese on whole wheat bread.  All of the meat, cheese, veggies and sauces were fresh and delicious.  I also, surprisingly, loved the Matzo Ball soup!  I didn't really know what to expect, but it was really good!  Although I did not try it, the Reuben looked phenomenal as well!  In addition to lunch and dinner, Carnegie has a decent selection of breakfast items on their menu.",

For most delis that would work, but for a deli that I located at the Mirage casino it just can't happen.   The food is good! It's very tasty-  The sandwiches are big.  Their shnitzel is crispy and good. Their turkey sandwich is yummy. Their matzoh ball soup is just like grandmas.   One of the best parts is actually the service!  Super nice friendly servers will do ANYTHING to make you happy! Especially Pam- she did a fantastic job!  And been doing that for years!   Another cool thing about this spot is that they give discounts to locals!  And this thing can be an issue because this place is expensive!   So overall it's a good place! Not the best deli I've been to, but tasty and super friendly staff. Too bad their expensive!   Trust me. I know food!",

My local friend got shafted on that. May that be a lesson to always ask about locals' discounts!!! We all had the hot dog and with the addition of mustard, mine was quite tasty and filling.  You can always choose a giant sandwich to split or other deli staples here as well. Service time was quick and I guess we got lucky that it wasn't packed.",

But why on earth did they change the format from sit down restaurant to order from counter and grab a number and find a seat?   I agree with other reviews here, it certainly has lost its appeal, even though their sandwiches (just get corned beef or pastrami; rest are average and all feed an army) are the same as is their breakfast, just like how I remembered. Pantry's smash Browns kicks butt over Canegie hash browns though.   I guess one good thing is you don't have to pay tip or do you still have too with its new format? I left standard 15%.

Definitely stop by here when your stomach and your wallet needs a break from fine dining.  *** update 3/27/08 I had to take off 1 star for service this time.  The bf had a craving for pastrami so we came a little around 1 am.  The servers were unfriendly, a bit understandable for 1 am, but I was disappointed.  I also ordered a potato knish, which is huge.

Soup sounded like the ideal late night snack, and when you think soup, how can you not think Matzo ball? So, we arrived and ordered this potentially brilliant treat.  In the meantime, my husband was trying to find out if their bagels were True New York bagels. Our waitress had little idea, and my husband got up to ask the hostess. She said, \"Everything is just like in New York.\" However, about that time, the chef showed up and said the bagels came from Great Buns. I doubt the bagels are going from Great Buns to Manhattan. The whole bagel episode frustrated me.   Then the soup arrived. The Matzo balls were giant and yellow-tinged. The broth came on the side, and the waitress ceremoniously poured it over the lurking balls. That was the most exciting part of this experience. There was not a morsel of chicken to be found and not a single vegetable, not even a carrot sliver! After my first slurp, I pronounced the broth flavorless, but then my husband took a sip and said he kinda liked it. So, I continued to ladle it into my mouth. Honestly, however, it was pretty flavorless and an unappetizing shade of yellow.   I thought I may be in a mood, so I decided to snap into a pickle, as pickles generally make me happy. However, there was no snapping to be done. The pickles were as mushy as the Matzo, and the flavor was the most insane combination of salty and sour. It was an insult to pickles. It made me want to cry. It was late.   I was tempted to give one star, but out of all fairness, I only had soup and a bite of pickle. Still, I am not sure I would trust a place that can't impress me with those two simple items. Better to save my New York cravings for New York I guess.",

Just be careful what you order and make sure you're on the brink of starvation, the portions are insanely massive. You get heaping mounds of meat in your sandwiches, almost to point where it's laughable. I ordered the Reuben that was super delicious. The only annoying thing was that I had to take almost 3/4 of it to go because I was so stuffed from eating the 1/4. So I ended up having to lug around 3 lbs. of meat all over the strip in a doggy bag. We didn't have a microwave in our room either so after it went cold it wasn't that great the next day. It had become a coagulated pastrami and cheese brick. Pretty nasty, ended up just throwing it away. For a $24 sandwich that kinda sucked.",

The friend who recommended Carnegie warned us that the portions are huge and she was NOT joking.  The sandwiches are mountains of meat that can easily feed a small country.  We had the Brisketball, which is topped with turkey and brisket and the Woody Allen which is topped with pastrami and corned beef.  Each was absolutely delicious.  Plus, Carnegie has a wonderful spicy mustard that complements their sandwiches well.  If you're eating at Carnegie be sure to come hungry and bring some friends because these sandwiches are not for the faint of heart.  My only regret is that was too full to try one of their cheesecakes.",

They pack their sandwiches like a mile a thick full of meat so of course they're going to charge you if you decide not to get anything else and share it. Fries aren't included!  I ate at Carnegie probably a total of three times on my last visit to Vegas. Their home fries are THE ISH and I'm not even exaggerating. I was seriously considering getting them for dinner but I thought it would be too weird. For breakfast, I've had the mushrooms & onions omelette and the fried onions omelette. You get your choice of bread (or bagel), and home fries or french fries. GET THE HOME FRIES. I don't know what kind of magical excellent crack they sprinkle on those things but they are the most excellent home fries. Their omelettes were huge. I was able to divide them into two meals both times.  The onions were sliced thick and you could tell they were fresh.   Their combination matzoh balls and noodles soup was a pleasant experience. This was the first time I've actually tried a matzoh ball. It's on the plainer side but it reminded me of a mixture of tofu and ground beef all mashed together to make this healthy tasting meatball. They serve it to you in a plate and the soup is served separate. Once they serve it to you is when you should pour in the chicken broth and mix it all together. Very cool! I appreciate them taking into consideration the potential mushyness the noodles can get if the noodles and soup were served together. They portioned this just right. I was satisfied in the end.  Although I frequented Carnegie on my last stay, I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to come eat here. It's just A-OK in my book.",

Upon sitting down, you receive a plentiful bowl of pickles that provides some great snacking. After seeing the massive plates around us, my dad and I decided to split the Reuben. They do charge you a couple extra bucks to split a meal, but when you're not taking any leftovers home anyway its definitely worth the savings. We substituted the corned beef for pastrami, and the open-faced sandwich took up the entire plate. It was absolutely delicious. The potato salad wasn't bad, but nothing homemade.  The prices look a little steep at first glance, but once you realize you can eat for days off of one meal it makes sense!",

The quality of the food was average and the service was less than optimal.   We weren't able to sit near each other but after a little while, a table became available so we scooted over to be with the other couples.  At that point, the manager came over and told us we were going to be charged a mandatory 18% gratuity.  All we did was switch places to a table that someone else had!  When we told her the situation, she said it was mandatory and she would adjust all our bills. When we didn't hear back from her for approval (we paid via credit card), we left a cash tip.  As we were leaving, I decided to check our bank account (I didn't really trust the manager) and found they had, indeed, charged us extra without our approval. When we brought it to her attention, she was belligerent, quite rude, and spoke to us like we were stupid (\"let me see if I can figure out how to say this nicely in words you will understand\"  -Both my husband and I are business professionals and gave her no reason to question us otherwise.).  She then said she would 'fix' it since we left a cash tip and guess what?  She did.......not.  We now have to contact our bank since they charged us twice at the original cost and another additional charge that included the unauthorized added gratuity - a total of approximately $120 for two sandwiches.   I will never recommend nor go there again!",

The portions are perfect for the glutton in all of us but unless you plan on going right to bed don't try it.   3 stars only because I gave four stars to a place the other day and it was filtered.

Although they do have other items on the menu that cost less, but since your here might as well get what they are known for.    They are known for their mountain high sandwiches.  I mean what i said \"mountain high sandwiches\".  You get tons and tons of meat it's crazy.   It's really hard to finish so I suggest sharing one.   I ordered the Woody Allen which is piled high with pastrami and corn beef. I would say it's good but after awhile it is a little too much. They have a variety of other sandwiches but you can order in moderation and not get the really big sandwiches.",

Decent corned beefed piled high, loaded with melted swiss and flavorful sourkraut, all atop an afterthought of rye bread.    However, everyone elses dish had me shaking my head.  The others in my party had the Woody Allen, the cheeseburger, and a turkey club.  The Woody Allen was little more than what appeared to be two pounds of meat with a couple slices of bread tacked on the ends.  That would be ok if the meat was some of the greatest stuff on earth, but it was far from it.  Dry, dry, dry.  THe corned beef, which was acceptable on the rueben, without the addition of heat is not nearly as good.  When your sandwich consists of a grotesque amount of meat and nothing else, at least make sure the meat is good.  The turkey club was piled high with DRY turkey, what appeared to be 80 slices of bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  That was it.  Same as the Woody, if you're sandwich is just going to be a showcase for a pound of deli meat, at least make sure the meat is worth showcasing.  The burger was plain and unforgettable, if at least a normal portion at a 1/4 pound patty.  For four \"sandwiches\", two drinks, and one order of cheesecake our bill was $120 without tip.  Can't say I'd ever really feel the need to go back.",

Luckily I had a condo, so I was able to take home the leftovers. I also ordered a side of coleslaw & it was perfect. Nice balance & not too creamy. Wasn't a fan of the pickles though.

Minh and I needed some food in our bellies for a night of drinking. The take-out line was kind of long as we waited to place our order. After looking over the menu and waiting our turn, it was time to order. Now this is not just your typical deli where your sandwiches are on the smaller side. This deli packs on the meat, which means these babies are freaking huge, more than enough to share!   We ordered the: Turkey Sandwich- Turkey, tomato piled high .You put the condiments on when you get the sandwich.  Found a comfortable spot outside of the restaurant (well actually it was the outer lobby and it was on the ground but heck I was sneaking in a couple of sip of my drink that I had)!!  Our friends joined us a moment later with their food as well.  People watching is a must here (it was NYE so the place was hopping).   After putting a little bit of mayo on my bread, I realized that my mouth could not possibly go around this huge sandwich. Darn, I had to disassemble it and eat it. The turkey was tender and not dry the mayo made it that much better.   I was half way finished when I just couldn't possibly fit anymore into my small tummy. Handing it on over to the boyfriend was the best idea ever! As he was more than happy to finish the last couple of bites of my sammich.  The prices are a little high here but just think about it, you get a lot of food for your money plus you can always use your \"M\" life card and get points!!!!",

I would definitely recommend getting breakfast instead of a sandwich here. Everything is just WAY WAY WAY overpriced and not worth it! At least with breakfast you can get more bang for your buck!  Breakfast is served all day I believe but the breakfast menu is only available at the register when ordering. So if I were you, totally disregard the hanging menu and save yourself and your wallet the agony.   One thing was the service! I dont know how much you would tip for TO GO, but apparently $2 isnt generous enough? I'm sorry I didnt know you had service all the way up in our suites?! When ringing me up for my food, the rude dude at the register made a comment along the lines of \"$2 only?!\" as if in disbelief! I asked around my friends what they tipped and some tipped $1 and some none at all?! Excuse me?! I'm sorry but it most places TO GO doesnt require tips because the only service Im getting is you passing the food to me!  How about I just give you a pat on the back for doing your job?",

A little disappointed that the waitress only filled our drinks once throughout the entire lunch we were there, but the sandwiches were pretty good. I ordered the Woody Allen, which was a humongous 1.5 pound sandwich of pastrami and corned beef. Under normal circumstances, I would not try to eat the entire thing in one sitting. However, a man in a cowboy hat sitting in the table next to me looked over and commented, \"There's no way you can finish that.\" And of course my stupid pride kicked in and I tortured myself to prove him wrong. I felt extremely sick and on the verge of exploding taking pained bites out.   The corned beef was dry and somewhat flavorless, but the pastrami was moist, full of flavor, and fatty. I wished I had ordered a full pastrami sandwich instead because the pastrami was so good. I had to drown the corned beef in ketchup and mustard to add some moistness to the meat.   $25 for a sandwich is a hard sell, and I probably will not do it again, but I will be happy to have their pastrami again next time.",

To eat:  French toast was not cooked completely and was raw on the inside. Coming from a European background I wanted to give their potato pancake a try don't do it! The pancake was very hard, and lacked overall flavor, it can be served with applesauce or sour cream I chose both but not worth the price.  Dirty dog: too much to even bite, the dog itself was great but the bread was dry.  The sandwiches here are what saved the day, you can truly feed two hungry people with these, they're really large but nothing special.  If I were you I would save your money and walk right across to California Pizza Kitchen for better food and service.",

( good luck finding one at all, and if you do, they all dirty)  My husband and I decided to share to woody Allen sandwich before going to a show with a side of fries.  Yes, the sandwich is perfect to share, was pretty dry, not juicy like we have had in the past.  And they only give you one pickle per person, while at the other locations , you get a plate of all different flavors to taste.  We also ordered two waters with lemon, no lemons came with with waters.   So over all I would like to give 2.5 stars. For there service and price.",

My wife had the corned beef sandwich which was loaded with meat. The meat was a little dry which I find is pretty typical for corned beef.  I also had the matzo ball soup which for $5.99 was very generous with two large matzo balls. It would have been enough all by itself as a light meal.  We saw a couple of the pastrami reubens go by which looked enormous. I don't see how anyone could finish one given the amount of meat and cheese included.  Service isn't great, but didn't mind ordering at the counter.  Four stars overall.",

Large portions are the name of the game here and the deli meat is brought in right from NYC.  The restaurant is located right on the casino floor so there is good people watching.  You order at the front counter and can dine in or take your food back to your room.  There is a large seating area with waiter service if you decide to stick around.  I have had the corned beef and the turkey club here and been very impressed both times.  The sandwiches run north of $20 each, but can feed 2 people.  The corned beef is pretty lean and has a great spice to it.  The turkey club was good, but dry with almost a pound of bacon on it!  The bread is sturdy and helps you get all that delicious meat into your mouth.  They are big and messy - a perfect end to your night in Vegas!",

If you're in the mood for good pastrami sandwich and some giant, creamy cheesecake, this place for you.   Their portion is huge so don't over order but share. You could probably share the cheesecake with two or more people. The pastrami sandwich was the best ever. It's served over light rye bread. The pastrami meat is bright pink, soft, and thinly sliced. It's not juicy, not chewy and not overly peppery but it's perfect to my taste.   This is not full service restaurant. You order your food at the counter and you get a number and they'll bring it out. The servers here are very personable and friendly. They do recommend you don't order too much and waste food. But make sure you leave some tips for them. They do work hard.",

Horrible!  Don't like it at all-feels like a Fast Food Joint.  Even though there was a small line though, it still took about 10 minutes to order our food!  We seriously missed the personal touch of interacting with a waiter, being able to ask questions, or being prompted about what to order with what, etc.  Their corned been sandwich and matzo ball soup are still great, but we did not like the new format at all!   Awful...You don't get that personal service.  The Mirage now has a new Cafe-style restaurant called the Pantry, open 24 hours...  I can see that business is now going there.    I wish they would change back to having waiters take your order at your table.  We may not come back..... we were that unhappy with the new system.  Is anyone from Carnegie reading these reviews????",

After I ordered I realized what line I was in and asked the persons behind the counter if I could eat in the restaurant. There was roughly 23 open tables and no line behind me. They told me I couldn't dine in and had to eat my food elsewhere. $35 for soup and a sandwich. It was laughable at this point and I asked why I couldn't eat at a table. They said those were reserved for customers who were in the dine in line. Nothing could be done? They would not let me eat inside. So I ate in the sports book, that's where they recommended I eat. The sports book was closed, throw a little more salt in the wound Mirage!",

Unfortunately, I thought it was just a little bland for my liking, but I have a major sweet tooth.  The diner situated inside the Mirage casino floor is a little odd, in my opinion. I don't feel that I got a True diner experience since I could still hear the pings/dings of the slot machines and still smell the cigarette smoke since I was technically eating my cake in the actual casino.  Question regarding the Vegas hotel/casino themes: why is Carnegie Deli in Las Vegas located inside the Mirage? Why is it not inside New York New York?  Even though the cheesecake was a nice afternoon treat, the next time I'm in Vegas, Carnegie won't be on my list of places to visit.",

My guess is because of the new Pantry restaurant they didn't need all the servers so you walk up to the counter, order and someone brings you your food.  that would be fine if the food was good.  We went for breakfast because we were tired of the Pantry and it wasn't good.  Both my husband and I ordered omelets, plain old cheese ones.  How can you mess those up?  Well you can.  Normally a cheese omelet has cheese inside, these just had melted cheese on top.  The potatoes that came with them were cold and my toast had no butter and there was none on the table and I could never find the one server to ask for some.  Maybe their lunches are still good but we certainly won't go back for breakfast again.",

You pay at the counter & then they give you a number. They'll then bring the food out to you when it's ready. The line to order food takes a long time though. There was only 3 people ahead of us but it took 20min for us to finally get to order.  Our order: Reuben: $19.99 Fries: $5.99  Having been to Katz in NY, this place is no comparison. The pastrami is sliced deli thin so it made it more dry. The Reuben can easily feed at least 2 people. The fries that we ordered were nice and hot and came unsalted.  Didn't feel the food was worth the price taste-wise but definitely good for sharing. No real desire to come back.",

To the people that call this place a rip off you are completely wrong. I dare those people to try and go to any store and purchase 2 pounds of HIGH quality pastrami and corned beef, if you can get it for under $25 I'll be shocked. The Woody Allen is not only a massive stack of meat but a very tasty sandwich. The Turkey Bacon club was equally as impressive in size and extremely flavorful.  If you are on the edge about this restaurant go, spend $25 on a giant sandwich and split it two maybe three ways and enjoy.",

I don't know if I'd wait in the line is it was more than 30 min long. Yeah, I probably wouldn't.  The Reuben  ($19.99) Supposedly the best pastrami in the world. I had to see what the hype was about. I asked the guy taking my order if it's big. He said \"Eh, it's about yay high and it's an open sandwich.\" He practically made it seem like it was going to be just enough. This thing is so damn big that when I got my sandwich, my jaw hit the ground. Share with someone. This thing is impossible to finish. The roast beef was very good though. Tender and juicy.

This clearly was an issue that could've been handled after everyone was seated--I actually flagged a waiter over and got seated on our own.  Ok fine.  Next issue, the food.  My chicken sandwich was not a fresh, grilled piece of chicken, but instead a rubbery and warmed up piece of meat.  That would've been ok (I could've doctored it up with cheese and condiments), but it's the price per quality factor I have issue with.  If I'm going to pay $16+ for a chicken sandwich, it had better be fresh meat.  Two mediocre sandwiches and a side of fries was $42???? Uh, no thanks...",

I thought I was amusing how the hostess told us it would be a five minute wait even tho about 1/3 was less than of the restaurant at most was full.  I ended up getting the matzo ball soup and he got the salami & egg breakfast sandwich.  The matzo balls were huge but good and filling.  I was surprised and disappointed though that it was just the balls and chicken broth, no veggies or chicken.  There was an option for noodles to be added but that would have made this bowl of soup $12.  Good but stingy with additions for the price tag.  His salami and egg sandwich was just okay nothing really special at all.  We also didn't like how they diced the salami up so small!    Service from our waitress was fine but the food was not so great and with other late night dining options on the Strip, there's no need for people to come here unless they really want a NY deli style sammie or they're too lazy to go elsewhere (like we were).",

The server lady had no idea what the soup of the day was. She was kind of nutty in her response and made us feel like she was in a hurry. Much to my disappointment the food was horrible- we sent it back because it was cold. I also found the prices to be out of line with the lack of quality. With so many options in Las Vegas, I would not plan on returning to this place. They nickle and dime you.",

I ended up eating about a 1/4 of the entire sandwich: made it through the corned beef on one HALF of  the sandwich, and couldn't eat any more. I didn't mind paying $20 for a sandwich-- you can't be too frugal on the strip -- but wasting all that food was just a shame. You can split sandwiches for a $3.50 plate fee, but the fact that they don't have anything smaller than 1lb. of meat on a sandwich just doesn't make sense.   What I did have was delicious, and service for us was decent, but out of control portion sizes mean I won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Years ago, one of the Vegas magazines had an article on the delis there. The picture I always remembered was of the biggest pastrami or corned beef sandwich I had ever seen in my life.  More recently I was excited to find out that the picture was from the Carnegie Deli, inside the Mirage.  I am a quantity of quality guy for the most part, which makes Carnegie Deli like heaven to me, since they have huge sandwiches that are also the best I have ever tasted.  If I go with someone new to the place, I will get the Woody Allen just to see the look on their face.  Normally, I just go with the corned beef on white. The free pickles are just OK to me.  French fries are pretty good. The cheesecake is decent.  The $3 charge to share food is pretty stupid.  You can just order the food to go and then eat it in the Mirage's pretty nice sportsbook area  Every once I a while I even seriously consider driving up to LV from OC just for the sandwich.  It may actually happen one day. Carnegie Deli is worth it.",

A little pricey for a sandwich until you see why. Cows.....Turkeys.....Chickens....literally most farm animals quiver when they hear that the Carnegie Man is coming. Carnegie man doesn't come for a thigh or breast. it strips the animal from all it's glory to pile unto these Kraken sized sandwiches.   Yes...I said it...KRAKEN.  It's freakin huge. Like the sandwiches Scooby and Shaggy makes when they have the munchies.  Ok so I had the Turkey, Tongue and Corned Beef.  Oy Vey....Sorry but do you want bread with that meat. Ok For those who remember those where's the beef commercials....steer them here.  The pickes were definitely kosher and GRreeat.  They also have this egg and pastrami sandwich! Mmmmmm Oh yea...Fanciful. It's a great hot sandwich.  Cheesecakes here are colossal....GINORMOUS....Definitely worth it if you're into sweets. Over all I had to ding it 1 star - because I want to eat a sandwich...NOT just the meat...where's the Carbs?",

    "text": "Las Vegas has attracted several famous delicatessens.  There are now branches of Stage Deli, Carnegie Deli and Canter's Deli.  Canter's is a branch of a famous Los Angeles deli; the other two are based in New York.  Carnegie Deli should have stayed in New York.  Their sandwiches consist of two regular size pieces of rye bread, with what must be a pound of deli inside.  Large bamboo skewers hold everything together.  If that's not big enough, you can order the Woody Allen, which combines corned beef and roast beef for an even bigger sandwich.  You don't pick up the sandwich, you lift off the bread and use a fork.  Sounds good so far, but the corned beef was dry and not all that flavorful; same for the pastrami.  At breakfast, I tried the matzobrei, pancake style.  It was just an omelet with a little matzo thrown in - very disappointing.  Their menu doesn't even mention sour cream as an option - you have to ask for it.  I really wanted Carnegie Deli to be good, especially because I've stayed at The Mirage a couple of times.  I kept trying, and continued to be disappointed.  Potato latkes were large, greasy, and crispy on the outside, but the potato was the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Cheese blintzes were OK, but not good enough to order again.  The only bright spots: a hot dog that was huge and pretty good; a chocolate chip cookie that also was huge, and also was pretty good.",

It took an hour to do a simple lunch on a Saturday, and most of that involved sitting at the table waiting for our server.  I dislike their pickles, which were too salty yet flavorless.  The latkes were the opposite - bland with no salt.   Also, my tuna salad's bread wasn't toasty and it had a URS.  Relish!!!! Why wouldn't they forewarn me???????? WHY?? I HATE relish! I have never had a tuna salad with relish in my life, and I aim to never have one again.  Maybe it would have been better if I ordered something else, but then again, how would I have known?

I want to ask if they sell bottled mustard, but so packed and loud get a headache here and everywhere else on this trashy-people-laced city.  Its $27 just for one sandwich, including 3.00 sharing charge (what bullshit is that) Based on just this sandwich, its great food, filling, you gonna pay about  50 bucks for two if you throw in 2 drinks and any side dish/appetizer/tip. Ordered side of fries they were gigantic and unneeded, in retrospect. Russian or thousand island dressing on side is good with this sandwich; the saurkraut needs to be put on the side-- it sticks to that mammoth melted slab of solidified cow piss.",

My cheese omelet also could have used more cheese. I also hate places like this where you order at a counter and the receipt when you pay has a line for TIP! Ummmm no! You are at a cash register taking my order. Yes they do bring your food to your table, but still. No thanks. Especially when our bill was just over $40 for not $40 worth of food. The man at the register seemed a bit annoyed, maybe because it was so busy, either way this place was just whatever.

The sandwixhes are basically a pile of deli meat (we had the pastrami) between two tiny pieces of bread (jsut picture a slice of wonder bread sliced diagonally) and that is it.  They serve a side of pickles.  The fries were a la carte.    Now don't get me wrong, the pastrami was quite delicious.

While waiting for our order we got a small bowl of pickles which I think they make since they tasted homemade.   When we finally got our food, both our mouths drop with the sight of these colossal mounds of meat. We added a little spicy mustard and went to town!  I would say half a sandwich would get you full. Anything more is way too much. But for 16-21 bucks a piece you will have two meals.. at least.   This is a Jewish deli so all the regular Jewish eats are on the menu as well. And of course, top off your sandwich with a Dr. Brown!",

    "text": "For some reason my husband was in the mood to go here.  With other delis so much cheaper in town, I have no idea why he wanted to go.  However, since I had a pleasant experience (albiet way overpriced) I was ok with this.  However this time, the food really did not live up to the last time we were there.  I was smart, and just got the plain corned beef on rye, lightly toasted.  If you get just one meat, the sandwiches are somewhat manageable, but I still took some of it home.  However, my husband had the \"pick your own meat\" sandwich, and it was larger than the woody allen, mainly because there was like 3 meats.  It was overwhelming.    On top of it, the meat just wasn't as juicy and delicious as I remember, it actually seemed very dry.  For the price they are charging this is pretty inexcusable.  I don't care if they are open 24 hours and in the Mirage hotel, this sort of bad food with the insane prices is just extortion.  For lunch, my husband and I, for just our two sandwiches, iced teas, and a piece of cheesecake to go, was over $80 bucks.  Yes, this is extortion prices.  If you're willing to venture off the strip there are better places to go.  Like Del Mar Deli (which I found out this week was actually Bagel Cafe), in South Point, or Weiss Deli in Henderson.",

FAIL #3  Ended up dipping my corned beef slices in Thousand Island (extra $3) sauce as my meal. FAIL #4 & 5  Overall...would I come back? HELL NO! Over priced Oscar Mayer!

The only downside is the price, obviously. It was expensive, and it was cold cut meat pretty much, so pretty raw, add your own sauce kind of thing. And yeah, they charge you a couple more extra bucks to share?! I don't understand the logic behind it.   But, the BIGGEST sandwich I've ever had in my life! I went and tried it just to say that I did. My favorite portion is the beef tongue Yumm. And the pastrami was good, also. I was pretty happy, though it does get kind of tiresome after a while, hence I was so tired of meat afterward. They had a lot of great options on their menu also, so something here for everyone! I like their diner style booths and their pies look amazing. It does feel more like a fast food restaurant than anything, so don't expect anything spectacular. Service was rushed, also, and pretty nonexistent.   But this review is for the sandwiches only. I would come back here for hot sandwich, but not the Woody Allen anymore. Just once in my life is enough. Is this place worth the price otherwise, though? Probably not. You're in Vegas, there's a thousand other better food places you can eat for the same price.",

For the wee hours, there was a good amount of people eating here. Lots of intoxicated characters too.  Lots of sandwiches on the menu here. I went with the chicken noodle soup. I was tempted to add the matzo ball too but it would've turned into an $8+ soup so I left that out. I was craving soup and it hit the spot. My friend who got the same thing agreed. I ordered the French toast which was very good. I only had a slice before my drunken-tired friend devoured the rest of it. It was probably a good call anyhow, it was late and I was ready to pass out.  All in all, this wasn't a bad place. It's not as cheap as it may seem. So if you're broke from the tables or have spent all your money in the clubs, make sure you have enough to pay for the meal here.",

I am pretty happy with this place since I can't fly to NYC all the time. And it doesn't hurt to be open 24 hours. Quick lunch or late night snack with people after clubbing at TAO or JET.   I have no complaints. Maybe a small workaround. Sandwich is 14.99. But to share you have to pay $2-3. Therefore, I order a reasonably priced cheesecake to eliminate the sharing fee. Cheesecake taste great and I don't have to pay $2 for nothing.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Sad to report, but it's going downhill. They have thrown the \"Carnegie experience\" out with the trash.  Carnegie Deli has been on my list of must-stop LAS restaurants for about 7 years. Since my last trip to Las Vegas in January 2014, there have been changes, all in a negative direction. Forget the old idea of table service. You order and pay at the register and take a number-stand so your food can be associated with your table. When you get to the table, the pickle tray is no longer there. When your food ultimately arrives, you are asked whether you want pickles, and if you affirm, three pickles are brought to you. While they claim the food is the same, and that it still comes from the plant in NJ, in fact the corned beef had a distinctive saltiness that I've never before encountered with Carnegie meat, and it makes me wonder if it's been out warming for too long and become a bit less moist than intended. The sandwich was massive and tasty except a bit over-salty. Just a bit. Still better than the corned beef just about anywhere else. One would think that all of this was designed to cut costs, but those savings sure were not passed on to the customer! Prices seemed to me up about $2, bringing the corned beef sandwich to $18.95. The cole slaw was great,  but the portion smaller than I remember. The plain cheesecake was perfect, and the only part of the meal that was unchanged.   This restaurant at the Mirage was dead at 2pm on a Thursday, and I think that's a first in my experience. Usually, it's packed.  The waitress said that the owner made big changes in October, 2014. If they don't do a course correction, I think Carnegie Las Vegas will become a casualty. That would be sad. I've really enjoyed visits here when I need my fix of Manhattan.",

The breakfast came out and it looked just like what you would get at a Denny's...nothing special at all. So besides changing the format the food and presentation is only mediocre. And did I mention they kept the prices the same. The sandwiches...while still bigger than a normal deli are half the size they used to be. And the meat quality is just not as good. I asked to see the manager and she claimed everything was the same except for their being no wait staff. She was trying to sell the company line I guess she was pleasant enough.

You know what, he was right, this was one of the best pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. It is pricy but worth it. Also had the cherry cheesecake and it was incredible.  One of the best I've had in a long time. I will be back for sure.",

    "text": "I would give the food one star, but I have to up it to 3 stars purely for comedic reasons.    So, we came here at like 2am one night this last weekend and proceeded to order some odd items.    Little did we know that they would take our odd orders and come right back and make it a millions times odder!  I don't think I've laughed this much during a meal in a LONG time.   I LIKE!  So, I had just eaten \"dinner\" a couple hours earlier, so I went for something light.  Cereal seemed like a safe choice.  They had some terrible choices (Cheerios, Cornflakes, Frosted Flakes, Raisin Bran, not good options!), and I figured cornflakes was probably the least offending out of all of those choices.  My other friends ordered toast and blintzes.    So, already it's like, yeah, that's some terrible and odd food choices we made right there.  Anyway.  We order, and then begins the oddness.  First up, the pickles.  We're sitting there, being silly animals as usual, and then the waitress comes by with 6 large pickles and just plops them on our table.    . . .  I like pickles too, but something about seeing nothing on the table but pickles made the situation really funny.  We started laughing.  And then it never stopped because here comes more:  Our food comes.  They give me my cereal on a PLATE with the milk in some sort of large half-and-half pitcher.    Um. . .  I flag down the waitress and ask her for a deeper bowl.  She says they don't have any bowls.  (WTF?!?!)  Er....so I'm supposed to eat my cereal off a plate??  She says she can give me another plate, and I'm like, um okay I'll take it because they gave me way too much cereal on that first plate.  I figured I could scoop some onto another plate for easier eating.  So, yes.  A giant plate with overflowing cereal, and milk sitting in the middle of all that cereal in a half-and-half pitcher.  With a side of pickles.  WEIRD!  Oh, and then we turn around and see that the guy behind us had this HUGE pastrami-looking sandwich that looked about a foot-tall.  We had to go and take pictures of that thing because it was truly monstrous.  He was a grown man, and he looked scared of it too.  My friend noted that \"even when he was finished with the sandwich, it was still 3896 feet tall!\"    AWESOME.  We went through our meal, laughing and shaking our heads.  By the end, the pickles were untouched, so I decided to give it a try.  I learned that pickles, dipped in apple sauce and sour cream (from the blintzes), are quite delicious!  Odd combination, but better than straightup sour!  All in all, one of the strangest meals I've never had, yet also one of the most fun and satisfying of my life too!    Thank you, Mirage, for your odd eateries.  I approve!",

There needs to be an acceptable proportion of bread and meat, not ALL meat and a bread as an afterthought.  That said, pastrami was a bit dry, cornbeef was good.  Service was excellent.

The Reuben... about two thirds the size that it used to be and with poor quality corned beef. The Pastrami sandwich... much fattier and less tender than in the past... and with a revised rye bread that is not good. The fries... a monstrous portion (enough for 4 people), that came to the table COLD!   The server tried very hard to please, and was the high point of the experience.

It was pretty good! pile stacked between 2 slices of rye bread, it so soo big I couldn't fit it in my mouth. Sandwich was smokin' hot when I first bit into it. As for the tongue part, it looks like thinly sliced pastrami and it's quite tasty. You can never go wrong of new things when you have the chance to. Service overall was realllyyyy slow.    2nd time I came here, I only ordered a bagel with cream cheese. The Bagel didn't exactly taste like a bagel, tasted more like an english muffin. As for the cream cheese it wasn't so great, but at the same time I'm just spoiled with my Philidelphia cream cheese...BUT! the service was fast, I was eating with a few other people too.

The portions are gigantic and the flavor and freshness is unsurpassable.  I would love to give this place five stars, because the food is five star food.   Alas, the two major complaints about the restaurant cannot go unnoticed.  The service is very uptight and rude to not allow substitutions and to charge for every little extra ($3 to share a plate).  I'm a huge portion eater but for those that don't eat a lot a one sitting you basically have to share one sandwich and it just seems like an easy way to make a $25 sandwich a $30 sandwich quickly.   If you can stand the extra money I urge you to give them a shot, and this review is coming from someone who luckily is best friends with a former employee and has always been treated above and beyond at Carnegie... so, I try to be as unbiased as possible.",

It truly has the potential to be a really good and fun place but it just does not live up to the fame. The pastrami is has more fat and is not as tender as I am used to, their corned beef is cut so thin that it loses much of the flavor it had (or it possibly never had the flavor), the pickled herring is covered in way too much mayo (who covers pickled fish in may anyhow, a good dish turned awful!!!). It was just disappointment after disappointment. One of the key elements to a good sandwich, particularly an all meat sandwich is the bread the bread was awful to say the least, it was no better than a mid-priced loaf at a cheap grocery store. Although I had no quarrels with the matzo ball soup, it was quite tasty (although pricey). I will NOT RETURN for another visit.

The season veggie ended up being all carrots...I thought carrot were a year round thing? It's summer so I was expecting something nice like a squash or a mix of veggies at least. The grilled chicken was ok sized and nicely cooked. The mashed potatoes were steaming hot. What the meal lacked overall was flavor. It was just blah. They needed some spices back there. My friend got the open faced roast beef sandwich with gravy and confirmed the same. It was good, it's just bland. Also, on the sandwiches, unless you order with triple meat, the giant sandwich they bring out is mostly lettuce. So it's really not that much. And the service wasn't that good either.

When I go to Carnegie I can consume my weekly caloric intake in thirty minutes with no problem. They need to make longer toothpicks for the massive amount of meat stuffed into their mile high sandwiches. A classic New York establishment, right around the corner from Carnegie Hall is where I first found this restaurant, and I was delighted to know that I could escape (especially if I had already drank a lot and squinted my eyes) back to New York where I feel so at home. The service is good, and they bring me all sorts of things not on the menu that I sneak from the nearby California Pizza Kitchen nestled inbetween Carnegie and the Sports Bar at the Mirage. A little BBQ sauce and ranch on my huge plate of fries. Three deeply fried and crispy latkes soaking in apple sauce and sour cream. They're super busy after LOVE gets out, so hit it later and feed the machine before you hit Tryst where you work it all off on the floor (and in my case also on the pole).   It's perfect when I need to see huge mason jars full of pickles to bring me right back home to the East when I've been in Cali for too long and feel like all I've been eating are sprouts and drinking organic wheat grasses. The only thing is that even the pickle jars aren't real, they're an image on a lighted box. How appropriate considering not only are we in Vegas, but also at the Mirage, and that's exactly what this place is, a NYC classic mirage, but it does it's job nicely and fixes your cravings up well.

Again the server was great and she took the sandwich off the bill as an apology The new system also is confusing with regards to tipping - as you are ordering at the counter, we did not know how much to tip the server as it does not merit the standard 20% we normally leave, as there isn't really any service. In this instance we did leave 20% as she was very helpful and apologetic. The staff don't seem too happy with the new system either as I am sure they are losing money are not tipping them. The food itself was great, but it is not a cheap restaurant so would rather spend the $$ somewhere else and receive some actual service.  Not sure if coincidence but the restaurant used to be always really busy, but when we were there it was dead...Go back the old system please!",

However, looks were deceiving.  The pastrami was tough, chewy and dry.  I didn't even bother to finish it, which is saying a lot from this pastrami fan.  I've eaten at the NY location a few times and it's always been a treat.  I didn't try their other famed items, like the soups or cheesecake, so I cannot comment on them.  They did look very good for what it's worth.",

Second, they're so ginormous, you don't even know how to approach the monster. It is thoroughly amusing to watch people's expressions as soon as the waiter/waitress brings them their sandwich and realize the size of these sandwiches. I considered sharing, but why share when I would get charged $3 (if I remember correctly) for sharing. So in my opinion, it is nothing special or spectacular. Maybe consider coming in late night once you're drunk; it seems like a good alcohol absorbing food.",

The food is a bit pricey, but I think it is actually cheaper than one would find it in NYC, so eat up!  ;-)  The portions are humongous, so you will get your money's worth, and no-- there are no half-sized sandwiches (I asked!...  I think they should have a half sandwich with soup, which is usually a staple in every other deli I have ever been to).  I recommend the basics: matzo ball soup, corned beef or pastrami, and a few pickles!",

Long story short, the food was mediocre and the service was the worst. I expected the pickles to be good. Not the case.  As for the service, the waitress never refilled our water or checked if everything was ok with us. So when it came time to pay, I did not want to tip anything at all. I wanted to just tip the leftover change to round up to the next dollar. The waitress wasn't happy and said we could keep the change. But for her to expect a tip when the service wasn't all that great baffled me. And to assume that that was all we were gonna tip her... I mean, what if we wanted to tip in cash?

    "text": "I am an honest to goodness Yankee, and yes I know this ain't even close to the real thing.  HOWEVER, this is one of my main go-to-spots in LV.  Here's why...  First, as anyone knows who has been there, walked past, or read these reviews, the portions are ginormously, astronomically, ridonculously huge.  This is a great thing to me, as I am inherently greedy.  Of course, it would be better if my hotel room had a fridge to store the leftovers, but I blame the hotels for that, not Carnegie. (Jury rig a 'fridge' in your bathroom sink or buy a cooler at CVS).  First time I went there, me and mom both ordered separate sandwiches, her the turkey club and me the prime rib.  Wrong move!  You should have seen our faces slide to the floor when they showed up and set them on the table.  We both literally had to peer AROUND our sandwiches to make eye contact.  Now, as far as prime ribs go, it was decent, but I honestly don't know what I was thinking in ordering it for myself, since I'm not really a fan.  Actually, I brainfarted and was thinking roast beef but that's my fault.  Anyway, needless to say we both had like 4 full sandwiches of leftovers to take home and for her to throw away, since she left the next morning.  So that's my first tip - split a sandwich, its so worth the extra 3 bucks or whatever to do so.  oh yeah, and go early in the day so you have time to eat those leftovers that night before they spoil.    Second time I went, I followed her move and ordered the turkey club, was smart and split it.  The thing is to ask for extra bread so when you break all that meat and bacon and stuff down you can make actual sandwiches, instead of open-faced halves.  With a little salt and pepper and some pickle juice it was golden.  I asked for bread when I left too, don't remember if/what they charged me but it wasn't much.    So to me, the place is great for the sheer quantity of food, even at 20 bucks a sandwich.  The 'rents went back again and my dad had the huge pastrami and said it was really good, and mom had chicken salad and also liked it (but again, get extra bread and prepare for how much you're gonna get).  One of the best things about this joint is the pickles on the table.  I'm usually having to hold myself back from eating them all (and really spoiling the appetite for the ensuing sandwich).  Also, another think I really like about Carnegie is you can get an old-fashioned egg cream here, which is basically like a carbonated thin milkshake.  So freakin good.....  The malt is good too  I'm glad to see that Carnegie is now open 24hrs, because the first couple of times I went they closed at 2am and I remember wanting a sandwich so bad after leaving Jet.  So I'll definitely be kicking off my heels in there next time I go the club, I'm sure it'll all be SO much better at 4am after the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol....",

I DID think it was odd that, at 9:30-10 am on a Saturday morning, the executive chef (that's what his chef's coat said he was, anyway) and one of the managers were eating breakfast together at one of the restaurant tables instead of... ummmm... working.  That is a former restaurant manager speaking, but whatever.  When we did get seated, we decided to split one of their HUGE egg and corned beef sandwiches, a fruit cup, and hashbrowns.  Fruit cup was great - mostly melon, but the melon, fortunately, was very sweet and flavorful.  Also had fresh pineapple and crisp grapes in it.  Pretty darn good.  Hashbrowns were AWESOME.  They had pieces of onion and a great seasoning on the potatoes... they were not just crappy and bland.  And I almost had an orgasm when I ate my half of the sandwich.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, the amount that they give you is completely absurd for one person.  But the corned beef... mmm... so greasy and meaty and good in the best of ways.  It only would have been better if it had been 3 am and I was drunk with friends.  I'm not sure it's ever socially acceptable to do a face-plant in food unless you're about 2 years old.  However, maybe it wouldn't be so frowned on at a drunk 3 am as it is on Saturday morning with your mom.",

I guess maybe I don't know what one is (since I always pan fry my latkes/potato pancakes, that's just how I roll). They weren't super greasy or anything, just not that great. Good with applesauce and decent with sour cream. This place is also a bit expensive. $12 for a plate of 3 latkes? Granted they were huge, but STILL, it's potatoes, a few onion bits & oil... How expensive can it really be? Ugh. Also, others at my table had food items that were way more costly than they should have been. Anyway, I don't really recommend this place. With all the other food options in Vegas, you can do WAY better for a cheaper price possibly.",

    "text": "As mentioned in my other reviews, we were staying at the Mirage.   We hit this place for lunch at around 2:00 pm, I've heard of the place however since I've never been to the original in NY I can't compare it. The menu says they charge $3.00 for plate sharing??, He ordered the hot pastrami on rye and ordered a plate of fries. The server placed 2 glasses of water and a bowl of pickles on table. I'm not really a pickle fan but I was hungry so they tasted quite good not to tart and very fresh and flavorful. Pastrami arrived and all I could say was OMG WTF it's a fuck-in pound of meat on two pieces of bread???, plate of fries arrive promptly. We spit the sandwich and fries. fries were your basic fries nothing specular no fireworks etc. The pastrami was tender, fat free, no grizzle and very flavorful. nothing like what I get at the delis or the Hat. We gave it out best to finish the pastrami, we both left about 3 bites and 1/4 lb of pastrami on the plate. Service from the day crew was great.  Damage: food $24.00, tax $2.00 tip $5.00   We also tried this place at 2;30 AM after a night of gambling,singing dancing,drinking and who knows what else. DH wanted the pastrami again. I opted for breakfast since it was the early morning hours so I got the eggs over-easy with fries (for DH) and wheat toast for me. Pastrami arrived promptly, for some reason they gave our water and pickles to the drunk gals next to us who ordered desert??? My over-easy eggs arrived scramble, i asked the female server if these were over-easy after much eye rolling, she said she be right back. My food arrived after DH polished off 1/2 his sandwich. Asked for a side of mayo to dip my fries in which arrived after I ate 2 eggs and my fries were cold. Sandwich was good, my $8.95 breakfast was not the best I've had.  Damage: $24.00, tip $3.00 off to bed to sleep for 3 hours before we had to catch our flight....",

First, my boyfriend's food came out before mine.  and 10 minutes later, after my boyfriend was almost done eating, my food still hadn't come out.  All I ordered was the grilled cheese.  when the waitress realized, she told me my hamburger was on it's way.  I had to correct her to tell her I ordered the grilled cheese and not a hamburger.  When she finally brought my food, she told me that the grilled cheese had come out, but she didn't see a tomato in it so she didn't think it was mine.  Funny, why would she then say my hamburger was on it's way?  Another issue is that she kept saying she'd get me more water after I told her numerous times I ordered an iced tea.  I can understand if it was super busy and that's the reason why she was making mistakes, but it wasn't.  Also, it cost over $40 for a turkey sandwich, grilled cheese with tomato, sparkling water (no refill) and iced tea.  If you're gonna charge customers that much money for a freaking sandwich, then at least provide some sort of service.",

We had just finished seeing Love, and were absolutely famished. Only a few steps away we see Carnegie. Was I dreaming? Finally, I was getting lucky in vegas! Lucky again; no wait for a table. And lucky one more time; a great waiter AND he was from BKLYN! A corned beef sandwich just tastes better when served to you by a guy with a Bklyn accent. Not even bothering to read the menu, we order a corned beef sand. Full well knowing the size, we decide to share one. That's the only way to save room for the strawberry cheesecake. I expected the food to be great, and it certainly was. What I did not expect was how completely authentic it was. Down to the half sour pickles on the table, and the chocolate eggcream! Carnegie came through with a perfect copy of their original; way to go! Yous are the best!",

I didn't get to try this place in NYC but here in Vegas, you can get any kind of food imaginable from anywhere. Anyways we were stuffed from lunch so we picked up something to go later in the night. One sandwich could easily fill the bellies of two. But since we weren't that hungry, we ended up with some leftovers. Luckily our hotel had a mini fridge and we were able to save some for the next day. We ended up with a pastrami sandwich. I was eyeing their most famous corned beef and pastrami combo sandwich but just thinking of the size of that and at $20, I just couldn't do it. Although the plain pastrami was already $17. Sandwich was fixed up pretty quickly and we were on our way. Oh and we got a choice of breads but  stuck with the typical rye. Man the 'wich was huge. No way could the height of it fit in my mouth.  But wow, really flavorful without being too salty. And moist too. Some fat in the meat too which is bad for my health but makes it takes oh so yummy. A lot of deli's have either really salty pastrami or dry, no flavor meat. This was a good balance. It also came with the necessary (two) pickles and the pickle really helps with a different texture and taste to break up all that meat you're devouring. Wow, not sure I could part with almost 20 bucks for a sandwich all the time but this hit the spot this one time. And you should splurge every once in a while, especially on vacation.",

Although, once our orders were taken the food was brought out quickly (although I had to sit and wait for her to bring syrup for the french toast). My boyfriend got an omlete sandwich, which he loved. Just about everything on the breakfast menu included eggs, which isn't so good for a girl whose #1 biggest dislike is eggs. The french toast, which was delcious by the way, was the ONLY breakfast entree without eggs involved. So, good thing I like french toast.   I probably would have given this a better review under one of the two following conditions: a) the service wasn't terrible (she even cut me off mid-sentance when I was ordering) b) I liked eggs and/or they had more than eggs on the breakfast menu  I've had the cheesecake from the Carnegie in New York and if they use the same receipe in Vegas, it has to be amazing.

T0 me there are three measures for a good (Jewish) deli. 1) Corned beef sandwich, 2) Roast beef sandwich, and 3) chicken noodle soup with matzah balls. I had #2. I asked the cashier (I ordered takeout) if the roast beef was rare (there is really no other way to enjoy it). She said it was. I took her word ... my mistake. It was well done with not a hint of pink anywhere ... it was gray-brown. To make matters worse, the meat had a mealy texture ... ewww. The rye was fresh though with a nice hard crust and soft innards. But I couldn't get past the meat. No kosher garlic pickles were included in the order? Why not? IMHO, rare roast beef should be bright red throughout and have a wet texture from being freshly sliced. Some \"blood\" (not really blood0 should remain on the plate if you put a slice down for a sec. [Bud's deli in Sacramento slices their RB in front of you, and it's absolutely perfect]. I may go back to try a corned beef sandwich or the soup ... but at $20 for my sandwich, it will definitely be a gamble (the restaurant is in the Mirage hotel and casino).",

My husband had his usual of the mile high Pastrami Sandwich, and I ingested two bowls of Matzo Ball Soup. Yes, two bowls... When you are that sick, the thought of eating on previous days was not appealing. All it took was that golden bowl of broth and Matzo to make me feel a little bit better for the day.

    "text": "I know $20 for a sandwich seems like a lot, but trust me....it is worth every penny.  Especially when it comes with 2 lbs of meat between 2 slices of regular rye bread.   I can never decide between the pastrami or corned beef because I love both so much, but Carnegie has the perfect solution--the Woody Allen. For $15.95 you get half-pastrami, half-corned beef. It will feed you for a week. My strategy is to take the top slices of bread and skim a few slices of meat to make a mini-sandwich, but believe me there is nothing nothing mini about it. Slather on some russian dressing and prepare your mouth for heart attack heaven.  This is the best pastrami EVER!",

The server asked if we wanted lettuce and tomato with our sandwich.  I said, \"Does it cost extra?\"  She responded, \"Honey, EVERYTHING costs extra here!!\"  She wasn't joking.  A plain roast beef sandwich and fries cost us $25!!  Officially classify it as a tourist trap.  Walk across the hall to BLT Burger and thank me later :)",

What's ridiculous is in order to split a meal with a friend, they charge an extra $3. No, you don't receive more meat, bread, or vegetables. The meat was way too salty and the wait was ridiculous.   Apparently they are supposed to model after the New York restaurant but it fails in comparison. We then got our pastrami sandwich and the meat was hard to chew, in fact it tasted a little strange. People here were very unfriendly, come on you're in Sin City, live a little.   People come here to gamble, go clubbing, and eat well. I don't think Carnegie would satisfy the eat well category. Compared to many restaurants in the area, I don't think it would be in my top 10.",

The guy clearly asked his lady, \"how hungry are you?\" After she gave my beastly meal one of those awkward over-the-shoulder \"Doot dee deedle doo I'm not looking at anything behind me\" glances, both got up and walked out.

I've had both the corned beef and the pastrami. Pastrami is much better. I had the corned beef hash too. It says comes with a fried egg. But when I ordered it no fried egg. The server then said that you have to actually request the egg specifically - even though it says it comes with a fried egg. I guess I should just be happy that it came with beef despite my not requesting it. Also it doesn't come with bread - so it's just a pile of chopped beef and oily potatoes. Pass.  Try the burger place across the way instead. If you're on a corporate account then I goes this is Ok.   Slow service, mediocre food and high prices make this no better than your typical mirage hotel restaurant.  Try to avoid unless you can't avoid it.",

Gillis the rudest person in this horrible restaurant never talked to me regarding the extra $2 I need to pay for the pastrami sandwich. The pastrami sandwich was dry, and lacked flavor also, but I ate it anyways because I was hungry, and did not want to talk to the horrible manager again. Then I seen that they charged me $17 for the pastrami, and did not refund my money for the salami sandwich that I did not eat. I called back Gillis, and she is not refunding my money for the sandwich. Very unprofessional. They stole money from me basically! I will be calling my bank to get my money back, but this should have never happened. Would not return to this place ever! Worst deli on the strip!",

    "text": "Like everything else on the strip, this place is very overpriced. The only good thing about this place is the pastrami sandwich. We ordered take out from this place twice. First time I bought a burger because I didn't think I'd care for the pastrami. The burger cost me round $16 with swiss cheese and NO fries. It was filling but had the same standard as a Denny's burger. My friends bought a pastrami and brisket sandwich. I tried both and only the pastrami was worth the money. We came back to this place later that night and ordered the pastrami, half roasted chicken, french fries, plain cheesecake and banana cream pie.   -Pastrami sandwich was delicious.  -Half roasted chicken was more like half roasted chicken breast in size. It was very dry and bland. We paid about $20 for this thing and it was NOT good. STAY AWAY FROM IT. The order came with what tasted like microwaved broccoli, just nasty. We wasted our money on this crap and could of gotten the $20 pastrami sandwich instead! -french fries were bout $4, they were OK but the serving size was small. -plain cheesecake, $6-$7. OK, but I've had better elsewhere. -Banana cream pie, I can't remember how much I paid for this but it was disappointing. I love banana cream pies and this one was not as sweet or creamy. Boo! Marie Cal makes better ones or Peter's Bakery.",

    "text": "Stays True to its NYC roots.  Lean, tasty pastrami and corned beef in fucktasticly big sandwiches.  The $16.95 Woody Allen sandwich is a pastrami/corned beef mix that might be bigger than Woody Allen's head (the sandwich is maybe 3 inches tall).  Highly recommend splitting the sandwich with someone else - even if they charge a couple bucks extra to do it.  Great horseradish tinged mustard.  Very good sour pickles.  They have a take-out spot that serves as a good fallback on busy sports weekends - you can just eat it in the sports book while watching the game.  So while this is NOT the place you want to be spending dinner in Vegas, it's a solid choice for lunch.  Especially if you don't live in a city with good Jewish deli.",

    "text": "Okay, why was there such a long wait?  We got so bored, we counted the empty seats in the place, and there were more empty seats than people waiting in line.  A former waitress, I thought maybe they were understaffed, but by time we were sat, they sat to capacity, so that confused me even more as to why we had to wait 20 minutes to be sat.  Our waitress took our order, but accidentally forgot to get my husband's.  It took us a few minutes to track her back down to get her to take his order, too, so his food came out later than the rest of us, which was kind of weird.  How do you forget the 4th person's order at a table.  Again, former waitress, and I don't get it.  That said, the grilled cheese and fries were fine.  I mean, it's grilled cheese.  I'm vegetarian so this wasn't the kind of place that caters to me, which is cool.  If you're into the meat, this is the place for you.  Their sandwiches were approximately nine inches tall, no joke.  It was unlike anything I've ever seen before.    I think I'd still like to try the real Carnegie Deli, though, because I somehow got the feeling this wasn't a good representation of the Carnegie name.  Service was lacking, wait time was illogical, and cleanliness wasn't the restaurant's forte.  I'll get back to you on all this after I check out another Carnegie Deli.",

    "text": "Not feeling it at all....  My gf and I were looking for a quick bite before our Cirque show that night at the Mirage. We decided to stop by Carnegie's since it looked cheap and quick.   First of all, this restaurant is dirty. The floors were sticky and the table had dried mayo/mustard stuck on it. To be honest, that kind of set the tone for the rest of the meal. Anyway, I ordered the egg salad sandwich ($7.95)and my gf ordered the turkey sandwich ($14.99). The server asked my gf if she would like cheese, lettuce, tomatoes or anything else on the sandwich. Without thinking too much about it, she simply replied with \"sure\". We also had an order of Matzo balls in chicken broth ($6.95).  The soup came out first and it was pretty tasty. For those of you who don't know, Matzo balls are these giant meatballs made of dough but without the meat. It was tasty and hit the spot after a long 4 hour drive  from LA to Vegas. My egg salad sandwich tasted funky. I couldn't exactly put my finger on what it was, but it tasted as if it might have been spoiled or rotten. My gf's turkey sandwich was monstrous. I took a bite and it tasted pretty normal for a turkey sandwich.  When the bill came, they apparently charged extra for cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. $2 for the cheese, $1 for the lettuce and $1 for the tomatoes. What kind of a restaurant charges extra for lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese on a sandwich? Aren't sandwiches supposed to come with these things? We ended up paying almost $20 for a freakin' turkey sandwich. The same kind you get at Subway for $6.   All in all, we paid about $40 for two sandwiches and a bowl of soup. I would give it a lower rating if it weren't for the tasty Matzo ball soup. If you are staying in the Mirage, you can probably find better alternatives to Carnegie's.",

Being a guy it's harder to get into clubs, if you did not know that. It was pretty crowded in there so we got one of the last booth seats so it was nice. We sat down at a waiter came to get us our waters. Then he also brought us some salted pickles. The pickles were REALLY salty. Well they were too salty for me anyways, but my friends liked them.   Then i got the pastrami sandwich on white bread. It was like $14 bucks....cough cough. I thought it was going to be a small sandwich that was good. And because i was in Vegas i expected it to be expensive. We did not expect the sandwiches to be so big. I tried to pick up the whole sandwich and i was stuffing my face.   After a good 5 mins i finished the first half. I had to use a fork to eat some of it because many of it came out of the sandwich and onto my plate. I could only eat about 3/4 of the sandwich by the time i was full.   The service was okay. It was really busy so it was kind of hard to get service and some more pickles. We were in and out of there pretty quick and we planned to come back, but we never did. Overall, a pretty good place if you are craving a pastrami or corn beef sandwich in Vegas.",

    "text": "1 pound of meat for $13!  4 of us ordered 1 pastrami sandwich and 1 corn beef sandwich + 2 basic salad. Free pickles when we sat down. One sandwich is enough meat for 4 people(we have some small eater in our group). Total cost for about $40. Pretty good considering  this is on the strip.  The pastrami sandwich is filled with meat, sliced thin and then stacked high between rye bread (very traditional). The meat has a hint of smoke, has good flavor with  a generous spice rub around the edge, but not too salty. A little bit of fat on the sandwich makes it juicy without being too heavy. I cannot help but compared it with Schwartz in Montreal. Schwartz's meat has more smokiness, while this is milder. Carnegie Deli's pastrami however a little more salty. I find mustard give a good kick to Schwartz's, but not needed for Carnegie's version. Both version are highly enjoyable.  The corned beef sandwich is also filled with meat, stacked high between rye bread. The meat is fatty but not greasy and not heavy. I am a little puzzled by how they achieved this...  The pickles are salty but not too tart. This is different from other pickles that I have. I cannot say I prefer it to ordinary pickle, but it is quite good in its own right.  The salad is big, but simple. We ordered that because we feel guilty downing 2 pounds of meat:)",

The individual parts were very good, but as a sandwich it ends up becoming a waste when you try to deconstruct it.   The corned beef hash is amazing. Potato cakes are strange - they almost have a hint of sweetness which was a turn off for me. Coleslaw is delicious. French fries are on the better side of standard, but you get a gigantic plate as an order - easily enough for three people to share.  Lines are long and service is slow so be prepared.",

Regardless of what you order, you will be bringing home leftovers.  Because of this, this prices are fine because it's as if you're buying two meals at once.  Carnegie, and the experience of the food, really depends on what you order and your taste buds.  I recommend the pastrami and/or corned beef for the best experience, and turkey if none of those intrigue your taste buds.    If you are in the area and want to fill up and not be disappointed, order one of their sandwiches.

Their Reuben is open-faced, which is very unusual (although we knew what we were getting), and although tasty, I missed the grilled quality of the bread.  The meat was also a little dry, and the sandwich skimpy on the sauerkraut and dressing.  Finally, while a decent size, for $25 I expected a larger sandwich, especially with all the comments about how huge this thing is supposed to be.  Sides were better than I expected - I'm usually disappointed with potato salad nearly everywhere I go (including Katz's in NYC), so this was a big plus for me.

    "text": "On the second night of my staycation with my brother and dad who flew in from New York, we were up for a New York deli. We decided on trying the Carnegie Deli, a restaurant I must of passed by a thousand times.    Carnegie Deli has the distinction of being one of those restaurants where a nice overpowering deli smell leads guests to the establishment. As soon as I walk in the Mirage I could smell the deli smell beyond BLT, Starbucks,  and the Sugar Factory. The issue is that everytime that I looked at their menu, the prices were overpowering. Today we'd give it a try.    There are two cues for Carnegie Deli. One is for take out and the other is for dining in.     The dining room is spacious.  The restrooms are outside in the casino. Throughout the restaurant are pictures showing the history of Carnegie Deli.     Carnegie Deli has a long history. It was established in 1937 at the intersection of 7th Avenue at 55th Street in Midtown Manhattan.Throughout the years they have received accolades. In 1979, NY Times critic Mimi Sheraton named Carnegie Deli the #1 pastromi in New York City. Years later, in 2009 Dr. Phil gave a shout out that Carnegie Deli makes the best sandwiches later. On March, 26 2013 I am giving a shout out that Carnegie Deli made the thickest pastrami sandwich that I ever ate.     The Carnegie Deli website claims that all of their sandwiches are stuffed with at least one pound of meat. Finishing the pastrami on rye bread was one of the biggest dining challenges that I faced in awhile. Part of the problem is that I am not crazy over pastrami. Especially the $17 price. Carnegie offers other sandwiches that include Corn beef ($17.99), beef or brisket ($17.99), chop liver ($17.99), roast beef ($17.99), turkey ($17.99), bologne or salami ($14.99), shrimp salad ($12.99), and egg salad ($10.99). If I return I will most likely order the shrimp salad sandwich. If they are serving me a pound of that stuff I will up my rating to 4 stars. With the sandwiches are pickles. All three of us shared a bowl of french fries-a grand portion indeed. For a beverage there is fountain Coke or bottles of Dr. Brown's soda.    Carnegie Deli's motto is that if you can finish your meal we've done something wrong. My motto is that when a sandwich costs $17, I am going to finish my meal. Unfortunately I was so stuffed that I passed over trying their renoun cheesecake.  That could be for another time.  The Yelp 100. Review 49.",

A pause.  \"Hey buddy, get to the back of the line if you don't know what you want\"  Vegas:  \"Good afternoon, what would you like to have\"  A pause.  \"Take your time\"  NYC:  Open the grease soaked paper wrapping and expose a four inch pile of juicy pastrami, brisket, or tongue on thin sliced rye.  Slather on the mustard.  Grab some pickles.  Get primal animal.  Vegas:  An inch and a half of over steamed, dry edge pastrami on thick sliced rye to keep your fingers clean.  Mustard in a squirt bottle and a pickle served in your personal dish.  An insult to the venerable institution that is arguably serves the best pastrami in the US (sorry, Katz's and Langer's).  Straight to it, post renovation in late 2014, things have changed.  Once known for crazy massive sandwiches with six inches of meat, a quarter head of lettuce, portions are now manageable.  All good as prices have also fallen.  They now offer a half sandwich, side and drink combo that a normal human can consume.  Great.   The menu is greatly reduced with many Jewish deli staples now gone.  Predesigned sandwiches with various meats are gone.  Sad yes, but the ultimate problem, the food isn't the same quality.  The legendary pastrami, while just as flavorful, sweet and salty deep beef flavor with the perfect oily mouth feel, has dry edges.  The brisket, suffers the same problem.  Pickles taste like they've been drained instead of being pulled fresh from a crock and brine.  While many times better than your local supermarket deli, it's just doesn't measure to past greatness.  The Vegas location never captured the True spirit of Carnegie Deli's NYC location with its gruff service and no nonsense, good eats, unfortunately the difference is now more than just its personality and geography.",

Unlike McDonald's,  the order taker completely messed up my order.  The the order came, it was wrong,  the quality has dropped significantly as well as the size of the sandwich  was much smaller.  The only bright spot was our server, Gabriella. She went above and beyond to make our dining experience  enjoyable.   I hope this is not the way the run their restaurant in NYC.  We will be scratching this restaurant off our must go to list for Los Vegas.",

The sandwiches used to be picture worthy and awe inspiring in their triple decker goodness but again, that was then.

While some of the dishes are not extremely authentic, the flavors are just good enough to give you a taste of the Eastern European and Jewish cuisine.  During this stay, I enjoyed a bowl of pierogi. Of course nothing comes close to my mom's homemade ones, but the flavors were not too bad. I didn't really like the dough, because it reminded me of the cheap deep frozen ones you can buy in a supermarket. But the filling was quite nice.",

The Woody Allen is a massive delicious corned beef and pastrami sandwich. The corned beef and pastrami are piled high here so sharing is definitely recommend. At $24 a sandwich I thought it was good, but just a little overpriced.  I am comparing this to Langer's and Canters in LA, definitely ranks #1 out of those three places so far in my opinion,  Fries were good, but nothing special. I ordered a Lemonade with my meal, and I don't know if it was because I was just thirsty, but it was most excellent.   Would definitely come back!",

Matzo ball soup with noodles and chicken - absolutely no chicken in the broth. Matzo balls were flavorless along with the broth. I had to keep adding salt and pepper to get any type of flavor here.   Potato pancake - also flavorless, and extremely greasy. Another salt and pepper showering.   Coffee - bland, waiter never came around for refills.   Cheesecake -  actually pretty good, but it was THIRTEEN DOLLARS for a disappointing size slice. If you're going to charge thirteen bucks for a slice, make it big.   We've been here before and the sandwiches are good, but also overpriced. I would only suggest coming here if you're in the mood for a traditional Jewish deli sandwich, and want to light some money on fire.",

Driving here from LA made us super hungry so we were happy to sit down for lunch.   Located near the sports book in Mirage hotel, is this small deli.  You order at the cashier and they give you a numbered table tent to place on your table.  The server will deliver your food to your table.  The 3 of us shared 1 pastrami sandwich, fries (ask for extra crispy, trust me), 2 chicken soups with matzo ball, and 2 soft drinks.  It was a whopping $50 but all worth it.  It was so much food, really.  Only 2 of us ate soup but us 2 could've shared 1 soup - the bowl and Matzo ball was huge.  Not sure how we ended up with 6 pieces of bread (we must've asked for extra bread) but we had enough meat to comfortably make 3 sandwiches - 1 for each of us.  Sharing is caring so don't be afraid to share!  That way you don't waste food.  Only bummer thing is the new parking rates in Vegas.  We were staying at Aria (MGM family hotel) but didn't bother checking in yet cause it was too early so we had to pay the $8 parking fee at Mirage.  Had we already checked in, parking would've been free if you park at any MGM property.  Daily parking rate for MGM hotel guests is $17 or $18 for unlimited parking at any MGM property.  If you have m-LIFE Pearl status or higher, daily parking rate is waived.  The food here is so good.  You have to come here to eat at least once!  In the end we were all happy with extra full tummies.",

It wasn't nearly as crowded as some of the other restaurants in mirage and it's probably partially because it's not in the main area. We followed the signs for the deli and found it. It's not entirely closed off from the casino but there's a short wall so you can still see out.   There was a small line waiting to order and it didn't take too long. The menu is above the ordering counter, on a screen and a written menu. You order and then get a number to take back to your seat and wait for the food. They also have servers that come to the tables to fill up coffees, bring waters and whatever else you might need.   The coffee was surprisingly good for being a deli/cafe type place in a casino. There was Dijon on the table and you can get cholula by request. Everything was pretty good and much better than the buffet. Not a bad place at all!",

I had to share it with my big brother and we were both full. I missed visiting New York but having Carnegie in Las Vegas was a special treat & I loved it!  Cheesecake yes!  Get that to go!",

Still, it was good to have their excellent pastrami again after all these years.  However, due to the three issues I listed above, I can only give the Las Vegas location three stars.",

No frills and probably wouldn't make the trip there unless I was with a Carnegie die hard or was already at the Mirage for something else.  The sandwich itself was just like the original with slightly softer bread.  Stick to the basics here and just get a sandwich and fries.  The potato pancakes were not a good deal -- $4 for something rather tiny made us wish we stuck to fries.  The matzo ball soup was okay, but not as good as I expected.

I was basically bone ass wasted on the first night of a five-night vacation when the alcohol surging through my veins instructed me that I was in serious need of a True NYC Pastrami. Enter Carnegie Deli at The Mirage.   The Deli itself was bright and packed (if memory serves me correctly). I barked out the words \"Woody Allen\" to the affable employee taking orders and I was soon handed a paper bag full of what felt like a bowling ball inside. I paid some other person roughly $20.00 and headed off to The Park MGM in order to eat (and sober up).  These portions are insane. This sandwich could feed a person three times over. That isn't to say it wasn't good. In fact, it was mesmerizing! After Katz's in LES, this had to be my favorite Pastrami in NYC before it closed to the chagrin of greater New York due to family infighting and outrageous rent.   Two pieces of rye are stuffed to their breaking point with soft, salty and oh-so-lush brined & smoked Brisket. This sandwich is absoultely NO JOKE when combined with the supplied Deli Mustard. Somehow pickles made their way into the bag which was a nice tangy change up to the saltiness and savory of the hot sandwich.   I ate twice what I should have and still had enough to last another meal. This Pastrami evokes great emotion. I want another right now.",

My husband got a western omelette with cheese. I believe the OJ is squeezed fresh because it was delicious. A large is $7, but no shocker in Vegas.  Our food arrived pretty quickly. My eggs were sunny side up, but 2 out of three still had some runny white parts, so I sent them back. They returned quickly and were perfect. The eggs were yummy, the potatoes had great seasoning and weren't greasy at all. My bagel was so tasty and the cream cheese was amazing. I realized I'd probably never had cream cheese that wasn't from Philadelphia's box, so I really enjoyed it. My husband said his omelette was really good and our waitress was very nice, so we were happy. I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "Worst service possible. This place must only be busy because of convenience to hotel guests. Took 30 minutes to get my food, though other people that ordered before me and directly after me got their food within 15 minutes. All the tables were dirty, sat at a dirty table and someone came to wipe it down 10 minutes later, no apology. They literally put a pile of meat on 2 half slices of bread and put a bowl with whatever side you order on the plate. This should not take 30 minutes. Brought me the food with the incorrect side dish, it was the wrong one, but no apologies, nor were there any apologies for the delays. Multiple other people had not received their food. The wait staff is running around like crazy but I'm not sure what they were actually doing since no one was getting their food and there were plates of food  just waiting to go out. They want you to tip at the register, and then give the server the receipt, I didn't tip at the register, preferring to pay cash after assessing the level of service. I'm not sure if this contributed to the service I received but from what I saw it probably did.  I ordered a cheesecake slice to go when I ordered my food. After 45 minutes, hadn't received it, and the waitress checked on the table next to me but never stopped to check on me, so I requested a refund, which they tell me will take a few days. Don't waste your money or time. Go to LVB Burgers, customer service was much better.",

As I was coming home from a night out on the strip,  I decided to grab a late night snack to take back up to my room.  I went with a pastrami sandwich on rye, which turned out to be a vacation changing mistake.   The sandwich came with a lot of meat and tasted okay, but it was definitely not worth the hefty price.  A few hours after eating the sandwich I was extremely sick, and remained sick for almost two days strait.  I was hardly able to eat anything during my remaining time in Las Vegas, and my sickness made it difficult for me to enjoy the final day of my vacation.    I will not be easting at the Carnegie Delicatessen & Restaurant again, and will look for better food at a more reasonable price the next time that I am in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Think of this review more as a 3.45 if anything.  I came to Carnegie some time back but before I was a religious yelper. When a buddy suggested we get sandwiches for lunch right when we got into town, I had no idea we would find our way back to this place.   All I remember are the portions are gigantic ($3 sharing fee) and at this time, I was thinking with my stomach than my head and ordered something solo (mind you, I had a MAJOR case of food poisoning the day prior so I was feeling like I was running on empty). I got the Woody Allen which comes with pastrami and corned beef.  When it came out, it was STACKED to the max. I forgot how to eat it. It went well with the deli mustard that sits at the table.   Disappointments this time around: - One of my friends got the beef tongue and said it was flavorless. There was nothing in the sandwich in the self that would make it \"saucy\" to eat... and the way this beef tongue was, there didn't appear to be any natural juices.  - The portion sizes are a bit wacky. A side of fries for $6 (which were cooked perfectly) was a pretty good size. For about $5 we also got a small bowl of potato salad and a small baked potato that didn't even come out with any butter, sour cream or chives!  The waitress noticed that we waited a long haul without getting any of the items we requested (sauce, extra place settings, etc.) so she came by, graciously apologized, and got us an extra order of fries. That's great customer service there.  I'm not sure under what pretenses I'll come back here, I'm sure there are other pastrami places to explore in Vegas!",

I wasn't sure who my waitress was as I wasn't really greeted. The prices here seem really high. It was $9 for the grilled cheese I ordered, and it came with nothing. I thought about ordering fries, but a side was $6! I saw some girls with a huge plate of fries and I didn't want that many anyway. I decided to order a potato pancake instead. It came out first and it was huge. It was burned around the edges and was just ok. The sandwich came out next and it was not done correctly. It was on rye (yuck) when I ordered wheat. It was also tiny for $9 and coming with nothing. I wasn't checked on for my entire meal and couldn't catch the waitress's eye, so I wasn't able to send it back. I needed to get back to the room to greet my friend, so I didn't have time to order another. I ended up just eating the potato pancake. The waitress finally came back and she told me my whole meal was comped, which was nice, considering there was no way I wanted to pay $9 for a grilled cheese that wasn't even good.  I saw some of the other sandwiches here, the famous huge ones, and I can't imagine how one would actually eat or want to eat such a thing. You'd have to dissect it and it really isn't a sandwich at that point. Just my opinion.  I avoided the place the rest of my stay. Just not my cup of tea and pricy for the quality.",

The hostess sat me and I waited, and waited, and waited and then waited some more.  Literally 15 minutes went by (I checked my watch when I sat down) and not only did nobody ever come to take my order but nobody even came by to say they would be right with me. Absolutely pathetic.   I saw 2 different servers working the floor that night. Not only were they both moving with the speed and enthusiasm or your typical DMV employee, but they never even bothered to look in my direction.  After the aforementioned 15 minutes I got up and went to another restaurant in the Mirage.  From looking at the menu, which I obviously had plenty of time to do, I can tell you that aside from the horrible service, this place is highly overpriced.  I will not be giving them a second chance.",

Beasted this amalgamation of Hot Pastrami and Corned Beef in one sitting; this sandwich was \"My Everest\" as the wise sage Joey Tribbiani once put it.  Pretty tasty, slightly dry towards the end, but it was good enough for me to keep picking at it until I was confronted with the real thought of actually killing the whole thing.  A copious amount of their house deli mustard didn't hurt either.  I ended up just picking up the meat with my hands all primal caveman style, which I have to admit, made it more fun to eat.  Felt like bursting after and probably have an educated guess as to what carrying a 6 month old baby is like now.  I still have to put Katz's Hot Pastrami over this one though, but I liked what I had.  All of it.",

    "text": "Came here over the weekend. The food was OK but IMO $15-$20 is a little pricey for a deli sandwich, but they certainly do give you a very, very large portion. We also had an order of sausages that were way too oily (And I ain't afraid of grease in my food). The thing that left me with a bad taste in my mouth was the service which was possibly the worst experience I've ever had in my many trips to Las Vegas. First it took the waitress forever to get our drinks and to take our order, then when the sandwich came out it almost slipped off our plate and the waitress palmed it with her (probably dirty) bare hand to stop it. We should have asked for another sandwich because that's gross -- even the workers in Ghetto Banh Mi shops in Westminster use gloves to touch the sandwiches-- but we were hungry so we didn't want to wait. I had to ask for refills several times as they never really came by to check up on us and it took them forever to bring us our check. Yeah I understand that they were busy and probably one of their servers called out or something but it shouldn't take 15 minutes for them to bring us our check. We weren't the only ones waiting for our check, there was at least two other tables I saw in our immediate area waiting to pay. The worst part was there were three hosts standing right next to us just chitchatting, I know that it probably isn't part of their jobs to clean tables and print out checks, but they should be helping the servers rather than just doing nothing... it just gives a very bad perception to customers. While the food was okay I will not be coming back because of their lousy service. No I did not tip and BTW they also have a $3 sharing fee. REALLY????",

I guess I'm just thinking about America and obesity, the effects of increased portion sizes on how much we eat, food waste, and the economics of all of this.

Maybe I am being a little critical, because you won't get a sandwich this big anywhere else in town.",

    "text": "Carnegie has the yummiest deli sandwiches. There is something about the meats that is simply amazing. I usually get the corned beef, but I have had the pastrami, too. My mouth is salivating as I type. It is that good.   I have a couple tips/warnings:   -The servings are huge. So either share or expect to bring food home.  -There is only one size for french fries. So if you're eating alone, you might want to skip it because you'll be wasting a lot.  -The place is cramp.  -The prices are expensive.   Weird side note - I always order iced coffee when I'm there. I usually like my coffee with cream and sugar, but the coffee plain here is super good. I can taste it right now. YUM!!!   If you do make it to dessert, I would suggest the strawberry cheesecake. The texture is different from any other cheesecake I have tasted. It is rich in flavor. The strawberries compliment the cheesecake as opposed to being overbearing.   If you don't mind being cramp and spending a little extra cash, then you got to try Carnegie. Try to stick to the meatier sandwiches, desserts, and iced coffee. Oh yeah, and maybe the Matzo Soup. I personally haven't had it, but I heard it was good.",

I only found it because my fiancee and I were going to watch Beatles Love at the Mirage and that's when I saw it.    We were seated right away and after a lengthy look at the menu my fiancee decided on the chicken soup with noodles and I finally decided on getting the Woody Allen.  The waiter warned me that it was a very big sandwich and just wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into.   The soup was brought out and in the bowl was some noodles and the chicken soup in a little pitcher.  They pour the soup onto the noodles in front of you.  She loved the soup but I thought it was kind of bland.  The sandwich finally arrived and OMG this thing is freaking huge.  If you love corned beef and pastrami you will love this sandwich.  One thing's for sure, they give you plenty of meat.  Spread on some of their homemade mustard and take an occasional bite of their homemade pickles and everything just seems to meld with each other.    I only ate half the sandwich and I took the rest home.  The waiter was nice enough to give me a little container to take some of the homemade mustard home so I packed the meat, mustard and a few pickles and used my own bread at home to make another sandwich and it was just as good.  Definitely have to go back there the next time I'm in Vegas again.  Their desserts looked really good too.",

    "text": "Mmm hmm (clears throat), channeling Zero Mostel. There are way too many people posting reviews who don't know anything about Jewish delis. Big sandwiches are part of the tradition; if you don't like it, eat at the boring California Pizza Kitchen next door. I'm sure their serving size is more appropriate to your needs. I admittedly have not been to New York to visit Katz's or Second Avenue Deli. However, I have been to Langer's, Brent's and Canter's in LA, and when it's on, this is the best pastrami sandwich I have ever tasted. Juicy, peppery, pastrami steamed just right! Fan-freaking-tastic. The smell in this restaurant makes me swoon in pastrami lust.  But this is not a one-note deli. If you like stuffed cabbage, please try theirs. This is the best stuffed cabbage I have ever tasted (I know, I know I said the same thing with the pastrami!) Delectable sweet and sour sauce with raisins. The ratio of sweet to sour is perfect. Amazing! I haven't even gotten to the knishes. Again, when they're on, these are the best I've sunk my teeth into. The right mix of garlic and onions inside for an incredibly perfect pastrami compliment. Also, if you like kishke, try theirs. No, it's not homemade like Brent's, but it is prepared well, with a rich, spicy flavor. The scrumptious gravy is the icing on the kishke. Try their brown gravy with the knish as well. Woah. I am drooling just thinking about it!",

Went here for lunch on a weekday and it was packed so we waited about 15 minutes.  The tables are pretty small and I was rubbin elbows with the folks next to me but I was hungry so it wasn't a big deal.   I ordered the Woody Allen sandwich and If I remember correctly it has 1 pound of pastrami and 1 pound of corned beef.   Got a few pickles and some fries on the side, that was good as well.   Now back to the sandwich. It was f-ing huge. I can count on one hand how many plates of food that were stuck in front of me that I didn't lick clean and this was one of those times. This behemoth of a sandwich I was unable to finish. I ate the first 1/2 pretty quickly but only got about 1/2 way through the 2nd 1/2. With a quarter of the sandwich left I stood defeated and with that much greasy meat I can assure you I was not feeling so great afterwards.   My suggestion if you want to get your moneys worth here is to order the woody allen, eat till your full, get a togo bag with the rest of the meat then buy a loaf of rye bread and some mustard. You'll have enough meat left to make 5-10 sandwiches.   All in all I thought the meal was good and I'm always up for a good challenge which is what happened here as I left the restaurant defeated!",

Stop by when putting in your bet or on your way thru the Mirage.. well worth it..",

Its one saving grace is that its overstuffed pastrami sandwiches are as good as before, with melt-in-your-mouth pastrami, unlike the rubbery stuff served at Canter's Deli.",

After seeing what was available, we decided to try out the Carnegie Deli, which I hear is famous in New York City. (funny this wouldn't be in the NYNY casino, but whatever.)  We had heard good things about the pastrami here, and having been warned about the size of the portions, we actually ordered the pastrami and salami sandwich (23.99) with an order of fries and decided to \"share\" the sandwich. They charge you 3.00 to share, which was okay by me, since I wanted to try it out and wasn't nearly THAT hungry! As other reviewers are stating, the sandwiches are freaking ginormous! I mean huge! I couldn't finish that thing in one sitting at my hungriest! I mean that was some Man Vs. Food sh*t right there!  But just because the portions are huge doesn't mean quality is sacrificed! The salami was great, don't get me wrong, but the pastrami was deeeeeeeeelicious! Mmm.mmm...MMM! Not only that, but even the fries (5.99) were tasty and it was a huge heaping plate full!  I read some of the reviews about bad service, so I was braced for less than stellar service, but that just wasn't the case for us last night. Our waitress was sweet, friendly, and attentive, despite that fact that it was a full house with a long line waiting.   My only complaint woul have to be the prices. I mean it was really good and you are on the strip....but damn, 24.00 for a sandwich is a bit much no matter how yummy it may be...  But, it was still a pleasant experience and when family visits (Momma loves the Mirage) I can see myself coming back here to try more of the menu. The prices just keep it from being a regular thing.  4 stars.",

But for a quick smoked meat fix, Carnegie hits all the high notes.    I'd stay away from the huge bowl of chicken soup and rice.  That was a big mistake and waste.

Food was ok, nothing overly tantalizing to my taste buds or anything like that though. Omelette was a little on the watery side and even though the Cinnamon Roll was yummy it was very cold in the middle, I should of thought to have them heat it up but if we ever eat here again I'll remember that.  Only one snaffu during our experience, they originally brought me cinnamon toast first and I showed the waitress Maria that I had in fact ordered the Cinnamon Roll. After a few minutes I was wondering if I was ever going to get my Cinnamon Roll but then I realized for as busy as they were they were VERY understaffed.  Basically you order you food and pay at the front counter then find yourself a seat. Since they were obviously understaffed there were quite a few tables empty but not yet cleared, saw a patron clear off and wipe down here own table as there weren't any available to sit at. I think if they had busers it would make this place much better.  Overall wasn't a horrible experience and our waitress Maria, was friendly, attentive and kept the coffee flowing which is always a plus in my book. If we stay at the Mirage again on our next Vegas trip I'd give this place another shot, hopefully they give the servers some much needed help.",

Since we found out we still had an hour and a half before the show starts, we decided to grab a small snack that we can share prior watching the show.  Then we saw Carnegie. My husband was ecstatic since it was one of his favorite deli places to get a good pastrami sandwich.   So, we ordered the pastrami sandwich, a slice of their NY Cheesecake and a slice of their rich chocolate cake.   The pastrami was so huge that we were able to cut it in 4 and shared amongst the 4 of us. As for the flavor, it's ok. I think I've tasted better pastrami sandwiches in NewJersey.   Likewise, we enjoyed the taste of the desserts. The chocolate cake was very sweet and rich.. enough to satisfy one's sweet tooth. The cheesecake was ok.  I gave this a 3star since we weren't even offered any water..just because we didn't order any drinks to go with our snacks, we also didn't get any complimentary water. The waiters were too busy to even care when we tried getting their attention to get some water.  But if you do want pastrami sandwich, this is an ok place to get it.",

First of all, there were only 4 people in front of us and it took 20min to finally get to the cashier. It should not take that long to order. Second of all, the cashier was not friendly at ALL. She seemed like she hated her job. We paid for an OVERPRICED $13 sandwich to share with a $20 bill, and the cashier gave us a receipt and called \"NEXT\" for the next customer. Ummmm excuuuuse you, where's our $7 in change? That ain't no tip for your sh*tty service! She just laughed and apologized as if she didn't know any better. *rolls my eyes*  Two stars for the mediocre food and the waiter for being somewhat nice (shocker). If Mirage offered more breakfast joints like have a food court, we wouldn't have gone here.",

I decided to go simple and went with their famous pastrami.  Hot Pastrami -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Xsi8cp&s=7c4ab2f586472b1546a83c1042b89485188e7d1aaf65ce268534b49928063fc0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2Xsi8cp</a> A very satisfying big portion of pastrami in this sandwich.  And the pastrami was hot and juicy.  I actually liked this better than the Open Faced Reuben I had from them before which had way too much going on with the layers of cheese and kraut on top.  A solid pastrami sandwich, however it's still not quite up there with Katz's in NYC.   Carnegie is still a great 24 hour spot that you can go any time of day.  The food is a little on the pricier side for sandwiches, but they make up for that with their huge portions.",

They seemed short-staffed as the person taking the orders at the register was also bagging Togo orders.    After placing our orders and paying, they gave us a number to place on our table. And, shortly after picking a table to sit at, a waiter came by and dropped off our drinks.  A few minutes later, he also brought out our orders.  The customer service was spotty but we were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed everything: a grilled frankfurter, a bagel with cream cheese and lox, a slice of strawberry cheesecake, and a potato knish.

    "text": "My experience at Carnegie was fantastic! I went  2x in one night: pre-show for a pastrami sandwich and then post-show for dessert and coffee.   Both times, the cashiers were great - very nice - and explained how the dining room worked (you order at the counter, a server brings your food and checks up on you during your meal).  I got the same server both times and he was cool - engaged in conversation and made sure that my party had everything that we needed including refills for our drinks.   The food came out quickly - which is perfect for when you are on the property to see a show or just don't want to sit for a meal for a very long time.   The pastrami sandwich was large and delicious. It comes plain (just bread and meat). You can ask for add-ons and the condiments are on the table. You can also order a reubens if that's what you prefer. The meat was tender and flavorful, not salty, and not too lean (I love a little bit of fatty pastrami).  They also have matzo ball soup (which I will need to try), knish, salads, corned beef, brisket, roast beef, turkey, chicken liver, and other yummy eats that you would expect from a good New York style deli...OH and both the pastrami and corned beef are shipped in from New York!   For dessert, I ordered the chocolate cake and the cherry cheesecake. Both slices were also very large and  were not overpoweringly sweet. Very good with coffee - and their coffee was good. Nothing fancy - just a good cup of drip!   I'll definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu.",

Pastrami was tasty and the bread nice and fresh.  Hubby said the beef brisket was flavorful.  His came french drip style with au jus.  He got his sandwich with sliced sourdough.  He should've gotten the roll because his was hard to hold together when he dipped it.  There was so much meat!!  Awesome little sandwich shop inside the Mirage.",

We didn't have to wait in line or anything. You order at the counter and they give you a number and they bring it out to you.

There was no wait-time at the register, and there were plenty of seating. You order at the register and then get seated.  The Reuban with corned beef was delicious. It's an open-faced sandwich with lots of meat and flavor. It was well seasoned and it'll definitely fill you up.  The Brisket Sandwich was definitely my preferred sandwich! It comes with an Au Jus that you should definitely use because it's beautifully salty and flavorful. The sandwich is a little on the dry side, but I think it's intended to be dipped in the Au Jus. I would recommend this sandwich.  The Potato Pancakes are tasty and come with sour cream and apple sauce, which seems like a weird combination; it actually works out pretty well. The pancakes are a savory dish sort of like latkas, so they're a bit salty. The cream balances out the salt and crispness, and the apple sauce adds some sugar into the mix.  Service is pretty good here. They're fast on refilling drinks and checking up on us. They're also fairly nice.",

It's pretty much full set I e from there.   The Pork Belly Reuben Sliders they have right now are small bites perfect for a quick lunch. They come three to a plate. They taste fantastic. On my first day I had these with a side of cheese blintzes and I was satisfied. The cheese blintze are a bit dry so your best bet is to use either sour cream or apple sauce to make them perfect for you. I used both.   The second day I went in for the Deli famous Reuben with Pastrami. OMG it was huge and full of flavor. I had it for lunch and dinner today. And I was stuffed both times. I still haven't finished the strawberry cheesecake I ordered with it. That'll have to be breakfast. But I can tell you by the few bites I was able to fit in that it is the best cheesecake you'll get around here. I can't wait to finish it.  So if you haven't been to the original Carnegie Deli in New York, you can come here and rest assured you'll feel like your in New York. Enjoy folks.",

(:  It's a pretty basic pastrami--it's still good and will hit the spot, but I've had better; plus it's pricey! $18, yikes. 3 stars for you. The Reuben Sandwich also sounds amazing. Next time for sure! Great friendly service and a cool relaxing place--despite the fact you're in a busy hotel on the strip (The Mirage.) It's a nice walk to get to this spot and I'll be visiting again real soon. Xoxo enjoy!",

Stood in line about 5 mins, ordered, and easily found a seat. Ordered the bacon and eggs, which come with toast and country potatoes and a coffee. Food was good, filling, and for a reasonable non-vegas price. Spent a little under $20 for breakfast.  Waiter was spot on, kept checking on me, was polite, and friendly. Cup of joe was fresh.  ONLY downside, is that when you order a cup of coffee, they give you your mug at the cashiers, so you have to carry this very hot drink around the place until you find a seat. There's families with kids, older people, and drunk/hungover bodies. This is just waiting for a BIG accident to happen. Maybe just have the waiters take the cup to the table? Just a thought.   Def will be back.",

Order and pay at the counter than take a seat anywhere in the restaurant so you think the line would move faster!! Maybe people don't decide what to order until they get to the register??  Oh well, we ordered the following:  1. Homemade Chicken Broth with Golden Noodles: Hot & Delicious! Not too salty and the noodles are thin & soft! Some celery and carrots that are soft and tender! Absolute Comfort Food!  2. Hot Pastrami Sandwich: 2/3 pounds of slender and lean meat!! Served with 2 dill pickles. No sour pickles! Big enough sandwich to share! Perfect with the Chicken Soup!  Worth the wait!",

Everything was good, not overcooked nor undercooked. It was your average breakfast fare, simple and reliably good. This was not what surprised me though. It was very busy when we went (11 AM-ish) but our food came out in not even 10 minutes! I'd definitely come here again for tasty breakfast classics that will come out within a matter of minutes.

But if you're prepared for it, hit the deli. You'll be looking at about $16 for a sandwich, but for the money you'll either be stuffed for the night or you'll have food for two days.

The \"Reuben Sandwich\" and the \"Woody Allen\" were so big that there was no way you could finish it in one sitting. Eating the Reuben at Carnegie was like a 12 round boxing match; you needed stamina, endurance, and the will the go on. Times have changed.   Today, I finally got to meet one of my Dad's old military friends. They became friends in the early 1970s, but lost contact after they were discharged from the marine corp. The old man mentioned to me that he grew up in New York and that he is Jewish. I immediately told him about \"Carnegie\" and he was elated at the idea of eating one of those gigantic sandwiches. I googled the \"Carnegie Reuben\" and \"Woody Allen\" to show him the pictures and next thing I know he had sent me to the Mirage to buy him some good Kosher Deli. I really wanted to please the old man because my Dad had been telling me stories about him since I was a kid...but, unfortunately Carnegie didn't live up the hype.  It appears that Carnegie is cutting corners now. The Sandwich was only about 1/2 the size of what it used to be. Back in the old days, you weren't able to fit the sandwich in your mouth due to it's practical-joke oversized gimmick. We both finished our sandwiches in less than 5 minutes. He looked at me like I was some kind of idiot and told me: \" you don't know what real kosher deli  is\". It was a drag letting the old man down.",

    "text": "***************HIT OR MISS*****************  A group of us stopped to eat here since one person in a group recommended it.  If you have never been here it is inside the Mirage Hotel (the hotel itself is very nice).    They give huge portions certainly one sandwich can feed two people and unless you are starving I suggest sharing.    We ordered the borscht, \"creamy\" tomato soup and chicken liver with onions.  Others in the group order the Reuben covered in cheese (not sure what's it's called if it has a name)....if you're lactose intolerant stay away from that one!!  The borscht was pretty good, though they forgot to give me the sour cream.  The chicken liver & onions were very good, though we prefer beef liver.  They were nicely cooked on the outside and the onions sweet and caramelized...ummm delishhh!!  On the other hand the \"creamy\" tomato was more like boiled tomatoes thrown in a blender and a handful of sugar added.  DO NOT recommend this dish.  It did not have a creamy consistency, look or more important taste.   The cheese covered Reuben was ok, nothing spectacular just large portions, and they rave about the \"deli fries\" which were ordinary French fries nothing specially to write home about.   Now the cheesecake with strawberries OMG!! ah-mazing!!  The service....ehh so so.  I realize that with large groups it's more complicated but a seasoned server should have it down packed and at this point forgetting items or giving us the wrong ones is just not acceptable.  And the only reason why I know our server was season was because a friend recognized her from many times before and she herself said she'd been a food server for decades.    Now as far as the server's assistant (the drink person) she was completely unacceptable.  When we asked about a menu item her solve all answer was \"I don't know ask your server!\"...humm I'm sorry but don't you work here too?? Or do you eat at the place down the street???  Not to mention that she did not make an effort to find an answer apparently anything other than drinks is above her pay grade!!  Also, the prices are a bit steep, for a sandwich I rather spend that money on a good hamburger somewhere else.   Overall, it's kind of a hit or miss, really depends on what your order.  So, all I can say is take your chance maybe you'll get lucky.  As far as we are concerned I don't think we will be eating here again, at least not anytime soon.",

While I do appreciate the fact that they are open very late and are a somewhat cheaper alternative to room service, I'd like to point out the fact that their food is extremely over-priced.  During my last outing to Las Vegas, I decided to try this place out.  I got a turkey sandwich ($27 with cheese, lettuce, tomato and onions) and a slice of cake.  When I asked for mustard and mayo on the sandwich, I was immediately told that it would be on the side.  Now, I know this may make me seem like an a**hole, but when I'm dropping close to 30 bucks for a sandwich, the least that you can do is spread the mustard and mayo on the bloody thing for me, not give me a bunch of packs.  The sandwich itself was waaaaay too large.  I understand how alluring the 12 inch high sandwich could be, but in reality a sandwich that tall is just too big to eat.  After being unable to bite into the sandwich, I found myself in my room having to break it down into sections and unfortunately I only had 2 pieces of bread for about 2lbs of turkey.  My suggestion would be to simply make the sandwiches smaller and charge a lesser price.  I know that some people would like the idea of splitting one, but the problem is that you only get 2 small slices of bread and a couple of pounds of meat.",

    "text": "We were in line for Jet nightclub when our party (who was partying inside already) came spilling out early to say they were hungry.  Just as well, it saved us a $50 cover charge and now we were going to eat.  Not wanting to go far, we stumbled over to the Carnegie Delicatessen with our large party.  As we waited in line, everyone went through the dramatics of the night.  It was our turn when the host started to close off the line.  I was confused for a moment, thinking he wasn't going to let us in.  He proceeded to motion for us to follow and he had a table waiting for us already!  Sweet...except that he had only counted ten as two other people had joined us in the line late.  It's okay, we were able to have our additional party of two nearby.  Yummy pickles were placed in front of us and I wish I had more.  The menu was huge and I didn't even know where to look.  The BF wanted \"The Woody Allen\", a gigantic sandwich with loads of pastrami and corned beef ($15.95).  The waitress warned us that it was a big sandwich, as high as our water glass.  We were fine with it as we were sharing.  Indeed, it was a big one, as you can see for yourself from the photo above.  Everyone asked if I was going to get that all in my mouth...uh, hello...I'm a lady...in a dress!  Yeah, I'm busting out with a fork and knife thank you!  You definitely need to smear that mustard all up on your meat to give it a zing.  I didn't really care for the bread though.  The BF finished his half and my leftovers went home.  (They were a bit dry the next day, but if you add some olive oil and stick it in the toaster oven, it's damn good again!)    Our waitress was a doll and so was one of the busgirls.  When a table cleared up closer to our table of ten, I asked if we could move the table over so our other party of two could join us.  The waitress said of course, but then as she walked away, the mean old busboy started taking the chairs away!  I told him we were actually going to use that table and he said, \"No! We're closed!\"  Uh, we hadn't even received our food yet, so I KNOW it wasn't a problem for them, he was just a complete asshole!  The busgirl ended up overriding him and gave us the table (yay for her!) and so our party of 12 was together again.  Things are a la carte here, so no fries with your burger or sandwiches.  But with them being so big, I guess you don't really need them.  They also have breakfast served all day and specialties like \"hot tongue\" and \"chopped liver\" to entice your palette.  My friend got an \"Order of Bacon\" ($5.50), and I do mean an order, it's definitely not a side!   Five stars for the host trying to be efficient by counting heads for our party without asking us how many we were and one star for the jerk of an ass old man busboy who hates his job.    3.5 stars overall.",

Now when I went back to Vegas in December it's cafeteria style, and the menu is watered down. Whoever had the audacity to change a winning formula should have their brain examined. No longer will I consider the Carnegie delicatessen a must visit destination.",

    "text": "Carnegie's is located at the Mirage, near the Sportsbook.   The front of the menu reads: \"Home of the best pastrami and corned beef in town and blitntzes too!\"  This may be, but at $17.99 a sandwich it's a hard to swallow the price even for Vegas.  What to do in this dilemma? SHARE a sandwich, ask for water, and take your order to go.    Me and my boyfriend shared the corned beef sandwich since we're both not fans of pastrami. Trust when I say, it'll be more than enough: the sandwiches are HUGE. Since the prices on sodas and bottled drinks, including bottled water, were also ridic we ordered regular water. The water cups were given in a normal sized drinking cup with a lid as opposed to the mini sized water cups I abhor. We avoided dining in since the place was packed and opted to take our order to and sit at Sportsbook. I was very pleased that we only ended up paying for the sandwich.  Overall the corned beef was good.  They're very generous with the meat, I had to take apart my half of the sandwich and remove some of the meat just to get the sandwich in my mouth. The sandwich was spot on: the corned beef was very flavorful and tender combined with the tangy mustard we asked for on the side.   Would I have it again? Yes, but only if I share it with someone!",

Our food arrived promptly and we were pleased to see that the sandwich was indeed big enough for us to share. Not that I can't eat one of these sandwiches myself. But we just wanted a small meal. Now here's the important part .... the pastrami was delicious. Considering how lousy most pastrami has become since the good old days, this pastrami reminded me of old time New York deli pastrami. Sure, it's not cheap at $17 a sandwich, but this is Vegas. And 7 bucks for a small dish of cole slaw? Not worth it ... even at Vegas hotel prices. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the pastrami and will be back.",

If ever near the restaurant again my husband and I would order The Woody Allen and fries and split it. He got the Woody on his on and I got the Pastrami Sandwich and we split a plate of fries. The food came out promptly which was nice. My husbands towering meat mountain was a sight to see. We actually sat at a window table and people would literally stop to gawk at it and some even came up to comment. The pastrami was SO tasty, as well as the corned beef (I sampled his!). Tender and extremely flavorful. The rye bread was soft and tasted the way it should. I dinged them because it could have used a slice of cheese or something to accompany the meat. Ask for mayo too, the mustard on the table is quite fabulous but add a squirt of mayo and it's golden. Their water was terrible as well, unfiltered doo doo, spend a few extra bucks and get a fountain drink or just avoid a drink.",

In the past the corned beef hash had  been excellent with big chunks of corned beef and onion fried crispy and served overflowing a huge plate  Earlier this week, the corned beef hash was a small portion, had a peculiar aftertaste,  was minced to the consistency of dog food and was greasy and served lukewarm, almost like it was not ever on the griddle.  I also ordered rye toast and a cinnamon roll to go.  While the rye toast was good, the cinnamon roll was stale and I had to ask the server multiple times to bring them, even though I had already ordered and paid in advance.  I also observed at least three other diners in the vicinity of my table who left half of their sandwiches completely  untouched, so I am surmising the sandwiches were less than satisfactory.  It is not surprising that it was easy to get a table at lunch time.",

Mounds of hot corned beef covered by melted cheese and sauerkraut.  A huge bowl of thousand island served on the side, which makes dipping perfect.  Ambitiously, I always order the full sandwich - and realistically I can only finish about 3/4 of it.  This thing is huge.   The deli is tucked inside the Mirage Hotel, this place is well worth the wait when their is a line - and even better if you can grab a table before or after peak mealtimes.  I've never been to NY, so I can't speak to Carnegie's authenticity but eating at their Vegas location is always a treat for me.",

Unfortunately, they now have take-out orders and dine in customers line-up together and place orders at the same cashier. While my wife ordered at CPK across the hallway, I waited in a line of 15 people to get to the counter to order. By the time she had her food, I had moved 4 people closer to the counter. As I left in disgust, I noticed that there were more people in line than in the restaurant, which was almost empty. Obviously, the idea of eliminating waitstaff by transferring ordering to the cashier is a failure (I was not the only one to leave without ordering). I will never go back and based on their new business model I doubt they will remain in business long.",

Even the free pickles they give you were pretty gross.  Everyone had one bite, then just left them.

    "text": "I was at the Mirage today for a trade show and decided to finally give this joint a try.  I should have known better when I saw that you had to be seated by a hostess.....what Deli seats you with a hostess?  Seriously?  Anyway, I asked to be seated and she sat me at a two top table that had place settings, but the table was still dirty with small pieces of pickle on the table....gross.  After browsing the menu, I almost left.  The prices were ridiculous!  I decided to stick it out and be a trooper and give the place a chance.  I ordered a $15.99 Hot Pastrami Sandwich on Rye Bread.....that's right folks.....that's not a typo....$15.99 for a Hot Pastrami Sandwich and it doesn't come with Chips or Fries.....FREE pickles though, which tasted pretty good.  To wash it down, I ordered an Iced Tea and Water.....the server didn't leave me any straws (I hate that by the way).....yet every other table around me had straws.....and I watched....nobody asked for them, they were just given to them by their server.  Maybe my server was having an off day....I don't know.  The food came out pretty fast.  The Pastrami Sandwich is your typical New York Style.......5 inches of meat that's impossible to put in your mouth.  Since my name isn't Joey Chestnut (Google him), I took a fork and pulled 20% of it out so that I could eat it like a normal person.  Besides the complimentary Pickles that were awesome, the other thing that saved this joint from a 1 Star was the Deli Mustard on the table.....man was it awesome!  I doused each bit with this Mustard....which made the sandwich edible because the Pastrami was dried out and too chewy.  Also, the crust of the Rye Bread was tough....had a Beef Jerky texture to it.....what?  I've never had Rye Bread like that......maybe it's normal, but not in my book.  I forced myself to finish it because I didn't want my $25 meal (Iced Tea was $3.50 for glass, plus tax and gratuity) to go to waste.  I'm not a cheapskate, but damn I can have some great meals for $25.  Will I come back?  Not unless you're paying the bill.",

    "text": "It's hard for us to review a place like Carnegie Deli. On one hand, you get such a comically large amount of food that it seems like a waste. They have to know that most of their patrons are visitors who are staying in a hotel room, and many of those rooms do not have refrigerators. So you end up paying for at least 2 meals' worth of food at once only to have your (likely substantial) leftovers end up in the trash.  On the other hand, this is one of the few places on the strip where prices actually seem reasonable for what you get. This is despite the bogus extra charge we saw on the menu for sharing. I mean, you're already gorging on meat, must you also be gouged too?  That being said, the food--at least what we could eat of it--was good but not spectacular. I had the matzo ball soup and turkey burger. The burger was so large that I ended up eating the meat and leaving much of the bun behind. My husband, who wanted to try both the pastrami and corned beef, foolishly opted for the Woody Allen, which bears additional explanation:  This is not really a \"sandwich\" but rather a huge mound of meat stuck between two regular pieces of rye bread and held together by long toothpicks. It was impossible to pick up, not to mention impossible to finish in one sitting. He probably ate a third of it using his fingers and fork. Both meats had good flavor, as did the deli mustard in the bottle on our table.  Service was a little slow but we were in no hurry so it didn't bother us. We do give our server props for warning us about the size of the Woody Allen. Next time maybe we should listen to him.  Ambiance was good for people watching--the deli is tucked in a high-traffic corner of the Mirage casino.",

Very good for a Jewish Deli on the strip at Mirage, but not remotely close to the yummy delicatessens in New York.  I have never been to New York's famous Carnegie deli, but I hope that restaurant is better than this place.  Very large portions for the price similar to New York sandwich places.  My husband and I split a full sandwich and a chicken noodle matzo ball soup; We were both contently but not overly full.   The chicken noodle soup did not taste homemade (the soup was pretty much a can of chicken broth), but the matzo ball itself was decent.    Also similar to the New York vibe were the waitresses who give mediocre customer service.  Not good Black and White Cookies.  I would skip the desserts if the rest of the baked goods taste like that cookie.",

I ordered the Hot Pastrami Sandwich, and my friends ordered a Corned Beef and Egg Sandwich and a Brisket of Beef Sandwich.

The sandwiches were ginormous!  The meat was piled high and I had to pick out some of the meat before I could even attempt to take a bite.  The meat was very tasty and not too salty.    The sandwiches do seem a bit pricey, but when you're in Vegas, you can't expect anything that cheap in the major hotels.  And they do give you a really big portion.  They also stay open late, so you can get a bite to eat in between party hopping.",

However, as far as taste goes their pastrami is a little bland and dry compared to Langers and Kats.  I suspect the original location may not have this problem and this may be a case of the Vegas version not as good as the original.  It is decent though and better than your run of the mill pastrami.  Here are some cool things we ordered and were unable to finish.  Woody Allen - King of kings.  Mountain of pastrami and corn beef with bread hidden somewhere in there.  Definitely picture worthy.  Jeffs Favorite - Plate of pastrami or corn beef with a sweet delicious potato knish hidden underneath.  Once you break through the meat exterior and hit the knish center youll be pleasantly suprised.  I added some sauerkraut.  Biggest but not the best.",

No longer is there a server taking your order, you order your food , pay for it and the server will deliver it to you.  Self service. We will never go back to Carnegie Deli in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "AWWW NY Style like Deli Food....WOW the serving sizes are astronomical!   We went on a Saturday just before Mother's day to celebrate \"ME\" of course the \"Mother's of all Mother's\"....So with that Me and my 3 boys go all the way to the strip valet park and go into this place to have our lunch.  The menu is so freaken large and so much to choose from you have no idea what to order.....Then when you do it comes out HUGE of course just like the menu!  Although you do receive quite a bit of meat in your sandwich it's almost tasteless not much for seasonings I guess...they don't dress their sandwich's with any type of sauces you have ask for mayo or mustard.  The potatoe pancakes were overly cooked and had not one ounce of salt or pepper on around or in them what so ever could of used a little onion too in my opinion.   As we were downing our meat gorged sandwiches we were asked if we wanted refills and of course we were in dire need of more beverages....so on with our meals and at the end of it all we were unable to finish half of our sandwiches, we pack them to go and the bill comes....O M G to the 25th Power is all I have to say!!!!!   Not only were our meals HUGE the menus HUGE but so was our bill!!!  $120 later and they charged for every refill $4 each...I thought WWJD...Complain? Dine & Dash?  or just bight the Bullet and Pay the Bill?  So be it Paid and walked away full belly but empty wallet!   OY VEY...I WON'T BE BACK....This MexiJew Can't Afford It!!!",

Aparently in November 2014, they decided to no longer offer table service. They have opted for a fast food approach - order at the counter model. Welcome to McCarnegie! If like me you order soup or an appetizer to accompany your main course and awesome desert, you will be forced to have all three courses delivered at once. While we ate I heard three other tables of returning guests complain to the manager. A very poor decision. Unfortunately, I will not be back. Is there a Katz Deli in Vegas?",

They served complimentary pickled tomatoes and pickles as appetizer! (and some swear by these as hangover remedies)  The service was quick and the staff very pleasant. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. He even managed to take a few pictures of our group amidst all their hustle and bustle!  My entire group enjoyed the food. We all had different breakfast options.  Be prepared, the portions are humongous--definitely your money's worth. I'd say you can easily split most dishes between 2 people! We all had plenty of leftovers...  Also, I saw a bunch of people eating these giant sandwiches stuffed with freshly sliced deli meats & they looked BOMB! Next time I am in vegas, I am coming back for one of those",

First of all - the prices are ridiculous.  Granted - they give you a ton of food, but what does that matter when the quality is below par?  Secondly - there was always a long, involved line during peak hours.  The one time I believe we were able to get in and sit at a booth was during breakfast hours while all the party monsters are just going to bed.....ahh Vegas.    Thirdly - the service was dreadful.  The food was bland and took forever.  The server had a meh attitude and didn't exude any helpful or friendly behaviour whatsoever.    Fourth...ly?  Just go down to Fremont Street to find a better deli and dining experience.  Carnegie ain't it, folks.  That is all.",

I think people should be a bit more specific when they start writing reviews like, it's way too much food for 3 people to handle... It must be the special pastrami sandwich they have there for like $24.00 bucks or so.. but still at just 6.00 buck less the regular pastrami sandwich is nothing close to being too much meat.  I've always been a pastrami sandwich fan, and it was just ok.. definitely not worth going back again even if it was reasonably priced.  The pickle? hmmm I read other reviews saying how good it was.. im thinking.. WTF? it's way too raw tasting, not much sweetness or much flavor, other than like if you're biting into a very plain, raw tasting crunchy pickle.  The best part of the entire lunch was the fries...  Im sure, everyone has their own opinion of what's good, and what's good for the buck... my honest opinion, just go and expect you're eating at the mirage...and expect the appropriate price being in a nice hotel on the strip, than you wont be too disappointed.",

I have no clue if they get the exact same meat as in New York.  Not sure how that works.  My husband and I were smart......we SPLIT a pastrami sandwich, and it was perfect.  They give so much meat, so we were definitely full.  I had ordered a side of coleslaw to go with it, and it was pretty darn tasty, too.  Cheesecake is STILL divine.  My children got the Woody Allen, which was a RIDICULOUS amount of corned beef AND pastrami together.  I raised them to know that rye bread goes with pastrami, but I failed somewhere because they ordered this on wheat.  I won't tell my dad.  LOL.  Naturally, they didn't come close to finishing, and we, of course, couldn't put the leftovers in our refrigerator because of the stupid cost per ounce to hold things in there.  Don't get me going on that one.  Certainly not Carnegie's fault.  I was happy to learn that all the leftovers are not wasted.....they get fed to a pig farm.  Interesting !!!  This place is ONE redeeming factor for the Mirage Hotel.  Yes, prices are steep for a sandwich, but it's a deli, and that's what they do..........plus, you get more than your money's worth of meat.",

(3) it's not amazing food. the potatoes in the potato salad needed to be boiled a bit more. way to hard and chewy. And the recipe was boring.  (4) they pack way too much meat on the sandwich. i had to pull off maybe half the chopped liver to even be able to eat the sandwich, which went to waste. i would suggest cutting the meat you serve up in half, and reduce menu pricing.   overall, there is a disconnect between what you pay and what you get. it's a decent meal, but just be prepared to pay way too much for a mediocre experience.",

My updated review was for the woody Allen and I would give it 3-4 stars.  1st review - We ordered the French toast, corned beef hash and a side of bacon. Servings were large. The side of bacon was an entire plate!  French toast was a little dry and nothing special. Corned beef hash was really greasy and was mostly meat, only a splash of potato. Bacon was really greasy as well. Everything kind of tasted the same - there wasn't much flavor.  Had the greasy belly feeling after eating. Wouldn't recommend. 2nd review - the woody Allen is huge! Definitely something to split. Open face pastrami/corned beef. I liked the combo of meats. Corned beef was better as it was moist. Pastrami was flavorful, but a little dry. The two mixed together complimented each other well.",

We knew things have drastically changed, not to our liking, but our old faithful CD was still there and we chose to take our family for some $25 sandwiches.    We got a Reuben and a Woody Allen, and an order of fries. Service was fine, we got extra bread promptly. First surprise was the sandwich was served with one sad, limp pickle! When last here, they served a separate pickle plate for the table, on which was a variety of spears, dills, half-sours, garlic dills, and all were crisp and obviously made in house. And they would bring more on request, which they still do. The pickles we were served I swear came out of a jar, so sad. Sandwiches were smaller (although quite large) than my recollection, and the corned beef was both tasteless and indelibly gristley, though pastrami was fine.   If we go back to LV, and I seriously doubt that we will, I would definitely go back to CD. But only for the French Fries! At $2.99 for a plateful, they were very good and a bargain.",

    "text": "Having always wanted to try either Carnegie or Katz Deli, stumbling on this place was a wonderful surprise. They just closed the original Carnegie in New York, so who knows how long this gem will be open.   My wife and I had the Matzah ball soup, and a Reuben.  The Reuben is big enough to easily feed two people, so don't be turned off by the price. Also, anything of any real quality in Vegas is going to priced astronomically price anyway (paid $23 for a margarita by the pool, cmon)... All that to say, I think $24.99 for a sandwich was an excellent deal.  They load about 2 pounds of meat onto the sandwich. Not chewy or grisly...It melts in your mouth. Easily the best Reuben I've ever had!  Please bless this old American institution with your business.  Hate to see the kosher-style deli's fade.",

Each sandwich alone will cost you $15-$25 that includes the sandwich and a pickle. No sides such as potato salad or cole slaw, that would cost you extra.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich.  The portion was a decent size and the chicken was seasoned fine.  But the mayo? Mayo overload!   The customer service was really great though. However, I can't justify the price. I'm sorry, but I will not return.",

Our sandwich came with a pile of sauerkraut and ooey gooey swiss cheese, and we made sure to drizzle hot mustard onto each bite, which made it have the perfect balance of flavor.  I believe this sandwich was $24.99 but if the price keeps increasing, I guess this visit will have probably been my only one.  Worth the try!",

It certainly was delicious and would be fantastic if you were unwell as this would certainly brighten your day. It had a great depth of flavour. I also had a Potato Pancake and this was served with Sour Cream. It was nice and crispy. I enjoyed it slathered with the sour cream.  I observed the pastrami sandwiches and they were massive.

Actually went the Monday after Thanksgiving 2015 and thankfully, at 9 in the evening, there was only one other guy in line.   After checking out the menu board, we decided on 2 Woody Allen corned beef and pastrami sandwich for $24.99 each + tax.  I would have never paid that much for 2 deli sandwiches, but my coupon reduced some of that pain considerably.  Unfortunately, the comp was only good for $21.  Oh well, no biggie.  We ordered our sandwiches to go.  The employee running the register was friendly, helpful, and in no time we were sitting in the to go area waiting for our sandwiches.  While we didn't actually eat in the restaurant, I did note it to be clean, pleasant, and had an upbeat and positive vibe.  I actually ate a portion of my sandwich after I got home.  I found the meat to be very tasty and totally amazed at how much meat was on this sandwich.  It was really massive!!  Well, it should be for $25 bucks.  The rest of the meat I put in the fridge and it will probably make an additional 3 or 4 more nice size sandwiches.  I would really like to go back and check out some of their other tasty offerings.  The cheesecake looked massive and very decadent.  Next time.",

My husband and I split the pastrami sandwich, fries and a strawberry cheesecake. The sandwich was doable, the fries...forget about finishing those, they're more for a table of 4+. So, as you can guess we ditched the fries and went for the cheesecake which was heavenly. Not the fluff that the Cheesecake factory serves, but a big dense flavorful NY style cheesecake...YUM!",

Much better deli in Montreal.  Others ordered a BLT to share.  Again, you can't eat it like a sandwich.  They left most of it on the plate.  Who wants to individually chew on some iceberg lettuce, turkey, bacon, and dry bread for 20 bucks.  The reason a BLT works is those go good together.

There is a $3 charge for sharing, which if you come to think about it, would not make it a bad deal if you both happen to want to partake of the same disgusting sandwich. The quality of the food and its size are in inverse proportion; our meat was dry, tasteless, visually revolting,  anchored by two slivers of bread to justify calling it a sandwich and not a chunk of dead dry beef. The worst sin was the chicken soup, that traditional icon of soothing relief; yellow liquid with a taste of having recently sprinkled or dissolved from an envelop or a cube, sodium being the preponderate flavor.

The two of us split a pastrami sandwich ($3 to split a sandwich) with enough left over to take back to our daughter for lunch as well.  It was the smaller of two sizes priced at $16 and was huge.

    "text": "Okay, so I've been to the Carnegie Deli in New York, and it is fantastic. I was staying that the mirage and remembered how awesome the New York location was and decided I had to take my girlfriend there. Wrong Decision. This place was awful in comparison to the New York location.  The food was okay, which is not saying much for Carnegie, because the New York location has FANTASTIC food. I'm also a little peeved because in NY, you can get the Blintzes with their fruit toppings, and we couldn't here. That was the first strike, since Blintzes at Carnegie are amazing. I had the Corned Beef Hash and my girlfriend had the Thick Cut Ham and 3 eggs with home fries. I was really expecting a lot out of the hash because they are known for their amazing Pastrami and Corned Beef. Wasn't impressed. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. It wasn't bad flavor, but there wasn't much there to taste. It seemed like the way they cooked it took the flavor out of the corned beef. Maybe I should have gone with the Pastrami Hash, but who knows? Anyways, my girlfriends meal was definitely better than mine, much more on par with the breakfast I expected at Carnegie. The ham was cooked and had a nice caramelization going on. The fried eggs over easy were cooked perfectly, but the home fries just weren't that great. The inside was a little dry and the outside was a little soggy without much flavor. That was probably the most disappointing part for me because I absolutely love good home fries.  Next, the service. The service here is bad, especially in comparison to NY. I hate to keep comparing it to NY, but if you are going to use their name, it's gonna happen. In NY, the employees seemed happy, lots of smiles, friendly, and it was like they enjoyed working their. Here, I didn't see a single smile and every employee looked like they wanted to punch someone in the face. Our server asked us what we wanted to eat like 3 times in the first 2 minutes we were there, but we needed a bit to decide, and they didn't return for 20 more minutes. I said a needed a couple minutes, not 20. The kicker, though, was at the end of the meal. In case you couldn't tell from other reviews, the portions are HUGE here. So, I obviously had some of my hash left over (about a third of it) and wanted a box. When I asked for a box, the server asked \"Are you serious?\" and looked at me like I was an idiot. No, I was joking! You caught me! (Sarcasm).  In conclusion, don't go to Carnegie unless you are in New York. Walk the extra 20 feet down the hallway and go to BLT Burger, where you will not be disappointed.",

I will NEVER  return........ It wasn't worth it !",

So I was very excited when I saw that they opened on in Las Vegas, which I frequent much more often than New York.  Unfortunately, on top of being ridiculously expensive, the sandwich was extremely dry with no flavor.  I actually split a turkey and pastrami sandwich and couldn't even finish half the sandwich, it was just too dry.  On top of being a very poor sandwich, it costs also $25 before tax and tip.  $17 for the turkey sandwich, $5 to add Pastrami and $3 to share.",

I love cheese, so it's rare that I end up having to scrape some of it aside, like I did in this case. Generous portions, so all the food here was actually a good value. It was perfect after leaving Jet, and kinda sobered me up, so I was ready to head back out again afterwards. Great stop during a great night out!",

We had a few questions for the waiter about some items and found out that unless you specify, everything comes bare bone unless you pay extra. To the point of adding sour cream to the baked potato or lettuce on your sandwich. We ordered our food and 25 minutes later my wife's tuna sandwich showed up. 10 minutes after that three of the burgers showed up and only a few minutes later my \"hot pastrami\" sandwich came out. My sandwich was warm at best and it wasn't until we were all almost finished eating that I realized I never received my potato. I reminded the waiter at which point he went back and got it. When he dropped it off there was no sorry for he delay or anything. I thought about sending it back, but at that point we just wanted to split. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.

The food is great, huge portions, and they are open 24 hours. The food also came out pretty quickly, even at 3 AM. However, on our last day we ate there for lunch with 8 people. We were seated immediately, even though only 4of us were there. The other 4 arrived less than 5 minutes later. We asked for 8 waters, and received a total of 5. We then had to wait 30 minutes for a server to come to us. I had to stand up and walk to the hostess and ask her to send a server to our table. He got us the remaining waters and then we had to wait another 20 minutes before we even placed our order. The table of 6 next to us arrived after, ate, and paid before we even got our food. I complained to the manager, who then sent the waiter over again. The manager told the waiter we complained, in our presence. The waiter came over and instead of apologizing, argued with us that he had come over shortly after our whole party had arrived. We were all taken aback that not only did the manager tell the waiter of our complaint in front of us while we were eating but also that the waiter tried to argue with us that he was right. At the end, it took us an hour and a half to eat here, and nothing was comped from the bill. Eating in is a disaster, I would give it one star based solely on that experience. I would recommend taking out from here.",

The place was super clean, the staff was friendly, they brought a dish of pickles to our table almost as soon as we sat down and, oh yes, the food was fantastic. I started with chicken soup. It's really just broth, no chunks of chicken or veggies. You can get it with egg noodles or rice (I went with rice). I was brought a bowl of rice and a small metal pitcher of broth. It was delicious. Then I had a turkey and swiss on rye with mashed potatoes. The potatoes tasted like homemade and the sandwich was just what you'd expect in a deli, tasty rye bread piled high with tender, flavorful white meat turkey and Swiss cheese. It was big. Light eaters might want to share one. I polished mine off with no problem, but I had no room for dessert. Next time I will. This place is going into the Vegas rotation, for sure.",

My bride and I ordered a reuben and an extra plate for $3.  A mountainous sandwich soon arrived, and we split it three ways, one of which we did not touch.  The texture and taste was very appealing.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.    A couple of guys sat down next to us, and did not perform the same diligence that we had.  They both ordered the same thing, and finished about half.

Finished it off with a Cheesecake/tort. Again, had better in NYC at Juniors, but not at all bad.   I had high expectations going here, read something about the owner of Carnegie flying out to Vegas and overseeing the operation on a regular basis. For what they are charging, the food did not deliver.   If it were just a regular deli in Las Vegas with better prices, I'd give it more stars.",

When I went there in October 2010, I saw the size of the sandwiches and was intimidated, so since I was there during breakfast I ordered an omelette instead.  I tried the pastrami omelette and for $12.99 I got a huge omelette with yummy pastrami, home fries and toast.  Definitely worth the price.  This time when I went I was going to try the sandwich , but once again I was intimiated with I saw 2 pretty big guys (big meaning 2 men that were over 6 feet tall & they were in shape) sharing 1 sandwich and they couldn't even finish it.  So once again I ordered an omelette.  This time I tried the corned beef omelette, with home fries and toast for $12.99 and once I again I enjoyed my meal.    The food is good, the portion are huge for the price and the service was good.  One day I'll have the courage to try the sandwich.",

As a local we would frequent this restaurant quite often. A family favorite!!!! Haven't been for a while and now will never go back. It's another case of \"I'm soooo smart that I'm going to take an iconic restaurant and change everything!!\" Well it is horrible. The first encouter after a long wait is with a cashier with no personality. Now you place your order and pay. Of course there is a line for tip but I have no idea what level of service I will be getting!?. Now you pick a table (open seating). It took 10min for anyone to acknowledge us and clear the table from previous guests. Another 10 minutes before our waitress shows up. The pickles arrive (my absolute favorite) but are now some hideous flavorless green things. The sandwiches are smaller (but cost the same). Reading other reviews indicates the awesome cheesecake has also been changed. We didn't want to stand in line again to find out!!! The menu is a fraction of original menu. The whole family was dissapointed and we will not b going back. Too bad........such an incredible place turned to crap by someone who is smarter than the rest of us. The NYC location should be ashamed to share the same name...",

I'm not sure what brand it was, but had a nice flavor. Maybe a little Dijon added to it, but still a brown deli mustard and not the grey poupon they were trying to pass off for the last couple of years. I got the $22 Ruben and had them make it half pastrami and half corned beef. Although the menu says no substitutions, my waitress managed to pull it off for me. But no guarantees that you can order it that way in the future. The pastrami side was a little more juicy than the corned beef side. This Ruben can't be finished by one person, I gave it a good go and got through about 2/3rds of it before giving up. It really is for sharing. I asked the waitress if anyone has ever finished one, she said no. Now I'm sure one of those Nathan's Hot Dog eating champions could do it. But for your normal big eater, it's not going to happen. I've even finished the Woody Allen a few times. But this Ruben and it's 8 thick slices of melted swiss cheese covering corned beef that is 4\" thick on a plate that is about 12\" long. Add about an inch of sauerkraut and serve it on 4 slices of rye bread...enough said.   This Carnegie is still not as good as the original, but still pretty darn good.",

Now let me say this first, what initially drew me in was the cakes and pastries on STEROIDS in their pastry case at the take-out counter. Muffins, cookies, cakes, pies, you name it. They're huge and looked deee-lish.   Being as the line for a table was quite long and we were limited on time, we opted for take out. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The service was quick so we were in and out.  The food did not disappoint, either. I'm under the assumption (based on other reviews and pictures) that the portions are quite large for all their dishes (not just the pastries and desserts staring you in the face). My bacon and egg sandwich was massive and delicious I couldn't believe I finished the whole thing.  Return visit? Yes, definitely. I want to actually sit down & eat here. But don't say I didn't warn you.... Come Hungry! In fact, come starving! And save room for dessert ;)",

Also tried the \"Julienne Child\" chef salad.  Very odd that the nothing in the salad was \"julienne,\" but huge ginormous pieces of meat, cheese, and eggs.  The meat was delicious, but it my mind it wasn't a chef salad because it was more like a meat, cheese, and veggie tray.  After we ordered, a small bowl of pickles was placed on our table.  To be honest, I'm not a fan of the pickles AT ALL.  They had a weird aftertaste to them.  (Also annoying that they would charge an extra $3.00 to share a plate when most people can hardly finish a sandwich alone.)",

The cost of a sandwich would be about the same as being in New York City at Second Ave Deli. BTW, you can't order a smaller version of a sandwich for a cheaper price. And, if you split a sandwich (recommended) then yet another charge is added on top! When you add it all up, you will be disappointed if not mad at yourself afterwards.   The logical choice is to go somewhere else, which is easy to do in Las Vegas.    Best to all,",

I really don't know where to begin.  There was a very big change for the worst from last year.  We ordered with a limited menu, when we got to the register after ordering, we were handed our bill which we paid and a tray.  We had to carry our tray to the many empty tables.  The empty tables should have been a sign to us, but the Carnegie Deli name, we trusted.  Well, after waiting about 25 minutes our extreme cold pastrami sandwiches arrived to our table.  Tuna sandwiches had no mayo on them. The pickles were so sour and old looking.  No cole slaw, which we enjoyed very much.  We tried to get the waiters attention and tell him our problem, so he took back our pastrami sandwiches.  The pastrami sandwiches came back so dry, they were like shoe leather, not hot like we requested.  They were barely lukewarm.  Didn't want to have it heated again because it was already dry, like shoe leather not moist at all.  We definitely wasted our money.  What a HORRIBLE experience!!!  We will never eat there again.  We are also going to spread the word about our experience to my family and friends not to dine there, why waste their good money.  Live and learn the hard way.  The Carnegie Deli will not survive at this rate.",

Great that it was thin so you can really taste the pastrami. Sandwich is huge and cost $16.99.  Hope you can try it. I may try the Woody Allen next time, see what the hype is about.

Speaking first to my favorite 'appetizer,' the $8.50 slice of carrot cake proved competent and not overly sweet, but perhaps as a result of our early morning visit and a cake from last night the crumb delivered slightly dry and under-spiced - the impressive cream cheese icing thankfully buoying the dish, though none of it nearly as impressive as the $13.95 fried cheese blintzes whose light eggy tones and balanced parts savory meets sweet proved excellent on their own, yet far better with house-made applesauce taken bite-for-bite.  Eschewing  meats or omelets, though all looked good, it was in a Jewish deli's Challah that I placed my trust for a 'main course' and with three thick slices soaked in batter, fried golden in butter, and drowned in maple syrup I really could not have asked for more, the stack a veritable bargain at $10.95.",

I then said,  \"I would like to add the cheesecake.\" I paid my bill and when I was looking I noticed that he charged me $10.99 for it.  I went back L,  waited for him to go is with his current customer. I talked to him and then he blamed me because he said I didn't ask to be charged the 5.50 cheesecake.  I pointed out the sign said \"add cheese cake for 5.50\".  He was a complete here about it. He wanted to rip us off. He said then said fine, said he would have to get a manner. Pushed my receipt to the side and called for the next customer.  I'm standing there confused but he then spent 10 mins with the next person.  At this point,  I'm PISSED. He then hands me the new receipt and calls for the next person. He said not a word to me.  I looked at him asked for my old receipt and said that's it. No explanation.  He basically just charged me again for all of know.  I marched to the manager at CPK and give him my piece of mind. I know it wasn't his fault but the situation was ridiculous.  The manager comped the cheesecake but I was ready to just walk out.  I should have because the food wasn't great.  The sandwich was huge but the meat was dry. Nothing really special. The cheese cake was a thin sliver and was only OK.  The food is forgettable. The waiter was nice. The cashier (Mihai) was HORRIBLE.  I will not be going back.  Save yourself and go elsewhere.",

While truthfully speaking, most of this night was a haze and blur of tequila and beer, so I can't quite remember much but I do remember seeing the bright deli counter and little to no line of Carnegie, and my drunken stomach telling me it needed carbs and protein.   My buddy and I somehow made it to the counter, placed our orders, 2 pastrami breakfast sandwiches, and patiently waited what felt like hours (only 15 minutes) while our order was being made. TICK TOCK TICK TOCK, my watch goes by as my vision blurs more and more. FINALLY my sandwich is made and we hurriedly rush back to our room across the street and devour our sanwiches and pass out.  What I see in the morning is two torn and empty sandwich wrappers and dirty napkins everywhere. Apparently, I liked the sandwich a lot.",

This REUBEN is so humungo that you can't even see the bread under the layers of meat. Amazing !  Good for maybe 3 people ? But i was greedy and ate  half myself and took the rest togo.   Here is another delish meal... the Tuna Melt.. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wEqiDS9FddipHnhCxLk3pQ&userid=eqiFJ7qkX5dgwgooJ4SdGg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>... not as gigantic as the Reuben but equally good.

If you like Pastrami, definitely give this place a try...their sandwich is like a mile high...SERIOUSLY!!! They'll also give you extra bread to break down the meat...and their homemade dill pickles are the perfect complement to the pastrami.  The prices were a little all over the place.  I ordered a hot open-faced roast beef sandwich, which was like $20!!! while the mile-high pastrami, as well as many other sandwich faves, ran about $14.   My fiance ordered a cheeseburger, and that looked kinda crappy...while the corned beef and the pastrami omelettes were pretty tasty (try adding mushrooms and cheese...yum).  Their dessert display was eye-catching...the cheescakes were GINORMOUS!!! Way more than a foot in diameter, all flushed with strawberries...yummy.  If you're living the Vegas life, and dont have the patience to sit and eat, they also do take out.  A couple of times, I just woke-up, went downstairs, ordered an omelette, and took it back upstairs to share with my fiance.  They're pretty fast too...I placed my order, went next door to Starbucks, and when I came back, it was pretty much read-to-go!  Definitely a  good place to try for breakfast or lunch!",

It's a little pricey, but if you're in Vegas you HAVE to order this sandwich. I wouldn't get ANYTHING else on the menu! Especially that pastrami sandwich with egg or whatever that crap is.   The original pastrami sandwich is again the ONLY thing you should be ordering from this place. That and extra pickles! This place was just SOOOO delicious because of that one sandwich. Again! Don't order ANYTHING else! I recommend eating half the sandwich and then taking the other half to go so that you can eat it after your drunk!  And to all you dumbies who didn't give this place 4-5 stars... YOU ARE RETARDED! You didn't order what this place is famous for! That's why I can't emphasize enough just get the original pastrami sandwich. DON'T BE A CHEAPO and think you can order a sandwich with pastrami and something else just because it's a couple bucks cheaper. You're already in Vegas! Splurge a little and get the real deal!",

The fact that regardless of the place, regardless of the 14 oz of meant, $14.95 for a roast beef sandwich is BEYOND ridiculous.  And what does it come with? Meat and bread.  BUT WAIT! Thats not all!  For only $1.50 extra, you can get a slice of cheese.  And for $1 extra, you can have lettuce and tomato.  ...wtf?  I LOVE roast beef sandwiches. Absolutely love them. I was not aware it was possible to make a bad roast beef sandwich.  This was definitely the WORST sandwich I have ever had, in any variety.  First of all, the roast beef did not taste like anything. It was bizarre. It tasted like water.  And the issue with Vegas is the concept of less is more is OUT THE WINDOW.  We had to completely de-construct the sandwich before we could even take a bite. There was nearly a pound of roast beef ROLLED into a huge roll and slapped on these squirrely pieces of bread.   Not to mention there was a half a pound of iceberg lettuce and white onion. What DELI doesnt offer red onion??  It was such a disappointment. Especially since the bf had really wanted a pastrami sandwich, which is also never bad, which I vetoed because I had a queasy belly and wanted something with a little less flavor. NOT SOMETHING WITH NO FLAVOR.  It was just an absolute failure. Depression and a failure. ):",

I feel like their french fries could single-handedly solve world peace.   The service is not so good. I felt like an imposition the entire time I was there. Maybe it was because I looked like hell from the night before. But it's not like they shouldn't be used to that. It is Vegas, after all.",

The service was relatively good.  Waiters were attentive and came around often enough, but the food was simply subpar - especially for the price.  I wasn't feeling too hungry at the time, so I ordered a BLT.  I thought it would be a safe bet seeing how much meat was loaded on the sandwiches around me. Bad move! There was just as much meat in my sandwich...to the point where I had no idea how I was going to eat it... and at the halfway point... I couldn't bare to eat anymore... chances are, my heart would have stopped with another bite.  Overall, meh. It's a fine novelty, I will admit, but why it's at the Mirage and not New York, New York, I don't understand.  I would recommend sharing a sandwich with another person because someone with an average appetite is not likely to finish even half of their meal.  It helps the environment to not waste food and it also helps with saving money (who knows, the money you save may turn into a win at the roulette table. ;] ).",

    "text": "As I mentioned in a previous review, Carnegie Deli is my all-time favorite for hot pastrami.  I've had the others and in New York City, Carnegie reigns supreme...in my book, it is the holy grail of hot pastrami, almost a religious experience every time I dine there.  I love the hot pastrami on rye there (the only thing to order other than cheesecake) so much that I have been known to cab it there to have some while en route to a really fancy and expensive business dinner.  Yes, I love it that much.  Can you say revered?  I have been wanting to try the Vegas outlet of Carnegie Deli in the Mirage ever since it opened, but for the last three trips, I somehow just never made it there.  This time I was determined and was there for lunch within an hour of my arrival.  I ordered the hot pastrami (with pickles and mustard on the side) and it was everything I had hoped for.    The sandwich was crazy tall and huge...you could barely get your mouth around it as it was so big.  The pastrami was so incredibly flavorful and juicy, just like at the Carnegie in New York City.  The sandwich was $15.95, but I was in total heaven.  It is exactly like that at the original location, the only difference being that it seemed just a touch spicier at the Vegas location which was just fine with me.  The service was great too.    Struck up a conversation with an elderly couple next to me who did not know what to order and they ended up having the same thing and loved it.  The people at the other table noticed that they ordered it and started telling us how much they loved the hot pastrami here.  It was a recurring theme throughout the meal and it was as though we were all on a pilgrimage for hot pastrami sandwiches.    Believe it or not, I ate the whole thing and was full for hours.  I actually had to postpone dinner and even then made it a super light one because of my sandwich at Carnegie.  When I finished eating, I remember saying to myself that I could die happy right now. That is one heckuva sandwich!",

But it is Open 24 hrs and the food is good but the service was HORRIBLE! Mind you, we had a lot to drink and maybe our server didn't think we would notice, but even when I'm tipsy I expect decent service.  First, he took more than 15 minutes to greet us, then another 10 to take our orders which came out I feel 45 minutes later. I ordered fries with my sandwich, which I didn't receive, and 3 people didn't get their side of rice with their meals either. To make up for it we asked to speak to the manager who was nice and offered us a free cheesecake which we refused to take we just wanted our server to know HE SUCKED!  Anyways, I ordered the egg sandwich ($9.95) which did not come with any sides but it was HUGE! They are not skimpy on any of the food portions and the eggs were fluffy and fresh! My bf ordered the woody Allen ($19.99) and it was HUGE! This thing was probably a good 6 inches high of pastrami and corned beef meat between two white slices of bread. And my bf can eat; he had to take the other half to go. One night her ordered the corned beef hash ($19.99) and LOVED it, another big portion of food as well. You can get an egg on top any way you like.  This place is pretty pricey ($7 orange juice!) but when it's the only thing open at 4am you have to make it work.  We went here 3 times during our stay in Vegas so it must be that good.",

We look around, see this small cafeteria like deli, thought, that place MUST be reasonable. We sit down and order a \"simple\" pastrami sandwich, cheeseburger. Then we asked if it came with fries, she said separate - she wasn't kidding a small plate for 10.99 -- yikes!  Pastrami was a pound of meat between two slices of bread, cheeseburger - very bland, and the fries look the same as Jack In The Boxe's curly fries.  Not impressed -- what was the kicker is the $45 bill for those three items.  I would not recommend this for a quick snack, I could have taken a cab and ate for that price.",

The waitress declined to state that adding cheese to a sandwich was an extra $1.50 and lettuce & tomato was an extra $1.00.  She also somehow heard \"turkey sandwich\" when I unmistakeably said corned beef.  The restaurant was *not busy* and there were tons of waiters working, but we never got our pickles even though other tables around us did, so I finally had to ask for them.  I don't know what was going on that night, but a bunch of the waiters appeared to be getting into an argument right by our table.  And then I got to watch my corned beef sandwich go cold on the service counter for 10 whole minutes until the waitress finally brought it over.  Because I'd added cheese and lettuce and was splitting with a friend, my tepid sandwich ended up costing over $20.  BEFORE TIP.  I hope this restaurant burns down!!!!  Also, I had a bite of my friend's cheesecake.  It was thick and heavy as a brick and the crust tasted like chalk.  How much more clear can I be than to say DON'T EAT HERE!",

It is a giant pastrami sandwich probably a good 10inches tall or more. 2 people have to eat because each side is a meal in itself. The pastrami was wet but not too wet, and had just the right amount of saltiness. We put tobasco and honey mustard on it and knocked the tower down and just went thru it with a fork. It's so good i crave it now actually.   We also ordered potato salad, which paired well with the pastrami'ness.   This place is now the basis of comparison of my pastrami travels and will probably hold number 1. IF YOU ARE IN VEGAS YOU MUST GET THIS.

If your stomach is needing some love after a long night out on the town, I highly recommend the Matzah ball soup with an order of latkes. I have yet to have a meal from here I didn't enjoy.   Despite the fact that I eat here religiously every time I'm in Vegas, I didn't give it 5 stars because it seems as though they still can't work out all the kinks. The line issue has gotten better, now that they take your order at the counter and bring you your food (instead of a server coming and then having to place the order with the kitchen, etc), but it's still pretty slow. We waited for nearly 30 minutes after ordering our food, which is pretty long when you're that hungry and have already been waiting in line to order.   Also, on my way out of town I tried to place an order to go over the phone, which they don't accept apparently. So I showed up, stood in line, and finally 30 minutes later got my food. I realized they were busy so it wasn't a huge deal, but once I got to the car and ready to head out of town, they only gave me half of my order. I was pretty bummed because I was looking forward to enjoying some delicious latkes during my departure from my beloved city. They are so close to mastering the service piece at this restaurant. Regardless, I will remain loyal and recommend to all... just be prepared the wait and don't go when you're HANGRY.",

We ordered pastrami for breakfast which was almost $20 and it was soooo oily, overcooked and killed the pastrami by chopping it into pieces. It didnt come with eggs and slice of bread!  We asked for a slice bread and the waitress said we didnt order it with bread. The one egg was already an additional cost. Yikes. What kind of breakfast is that? The waitress was rude and no class. I was hoping that since it was the Mirage one would have good service but none of that. Coffee was additional too. Carnegie deli is a rip off.",

    "text": "I was with a group of four people. We had just arrived to Las Vegas from Vancouver, Canada and decided to go for a bite. We all decided on Carnegie because of its reviews on yelp and because we saw all these pictures of celebrities hanging on the walls. It will cost you around $15 for JUST a sandwich. Or $15 for half a sandwich with a drink and side. I got the half combo, roast beef sandwich on sourdough. When it came it was huge. But it came completely dry, just meat and bun. (I asked for no lettuce or tomato but thought some kind of sauce came on it). All in all, I still ate the sandwich and it wasn't horrible I just wish that it would have included more bang for your buck. I probably won't return for two reasons. One is I feel like you should get more food for $15, and the second is that the women who we paid was very rude and distracted.",

    "text": "My last hoorah in Vegas...just before heading home, we had to have lunch at Carnegie Deli at the mirage. Unfortunately because it was located at the back of the casino, the restaurant was pretty smokey.   Our wait, at 11am on a Sunday morning was about 15 minutes. We came for a huge corned beef and pastrami appetite, but most of the food coming out of the kitchen was breakfast.  My husband and I shared a stuffed derma, (2 large pieces on the dish). One of the best I've tasted...nice and crispy along the casing. We shared a matzoh ball soup. I remember Carnegie serving a softball sized matzoh ball years ago, now it's served with 2 smaller ones. Good chicken stock and very tasty and fluffy matzoh balls. We then shared a Woody Allen (corned beef and pastrami). Huge! Delicious! even better when paired with mustard and pickles.  My husband ordered an egg cream, and he said it was excellent...  Service was horrible, at least our server was. I had to ask for pickles, silverware, our drinks (waited about 10 minutes after ordering).  Tables are really tiny and you can hear every conversation intimately, as the tables are pushed really close together in this tiny place....just like in NYC.  If traveling by car, this should be your last stop, because the sandwiches have about 2 lbs. of meat in them, you'll want to grab a doggie bag to bring home with you.  The two of us ate for just under $50....which by Vegas standards is pretty cheap!",

Last time I ate here was in March 2014, the worst. I had the salad platter - three different types of salads: cole slaw, shrimp and chicken. I noticed that they don't offer the shrimp anymore, probably a good choice. I'm pretty sure that's what did me in. It tasted a little funny at the time. I should have known.  About 40 minutes after eating here, the cramps started. By the time I made it back to my room, my entire body was rejecting lunch. It was one of the most horrific experiences I have ever had. I have had food poisoning before, but nothing even close to this...I was stuck in my room for 14 hours straight with all the symptoms. In retrospect, I should have gone to the ER, but it was difficult to think straight with everything I was experiencing.   I would highly recommend avoiding this place.",

    "text": "What can I say??  It was truly love at first bite.  Ever since I took my first bite of the pastrami sandwich here, I've been a fan and have made it a point to dine here if I'm in Vegas.  Located on the casino level of The Mirage, the restaurant is open 24 hours (very convenient!) and serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.    I come here for just thing:  The pastrami sandwich.  Well, mind you there are other things to try on the menu....sandwiches named after celebrities, a variety of sides, or perhaps their monstrous Mount Everest sized slices of cheescake.  Alas, usually there's no room left in my stomach for dessert (as much as I want to try the cheescake!) after attempting to devour my sandwich.  Priced a somewhat reasonable $15.95, the pastrami sandwich is....what can I say....simply delicious and a meat lovers dream.  Make sure to enjoy your meal with the pickles and mustard (now in squeeze bottles!) available.  Your taste buds will be thanking you....trust me.  SERVICE:  The service is great!  Everyone from the hostess, server, and bus boys are friendly, attentive, out-going, and polite.  Great customer service overall.  Bottom Line:  Craving a taste of New York?  When in Vegas, Carnegie Deli is where it's at!",

    "text": "I will also share what other viewers are also saying.  The service was very poor.  I went with a friend, we ordered our food.  She got her hot sandwich and french fries, will I sat and waited for my cold sandwich to be delivered.  I continued to sit while wait staff walked past my sandwich sitting on the counter waiting to be delivered.  Finally a waitress stopped by and asked if I had gotten my order yet and I told her no, she went and got the sandwich.  Since I have never been to this establishment, I did not realize that there was no mayo or mustard on the sandwiches.  So again, waiting for attention from the staff, finally ask a waitress for some Mayo.  She says okay and then starts to clean 3 tables before going to get some Mayo.  There was one waitress at the end of our visit that was really friendly and helpful, the rest were just completely useless.  Is this not a service industry?  Why are so many customers complaining?  Customers are paying a lot of money for a SANDWICH, at least we can be served with a smile and a little kindness?",

    "text": "This location in The Mirage Hotel and Casino is based off the famous Carnegie Deli in NYC. The sandwiches and desserts do not lose any of their size here though. Nope... still huge.   Ordering is quite simple. Just place your order at the counter and take a buzzer before grabbing a seat. I have no idea what the buzzer was for since a server brought our meals to the table and took our little device before it even went off.   The sandwiches are most definitely large enough to split. My husband and I had a buy one get one offer through our MyVegas rewards, so we each bravely got our own sandwich. We knew we wouldn't have any room for sides or desserts so we didn't bother with anything else. Beware... though the portions are big, they are pricey. Our two sandwiches and two drinks cost $44. However, after using our BOGO offer and a casino comp, our total came down to just $0.00. That's my kind of bill. ;)   I had turkey on sourdough with all the regular garden toppings and my husband had a plain turkey and bacon on wheat. Each had a full pound of meat. It was good, but tasted just like any other turkey sandwich I'd ever had in my life... there was just more of it. My husband bet me that I couldn't finish half of it and I proved him wrong by cleaning my entire plate. I'm a tiny girl with an appetite, so Carnegie definitely delivered when it came to satisfying my hunger. Now, can you complete the challenge?",

    "text": "\"That is an absurd amount of cheese.\"  And cheese was not the primary ingredient.  You see, the Reuben is served open face and the plentiful melted cheese hides all of the other ingredients, including the two slices of bread in there somewhere.     Ignore the haters, the Carnegie Deli is a great place to get a huge sandwich and it's really not that expensive.    You see, the second you step into Las Vegas you should expect to spend at least $20 on a meal and considering these sandwiches EASILY FEED TWO and mostly go for $12-17 except for a few larger for $20, I actually consider this a decent value.    The burger place across the hall will happily sell you a meal for one for about 20d.    Carnegie also manages a few accomplishments.   Strangely this might be the only rye bread I like.   The service is easily friendlier and faster than the ACTUAL Carnegie Deli in NYC and there was no line on my visit to boot.    I love the ridiculousness of the massive sandwiches of the Carnegie Deli, a regular stop whenever I'm in New York.  Now I might say the same for my trips to Vegas.",

Doesn't solve any problems , and creates a lesser tip income for their servers.   They took the potato knish off the menu. Bad move. And the chicken soup was really sub-par, with not so good matzoh balls.   Well, they lost a customer, unless they change back.   I'll have to go to New York.",

    "text": "2 months ago, this rating would be five stars.  I have been coming here for years, twice a year like clockwork. Not only did Mirage change this Carnegie Deli from a sit down restaurant to a pay-first-and-sit-only-after-ordering-and-paying Sizzler style place, they took great food items off the menu and they CHEAPENED the quality of the food that is left remaining on the menu.  No more knishes on the menu...and that's just a start...  They cheapened the matzo ball soup...no longer golden and no longer perfectly seasoned...it's watered down...they try to hide the lower quality with a few bits onions and a speck of carrot here and there.  I can't say that it's swill, but I wouldn't order it again...and I used to order it every time every visit.  The matzo ball itself? Well, it's adequate...a bit lumpy, a bit cold ... Nothing to be proud of...hence no reason to order.   The portions were still large, the quality of the pastrami okay...not as good as I remember, but unless you are a New Yorker, you won't notice.  It's a step above Denny's pastrami, I'll grant them that.  And that's what they are counting on...save a little here and there, cheapen the food...and they hope you won't notice.  The really stupid part about the change from sit down restaurant to this flush them through approach is that the ordering from a waitress wasn't what took  the longest time, it's the food prep...so the wait in line, order, pay, then sit down system doesn't solve any throughput problem.  The genius who made this change needs to go back to business school and take queuing theory...or at least read the book, The Goal.   It takes the same amount of time from start to finish just with cheaper food, fewer choices and angry patrons.  Way to go, Mirage.  Carnegie Deli in NYC should take note of the damage Mirage is inflicting on the Carnegie Deli brand.    I hope they change it back to a sit down restaurant with higher quality food...If they don't bring back the complete menu, so be it, but the quality of food needs to improve back to its former levels.   Otherwise this visit will be the last time I will stay at the Mirage hotel and the last time I eat at this Carnegie Deli...yes, that bad.    Go somewhere else anywhere else, you'll have a better experience.",

While nowhere near the quality of the NYC Carnegie's or any other 'real' deli, it was serviceable however and showed off the ridiculously huge, albeit pricey, portions that the deli is famous for delivering.  We had lunch here one day and they were receptive to my off menu order of a combo pastrami and turkey sandwich.  It was crazy big, to the point that our table neighbors ooohd and aaahd as it landed.  I ate almost half of it and wound up getting the other half to go and giving it to a homeless man on the street.  My son got a bacon and egg bagel sandwich which was equally ginormous and he did a nice job eating most of the thing.  We also had breakfast on our last day in town and again, it was pricey, with huge portions and tasty.  If I was only rating breakfast, I would have given this review 4 stars I think.  Service was a little inattentive and gruff but got the job done overall given how busy the place was for both meals.",

The Real Original Carnegie Deli is Closed but they do source the Meats and Cheesecakes from Carnegie Warehouse in New York.   *******I DO WARN YOU******** The sandwiches are VERY OVER STUFFED  (like 2 pounds of meat that feed 4 hungry people) and all the portions are EXTRA LARGE.  This restaurant is different than it was several years back. They used to serve you bowls of pickles and they no longer do that........and they used to give you the extra bread for your extra sandwiches....Now you have to ask for the bread.  We shared a Woody Allen Sandwich (Corned Beef and Pastrami) and a Potato Knish. The sandwich is ENORMOUS. Sadly the bread is very non-authenic as it's squishy like white bread with a few caraway seeds. Both meats are better than what my local supermarket sells but....Both meats are sort of dry and not succulent. They also aren't real flavorful like really good corn beef and especially good pastrami is...I also would prefer is the pastrami didn't have so much added smoke flavoring. They also only give you one pickle to share.  We also tried a potato knish. Again not the best tasting most flavorful knish but it's very large and is ok.  The sandwich is too much for two people. You need at least 4 HUNGRY people to eat the sandwich.  Ask for the extra bread for your leftovers.  Pretty cheap eats for the Vegas Strip. $25.00 buys at least 4 meals.",

So as I still had my bags in my hand I decided to get a sandwich in hopes that it's half as good as the one in NY. Boy I was in shock, Vegas Carnegie might be even better. My Reuben was perfect; tons and tons of corned beef, cheese melted to perfection and creamy thousand island. I'm almost upset over how good it was because now I have to go back, and I wanted to try all different things. See you soon Carnegie!",

It is used to be huge, so much so that he could barely eat it or wrap his mouth around it. That is not the case any longer bit is still large but not what it used to be. I got the tuna salad sandwich and was disappointed. It was huge but who needs a pound of tuna on two thin slices of wheat toast?  And really, $13 for tuna sandwich?  With no sides included in price?  Come on...  It had no flavor and was very dry. We always enjoy the French fries but those orders have shrunk a little also.   The biggest reason that I gave them only 3 stars is the change in the last few years to you ordering on your own and not having a waitress/waiter take your order. Why?  Because first, if I want another beer I can't get it and second because I have to tip the person anyways but feel like I did the work.   Last thing, I always want to try the cheesecake but $13 for a slice is outrageous.   I will likely go back and get ripped off for sandwiches again just because it is convenient and my friend likes the Blt.",

They are the carnivore's version of peanut butter and jelly.  Slather your bread with some deli mustard and mayo.  I found that it was a little dry without the mayo.  The housemade pickles are always a nice great.    Their New York cheesecake is very delicious.  The cheesecake is so fluffy and moist, unlike others that have a dense cheesecake.  One of the best I've ever had.    The Woody Allen will set you back around $25 and Cheesecake around $11.",

Service was excellent and attentive so definitely no complaints here.  Place was nice and clean and got inside the restaurant before the lunch crowd showed up.

If you have a big appetite and love pastrami, get the Woody Allen.   I walked by here a few years ago and knew I wanted to stop by. There was no doubt that I would order pastrami but after getting my daughter's feedback, I knew I made the right decision by offering 1 Woody Allen for us to share (economical, too!), a side of sausages for Gavin, and a plate of fries for us to share.   Sodium overload.   The order took less than 10 minutes to arrive at our table. I did not even get a chance to oogle over their line of desserts. So as you can see from the picture, the thing is as big as my skull. The spicy brown mustard wasn't spicy but it added an element to the pastrami to dissipate the saltiness. The bread wasn't toasted which is how it is usually served, and I love the pickles. The pastrami was tender but the sandwich was dry overall. Maybe layers of the brown mustard would have been a better outcome for me. The fries were delicious.   The guy that took my order and rung me was up wasn't friendly but our server was fast and thorough. Thank you for refilling our waters hella fast.   Glad I tried it. I'll stick to The Refuge in San Carlos.",

Let me start by saying the sandwiches are HUGE!   Every time I come I get the famous Reuben. It is huge and so worth the money. This one sandwich ended up feeding two people for two meals. I highly recommend the Reuben if you were only to get one thing here.  I have also tried the chicken noodle soup and it was surprisingly good. The noodles were a little squishy, the way I personally like it, and the soup was quite tasty.   The second time I ate here my family opted for the brisket sandwich, Reuben, the burger, and fries. The Brisket Sandwich was fantastic! I normally find Brisket to be dry, but the meat on the sandwich was moist and tasted amazing. I will definitely order it again the next time I visit.   The wait staff is fantastic, and the overall vibe of the restaurant is casual. I will be back for more of their fantastic sandwiches!",

Before more of a latke. This time more of a giant hash brown.  Egg plate with ham was great. Another huge portion. Would definitely order that again for a fairly priced breakfast.

Friends got pastrami and a rueben and it was just a huge amount of food. They seemed happy with it though. During a previous trip, I tried the chopped liver sandwich and matzo ball soup and really enjoyed both. Plenty of dining space inside. Perhaps it was a quieter time and tables were close together, but we got some dirty looks from (older) folks because we were probably being too loud and rowdy. Oh well, it's Vegas.",

They served the Rueben open style, which just means there's no top bun. You can eat it with a fork and knife or just with your hands. The cheese is a nice bitter swiss, the bread is buttery and crunchy on the edges, the cornbeef is out of this world. If it wasn't for this awesome sandwich, and probably their other great food I'd say this place was a 2 or 3 stars but maybe that just tells you how good it was.

Ok we order pay and sit and wait. We were on a Thursday late afternoon and the place was empty except one other guest.   My Matzo ball soup arrived first. It was heavenly and just hit the spot. I had a Dr. Brown's soda with it and it came in a glass bottle that was a first usually it is always in a can. Than I got a ginormous Black and White cookie for later.

    "text": "Came here for breakfast because the line at Pantry was too long.    Price - I expected to pay a lot, but I had a mushroom omelette, side of bacon, and a coffee; $29, before tip.  That's ridiculous.  There was nothing special about the breakfast.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything I'd come back for.  Food service was quick.  Waitress was sort of attentive.  Coffee was not refilled without asking.  Only two creamers on the table, no more offered, none replaced with refill.  The restaurant was maybe 1/3 full but I found myself getting up to find creamers, sugar and hot sauce from other tables.  Bacon was thin and greasy. Nothing special.  I was hoping for thick cut flavorful bacon.  So, the message is, if you need breakfast you can get it here and the service is pretty quick.  It's obscenely overpriced and isn't anything to write home about, but it's eggs and coffee and sometimes that's all that matters.",

Poor new yorkers are getting screwed....lol  I have to say though the waitress was great but the way this place is set up you pay at the counter you get a number then the waitress brings it and refills drinks etc.... if you dont have cash there is no way to tip these hard working ladies.",

I ordered the chicken soup with rice which hit the spot perfectly and tasted home made.  I accompanied my soup with a potato pancake, absolutely delicious and left me wanting more.

A bit expensive, but not outside of the typical Vegas up charges.  I can not speak on how their normal food tastes, but i can certainly speak to how it looked. AMAZING!

I ordered the Ruben and my wife ordered the club sandwich we shared an order of fries and got 2 soft drinks.  The bill came out to $58.00 usd.  Yes that's right $58.00.  I was a bit thrown off on how expensive it was for sandwiches.  When the sandwiches were served the thought of what I just paid vanished from my mind.  The sandwiches were incredible.  HUGE, TASTY and did I mention HUGEEEE.  LOL.  If your are in Vegas and love deli sandwiches and don't mind breaking the bank a weee bit then this is where you need to be.

Unfortunately my eggs were overcooked- I ordered them overeasy (with dreams of swirling the yolk through the meat.. you know what I'm sayin! ) and they were basically cooked all the way through- which could be a product of the fact that the dish was in a closed container for a few minutes before I ate it. Maybe they could recommend customers \"break\" open the yolk immediately if that want that ooey gooey goodness!",

Pass on that even if they are free! I had 3 poached eggs, ham steak and toast. They give you ONE piece of bread. Wow. For $13, I would love to have the standard 2 pieces of toast. A good $7 breakfast at twice the price. Girls had the Rueben, it was good - but again an awkward little ball of meat and bread.  Not spectacular.",

I should've eaten at the restaurant rather than taking it to my room at Caesars. By the time I got back, my sandwich had become a hot mess.  I had the Woody Allen, half pastrami, half corned beef. The meats were ok, but it was nothing out of this world. I had been expecting a plethora of juicy and cured flavors, especially since I'm a big pastrami enthusiast. The experience wasn't really helped by the really high prices. The service was ok, mostly because I think the manager was present and the workers wanted to look like they were busy. All in all, I would probably give this place one last shot the next time I'm in town, because I think it has potential. I'll make sure to dine-in instead.   PS Dear lady who cut in line in front of me, You're lucky I'm a well-mannered guy and that I don't like to cause a stir. But I sincerely hope you lost all of your life savings and social security money at the slots!",

They were also a mini Carnegie Deli with the Cheesecake delivered from Carnegie Deli, New York. I found out while playing poker this trip to Las Vegas that Carnegie Deli in the Mirage Hotel and Casino existed and immediately had to try it and specifically the cheesecake.  We had the pastrami reuben to share and got a piece of our own cheesecake and we were not disappointed.  My love has returned to Las Vegas.  The food was amazing and the cheesecake exactly the same and just as wonderful as I remembered.  They only have a limited menu compared to the Carnegie Deli in New York, but it has enough choices for just about anyone who loves a good deli.",

    "text": "Carnegie Deli was recommended by a few people to try while I was in New York.  Unfortunately, my schedule was packed and I couldn't make it.  Since we found out there was a Carnegie located in the Mirage Hotel, it was a perfect time to give their famous hot pastrami sandwich a try.  The chicken noodle soup ($6.99) and the chicken soup with matzo balls ($7.99) are a must order!  The noodles were small and tender.  Both soups come with a chicken soup which is flavorful and extremely comforting.  Definitely perfect for the morning after a long Vegas night.  The hot pastrami sandwich ($16.99) was a disappointment.  A large amount of pastrami is stacked between two pieces of bread (choice of rye, white, or pumpernickel) and served with a side of pickles and dijon mustard.  Though I ordered a HOT pastrami sandwich, it came out room temperature and the meat was dry.  I thought maybe I just got a dud, but my friends said the same thing after eating there a day later.   WHAT TO KNOW: *Dine in or take out (note: they're separate entrances) *Consider sharing, portions are HUGE *Breakfast served all day *Not sure on their exact hours. Their napkins say 7am-2am, but they were open around 4:30am",

YES :D  There is no way I could eat a whole one...   I did have a few Yelp friends who had been here prior (Michael C, Clarence A, and Cherie T), so that was great to read their reviews/pictures first, I bookmarked it, and I am happy to say it was on my \"top 10 To Eat\" list in Vegas, luckily I was also staying at the Mirage which made it more convenient for me as well.  On my visit, I did look over the menu, but I still wanted the Pastrami, so I picked the half sandwich and soup combo for lunch.   Let me just say, I have never had Matzo ball soup in my life and it was soooooooo DELICIOUS,  I loved the broth!!!  I am very happy I ordered that because it complimented the sandwich perfectly.  I am a Pastrami lover, meat lover, and I thought the sandwich was great, simple, flavorful.  Rye bread, lots and lots of Pastrami, then I added on deli mustard.  My lunch also came with 2 pickles and an Iced tea for a total of $13.75.  That was such a great price!!!  You order at the register, they give you a #, go sit at any table, and your server will bring you your food/drink. I was very full and satisfied, my server was friendly, would love to come back again to Carnegie's deli :)   Had a great experience!  Next time, I'll get the Corned beef sandwich with Matzo ball soup ;)",

The blt I had was actually quite normal sized, the turkey club was enormous.   But my problem was that the meat and bacon were both very bland and flavorless. For $60, I would expect the flavor to be good. I never in my life imagined spending that much on sandwiches and fries, but was willing to do so for the \"famous Carnegie Deli.\" I could have spent that money on a quality dinner and not a deli sandwich.  I had to slather the sandwiches with mayo and mustard, which I generally don't like, in order to give some taste. The bacon didn't even taste cured, which I can't explain because I'm sure it was...   If it was large AND flavorful this would be a 5 star review for sure. Quality over quantity. For that cost, get better meat. :-/  Read my entire review before picking out one small note in it and acting like it was a preference thing. It wasn't.",

Come here for one thing - the sandwiches. They are HUGE and the best real deli corned beef and Pastrami around. In this case it's even a case of the location surpassing the original in NYC.   Would be 5 starts except the service can be spotty, especially late night.",

The prices aren't that bad.  Also, our service was really great. But what really made our experience fun was just the people around us. It was a hilarious atmosphere after everyone got those gargantuan sandwiches and just looked at them, boggled.",

There were maybe two things on the menu that didn't have meat and when the food came out, I was very glad I ordered the grilled vegetables (not that they tasted that great, but they didn't make my stomach explode.) The meat dishes were ridiculous, four to five servings on one sandwich.   The food was not very tasty, insanely expensive and extremely wasteful, as only two out of eight of our party could finish their food (and one of them wound up with a tummy ache.)  Now, if you enjoy eating until you sweat and lose the ability to move, this is the place for you, but it would be cheaper and yummier to just go to the In-and-Out.",

It seemed like the quality wasn't as lean as what we usually get. We thought maybe we had a bad batch and would give them a try next time we were in Vegas. This year we went with the corned beef again and it was excellent. The beef was very lean and the portion size is huge. There's enough for two people to easily share this sandwich. We definitely will stop in the next time we are in town.",

Also, this sandwich is REALLY BIG.  TREMENDOUSLY BIG.    I wouldn't call it a complaint, but I have been fortunate enough to eat at the original Carnegie Deli in NYC... and this location lacks the same vibe and ambiance of that location.  And I would have done whatever was necessary to include this in the New York New York hotel instead of the Mirage (duh!).

There's really no way I can eat a single sandwich piled with over two pounds of pastrami and corned beef, and for $22 (plus an extra $3 if you split it) it's expensive and it's not like you're going to carry around a doggy bag all day. I'd gladly pay half the price for half the food.  The BLT and the french fries were awesome. The BLT was stacked high with bacon, probably a whole pounds worth, with fresh tomatoes and crisp lettuce. It was a mess to eat, but very good. The dijon / mayo sauce they serve with the sandwich was also great and I wish I brought some home. Fries were exceptional - they were double fried so crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Definitely a pleasant surprise to get such good french fries.  The brisket sandwich was just okay. I don't think I'd get it again. It just wasn't anything special compared to the other sandwiches I ate. Service was good, and fast. They serve kosher pickles with your order and they were great.  Sadly I did not get to try any of their desserts, which again were expensive but looked great. Next time!",

Over the years-  as noted by other reviewers-  I have noticed cost cutting measures that are now hurting this restaurant.  Unfortunately - the quality of the food has declined.  I visited twice this weekend.  The first visit I had corned beef and the second visit I had the pastrami.  In both cases the quality of the meat was below average and just dull.  Both times I also had the matzo ball soup.  The second time the soup fell short.  Overall I was not satisfied with the food and I felt a little sick after one meal.  For the money I now think there are better choices.  I hope the Mirage takes note and turns this place around.  It used to be a great place.  Also - bring back the bowl of pickles.",

This was my best dining experience in the Mirage, and in Vegas overall, a deli sandwich piled high w/ corned beef and pastrami, with spicy mustard and 2 pickles.  Yeah, that simple.  First time I've ever had a sandwich where I needed more bread.  I got it to go, and while I waited I was staring at their awesome display of decadent desserts.  Oh geez, thank God I didn't have more time here, the pies and offerings looked so fabulous.   It's massive, it's tasty, it was authentic, and it was nothing less than spectacular.  You'd be selling yourself short if you didn't stop by here.  I spent a summer in NYC a while ago and this definitely brought me back.  So nostalgic.  My co-worker grew up on Queens Blvd, and he was smiling ear-to-ear after his Woody Allen experience.  And here I thought he won at the Craps table, but no, it's due to a sandwich.   It's 24/7 here too, what a bonus, now what more do you need?  Oh sure, a young hot waitress spreading on the spicy mustard on for ya.  Awww yeah.",

If he didn't feel like working at that moment, he should've gone a break and not take it out on customers. Food was good, except the terrible service left a bad taste in my mouth. Ordered the Woody Allen (pastrami and corned beef), which was good. Don't expect a fancy sandwich with condiments. It's just purely meat and VERY thin slices of bread. Get some extra horse radish and enjoy the sandwich with their pickles. Hope you don't get the rude cashier!!",

Through my amazing power of persuasion (bullying, perhaps) I manage to convince my travel companion to order the other.  SO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD.  Cheesecake heaven.  Seriously.

Hands down the best Deli in Las Vegas, and one of the best in the Western United States.  The Reuben here is legendary. Understated on the menu, but good luck on finishing it'! Do yourself a favor--  don't delve into researching it too much, Carnegie's take on the Reuben is exaggerated, excessive, extra ordinary, over blown, and over executed, it's a masterpiece. Let it be a surprise.   My gripe would be the turkey they serve here. It's above average, but it pales in comparison to the outstanding corned beef and pastram, which is as superior as any in the country.   The diner style dishes are prepared fresh, things like Meat Loaf, fried chicken, open faced burgers are superb.   Breakfast is excellent, and reminiscent of what you'd find at any great Manhattan deli.  All the bread is fresh baked on the premises, and the service is quick.***brutally busy at times, sometimes it's smart to show a little green to the hostess.   At the Mirage near the Sports Book Free Parking Recommended  20$ a person is the average check. NOT A DISCOUNT SANDWICH DESTINATION  MASSIVE portions that are boxed easily, if you're a guest at the Mirage, take that sammy back and shove it in the fridge.  Kids will like dining so close to the slots and sports book. Their parents might not.",

They have a take-out service on the side of the deli that showcases the desserts. The worst thing about this convenience? Picking which one to take with you.  The price seems a little high - $9 to $10 a piece, but the height of the pie or cake and the size of the slice make it we'll worth the price. Like the sandwiches, the deli prides themselves on the huge portion size.",

It is True, smack in the center of the casino across from the Beatles Cirque  theatre sits this spacious spot looking pretty similar, with fast friendly service and an exact menu from the New York original. The selection ranges from all day greasy breakfast to a selection of gigantic open faced sandwiches and some entrees. I opted to order the Rueben which when it was delivered took up the entire plate and was huge! Loaded with cheese and about at least a pound and a half of Corned beef and sauerkraut laying on a large rye slab of bread, this was unreal. It was so large, I could only finish half and it was delicious! Wash it down with a beer and a pickle and it hit the spot with fast enough service and a nice price to hit the show within 45 minutes of being seated this place was a winner!",

Everything is really at least two portions, sometimes three or four. If you're wise, when you're with another person, you'll order a single dish. You two can split it and probably still have leftovers (if you're in a room with a fridge). The prices are high, but when you realize that each dish is at least two full meals, it seems reasonable.  I had the tongue omelet. It was monstrous. Two omelets in one. Could not finish it even though it was delish. My gf had the BLT. This was probably four sandwiches in one. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it contained an entire pound of bacon. She didn't even come close to finishing it although she liked it.  Our server was super friendly while also moving nonstop and multitasking her a-- off. A man who looked a little like Humphrey Bogart was also speeding around. They contributed to the authentic NYC deli atmosphere, which was broken only by the blinking, chirping gambling devices just beyond the railing.",
