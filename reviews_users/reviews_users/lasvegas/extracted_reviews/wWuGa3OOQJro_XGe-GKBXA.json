    "text": "I'm so jealous that Vegas gets such a good sushi place that even sushi restaurants in LA and OC cannot compare to, except maybe Urwasawa, but then a meal there cost a car payment ($400 pp).  Another excuse to come to Vegas!!!  Staff (5/5) Friendly attentive. Sushi chiefs were friendly, informative and take great pride in their art.  Decor/atmosphere (5/5) No nonsense simple comfy modern interior. Great looking sushi prep table.  Food (5/5) Avoid omakase though for True sushi lovers. Highly recommend anything that ends with a toro. Great homemade soysauce seasoning and perfectly cooked rice, resulting in one of the best sushi restaurants in LV and SoCal.",

    "text": "YAY. I wanted to go back to Las Vegas to visit THIS RESTAURANT. Firstly the interior of the restaurant is so cute. They have such pretty dinnerware and the wooden interior makes this place seem nice and calming-perfect for sushi. Everything looked so clean and well organized as well.   Both my boyfriend and I went for the nigiri course because we really just wanted to eat sushi. After the nigiri course, we went ahead and added few more pieces of sushi. The sushi was prepared to perfection. OH AND THE EGG! My boyfriend usually doesn't like the sweet egg omelette and often gives me his egg as well. He actually ordered another one for himself because it was that good. I love how the egg was served warm instead of cold. It was so soft and had the perfect amount of sweet in it.   I've been to Kusakabe in San Francisco before, and I prefer this place much more than Kusakabe. Price is so reasonable. If you like sushi and ever come to Las Vegas really visit this place because it is a hidden gem in a desert!  We ordered Nambubijin Sake to enjoy with our sushi and the sake was good too.",

    "text": "There are many reasons Kabuto may not be for you, but reasons it may be? Perhaps you lived or visited Japan and have been to sushi-yas all over North America searching for that one special place to replicate it.   A place not only offering quality fish, but also caring service on the standard you are accustomed to in Japanese restaurants, fresh, seasonal ingredients prepared in a thoughtful manner, excellent rice selection and knowledgable staff. Kabuto has this in spades.   This restaurant is exquisite, and so good my partner and I made a reservation to eat there again during a recent Vegas trip before we had even finished our first meal there. We cancelled a third visit to Guy Savoy to eat here again. It really is that good. (Although in a completely different class than G.S., to be fair)   Like many other Yelpers, would recommend the nigiri course and then ordering by the piece until you are sated. We got the yoroi course the first time, and although it is good and showcases many things the kitchen does well, I felt I wanted more focus on nigiri sushi and we opted for more piece by piece ordering on our second visit. There is enough variety on their daily fish menu to please the most well versed sushi aficionado ... or even the most novice. Saw a few fish on the two visits that were new to me, but also many classics.   The fish is immaculate and varied, as mentioned. But the rice - God, the rice. Fluffy, a little warm, just a little sweet sour with seasoning, this is perfect shari. Any place that cares about fish will care even more about the rice, and they do at Kabuto. Feel free to ask about the fish, though - they will tell you down to the island where it was caught if you are curious.   And without getting political, for the health of our oceans, I would recommend you steer away from bluefin. Yes, it's delicious, and yes Kabuto offers it, but it's also horribly overfished and there are many other fish that are not as over harvested and just as, if not more delicious. Go out on a limb a bit, and give bluefin tuna a break!",

    "text": "I would just like to start off by saying that this is the best sushi that I have ever had in my life.... and this may stay True, until I visit Japan.   This place isn't the type to show off fancy rolls with intricate ingredients that enhance the flavor of subpar fish... it's a traditional type of sushi (mainly nigiri and sashimi) which put emphasis on the quality of the fish (many cuts imported from Japan)  Both times that I've come here, I've had their omakase ( I believe there are two kinds, but I got the one that was 120/pp) and both times it has been ridiculously good. It may sound a bit pricey for most people, but I feel that the experience was so good and the fish was so fresh that the price was totally worth it. I mean since you're in Vegas, you'll end up losing that money on the tables anyways -_-... so you might as well invest in  your stomach and enjoy this meal!  But the next time I'm in Vegas, I'll def hit up Kabuto again  but you can see my courses at kabuto here and see deliciousness for yourself <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fdphan913%2F&s=6cad32ef8e314db3d42d352989c1ab230d5a0d329aed0f91bcf4e92ed86ac80b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instagram.com/dphan913</a>",

And add the shrimp head miso soup.....it's fantastic!  This evening, the chu toro and, to my surprise, the sea bass were phenomenal! I've never been disappointed with the mackerel which can sometimes be fishy but here has never been anything less than exceptional.  The staff is knowledgable and so very sweet. No matter what sake you choose, it will pair well with whatever comes out.  My only disappointment (not really a big deal at all) is that the chopsticks are the pull apart kind. Splinters. But it did not hinder my overall experience.   All in all, a truly amazing and intimate affair!!",

This place is outstanding! I felt overjoyed with every bite, on occasion I was depressed when the bite was over. This happened with both a piece of fish called  triangle and a piece of Kobe beef. The service was impeccable and the chefs are SPECTACULAR!  I went with the mid level omakase which was nice because I then ordered a few more pieces to try at the end but next time I'll go with the top option at $120.  I will be dreaming about it until next time....",

    "text": "This is the best sushi place in Las Vegas. Firm.  Surely enough, this place is not for those who like California rolls. They don't serve these westernized rolls. Pretty traditional.   Don't get fooled by their 'presentation' because it's for people who watched the movie on Jiro (btw, Sukiyabashi Jiro is NOT the best in Japan. Fuck no).   Sushi here is decent and fresh. Chefs are honest and knowledgeable - They will tell you where the fish is coming from.   They often have Kawahagi, file fish that belongs to Tetraodontiformes, that is, blow fish. However, Kawahagi has nothing to do with infamous poisonous Fugu (blow fish). So, don't worry about getting poisoned to death. Kawahagi doesn't taste like Fugu at all. Don't get fooled when sushi chef says it is a blow fish because it isn't. (I had fugu in Tokyo several times. Great stuff, btw).   $7 for fatty tuna is a steal. They are pretty good,,, and actually cheaper than Japan. I remembered I paid like $40 for a piece of fatty tuna in Ginza district Tokyo. It was great. But fatty tuna here is pretty good for the price (Sushi place in Narita airport in Tokyo even charges like 10 or 15 for a piece of fatty tuna or salmon roe).  Medium fatty tuna (chu-toro) is better.   Akami is really great. Zuke is even better.   Salmon roe is GREAT. After eating the real salmon roe here, you can't go back to all-you-can-eat place or izakaya style bar because then you feel like you are eating fishing baits.  Well, everything is good here. If you don't know much about traditional sushi, they have a course menu that is only $80. So, no worry.   Tamago was only negative that I had. Not perfect. I've had a better tamago. Maybe it's not their fault. It's just hard to find good eggs here in Vegas.   And one more thing - yes, portion (of the rice, sumeshi)  is really small. It's so small that you may feel like you are eating sashimi, not sushi. I wish they put, like 20%, more.   Dessert was pretty OK. Japanese style - not too sugary.   Service is good.   I do not compare this place to any sushi bars in Japan. It is not fair. But I still think this place is pretty good. JUST GO TO THIS PLACE!",

Now coming here a second time was a different experience since it was a party of 4 at a table rather than 2 in front of a sushi master. However,  still a highly pleasurable experience.  I think this place is specially made for couples that can sit in front of their own sushi master.    There is nothing like this place in the desert, or on the strip (thankfully not).  We are so lucky to have this unadulterated sushi in the desert.  No question, Kabuto is the place.  So simple you may question why pay so much?  From the attentive service to the detail in presentation, more importantly the fresh fish; there is no sushi experience like it.  Frankly the omakase is a steal. Look at the various menus yelpers post...have you been able to be so specific on the type of species of fish/seafood you are eating?  With this day and age of mislabeling of fish, dining at Kabuto, you can be assured you are getting  real authentic sushi.  A learning lesson for me, make your reservations early in the evening...once the fish is finished it is 86ed from the menu; by the end of our meal which started at 8:00 pm (the restaurant only opens at 6 pm)  there was only 4 fishes to choose from.  Not disappointed, you know it is fresh and also selective, when it is gone 1/2 way through dinner service, you know it is good and fresh.  I truly feel privileged to eat here.  My guests from NYC were equally impressed.  Furthermore, one of my guest had a shellfish allergy and they ensure all his sushi remained \"pure\".  He left completely unscathed and raving about the sushi.    Go! Especially for a special occasion...promotion, birthday, or anniversary.  Kabuto will only accentuate the celebration.   See the menu selection from our special dinner and also a beautiful plate from our dinner, here: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kabuto-las-vegas?select=7T1GkjCjZS4nAgL-7XEOPA#7T1GkjCjZS4nAgL-7XEOPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kabu...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kabuto-las-vegas?select=7T1GkjCjZS4nAgL-7XEOPA#TwSnDNsRoxdOAToNivbHkg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kabu...</a>  I am forever indebted to Kabuto for introducing me to fresh uni...my new foie gras from the sea!",

Here is a sneak peak before I write about it in a month or two.  Omakase starts at $48 for high quality fish, which is a rarity in Las Vegas.   NIGIRI  aperitif sake / amuse / nigiri (10pc) / hand roll / dessert  The service and technique could use some refinement - I had a piece of cloth in my rice with ikura and a bone in one of my fish which is not acceptable. My main gripe would be how they dealt with it. They chose not to use their words to announce their sincerity. Will revisit before I decide how to write about them in my update. In the meantime, please enjoy these beautiful pictures.   This place is still worth a visit for quality and value.

    "text": "Honestly. The BEST sushi I've ever had in my entire 24 years of existence.   If anyone has ever seen \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" on Netflix, this sushi restaurant embodies the spirit of the way authentic Japanese sushi is served and how it is presented to customers.  Yes, this place is on the more pricey side. But it is worth every. single. penny. Depending on which course you choose, appetizers and fish come out in different arrays of styles and in different orders. You are given a very light, but tasty house sake to cleanse your palette in between trying different fish. The customer service is very attentive and staff are ALWAYS cleaning up dirty plates and ALWAYS asking if you're doing well during your stay.  The best part of the entire meal is getting to choose your own choices of fish near the end of the course. ALL OF THE FATTY TUNAS ARE TO DIE FOR! Seriously. Heaven.",

    "text": "I rarely give five star restaurant reviews, but Kabuto has earned this wholeheartedly. This is an authentic omakase experience and worth starving yourself for and doing a few extra miles.   They have two seatings nightly, reservations required, and they won't start service until your whole party is present. They will, of course ask if you have any food allergies.   They start you off with a palate cleanser 2% sake. It's definitely not at all what you're thinking it might be. It has a mellow plum flavor and is served on ice. It's a great way to start the meal.   I was thrilled with the diversity of the fish we were served. It was a visual feast as well as a cornucopia of flavors. There were things I had never heard of, and some very familiar things.   This is a very intimate spot. Best enjoyed with close friends or as a date night spot. This is definitely not a party people disco joint.   I'm looking forward to to a return trip to this sweet spot!",

    "text": "Absolutely phenomenal. I got emotional while eating here lol.  Clean, incredibly fresh food with a m a z i n g service from everyone we came in contact with, from the soft-spoken and demure waitress to the cheeky young itamae (who recommended his favorite wakaremi--from the dorsal fin of the bluefin tuna--to complete our course before miso soup and dessert to finish).   We got the Yoroi omakase option, although it was slightly hard to forgo the highest Kabuto option, as we went in knowing we wanted to order individual items off the \"a la carte\" nigiri menu. We wanted to focus on having raw fish as opposed to the other grill items, tempura, etc. Accompanying our meal was a sake we chose--described as \"soft, lightly sweet\"--but its strong taste wasn't my cup of tea. The sake-mixed drink they present to you in a shot glass of sorts is amazing, though. Wish we could've gotten a whole pitcher of that.  We ate too many single items for me to go into detail here, but I recommend Kabuto with ALL of my heart. Only wish there was something similar to this in Chicago!  Be sure to make a reservation! You can call 3pm onwards, and ask for a seat at the sushi bar. This restaurant is so nondescript and located in an area away from The Strip--so underrated, and just how I like it.",

    "text": "THE BEST SUSHI PLACE IN LAS VEGAS!   I heard about this place from one of our friend.  He said it's the best sushi place in town.  I came on Yelp and realized I bookmarked it a while back.  Can't believe we didn't try it way before.  The only hard part is to make reservation.  Their hours to call is 2 hours a day, they don't have call waiting.  The phone line is usually busy tone.  They don't take calls on their closing day, return calls, or take reservation via email or voicemail.  As you can see, I called them a lot for our reservation.  Another problem is, making sure if everyone is going to be there ahead of time.  You have to put down a credit card for reservation for 7 people and already pick out what menu we want to have.  It was worth the hassle for my husband's birthday gather.  I was sure or at least hoping everyone will show up.  =)   We came about 15-20 minutes early because of the parking situation.  We were lucky we found a spot right away.  I have to say, no wonder why the reservation is a little bit difficult.  They only have about 20 seatings in this restaurant.  It seems very zen in here.  All the servers speak to you in a very low gentle voice.  Our server was wonderful.  She has the same birthday as my husband, that day we went.  Such a great, sweet girl coming to work on her birthday.    We did the $80 Yoroi Menu.  Every bite melts in your mouth.  Nothing more to say but can't wait to come back on our date night.",

But what truly blew us away was the quality of the fish. We ordered the omakase and were told by our chef that each of the fish come directly from Japan, Seattle, or Europe that day and the fish were literally swimming less than 24hours ago. Wow! The toro, snapper, and yellowtail were the freshest I have ever had. There are only 2 servings each night so reservations are a must. I will definitely be back to Kabuto the next time I come to Vegas and I give them one of my highest recommendations!",

    "text": "Simply exquisite. Wonderful food. Fantastic, friendly service.  Worth every penny. Truly \"As good as it gets\".  This is a place for people who already love sushi - the art, the craft, the fish. Don't come here to 'try it'. This is a place for the sushi cognoscenti. They don't serve anything else.  Also don't come here expecting rolls, deep-fried shrimp, heavy sauces, or naughty names. There is none of that. Just fish, prepared beautifully.  I can eat a lot of sushi, but the Kabuto Omakase was almost more than I could handle.  Every bite was Heaven.  I was particularly happy about the O-Toro, which is perhaps the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. And as someone who has never liked sea urchin, I was surprised to find that the Japanese sea urchin was absolutely fantastic! I actually ordered extra.  It isn't cheap. Dinner for two, including tip, was about $360. You could do it cheaper - ordering a la carte or one of the less-expensive omakase experiences. But I strongly recommend shelling out for the full Kabuto experience. Save up. You'll be glad you did.  Hint:  Both my date and I much preferred the plain miso soup to the soup with fish.  N.B.  Make reservations and follow their instructions for the follow-up call/text on the day of your dinner. Otherwise, you may be turned away at the door.",

    "text": "After how many years, i finally got to try this myself. Came here with my best friend on Valentines Day and two others to enjoy a special night, with some DELICIOUS, MOUTH WATERING, and teasing... food :D   Reservations required. 2 seatings per night. Our reservation was at 6pm ON valentines day (02/14/2015). I had arrived early. Doors opened at about 5:55 or so to let guests who were waiting outside in to take a seat.   Upon seating with one of our friends, who arrived earlier than us. We were given a menu. The menu presents the omakase selections - Nigiri ($48), Yoroi ($80), and Kabuto ($120), the a la carte selections - appetizer ($8) , sashimi ($24), miso soup ($4), seasonal dessert ($4-7), and a wide selection of sake, wine, beer, and other drinks.   Aside from this menu, there is also a menu of the day's fishes available to order a la carte (some of the fishes are picked from this menu for the omakase). Fishes range from blue fin tuna from Spain to fishes you may have never heard of before.   I was recommended to choose the cheapest omakase selection (Nigiri for $48) and add by a la carte later for any want to try, so that is what i did.   This is not your usual japanese restaurant. Each thing is served as you eat. One after another. Not all given on one plate. Pace yourself. Enjoy it. Savor it. Dont feel rushed.   Aperitif - shot size of their homemade sake aged for approx 10 months with about 2% alcohol.  Sweet. Smooth. Flavorful. Delicious.   Amuse (bite-sized hors d'uvre)- Monk fish liver with ponzu sauce topped with a spicy radish and a side of pickled cucumbers and seaweed. -   Clean flavor from the liver with a nice kick from the radish and pickled veggies.   Nigiri (10 pc) - Hobo (Gunard), Hira-aji (Coastal Trevally), Akami (Blue Fin Tuna), Kan-sawara (winter butterfish), Umimasu (Ocean Trout), Chu-Toro (Medium Fatty Tuna), Homemade Ikura with rice, Chopped Toro with rice, Kogane Anago (Golden Sea Eel), Gyoku (Sweet Omelette)  Chu-toro was amazing. Insta-mouth orgasm. Not too fatty like o-toro but not too lean like akami.   Homemade Ikura is amazing. Perfectly seasoned and super fresh. You do not see a single egg thats \"deflated\". Amazing combination with their sushi rice. I could eat a huge bowl of ikura and the rice daily. The sushi rice is cooked perfectly, and the temperature that is almost perfect to not room temp, but how it should be. Body temperature.   Kogane Anago was perfectly cooked with a good amount of their secret unagi sauce. Not overly sweet. Not overpowering the natural sweetness of the eel. You don't find saltwater eel (anago) as you usually do the freshwater (unagi).  Gyoku. homemade sweet egg branded with their own logo. Not too firm. Sweet. Thick. Flavor reminded me of a chinese steamed egg dessert i used to eat as a kid.   Hand Roll - Premium fatty tuna hand roll with chopped onions served with a dipping soy sauce  First time ive seen a hand roll made this way but from now on, im totally copying their style at home. They roll it horizontally into a roll and close with a strip of nori vs rolling it into a cone. Smart. Unique. Chopped fatty tuna mixed with chopped onions. Onions adds a nice texture to the chopped fatty tuna that was soft and tender. The dipping soy sauce complimented it all nicely. Not overly salty, almost sweet.   A la carte nigiri - Isaki (Striped Pig), Mizutako (Giant Octopus), Kanburi (King Yellowtail), Botan-ebi (Live Sweet Shrimp), Kohada (Shad), Ezo-bafun Uni (Japanese Sea Urchin), Uni (Sea Urchin)  Most of these were amazing in itself. I'm glad i ordered these to try.   Isaki had a good texture and sweet.   Mizutako was not chewy. Quite tender  Kanburi was amazing. Almost another insta-mouth orgasm like the chu-toro.   Botan-ebi was fresh. Meat was \"crisp\".   Kohada was prepared well. Nicely seasoned and prepared due to the tiny bones it has. Not too vinegar-y.   Uni (from Catalina Island i heard) was AMAZING. I turned and told my best friend \"i feel like im eating ocean butter...\" she just laughed. mmm ^_^   Ezo-bafun uni... AMAZING. flashback reminder to my japan trip in 2006. Sweet. Fresh. Simply Amazing.   Dessert - Strawberry Mille Crepe Cake  Served with hot green tea. Perfect combination and end to the meal. Not overly creamy or sweet. Green tea was fresh and hot.   All this costed approx. $100 and some change before tips. This is not a meal to be over stuffed, but is a meal to indulge in the finest of cuisine and to experience the almost absolute tradition of how sushi is supposed to be served and eaten.   Service is superb, if not a little too much XD the reason why i say this is because i felt like i had someone standing behind me at all times ... waiting for something to be finished and taken away... lol ! but great attention and super nice ! The chef's were nice as well. They probably know they have a slight accent so they were nice to repeat any of the names i couldn't hear clearly when they served the nigiri.   HIGHLY recommended",

All Japanese servers are professional & knowledgable, step by step!    ~How~ Sushi Rice: It was very smooth, perfectly cooked, perfect size, fluffy but gather together, it was not all compressed hard together, size of rice & how it gather together fit perfectly to the fish on top, that's called \"deep chef's professional nigiri skills.

Deep Chefs:  -Don't need to speak too much but usually say: \"hi/hello, how are u, what's your likes/dislikes on types of fish, thank you, goodbye, all they care about is the result of what customers respond/react to the dishes which \"chef's taste controls customers\"     They've got 3 class level of \"omakase\":  I chose the highest omakase - $120 (8 courses)  my friend followed the same:   ~Why~  Cuz the lower omakase you won't get the best parts & highest grades of fish or extra stuff...like grilled platter and something else.   ~What~ Aperitif Sake  (A) started off w/ fetish style ~chilled peachy light sake~ make you feel fetish.....

It was a Friday Night and we called at 7:00pm thinking there was no chance for reservations in this small 20 person place, however they had two open spots left and we are very glad they did!!",

    "text": "I'm glad I came. This was my first time eating edome style sushi so bare in mind that I'm basing this on my experience as a whole, not necessarily on how traditional the execution was. We made reservations a couple weeks in advance, but they only had availability at 8pm. Our seat was right at the bar so we were able to watch the magic happen. Fresh fish wrapped and unwrapped, sliced and arranged. One person was in charge of preparing the cuts of protein and rice while another plated. I even got to watch one make wasabi by hand. Service was most excellent!  The food needs no introduction but note that you don't necessarily need to order off the omakase tasting menu. If you ask for the a la cart menu upon arrival, you can order souly off that. As this was our first time, we went with the Omakase course and ordered a couple al la cart. The meal took quite a while to complete since there were only 3 people working to feed a restaurant full of patrons. The boo and I loved the sake so much! We made sure to make it last half way through our meal.  Patience is a virtue.  -Despite reading friend's reviews, my husband and I still got a little lost. We made it to the correct shopping center but I mistakenly opened the door of another business. Feeling like an idiot we continued on and found the high rectangular windows which are pictured on their website.",

    "text": "It was my second time attempting to try Kabuto out. I am a huge fan of omakase sushi and Kabuto has the reputation to be the best in Las Vegas.  I arrived here with my boss and an important customer and I must I was not dissapointed.   Sushi: 4/5 Excellent variety (worldwide) and super fresh. Rice had a nice consistency and the temperature was just right. Size of fish was on the small side. Besides that, I was very satisfied. The set we ordered was on the cheaper side, so in combination with the sushi sizes, I was still hungry. They then offered an a la carte menu that gave us the choice of how we wanted to end off our dinner. As a regular omakase patron, I knew which pieces I would order. However I can see how ones who are not versed in fish selection could compromise their dining experience at this point.   Service: 5/5 We received a detailed summary of the source of the fish that was being served and as well as the way it was prepared before it was served. Everything from each piece of sushi to the creative appetizers and drinks was accompanied with a nice verbal presentation.   I would give Kabuto a 4.5 if possible.   When I return to LV, and feel like a nice omakase dinner, I will definitely return to Kabuto.  Great job!",

    "text": "Kabuto is located in the heart of Chinatown, a cozy 24-seat Omakase Sushi Bar offering traditional Edomae style sushi, est. '12. Zen decore, pristine, and brilliant. Ambiance is warm and inviting. There's a coat rack in the back beside an ornate tea set display. Place is super clean, observing workstations being meticulously tidied, and the restroom is just dandy.  Beer and Wine List is OK. Fairly impressive sake choices to enhance your Omakase experience. Good food and good sake is pure ambrosia. Fresh, quality ingredients, fish and shellfish are first-class, quite capital.  \"Kabuto ()\" Omakase Course, $120 ...Aperitif Sake: Kikumasamune (Kimoto Junmai). ...Appetizer (Ankimo): Fresh, full of livery deliciousness. ...Sashimi (5): Akami, Amaebi, Oyster, Hotate, O-Toro. ...Grilled (5): Akami, Black Cod, Hamachi, Vegetables, Uni? ...Nigiri (12): Akami, Chu-Toro, O-Toro, Hamachi, Shima-aji, Aji, Ikura, Unagi, Tamagoyaki, other two... .. blame it on the alcohol ;) ...Handroll (Akami): Crispy nori is always satisfying. ...Miso Soup: + Amaebi Head; prefer it flash-fried. ...Dessert (Red Bean Ice Cream?):   Nigiri is purr-fectly balanced. O-Toro gently melts on your taste buds, a rich marbled blanket of bliss. Uni from across the globe tastes fresh to death, sweet, buttery and sinfully orgasmic.. hurts so good. Tamagoyaki finale is light, delightfully sweet and satisfying. Will opt for the simple Nigiri () course next rendezvous.  Chef Nobu is a bona fide virtuoso in his craft, superb knife skills. Waitresses are friendly too. Staff seems to somewhat grasp the concept of \"Sense of Urgency\", then again it's a different setting.  Off-strip, but an authentic Japanese Omakase experience worth the quest. If you're ready to chow down this is not the place for you, though their freshness justifies the prices, it does add up... e.g. Single-handedly devoured the Kabuto course plus an array of O-Toro & Uni Nigiri with a yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Amabuki Himawari, hi-ho! -$272.15 Bill + $25.85 Bloody Taxes + -$62 Tip = -$360. Blimey!  Happy New Year Kabuto!",

Surprisingly, they prepare their fish to preserve flavor while supressing the fishness. My wife usually only eat salmon, sweet shrimp, and tamago because other fish is too fishy for her.  However, my wife even had mackerel (which is one of the most fishy flavor sushi) and enjoyed it. In my opinion, that mackerel was most smooth and delicately prepared mackerel I have ever tasted. We ordered the smaller omakaze because they ran out of certain fish for large omakaze as we did visit near the closing time. We have hard time going to sushi restaurant after being spoiled from here. We are coming back here for the next trip to Vegas.",

Sit at the bar for the best omakase experience. It will change your life. The sushi goes from chef to plate to mouth. The plate is just courtesy.  Every piece of sushi we had in our Nigiri omakase was amazing. The set starts with a sake shooter, which is light and refreshing. Then comes 10 pcs of nigiri where the chef prepares each one by one with an explanation of what it is and where it comes from. The most notable were the medium fatty tuna and ikura on rice. There is one handroll, and then you are asked if you would like to add any pieces to try off the menu. If not, a small slice of green tea cake is served. Stellar experience, one I don't even have enough words for so my advice is to just try it for yourself. The only reason one star is being taken off is how visibly upset the chef got while I was taking pictures of the sushi. I had to stop because he was fussing. I know it is culturally rude but hey, it's America and I wanted to share his awesome work. Oh well.",

    "text": "One of the top contenders for edomae style sushi in the west coast. I'm sure you've read from all the other reviews about the experience at Kabuto. This review focuses on the service/value, as the food has been covered thoroughly by other yelpers.  Service: 5 Food: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Reservations: Not required, but in my opinion, a must.  The server/client ratio is extremely high, so the average American might be put off by this level of service and might rate it badly (aka: hovering). Try this place out and see what real service is like. They will stand within 5-6 feet of you at all times, which is excellent. The servers are extremely knowledgeable about their menu. I believe both the chefs and the servers are educated on the daily menu. If you have extreme social anxiety, I would avoid this place like the plague. Otherwise, skip the regular tables and reserve a seat at the sushi bar. There are 10 seats at the sushi bar, the one closest to the entrance is 1 (which is where the head chef Gen-san is stationed).  I usually reserve seats 9-10 and ask for Nobu-san. Nobu -san's attention to detail is on par with Gen-san in my opinion and he is less intimidating.  Most valuable way to eat here is to order the $48 omakase and individually order pieces that you liked/want to try. The yoroi and kabuto dinner is not a good deal for the money. We came here to eat sushi right? Skip the non-sushi items. You'll thank me for it.  THE DAMAGE: My party of two tried everything on the daily menu at least once, tried a couple of things twice (Boston scallops) and had a couple of sapporos each. Bill came out to $290, and we left there $400 poorer, but infinitely happier. A definite must-try next time you're in Las Vegas, especially if you win some money from the tables.",

    "text": "Kabuto is located in a busy strip mall in Chinatown. Yet you wouldn't know once you enter. The standard metal and glass frame construction, ubiquitous to every strip mall is transformed into a zen like space. A lone minimalist, rectangular window allows people to look in but for those inside, you are totally removed. The interior is clean with ample light and a subdued atmosphere. A perfect setting to enjoy the sublime cuisine which you are about to eat.   We chose the \"Kabuto\" menu, which contains eight courses for $120 (aperitif sake / appetizer / sashimi platter (5 kinds) / grill platter (5 varieties) / nigiri (12pc) / hand roll / miso soup / dessert)  The first course was their Sake aperitif which was made in house from two types of mash. I've never liked Sake before. Perhaps it's because the ones I had were swill. The aperitif was chilled to the point of ice crystals forming on the top, melon flavours and a slight sweetness with a silky mouth feel. This is one time where I wish I could have supersized my drink.  After eating over 20 different items a few highlights are:  - The Golden Eye Snapper was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever eaten. Look for it!  - The Spot Prawn from Santa Barbara was excellent. Slightly sweet, served with real wasabi.   - The Aburi Blue Fin 'triangle' was barely seared, just enough to taste the flavour of the torch; ambrosia of the sea.   - Normally I'm not a fan of Ikura or Salmon Roe. Not wanting to offend the chef, I forced a smile and nodded when he handed us two very generous portions of the roe. As I prepared myself for an oily-kind of fishy-unpleasantness I was surprised at how clean and delectable the roe was. No unpleasantness here.   The only thing we were served which I did not like was the Spiny Sea Snail. Being served in its large, spiky shell, it did not look appetizing nor inviting. The flesh was tough and rubbery and the size of a finger. The taste was acrid and charcoal like. The chef mentioned Japanese folks love it for its bitterness. My wife almost threw up and this item effected the rest of her meal. If you see a large, spiky shell, just pass.   Overall the meal went from being very good to sublime. The service was quite attentive and the dishes were well explained. For $120 per person, I expect a top notch experience and that is exactly what Kabuto delivered. If you're looking for an authentic sushi experience Kabuto delivers on the level the best in LA or NYC do.",

    "text": "Vegas' top sushi restaurant.  NOT an AYCE joint.  ZERO Americanized rolls.  PURE Edo style sushi.    Before all my sushi loving yeeps book the trip; meaning no disrespect to the Vegas food scene, Kabuto is the best in Vegas, but does not come close to touching the perfection that is the two Michelin star Urasawa in LA.  Granted, it does not come close to the $500 per person price tag of Urasawa either.  Rambling food history lesson:  This is classic  Edo style sushi born from necessity (no refrigeration in the early 19th century).  Large fillets of fish (toro) wont spoil as fast at room temperature like small fish (saba) with their bacteria filled intestines or turn rancid from their oxidizing fat (ie anago).  Yummy thoughts.  So, big fish = raw, small fish = marinated, oily fish = cooked.  Most are brushed in shoyu  and include wasabi, to inhibit spoilage.  Culinary artistry / craziness has taken over and the humble street food is now served in minimalist zen surroundings,  beautifully sauced and presented the way the chef feels it should be.  Its considered disrespectful for the diner to alter the sushi.  Although you can order individual sushi, the omakase ($80) or nigiri sampler ($48) is the best way to experience the ideal progression of flavors.  Selections change daily depending on availability.  The seafood is sourced globally.  All extremely fresh.  The chu-toro and o-toro correctly graded and a fatty delight.  The giant clam and ama ebi cloyingly sweet with the perfect oceanic finish.  Firm texture.  The list goes on and on.  Very good quality, delicately seasoned, short grain rice.  Nice compaction, holding its form but not breaking the individual grains.    For all its refinement, this is one bite finger food (don't expect pieces of fish so large it slides down your throat and sticks out of your mouth at the same time). Toss the chopsticks aside and dive right in!  Highly recommended.",

Ever since i saw the episode of Anthony Bourdain - No Reservations - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fyuhu4QZJZyw&s=16f5ae66f1591160250cf2fac60955b1bd706980097659a73258886765e75d1d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/yuhu4QZJZyw</a> i knew i had to tried this.    Nothing crazy here.  Just some old fashion, traditional sushi ,and darn good if you ask me.   Bonito, Jack Mackerel, Uni with Ikura, and Cherry Salmon to name a few off the Nigiri Omakase. Finish off with a Tamago that taste like pancake and a Negi-toro hand roll.  Of course the Itamae (skilled chef) will ask if you would like to order anything else ala carte before you get to those. Nigiri Omakase is the way to go.  Just let them know if you have any preference or allergies before hand.  Avoid the tables at all cost.  Even if you have to sacrifice some friends.  Cast them off, tell them lies, do whatever it takes to diminish the group size.  I made a mistake the first time i came around because i joined a party of 4 at the table. Good company ;however, i've missed out on the show.  The last couple time I was fortunate enough to sit at the bar, granted I called 30min prior to closing if they would take in one more resv.   Yea, I'm THAT guy.  Timing is a somewhat crucial. The server informed me that sushi taste different when served from Itamae directly as opposed to table service because of amount of time the fish and rice are exposed to the air temperature.   It's highly recommended that you eat when you are served.  Like straight off the chef's hands if possible.    Calling in for a reservation? How about call in and reserve fresh fishy? Yup, they take special request like that too, but i would imagine you have to be with in the \"in\" crowd to be able to call dibs on those prized catch.  Not to worry though, fishes are flown in daily so there's always going to be something for everyone.  Now that they just got their liquor license, i'm not certain if you can still BYOB.  Servers are quite knowledgeable about their sake. They even suggest champagne with your meal.  Upsale perhaps??  Well then go ahead. Take it!  TAKE MY MONEY!!",

The staffs and chefs speak fluent Japanese, and English with the Japanese accent. So don't believe that review at all.

    "text": "I feel like I've never actually had sushi before. We had the mid-priced omakase with a group of four, and...wow. What an experience.   Everything tasted like the platonic form of the dish, and I felt myself wishing for just one more bite of every single bite. Things l've had before and felt \"meh\" towards, like Ikura and Uni, I feel like I \"got\" what made them special after trying Kabuto's preparation. The uni they served made me finally understand what everyone loves about urchin. It was so intense and flavorful and silky, and just floated over my whole palette. Ikura is usually so salty the only taste I get is the salt and the texture. This Ikura was different; I could taste so many flavors beyond salt.   One dish was two bites of kobe beef rolled around some tiny herbs and onions and...wow. I'm drooling just imagining it, and trying to come up with a good reason why I shouldn't try to go to Kabuto right. now.  Every bite was flawless, and a perfect balance. I've never done omakase, because I usually don't particularly enjoy some textures, like squid and uni, and nori can be a really overwhelming taste for me, so I live in terror of hand rolls.  Yeah I don't know what I was worried about. Kabuto served all of those things, and I felt silly for having any doubts.  I even tried, and loved, milt, though I had to google what part of the fish that was afterwards.   It's just so good. Go. Do it for a surprise special occasion for someone you love a lot. It's a special occasion place, but one you can afford to visit fairly frequently for all that.",

    "text": "I could tell you all the reasons why you shouldn't go here. But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.  Kabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal.   I was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.  Dessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.  To be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi \"joint\" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.",

    "text": "To all the TRUE Sushitarians, This one's for you....FINALLY!!!!! A JAPANESE RESTAURANT THAT SERVES EDOMAE STYLE SUSHI!!!!!!  No, I'm not talking about krab, cream cheese, and yum-yum sauced creations better known as Western Style sushi, but the traditional authentic style sushi you would find in Japan. Thanks yet again to Takashi Segawa, the President/Owner of the Mon Restaurant Group (Sushi Mon on Maryland Parkway,Monta Ramen, and Goyemon), locals and visitors can finally experience Kabuto which has been in the works for the past three years.  I immediately phoned in after finding info through the Yelp App to see if they had any openings, and WHADDAYAKNOW??? There was an opening at 6pm at the bar! Must be my lucky day!?!?!?! I get there promptly at 6pm, and give the waitress my name, and a guy at the bar says \"Nelson?\" \"Yes\", I reply and I assume and guess wrongly that he was Alex S.(Yelp Las Vegas' Authority on Japanese Cuisine) and it was none other than Yelp Las Vegas' resident jokester, Hootie B. So we \"talk story\" a bit in anticipation of our dinner, about the Vegas food scene, and how we were both excited to see the slow transformation of Vegas' \"Japantown\", and to tell you the truth, Hootie's good people.....  The atmosphere and ambiance is somewhat minimalist in a good way...you won't find TV's with the game going on, or top 40 music blasting through the speakers, etc. the staff at Kabuto really pride themselves on tradition here, and that is evident in the beautiful cypress wood countertop/bar without your typical refrigerated showcase, the necessary tools, dishes and ingredients needed to execute such perfection.  Only the best available fish and seafood are served here. Absolutely no frozen fish whatsoever, and Ingredients are delivered direct from the world's best regions. As far as the menu selections go, you may order a la carte, do the Nigiri Tasting ($48) and in the future, a chef's \"Omakase\" ($80). At the time, the Omakase wasn't available since it was a \"Soft Opening\" for friends and family, so I went with the Nigiri Dinner.  I also got one of the best seats in the place, directly in front of the sushi chef which was where all the action took place.  After checking with my server of any possible allergies and sushi preferences, I clean my hands with the hot towel that is provided, and a black plate(Slate!?!?) is placed on the ledge in front of me where I will recieve my nigiri one by one. DO NOT PLACE THIS IN FRONT OF YOU...IT IS TO REMAIN THERE THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE MEAL...THIS IS THE WAY IT IS TRADITIONALLY DONE.  My dinner begins with a PINEAPPLE SAKE APPERITIF. Aged for 100 days in house, this went down smoothly and warmed my body. the chef also informed me that they will be rotating flavors in the future.I'm not a big sake fan, but this was delicious! My appetizer was SEA SNAIL AND GEODUCK CLAM WITH CUCUMBER, RADISH, ENOKI, AND MISO DRESSING. The sweetness and crunch of the sea snail and clam paired well with the dressing and fresh vegetables.  My 10 pieces of excellence were SUZUKI, GIANT CLAM, BABY AMBERJACK, CHERRY SALMON, TORO,SNAPPER, IKURA, OPAL EYE, OH-TORO, AND ANAGO. The chef will decide what type of nigiri he thinks you will enjoy. If you read the other reviews, no one recieved the same exact thing. The Chef also adds fresh wasabi to each piece of nigiri and brushes 3-year aged shoyu or the accompanying sauce on each piece, tells you what it is and where it comes from and sets it on your plate. At this point, you are to consume each piece entirely(not multiple bites) while the rice is still at body temperature either by using chopsticks or your hands. A cool looking wooden cup with a wet towel will be provided for those using their hands. The ginger is not to be passed up either. It is crisp, sweet and has a nice heat to it(I'm assuming it is made in house as well) and was a great palate cleanser between each nigiri and digestive aid as well.  After the 10 piece chef's choice, he will offer you more nigiri or a handroll. I chose a handroll and the chef made one with TORO. I also added MISO SOUP which was also chef recommended. Using both red and white miso, this came with a piece of bone-in fish that the server called a \"rare deep sea fish.\" Great flavor and very tasty...  Dessert choices that are all made in house were Mango Sorbet, Chocolate Mousse, Layered Crepes with Strawberry Sauce and the highly suggested MOCHI ICE CREAM. The green tea, vanilla, and peanut butter mochi were a great ending to an exceptional meal.  Remember, you will never find any cream cheese stuffed, mayo baked, or yum-yum laced creations here...if you're a \"roll\" person and not big on nigiri or have no clue what it is, Kabuto is not for you...ALOHA!!!   YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(225/365) \"  My Excellent Edomae Experience\"",

    "text": "Time for me to weigh in on the so-called arrival of \"real sushi\" in Las Vegas. Long story short, Kabuto is phenomenal. If you're looking for traditional Edomaezushi, look no further. You want the freshest of sushi neta flown in from various parts of the world each day? Do you dream of meticulously constructed nigiri with just the right amount of real wasabi and a brush of aged shoyu? Your search has ended.  Every aspect of Kabuto oozes excellence. The exterior is very unassuming and elegant in its simplicity. No gaudy signs. No sign at all, in fact. Just a small window strip display lets you know you've arrived at the right place. This simple elegance continues with the interior decor. Nothing seems out of place. Do yourself a favor and sit at the beautiful cypress sushi bar. This is where the magic happens.  The quality of product is only half the story at Kabuto. There is something truly captivating about watching a highly skilled Itamae (that's probably redundant) prepare these edible works of art. Do yourself another favor--eat the nigiri with your hands. This is something I learned a long time ago, but Kabuto is the first place that I truly felt like it was the only way to go.  Now about this \"real sushi\" business, if I'm not mistaken, sushi refers to the vinegared rice. I hazard to say that the art of sushi has merely evolved. There is a place in this world for AYCE and unagi nigiri and Yum Yum Rolls. (Not that I've ever had a Yum Yum Roll, nor do I know what it even contains, but I like the fact that it seems to be the current Yelp running gag). I mean, as much as people romanticize sushi, it originated as street fast food! Then again, that sounds like fast food heaven to me.  I think I have The Avengers on the brain, but Kabuto is like Captain America. He's a little old fashioned. But as Agent Coulson states, sometimes we need a little old fashioned. Actually, Kabuto is like The Avengers film itself. No matter how elevated your expectations are, you won't walk away disappointed.  Jiro dreams of sushi. I daydream of returning to Kabuto.",

    "text": "First time - excited!  Will it live up to the hype?  What if I don't like something they serve me?  Will I even KNOW what I'm eating??  These are the questions that ran through my mind, and I have to admit I was a bit nervous.  As I pondered the menu, I decided the omakase was an amazing opportunity to try lots of new flavors so I just went for it!  We ordered a bottle of Moscato with our meal, and I was pleased with my husband's choice.  We were started off with an aperitif of mango sake made by the chef - it was a perfect little start!  With tiny bits of ice, it was really cold and sweet.  Highly enjoyable!  Our first tasty tidbit was a little salad of sea bass and seaweed.  The sea bass was tender and paired nicely with the seaweed.  I normally don't care for seaweed, but I actually enjoyed the texture of this.  Next up:  sashimi.  There was tuna was from Spain, Tasmanian trout, porgy, and a fourth one I can't remember.  I have no idea what porgy is, but it was so incredibly light and fresh.  All of the fish was fresh with delicate flavors.  Loved it!  Next up, grilled fish served with house-made soy.  The soy was as delicate as the fish with a wonderful lightly smokiness.  Nigiri course was next, and I was surprised that the rice was served warm.  When I asked the chef why it was served warm, he said it was \"...from his heart.\"  Awww....  We enjoyed kitsu (sand boter), ma-aji (jack mackerel), o-toro (premium fatty tuna), and anago (sea eel).  The quality of the fish and the expert preparation made this the best sushi I've ever had.  Ever.  For the first time, I ate my sushi without adding any wasabi or soy.  It didn't need it.  Simply enjoy the delicate flavors and texture.  Included in the omakase was soup - my husband & step-daughter enjoyed the fish and I went for the mushroom miso as well as gyoku (sweet omelet).  The gyoku is as delicate as the fish with a hint of sweetness.  We ordered a few more pieces of sushi and then finished with dessert course.  The almond tofu is a-ma-zing!  My step-daughter enjoyed three different types of mochi:  green tea, vanilla and a fruity flavor (she said it tasted like a pineapple life saver).  Looking forward to our next visit!",

We loved the o-toro and uni and had to get extra servings of those. The rice is warm and perfectly seasoned.   I love how authentic this place is and stands by their food so much so that there isn't even a huge sign with their name on the building.   TLDR; if you like authentic Japanese and love fresh fish shipped in from Japan daily--come here. Or don't so I can keep it to myself. ;)",

In terms of sushi, this is pretty decent.  I'm sure many sushi purists who find themselves living in Las Vegas would agree that this place is probably as good as it gets over there.  The regular omakase was good but not nearly enough to fill us up.  Hubby reserved his belly for more low-budget snacks later on but I went on to order a few more a la carte pieces of fish.  (That's when we found out the prices listed on the little sheet of paper they give you only includes 1 piece - not surprising but somewhat of a turnoff.)  Like many other high end sushi places, they control the flavor by brushing on some soy sauce instead of giving you a soy sauce bottle.  On some of the pieces of fish, I kind of wished for salt and yuzu/lemon to kick up the flavor of the fish.  Nice place but I'll reserve my sushi eating when I'm home in SoCal.  It seems somewhat cheaper for the same caliber.",

The dining room is very intimate and you are able to talk and hear your company in the warm ambiance. We sat at the counter and had great service. The fish was premier, we did the $120 Omakase and it was plenty of food. Will definitely go back to Kabuto!",

The is super high end omakase, we were the only non Japanese people there - people come here to spend the big bucks! The home made infused sake was awesome, so smooth to consume; the worlds thinnest beer glass. Every piece of fish was amazing, the hand rolls were out of this world - fresh daily fish flown in from Japan. I couldn't ask for more.",

    "text": "On a tip from a friend, I was told to check out Kabuto for their omakase. Of course when you think of sushi in Las Vegas I was a bit skeptical considering that they're nowhere near any port to get the freshest of seafoods. But I was pleasantly surprised by what they had to offer. They have ala carte and omakase selections. The menu changes daily based on what seafoods are available for freshness.   I went with the Yoroi, which is the mid-tier omakase selection. In it, you'll get a cup of sake, which on this night that I went, made fresh in the store. Yes you heard me, they made it at Kabuto, not the bottled stuff. It was a Yuzu flavored sake which they took 8 months to age. Very smooth and tasty. The Yoroi also gives you a sashimi platter, 3 grilled dishes, 8 pieces of nigiri, one handroll of negitoro, miso soup and dessert.  For the value ($80), it was a tasty treat. They're very creative in their presentation and flavors. For example, one of the grilled dishes I had was grilled scallop topped with an uni flavored butter sauce. Yum.  The restaurant is a bit away from the strip and downtown but parking is available or any of those ride-shares and taxis can get you there. They are very thoughtful and will offer to call you a cab after dinner as well. The service is very friendly and you can't beat a restaurant in America where everyone in the front of the house including the sushi chefs are all Japanese and from Japan for an authentic experience. Highly recommend a visit here. Just wish that the pieces were a little bigger like what you would get from an omakase in Japan or Hawaii. But seeing that they aren't in an area where fresh seafood is readily available, I understand why the pieces may be just a tad smaller. There's no drop out though as far as taste and satisfaction. Any average sushi eater will be satisfied. I've just been spoiled with eating omakase's in Japan and Hawaii.",

I will always treasure this memory and hope to return.",

They kindly confirmed who I was and sat us down at our table. The ambiance was so calm. I loved it. The waiters are kind. As we get our courses, the waiter describes what each fish is and where it's from. I honestly felt like that made so much more to the experience. Knowing what I was eating and how it was so carefully made & chosen due to the season! Before eating our meals, they gave us the option of their house made sake or house made apple juice. They asked for our ID & since I'm not 21, I got the apple juice. It was delicious. All the food was spectacular. Not only was the food great, but the service, the explanations, the setting- everything just made the night feel so put together   - we did the KABUTO set!!! At the end, you have the choice of two nigiri sushi! Yummy yummy yummy",

    "text": "Vegas has a lot of good places to eat and Kabuto is definitely on the list of one of those places. Located on spring mountain in one is the plazas. The plaza has very limited parking and tons of other restaurants in the plaza so parking is not very convenient. Reservations are highly suggested and if you come early they will have you sit and wait next to the bathrooms. Food quality is very good and if you order the kabuto omakase, it is more than enough to keep your belly full. This place definitely provides a lot of options and keeps its quality high with it. A few things I was a little disappointed at was the personal interaction with the sushi chef while sitting at the \"bar\". The sushi chef was directly across from us and the only interaction we had with him was when he provided us the nigiri. I honestly enjoy the experience and conversation with the master at work but he just seemed to be rushed and just provided us with the name of the fish and that was it. The waitresses are probably what makes this place. They were spot on with water and noticed when my GF was sharing some of her food with me so they brought us an extra plate without asking. They have a sharp eye and were super polite. The waitress definitely deserve a 5 star. unfortunately overall it could be better but they have lots of potential with small changes.",

Before you go, you should know that you can get an amazing meal for an affordable price or you can get one of the best food experiences of your life for more money, The way my wife and I looked at it was, we don't know when we'll ever be back to Vegas and how do you put a price tag on some of the best food you've ever had in your life.  From the moment we were seated we were catered too constantly, almost like they were watching trying to anticipate what we wanted or what we needed and believe me, in a very good way, making you almost feel like royalty!  We went with the Kabuto Omakase menu selection and the sake pairing, like I said, we spared no expense and left feeling it was worth every penny!  Normally I would post a picture of everything I ordered but I don't think my pictures would do this justice nor do I feel it fair to ruin a similar experience the next person might have.  A lot of people live by the saying \"eat to live, don't live to eat\" in this case, it is definitely the latter of the two!  If you were on the fence about going to this restaurant, I hope this review helps steer you through the door of Kabuto!  Thanks again!  Zeke",

    "text": "4.5 stars  First time having omakase in Las Vegas, and it was a great one. Was it the best I've ever had? Naahh. The best I've had up to date is still Sushi Zo in Los Angeles.  Simple and minimalist, Kabuto specializes in nigiri/edomae sushi. Don't come here expecting to order some baked scallop, tiger dragon roll. Sushi-mon is a few miles away for that kind of stuff. (Same owners btw!) Seating is very limited as the entire restaurant is just one sushi bar counter and 3-4 tables so make your reservations in advance.  Kabuto offers three omakase options at $48, $80, and $120, and you can even order nigiri sushi by the piece. A few a la carte items are also available on their limited menu.  My wife and I opted for the $48 omakase which includes aperitif sake, amuse, 10 pieces of nigiri, a handroll, and dessert. We ended up spending about $200 for the two of us adding a glass of wine, an order of the 5 star sashimi, and a few additional pieces of nigiri. I will highlight some of the items:   Aperitif sake- Homemade fuji (imported from Japan) apple sake, and it was a great way to start the meal. Light (2% alcohol) yet invigorating. Really good!  Amuse- mozuku topped with aoyagi (orange clam), aori-ika (king squid), and Japanese okra. This dish was super light and cleansing to the palate. The aori-ika had amazing texture. Ika is normally really chewy, but the aori-ika was so soft. It melted in my mouth! Amazing.   5 star sashimi- more along the lines of 4 star sashimi. Included blue fin tuna, halibut, king squid, scallop, and spanish mackerel. The king squid was really good once again, and the scallop was really tender and flavorful with hints of yuzu. Spanish mackerel was dry.   Ma-aji nigiri (jack mackerel)- topped with citrus soy sauce and grated scallions. Very tasty with medium oily texture. The scallions really brought out the sweetness in this fish.   Akami nigiri (blue fin tuna) from Spain- robust, rich in flavor, like a rare steak, drizzled in their house made soy sauce. I really enjoyed this blue fin nigiri.   Chu toro (medium fatty tuna) nigiri- sooo good. Creamy, soft, melted in the mouth.   Ezo-bafun uni- sweet Japanese sea urchin. The best uni I've ever tasted! It was soooo sweet and also really creamy.   Ikura (salmon roe)- served sashimi style, without rice nor seaweed. Sweet and savory with a little bit of spice from the wasabi. I could eat these eggs for breakfast every day!  Fukko (baby Japanese seabass)- a bit chewy and firm but retained a nice sweet flavor.   Toro handroll- this was the last item before the dessert. The combination of the warm sushi rice, seaweed, and toro was just mmmm orgasmic. Definitely one of the stars of the night.   For dessert, we concluded with a green tea roll cake and raspberry sorbet. The roll cake was really soft and moist, not too sweet, and the raspberry sorbet was super refreshing. The dessert was definitely the cherry on top to an excellent meal. Service was flawless as you would expect from a fine-dining sushi joint like this. The waitresses stuck to us like white on rice. Our drinks were never empty, and our plates were constantly being bussed one after another.  Vegas is saturated with ayce sushi joints, and after eating at several of them, they all start tasting the same. For those who prefer quality over quantity or want to experience sushi at some of its finest, Kabuto is the spot you are looking for.",

    "text": "This place is amazing!!! If you're in Vegas and want to venture off the strip, this is the place!  Found this place on yelp trying to get some decent Japanese food (the stuff on the strip is bad and wayyyy overpriced), this came up as a suggestion. It's located in the same shopping center as Raku, another amazing Japanese restaurant. Definitely call and make reservations as they only have about 20 seats total (counter and tables), and try to request for the counter! I saw them turn away at least 3 parties while I was there.  They have a couple of omakase options, the more expensive ones including some grilled/cooked items. I went with the cheapest option, which was the Nigiri Omakase that included aperitif sake, appetizer, 10pc nigiri, a handroll, and dessert for $48! Yes...you read that correctly...$48! What a steal. For the same meal, it definitely would have been over $100 in NYC. Everything was delicious, delicate, and of high quality, what else can you ask for :) Most amazing piece was hands down the TAMAGOOOOOOOOO. I sat next to a couple who were also from out of town but loved this restaurant so much last time that they decided to come back. When my tamago came out, they were super excited for me and began to rave about how good it was - DEF WORTH THE HYPE. It comes out steaming hot (which is pretty rare!), and has a subtle sweetness that is just perfect.  Make a reso the next time you're in vegas, you won't regret it!",

    "text": "I would pay $500 for this meal. It changed my life. I look forward to telling you about it...  Yes -- This restaurant is OFF THE STRIP.   Yes -- This restaurant requires a reservation because of how busy they can be.   Yes-- This restaurant is expensive, but it will change how you look at sushi.   Now that we got the basics covered...  THE RESTAURANT --------------------------  The restaurant maybe seats 24 people at most, they have tables, but there is almost no point of going unless you are seated at the sushi bar.      Almost every party at the sushi bar got their own sushi chef.   This sushi chef will help determine the order of which your sushi will come out to pace your palette accordingly.   Ours was an expert.   THE FOOD -----------------  When it comes to sushi, most people don't know that the quality and treatment of the rice is almost as important as the quality and the treatment of the fish.   Its hard to imagine tasting better rice or fish.  All of the fish was extraordinary. Buttery, smooth, soft, luscious, rich, pick your adjective, it doesn't matter, some of the TORO I ate was some of the sexiest, most delicious bites of food I have ever had in my life.   SERVICE ----------------- Immaculate.  Not much more needs to be said.   Michelin star quality.    RECOMMENDATIONS ------------------------------  Be prepared to spend over $100 per person and order every cut of TORO they have, which is four or five! I guarantee you will most likely never try anything that tastes like this again.   My favorites were the Hagashi Toro, and Yamashito Toro.   Also the Iced Green Tea is a must, it is the most refreshing drink you will ever taste.   Go. But don't tell too many people, because its too good, and the more people who try it, the busier they will be, the harder it will be for us to get back in.     NOTES -------------  I am omitting some of the incredible detail, like the quality of their handmade soy sauces and actual wasabi they use as opposed to the fake wasabi many lower grade sushi restaurants use.   Final Note. Expect Excellence. You won't be let down.",

    "text": "Let's first start by saying that Kabuto is going to be the most authentic experience you'll get to enjoy in Las Vegas. When I say authentic, I am also referring to the chefs and servers. It is located in a strip mall in Chinatown and is somewhat unnoticeable if you're not looking for it. The restaurant itself offers a very intimidate experience, only providing seats for up to 20 guests and 8 of those seats are at the sushi bar. What you'll encounter here is a very formal Japanese way of eating sushi in which the chef will choose your dish and prepare in front of you and deliver it directly to you.   Upon arrival, my boyfriend and I were seated amongst the sushi chefs and might I add, it was a little intimidating at first for some odd reason to have them all staring at you. We were greeted by extremely friendly servers whom brought hot towels. Afterwards, we were given a house made aperitif in a shot glass, peach to be exact, that was 2% alcohol and extremely refreshing. There are 3 different options in which you can choose from, aside from ordering a la carte. Depending on your appetite and what you want to taste depends on the option you chose. We decided to go with the $80/pp option which gave us an amuse, nigiri (8 pieces), sashimi (4 pieces), grilled items (3 varieties), hand roll, miso soup and dessert.   Of our meal, I remember the following: -Amuse that consisted of fish intestine -Sashimi: bluefin tuna, clam, octopus -Nigiri: salmon roe, uni, o-toro, chu-toro, mackerel   I personally didn't want to ruin the one-on-one experience we had with our sushi chef so I didn't take any pictures, the pictures provided was from my bf and as you can tell he wasn't able to capture everything.  All I can say is, this is seriously the most top-notch sushi and sashimi (flown in from different countries including Japan and Spain) that you will ever consume in all of Vegas and I've had sushi at many different locations, on and off the strip. Keep in mind that you CANNOT be a picky eater and have to be very open minded when dining here, as it is best experienced omakase style - when the chef chooses your meal.",

This is hands down some of the best sushi I've had in my life.   BUT. If you are looking for run of the mill sushi rolls, this is not your place. It's expensive but worth it if you are open minded and willing to try new things and think outside the box. You won't be sorry!  We were able to snag a reservation for 10pm and we were happy to get it! Definitely call ahead. We were seated at the bar in front of the work area and I am so glad we did. I very much enjoyed witnessing the action! We ordered the YOROI -   aperitif Sake / amuse / sashimi (4 kinds 8pc) / grill (3 varieties) / nigiri (8pc) / hand roll / miso soup / dessert  Everything was extraordinary and they even had this superb aged soy sauce that accompanies the meal. WOW. I don't remember everything, but my favorites were the fatty tuna sashimi, the roe, and green tea tiramasu. Holy moley. But seriously, you will be pleased with everything you get. Our selection was $80/per person but they also offer a $48/per person meal and if you are feeling extra spendy a $120/per person option. We were plenty full after our meal and even enjoyed a green tea to finish. Excellent.   Highly recommend Kabuto for sushi. It's worth the trip!",

    "text": "My experience at Kabuto was nothing short of fantastic. While it is not your traditional Sushi restaurant and nothing like an AYCE place in terms of value/food, it more than makes up for this with a quality experience and top notch food.  I'm not an expert at sushi, but this is the best I've had so far. And while the Edomae style of having the fish marinated in soy sauce may have compromised some uniqueness in flavor, the fish carries a texture that is nothing short of luxurious. Some pieces melt in your mouth, while some have some light resistance, but the fact that they can serve the items at room temperature makes it so they are more buttery than your average sushi joint.  For a first timer, I would certainly recommend sitting at the bar. Being able to watch these experts in motion and seeing how much time and effort is put into each portion of the meal is a treat. Receiving each piece of fish one by one paces out your meal in an enjoyable way.  A panda and I decided to opt for the nigiri option - $48 dollars for a small sake aperitif, amuse, 10 nigiri, a hand roll and a dessert. While still quite pricey, it is a good value especially for a first timer being able to sample a lot of different fish that I would normally have never tried. One thing that's great about Edo style is that you do not get a \"fishy\" smell or after taste - but some people certainly might miss that.  Our favorite of the night was the chu-toro, though the normal akami and many of the others were very good.   If there was one thing to nitpick, the green tea tiramisu that evening was rather bland. The texture was amazing but there was a lack of sweetness as well as a lack of green tea flavor. Additionally, the vanilla ice cream with sea salt was nothing to phone home about.  Still, I would probably admit that the subtler flavor is common in Asian-style desserts, so I wasn't surprised either.  I would highly recommend anyone who appreciates sushi to try Kabuto - I know there are similar restaurants in other cities but it was definitely a first for me, and an experience I won't soon forget.",

    "text": "Hey folks! Do you like big, crazy sushi maki with deep fried stuff sticking out of it covered in mayonnaise laden pureed leftover fish! Isn't it fun trying to cram all that craziness into your maw? Cream cheese! Wow! Do you like that? Then just do not come here because you'll get schooled in what good, real sushi is.   There's little I can add to the reviews of hundreds of people that have dined here and loved it, but what the hell, I'll give it a shot.   First, it's located in the most culinarily amazing strip mall the world has ever known. Don't be put off by the location.   I've read some other reviews that seem knowledgable quibble about the temperature of the rice and a few other details. Regardless, odds are that even among foodies this will easily be one of the top Japanese/sushi meals you'll experience. In the United States, certainly.   Because we're little piggies that love good food, my dinner date and I had an omakase plus a few more pieces a la carte. My dining companion had been before and couldn't stop raving about the place. And he knows good food better than many other people I know. Literally everything we had was sublime. However, here are a few favorites:  Mountain grape sake Fukko- baby Japanese seabass Kochi-whitefish  Akami-tuna Mejina-opal eye Inada-young yellowtail  Chopped toro Chutoro  Even the hand roll towards the end was marvelous. The nori it was wrapped in alone tasted incredible.  I also very much liked that service was thorough, efficient and not at all intrusive. Waitstaff was informative but not doing constant check-backs before you've even had a chance to chew your first bite because you're actually trying to enjoy your meal with someone else.   Prices were reasonable considering the superlative quality. Not cheap, but not astronomical either.   So don't cry yourself to sleep tonight if you can't make it out to Jiro's. Do try to come here if you're in Las Vegas instead. Might not have the same bragging rights, but you'll still have had a transcendent meal.",

    "text": "This might be the best eating of my life. It's expensive but 100% worth it Japanese food is a type of food that you enjoy.    I've eaten here twice and my feelings after my meal here were quite different each time. The very first time, I came as a younger version of myself. A broke student with a rather unsophisticated taste for Japanese food. I thought it was good but I'd didn't know exactly why, and I was focused more on how expensive it was than how really incredible the food was. I couldn't really appreciate what I didn't know enough about.     After eating here a second time many years later, I've come to the conclusion that eating is as much a reflection on yourself as it is a reflection of the restaurant. Now a working adult with a ton more experience eating Japanese sushi and food in general, I walked out of this restaurant completely blown away by almost every thing I had.   The incredibly freshness of all of the seafood, the elegance in each item served, and the service were tops. I absolutely enjoyed everything. We ordered the most expensive omakase though if I were to return I would likely stick to doing nigiri and sashimi a la carte. If you manage to get a seat at the bar which I recommend, the Japanese sushi chefs (when not busy preparing food) were happy to talk a bit about the food. They look really serious but were friendly and polite when I asked them a few things. I think maybe they were more open to chat because I was so visibly happy with my experience there.",

    "text": "Well it's my second time in 2 weeks....hahaha, and i've been here even before the real opening year and 8 months ago.    I just can't say enough good things about this place.    Sure there are a few haters who claim they have eaten better sushi in Japan.  Yeah so what, I have too.  I bet not many (any?) here have eaten at as many Michelin starred sushiya's in Tokyo or other sushiyas all over Japan as I have and I still love Kabuto.  And the cardinal rule of evaluating Japanese food in the US with naive audiences?  Don't compare with what you can get in Japan--you aren't there and it's irrelevant.  Having said that, Kabuto comes VERY close to eating at a PROPER sushiya in Japan.  In some respect, it might be better than a LOT of proper places in Ginza as Kabuto has a good, I mean GOOD selection of white fish from Kyushu which a lot of edomae places in Tokyo who get fish from Tsukiji don't, but that's another story.  As some of us know, edomae really doesn't exist if you know what that really means besides from the style.   I wonder how many authentic sushiyas are in the U.S. that didn't sell out and start making weird rolls.  I say 2 or 3 at most.  Vegas is lucky to have one.  If you can't appreciate it, don't go.  Leave those precious 10 seats for the rest of us, although I only sit at one of 4 counter seats.    This is probably the MOST satisfying meal I can get in Vegas, for any price.",

    "text": "We did the $80 omakase and had to order more a la carte pieces of sushi afterwards because we were still hungry. The quality of the sushi is top notch. There were some pieces we enjoyed and some not so much. They didn't include otoro in the omakase, so we ordered it a la carte, and boy it was good! Just melts in your mouth. They're also a lot more generous with the portion size when you order a la carte compared to the omakase.  Our waitress and sushi chef were very attentive to our needs and explained everything thoroughly. We split a bottle of the Ginga Shizuku (Junmai Daiginjo). Probably one of the best sake's that I tasted in my life. It had a nice hint of melon to it.   The one gripe I have about the restaurant... The seats at the sushi bar are too low. Anytime I got up to go to the bathroom or when we left, my quads were shot. My friend and I are power lifters when it comes to anything from the waist down, and we were in pain for at least a half hour.  Our bill came out to $500 or so after tax/tip ordering the bottle of sake, doing the $80 omakase, and ordering a bunch of a la carte sushi pieces for a group of 3. I probably wouldn't make a return trip here, but for a first time dining off strip I would recommend Kabuto.",

    "text": "I agonized a lot over my star rating for this review. There is no doubt in my mind that Kabuto has the best fish quality of any sushi place I've tried in Las Vegas. Kabuto also has the most interesting selection of fish as far as authentic Japanese sushi of any sushi place I've tried in Las Vegas. And the decor of this place is just lovely - it's like being back in Japan. The bottom line is if I'm in Vegas and I want good authentic sushi, Kabuto is where I go. Gosh, I'm raving on and on about this place - so why four stars and not five?  I try to review restaurants based on what the restaurants are. I'm not going to complain about how pricy a gourmet multi-course extravaganza at a  *** Michelin restaurant is, just as I'm not going to complain about the somewhat lacking service at a fast food joint or Strip tourist trap. This is where the problem with Kabuto lies;  they make themselves out to be an edomae sushi restaurant. When I judge them on that basis, that is where they lose one star.  The first problem is that when ordering one of the set menus, all the sushi is pre-sliced as soon as the order is placed. Then, each individual sushi is made and presented. This is a huge no-no for edomae style; the fish should only be sliced during the process of making each piece of sushi. Of course, this issue can be avoided by ordering a la carte - but nevertheless, it just shouldn't be what's done at an edomae sushi joint.  The second problem is the huge temperature control problem on the rice. This has been a problem on each of my many visits here; it's almost as if they don't even try to make the rice temperature consistent. When the rice is delivered from the kitchen, it is very warm, and of course that makes the sushi quite warm. After a while, it cools down, and then it better resembles \"normal\" sushi, but during a meal at Kabuto I will typically experience a whole gradient of temperatures - sometimes more than once. This absolutely should not happen; the rice temperature should be consistent. Anyone who has ever gone to an edomae place knows this. Heck, even anyone who has watched Jiro and never eaten sushi before knows this.  And to be clear, this is not a warm rice vs room temp rice issue. (I actually have never had a warm rice edomae experience, not even in the dozens of edomae place I've tried in Japan, but I once read an article suggesting that as many as 10% of Japanese edomae sushi chefs subscribe to the warm rice practice. But again, that's not the issue, since the problem at Kabuto is that the rice temp varies considerably.)  Anyway - if you love sushi, you will probably enjoy Kabuto, so go and enjoy it. Just be aware of these shortcomings as far as Kabuto's execution, which IMO definitely warrant a one-star deduction.",

    "text": "I like that the only thing that leads you here is word of mouth and a small rectangular window. As usual, I'm late to the party trying this place, but I had been saving it to experience it with good company. I was living on the edge and decided to see if they had any reservations left for that night, which happened to be a Friday, and to my excitement, 8pm available. We had requested to sit at the bar so we could watch the Itamae at work.   Of course starting with a bottle of white wine, while we decided what to order, which took all of 2 minutes, we went with the Kabuto Omakase Course.  We were started out with aperitif Sake prepared by the chef and then as appetizer of Black Squid and Toro that melted in your mouth.  Next up was the 5 piece sashimi course that included, that inlcuded a Shigoku Oyster, I was so excited to try, I forgot to take a picture first (I love oysters).   Next was the 5 piece grilled platter, which included a centerpiece of Sazae, cooked portion is usually my least favorite of Omakase, this one no different, I really only enjoyed one piece and I can't remember the name of the fish.  Now for the Edomae style service, this starts the Nigiri portion. We were given a slate that is kept in between you and the chef the entire time so he can serve you one piece at a time and also served with just the right amount of wasabi and soy sauce made by them, and I really liked the warm rice. By this time we had finished the wine and started on Sake, so my picture taking was forgotten and a little shotty. In no particular order:  o-toro chu-toro akami chikamekintoki mejina houbou ma-saba handroll ikura  Miso soup with shrimp head and gyoku  Our server Naomi was so informative, explaining each fish and the region it came from, she had also made a special request for me to the chef to let him know my favorite Japanese Mackerel was on the menu, and he made sure to make that apart of the Omakase.   We ended the meal with Green Tea Tiramisu and a Custard filled balloon dessert that was fun to pop, it came with a Swedish FIsh filled with caramel that you poured over the custard. Reminded me of Panna Cotta.  This is by far the best sushi I've had since Tsukiji Fish Market.",

The place is immaculate, no splotches of soy sauce anywhere, not a speck of dust.  Kabuto embodies what a real Japanese restaurant is: clean, beautifully simple and pure.  If you're an ultra fan of AYCE sushi places that serve deep-fried rolls, rolls with spicy mayo (bastardized sushi, in short) - this may not be the place for you.  Now, I say that only because I've actually stood in line at 5am at Tsukiji Fish Market to watch a tuna auction and have had fresh sushi at 6am in Japan - nobody served Cali rolls or tempura rolls.  I like both the purist version and the bastardized version.  To find a Japanese restaurant in Vegas that serves fish, rice, wasabi and soy sauce (and nothing else) as sushi is rare.  You won't get wasabi or a small saucer to pour soy sauce in - all that will be taken care of by the sushi chef (Sushi Etiquette 101: do not dip rice onto soy sauce; put wasabi on top of the fish not into the soy sauce).  The whole time I was at Kabuto, all I could do was smile as I watch the sushi chef delicately slice up some fish.  I had Bach's \"Cello Suite No. 1\" playing in my head because the experience will remind you of \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\".    I had the 4 of the o-toro (premium fatty tuna), kamashita, chu-toro (medium fatty tuna), anago (eel), akami (tuna), ikura (salmon roe), zuke (tuna marinated in special soy) and gyoku (sweet egg).  I don't normally like eel.  My sister (who likes eel)ordered it but she  was afraid to eat it maybe because it wasn't covered in eel sauce.  I liked it...well, I liked everything I ate!  It's sushi in which the fresh fish is the main event (as it should) and rice is just an add-on.  My sister, however, had a different experience from mine.  She didn't hear a cello playing in her head.  She had that worried look.  I asked her what's wrong and she told me, \"I'm just not an adventurous eater.\"  So, I quickly ordered dessert so I could take her somewhere else.  Poor thing.  I had the matcha cake.  It's a green tea chiffon cake with a hint of red bean.  It's mildly flavored and not sweet at all.  Now, if you're from Seattle...Kabuto is similar to Shiro's. Oishi! Gochisosama!",

For 1, it's off the strip, for 2, so many good restaurants on the strip, that I never got around to come here. I'm so glad I finally did and I went all out.        Our driver dropped us off and I couldn't find the location. It's between the BIG WONG Chinese restaurant and the wine bar. Kabuto has no big sign, you can miss it completely. The place is small, minimalist decor, very low sushi bar, remind you of Japan, as close as to a nice sushi joint in Japan as you can get.   - Miso soup with fishbones  - Miso soup with Amaebi head  - Nigiri 5 pieces and sashimi 10 pieces extra order  - KABUTO  $120 Aperitif sake  Appetizer  Sashimi platter (5 kinds 10pc)  Grill platter (5 varieties) Nigiri (12pc)  Hand roll  Dessert       Kabuto Edomae Sushi is truly a bargain, for the amount of food and the excellent quality for fishes flown in from Japan, East Coast, North West, and where else, super fresh. This would cost me at least $300 at Blue Ribbon at the Cosmopolitan or $250 at the Mizumi at the Wynn.       Chef Ken and a 3 more chefs working at the sushi bar of 10 seats, another 3 tables behind us. Yup, it's about 22 seats max and its always packed. Chef Ken gave us the menu of all the 28  'possible' fishes that we might had that day. Some of the fishes I've never heard of in my life.          At the end of the dinner, we had about 23, including: Kamashita fatty tuna, Sanma pacifc pike, konage anago golden sea eel, hie0tai star snapper, fukko baby Japanese seabass, chikamekintoki long finned bull eye, harasu trout belly, renko-tai deep sea porgy, aoyagi oragne clam, hira-aji coastal trevally, and much more!        The rice was perfectly moist, smooth, cooked perfectly, and chef serves very little on nigiri. Chef serves as you go. Not everyone at the sushi bar has the same fishes, even though the couple next to us ordered the Kabuto as well.        Watching chef Ken and other chefs meticulously prepared the sushi for us were such a joy. Everything is in order, structure, and extremely clean. It makes me appreciate everything I put in my mouth a whole lot more. This is sushi that makes with love, pride, passion, and commitment.       The service is impeccable. Our Japanese server is very soft spoken with heavy accent, but she knows the food and wine more than anything else. Anytime I asked a question, she knows the answer right away without blinking her eyes, WOW.        The server even call the taxi for us on our way out. The service is top notch. I'm so glad to finally got to visit Kabuto Edomae Sushi and I'm so looking forward to revisit it again. Kabuto is definitely a MUST TRY when you are in Vegas. It's only 2.5 miles off the strip in Chinatown, 15 minutes drive with traffic from the strip.",

Order the nigiri servings (50 bones) - You'll get 10 pieces so expect to still be hungry afterwards  I won't talk about the fishes because it will forever change, as it should because of the quality.  When you call, reserve the bar area.  Screw the tables, he'll make your nigiri pieces and it'll sit on a plate until all of them are made and then served to you (screw that).  Clean your hands with the warm towel.  Get the nigiri courses.  Make sure you have the small cup with clean paper tower inside to dab your fingers clean, you'll need it later.  Take a shot of your sake drink.  Eat whatever until you get to the nigiri serving.  When the chef puts the piece down in front of you, dab your fingers clean and tilt the nigiri piece over to it's side, then roll it over with your clean fingers so the fish is under the rice, put it in your mouth so your tongue touches the fish first.  Ahhh, mmmmm.    Eat it right away, no matter what even if you're having a heart attack from the mmmmm mmmm mmm.  Don't hold it up and ask what it is, just pay attention because he will tell you BUT EAT IT ALREADY!!  Then ask any other question you may have.  Repeat with the clean fingers, ginger eating, fish touching the tongue first (mmmm).  Eat your handroll and appreciate the sushi wrapper, it is the best.  I believe the dried seaweed is $200 a package but it tastes and breaks down it's worth, trust me.    Marvel at each nigiri piece.  You leave it up there then it's a sign of disrespect and you'll look like a noob.  Actually you are a noob if you leave it up there because the quality of the rice and fish goes down the second it touches the plate in front of you.  Eat it right away!!  One day you'll be pro like me: walk in, eat, walk out.  I know it's not a review but appreciate this guideline!",

You can inform them of your allergy or things that you don't eat & they will accommodate your requests.   I usually order the smallest/cheapest course that came with 8 nigiri and a sushi roll for around $50. Very reasonably priced especially if you compare it to prices you see at the restaurants on the strip.   Try to snag at seats at the sushi bar. You will be able to see the chef's preparing your meal. These chefs are so meticulous in preparing everythinv. It is almost too pretty to eat.",

    "text": "You can find some damn good food off the strip in Vegas if you just decide to schlep on down to Spring Mountain Road and find the Asian part of town. Say 10-12 years ago, these places would have probably died off, because nobody's going to venture this far outside of the glitz to find food, but thanks to the internet these joints actually have a chance to survive and thrive. So, first off, a big pat on the back for those of us who venture forth!  Now onto the food. I don't usually throw down 5 stars, because I think people have a pretty binary way of writing reviews. Either they love a place to death and the give it a 5, or something ticked them off and they slap down a 1. I like to save my 5s for places that, once I've been there, if you tell me that you're making a run to go to this place, I will never refuse to join you.  This is one of those places. We arrived in Vegas at like 7:30 on a Thursday, and asked for reservations on Friday. They said they had none. I asked if they had reservations for tonight, and they said they did. Booya. We made the down to Spring Mountain and our party of 3 was graciously seated in this restaurant that maybe could fit 15 people on a good day.  Probably because of this, they generally try and have you choose from one of their 3 tasting courses: Nigiri, Yoroi, or the third one that I forgot. I opted for the yoroi, while my friends who had been there before decided to save their stomachs for ordering a la carte stuff and opted for the nigiri.  Pretty much everything they put out there was tasty (though I wouldn't necessarily recommend eating most of the edible arrangements. I'm not a big fan of shiso leaf, personally.) and some of the things were well beyond what I was expecting.  I generally HATE uni. I've described the taste to my friends as \"tripping while walking along the beach and falling into the sand with your mouth open.\" Vaguely salty, with a high chance of particulate matter. All that with the disconcerting texture of limp egg custard. What's not to love, right? Well, here at Kabuto, the uni was tolerable. Which means that everyone who actually likes it will probably find that it's amazing.  The other thing that is super amazing here is the toro. Generally, if you see bluefin on the menu, it's a bad thing. Bluefin tuna are being hunted to extinction in the Pacific by greedy fisherman. Spanish bluefin have made a healthy comeback due to responsible practices, and so I'm trusting that everyone is being above board on this. The chu-toro (medium fatty tuna) was really, really good. It's what would be served as \"fatty tuna\" everywhere else I've been. But they had two grades that were even fattier, including jabara-toro, which is apparently the fattiest part of the fish. Looking at it, it seemed more like well marbled steak than it did fish. It may actually be too rich for me, but you gotta try it once.  For dessert, they served me black sesame ice cream with sea salt and roasted sesame seeds. A great meal. Will definitely be back.",

Better than anything the Strip can offer and actually priced well for the quality and quantity.  We were STUFFED from the Kabuto omakase.    The chefs just do their thing and occasionally look over, so I don't feel so pressured to give positive feedback after EVERY SINGLE bite.    Even the desserts were good.  I usually don't love Japanese desserts.  The pastry chef makes everything in house, including the ice cream in the mochi balls.  Tofu cheesecake, fluffy and delectable, I didn't miss the cow.  A little over $200pp with flowing Masumi sake.  Worth, every, penny.    I am already longingly thinking about my next meal here and plan to have it on the regular rotation.

The house green tea is delicious, and they very generous with it - at no charge. The space is really small, so it can get pretty loud, so it was extremelly difficult to hear the soft spoken chefs and hostess. The food was ok. The best part was the nigiri portion of the meal.

I won't elaborate that much more, since you don't really get a choice when ordering there.  It's all Omakase menu, and you just choose between 3 different prices.

Most of the items you eat are not what you will find in other Japanese restaurants so the price paid kinda make sense. If you are looking for a bargain, don't come here. If you are looking for an experience, do come here. To sum it up with 3 words: friendly, attentive, delicious.",

    "text": "TEN THOUSAND STARS. Be sure you call ahead of time to get reservations, since slots are very limited and they only have dinner servings twice an evening.   I got the Yaroi and he got the Kabuto. Both were fantastic. The ingredients are extremely fresh and so delightful. As one reviewer said, it is indeed more like enjoying a work of art and less of a relaxing kick-back-your-shoes kind of place, but it's worth it. Everything was meticulously created and it was truly a unique experience.   Our hostess was Sakiko, and she was absolutely amazing--extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and super pleasant in general. The chefs are all professional and serious about their art.   Wish we lived closer because this place is a True gem--down to their delicious homemade sake and cute toothpicks. Go go go!",

    "text": "I came to vegas to finally try this place out and could only get the seat on a table instead of the bar. You must make reservations in advanced and kabuto is in the same plaza as raku!   Interior - is pretty standard, just a sushi bar, and couple small tables. seems like it could fit about 20ppl max at a time!  Food - I ordered 2 ten piece sushi orders and many other sushis a la carte and I have to say that the food was really delicious, but definitely not worth it. It comes with a variety of different sushi's and they will all taste really bomb, but CAUTION the portions are EXTREMELY SMALL.   Service - is really amazing. waitresses are on top of their game and make you feel like royalty. loved the service here.  Presentation - the sushi is beautiful prepared and looks amazing; however I don't really care about presentation. I only care about quality, quantity, and cost!  Overall I'd rate it a 3.5 and this is because I spent about $300 for 2 people and I was still left STARVING. The portions are too ridiculously small where you can get better quality sushi and either same price or cheaper in LA. I must say that the sushi's were really good, but I've had better at half the price with double the amount of food. Considering how hard it is to get reservations, and how ridiculously expensive this place is, I expected more. Sorry for the natives in LV, but LA has better sushi. Not worth it, and I would rather eat at Raku which is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I'm a very picky omakase eater. Perhaps, that is an understatement.  Having tried the 2 most expensive restaurants in America (MASA in NYC and Urasawa in Beverly Hills) and countless omakases around the world, this place took me by surprise.  Let me start by saying that the way the itamae prepares the food reminds me of traditional Japanese style of sushi.   They were prepared delicately and delectably. No sauce overpowered the fish, or took away the freshness of the fish.  Also, kudos to make good gyoku aka tamagoyaki, a sweet omelette that is hard to make fluffy. While I think Urasawa still makes the best tamago in America, Kabuto can take the second place in my heart. A forgotten art which they manage to do so beautifully.  Go for the Kabuto Omakase, priced at $120 which is cheap compared to masa and urasawa.  I ordered extra food even though I was extremely full because it was that good. Since the aburi otoro wasn't in the list, I had to give it a try. And I also ordered extra ezo bafun uni that was flew in fresh from Japan. Not those santa babara uni crap that we get in most restaurants in the U.S.  The only 2 things they can improve on is the rice and the shrimp cake in  the grilled selection. That shrimp cake was the only dish I hated.  I should also point out that they use freshly grated wasabi here at Kabuto which they mentioned was flown in from Japan. A huge must for me when I have omakase.  The quality of this sushi can't even be compared to the \"famed\" but overly priced Nobu or Sushi Roku on the strip. Both of which I've tried in Vegas and in LA, and both of which were terribly disappointing. So, don't even bother going to Nobu or Roku when you can have Kabuto.  Even comparing omakase to the above average/acceptable omakase places in LA such as Yamakase, Ootoro or Ken's Japanese Restaurant, Kabuto puts them to shame.  While their location is not in a fancy location, it's cosy and minimalistically decorated. I love it.  It is weird that they serve the miso soup at the end, but I can see why - to wash down your food after being stuffed with food.  I'm going to make it a point to go to Kabuto every time i'm in Vegas in the future.",

    "text": "OH.  MY.  GOSH.  Decided it was time to go back to Vegas for football and fine dining (the last time was a 36 hour non stop double birthday trip with all the besties). Anyways, after quite a lengthy search, I came across Kabuto and immediately called to make reservations, a month in advance.   This chic little sushi spot is in the heart of Chinatown surrounded by tons of restaurants, massage parlors, and shops. If you don't know what you're looking for, you'll probably miss it. There's a shop next door with a GIANT spoon, Bingo! You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.   Once you walk in, there's a long sushi bar that seats ~10 and 3-4 tables that seats medium sized groups, a total of 22 or so, I believe. They have two seatings a night. One at 6:00pm (not 6:30, remember this!) and one at 8:30pm. Reservations are required and you'll likely be turned away without them since they even have wait lists for the evening. It's a pretty low key atmosphere and very simply decorated.   We show up all fance and I excitedly give them my name and...and...and... they tell me they don't have a seat for me. For some reason, I thought our reservation was for 6:30 and not 6:00! They gave our seats away (after calling, except my phone was at the Apple store and they had no way to reach me). The lady said if we wanted to get on the wait list for the night she would put us on there. So, with no hopes of dining at Kabuto I left with no appetite for anything else and the saddest face ever.   An hour or so later, ring ring, it's Kabuto!! There was another party that was a no show and they ask if we'd still like to dine there tonight. Um YESPLEASEOMG.   We go all the way back to Chinatown, and upon arrival are seated at the end of the bar. We decide on the Kabuto menu, serving Edomae tradition of sushi. It's a pretty penny but 1000bajillion and 1% worth it. They start you off with a delicious house-made sake which sets you up for how delicious the meal is.  Course after course, everything was plated beautifully, absolutely delicious, and the service was impeccable.   We were chatting with the sushi chef that mentioned the fish comes straight from Japan with a 17 hour turn around. SEVENTEEN HOURS. HOLY COW (err FISH), this place is another level. The quality, freshness, and deliciousness is probably the closest you'll get to being in Tokyo, outside of Tokyo.  Shoutouts to my faves: fresh wasabi, wakaremi, kamasu, ma-tai and the escargot.  Every bite you eat here will be just as good as the last you ate, if not better.",

    "text": "Kabuto is as good as it gets in Las Vegas. From the service to the precision to detail this place checks off all the boxes. Kabuto is a tough reservation as they only have two seatings in about 25 seat restaurant but definitely keep checking back. Kabuto operates on a prix fixe matte with additional a la carte options if you're still hungry. We opted for a couple of the $120 Kabuto options and a couple $80 middle options. The main difference I noticed was two extra sashimi, and an additional uni, nigiri, or oyster in each course. The deal is pretty good compared to just getting the middle and ordering those items on your own. We also had a few sakes which ranged all over the place. But there are 10oz options in the $30-40 range and $70 options in the 24oz range.   The meal was a little over 2 hours but once it gets going there isn't much downtime. The order of the dishes is a little weird with miso soup at the end but no matter each course was fresh and perfect. We began with a fresh, in house sake to clear our palettes. We then were given tremendous amounts of tuna, yellow fish, clam, uni, roe, and many more for the next hour or so. With about 5 varieties on each plate throughout the first couple of courses it's tough to detail each, but some standouts were the uni and roe and some passes were octopus and crab salad. We ended the Emma with some black sesame panna cotta and cheesecake. Both solid but after so much food honestly unnecessary and unneeded as the quality didn't match the intricacies and precision in flavor of the previous courses.   The entire meal was well worth the money and could rival any Japanese tasting. At $120, the deal is ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised if you find this identical meal for $300 in New York with 3x prices on sake. Kabuto has been on my must try list for the past two years. Been a long wait but now I'm craving more of the most freshest foods you can imagine. Each has a story and an origin of where it's from and how prepared. Truly a remarkable meal and perfect for an introduction into fine Japanese cuisines or simply just a seafood lover.",

    "text": "Two words: absolutely amazing.  I freaking love this place, the food was delicious, the service was impeccable and the price was pretty reasonable for an omakase meal.    We opted for the $80 omakase course, I really wanted to do the $120 one, but really didn't think I can finish that much food.  I was right, I was incredibly stuffed at the end of the meal.  For the $80 course, you get aperitif sake, amuse, 4 kinds of sashimi, 3 grill varieties, 8 piece of nigiri, a hand roll, miso soup and dessert.  Let's start with the aperitif sake, it was super light, I think only 4% alcohol, slightly sweet, very refreshing and a perfect way to start the meal.  My husband wanted to order a carafe of it, but I've decided to opt for a carafe of Nanbubijin instead, which was the perfect sake to accompany our ensuing meal.  I won't bore you by listing all of the courses, but will just highlight some of my favorites.  Out of the four different kind of sashimi, the oyster was hand's down the best piece, it was lightly seasoned and tasted extremely fresh, as if it was plucked right out of the sea.  With regard to nigiri, I was obsessed with the itoyori bream, which I've never had before.  It was heaven on Earth, the beautiful piece of fish was lightly brushed with a sauce and lime shaving.  I loved it so much that I've asked for an additional piece, which was a bargain at an additional $5.  The Japanese mackerel was a close second.  My least favorite course was the miso soup, which had the option of bone-in fish or mushroom.  We tried one of each and neither was something to write home about.  The presentation of the courses was beautiful, I loved the small bowl that served the ikura.  There was an average of one sushi chef per two guests at the bar, which meant you got undivided attention, while the servers appeared to have an average of 4 guests each.  The service was prompt but unobtrusive.    Overall, it was a great dining experience, it was one of my favorite meals out of our one week trip to CA and LV.  In a city with numerous dining options, I feel like Kabuto wins for both quality and value.",

The courses are as follows: apertif sake, appetizer, sashimi platter (5), grilled platter (5), nigiri (12), hand roll, miso soup, and dessert. Each course was absolutely delicious and loved every bite. The detail of each plate is great, the fish is incredible fresh, and the different flavors are amazing. I love how each piece is explained and that there is a list of the fish along with the Japanese name so you know what you're eating. It's funny how each course is a tiny platter or one piece of nigiri, yet you leave full! The atmosphere is very minimalist with only a couple tables and the long counter, and the outside of the restaurant is simple. I think the food speaks for itself and not much else is needed inside!",

So far this restaurant is 100% nothing to point out, except their reservation system is terrible whatever owner think this is the best, I do not agree.

Also, their sushi bar area only has two time slots (6:00 pm and 8:30 pm).   So we had the ($48 pp): 10 piece nigiri set that came with monk fish and a handroll. They start you off with a 2% sake drink that is sweet to help open the palate. Besides the fact that all the nigiri used fresh and high quality fish, I believe that this place stands out because their sushi rice was made well and kept at the optimal warm temperature. Additionally, they used real wasabi, which is pretty rare. Also, the soy sauce is some imported and aged soy sauce so you only use a little bit at a time. My favorite pieces were the chu-toro (medium fatty tuna) and the trout (the orange one that looks like salmon).   This place definitely lives up to the reviews, and I'd be happy to come here again to try the full omakase menu.",

    "text": "4.5/5 - Would definitely go again and recommend to friends  Over time we've come to learn that we really enjoy the nigiri portion of the omakase the most, so rather than going with more extensive omakase courses as we had in times past, this time we went straight for the nigiri omakase. An apertif sake, an amuse bouche (zuke maguro w pickles in our case), 10 pieces of nigiri, a handroll and a dessert for $48?! Coming from the Bay Area that's an absolute steal! And the a la carte menu had a bunch of interesting options that I had never seen before, so we needed to leave some room to explore unknown waters.  We started with the sake apertif, which was nice and light but a little overly sweet for my tastes. Moving onto the amuse though, that really surprised me. I generally find tuna to be among my least preferred fish, but the zuke maguro was plump, flavorful and delicious. Turned out to be the theme of the night, I loved every variation of tuna I was handed, and even ordered more after the nigiri course was over! I don't know whether it was because the tuna they had was bluefin tuna sourced from Spain or whether they just prepared it a special way, but that was hands down the best tuna I've ever had. But I digress.  Anyways, overall the nigiri course was very good. Every piece I had was at least enjoyable, though I think not all the pieces were quite to my taste.  The preparation of the nigiri was all pretty minimalist, there isn't too much garnishing on the fish to obscure its natural flavors. I thought the rice was fairly well done, with a nice rich flavor and a good temperature. I think a few of the bites were maybe a little on the mushy side, but for the most part it was a good texture and a good flavor.  Ranked from my favorite to least, we had: hagashi otoro (silky fatty tuna) *chutoro (medium fatty tuna) *akami (lean tuna)  chikamekintoki (long finned bull eye)  *ma-tai (red snapper)  *ma-hata (sevenband grouper)  zuke (soy marinated tuna) *kogane anago (golden sea eel)  renko-tai (deep sea porgy)  isaki (striped pig) *gyoku (egg omelette) *ikura (salmon roe) *ma aji (jack mackerel)  yokosuji fue-tai (spotstripe snapper) *Inada (young yellowtail) *tori-gai (heart shell clam)  *included in omakase  The tuna was all surprisingly good and I've never had the long finned bull eye before but the texture and mild sweetness on that was a nice surprise. The handroll was also fatty tuna, and delicious + well made. For dessert we had the choice of cheesecake, mango sorbet and green tea ice cream. We chose the cheesecake and the sorbet, but the cheesecake was definitely the better of the two - if you've had the sorbet at Raku Sweets then you know what it tastes like. .  I would say that the service on the side of the waitstaff was very good, polite and respectful yet friendly, as you might expect at a nice Japanese place. I think that as far as the sushi chef goes though, the pacing felt rushed to me....during the formal course it was essentially one piece right after the other, with not enough time to really savor and think about what I had eaten. After I ate a piece, I had maybe a minute before the next piece arrived, which simply meant that they were prepping the next piece nearly as soon as they had put the previous piece down. Perhaps some people like that speed of service, but I think it was pretty clear that my girlfriend and I were a little overwhelmed by how quickly everything coming out and I wished the chef had noticed and took it down a notch. I do appreciate not having to wait, but in a nicer place like this I would like to think that I could enjoy my food comfortably. Overall though, the food itself was great and the experience was good.",

    "text": "Why doesn't Yelp have the option to give 10 stars?  Kabuto deserves it all.  This restaurant is amazing and most certainly the best sushi in Las Vegas.  This restaurant only seats 20.  Reservations are required.  We made our reservations three months in advance.  There are two seatings nightly - one at 6 p.m. and the later one is probably 8:30?  I'm not totally positive as I had the earlier seating.  Try to get a seat at the sushi bar so you can see the sushi masters at work.  The restaurant is small, but clean, and minimalistic in design.  The menu has various types of omakase and we went with the middle option, the Yoroi.  We started with a mild apple sake made in-house, which was refreshing and crisp.  We moved onto an amuse, various types of sashimi, various types of grilled fish (the king salmon was especially delightful), nigri sushi, a tuna hand roll, miso soup in which you can choose 3 types and a mild cheesecake dessert.  In addition, we ordered a la carte every single type of blue fin toro sushi they had.  YOU MUST DO THIS, IT IS LIFE CHANGING.  It is best enjoyed starting with the leanest type or toro and ending with the fattiest type of toro.  Every course, every bite of this meal was memorable.  The staff are unbelievably attentive and there are quite a number of staff on hand to ensure wonderful service.  I didn't want to leave.  Kabuto, I will be back!",

    "text": "If you're in Las Vegas and want to impress your date with the fact that you have money to burn, take them to Nobu.  If you truly appreciate the Edomae tradition of sushi, you need to be here.  If you've ever been to Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market you know what I mean.    Located in the Chinatown section of LV, in a small strip mall with great aromas from noodle shops and other Asian restaurants, you will easily miss it as the sign and entrance are small and nondescript.  It's worth the effort to find the place though, and you will not be disappointed.    They have two seatings each evening at 6:00 and 8:30 in the classically minimalist 22 seat venue.  We were very lucky to get a table by calling ahead the same day. The counter is the place to be as always but we were 3 and happy to have a table.  I was somewhat amused when making the reservation, as she told me it's not good for children, all sushi is raw, no rolls, and no fried items.  I replied \"As it should be\".  They have an extensive sake menu and I recommend you opt for a higher end offering as it will then be on a par with the food you will receive.    It is Omekase style with three price points, the most expensive at $120 and worth every penny.  I am not going to continue with a recitation of the courses.  They are all amazing.  Let's just say they didn't bother to mention that the Wasabi is freshly grated, and that tells you a bit about the quality of the food.   Don't take your friends to this place if they gravitate towards rainbow rolls and tempura, take the friends that are special people in your life (although that may of course include some of the former).  They will love you for it and will have a new perspective on sushi.  P.S.  - I think Jiro would approve of this restaurant.  Not only is the fish great, they also know how to do the rice perfectly as well.",

We had a uni tasting of 4 types and an otoro tasting of 4 types.   Surprisingly the akami (lean meat) really held up to everything! I usually hate the akami but they aged and cut it just enough to create an amazing meaty and tender texture.   My favorite is usually the engawa and when i ordered it twice, i got 2 different preparations. I didn't think i would like it more with just salt but it was awesome.   Great place a will be a regular stop when i'm in town.",

    "text": "I've learned that some of the best food in Vegas is OFF the strip! This plaza was surely popping with people, not sure if it was with locals or tourists who learned the secret.  Kabuto is small but very clean and modern. A white space with all Japanese chefs and servers. Our waitress was very cute and animated.  The menu choices are all omakase:   NIGIRI $48 aperitif sake / amuse / nigiri (10pc) / hand roll / dessert  YOROI $80 aperitif sake / amuse / sashimi (4 kinds) / grill (3 varaieties) / nigiri (8pc) / hand roll / miso soup / dessert  KABUTO $120 aperitif sake / appetizer / sashimi platter (5 kinds) / grill platter (5 varaieties) / nigiri (12pc) / hand roll / miso soup / dessert  We all opted for the $80 which let us try a bit of everything and were stuffed by the end.  *The aperitif sake was very light, only 2% alcohol and a bit fruity. It was refreshing *Our amuse was a fish male organ. It looked like a brain so I could not look at it straight while eating it but it was nicely marinated in a ponzu sauce with cucumber. The combination of all of it was very tasty *For sashimi, we had a juicy oyster, clam, yellowtail and a white fish that we ate with a seaweed paste.  *For the grilled platter, we had a fish with bruleed miso paste on top, a a crab salad and yellowtail collar bone *For the nigiri, we had 5 types of fish including a toro, fish roe, egg and a nice uni with rice *The hand roll was tuna and it was very different from the other hand rolls I've had. The seaweed apparently is from a popular place in Japan and it was so crunchy and good *For the miso soup, we had a choice of mushroom, fish or shrimp head. I had the fish one *For dessert, we had a choice of sesame panna cotta or Japanese cheesecake  All the courses were very good but not all fish were \"melt in your mouth\" good. I did like that we had a variety of items and not just fish  Service was great and I really appreciated knowing my meal came from many different parts of the world.  4.5 stars. Recommended!!!!",

    "text": "TL;DR, this place is uncontested as the best sushi in Vegas. The quality of fish, experience with chefs and waitresses, and overall ambiance is deserving of its price point and praise.  I'll preface this review saying that I normally don't leave reviews. But Kabuto is an exception in that it left such an impression on me that I've caught myself thinking about it even days after my dinner.  My girlfriend and I entered the restaurant for our Valentines date. The location is in one of the more famous Chinatown plazas with big names such as the Raku(s) and Hwaro. However, it doesn't try to catch your eye with flashing lights and posters. The exterior is bland, a small window barely enough to catch a glance of the chefs and bar. Above it, a dark \"Kabuto\" with a dim backlight. The only other indication you're at the right place is the Japanese-style paper box light by the door. It gives you the impression that you're about to enter with exclusivity.  We had a 6pm reservation when they first open. The waitresses confirmed our names and took us to our seat by the bar immediately. Pulled out our chairs and pushed them in. With no hesitation, she acquainted us with the menu and how the place operated. They also took into consideration any allergies or preferences, addressing them to the chef. We were given hot hand towels to clean up before the meal and the waitresses themselves placed a napkin over your lap. At the bar you can see the chefs work their magic with passion, you could watch them cut and prepare each piece with precision and grace. If anyone described the interior as over-the-top, they'd be flat out wrong. It is plain, clean, and simple. The decor was pretty but not at all distracting. The sushi and chefs take center stage.  After the waitress brought our drinks we ordered the \"Kabuto\" option, which I feel should only ever be the one anyone picks. Anything below that and I don't think you'd be able to fully appreciate and grasp how much care goes into each item. There were three waitresses working that night, there was never a moment where my girlfriends water dipped below half, never a moment where my tea would go cold. They always worked collectively to top it off, while you never have to worry about where they are allowing you to keep your focus on enjoying the meal.  On to the meal, and god damn if it's not the best meal I've had. Each course is served with an explanation on what it is, where it came from, and tips on how to fully extract an experience from each dish but they make sure you're enjoying the meal however you like most. The appetizer was simple but gave you a clue to the freshness of the fish. The sashimi plate emphasizes it further. At other sushi places in Vegas, you know you're eating fish and it blurs together without much distinction other than whatever else came with the roll, but here it feels so different. Each piece of sashimi had its own flavor and texture, there was no doubt in my mind that the fish wasn't as fresh as possible. There was no trace of the \"fishy\" smell in the fish or in the air that you might pick up on at a normal sushi restaurant. When we finished, the waitress noticed we didn't use much of the wasabi and asked if it was okay in our nigiri. The next course offered cooked fish that was otherworldly. Each item on the plate had its own taste, each one completely blowing my mind that sushi could ever have such an indescribable flavor. Not to mention the presentation.  The nigiri, the star of the whole meal. In this section the chef takes over the interactions with you. You watch him prepare each piece with such confidence clueing you to the dedication to his craft. I could not help but say \"Wow,\" after every nigiri. The chef is also mindful of how much wasabi or soy sauce you want, making sure to always please. After each piece that he placed down, he will tell you what kind of fish it is and where it came from. Before when people tell me that good, fresh fish will melt in your mouth, I thought I could understand. But this truly enlightened me on what it could mean. If you go here and they have it, the silky fatty tuna and the red perch must be the ones to try.  You finish the meal with a hand roll from either the chef or his apprentice along with a miso soup with your choice of mushroom or shrimp. And then a simple dessert where you can reflect back on that mouth-watering meal. Our waitress also made talk with us, asking where we're from and what we did for work, making sure that we felt like honored guests and not just another customer.  Wow, all I can say is wow. Kabuto has easily taken the number one spot in my mind for the best restaurant I've been to. It has completely spoiled any other sushi I'll have in my life perhaps until I get the chance to enjoy some from their homeland. If you can afford it, go with the omakase along with as many a la carte nigiri as possible. If you have a fear of coming in hungry and leaving the same way, don't. Well done Kabuto!",

My favorite sushi tasters were any of the fatty tunas and the sea urchins. Nearly everything melted in my mouth with such delicious flavors mixing perfectly together.  My party ordered 50 sake, which they enjoyed, but I am not a huge sake fan. There was a lighter iced apricot sake that I really enjoyed! I am not a huge alcohol fan, so it had a light, refreshing touch.  The tasters that I didn't enjoy were the king squid, salmon roe, and crab salad. However, if you compare those to the amazing flavor that the other many dishes offered--it doesn't even matter that much.",

We have dined at the best omakase restaurants in New York, and Kabuto definitely makes our short list of top omakase in the US. Very affordably priced, fresh fish, and attentive service. We ordered the omakase without the grill option and there was plenty of food. Highlights for me included the sake appertif (I love sweet fruity drinks!), the toro, and the handroll (hands down best hand roll I've ever had). We also added on the mushroom miso soup which was tasty though nothing out of the ordinary, a bottle of unfiltered sake (delicious), and uni (most underwhelming part of the meal, would avoid the uni). Overall a fantastic and affordable spot that is worth the trip when in Vegas!",

Do make reservations and don't forget to order their special sake! The Otoro nigiri is the best you can get in Las Vegas hands down.",

For first timers, they make it seem like you are only allowed to order Omakase, 3 different price levels.  We got the most expensive one, $120 Omakase.   But you don't have to order Omakase, you can order off the sushi menu, which they give you after you order.  The quality of the fish was excellent, but my goodness, the pieces of sashimi and sushi were sooo small!  Even the handroll they give at the end, all very small pieces.  I've had sushi all over the United States, and for the price you pay here they don't give you justice with the fish.  That is why I gave it a 3 and also the fact that you don't have to order Omakase but they make it seem like that's your only option.  I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "So you've seen the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi? Well I've been regretting never having heard of Jiro when I visited Ginza. Definitely had my way with the food in Japan but still...regret. Anyway, imagine my excitement when I heard of Kabuto. And here in Las Vegas! The chefs supposedly hail from the same sushi community as Jiro. Not the same in notoriety but I bet that they take the same pride in their craft. Kabuto claims the fish is just about as fresh, if not fresher, than Jiro's and without the heftier price tag. So if you are a True lover of fish (not the AYCE-sauce-up-my-rolls kind), Kabuto is the real deal.  The place was a bit hard to find since it does not have an overhead sign. It's a small sushi bar that only seats up to 18 people so I would suggest making reservations. Ordered the omakase which at $80 a person, is a great value for the freshest fish in town. The menu varies depending on what assortment of fish is fresh that day. The bar is at table level so you can actually watch your seafood being selected and prepared. What makes this place stand out even more is that there's no clunky refrigerating system at the bar. The produce is in a case which I can only describe as a large box of fishy goodness.   The meal began with an aperitif of cold sake homemade by the head sushi chef. I was told it contains very little alcohol and is aged for a minimum of six months. There are several rotating flavors and I had peach that evening. Light and sweet, a perfect start to my meal.  Omakase also includes an appetizer, sashimi, 10 pieces of nigiri, miso soup and dessert. The  sashimi plate had 4 different types of fresh fish. Eat the light fish first and make your way to the darker meat. Each masterfully-made nigiri is meant to be eaten as soon as it is served. Everything that was set in front of me was absolutely divine but the standouts of the evening were the chu-toro (medium fatty tuna) and the anago (sea eel). Both just melt in your mouth. How do I end my already fabulous meal with a bang? Strawberry crepe. Nuff said.",

It's great to see Las Vegas supporting it.  There's not a lot to add what others have said. I love not having the glass fridge case between me and the chef. Having the fish prepared exactly as the chef wants it eaten is great. The quality of the Soy is perfect. When I go to a fine dining restaurant they don't stick salt/pepper/hot sauce and ketchup out like the local Denny's. The chef already took care of seasoning it correctly.

I did the omakase and everything was great.  I plan on just getting the nigiri courses and then just ordering additional nigiri since that's all I want the next time.  Maybe an order of toro with a side of chu-toro.    Make your reservation on Tuesday or Friday since they get their fish shipments from Tokyo on those days.",

    "text": "This ain't your typical sushi restaurant with the gluttonous AYCE handrolls and medium-fresh fish. This is the best Edomae sushi restaurant in all of Las Vegas based on food quality, value, and service.  Our Valentine's dinner (Feb. 16, 2017 as my date was working on the 14th) was the $80 Yoroi midrange omakase - chef's choice, prix fixe menu - per person, with no alcohol ordered. It consisted of an 8 course meal, with notables of the braised bluefin tuna that tasted like beef, sweet and firm mirugai sashimi, fresh ground wasabi, and bonefish miso soup.  Tips: * You can make reservations the day of during the week as they're not full. YMMV during weekends.  * They do not serve sushi rolls, so don't expect them.  * Don't rush through each course. Savor every bite as this is some of the freshest fish you'll taste, being flown in daily.  * If you're not familiar with how to eat something, ask the server. They want to help you eat edomae cuisine correctly. For example, don't drench your sushi in soy sauce, use the hot towel in the beginning to clean your hands, and it's ok to use your fingertips to eat.  * Sweets Raku is next door and great for dessert afterwards (what we did).",

    "text": "Great sushi in the desert!  Yup, you read that correctly :)  Reservations highly recommended and they only take them by phone!   With three sets of Omakase, Kabuto will surely satisfy any appetite. Specializing in edomae sushi, per their website, you will have course after course of deliciously prepared sushi set before you. Most are pre-dressed so all you need to do is consume said deliciousness. The few pieces that are not pre-sauced are served to you with dressing (mostly soy sauce) with instructions on how to best consume them :D   The three Omakase sets they offer:  NIGIRI -- aperitif sake / amuse / nigiri (10 piece) / hand roll / dessert  YOROI -- aperitif sake / amuse / sashimi (4 kinds) / grill platter (3 varieties) / nigiri (8 piece) / hand roll / miso soup / dessert   KABUTO -- aperitif sake / appetizer / sashimi platter (5 kinds) / grill platter (5 varieties) / nigiri (12 piece) / hand roll / miso soup / dessert   We chose to have the YOROI Omakase and most of it was  delicious. To start, the -APERITIF- sake (made in house) was light, refreshing, and addictive. We should've ordered extra! The -AMUSE- of squid and octopus was a perfect start to awaken our appetites. The -SASHIMI- plate was SO good. I could've had another and another and another until I exploded. Lol. The -GRILL- platter was a huge let down! The first piece of fish I had was good, but the one in the middle was a fish cake of some sort and was super dry and unappetizing. The last piece I tried had an uni sauce which was surprisingly super sweet, almost too sweet. Plus the pieces of fishbone I almost choked on was NOT appreciated. Immediately I thought to myself, 2 stars! But once I popped the -NIGIRI- pieces into my mouth, all was forgiven. Heavenly pieces of perfectly sliced fish atop a pillowy bed of rice. Heaven better include nigiri or I'm not going! Just saying ;p I do wish their rice was better seasoned though because it was sticking to the inside of my mouth. A touch more vinegar could've easily remedied this problem. -HAND ROLL- for the evening was toro and it was again, delicious. I need a new adjective. Haha. For the -MISO SOUP- portion we had a choice between mushroom or fish with bones and I chose the mushroom for obvious reasons. NO MORE FISH BONES!! Miso soup was miso soup. Couldn't detect anything special about this one. Onto -DESSERT- and we had a few choices and both ended up with the berry layered cake. I believe they were going for a mille-crepe type of cake and it DID NOT work. I only had two bites as to not waste calories consuming blah foods. Go next door for dessert if you've got a huge sweet tooth!   Debating between 3 and 4 stars, but rounding up! All the raw fish were great, but their cooked items and sushi rice need some work. Also, the pace between items could've been better. A few times we were left waiting for too long while other times the next course came much too quick. Will I be back? Heck yes and I'm hoping the pacing, rice, and fish bones carelessly left in my fish were a fluke. The quality of the raw items were outstanding and deserves another go :D",

The aperitif sake was a lemon infused low alcohol sake which was a perfect start. Very light and a perfect start to the night. The amuse was a light portion of giant clam with seaweed, okra, and other flavors (should have taken notes). It was really nice and a perfect palette cleanser. For the nigiri we got the following:  Seared fatty tuna Japanese mackerel Golden Sea Eel Baby Japanese Seabass Salmon Roe Opal Eye Sweet Omlet Bluefin Tuna Medium Fatty Tuna Diced Tuna Salmon Forgot the last one.    The tuna's were unbelievable as it just melted in your mouth. The Omlet which I've tried before in other places and didn't like was so good. Actually it was all so good. The hand roll was incredible and the dessert (from next door) was awesome. My wife got the Raspberry Sorbet which was probably the best Sorbet I've had in my life.  The staff was so awesome. I can't say enough about them. Always filling our water glass and arranging our dishes for the next portion of our meal. Our waitress was so good. She was really sweet and helped my wife out in picking our a dessert which can be difficult due to her corn allergy.  The sushi chef was really nice and watching him make the sushi was incredible.",

Besides some of what has already been said on Yelp, here are some of my highlights: - $48 Nigiri Omakase. Not gonna find this anywhere at an upscale sushi restaurant in LA, DC or NYC. Most are in the $75+ range. They also have an $80 and $120 Omakase as well. - Reservations. Reservations. Reservations. The first time my friend went, they were booked solid all weekend. It only has around 20 seats inside so you likely won't be able to walk in and get a table. - High quality sushi from trained sushi chefs. Amazing scallop, blue fin tuna, uni, mackerel etc. - Service was impeccable - Highly enjoyed that once you were done with your nigiri, you could order additional pieces of fish such as uni or blue fin tuna prior to the hand roll portion. Usually nobody wants to order more fish after dessert.  Highly recommend this place anyone looking for a authentic Japanese Omakase experience while in Las Vegas. Will be back!",

Service is impeccable, quality is unsurpassed, and the dinner-and-a-show you get to observe by sitting at the bar is more than worth the price of the meal.   I saved this spot for a special occasion and was not disappointed. We opted for the Yoroi meal and added in a few a la carte nigiri options. Each item was skillfully cut in front of us, artfully plated, and presented with a detailed description before being eaten. If you've been to Sweets Raku, it's the sushi version of the experience- upped a couple of notches.   The meal started with an incredible 8-month aged blackberry-infused sake, made in house. Sashimi came out first, then grill items, followed by nigiri. You have the option to add on any additional items you want before proceeding to dessert. The porgy, pike, and beef tataki were some of my favorites. The live scallop, fresh uni, and the ocean trout were also standouts.",

Thankfully as a party of two, we were  seated at the sushi bar in front of the chefs which provided more of an experience. Larger groups were sat at tables away from the bar. I am guessing that there were 20 seats in the whole restaurant.   The food was outstanding. We selected the $120 Kabuto (essentially 7 course meal) with pineapple sake (made in-house and aged for 8 months). The pineapple sake is the bomb! Yum!  I loved that the sushi on the menu was selected by the chefs. We tried new things and had a great time both watching the sushi being prepared and eating our way through the menu. I noticed that some reviewers indicated that they left hungry. We didn't find this to be the case. I was stuffed. All in all it was a terrific meal with high grade sushi, sake, aged soy and fresh wasabi. Everything is top notch here including the service. Would highly recommend if you are open to Edome style sushi.",

    "text": "***Kabuto definitely does not match the highs of Sushi Zo in Los Angeles or Wako in San Francisco, but it is quite good for its location and serves very authentic Japanese cuisine with several very hard to find ingredients***  Kabuto is located off The Strip in the same dining plaza as the acclaimed Japanese restaurant Raku. I prefer Kabuto due to its more minimalist decor and sushi focus. Kabuto offers an omakase, and their Kabuto omakase serves guests a variety of courses to accompany their sushi omakase.  The Kabuto omakase started with a really good lime sake, which was lightly sweet and refreshing. Next came a really good amuse course. There was very good Bluefin tuna that was marinated in soy and seaweed to give it both a salty and ocean-like flavor; it was garnished with crisp daikon and wakame. The amuse also came with tender octopus topped with julienned radish and sitting in a broth of dashi and really good and slimy seaweed I have only experienced in Japan.  Next up was their sashimi course, and this is definitely where Kabuto did not quite measure up to top Japanese sushi restaurants on the west coast. Both the yellowtail and snapper were not that moist and did not glisten like great sushi. The scallop though was very good, and I liked the Washington state oyster topped with ponzu. The raw sweet shrimp was also good, and I enjoyed the distinct nori paste to accompany the snapper.  The grilled plate followed, and I really enjoyed it. The preparations were very Japanese. The chef utilized fish choices that you would find in restaurants throughout Japan even though they did not reveal the incredible moistness and flakiness of premium fish choices like black cod found at other high-end U.S. based Japanese restaurants (like Nobu).  Several of the fish courses had great garnishes. The meaty yellowtail was topped with a bruleed miso sauce while the ocean trout was finished with a sweet and creamy uni sauce. The seared tuna was cooked too much for my taste and was topped with a soy marinated grated daikon. There was also a quite bitter snail bite and Alaskan snow crab with mushrooms.  The nigiri courses came next. Some were exceptional while others tasted lackluster compared to the best sushi you would find in the country. Still, there was mostly excellent to very good sushi here. I really liked the silky fatty tuna, which combined the more lean texture of Bluefin tuna with the richness and creaminess of toro. Also very enjoyable was the black snapper brushed with lemon and topped with sea salt and yuzu zest. The hair tail was really good and had similarities to barracuda and mackerel. There was also creamy and sweet Chilean uni and a little bowl of rice and bursting with saltiness and ocean flavor salmon roe. Other nigiri with their omakase included Bluefin tuna (good not great), marbled fatty tuna (good), kohada, and baby yellowtail. There was also a very sweet egg omelet.  I ordered several additional nigiri, and there were some True standouts. I really enjoyed the barracuda. It was nicely seared to give a slight crispiness to the outside as well as make the fish even more moist (great melting of fatty and oily fish). They had 2 additional uni offerings, and I tried both. The Hokkaido uni had a stronger ocean flavor than their omakase uni, and there was also a sweet, very creamy and delicious uni from Santa Barbara.  There was also a nice golden eel nigiri (very soft) as well as two kinds of ocean trout--the more standard piece and a rich and creamy ocean trout belly. The omakase also featured a toro hand roll and a very good though a little too hot in temperature miso soup. The omakase also came with dessert, and I opted for the strawberry crepes cake, which was satisfying though not remarkable.  Service was exceptional--very personable, professional, polished and polite. Prices on their a la carte menu are definitely high. I thought their omakase was reasonable though compared to both omakase restaurants in Los Angeles and tasting menu restaurants in Las Vegas.  Kabuto is a very good Japanese restaurant and one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Some of their fish (like their premium toro) may not match up to top sushi restaurants in the country like Nozawa Bar, Sushi Zo or Q Sushi in Los Angeles. That being said, some of their sushi is exceptional and reveals the kind of moisture and flavor that truly elevates this sushi from more standard though still good west coast sushi restaurants. With the skill in the kitchen, the excellent fish and the inclusion of hard to find Japanese ingredients, Kabuto is a restaurant not to be missed regardless of how long your stay is in Las Vegas.  Kabuto is located in a dining plaza with very limited parking. Free street parking is available.",

I was paranoid that they didn't have me down, so I called two weeks prior to check, which I'm sure they were thinking chill-out lady I have you down.    Decor is minimalist, clean, and very Japanezy.  The door is discreet with a small window opening enough to see the top of the chefs hat.  Walking in, it was super quiet, people have manners here, and conversations are low..it was our first omakase experience and I whipped into character to fit in.    We went with the $120 option.  Our first experience so we had to.  A little over the halfway point (+60 mins in) and I was feeling it.  I can't handle any more food, I'm going to explode.  The great thing about a 20 person joint is the one-on-one attention from the chefs.  They really gauge how you feel, how you react to the taste - he offered to take off a little on the rice, it helped and didn't help.  I'm so stuffed.    My favorites were the mackerel, that egg sponge cake thing, tuna of course, I couldn't even finish the miso - forget the seafood in there..I can't.  I'm sorry to be rude and I can't finish your beautiful food you presented to me.  My last serving...the dessssssert...I ATE that up!  Why when push come to shove, there's always room for dessert.   Our waitress with her pretty soft Japanese/English accent was so nice and attentive.  She took my coat in the beginning and brought it back after we paid the bill.  Such a wonderful experience.    I made two collages of every bite I took.  Divine...least favorite was the snail.  I've had snail before, but not in a non-sauce/soupy form so the texture was foreign to me.  I would definitely be back for the $80 option.",

Kabuto is located in the Chinatown district in the same plaza as Raku and next to Sweets Raku Dessert.  The restaurant can be easily missed since it doesn't have a sign.    SERVICE: Outstanding for start to finish. They will even call a taxi if you need one.   FOOD: Authentic Japanese Edomae style so don't expect any \"ROLLS\". Everything that was served was super fresh. All their fish is also flown in the same day from Japan, Boston, and Spain. We both ordered the $48 Omakase. It's comes with 1 appetizer, 10 nigiri, 1 handroll and dessert.   Sear Bluefin Tuna.  Ma-Aji. Excellent! Ma-Tai. Excellent ! Inada . Very clean and fatty!  Aoyagi( Orange Clam) This was fresh and sweet . Botan-Ebi!  Amazing!  O-Toro. Outstanding! Chu-Toro.  This was the medium fatty part of the belly.  Jabara Toro (Bellows Belly ) This is a must try!  There are no words for this one! Let's just say I got 3 orders of it at $9 a piece!   I'm definitely a huge fan of Kabuto, and can't wait to come back again !",

Sushi chefs (4.5 stars): good show and knife skills fish was presented very well.  I would definitely come here again the food service and quality is probably one of the best in vegas. Best sushi spot off the strip. Very good value for the omakase. If you want to bring someone on a date to impress them but not have it empty your pockets this is a good spot to come to.",

    "text": "This is a very unique Japanese dining experience and am grateful to have spent the hour here.   The chefs are trained in the art of preparing sushi. They offer only the best cuts of fish from Japan, Spain, Alaska, Boston, and Catalina Island (uni).  Here's the skinny: -Make a reservation! They will call you the day of to confirm. Do not be late! A center seat at the bar is where you want to be seated.  -Do not eat here if you don't enjoy raw fish. I don't eat raw fish but wanted the experience so I went with a friend and we shared a prix fixe menu at no extra charge.  -You pick from 3 prix fixe menus from $48-120 omakase. Menus may vary due to which fish are in season.  -as a part of the prix fixe menus, there is a grilled platter. Delicious! And the little crab is edible.  -They make their own plum sake which is so sweet...I can down a whole bottle of it. It's part of the aperitif.  -After you complete the course, you may order more of the items you like a la carte, ranging $3-8. I would've gotten more sake, the omelet (so sweet and eggy...like an egg custard cake), and the grilled fish, Kobe tatami...keeping in mind that I don't eat raw fish.  -Not for large groups. This isn't exactly a social gathering. It's a place to admire and taste quality fish prepared by culinary artists from Japan.   Would I return? In a heartbeat, even though I don't eat fish. But out of respect for the chefs, I probably shouldn't because it would be rude just to sit there and not eat.   Amazing. Just...amazing.",

    "text": "We were saving Kabuto for a special occasion after it opened, and then I got pregnant, so I had to wait again, and we finally just made it there last night for my bday. Let me tell you it was totally worth the wait! Best sushi I've ever had (I've never been to Japan though).  You have 3 options to choose from: nigiri ($48), $80 which also includes grilled items and sashimi, and a $115 option which I didn't really even look at. All the dinners include a sake aperitif (ours was house made orange, served over ice, and so good), amuse (3 pieces of bluefin marinated in house sauce with fresh wasabi - delish), hand roll (more bluefin, still great), & dessert (i had the melon sorbet, hubs had the layered strawberry crepe. Both were good). My husband had the $80 meal, I had the $48 and we shared. The sashimi was all excellent, but I was totally blown away by the nigiri. Each bite we were literally saying, \"this is the best fish I've ever had!\" Even the rice was a cut above! I am usually not a fan of roe, but the dish we were served was actually good, and did not taste like the ocean! My only notes on the food are that it's kinda lame to serve the little omelet and about half the items were tuna. I love quality tuna, but they might have branched out a little more. The grill items were equally amazing (beef, rockfish, and ??).   The atmosphere is very austere. About 4 tables and a simple sushi bar for 10. I wouldn't recommend coming in a group larger than 2 because you won't get to sit at the sushi bar, where you watch your own personal sushi chef cut and prepare each item.   Between our chef and two waitresses, service was excellent.  Decent sake list with about 12 bottles, all served cold.  The price is very reasonable for the quality of fish you get. If you are looking for extremely fresh, simply prepared sushi, I would recommend Kabuto to anyone. If you're looking for rolls with weird sexual names, a mayonnaise sauce, or ayce....go somewhere else!",

    "text": "Undoubtedly the best authentic sushi experience in Las Vegas - anyone who says otherwise probably hasn't been here. The decor is gorgeous and the pale blonde wood bar and interior decoration serves as a stark contrast to the strip mall outside. Don't be fooled by appearances from the outside - when you step into Kabuto, you completely forget the fact that you're in Las Vegas. Like any great sushi chef, Gen-san keeps his restaurant, work surfaces, and knives spotlessly clean. The ambience really adds to the enjoyment of the meal. As other reviews have mentioned, try to get a seat early to avoid the fish running out, and I would also add that getting a seat at the bar instead of a table is a must.  Now - on to the sushi!  We ordered the $50 omakase nigiri - figuring that the best thing to get at an Edomae sushi restaurant would be the sushi. Next time, I may opt for the expanded omakase course, but I certainly don't think you can go wrong with ordering the nigiri omakase course. We also supplemented the course with a number of ala-carte nigiri orders, to try and enjoy more of what they had to offer that night.   Some highlights from the meal:  1. Cherry sake apertif - house made, with only 2% alcohol content. Very refreshing and a nice palate cleanser.  2. Hirame - very fresh, with an incredible snappy texture to the fish. Clean flavors were a great start to the meal. The first thing I noticed was that the rice was notably warmer than I was used to, but also unfailingly delicious. Gen-san really knows his rice!  3. Chu-toro - probably my favorite piece of fish the entire meal. It had both flavor and melt-in-your mouth fattiness. Not much to say about it, but I think after having had it that I understand why it's the sushi chef's cut of choice.  4. Ikura (served in glassware) - this was mindblowing. The small spheres of salmon roe were distinct - not sticky and overly salty like you would find at inferior places. I generally dislike ikura but I couldn't get enough of this. The roe had a subtle lingering sweet taste in addition to that first hit of brininess.  5. Uni - also very high quality. Creamy and cool with the taste of the sea, this was a great example of uni.  6. Botan ebi - super fresh (it was alive until they served it to us). It had none of the fishiness and stickiness that I've come to associate with raw shrimp. The texture was appropriately springy, and it was perfectly seasoned.  9. Kamashita - the section of the tuna under the collar, the fattiness on this piece was ridiculous. The color was a rosy pink with a fine webbing of white fat throughout the fish. It was obvious as soon as we saw it that this was not your ordinary piece of tuna. Truly melt-in-your-mouth.  7. O-toro - many people would call bluefin o-toro the king of sushi, but I think it played second fiddle both to the Kamashita and the chu-toro. Then again, it could be that my palate was simply a bit tired of tuna at that point, but it simply didn't taste as good as the other tuna we had, despite the fact that it was suitably fatty and well-marbled.  8. Toro hand roll - the highlight of the hand roll was not the fish, but the rice and the seaweed. The nori was beautifully crisp, flavorful, and I honestly wish that I had bags of it to take home with me to snack on.  Kabuto was rated one of Bon Appetit's top 50 new restaurants in 2012, and it's easy to see why. The food is astounding, given that they've only been in business for a year or so, and I can easily see it getting better. I wouldn't be surprised to see it gain a Michelin star or two over the next few years. Gen-san and his staff were gracious hosts, and made me feel extremely welcome at the restaurant. His love and dedication to sushi really shows, and I'll make it a point to visit here every time I'm in Las Vegas from here on out.",

I feel the inspiration for this place but let's be honest, how does any self respecting sushi restaurant serve mediocre / tasteless Kobe Beef . The fish selection was excellent on \"paper\" - the sushi menu. The omakase was just OK. The house plum sake was delicious, as the Japanese crepe cake. The experience in between was decent.  The fact that the wait staff had to read off a cheat sheet what they were serving in a place with only 3 omakase options is a bit odd. Overall, the place is neat, meal was decent (although not that impressive for the cost). Lets face it, if one is a sushi chef taking pride in what you serve than step up and serve the finest fish instead of fish similar to any other sushi restaurant . Overall, a decent place with some good things but the \"grill\" plate is quite mediocre.  Enjoy the sake, Kampai!",

Being 100% Japanese myself and being a former foodie, what I stuff in my pie hole is incredibly important to me.  After all, that next meal could be my last.  So it better be good.  If you eat sushi regularly you MUST try Kabuto.  After dining here many times, I don't call this a meal or food; this is a dining or life experience.    Before going further let me say you should order the base $48 omakase.  The second and third tier options are significantly more expensive.  And I'm here for the fish, not the cooked stuff.  If I wanted cooked Japanese, I would've went to Raku across the parking lot.  And I have.  Some of the various single piece nigiri they serve do look similar to each other.   But the taste is so profound and unique it's hard for me to comprehend the fact that I have to go to my local sushi eatery and not have Kabuto.  If only I was a gazillionaire  I could eat this regularly; one can always dream of winning that Powerball.  Sigh.   Even their low end tuna tastes better than the local fare where I live.   I'd have to drive an hour to get something comparable.   It's out of the way so if you're there to impress your arm candy, make sure you open that Uber app or arrange a cab, BEFORE the meal ends (and check shows up).  It's not exactly a sexy or Vegas vibe to be standing in the parking lot in front of the neighboring massage joint while waiting for your ride.  And after working so hard to show your girl that you've done your homework and know the inner workings of the best Vegas has to offer, don't say I didn't warn you fellow playahs!!!",

The short answer:  Food poisoning.  But here is the whole night's thoughts.  Me and a friend came to Vegas for her birthday, which was two days prior.  She picked out a couple restaurants she wanted to go to, and found this place based off of the reviews.  We are always looking for better and better sushi, and this place seemed to fit the bill nicely.    Everyone was very nice when making reservations, and equally as nice when I called to let them know I may be a little late due to the difficulty I had getting a cab (Fight weekend...should have left much earlier I guess.) Luckily we showed up shortly after 6, not too late at all. We were promptly seated. The setting is really nice.  Very clean and pretty in it's simplicity.  It had a feel of exactly what we hoped for, an authentic high end sushi dinner.  The server was great, very eager to answer questions.  We ordered the Kabuto menu and sat eagerly waiting for the courses to start coming.  The first \"course\", a chilled sake aperitif, took a while to arrive. That would be my first issue.  I didn't keep my eye on the clock, but it felt like a good 20 minutes after we ordered before anything came out.  I understand they were doing all the prep work for our dinner during that time so things would start coming out in a properly timed fashion once they started serving, so I am not too bothered by this.  But still, I was starting to get pretty hungry.    But then the food started coming, and the timing of the service was pretty good.  Courses started coming at a good pace.  Not too fast, not too slow.   Now I have never eaten sushi outside of the U.S. so I can not speak about how authentic everything was.  I have had several omakase sushi experiences before though.  And this one, in terms of how the food tasted, was not one of the better dinners.   Most everything was good.  But that was just it...good.  The nigiri was certainly the best part.  You could tell everything was prepared well from a technical stand point.  And a few pieces of the nigiri were really quite great. But on a whole I was not blown away as I thought I was going to be.  But still it was good. That's about all I can say on the food.  From the start to the end.  Just average.  Not bad, not great.  I may have felt like I paid WAY too much for a mediocre dinner at this point, but I can accept that it just wasn't the right choice for me and not be too bothered by the price.  Until later that night/next morning.  Around 2 AM my friend started feeling like she was going to be sick.  And around 3 AM she started throwing up.  And she continued on and off until maybe 5 or 6 AM.  My friend has had food poisoning before.  She has a sensitive stomach to tainted food and it hits her quicker that it may some others.  Considering that and the fact that we only had a piece of pizza earlier that day, it was pretty obvious that Kabuto was the source of this problem.  And while she may have  sensitive stomach to food born illness, I have had HUNDREDS of sushi dinners with her over the years, at all sorts of different levels of places.  And I have NEVER seen her actually vomit from sushi before.  She went on to say this was the WORST she had felt from food poisoning.    Her experience was a 1 for sure.  I would have rated it a 3 or 4, giving a higher mark for service...like I said, they were quite nice and the technical side of the prep was good, and quick when it finally came out.  But having had to help her though the night once she fell ill, I would be more on the side of 3 stars.  So averaging the two together I came to 2 stars for this place.  And that is trying to be fair.  In all honesty, I sort of feel I should just say it was WAY too over priced for mediocre sushi and my friend got really sick from it, short and sweet, and give it 1 star.  But I am trying to give them some sort of benefit of the doubt here.    But I am not sure why.  I most certainly will NOT be going back.  Regardless of how sick my friend got...it was really pricey for the Kabuto for mediocre sushi.  I really wish I spent only $48 on the Nigiri menu and didn't go all out for the Kabuto.  Heck, if I did maybe my friend wouldn't have been sick.  Who knows what individual item or items caused the problem.  But at least on the Nigiri menu I would have saved my self $144.",

    "text": "Another gem tucked away in a relatively unassuming plaza (well, unless you're counting boisterous neighbor Raku).  Your only clue from the outside to the Tokyo zen that awaits you inside: a long thin slab of window perched just above eye level...  Inside, cool light upon a beautiful wood bar with several chefs/attendants poised yet working continuously.  A very traditional meal in a refined setting - we went with the Kabuto course, seated at the far end of the bar with a perfect view of the Edomae style attention to detail.    The cooked/grilled dishes were delicious, but getting to watch our chef select and craft the sushi and sashimi was an incredible treat.  A slight moment of panic during our sashimi course as we worried that we wouldn't get to taste everything we wanted to try (the waitress provides you with a menu of what fresh fish is available - this particular course starts as omakase, but then you are welcome to add on from the menu) - and we sampled our way through nearly all of the day's offerings.  Hokkaido uni, orange clam, a sub-specialized cut of toro... truly perfectly seasoned rice... it was amazing.  Perhaps the closest sushi/sashimi experience I've had to eating at Tsukiji in the U.S.  Added to my list of absolute must-eats when in Vegas.",

In this heat? WTF! Not only that, we were trying to get a reservation around 7 and was told that they could barely squeeze 2 of us in at 6. But when 7PM came around there were only 9 people in the restaurant! We ordered the set menu which was $80 per person with a bottle of sake. Sushi was good but still left me hungry although it was perfect portion for my girl friend. Waitress was friendly however Sushi man? Quiet. Walked out $270 less in my pocket and wasn't happy. How could they charge so much for so little?",

First the good things: Ambiance: clean and simple, good music at perfect volume Ikura - probably the best ikura I ever had. They prepare it themselves, in sake, individual eggs are crisp and firm, and not \"running\", they pop in your mouth. Strawberry cake desert was amazing. Not too sweet, great texture and flavor. Homemade sake was refreshing.  The bad: service was not as attentive price tag would suggest. Waitress had to read the descriptions from the \"cheat sheet\", tea refills were not timely. Variety of fish was not what I would expect from a high end sushi place  The ugly: cooked food, I don't get the reason for this plate at all. Especially Kobe beef, overlooked, dry, flavorless.  Chutoro was just bad, it did not look or taste fresh.   Overall, will not go back.. Not worth the price",

We are all so glad we took the chance! I'm not usually into seafood, only liking salmon, tuna and cod, but everything we had at Kabuto was terrific including: baby squid, eel, mackerel and many other things! The menu has three price fixe options and additional sushi can be ordered a la carte. The wait staff explains every dish that comes out and the wasabi is authentic which I understand is a rare treat! I'd highly recommend checking this out if you're in Vegas and looking for sushi. Just keep in mind they only have 18 seats and are open from 6-11, so plan accordingly!",

    "text": "Excellent excellent sushi! 4.5* and I wish I could give them 5 stars as I'm sure they deserve it. I got the nigiri omakase which included a fuji apple home made sake which was ok.. the sake didnt really taste like much as it had a bunch of ice in it. Also, the glass that it came in had an eggy smell that results from not drying too well in a dishwasher.   The appetizer was an octopus seaweed, cucumber salad which was great. the nigiri was great for the most part and the ANAGO and UNI were amazing. The initial couple of nigiri servings were good from a texture standpoint, but the soy that they glaze on it made the first few taste the same. Also, they served the dreaded Omlette/egg nigiri which I loathe. I'm not sure if I could have asked them to give me something else instead of the egg. I dont understand who likes that stupid lump of cold egg.   They had a couple of kinds of toro which was great and the miso was wonderful and the service was very nice and attentive as well. The hand roll was AMAZING and it literally melts in your mouth. Oh and I almost forgot the warm rice that's part of the nigiri - this is the first time I've had warm rice in my nigiri (including my dining in Tokyo) and warm rice is wonderful.  Couple of suggestions that I would give them: 1. The sushi is served fresh one after the other when you order the omakase. This makes the experience kind of rushed as I finish one piece of nigiri and they immediately give me the next to eat. I would prefer it if they gave me half of my ten pieces first and let me slowly enjoy the experience while drinking some sake and then brought out the next 5.   2. The chef tells you what you are eating, but it's hard to understand him. It would be great if you can mark off the fish that you served on the menu of the day that you provide which is disposable anyway.   3. Give me the option to exclude the omlette/egg sushi.   I'll definitely be back to try the yoroi omakase next time and hopefully ask them to incorporate the above suggestions :)",

    "text": "I had really high hopes for this place. Too bad it disappointed me. The restaurant was clearly trying to get rid of an excess of blue fin tuna from Spain. We both got the $80 pp omakase. The first course was great - fuji apple 2% sake made in-house. The 2nd course was extremely disappointing - it was blue fin tuna marinated in soy sauce but it was incredibly fishy and tasted odd. Next came the 3rd course which had 4 pieces of sashimi. Guess what was in it? Blue fin tuna from Spain (this time I think it was a fresher piece), clam (my favorite of them), a white fish from Japan, and Oyster from Seattle. Next 4th course consisted of three pieces: kobe beef wrapping radish topped with ponzu radish, cod grilled with sesame sauce, and blue fin tuna from Spain grilled. I took one bite of the tuna and was so disgusted I couldn't finish it - it was incredibly fishy. When the 5th course came, I was happier to see the ikura rice, uni, mackerel, yellowtail, and yet another blue fin tuna. Everything was alright - it wasn't the best sushi I've had. 6th course: blue fin tuna, halibut, and tamago. The best was the tamago here. Finally came the hand roll which was supposed to have toro - wished they put more green onions in here. The green tea red bean cake was good but the raspberry sorbet was too sweet for my taste. In summary, my favorites included: apple sake, clam, tamago, and green tea red bean cake. I think what bothered me and my bf the most about this place was the temperature of the fish. It was warmer than what we are used to/feel should be the right temperature for nigiri. I'll say the rice is pretty good here. Just hoping it was an off night or if the heat got to the kitchen. Even the dining area was incredibly warm and uncomfortable. Our server was very nice though. Not sure I'd say this is a must try if you're in Vegas. Depends on where you're from and what kind of sushi you've had.",

However, there was something about that rice that was unreal. I've NEVER had sushi rice that good. I know right?! This guy's reviewing the rice. The RICE. It was phenomenal.  It was my wife's birthday so we went all out and ordered the 120 something menu. I must say that all of the raw fish was excellent. The grilled items were okay at best. None of them stood out as stellar or must try items. I wasn't impressed with any of the items off of the grill but the fish is exactly how everyone raves. I can't believe how fresh some of the fish was.  Additionally, I ordered the scallop and had to wait five minutes because they were actually shucking it in the back, and when it came out, I swear I didn't know that scallops could be SO BIG. They cut off a small piece for me and it was excellent. I highly recommend the sushi. We were there towards the end of the night and a guy came in (an obvious regular) and the chef just started serving him up. I'm not sure if that's a practice for regulars or if they do that for everyone. Because I would have loved to have not done a prie fix menu and just ate fish until I exploded. I'll have to come back and find out.",

However, since we are frequent dinners at Raku next door, we have had good quality fish before and can't help but kept comparing Kabuto to Raku.  It's not as good as Raku for twice the price.  It's definitely not a big rice sushi joint.  It's a high end fine dining Japanese experience that we expected.  What made me give 2 stars was that the fish was as thin as paper that we can't even taste to appreciate.  We are willing to pay a high price for an extravagant dinner at Michelin starred restaurants, but this place gave us a plate with 2 thin pieces of fish for that price.  We felt that the price was unjustified.  We had to order a few extra dishes.  And the dishes were just the regular nigiris, not anything fancy as I was led to believe by the reviews.  We don't want to come back, and warn you to expect to leave slightly hungry.",

At first glance it would be hard to spot Kabuto, because there are no signs for it at all. The only thing you can distinguish the place is the slim window. But it is in the same plaza as Monta Ramen and Raku. Definitely take the time to reserve ahead of time if you plan to eat here, as their restaurant is small and limited. The restaurant itself is quaint, and simple. If you sit at the bar, you can watch the chefs make your sushi, they are very friendly and know what they are doing. The servers are amazing here! Highly attentive and informative. When your food came, they would explain what you were eating and its place of origin. I must also mention that all of their fish is FRESH! Fresh shipments from the shores of Japan, Korea,Brazil, and a few other places. Expect great quality! Now mind you it costs a pretty penny to dine here, so don't expect huge portions. Its more of a place to take your time and enjoy the flavor of each piece of Edomae Sushi. Another thing to note is this place serves Edomae Sushi and fish. No rolls. If you expect rolls, you're better off going to a AYCE place. The dessert is here is also delicious, its all homemade which is unbelievable. I don't beleive my words can take this place to justice, you'll have to try it out to see how great it is :)",

    "text": "This is a fish place.  If you're looking for izakaya style food or ramen you're looking at the wrong restaurant.  It's pricey, but worth it for amazing fish and beautiful culinary arts from the chefs.   We've had all the omakase menus and in my opinion, the best is to do the least expensive one and order more nigiri.  Or, just order nigiri a la carte.  The star of this restaurant is the fish so why fill my tummy with other items like miso soup and grilled items that I can get else where that are done way better (insert Raku next door).  Can I just mention how awesome the rice is too?  I've noticed that the chefs bring small batches of rice from the kitchen to the sushi bar - that's probably how they keep it so fluffy and warm and amazing.  Rice to me has always just been rice.  But here at Kabuto - the rice is in it's own league!  One time we walked in and they didn't have seats available at the bar so we had a table - I feel like that one time the rice wasn't as amazing as I normally remember it.  Maybe it's because the servers have to bring it over to us and the timing cools the rice so it just ends of tasting like normal rice?  Definitely make reservations at the bar so the rice stays amazing when you put it in your mouth.    Anyway, the salmon roe and kamashita toro are must trys in my book.  Oh, and the o toro hand roll.  But make sure to eat it right away so the seaweed stays crisp.  YUM!",

    "text": "What a life changing experience I had at Kabuto. If I could recommend a place to eat that not only has delicious food, but will totally twist your entire outlook on eating a meal, it will be here at Kabuto. My mom and I were in town and wanted to try some good fish, so I did some research and saw a huge recommendation by a Big Time food connoisseur who specifically has a passion for sushi. Couldn't go wrong with this choice, it was a done deal, I immediately called in to make a reservation. We got placed on a waiting list and luckily got the call to come in for two later that evening. They have two dinner time slots and they fill up very quickly, so you must call to reserve ahead of time. Portion size. This is not your typical sushi restaurant. There are no specialty rolls, udon, fried shrimp, bento box, edamame, etc. It is far from an \"all you can eat\" gorge fest spot too. Which totally changed my outlook on how to really enjoy your food. Slow, small (Big Time) bites, savoring the taste of the fresh fish, in a very relaxed and quiet atmosphere. This method of dining was something I've never experienced and it really makes you appreciate your food and the importance of it that we all overlook as we sometimes behave like savages, inhaling our meals so quickly without coming up for a breather. The quality of the sushi was just bursting with flavor and all my attention was fully focused on enjoying that one current piece, instead of looking to see what I will shove down next mid-chew, as if I were at an AYCE buffet. Don't get me wrong, I love AYCE sushi, but this made me see eating at a different angle and surprisingly, I enjoyed it. They serve each piece one by one as the head chef hand makes them right in front of you while his preppers support him getting everything in order. Only the head chef can hand deliver your sushi to you and when he does, he will present it with a brief description of what you will be tasting. Kabuto is a pricy establishment, but for the one time experience, it's more than worth it for the lessons/tremendous affect it had on me, my dining habits, and my many more Big Time Bites to come.",

    "text": "I wouldn't say I'm cheap, but I like to feel that I'm not just wasting my money willy nilly on unsatisfactory food, service, or experiences. What's most upsetting is when you know you could have gone somewhere else or replicated the experience at home at a lesser cost.   Having said that, I spent a bunch more money than usual on dinner at Kabuto and wasn't mad about it. In fact, I've been looking for the next opportunity that would justify visiting again.   Simply put, a meal here is an experience. I can't replicate this at home because I can't recreate the environment and presentation; and I certainly could not get my hands on the quality and array of sushi I was privileged to enjoy that night.  As first timers, we decided to go all in by ordering the highest priced omakase course because YOLO. The Kabuto set at $120 per person begins with a warm towel (something seemingly pre-requisite to all things \"baller\" in nature) and includes:  APPERTIF SAKE We were served a house-made lime sake that was beautifully crisp and clean. Though low in ABV, it was well enjoyed by the table  APPETIZER Sliced tuna with sliced radish paired with scallops in a (I think dashi if I remember correctly) broth. I started a personal rule not to eat sushi tuna anywhere not high-end so as to avoid that weird tuna wannabe that wreaks havok on one's stomach. How absolutely wonderful it was to be served this.   SASHIMI PLATTER (5 kinds) Perception altering. The sweet shrimp and scallop immediately garnered ear-to-ear grins and ooo's/ahh's when eaten.  GRILL PLATTER (5 items) Delicious. The uni-topped clam and miso-butter salmon were stars.   NIGIRI (12 pieces) This was served in two waves of 5, with a third round that was \"diner's choice\" for the last two pieces. We had a later reservation that night so missed out on being able to choose a few items due to selling out. However, I ended up having tried almost all of the menu. Oh and that O-toro! It easily earned its place as one of my two \"diner's choice\" selections.   HAND ROLL Welp, that put other hand rolls to shame. I would say I'm ruined for not-as-fancy sushi, but that's a lie. What I can say is that I appreciate the difference.   MISO SOUP We had a choice from traditional, shrimp head, and mushroom. We had a party of 3 so we tried them all. No complaints here.   DESSERT We ordered one of each choice - strawberry cheesecake, mango sorbet, and black sesame panna cotta. I preferred them in the order listed.   To this, we added a bottle of sake, which was enough to enjoy with the meal but be not get wasted and have to walk/lyft/call a friend home.   This actually comes out to a satisfying amount of food.  It's obviously not nearly as much food as an AYCE spot, but enough so that I started rallying myself to make it through to the end about halfway through the meal. The meal, by the way, is coursed perfectly so that you're never hungry or too stuffed at any given point.   The service is exceptional. Our server was warm, attentive, and personable. As already mentioned, she masterfully coursed the meal out so that we never felt rushed or unattended to. Though we had no allergies or dietary restrictions to alert her to, she overheard me joking about how my husband dislikes uni. She immediately stopped by and let my husband know that she would have the chef make alternate arrangements around uni where needed.   One should be prepared for:  - A very calm atmosphere. The room feels focused and serene. It may have had partly to do with the others' demeanor, but I felt like I was the loud, boisterous person in the room. I felt like I had to calm it down a bit. I also felt weird taking the food porn pics, but I still did it.   - A reservation. Call it in, people.   - The the nightmare that is parking in that strip mall. I'm having anxiety even typing about it. I'm also impatient and cranky behind the wheel so take this for what it's worth.   At the end of evening, with tax and tip, we paid about $160 each and, as I said, I wasn't mad about it.   #treatyoself",

For the price, the portions are good.  You get a lot of food but quality isn't mind blowing.  I've had better, more fresh sushi in other Japanese sushi places like Ootoro in Irvine or Ikko in Costa Mesa.  The freshness of Kabuto's sushi isn't spectacular, it's just only ordinary.  People who say this is the best sushi here don't eat \"good\" sushi so they don't know what is good or average.  Service is excellent and they have a good sake selection.  The wine menu is so sparse with a couple cheap bottles that bring your own wine if you plan on drinking wine.  We all left stuffed but weren't impressed with the sushi.  Nevertheless, a solid Japanese sushi place to eat at off the strip in Vegas.",

We are both picky when it comes to sushi, fresh fish, and quality food.   The service is impeccable here, our server has always been so sweet and accommodating. Even when we came in a half hour earlier than our reservation time they were nice enough to seat us. You pay for what you get here because the quality is great! Highly recommend this place and I tell everyone I know about it. We had 15-16 pieces of sushi each coursed out as we kept ordering more of what we really liked and two glasses of wine. You know it's a great meal when you feel fantastic afterward. Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "Seeing how this my first time trying a higher end omakase, I opted for the Kabuto omakase option ($120) which is 26 courses: Aperitif sake(1), appetizer(1), sashimi platter (5), grill platter (5), nigiri (12), handroll(1), miso soup (1), dessert(1), all in that order.   The food was freaking amazing, words can't describe how delicious these dishes were. They're known for their omakase, so let the chef decide what's best for you.  For those who never arrive on time like we do. I'd like to make a note that we were running a little late, so we called the host and they just told us that even if we come late, the chefs will only serve us til 8pm. This is why there are only 2 times for reservations. Think of this as if you were attending a show. If you arrive late, you might me missing out on some dishes.",

Per the recommendation of the waitress, we had several new items like trout belly, and the different varieties of toro and uni. Husband loved the kamashita-toro, which was one of the fattier options. I enjoyed having the different uni options, especially the ones that were considered \"better\" than Jiro's favorite Santa Barbara uni. Informative and nicely curated experience.",

First, the omakase includes a small selection of sashimi, and nothing impressive.  There is a cooked course, which actually was tasty for my gluten free selection, but my companions were quite unimpressed with theirs.  The nigiri was disappointing.  The cuts were very small, and the selection of fish was poor, the toro included was the cheapest--as my boss pointed out--in fact, all of the nigiri was from the least expensive section of the menu (?=less desirable?).  I will say, although that sounds petty, when i have omakase, i expect something BETTER than i would have ordered rather than less so, and here the courses were underwhelming and excluded my favorites and anything unusual.  We ordered supplemental nigiri of toros, including the silky premium and the seared and they were outstanding and it is a travesty they were not in the omakase.  We all were unimpressed in the end.  If i were to return, i would order my own nigiri and skip the omakase, but i would likely then wind up bakrupt and destitute.",

    "text": "For years, Kabuto has been lauded as one of the best off-the-Strip omakase experiences in Vegas, but I have to say that while it was good, it wasn't amazing. The restaurant was simply decorated and located in one of the worst parking plazas in all of Chinatown. Their omakase courses feature three different options in addition to a la carte. The most affordable is the nigiri for $48 featuring an aperitif sake, amuse, 10 course nigiri, hand roll, and dessert. The medium priced omakase for $80 has an additional 4 kinds of sashimi, 3 grill pieces, miso soup with 8 piece nigiri. The signature $120 kabuto omakase has an additional piece of sashimi, 5 piece grill platter, and 12 nigiri in addition to the above.  On this particular evening, we were celebrating a departing friend and opted to go for a nigiri and yoroi omakase course. We started off with the delightful aperitif sake which happened to be tangerine with 3% alcohol aged 6 months. Our amuse course consisted of a monk fish liver, served with various pickled vegetables. The sour flavors really perked up the senses of the tongue.  For the sashimi course, there was bonito with grated ginger and chives, oyster, baby Japanese sea bass with seaweed paste, and orange clam. Of the pieces, I really liked the sea bass with seaweed paste and the bonito. I wasn't a fan of the orange clam. The grilled platter consisted of braised blue fin tuna, blue crab, and seared ocean trout. I was amazed by how well done the blue fin was as I don't think I've ever had it cooked in such a way. The blue crab was light, and the ocean trout was just as good as the tuna.   As for the nigiri courses, we had ikura (salmon roe) spooned atop a small cup of rice (I love ikura with rice), sea urchin, akami (lean tuna), inada (young yellowtail), orange clam (again), and itoyori bream. The second set of nigiri had the omelette, chu-toro (medium fatty tuna), yellow grouper, mackerel, stripped pig. While I wasn't very impressed with the first set of nigiri, the second half was great, including my favorite chu-toro, and surprisingly un-fishy mackerel, and stripped pig.   The nigiri for the most part was good, but I didn't think any of the other chef's choices of akami (lean tuna), inada (young yellowtail), orange clam, or itoyori were anything special. I added on a jabara-toro (bellows belly bluefin tuna from Spain) for $9 and while it was tasty and fatty, was a bit disappointed by the stringy consistency and perhaps regretted not going for the premium silky fatty tuna for $1 more. The hand roll was toro from Tokyo with scallions.   For dessert, we each had our choice of either a cheesecake tart, mango sorbet, or green tea, and ended up getting one of each, all of which were quite tasty. The strawberry cheesecake tart was the best of the three and only available to the yoroi menu.  Overall, the meal was good, but of course I didn't leave completely full. In contrast, you're also paying a lot less at different price points of $48, $80, and $120 for these omakase versus the more expensive $165. Was it worth it at it's price point? Perhaps, but there was no wow factor.",

They take reservations 2 months in advance. They have 2 seatings a night 6pm and 8:30pm. Making a reservation was quite simple as they are very good about answering the phone. They do recommend a couple weeks for a weekend spot and a few days for a weekday spot.  When we first arrived, we were seated at the bar. The restaurant holds about 20 people, and I would recommend sitting at the bar for the full experience. There's four people working behind the counter- two main and two helpers as well as wait staff as well. I felt like there was almost a one to one ratio for service!  We had the second tier omakase- $80 which was perfect for us. They also have a $48 option with no sashimi or grilled items and a $120 option with additional sashimi, nigiri, and grilled items.  Everything on the menu was delicious and the experience was exquisite. Eating with your hands is the norm so they also give you a cloth to wipe your fingers off after. They also season everything to taste so just eat all the nigiri in one bite and it works out.  Added two additional nigiri pieces! The triangle was very unique and delicious! All their fish is extremely fresh. No complaints about anything and will definitely come back when in town!!",

    "text": "By far best sushi in Las Vegas.  They pride themselves on traditional edomae-sushi (i.e. Tokyo style, where they apply the perfect amount of sauce and wasabi for you).   Fish is extremely fresh and flown in daily from Japan, Southern California (uni), and Boston (scallops).  They have a good assortment of premium fish, and the itamae is very skilled with the knife.  The restaurant is hard as bones to locate, but that's part of the appeal.  I'd say the clientele was 75% Japanese.  It's definitely high end but not overly so for Las Vegas.  This is an omakase (chef's choice) sushi restaurant, and that makes it even better. I went with the Kabuto omakase, and here's a high-level run down of the delicacies:  - Palette cleanser -- chef's homemade sake/sorbet!  Perfect, if surprisingly ight beginning  - 5 pieces of shellfish sashimi -- highlight here was the tako, deliciously tender and they included the sucker.  Presentation was in a clam shell they had just opened  - 5 pieces of sashimi -- exotic fishes from Japan.  Two different types of medium-fatty tuna one from the belly and one near the fin that began with a K and was my favorite piece of the night (they took note of that later!)  - Grilled plate -- fantastic seared pieces of sushi, including kobe beef.  I usually sigh in disappointment during the \"cooked\" portion of an omakase but this was perfect and not too heavy  - Sushi course -- they serve edomae style so one piece at at time.  This is especially important since they use warm rice.  I tried every piece of fish left on the menu!  Pacing was especially well done and the chefs provided the right amount of information without going overboard (no pun intended!)  - Miso soup -- there are two choices, bone in fish or mushroom.  I went with the mushroom and it was some of the most delicious I have ever had.  I like ending with miso soup; this was a good sign we're talking classic omakase  -  Dessert course -- a number of options, all handmade by their \"Japanese pasty chef\".  Strawberry mil crepes and of course mochi ice cream were tempting, but I went with the apple sorbet which they topped with a touch of gold leaf.  This was refreshing and light and thus didn't make me feel too gluttonous  The itamame seems to be a good guy and he cracked some jokes with the audience.  The restaurant is extremely clean and has a zen vibe to it.  This is the perfect type of omakase for me, but if you're more of a Sushi of Gari (i.e., lots of sauces, more fusion, more cooked dishes), you might get bored.  Presentation of some of the sashimi plates could have been more artful.  My glasses were refilled adequately but a touch slow.  Otherwise, best Japanese dining experience, EASILY, in Las Vegas if not in the whole Southwest to be frank.  The mainstay is the sushi bar, but it's not overly stuck up in the sense they have tables and even a booster seat for kids.",

Looking forward to Kabuto on our next trip already. It's such an dinning experience. The staff is courteous and professional. The sushi chefs are so focused in their preparation and presentation but are more than welcome for guests to converse with the as I was informed by Ms Seiko.  Arigato Kabuto.",

    "text": "Seriously, I don't know how people can claim this place as having the best sushi in the USA. Maybe the best sushi restaurant in Las Vegas ONLY, and that's because there's not that many \"traditional\" Japanese sushi restaurants in Las Vegas in general (I wouldn't consider something like Nobu to be traditional). Another reason for the high review might be because most people that go to this restaurant are tourist from other states that lack traditional sushi restaurant.   I live in LA and been to almost all the traditional sushi restaurants. This place is not even on my top 5. For the people that really wants good sushi and is in the LA/OC area go to Shunji, Mori Sushi, Sushi Zo, Yamakase, Ohishima, Nozawa Bar, or Shunka. Any of these places are better.  Look, people need to understand that when they go to a $$$$ omakase sushi restaurant the fish that they serve you by DEFAULT should be FRESH! It is a given. If a reviewer mention that the fish is fresh at a $$$$ sushi restaurant, you might as well skip the review, because that person doesn't really know sushi.  A $$$$ sushi restaurant should be judge on the way the sushi is PREPARED! How the fish is CUT or MARINATED, or how much fresh wasabi or lemon juice was put on the fish so as to balance and bring out the flavor of the fish. Also as another reviewer mentioned, the temperature of the rice is important. The temperature of the rice should be consistent on each piece(for this place almost every other piece the temperature was different ranging from warm to cold, and keep in mind I ate every piece around the same time frame). There's many other examples.  If the chief kill a live fish in front of you and cut a slice for you to eat, BUT put too much wasabi on it, you wouldn't say omg it taste so good because it's fresh, you would complain about the wasabi throwing off the taste!  Honestly this place is not bad for Las Vegas standard and budget. To get this level of food on the strip will definitely cost you more.   Service is excellent as should a $$$$ sushi restaurant should be. That's why combine with the sushi this place earns 3 stars. I would give this place 2 star if it was located in  LA.  Last note, the chiefs here serve the sushi too quickly. I wasn't even done eating my sushi and he already has the next piece ready in his hand. The chief should pay attention to the customer and only make the next piece when the customer is done eating. I'll probably try this place again in 5 years. I personally feel the chiefs are not experience enough. All 3 chiefs looked like they are only in their early 30s. Oh they also pre-cut all the fish that was in the omakase. The only ones that's not pre-cut are the ones I order after the omakase option.",

Interesting cuts included aburi-toro, Kamashita-toro, and wakaremi.  I have no idea what the differences were, but everything sure was delicious.  And the fukko was super tasty.    The vibe, from making the reservation, to the reservation confirmation, to the actual dinner is pretty serious.  It's clear they care about getting you the best fish expertly prepared.  Definitely worth the cab ride from the strip.  They will also call a return taxi for you at the appropriate time that will be outside waiting when you finish up.",

    "text": "I don't give out 5 stars very often these days so when I do you should know that I really mean it.   Kabuto has earned their 5 stars. I could not find one single thing wrong with this exquisite dining experience. Sitting at the bar is like having your own personal sushi chef who creates all of your food one piece at a time and allows you to savor each scrumptious piece before making your next piece. The chefs are all Japanese as are all of the women staff who dote on you discreetly throughout the meal. Every piece of fish that we had was of superior quality and I felt like the chef was specifically hand choosing each selection just for us. The dinner was expensive but truly worth it. Kudos to Nelson Q. whose review of Kabuto convinced me to take my wife here for her birthday dinner.  I will mention one caveat which is crucial to getting seated for your reservation on time. They are located in a very crowded strip mall which contains many small restaurants and very limited parking. So if you want to make your 6:00 or 8:30 single seating reservation allow at least 15 - 20 minutes to find parking in the surrounding streets as the parking lot is always full.",

    "text": "Food was good but it was not \"we gotta come back,\" good. Parking is limited and reservation is a must. All the staff and Chefs were professional but I felt like everyone was walking on thin ice. Everybody there appear to be fearful of the Head Chef. No one spoke unless it was to ask if you needed anything or to explain what the dish that they just placed in front of us. I've been to a lot of Sushi places and this was the first one that everyone, Chefs and waitresses appeared to be very rigid. They were all nice but the place didn't feel welcoming; and it's not their fault, I think they were all scared of their Boss. I felt like if you ate in the wrong order or the wrong way, the Chef would refuse further service...kinda like the Soup Nazi from Seinfield. More than once I saw a disapproving shake of the head of the Head Chef when one of the waitress did something and they quickly corrected it. The only guy that talked to us was probably the youngest apprentice and the Head Chef didn't seem very please with him.  Since this place serves Omakase style, many things are not written on the menu. The type of fish may be on a menu but what they put with or on it is not. They do go over each item, but sometimes its a little hard or too fast to understand but I was afraid to ask again because I felt that if I did, I would offend the Head Chef; he didn't smile much and barely talked. I've been to several other Omakase and the Chefs were very talkative, made us feel comfortable, were more than welcome and willing to answer questions and just had fun while serving really great sushi!   In order to go back to this place... it would have to offer amazing and unique flavors. There has to be something that would make you forget how edgy everyone was.",

Thank you!) and one that is hitherto unmatched in terms of freshness, professionalism of service, and mind blowing flavor pairings.    I would try to go into detail about each delicious course, the delicacy of the decor, or the way they seamlessly match the music with the point in the courses... but i know that my words could do no justice whatsoever to what my mouth just experienced.  With that said, take a look at the pictures, which, from beginning to end will take you through a visual tour of the dinner.  Now keep in mind a few things: (1) their menu changes daily as they bring in all fish fresh every day, (2) you must make a reservation, (3) while they have a few different pricing options for different amounts of courses, be prepared to splurge... Because it is so worth it to spend the extra money.  You wont find food of this quality in your day to day life.   Finally, if i had to pick a couple favorites, the giant octopus, the Japanese uni, the black sesame ice cream, the salmon roe, and the live sweet shrimp.   Really, in every way shape and form, an unforgettable night!",

    "text": "This review is solely based on the fact that we weren't even able to try the food due to negligence on the staff's part. So here's what happened... Kabuto was one of the restaurants my husband and I were really looking forward to. Even before driving down from LA, we made a list of spots we wanted to hit up and this was at the top. So we called in advanced to make reservations specifically for Omakase at the sushi bar, I repeat, at the sushi bar. The reason is because if we are going to pay top dollar for Omakase, we want to get the full experience at the bar with the chefs. So the hostess on the phone said that the bar was full but that she can put us on the waiting list for the sushi bar and if a spot opens, she will call us back. So we agreed.   Some time passes, and to our delight, we received a call from her and she said, \"Good news! Another party has cancelled and there are two spots available at the bar for 8:30pm.\" We were very excited at this point and arrived on time. Upon arrival, we walk in, they greet us, and find our name but leads us to a table. We mention that we were told our reservation was for the bar but the lady seating us said that those seats were already reserved. And we explained that those were, in fact, our seats due to another cancellation. But she apologized and kept insisting that they were reserved for another party. We asked if they could check with the hostess that helped us on the phone but she was already off her shift. So here we were, sitting at the table, deciding if we wanted to stay or not, and we looked over at the two seats at the sushi bar, which were empty... because they were our seats. The staff looked confused and didn't know what to do. So after 10-15 minutes had passed (with our seats still empty, mind you), we decided to take our business elsewhere. Obviously, there was poor communication and negligence with reservations by the staff.    We really didn't want to give this one star but when a restaurant does not honor your reservations and fail to make up for their mistake, it leaves a bad taste (or in our case, no taste) in our mouth. We hope to give Kabuto another chance the next time we're in Vegas so that we can actually try their food and give a complete review.",

    "text": "BEST BEST BEST OMAKASE IN VEGAS!!  I have to say this is one of my first edome omakase experience and it was phenomenal & breath taking.  We obviously had to make a reservation because they DO NOT TAKE WALK-INS. This place is like a hole in the wall so it makes sense why it's by reservation only and the only way to just walk in and dine is to have someone cancel & you get lucky.  There are only two time slots that they serve which all made sense after the experince.  We were seated & got to choose the different choice courses. Our group had it so that the girls get the $80 meal and the boys got the $120 meal becuase they just eat more than us. This place literally seat like 20 people at most I think with some at the sushi bar and then a couple tables literally the size of maybe a master bedroom of a house.  The fish is imported daily & the menu changes on a daily basis but OMG the food and fish are exceptionally delicious. Everything I would never want to eat unless it is drenched in Wasabi & soy sauce tasted so delicious w/o it.   They also only provide very very very little soy sauce at a time becuase it is also an AGED soy sauce which they literally only give a couple drops of & they don't leave the cruette for you on the table like most sushi places. The Wasabi was fresh & imported from japan. The service was exceptional & the servers knew every single information about each course & item & how they were prepared.  This place also carries the world's thinest  glass for the beer that they serve.  All in all my words can't explain everything otherwise I would be writing a novel... just look at the pictures.  Also if u are looking to get FATTY full... this is not the best choice. This is more art & appreciation for actual flavors, BUT I feel the ladies may get full off of the KABUTO  selection.",

All you get is pure high quality freshest fish delivered fresh from Japan onto table without paying the astronomical prices.  If you like Americanized/Korean style sushi, don't come here.  If you are into AUTHENTIC Edomae sushi, come here.  I usually do not recommend people to try Omakase but here I highly suggest people ordering Omakase so that way you can let the chef introduce you the rare fishes from Japan.  The food itself is gorgeous.  From the cutting and display you can tell the owner have very high expectation with the overall presentation.  The food itself did not disappoint.  The proportion between sushi rice and fish were good and the rice were perfectly seasoned so it did not overpower the taste of fish.  If you have any questions with the fish on menu, feel free to ask the chef.  Reservation is highly recommended.",

    "text": "This is a hidden gem off the Las Vegas Strip - literally, hidden. Look for the address because there is no large signage indicating Kabuto, only a small light fixture next to the door with the Kabuto name indicating you have found the right place.   I have tried many top-tier sushi restaurants throughout Las Vegas, LA and Chicago. After our lengthy and elegantly crafted tasting menu, Kabuto unquestionably reigns supreme. This place could be called the Art of Japan. From what I can tell the sushi chefs honor the rules of traditional sushi/sashimi. You won't find rolls smeared with cream cheese, avacado, or mayo. The sushi and sashimi is expertly cut and paired with only a little wasabi or rice. You get to enjoy the flavors of fresh, tender fish.    The decor is as straightforward as the food. Clean lines, pale wood and a small intimate dinning rood. Reserve a seat at the sushi bar to watch what have to be a couple of the best sushi chefs in Las Vegas work their magic.   Note: If you have watched the movie \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\" I have read that Kabuto comes closest to Sukiyabashi Jiro outside of Japan. Sukiyabashi Jiro is a 10-seat, sushi-only restaurant located in a Tokyo subway station. It was the first restaurant of its kind to be awarded a three-star Michelin Guide rating. One needs to make a reservation months in advance to try Jiro's sushi.",

    "text": "If sushi knowledge were based on the amount of fish and rice that has touched my  taste buds, I'd have about 14 masters degrees by now.  They'd probably be in fields such as Muppet Engineering or Bagel Architecture, though.  Huh?  What I'm saying is, even though I've eaten a lot of fish and rice over the years, a sushi expert I am not, but I absolutely enjoyed my dining experience at Kabuto.  Both times.  In the same week.  I'm not going to say this is \"real\" sushi since I have nothing to back that up with, but I will say that this is the first Edomae style sushi I've had.  Your meal is paced much, much slower than an AYCE restaurant, with only one item being served to you at a time.  Each piece of nigiri is prepared in front of you, with the sushi chef telling you about the fish and its country of origin.  Everything being served has gone from the ocean to Kabuto's kitchen in a span of 24 hours or less.  You can start calling at 3:30pm to see what fish has been delivered for that day.  You may even be able to sweet talk them into saving specific items for you!  At Kabuto, quality is king, and it will leave a lasting impression on you.  Every piece of fish I've had since has been compared to Kabuto, and I can't see myself dropping that comparison anytime soon.  The only real solution is to get back to my sushi studies by going back to Kabuto.  This is one class that I won't mind repeating.",

    "text": "I had huge expectations for Kabuto, based on the online reviews and the recommendation of one connected Las Vegas food professional, who said his friends liked it. Plus the ramen place Monta, apparently owned by the same people, was such a revelation for me. Kabuto and Monta are in the same Las Vegas strip mall. For me, Kabuto was a disappointment. It was above average sushi. With a beer, a 10-piece nigiri sampler, a couple of extra pieces of sushi and a tip, my bill came to $84. My taste buds didn't taste sushi that rated that kind of cost. To cut directly to the point, two sushi stood out as especially fishy tasting: the jack mackerel and the shad. The jack mackerel had an especially strong sardine taste. I was eating the ginger after that one. I have to confess I'm not a veteran of high-end sushi places. Maybe this was how the jack mackerel and the shad was supposed to taste. If I'm spending a lot of money on the food (this sushi is flown in fresh daily, according to other online reviews) I'm expecting a superb experience. For me, the unpleasant tasting sushi started with the first one. It's listed on the menu as kinme or golden big eye. I assume from a Google search it's some kind of snapper. It was a mild fishy taste. Not as strong as the jack mackerel or shad. But right from the start it was an unpleasant fish taste. The sushi I liked the most were the fattier tunas plus the sweet shrimp. Both the medium fatty tuna, the chu-toro, and the premium fatty tuna, the o-toro, were delicious. The sweet shrimp and the o-toro were sushi I bought in addition to the 10-piece sampler.  I started my meal with a mango sake that was pleasant and some sort of spicy radish. I couldn't quite understand how they were pronouncing its name.  Even the sushi I liked didn't blow me away, though. Not enough to justify the price of a meal at Kabuto. The restaurant itself is beautiful. There is no sign on the exterior, just a plain wall and a window. When you get inside, the restaurant is truly beautiful. Simple, elegant and tasteful are the words that come to mind. And the service was excellent. They came through there. Again, I have to acknowledge I don't have experience at top sushi places. But I can go to places in the Bay Area that has sushi that tastes as fresh or better on my taste buds and it's a quarter of the price.",

    "text": "My birthday was topped off with my coveted reservation at Kabuto last night.  I was able to get reservations only at 8 PM, so we entered on time and were seated at the bar.  We ended up next to the GM and Lead Sommelier of Sensi, who knew both Misti Y. and Bobby Y. well, and when I got to work today, I learned my supervisor knows them as well!  It is a small world.  I ordered sparkling rose and Eric R. the moscato d'asti - we were celebrating after all!  Also, iced green tea for me and hot green tea for him.  He opted for the nigiri set and I ordered the omakase.  We spoke with our bar-mates and the chefs about our upcoming trip to Japan.  It almost makes me nervous thinking about it!  We started with the pineapple sake apertif (made in house) - went down easy and very refreshing.  Appetizer: ankimo with wakame and cucumber.  Delicious.  Next, the chef asked if I wanted my sashimi and grill courses first, and then Eric R. and I could have sushi courses at the same time.  We agreed.  I shared my sashimi with Eric R. (tuna, cherry salmon, white snapper + daikon, wakame, seaweed noodles but not kelp - I asked).  Next, grill course was grilled snapper tail, boiled mantis shrimp (purple shrimp that tasted almost like soft shell crab - amazing), and small clam sliced.  Then we began the sushi course.  We started with blue fin tuna, golden snapper, shad, king of squid, tamago, anago, and cherry salmon.  The confusion began here.  We had ordered our meals with one chef, but the other chef made the sushi course for us.  He mixed up who had nigiri set and who had omakase.  So I ended up eating Eric R.'s dinner for a time, and we realized it and felt embarrassed.  I definitely did not want to complain, but I did not want a hungry husband at the prices we paid.  We mentioned it to the chefs and Eric R. received his remaining pieces.  So they generously had given me extra nigiri on the house.  We had triangle (back of tuna, fatty), jack mackerel, ikura, uni, orange clam.  Then Eric R. ordered extra at that point: dharma snapper (because it was the last piece, it was on the house!), halfbeak (he had the last of that too haha), and black grouper, which was his favorite of those additions.  We forgot to get sweet shrimp until it was out as well.  Next, we each received negi toro handrolls.  Then I got a delicious miso soup with tiny mushrooms that had amazing flavor.  Eric R. asked for a bowl of sushi rice.  Lastly, dessert.  We ordered one strawberry layered crepe and the house made mochi, but since we don't like peanut butter we got 2 vanilla and 1 matcha.  After dessert, we received a different type of hot green tea to end the meal.  Overall, it was a unique, 2 hour experience, a very calming and special one.  It is very different than high energy, large, fast-paced AYCE joints for sure.  Every cut of fish is fresh and special for the day.  When we were served nigiri, the chef told us the name and origin of the fish.  The real wasabi was WOW!  The service was a tad slow - it was very difficult to get our non-alcoholic drinks initially and I don't like to drink too much alcohol before eating, and it was very hard to track down a server and get refills on water and tea.  The kindness of the servers and the willingness of the chefs to answer our questions and to correct the mistake in who was eating what made it a very stellar experience.  Due to the fact we will spend buku bucks in Japan for 2 weeks, I do not know if we can return to Kabuto any time soon but I highly recommend it for a special occasion.  Reservations required.",

    "text": "I've been a huge fan of Sushimon and Goyemon. Supporting patron for over 10 years! I went with a group of 8 people can left dismayed and disappointed. The ambiance was very chic, simplistic, and quiet tranquil. There were two sushi men, one who was the main guy at Sushimon then Goyemon and another Japanese guy. I was pleased to see all Japanese sushi chefs :)   We were all sat at their back table. There were also two Japanese female servers. We all ordered the Nigiri Course ($48) and were thrilled to start the  edomae sushi presentation. We were first presented with a pinapple flavored sake accompanied by  a small appetizer with fresh grated wasabi, okra, 3 cubs of lean tuna (from Spain), thin slices of cucumber and seaweed. It was good and you can taste the high quality of the tuna. The second, third, and fourth presenation was followed by an assortment of 9 pieces of nigiri. Of the assortment several pieces were delicious like the parrot fish, sweet lips, stripped pig (sounds exotic huh?!). If you have been a fan of Sushimon and Goyemon you will notice that there were many cuts of fish that you cannot find at any other sushi place. However compared to the pieces that were given at the bar, we found our pieces of fish so thin and very little rice. After the end of your nigiri dishes the server asks if you would like to purchase or order any additional fish. Keep in mind our party of 8 was divided into 2 tables. My friend and I (sitting at separate tables)  ordered the fresh sweet shrimp (so plump, lightly sweet, and tender). I repeated the order 3 separate times to the server to make sure that she understands. However,  she still had some confusion and two pieces were given to my friend at the other table. I asked the server I had also ordered one and she said it was coming out. She said that since the shrimp was large, they cut the shrimp in half and made two pieces. Well one of those pieces, turned out, was supposed to be mine. While I was waiting for my piece  (ten mins), I was getting so impatient because another couple who had entered later then us were already done.  I yelled at the server and asked her when i was getting my sweet shrimp! She said 'the other piece was yours!'..... OMG!!!! #1) if we were all given separate plates for our orders, why would you place two pieces on one plate #2) we sat at separate tables so why would they we together on one plate?! Our whole course took an unnecessary 2 1/2 hours. We were waiting almost 20 between each course, yet they were quick to take our plates :(   Okay, my review is turning into a disaster and I really didnt want to write this review because we truly do love and support Sushimon & Goyemon..... my boyfriend and I go at least once every few weeks :(   Before you go, here are some helpful tips in order to get your $48 worth  #1. Do not go in big groups (bigger than 4) because you will get sat at a table. The $48 you pay isnt just for the high quality sushi but you are buying the whole experience; like interacting with the sushi chef, seeing your fish being cut, etc.   #2. When you make reservations, ask to be sat at the sushi bar  #3. While the fish was spectacular, the pieces were so small. You will leave hungry so many stop by Monta Noodle for a snack to fill you up :)   #4. The dessert was fabulous! My boyfriend and I ordered homemade mochi ice cream (peanut butter, green tea, citrus) and strawberry crepe cake (7 layers of crepe). Highly recommend these two items!   #5. Remember this is not an AYCE place so don't expect to leave full! You are paying for the edomae sushi  experience and the fish that is flown in from Japanese.   After this whole disaster, my boyfriend and I will give this place another try. Hopefully after following our own tips, we will have a better experience! : )",

    "text": "With the name of the  restaurant taken from the word for samurai helmet, you best be wearing one if you plan on venturing into this joint asking for yum-yum sauce, orgasm sauce, or any other mayonnaise/cream cheese concoction since I will personally hunt you down with a Hattori Hanzo blade for offending the pair of Itamae (sushi chefs) preparing the most traditional edomae style sushi with fish flown in daily from the pacific coast to Spain as well as South America and Japan.    I was fortunate to invite two friends to join me to sample their omakase (chef's choice) menu and while expectations were high, they were exponentially exceeded.  If you need a primer on edomae style sushi, check out the recent documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi or Anthony Bourdain's pilgrimmage to Jiro's sushi bar in Tokyo available on youtube (keywords bourdain and jiro).  The fish is so fresh, the chef has most of them stored in a glass case available for display at the sushi bar with the slightest bit of cooling underneath and it is sliced moments before he brushes 5-year aged shoyu(soy-sauce) and dabs a streak of hand-ground wasabi in the most perfect ratio before being consumed in your mouth by hand (chopsticks may break the warm vinegar rice that beautifully complements the room-temperature fish).   I won't go into each component of the meal in detail since it varies depending on what's fresh on any given day, but the general format for their omakase ($80) is a palate cleansing aperitif (pineapple sake made in house in our case), appetizer (ours was monkfish liver AKA the \"fois gras of the sea\") 6 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of nigiri, a trio of grilled items, handroll, soup, and desserts made in house. The nigiri package is 10 distinct pieces of nigiri for $48.  To have a front row seat at the bar watching the artistry of the preparation and plating of each dish as well as the virtuosity of the chefs' knife-work is a thing of beauty.  So much can be said to the impeccable level of detail given to the dining experience including selection of fish (largest/freshest sweet shrimp I have ever tasted), personal touches (each individual piece of tamago was seared with their logo on top), and the intensity of flavors (even the peripheral players such as the pickled ginger, fresh-ground wasabi and the ice cream within their handmade mochi and might I mention the bill arrived with homemade toothpicks packaged in an origami creation and the pen used to sign the credit card was a wooden ballpoint matching the cedar wood panel of the table!) In contrast, the actual decor of the place is devoid of pretentiousness located in the Monta/Raku/Big Wong square behind an unmarked door and thin slit of a window and minimalist modern decor seating 10 at the bar and 2 tables of four so as to avoid distraction towards its stars: the chef and his ethereal creations.  Like one of my greatest omakase experiences in San Francisco, this one definitely ranks up in my top 5 and my only disclaimer is that this could potentially forever ruin one's future sushi experiences in Vegas and beyond.  If I were a samurai about to commit seppuku or hari kari, I deem this a worthy final meal.",

I especially enjoyed the Ma Aji, Jack Mackeral, Akami (Blue Fin Tuna), and the Chu Toro (medium fatty tuna)   The tamago was so damm good.  It's a masterpiece and I wish I could eat more.  We got the 10 piece nigiri dinner and ordered the wakaremi triangle which melt in your mouth.  After eating, we had a full meal at Big Wong afterwards.  They really benefit from the foot traffic from all the other Japanese eateries.  Come here for the experience - sip some sake, and take it all in and you'll have a good time.

    "text": "I have finally found a new go to place for pure sashimi/nigiri sushi here in Vegas. Kabuto definitely has what it takes to do very well in Las Vegas for pure sushi purists. Do not come here looking for an all you can eat menu or specialty rolls with interesting sauces and names. Come here if you are a sushi purist that is looking for quality, fresh fish that rivals some of the best sushi places that I have ever been in LA, SF and all over the country.  I came here with my girlfriend and another friend and was able to share their omakase menu. It was a good opportunity to try the variety that Kabuto has to offer, especially since we came within the first month of opening. I am really looking forward to going back to see how they have progressed.   Omakase menu for $80 Pineapple flavored sake aperitif Monk fish liver appetizer Sashimi selection - tuna from Spain, bonito from Japan, trout from Hokkaido Warm/cooked platter - Kobe beef tataki, grilled conch, barracuda with sea salt Sushi selection - japanese mackeral, golden big eye snapper, medium fatty tuno (toro), jack mackeral, tomago (with Kabuto branded on top), sea eel Tuna hand roll  They also have a sushi nigiri omakase for $48. I think the next time I would just order a la carte and try as many of the fresh fish that they have (typically about 20-25 pieces) that are flown in on a daily basis. The other interesting part of Kabuto is that they do not have the typical layout of most sushi places where you have a refrigerator sitting in front of you at the bar. Instead, they have a traditional japanese box of fish that is what they serve daily. Its in a glass case and if they run out, then you are out of luck for that fish that day. According to many sushi chefs that I have talked to, this is a very traditional Japanese way of serving sushi.  Overall, I will definitely go back and visit Kabuto again. As much of a sushi snob that I admit to being, Kabuto definitely is a place that I will frequent and recommend to anyone looking for fresh fish in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We had the opportunity to dine here last night. We had a party of 4 and had an 8:30 reservation. The restaurant has no signage in the front so you have to use some detective skills and peak through a little slit of a window to see what's going on inside. The interior is very minimal. There is a sushi bar which seats about 12 and 2 tables which seat 4. The person who took us here recommended coming early (when they open at 6) as fish tends to run out as we learned during our 2.5 hour meal. He also recommended to NOT bring parties bigger than 4. The experience at Kabuto is supposed to be, for a lack of a better term, slow. You're encouraged to take your time, savor each bite, taste the fish and feel the textures.  We each ordered the Omakase ($48/person). We each ordered beer and was also given a glass of mango sake (which I REALLY enjoyed). We started with a little seafood salad (squid, fish, kelp and vinaigrette). Next we had our 10 nigri (which came in groups of 3 and one in a group of 4). The chef decides which fish to serve each night. After our nigiri course, we decided to try 2 more types of fish (the Kelp Grouper and a cut of tuna called the \"Triangle\"). We were then served toro hand rolls, then dessert. We each got a different dessert (papaya sorbet, mochi ice cream, strawberry layer cake and a custard-type dessert) and shared. The fish was great, the mango sake they served with our meal was delicious, the desserts were great. I really enjoyed my dining experience.  I believe our bill came out to about $250 (for our party of 4). Keep in mind we had Omakase for 4, 2 additional nigiri per person and about 6 glasses of Asahi. This place is not cheap. Please do not come here if you're looking for an AYCE sushi place. Have some respect for the quality of fish and service this place has to offer. It is unlike any where else in Las Vegas. I truly enjoyed my experience here and I look forward to my next.",

I would recommend making a reservation at least one week in advance especially if you're thinking about dining on Saturday.  You can really taste the quality and preparation of the fish.  My favorite would be the fresh uni, sweet shrimp, and medium fatty tuna.  The grill platter was good but not great.  Still, this is the best sushi experience I had so far.",

    "text": "I came here on its \"official\" grand opening day. It was first day restaurant got alcohol license and started to serve sake. We all ordered $48 Nigiri tasting meal. It started with one shot of house pineapple sake to clean up your palate, and I got monk fish liver with okura as appetizer. Then it came with 10 courses of nigiri sushi - medium fatty tuna (chu toro), shad, jack mackerel, spring baby tai snapper, salmon roe, cherry salmon, bonito, squid, eggs (tamago), and ended with chu toro handroll.(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wWuGa3OOQJro_XGe-GKBXA?select=MR9S-geJqi2dw4DLKpAukw#8ucngOoyjJNGFLhSahQjDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wWuG...</a>) All the fish tasted soooo fresh and elegant. Nigiri was prepared perfectly with right portion of wasabi and aged soy sauce. I was told by chef most of fish were flown in daily from Japan. Blue fin tuna was flown from Spain. Claims were from east coast. And lived ama ebi (sweet shrimps) were from Santa Barbara. Everything here tasted very authentic. There was no yum yum sauce, AYCE, sushi lasania and blahhhh... It's a True edomae style sushi place for True foodies. I was seated at sushi bar. Both sushi chefs were very friendly and humorous. My mom had a good time to practice her broken Japanese (took 3 years Japanese classes in college) with them. I enjoyed the show chef put it in front of me. It really made me appreciate the sushi that was presented on my plate. I also ordered lived ama ebi on top of my tasting meal. It was the biggest ama ebi I ever had. I couldn't stop smiling after I had it. Nigiri tasting meal ends with complimentary desert. I had \"layered crepe\" with strawberry cream \"cake\". I really enjoyed the texture of layered crepe. I also tried their homemade mochi and chocolate muse. I would say strawberry crepe was the best out of three.   I felt very fortunate that we finally got a REAL EDOMAE STYLE SUSHI RESUAURANT in Vegas. Right after my meal, I tried to make another reservation with host on mother's day (1 week after). But I was told restaurant is closed every Sunday. (only day without fresh fish delivery) So I had to change to some other days. I can't wait to come back to try their omakase. It's a very small restaurant (10 seats at sushi bar and 8 seats at one big table). Reservation is strongly  recommended!!!",

For this price, you get a shot size of  homemade grape 2% grape wine.  It was yummy so we a full size bottle for $25.  Then, comes the appetizer.  Main course is 10 pieces of nigiri.  Tuna roll completes the main course.  Dessert was either a scoop of salted vanilla ice cream or sorbet.  However, the sushi was so good we ended up ordering more sushi by the piece.  Our total bill was roughly $100 per person.  This is the place to come if you want authentic Japanese sushi!",

They are in a strip mall, with no signage for their restaurant and a tiny sign by their door, but you have to be standing right in front to see it.  In any case, as you enter the restaurant, it's cleanest/most sterile sushi bar I think I have every seen.  The appearance is very simplistic with light wood sushi bar.  Sushi chefs are standing  right across from you waiting to prepare sushi iron chef style right in front of you.  No soy sauce or wasabi dish needed here.  The chefs prepare each piece with care as they brush the sauce before they place it before you to eat.  The menu is different every day and the fish they have are not like anything you've ever heard of.  In speaking with one of the chefs, he said in the 15 months they've been open, he's prepared over 400 different types of fish.  I didn't even know there are that many types of fish available for sushi!  The meal starts with an iced sake shot to clean your palate, the chefs then start the sushi presentation, the toro and chu-toro were incredible.  The meal ended with home made sorbet melon and pineapple.  Delish!",

I live in NYC, this is hands down the best sushi i've ever eaten and one of the best meals of my life.  From start to finish, everything was perfect.  The owner, chefs, and waitress were extremely warm, friendly, and eager to make small talk, they explained everything I was eating in detail, and made sure I never had to pour my own sake, a social faux pas in Japan.  Everything is flown in fresh daily. One of the best bites of food I've ever put in my mouth was the grilled goat fish, if you like black cod or sea bass you'll think this is even better!  Everything was done perfectly, the rice was body temperature, the fish was sliced in perfect proportion to the rice, the sake was perfect.  You'll eat species of fish here you won't find anywhere else.  Watch \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\" this was the experience minus Jiro's cold hard stare.",

    "text": "First time we came here it was phenomenal. Second time, not so much. Of note, our favorite item both times being the negitoro hand roll. This time we ordered one omakase ($80) and one nigiri tasting ($48). The main differences between the omakase and nigiri tasting are 6 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of grilled fish, and miso soup. Was it worth the extra $32? Certainly not. The main problem during this visit was that the serving sizes were significantly smaller than last time, ranging from 1/3 to 1/2 smaller. The first time we had 2 nigiri tastings because that was all they were offering at the time. While we weren't stuffed, our hunger was comfortably satiated. This time around we paid for more food, but both left hungry. In fact, as we left, I seriously considered stopping by Ramen Sora! The quality overall is still excellent, except for the surprisingly subpar miso soup, but they have gotten stingy with their portion sizes. Previously, while not an inexpensive night out, the price could be considered reasonable. Sadly this is no longer the case. We are not big eaters and when we pay $128, before tax/tip, for two tasting menus, we expect to at least not be still hungry at the end. We don't mind shelling out top dollar for great food, but it is difficult to justify paying these prices for what have become miniscule portions of food. In addition, the service this time was inconsistent at best. The timing between courses was highly variable as was when our glasses of water were refilled. It is heartbreaking, and we are unlikely to return.",

    "text": "Came here on whim based on a recommendation from great friends.  This is definitely the only authentic edomae sushi I have experienced in Vegas and a real gem and a great value.  Although I got the kubota omakase ($120) which included a sashimi and a grilled course, I would actually go with the nigiri omakase ($50?) and just add some nigiri next time which is the real attraction for me.    The gilled course was decent but nothing that stood out as special since most was precooked and a bit dry.  The star is the nigiri for sure.  The kamashita was a deliciously marbled piece of spanish blue fin tuna from the near the collar of the fish.  I preferred it over the o-toro, which can be a tad stringy and not as melt in your mouth as the kamashita.  Service was excellent and attentive.  I would definitively compare this experience favorably with sushi meals we have had in Tokyo and this is much cheaper than that.  I would say my only complaint was that the rice, although flavorful, was a bit too warm for my taste.  I prefer the rice to have the just above room temperature warmth so that it can just barely warm the natural fish fats, but this was just a bit too warm in my opinion.  Also, when the rice is too warm, the rice also tends to be a tad softer, which doesn't lend itself to having the texture I prefer.  Having been lucky enough to had tried a few authentic edomae sushi ya's in the US and in Japan, I would definitely stack this up very favorably with those experiences.  If you look at your other choices for complete rip-offs in Vegas such as barMasa or Nobu (we haven't been to either but the pictures and yelp reviews tells me all I need to know that those places do not even come close to the quality at Kabuto at 10x the price).  My recommendation is make a detour from the strip for this humble little sushi-ya where you can get great sushi at a very reasonable price.  Get yourself here now before the word continues to spread, because I am sure that they could be charging 50% more and people will still pack the place.",

In my visit there is a definite disconnect between the kitchen and sushi bar in terms of quality.  Upon my next visit, I may just double up on the nigiri set.",

    "text": "so this is one of the best meals of my life.  if you love sushi you need to try this place at least once.  the fish is the freshest I've ever had.  ordered the kabuto omakase which is the most expensive ($120) but you get the most. you start off with this blueberry sake which was so tasty. I'm usually not a fan of fruity alcohol but this was subtle enough for me to enjoy. makes you think happy thoughts when you drink it.  next came the sashimi then grill then the star of the show which is the nigiri.  most memorable ones - king squid (so soft and creamy which isn't expected of squid), sweet shrimp (so creamy), red seaperch (one of my favs, skin is seared so you get the smokiness as soon as it goes in your mouth followed by this delicious flavor), gyoku (sweet egg, soo good), and bellows belly (literally melts in your mouth).  service is excellent, friendly, answers any and all questions. yes it is pricey but it's worth saving up for special occasions. although, whenever you come here would be a special occasion.",

    "text": "As mentioned in the other postings below - this is not an AYCE place and is very expensive - no way around it. although there is an a la carte portion of the dinner, most of your food will come from one of 3 preset menus that the chef selects for you. However - even though I've been eating sushi for decades this was an experience unlike anything I've done before. The presentation, quality/taste, and explanations from the server(s) on the origin of the fish, what part of the body it came from, etc. made it an absolutely awesome experience. There were some choices I have never heard of and others I've seen only on rare occasions. The other items did not disappoint (miso, the kobe beef/baked course, and homemade desert(s)) but the sushi was unbelievable and the real reason to go. The \"secret\" nature of the venue (no sign, little decorations, simple colors) made it seem like we were part of an exclusive club. It is not something I'd do every weekend but for a special occasion or to enjoy with True sushi connoisseurs - it is highly recommended.",

I had the nigiri dinner and all I can say is that Nobu and Sushi Roku should be embarrassed that a hole in the wall non-strip sushi restaurant serves better quality sushi than they do. This is not AYCE btw so don't prepare to stuff your face. In fact, I could have easily eaten another full nigiri dinner. But hey, quality not quantity right? Comparing Kabuto to Sushi-Mon or Goyemon is like comparing STK to McDonalds. The servings, while small, were simply perfect. The fluke had the perfect snap. The squid was delicate and not fishy. The crab hand roll and botan ebi (sweet shrimp) are like something you'd find in Heaven if Heaven were real. I will go back here again and again. I learned that the head chef used to work in New York with Endo-San from Raku. It definitely shows. Bravo.",

As always, we specifically made reservations for the sushi bar. We arrived a few minutes early; nevertheless, they told us they could not seat us at the sushi bar. They said that they cannot guarantee reservations at the sushi bar. Huh? What is the point of making a reservation if they will not honor the reservation? We always drop $300+ when we dine at Kabuto's, and for that kind of money we expect our reservations to be honored as long as we are punctual. There are many dining options in Vegas, so we will likely not go back to Kabuto.",

Look, people forget that we are in the desert... Yet at Kobuto I had fresher fish than I've ever experienced even when in costal cities like Boston, San Fran, New York, Miami, etc.  I knew this place had their fish flown in but I was blown away when the waitress told me that a certain fish was \"ALIVE TODAY\"!!!!!!! Anyone that dogs this place is likely just unfamiliar with genuine fine dining. The cost is high but the value is higher. I mean please tell me how much should fish cost in the desert when it has been wild caught and rushed through the entire food supply chain to arrive at my plate perfectly prepared in a single day? Not to mention that some of these cuts are rare cuts from expensive fish. If you want all you can eat for 25 bucks go to Sushi Kaya... If you want a transcendent experience and can afford it come here.",

I usually hate mackerel because of its strong fishy taste, but this was good. the nigiri was chefs choice and all of it was so fresh and tasty I barely used any soy sauce. we got two more mackerel pieces and they tasted better than any I've ever had. the fish were firm but buttery; the rice seasoned and warm; the wasabi fresh but not overpowering. the best pieces were the medium fatty tuna and the premium fatty tuna hand roll. so buttery.   the meal ended with a dessert choice from four. I got the almond tofu, which is similar to the Chinese dessert. this one was topped with fresh peaches. it was perfect, smooth and light. I didnt think I'd be full from the set but I was stuffed and couldnt order from the a la carte menu.  by far the best seafood and service I've had in vegas, and the most affordable compared to sushi places on the strip, even including the cab fares.",

It was a bit difficult for us to find initially as it doesn't have much signage beyond a small light by the front door with the restaurant name emblazoned upon it, but once you walk inside, the place is simple yet tastefully decorated, clean, and warm. My wife had the Nigiri omakase set while I tried the Yoroi.  Both our meals started with a small glass of lime-infused sake.  Neither of us particularly care for sake, but Kabuto's sake was out of this world.  It was chilled with just a hint of lime and was light enough on the alcohol to serve as a nice apertiff. To sum up a long meal, I'll just say every piece of fish was absolutely fantastic.  The Yoroi meal included 8 pieces of sushimi (4 different fish) as well as some grilled items (tuna collar, beef, and sea bass).  The grilled items were good, but the sushi is what shines.  We had the pleasure of sitting at the sushi bar and were able to eat each piece of fish literally seconds after the chef had prepared it. The chefs were friendly and the service was precise, prompt, and pleasant.  They even called a cab for us after the meal. In short, we loved every minute of this dinner. The restaurant truly exemplifies the beauty of minimalism -- the decor, the preparation, the fish. We'll certainly be back during our next Vegas trip.",

Our head sushi chef says there are only a few good sushi places in vegas that offers very fresh sushi you might want to try Kabuto. When we entered Kabuto it reminded me of sushi bars in Japan. The sushi bar lined with focused master sushi chefs who welcome you with first-class treatment. I believe there were 3 omakase options. Provided is a list of their seasonal fish that chef may or may not include in our multi-course experience.  Everything from beginning to end was great, very fresh & gave my palette a rise. There were a few nigiri's I would've opted to skip but beggars can't be choosers (I just hate Uni so much) so disgusting. I would only go back for the experience but overall I still left hungry and it was very pricey. i might rather spend the money at Nobu and leave a little more full but I'm glad for a unique, high-quality, and fresh omakase experience. Definitely a must try if you love your nigiri's. Oh and service points are great:)",

The harmonic blend of perfect temperature of rice and fish will tingle your tastes buds ever so gently by the simplicity of goodness. Pre-order ahead of time to get a seat at the bar table and you'll choose one of the three Omakase course. I recommend drinking water to cleanse your taste buds, but you can have a choice to order a bottle of saki for 30 bucks. We took the first choice which was the 48 dollar Nigiri choice of a ten piece sushi meal. You can order more individual pieces which range from 4-7 bucks during the course of the meal. They'll give you a sweet icy saki shot at first and a quick appetizer. As soon as your mouth starts watering they'll serve the main course of sushi one by one, each one progressively getting better and better. Then they'll give you the dessert, a Japanese style blend of sweetness of your choosing. The presentation was very interesting due to the amount of discipline they have while preparing the sushi. It's not just a meal, it was an experience made for royalty.",

It helped that I called in for same day reservation, walked in at 9:30 pm as the last customers were leaving, and my husband and I had the whole restaurant to ourselves. We usually don't order omakase and prefer to order a-la-carte, but it's hard to pass up the $48 nigiri course for the value it offers (includes sake, appetizer, 10-12 pcs of nigiri, a negitoro handroll, & choice of dessert). We ordered a few additional nigiris and felt satiated. Next time, we'll stick to the nigiri course again and we might try their chirashi bowl.   I can't tell you what NOT to order because EVERYTHING was fantastic. I don't usually get impressed this often, but damn, all of their offerings were insanely delicious. The service was on point. We told the chef that we're fast eaters, and he just laughed and said \"no worries\". Timing was perfectly paced. And the details! I can't rave enough about the minimalist decor & all the subtleties to painstakingly create a True dining experience for its customers.   What Kabuto is: A small sushi establisment that highlights fish in their stripped down, most simplistic form. It is where you'll find sushi chefs who are proud of their craft. A True dream for nigiri purists living in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I can honestly say this is the best sushi I have had anywhere in the world. This is my ideal special occasion place. The service is fantastic and they absolutely spoil you. We have gone three or four times now and have always been seated at the sushi bar, where we watch the chefs prepare nearly every part of the meal in the most elegant, skillful way. I highly recommend any of the omakase menus (tasting menu in which the chefs pick the best of everything for you). Each omakase starts with their light homemade sake in whatever the flavor of the day is- it's very low alcohol content and incredibly refreshing. So far my favorite has been the blackberry. Depending on which option you choose, you will get a number of different opening courses, which seem to vary by the season and even by the day, depending on what's freshest and/or available. These are small plates, a few bites each, but invariably amazing and unlike anything I've had anywhere else. On our last visit there was a king crab with a ponzu sauce and some kind of seaweed I hadn't seen before, a mini chu-toro bowl (fatty tuna with sushi rice), salmon roe, and I think a couple of other small plates. Then you come to the sashimi portion of the dinner. If the \"triangle\" is available, you MUST try it, as well as the jack mackerel, the egg omelet, the bonito, and pretty much any of the tunas as they're all outstanding. It would be unusual for this experience not to turn someone into a sushi snob. They have the freshest and most delicious fish I have ever tasted and they get everything right, from the seasoning to the consistency of the rice to the amount of wasabi on each piece. The dinner portion finishes with a hand roll, and of course you can expect super crunchy nori and homemade soy sauce. Dessert has varied every time we've gone, but so far my favorite has been the strawberry mille crepe cake.  Basically if you live in Vegas and you haven't tried it, you should. And if you're just visiting, this will be BY FAR the best meal you have during your trip.",

    "text": "A client/friend treated us to omakase style sushi in San Francisco so we thought if he ever visit us in Vegas we would take him to a similar quality sushi place and show visitors we also have great omakase places in Vegas. In order to do that we need to do some research first before we embarrass ourselves in front of our guests. We follow yelpers' advice and visited this place.   Very pricey ($48) for 10 pcs of nigiri, dessert, a tiny glass of 2% sake and hand roll. The price also goes up to $80 or $120 for a full course meal per person. I ordered the $48 and my husband got the $80 meal. I have to be honest that if you are there to have your stomach filled you should order the $48. No, you're not going to feel full, but you can order extra pcs of nigiri (premium fatty tuna at $7 a pc and the price goes down to $2 for egg nigiri)   The most impressive thing we had on the menu that day was the extra pcs of kamashita fatty tuna nigiri we ordered separately. NOTE: it wasn't selected by the chef to come with our (I'll leave it to you meal\"). The chef told us there's more marble fat than the premium fatty tuna (same price), it's from the collar of the fish. Not only do they melt in your mouth but it also makes the rice taste amazingly good. Compared to the premium fatty tuna, it's a lot better. The PFT was stringy for both of us. I had to spit out the unchewable bit and my husband took the patience to chew down the stubborn string.  Next thing that left an impression is the raw giant scallop nigiri, it tasted sweet... My husband got the $80 meal but he was not impressed with it. We decided that it wold be better to go with the $48 meal next time so we can have enough money to order separate pcs. The chef are Japanese and it's hard for me to read what they're thinking because they seldom smile at first but after the 4th pc of fish our chef got less serious. But you kind of have to pay close attention to their eyes, they give you very good suggestions to what is good and fresh that day.  Makino AYCE used to be my favorite sushi place but after I had omakase style sushi it ruins Makino for me. I will still go back if I have cravings for sushi and don't have a fat wallet for sushi. Total bill at Kabuto comes out to $176 without tip. This includes us ordering a total of 6 extra pcs of nigiri that did not come with the meal. Overall if it wasn't the price, it was a very fun experience. The service was very good.",

    "text": "My wife and I found this place while in Vegas for our anniversary. After reading the rave reviews here on Yelp we decided we should give this restaurant a whirl. When we pulled into the strip center parking lot we were a little dubious but upon entering and being greeted we realized this place seemed to have something special. Very simple decor and very limited seating. I didn't count but I believe I read there are 22 seats and that seems about right. We both ordered the $140 omakase. The way they prepare everything so methodically is a pleasure to watch. Everything we had was beyond anything you will have at most any sushi restaurant. The only place we have experienced that rivaled this was of a similar style in Mexico City named Kyo Sushi Ya. Once you've had sushi at a place of this caliber it will change your expectations. We will come here anytime we are in Vegas and will recommend to everyone we run across vacationing here. Great great sushi.",

This place is authentic as you can get and coming from a big city like SF, a dingy Las Vegas strip mall is the last place I would think of for a place like this to exist.   As for the food, it's what everyone else says it is so nothing really to add here. Nigiri rice is supposed to be at 35c for those that are confused.   I'm flying there again next month to go eat there again and then fly back the next morning.",

The Kamashita was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The Ikura, which is marinated for three days in three-year-aged soy sauce, is indescribable. The Uni and Toro and Unagi were, again, incredible. The all-homemade (no dashi) fishbone miso was out of this world. Everything else was incredible, too!  I've had great sushi in Tokyo, San Francisco, and Honolulu, and this was among the best.",

    "text": "This is probably the best sushi restaurant I've been to in the U.S..... well then again, I've only had sushi in CA and NV. Anyway, the kamashita's are so delicious I dream about them at night. This restaurant is like a Jiro-style sushi restaurant for those of you who have seen the documentary. They make your sushi one by one and they already put the soy sauce on top. They have 3 levels of omakase, $48, $80, and $120. I've gotten the $80 and the $48 one. If you like cooked fish, get the $80 omakase. They give you plenty of food, cooked and raw. If you just want to eat nigiri sushi, get the $48. I usually get the $48 omakase and add-on 3-4 pieces of the \"premium\" sushi afterwards. This will make me pretty full by the end of the night and the bill usually comes out to about $75-80 + tax and tip per person.  My hubby and I also recently went to Japan to eat. The sushi here is pretty comparable to the 2 michelin-star sushi restaurant we ate at over there (Sushi Kanesaka--they win slightly because their rice is so damn good). Anyways, overall this is a very delicious, authentic sushi restaurant and worth the drive from So CA to Vegas at least once a year. When making reservation, call in 3 weeks-a month in advance and get the sushi bar seating; it makes it a completely different experience.  P.S. Their head chef recently changed as of 12/20/14 (my last visit here).",

I was really hyped to come here, since I have not been back to Japan for 3 years, I thought I can finally have authentic  Japanese food I miss so much.   I made reservation for monday,I figured they are closed on sunday so fish will be extra fresh on Monday.   Did the Nigiri course with Miso soup and extra uni nigiri.   Appritizer Bonito was fresh, seaweed and cucumber flavor was little off for me...   Nigiri course which chief explain each fish, it was truly fresh and was good quality one.  Had the best Uni here in US, their snapper like fish from japan was AMAZING...  Ikura had clean flavor....  okay so whats the 3 stars?  To me,their rice was extra soggy, maybe was jut that day?  Also their Fish miso soup, still had lots of bones they took broth from ( which fish bones make the best broth) but for the price and fanciness they should take out the bones and put a piece of a fish (even if it has lil bones, can't put all the bone in there)  Nigiri size for omakase was small... so rice and fish perfect portion was ruined, which is important in sushi restaurants.   Okay so my point is, high quality fish, if they charge as much as they do... can be ordered by anyone and any restaurants...  Only few vendors anyways... But Kabuto lacks in details... Japanese EDOMAE SUSHI should have.. small details that perfects a sushi bar... and kabuto isn't there yet...  Desert ANIN-TOFU (almond tofu) was pretty amazing, you should get that if you go there... and waitress was sweet, attention to detailed and amazing, deserving of high tip...   It was good experience, and i do recommend people who have never been to Japan or place like this try it, you will enjoy it...  Just didn't meet my expectation.. If anyone ever goto Osaka... Goto \"SANOSA\" in shinsaibashi... that to me, is real  quality and detail meet together.",

    "text": "Melt-in-your mouth toro. That's all I'm thinking about right now.  The fish quality was superb. The ahi sashimi was, however, thick and bland and not to my liking. Two of the nigiri pieces had gristle, as well as the kobe beef skewers. I do anticipate a lack of gristle when I drop $375 on a meal.  I thought the price was reasonable. We ordered the $80 pp tasting menu, which includes a sake appertif, grill, sashimi, nigiri, miso soup, and dessert.  I was full at the end and satisfied, but not blown away. I still have a special place in my heart for Yasuda in NYC, and that place is rated 572810371 stars for me. So I suppose I compare every sushi place to Yasuda's magnificence. Kabuto is similar to Yasuda - very traditional, detail-oriented, quality-focused sushi.  The service was attentive. The chef was mad when our little finger cleanin' cloths were late for the nigiri session. Alas, our cloths arrived and we could begin picking up our wee fishes. Delicious. That toro is like buttah.  Would I come back? Yes. I would get the nigiri menu only with extra toro and uni (their uni is like a friggin miracle from baby jesus).",

You are free to order additional items ala carte which I would highly encourage, particularly if they are offering o-toro or chu-toro.    The entire experience was exceptional, including the dessert made by an in house Japanese pastry chef.  They offer two seatings, and I would strongly suggest that one arrives slightly ahead of time, so one can savor the experience.",

I have been to many of the best sushi restaurants in the US and I feel that I have experienced pretty much everything that a sushi restaurant has to offer but both times that I dined at Kabuto, I had something amazingly new and fresh. Prime example is the ultra fatty tuna - not just toro but even more buttery than that. There was another piece in triangle that a fish produces only one piece?  It was amazing. I wish I brought the little printout so I can explain better but I was too excited. If you are feeling adventurous with sushi, you won't be disappointed.",

Even though this restaurant is in Chinatown, every time I visit LV I try to make a trip out here because it is that good.  I only ever get Omakase and that is the only thing I recommend that you get. Honestly, for what you get and the quality, the price is worth it. This is not a place to get rolls or more american flair sushi, only come here if you want the best Las Vegas has to offer in terms of sushi. Additionally, if there is anything you liked you can order more of at the end, of course for an extra cost.  Kabuto is located in a strip mall with a bunch of other good restaurants and it can be a little hard to locate because it is pretty nondescript especially with its tiny window. The seating is very limited so I recommend that you make a reservation ahead of time and get bar seating, its awesome watching the chefs.",

    "text": "A hidden gem among a busy shopping center filled with many restaurants (mostly Asian food) ranging from low price to high end, Kabuto shattered all expectations during my first visit.  An unmarked door paired with a thin horizontal window describes the outside along with no signage adds to the mystique of Kabuto.  Inside is simplistic with roughly 10 chairs for bar seating and three dining tables.   Since it was my birthday I decided to do the Kabuto option omakase and was not disappointed.  Dishes were elegantly prepared and the chefs chose perfectly from the visible selection of fish.  Favorites included all types of toro that was prepared including the hand roll and the giant clam was amazing until they ran out when asked for my choice of two preferred sashimi at the end.  Loved using the wasabi on each dish and eating with the hands to have the authentic tradition of Japan brought to Vegas.  Paired with a bottle of sake, the bill came out to $180 with gratuity so definitely a pricey restaurant but I would recommend the splurge!",

    "text": "* 5 / 5 stars  Wow, Kabuto is AMAZING!!! I have had a lot of great sushi in Hawai'i, NYC and Japan so my sushi standards are a bit ridiculous, but this place completely blew me away and is one of the best omakase I have EVER had in my life. For those of you visiting Vegas, resist the temptation to stay on the strip - GO HERE! It's a quick 10 min away and is better than any sushi you'll find on the strip (sans Masa).   We made reservations for 4 people on a Saturday night at 8:30pm only a few days in advance which was a miracle in itself. We ordered the $120 Kabuto omakase (their largest option), along with a small bottle of Dassai sake upon the waitress's recommendation. The omakase featured 9 courses of plates. We started with a refreshing apple-infused sake concoction to cleanse your palate. Next was a pairing of ika/tako over mozuku + katsuo sashimi with daikon. Third featured an assortment of 10 pieces of 5 kinds of sashimi. Fourth was a hot plate from the kitchen of 5 types of fish or meat dishes. The fifth/sixth/seventh courses were sushi. We had 2 plates of 5 pieces of nigiri of both beloved favorites and specialty items that were exquisitely executed. The akamutsu, murasaki uni, and kamashita toro were stand-out pieces, although to be fair, every single piece was a melt-in-you-mouth tear-inducing piece of heaven. Then, Kabuto did something that is one of the coolest features of an omakase menu I've ever experienced... we got to PICK OUR OWN last 2 pieces and there were essentially no restrictions!!! What a novel idea - I can't believe more places don't do this. I was also just extremely impressed by the variety and quality of the fish selection. I chose to have another piece of the murasaki uni and I tried the aburi toro which was incredible. Finally, we ended the sushi courses with a negi toro handroll. Our eight course was  a generous portion of miso soup, and we had the option of choosing shrimp or fish (I chose the shrimp). Finally, as if I wasn't already full 5 courses ago, we ended the meal with dessert of our choice. I picked the sesame flan which had an incredible aroma and taste to it.   I cannot say enough good things about Kabuto, there are simply no words to express. Put as concisely as possible, the price/value here is the best I've ever seen. The $120 omakase was almost too much food, and I actually think I'll get the smaller omakase next time because my stomach just couldn't fit all the food in it. Everything is extremely fresh, the selection is out of this world, and the portions are the most generous I've seen.   The restaurant is minimalist, casual, clean, quiet and plays beautiful Japanese traditional music in the background. One of my biggest pet peeves is when authentic Japanese sushi bars are playing some random hip hop or top 40 playlist. And, finally, of course the service was IMPECCABLE.   This is my new favorite sushi restaurant. I wish I lived in Vegas.",

    "text": "Amazing sushi place. It is not even about freshness of the fish (I expect it to be fresh at any high end sushi place), but it is about the execution. The amount of wasabi and sauce chef puts on each creation turns a regular piece of sushi into something exceptional.   We went to a very similar restaurant in Osaka, Japan which we loved a lot, but this one was even better! Considering Las Vegas is way closer to us than Japan, it is a very convenient option.  If you expect big portions or regular variety of rolls you can find at any other sushi place, please do not come here, you will be disappointed. Also, if you are a chatty type who likes to interact with chefs while they are making your pieces maybe this is not the best option for you either. If you are looking for salmon, most likely you wont see it on the menu, but they carry ocean trout which is similar to salmon in appearance and taste, just a little bit more refined.  Make a reservation to secure a spot, the restaurant is very small. Don't be late, they hold your reservation only for 15 minutes. Tell a cab driver to go to a plaza where Raku restaurant is located, they all know Raku, but Kabuto is too small.  After visiting this restaurant we made a second reservation, but unfortunately missed it due to personal circumstances. We would love to come back here next time we are in LV!",

We order the $80 Omakase menu and yes, like everyone has mentioned, this is the best and most fresh seafood in town.   It starts off with homemade sake, and then a series of small plates with a couple of tastes on each plate. For me this menu was more than enough food.   The stand out menu items were the uni, tamago, scallop, rectangular tuna hand roll, and strawberry crepe dessert.   There was a plate with some cooked items, among them was a skewer of kobe beef  but it was overcooked.   Other than the beef, everything was great and I would definitely come back for the fresh uni (even though I don't normally eat that!)",

From beginning to the end the server was attentive that every course was well timed. We ordered the nigiri course for $48 and sashimi $28 with some a la carte nigiri. The Asahi draft is a very nice touch with extremely thin/light beer glass. The chef served the nigiri to us one at a time at the sushi bar. Every piece of them looks like a piece of art, I almost feel like I should just admire it. Each one tastes so fresh and the toros just melt in your mouth. The fish to rice ratio is perfect and everything goes together in harmony. The fish miso soup is probably the best I've had as well.  All in all, I can't describe everything I feel but I can say wholeheartedly that I am grateful to the chef and server for this meal.",

Eating here is a very serious food experience in some ways. The chef doesn't talk and the service is incredibly detailed oriented. The location is nice inside but easy to miss on the outside if you don't know what you're looking for. Cost wise, it is in line with other high end sushi experiences I have had and certainly was worth every penny. Would definitely recommend coming here. I suggest the middle omakase order if you don't have a big appetite or would like to order ala carte after the meal. The most expensive omakase option did include courses that were only available through that tier of omakase.  Protip: I made a reservation for right when they opened, but you could reasonably walk into the restaurant at 730pm or after and get a great seat for multiple people.",

I deal with Tokyo Kyoto and Osaka restaurants every day and some of the best in the world. This type of Edomae Service and cuisine is what you would expect from a place like Sushi Saito or Sushi Yoshiitake all the way in Tokyo.   I went with a friend that has been to Kabuto before and she advised me to go with the lowest tasting menu that way we could sample and order more and not break the bank. I am very excited to go back here and taste more of what they have to offer. Especially now that the fish markets have changed in Tokyo where they get most of their fish from.",

But as we sat down and got the Kabuto menu with sake pairing (~$300 each), when first course arrived- nobody talks about work anymore, without even a consensus. Food was magic. Our minds went into another zone and we were all relaxed and euphoric afterwards. It's like taking a warm bath. Not many restaurants can do that. It was a life changing experience somehow, or perhaps we were just over-stressed. Needless to say, I will gladly come back the next time I'm in Vegas.  The best food experiences in Vegas are outside of the strip.",

They start the meal off with some mixed sake drink that is sweet. Unfortunately we did not get to sit at the counter, but they presented the sushi very uniformly. The star of the show was obviously the nigiri, every piece was delicious in its own way (even the bonito that I usually find overly fishy). They had the right balance of flavors and real wasabi (yes you read that right, they use real wasabi at this price point). If I had to say what stood out, the trout and clam would be my picks.  Meal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 10 At it's price point, one would say this is the best value you'll ever get for sushi anywhere in the United States. No frills, authentic sushi, traditional Japanese ambiance. Be here else you're missing out on an experience of a lifetime.",

I have dined out all over the country and my business partner and I often debate what meal would rank in our top 10.  Every time that debate happens, Kabuto always seems to rise to the top.  My wife and I and another couple go each year on an annual trip to Vegas.  There is no doubt that it is my most anticipated meal of the year.    If you are a sushi lover - especially one that appreciates simple well dressed nigiri over americanized rolls - you can't beat Kabuto.  To get the full experience, snag a reservation at the sushi bar where you must order the Omakase.  Then add as many a la carte nigiri pieces as you can handle.  You will go home full and satisfied.  Of all the places I've eaten, Kabuto is my personal favorite for Best Meal Ever.",

Kabuto is a very traditional Edomae style restaurant. It's normally booked up months in advance so I recommend making your reservation ahead of your trip. I came with a friend and I chose the $120  Kabuto omakase and my friend chose the $80 Yoroi.My Kabuto Omakase included: aperitif sake'/appetizer/sashimi (5 kinds of sashimi 10pc in total)/ Nigiri 12pc/ hand roll / miso soup/ dessert! And this price you would never find in Austin Tx at any of the Omakase places! And your getting a True Edomae style experience! This place is really small it seats 10 at the sushi bar and 4 tables that set 4 each! They have 4 Japanese sushi chefs and Japanese waiters! So if your Japanese as I am you will have no problem communicating with the chefs! I highly recommend this restaurant for \"True sushi eaters\" The fish is very fresh! And it's prepared correctly! You will not get \"Truffle\"or \"strawberry's\" on top of your Nigiri here! Or your sashimi floating in yuzu!! (Im talking to you Austin wannabe sushi snobs) and you definitely won't find any \"Roles\" topped with spicy saracha and mayonnaise!!  Please come try this place when your in Vegas!!!! I definitely will be back!",

The chef very knowledgeable ofcourse and guided us through the entire courses. Everything we had was imported over sea.  At the very end of it they made  a birthday cake for my special date. If your into high quality sushi definitely a must try!",

My two other friends and I came here on a Saturday night and ordered the Omakase ($50 for 10 pc). We were served star snapper, striped pig, salmon roe, premium fatty tuna, hokkaido scallop, yellow tail and a few other nigiri pieces I am missing. The fish variety here ranges from the fatty slices that melt in your mouth to the tougher but still fresh slices. Regardless the type of fish you get, each piece is delectably prepared to delight your taste buds.   The service here is also superb - the waiters/waitresses are constantly checking in on you, filling your glass and ensure you feel satisfied.",

They served the draft beer in a plastic beer glass. I know that sounds like a Oxymoron but it was ment to look like a glass.  3. They started scrubbing the floors getting ready to close while people were still eating and being served.  (At $125 a person that seems kinda tacky)",

I also like the atmosphere and decorations. You definitely need to make reservations in advance. I think they only sit twice a day. I recommend to sit at the sushi bar. So the chef can make sushi in front of you and you can eat it after they make each sushi. It's more fresh. If you sit at the regular table. I think they make all the nigiri and serve together. I don't really like sweet shrimp normally, but I love this restaurant used to have clear meat and chewy sweet shrimp before( I guess probably it's live shrimp). However this time the sweet shrimp is not live one, so it tastes not as good as before, but still better than other place. You can ask they put the shrimp head to your miso soup. Their iced fruit sake they made in house is pretty good and refresh. Overall, I think this price for this kind of quality is not bad. Definitely will come back!",

    "text": "Honestly, this was just ok for us and we are huge sushi and Japanese food fans.  We had an amazing meal at neighboring Raku so our hopes were high.  Kabuto just didn't live up to expectations.  The fish was very fresh but for the price (husband ordered the $80 omikase and I ordered the $120 omikase), the portions were extremely small.  I am a small girl and a fairly light eater and I left with hunger pangs!  And it wasn't like I could order more food, we sat down at 6 and had to be out by 8.  My husband and I eat lightening fast but you can only eat as fast as the server/chef sends out the food which in our case was extremely slow. By 7:50 we were being rushed out having just swallowed our last bite.  And dessert was a big let down so leaving on that note was a bummer.  I have a sweet tooth the size of the State of Nevada and the custards and ice creams they brought were hardly sufficient to satisfy it.    Also, if you are deciding between the $80 and $120 omikase, go with the $80.  The  offerings for the \"kabuto\" $80 Omikase were perfectly fine and didn't seem like a $40 less value than the more expensive alternative.    Finally, don't go expecting fair prices on alcohol.  Raku had a huge selection of wines and sake and fair prices on beer.  Kabuto charged $6 for a teeny tiny beer and the cheapest and only glass of red wine was $15 while the cheapest sake was similarly priced.  I had two drinks and paid almost $50!  I definitely wouldn't go back.  If in the area, check out Raku instead.",

This place is perfect for a Date Night or a small girls night out. DEFINITELY order the Omakase. O-toro and Chu-toro are litterally MELT IN YOUR MOUTH so good! So was their Uni and Ikura and before having those there I NEVER liked Uni or Ikura. That's how you know its GOOD! I wish I could remember everything they brought out because it was all amazing! This is a traditional sushi place so do not expect to order a Las Vegas Roll with screaming orgasm sauce lol. Sushi Chefs are very tradiotional, super friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Great customer service. Hands down MY FAVORITE sushi spot. Too bad it is on the higher price range because I would LOVE to eat here on a regular basis.

Everything I put in my mouth was in the neighborhood of a \"9\", some better, only two things that I thought were less... but they just kept bringing more and it didn't matter. I ordered a sake recommendation from the waitress and loved it. The ambiance of the place captivated me. Soft lighting in a zen-sparse room.

    "text": "Seriously one of the best sushi experiences I've had in the states. Getcha Jiro on here! The food here is top notch, authentic, and the entire experience is like that of a high-end sushi restaurant in Japan.   The waitstaff was extremely knowledgeable about every aspect of the food. Ask them about their sake recommendations. They are so sweet, are not too intrusive, and even called a cab for us at the end of our meal.  The food itself is amazing and really beyond the scope of my food vocabulary to describe. If you need authentic sushi (flown in from Japan), with melt-in-your-mouth fish and a curated selection and order of dishes, and none of that Americanized, mayo-ridden, /r/sushiabomination material, get yourself on to Kabuto.  The website makes it seem like it's omakase only, but you can get sushi a la carte! I'm guessing that since the menu changes so often, it's difficult to update online. They gave us a paper menu of their current nigiri selection to choose from. If you like tuna, this is the place for you--just beware of the black box warning of tuna at the top that may be hard on your wallet, but so good while it's in your mouth.  I had been wanting to go to Kabuto for years, and this did not disappoint.",

I've been lucky enough to try sashimi in some wonderful places, but Kabuto is one of the most underrated experiences you can have, especially in a town of incredible eats like Vegas.   My best friend brought me here last fall for a \"girls' weekend\" splurge meal, and it was so good I promptly brought my husband and HIS best friend back here the following month. For $80, the mid-range omakase had all of us - from picky eaters to supersize-me-quantity-loving eaters - pretty full. The 10-or-so courses are small, delicate, expertly prepared, and artistically presented. The in-house-made aperitifs change regularly and are very delicate. Getting to sit at the bar is a real treat as well, since the chefs' craftsmanship and passion for food is visible in every prep step.   My favorites are the sashimi - impossibly rich and fresh - the roe, served in a little shot glass - and the tiny deep fried whole crab.  Menus change regularly, so come back often and try new things. :)",

We even changed the reservation from 3 to 4 people on December 20 and everything looks fine at that time. However, we were told the reservation has been canceled the night that we arrived in the restaurant, because the server told us that she called us on December 21 to confirm the reservation but nobody answer the phone, so it automatically canceled. The friend who helped us made the reservation missed the phone call was due to her absence in U.S, but I still feel ridiculous to be treated as this. I made hundreds of reservation in different restaurant in both US and Canada, but never experienced a reservation policy like this. We even changed the # of people on December 20 for Dec. 22's reservation, so what's the point that I won't show up even I missed the call that they made on Dec 21. I feel extremely offensive and left after that. Maybe the food in the restaurant is good, but I will definitely not go there even I've been to Vegas again. I highly doubt that they accidentally gave our reservation to the wrong people so then had to find a decent reason to let us go because my other friends went there on December 26 and they said nobody calls them for reservation confirm the day before. I don't know if the food is good as others promoted, but if you want to experience those stupid ridiculous services and policies, please go ahead. There are a lot of good sushi places in both US and Canada, and I don't know what made you guys think you are so unique then treat customer like this.",

The waitress greeted us promptly and asked if we had reservations.  We said no, and she smiled and said it's your lucky day, we're not too busy.  She sat us down at the only table available next to two other tables that were occupied right behind the sushi bar.  If I were to imagine what a real sushi restaurant in Japan looks and feels like; I would imagine a place just like Kabuto.  The decor was simple, yet relaxing.  The small surrounding and easy flow of everything made it feel homey.  Since we raged the night and afternoon before arriving, we were pretty out of it.  So the ambiance was quite comforting.   We tried the omakase.  The sushi, sashimi, soup, dessert and many of the other items that came out were exquisite.  No wonder why people rate this place so highly.  My apologies for not remembering our entire dinner course, by course.  But there's no need to run it down, since omakase menus change all the time.  I am sure whatever is on the menu for omakase, you will be satisfied.  Overall a great experience and a welcomed change in pace while visiting the City of Sin...    Parking Tip: Crowded parking lot, as there are other seemingly popular restaurants in the same plaza.  If you're staying on the strip, just cab it.  Location:  Not too far from the strip; the actual restaurant is hard to find since they really don't have a huge sign",

I wanted to take him for his birthday last year but with a newborn it was just nearly impossible. Fast forward to a year later and I finally kept my promise. I made a reservation like everyone had recommended and let's just say I left happy and full.   Now it's been almost a month since I've been but I remember everything about it and I even have mommy brain now. When you first walk in (and we were the first of the night) all the chefs greet you as well as the servers. After looking at the menu, we decided to get the yoroi. The chefs were nice enough to ask if we didn't like anything but we wanted everything!   The verdict...oh yea...definitely one of the best fishies in town in my belly. We did order 4 extra pieces of nigri on top of our yoroi menu but like I said we left full and satisfied. My favorite was probably the tuna fin. I forgot what the chef called it but it was better than some of the \"toro\" that I've eaten.   Service was excellent. I've never had my dishes cleared so quickly and efficiently. Loved everything about this place! It's pricey but totally worth it!",

The next day I got the call and was able to be seated along the sushi bar with my girlfriend at around 7pm. The restaurant is tiny and easy to miss as it's in a strip mall that seems rundown but is actually the scene of a food renaissance housing many amazing eateries (Raku, Monta, Hwaro, and of course Kabuto).   We decided to go with the $50 omakase to get a feel of the menu and to taste just how fresh the fish is which is supposedly flown in daily from Spain and Japan. This is something mostly done by high end restaurants with many Forbes stars along the strip. It's Vegas everything gets flown in.   Omakase: Appetizer Sake. Amuse. 10 pc Nigiri, Handroll, and Dessert. There's also an option to add more before your meal and right before the handroll. The experience was a delight as after the sake and amuse the Chef assigned to you will ask for permission to being serving you. (The Japanese culture is very evident which results in very polite staff) Every piece is handmade and the Chef throws in a variety of different items that take you on a carefully selected but wild ride. (But don't worry if there's anything you're not comfortable eating you can let them know before hand as there is a dish with fish sperm) The taste of everything is very clean and fresh. Which is how real Japanese sushi should be enjoyed. Nothing is overpowering and the quality and cut of the fish is what makes the boldest statement. My favorite dish was something that I selected afterwards which was I believe a seared fatty tuna. It absolutely melted in my mouth and I felt like I was eating A5 Wagyu beef. The quality bought me back to Tokyo and the various sushi restaurants I've dine in. This is as authentic as it gets and is definitely something that should be tried by sushi enthusiasts. Although the portions are small it's an experience that's raw, intimate, and it forces you to really taste the sushi as opposed to stuffing as much nigiri and rolls you can into your mouth in an Ayce setting which definitely has it's time and place.    Thoughts: For the price of this experience to only start at $50 is an absolute steal. Go anywhere on the strip for the same thing such as at Morimoto or Zuma and you'll find yourself paying double. For something similar if not barely matching up to the standard of excellence at Kabuto. The chef's have honed their craft for years and you can tell in the precision and care they put into making their cuts. It's something that can only be achieved through thousands of hours of practice. The knives they use and care they put into them reflects that as well. These aren't your regular sushi knives as they range from the upwards of thousands of dollars. Our chef seemed cold at first but after finishing up our experience he began to small talk and was a really chill dude. This again shows that they put alot of effort into their craft and although it may seem intimidating at first you get used to it and find yourself enjoying the detail and attention being put into your food. Kabuto is definitely a steal and I'm afraid that it may not be the case for long but hopefully it is as I plan to return for the Yoroi or Kabuto.",

Rice, cut, temperature of fish, presentation, service, everything is perfect. I honestly do not know, or believe I have the qualification to say how they could improve.  Aside from the fact they're located in an odd strip-mall in china town. But honestly, I consider that a feature; that you have to go out of your way to eat here. I don't want the unwashed masses of the strip coming here. It's small, it's focused, and for me it's perfect.",

    "text": "Such a beautiful culinary experience! We snagged a last-minute reservation for a Thursday night. The restaurant is on the same block as Raku but the ambience here is bright and cheery. We sat at the bar and ordered two omakase plus a few a la carte nigiris. All the staff are Japanese and very friendly.   Like other Yelpers, I recommend going with the first omakase because you get 10 nigiris, more so than the next tier up. The nigiris here are the best I've ever had, with the perfect combination of bite-size fresh fish and warm sushi rice. Our sushi chef wouldn't make the next nigiri until we finish the one on our plate, just so he can ensure everything stays super fresh. A lot of care also went into the condiments: the imported wasabi added a bit of sweetness to the fish, and the ginger was tangy and fresh.  Everything was designed to complement each other and I was hard pressed to find any flaws at all with this amazing experience.",

    "text": "I had the distinct pleasure of eating at Kabuto on a Friday night.  They do two seating's a night.  I think one is at 6pm and the second is at 8pm.  They setting is very inmate and small.  I'd describe it as somber and quite inside.  You're essentially assigned server who brings you anything you need, and explains every piece of fish that is placed in front of you.  It's actually a lot of information presented to you, but it's not over the top.  The chefs are more on the elitist side, and don't talk too much.  I heard some folks bragging about their Tokyo experience's and they looked unimpressed.  Which I thought was funny.  Like the servers, you're pretty much assigned a chef as well.    The fish was great. Don't expect every piece to melt in your mouth.  I like the dynamic of eating unique fish that is hard to get, or specific to certain regions of the world.  So while they may all not taste like blue fin toro.  Make no mistake that little expensive piece of sushi is special and hard to find.  I really enjoy the experience and would probably visit once a year.  Kabuto is a special restaurant and the create a special experience.",

    "text": "So this omakase spot in Vegas has been on my bookmarks for awhile. Finally got to try it and I wasn't very impressed. I found it to be very basic sushi - nothing wowed me. Here's the breakdown:  There's a $48, $80, and $120 omakase. If you're still hungry then they have a menu that you can order from al la carte. I noticed that all the good, \"premium\" items ie the toro, bellows belly, etc were not given in my $80 omakase. Instead, basic sushi was given to me like amberjack, bluefin tuna, etc. I peered over at the table next to me who got the $120 omakase and it didn't look very impressive either.   Sooo what I recommend doing to \"cheat the system\" is to order the cheapest $48 omakase and then order the good stuff a la carte!!! Cuz you can't just go in and order a la carte right off the bat since it's an omakase spot. You're welcome!!!",

I would call ahead for a reservation, the place was full when we visited. They offer 3 omakase courses. We ordered the Nigiri course and the Kabuto course. The grilled dishes and sashimi were great but I would definitely focus on the sushi. After our course was over, we ordered about 12 more pieces a la carte. The live sweet shrimp, marbled tuna, premium silky fatty tuna, and sand borer were my favorites but all pieces were great. Ishi was our sushi chef, and he was attentive and friendly for the entire meal. Thanks again!",

    "text": "Making my nigiri omakase rounds and today's stop was at Kabuto in Las Vegas. Tucked in a small strip mall with shops and lots of restaurants on 3 sides, the parking lot can get pretty crowded at 6PM so a good tip is to arrive 20 min early and scope some of the other restaurants or get a boba at kung fu tea!  The omakase started with a very light lemon sake on ice to whet my palate and actually made me consider getting a bottle of it.   The appetizer had a baby squid and some very interesting textured seafood.  Not my favorite.    However, soon the nigiri started and all was good. The lean tuna was firm, moist and tasted like the sea. A great start.  The Hokkaido scallop had a texture that showed it was fresh and super sweet.  My favorite. The deep sea porgy was in the mackerel family and this was my first experience with it.  Definitely a winner!    Sweet shrimp was large, great texture and True to its name.  They don't serve the heads automatically, maybe if we had asked but we didn't.   Also got to try mejina (opal eye) and sayori (halfbeak) both are white fish and very nice.   The Uni sampler was a great way to compare multiple types from California and Japan. Definitely liked the Santa Barbara over the Catalina on this day.  Both Japanese Uni were lovely to look at but the natural was the best of the four.   Overall, great value and freshness that compared favorably to Southern California.  Definitely much better value than anything near or on the strip.   Service was friendly and attentive. Rating is well deserved.",

The service was prompt and friendly, the food was delicious, the drinks were plentiful, and the ambiance was warm and inviting.  I strongly recommend doing the sake pairing with the Kabuto omakase.  You're going to pay more money but it's definitely worth the extra cost to drink some amazing (new) sake and additionally prepared special food.",

The prices are steep (pri fixe options of $48, $80, and $120), but you get what you pay for (fresh fish, an intimate setting, and phenomenal service).     The menu is limited to pri fixe options, which only vary on how many dishes you want.  However, regardless of how many dishes you order, the chefs make sure you leave fully satisfied!  The atmosphere is intimate and the close proximity to the chefs allows you to fully appreciate the art of preparing sashimi.  I really enjoyed watching the chefs cut the fish and prepare each dish.  Eating at Kabuto is not an every-day experience, but it is great for special occasions or a memorable meal.  My wife and I enjoyed our first post-wedding dinner date at Kabuto.",

But both times were the same or even better. Consistency is the best thing you can have at a restaurant and at this place, every worker up holds to that.   Here, the sushi chef can serve you by course and is very knowledgeable of what part of the fish he's serving and from where it comes from. And what I mean by the chef serves you, is that he delicately cuts the fish and makes it into a nigiri, handroll, or sashimi. It's amazing to watch right before your eyes. (RSVP at the bar, it's worth it!)  There are servers who are very attentive as well. Always refilling our sake or beer as we go. They are also very knowledgeable, soft spoken, and always serving with a smile.   As for quality, everything is fresh and not drowned in sauces like AYCE. You can taste the different types of fishes and the textures. Delicious!  For the sushi lovers, I highly recommend the Edomae experience at Kabuto!",

Call in advance and get a seat at the counter to watch them create your masterpiece!  To preface, I live in a city where the omakase is actually extremely fresh and the sushi is exceptional. However, this place still beats out the sushi at home. The chefs are friendly and incredibly experienced.   I love the details of this place. Each place-sitting, chopsticks, sake glasses - everything is so beautiful and completely makes the experience.   We were also given blueberry sake at the beginning of our meal and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.   Seriously, if you have the time...definitely come here. You won't regret it!",

You have the same excellent service and get to watch the chef's make each work of art just as you would at those other high end restaurants, but the quality and taste of this place is MUCH better. Perhaps it's because I don't have a super fancy palate, but nonetheless, this food was amazing! -Presentation: 5/5 stars. As I mentioned, each plate is like a work of art!

And of course the star was the marbled toro.  Updated June 2019:   I had heard that maybe quality had fallen off, so I felt compelled to explore I was thrilled to find that the product is as good as always. The freshness of fish is still there. The unique pieces that they bring in are still there. This is a must have every time I am in town. (I only get the nigiri course and cannot speak to the cooked items). The Triangle continues to be my favorite piece of Tuna. The sea bass was very good this trip.",

Their seatings are limited so reserve a couple days beforehand to get more options to choose from. I believe that they will NOT take you in if you don't make reservations - I'm not 100% on this  Went on a Wednesday night and found the place to be pretty full. Most of us ordered the omakase, and everything was fresh. However if you're getting full is your goal, this may not be the right place unless you're planning on slamming down hundreds. Half of us were screaming for chipotle afterward. Come here for the experience.   My only disappointment for the place was that there wasn't a lot of introduction to the menu. I was not sure if they had option to choose what fish you wanted outside of omakase. I didn't see the point of them giving us the list of fish for the day because they didn't really communicate if we can choose or not. That part of the dining experience was vague.",

Good luck getting a reservation on short notice, but luckily we kept trying the week I was in town and managed to sneak in 9.30.  The quality of the fish is mindblowing, it is undoubtedly better than Nobu or any other high end strip casino's overpriced sushi restaurant and far better priced, you'll probably spend 50-75% at Kabuto compared to any other strip joint.  My friends who are also sushi aficionados and I considered the omakase momentarily but ultimately we knew what to do:  we ordered one piece of every item on the menu.  The outstanding highlights fish wise were absolutely the toro (when I was there, they had three varieties ranging in fattiness) and the bonito, but nearly every piece of fish I ate was better than any other serving I have had of it at another restaurant anywhere in the USA, and I'm from Seattle, eat a ton of sushi, and have been to Japan 3 times.  The salmon roe was the best item and was mindblowingly better than any other I have had, my friends and I were absolutely dumbfounded.  We wound up spending about $125 apiece, and eating 22 pieces of nigiri each as well as sharing the two different kinds of miso they offered between the three of us, and a super popular roll we saw consistently ordered that night which turned out to not be that impressive compared to the rest.   Certainly remember to make a reservation in advance, this place only seats 18, and if you are nuts about sushi you cannot miss this place.  This will 100% be the best meal you eat in Las Vegas.  I've eaten all the sushi joints and major steakhouses in Vegas, and I would pick Kabuto over all of them if I was in town for one night and could only pick one place to eat.",

Don't get me wrong the fish quality was very high but not much better than other higher end sushi restaurants that were cheaper.  Your paying for ambiance and intimacy but I found it hard to justify the prices for sushi. There was nothing all that special or unique about their fish when you compare it to other higher end restaurants. The most unique thing I noticed was how small all their portions of fish were.  I am not advocating disgustingly large portions as is typical with many American restaurants but this was a bit ridiculous to me. We spent around 200 per person ordering both omakase and a la carte. I would recommend eating something before going if you don't want to spend too much money trying to fill yourself on sushi.",

    "text": "Kabuto is the latest addition of haute Japanese cuisine that's dominating the local Vegas dining scene, a highly anticipated newcomer, raved by critics to a hype like no other (reservations are hard to come by, you won't get in for months...) Blah blah blah, I got us a Friday reservation at 7:30 on Tuesday.....But I stopped listening to Vegas critics for anything other than information on new venue openings, their silly dithering about the fabulocity of every 'Strip Trap'; as if simply transplanting restaurants from other cities gives any sustenance/foundation to urban fabric of this somewhat 'tragically hip' enclave of lost souls...  From the outside, there's little indication regarding the nature of the restaurant, much less signage-it's minimal and bare to almost a fault, if one didn't really look at it and realize it's beauty: a narrow elongated window with carefully placed ceramics for a sneak peak inside, a slatted glass door alludes a faint reference to a Japanese vernacular. With such a stark facade, you almost respect the 180 degree decision to it's purity, especially in a city that indulges in over-the-top, more is better, gaudy and misaligned designed restaurants.  It's almost a religious experience with its alter to Gods of the ocean, thus we entered into the temple of Sushi!  Upon entering gated doors, you step into a different world: minimal yet a bright interior unfettered with clutter with every ornament meticulously placed.  It's as if you've entered into an art gallery, an immediate volume of space creating mood and attitude that the food commands, screaming: 'PAY ATTENTION!!!'  With only twenty seats in the entire restaurant, it's more of a boutique than a restaurant, referencing a cultural crossover imported straight from Japan.  As it's always preferable to sit at the counter, a repoire with the Sushi Chef will further inform and enlighten the experience; some explaining and background is necessary when it come to the various fish species and it's origins.  There are two prix-fixe omakase courses to choose from, which the only difference is a couple of appetizers in the beginning followed by the same Nigiri Sushi course afterwards.  We opted for the full Monty, with some Nigiri requests after the course to get a full spectrum of the Chef's hand.  The course commences with an aperitif: Mango Sake chilled with Ice.  Light, sweet but surprisingly refined with no sugary, headache inducing coma after ten minutes.  In addition, we ordered sake to accompany the meal: 'Sato No Homare' a Junmai Gingo Grande; a premium Sake that is well balanced, crisp and fruity, the texture and aroma compliment each other as well as the Sushi.  The first course starts us off with a cold dish, Giant Clam and Geso (Squid Tentacles) along with Cucumber and a summer sprout called 'Jyunsai' - Water Shield.  This dish focuses heavily on the textural combination rather than punches of flavor.    The second course directed us right into the main attraction, fish in it's purist form: Sashimi.  It's with this dish we get to inspect, (more like admire) the quality of fish Chef has selected for the evening; it's here, we observe the knife technique in the slices resembling patterned fabric-racing lines ingrained into the flesh, visuals of swift moving fish come to mind as it's presented so elegantly.  'Umimasu' - Ocean Trout 'Chinu' - Snapper 'Katsuo' - Bonito  For the next course: we move onto the heavier protein dishes.  From the left: Lettuce wrapped in Kobe Beef, 'Kochi' Saikyo Miso Yaki - Flathead grilled Saikyo style with Miso and Grilled Hiramasa - Yellowtail Amberjack in a light Soy.  And even the proteins had a heavier consistency than any other dishes, they were subtle in flavor and the textures were brought to the forefront of the palate - I would even say that was most memorable: from the chilled thin slices of raw beef, the succulent slivers of fish moist with Miso savoriness and rich tender Grilled Yellowtail, hearty with fat and Soy.  And finally  the Piece de Resistance, the Sushi: I would try and explain each piece to you, but it would be impossible for a novice like me to be in any way accurate, so as I used to say back when I worked as a Bartender in NY, 'it's just YUMMY'!.....that seemed to enough for everyone...although, they were also drunk...  'Ishigaki Tai' - Spotted Knifejaw  'Hiramasa' - Yellowtail Amberjack  'Ma Aji' - Jack Makerel  'Chu Toro' - Medium Fatty Tuna  'Ikura' - Salmon Roe  'Engawa' - Fluke Mustle Fin  'Uni' - Sea Urchin flown from Hokkaido that morning!  'Chikamenkintoki' - Long Finned Bull Eye  'Suzuki' - Branzino   'Renko Dai' - Deep Sea Porgy  'Kohada' - Shad  'Ma Saba' - Japanese Mackerel  'O-Toro' - Premium Fatty Tuna  'Kamashita' - Kamashita Fatty Tuna  'Negi Toro Maki'  Kabuto served an incredible experience; a first class meal paralleling that to any Sushi experience from world class cities...New York, LA, be aware; Vegas has a  culinary force that cannot be ignored!!!",

The wait staff and sushi chefs were kind and entertaining. It's a tiny place, but we had no trouble getting a reservation and sitting at the sushi bar.  A little note: we confused out taxi driver; he was familiar with Chinatown but told us the address of the restaurant was the address of a massage parlor. It was a year ago, so hopefully the place is better known now.",

    "text": "I went back for a second time with my friends out of town.  I was quite disappointed and I kept talking about to this place to my friends and they were disappointed as well.  First, the service wasn't good.  At one point we were arguing with the server because they lead us to believe something else.  And apparently if you are on two separate tables and are together if you order 2 pieces they just put it on one plate (even other sushi restaurants don't do that) and you pass it over even when you clearly stated a few times that two people want the same fish and so it's 2 orders.   Secondly, the fish shrunk. It seemed like everything was cut in half.   The quality of fish was still great but I can't compare them to the first time I went there because not all the fish were the same.  However, I believe the salmon roe and eel's quality were the same both times.  But just the 2nd time around they shrunk.   If you go for your first time it seemed like a typical size you would see at other sushi restaurants.    Everyone was getting impatient.  What happen to their good timing that people didnt seem to notice the timing in between each fish?  I dont know if I will be going back.    They have a liquor license now. No more BYOB.",

    "text": "This is my first review but this restaurant needs to be recognized for what they are doing. Having recently visited Tokyo, I can appreciate the preparation and pride this restaurant takes in their food. The sushi and sashimi here can stand up to many of the fine establishments in Tokyo and the price at Kabuto is very reasonable for the quality you receive. They are passionate about the way their food is presented and inspect each piece of fish carefully before serving. Any sushi pro knows that not only is the fish an important aspect of sushi but the rice is equally if not more important. The rice was prepared very well (warm with a slight hint of vinegar). The taste of the rice complemented the fish so well it makes my mouth water thinking of it now. The service was friendly and the servers were helpful in educating the patrons on where each food item came from. In case you didn't already know, they receive their products fresh daily from all over the world. One place that they receive their fish from is the famous Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. The fish here meets the standards of fish sold right at that market. The chefs prepare each plate as a piece of art and the timing of each food item is perfect. If you are a foodie and like traditional Japanese sushi then you must check this place out. No cream cheese and spicy mayo rolls here! In my opinion there is no other sushi restaurant in Vegas that is close to Kabuto. That includes the big names on the strip.",

    "text": "I really wanted to rate this higher. But my experience was cut short due to an allergy, and the way the restaurant handled the bill afterwards deeply affected my feelings about this place.   The first issue was that we had a reservation for 7. I asked to bump it up to 8 and was told no. I persisted and asked if we moved the rez time later, could it be accomodated. Yes, but then my friend didn't want to dine that late. So we sit down on the 2 tables . . . set for 7, with an empty chair. Why was 8 too much trouble to accomodate?  I had about 7 courses (including the opening cocktail) before I could no longer continue. I apparently had an allergy to something that I was unaware of. The server did ask when we sat down about allergies for the $80 omakase menu and I let her know. She made a suggestion that I stay away from another fish that is similar to the one I was allergic to, but I had never had before, so that was appreciated. I ended up having to leave to get some medication, and told the server that I could no longer continue eating. While I was gone, she apparently told my party that the next 3 courses were already made and she proceeded to put it in the middle of the table for the rest of the diners to share. No other courses came out. I came back and just hung out with my friends until the bill arrived. There was a full charge, which was kind of expected . . . but in every other restaurant I have ever worked in, when there is an allergic reation (whether or not the fault of the restaurant), the person affected never gets charged. After talking with the server, she agreed to take off $10 because she said I only missed 2 courses. She should have done this up front.   So the food quality was amazing, presentation was very nice. My friends will probably come back and try it again, but for a brand new intimate restaurant, I expected more than just being treated like a number.",

    "text": "This is a very unique one-of-a-kind sushi experience in Las Vegas, but with that said comes along the high price.   This restaurant is very minimalist and sen like. Pretty much the polar opposite of Nobu. So if you are looking for a place to be \"scene\" this probably is not the place for you.   There is basically two meals, the nigiri course or the omakase course. When I went there the prices were around $50 dollars and $90 dollars.    Due to how the sushi is prepared, you almost have to seat at the sushi bar. Which is basically the whole place except for a few other tables.   The restaurant has no signage, and is located about 10 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip, just west of Chinatown. There is very limited seating, so reservations are a must.",

This is definitely as close to sushi in Japan as you get here in Vegas. I would definitely recommend trying one of their Omakase courses. It gives you the opportunity to try the different foods they have to offer. After you have the option of ordering a la carte. Or if you're just in the mood to order a la carte that is available as well. Each of those little nigiri pieces are little bite size pieces of heaven. Hands down best sushi in town. Be prepared to spend some $$$$ this is not the type of place for someone who is light on their wallet, it is a pricy place. Ordering moderate on a la carte for 2 people, around 14 individual pieces of nigiri total came out to around $90ish pre tip. This is definitely not the type of place for creative rolls. This establishment offers a close to if not a True Japanese dining experience. Definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting the closest to a Japanese sushi dining experience. Will definitely come back. Only downside in my book is they're not open Sunday's. That's when I do most of my dining.",

It is a traditional Japanese sushi experience with the primary ordering option being omakase, where you chose the size of the order and they bring you courses based on the chef's discretion.   Each course is elegantly presented and is the freshest sushi I have ever had.  The attention to detail is impeccable and the selection impressive.  Each mini course was a delight to the eyes and every sense was elevated.  The staff was very pleasant and the bathroom along with the entire restaurant was immaculately clean and the decor a relaxing, zen-like feel.

Fresh grated wasabi, aged soy sauce, real chef, FRESH fish, exclusive seating, excellent polite service just like you were in Japan. I had the nigiri flight, oh my screaming orgasm, ok not screaming but I was rolling my eyes...

Simply an amazing experience in a nice atmosphere with fantastic seafood and great people. This place will become infamous in the likes of french laundry, Gary danko, Joel Rubichon....

Each piece of sushi was amazing and before  we knew it our 10 pieces each were long gone and we began ordering more pieces off the menu.  I have never seen my wife eat that much raw fish and LOVE EVERY BITE.  The two of us love sushi but Sushi Chef Gen may have ruined experiences going forward because last night was that great.  I didn't want to write this review with the fear of not being able to get a table on our next visit.  Thank you to Gen and all his staff for a very happy, tasty experience!",

The atmosphere is modern, warm and cozy. The sushi chefs and servers are so accommodating and truly make your experience one-of-a-kind. I have been here twice and cannot wait to go back. Since it is not on the strip, it may not typically be a restaurant visitors may first consider -- but let me tell you, it is a gem. I have been to a fair share of fantastic sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, and I can tell you Kabuto is my favorite. If you have not tried omakase before, I highly suggest you let Kabuto be your first taste.",

The fish is spectacular (especially the Tazmanian trout), melting in your mouth and served both sushi and sashimi-style over warm rice.  Although a bit hard to find (only noticed by that one strip of light on the wall) once you find this place, being served here is definitely an experience.  My family decided to go big on the 'Omakase', with roughly six courses.  Each of which being equally fresh and tender, finishing us off with the almond tofu (yum!).  Without a doubt I would recommend this place to any visitor or local!",

In our first visit we had the Omakase, which was great, but the cooked dishes were not as enjoyable as the fish.  So in our second visit, we decided to have the nigiri course.  The overall dinner was amazing especially at the end when we started choosing the fish to be served as additional on top of our original Nigiri Course.  We had the Chu toro... which was good... then we had the O Toro... and that was really good... Then we had the Kamashita... and it was like OMG this just melts in your mouth... The marble on the Kamashita was amazing.... tasting the Kamashita was the highlight of the night..  But after reading the reviews... I seem to want to delete my own review... since it will become harder and harder to get reservations ....",

There isn't a restaurant sign and this place is tucked away.    We ordered the Omakase tasting menu ($80/pp).  Such a bargain for the quality and number of courses compared to Strip tasting menus.    The peach sake aperitif was delicately sweet Tuna appetizer - marinade was delicious  Sashimi - so fresh, the mackerel and tuna were awesome Grilled course - fishes were good, but Kobe beef was so tender Sushi - ridiculous.  Toro was amazing, buttery, they were all crazy good Soups - mushroom and fish (we got both) - nice broth Hand rolls - perfect size and ratio of ingredients (including toro!!) Dessert - Mochi and mango tofu - homemade goodness  We're interested in seeing Chef Gen-san go head to head with Chef Endo (Raku)!!!",

Ok, now that we got that out of the way I can say that without a doubt this was the best sushi meal I have ever experienced and I have eaten at quite a few fine fishy establishments on both the East and West Coasts.   The $48 nigiri meal is definitely the way to go even if it doesn't fill you up. The menu at Kabuto changes daily depending on what they fly in from around the globe. I couldn't even begin to remember what I ate but it was like eating buttered sushi that literally melted on your tongue and drowned your tastebuds in flavor. Each piece was like an otherworldly experience that I savored. The nigiri meal also includes a tasty miso soup, hand roll, and incredible homemade dessert that was to die for.   What are you waiting for? When each and every review for Kabuto is basically a short story you know that you are in for a flavorful exploration. Don't worry about writing anything down as you wouldn't want to sully any moment of the experience. You're welcome!",

One way I relive my sushi dining experience in Japan while living in Las Vegas is through Kabuto. Their omakase menu and the quality of sushi is really good. However, that is not the only reason that gives this restaurant its authentic Japanese feel. As you know, the Japanese culture is obsessed with service. You'll find that same level of service at this restaurant as well. From beginning to end, Kabuto strives to give you the Japanese dining experience. For me, it's like stepping into that little sushi spot I frequently visited at the Tsukiji market in Japan. It's that good.",

    "text": "Please give me specific links and references to ANY restaurant you know of that's better than this one! This is the best dining experience I've had in years - fortunately I had the chance to go twice in one week.  To preface the experience you have to ignore the strip mall it's contained within - it's typically unappealing - so there's that. Once you enter the realm of Kabuto though - all bets are off - this is a first-class joint. Simple design and layout which can only handle a certain amount of people at the sushi bar and tables. I'll guess the designer/chef planned it this way - because nothing else is left to chance in this venue. The attention paid to you as you sit down - from the warm towels to the way the servers approach is simple but elegant. There are 3 fixed price meals offered - I stuck with the basic - this meal is NOT about getting filled to the brim so much as getting great food and a memorable aesthetic experience. If you frequent all-you-can-eat sushi places don't come here looking to make a comparison - you're the wrong demographic. The fish/sushi/nigiri offered here is beautifully fresh and presented like the treat that it is. The tastes are to be savored. The differences are subtle - but exquisite. It just occurred to me that if you drink Big Gulps or Diet Coke or Mountain Dew often - these tastes will probably not appeal to you. The meal consists of about a dozen pieces of nigiri handed to you in perfect synchrony with your personal timing...I don't know how they do that - except by paying attention to you and your dining experience. There are other dishes they serve - one with fish eggs over rice, an egg thing, a small tuna wrap, a cold sake and dessert that make up the remainder of the meal.  This review is not as specific as it can be - basically because the mode of the encounter, if you let it wash over you, is unlike any you will find in all but the best restaurants on earth. Enjoy!",

Normal things I hate like salmon roe even was amazing here. There were only a few items on the grill plate sampler that were underwhelming, but I don't think it's on the chefs. It's just my taste. If you want pure, simple sushi than this is your place. No funny fusion things yet no inventive things. I imagine this is what it's like in Japan. I would say this was a solid-high 4 star for the food only because I've been to some nice True 5 star sushi tastings. Because the service was soooooo amazing then it's definitely 5. We had a few drunk, loud people in our crew but every waitress was super sweet. Make sure u make reservations weeks in advance if you have a large group. I definitely want to come back next time and do a smaller omakase.",

It's very authentic and you sit at the bar and watch the sushi chef prepare the sushi for you.  We had the omakase though I think my favorite part was the nigiri so next time I'll probably order the nigiri tasting instead.  I like how they only serve the freshest ingredients, so the omakase menu changes daily. I was a bit sad to learn there was no sweet shrimp after other Yelpers raved about their sweet shrimp, but I was still really happy with my meal. I was really excited to try a lot of different fish that I've never had before like sweet lips and striped pigfish. It was quite tasty.  The handroll and tamago were also great highlights of the meal.  And the fatty tuna was to die for!  I typically don't like eating pickled ginger, but theirs tasted quite different and homemade. I really enjoyed it. Service is impeccable and the dishes came out really fast. The only minor thing I would change is that the homemade mochi ice cream is really frozen when they served it, but I was too impatient to wait for it to soften.",

The atmosphere is calm, soothing, minimalist. It is a small place, serving a maximum of 24 customers at a time. Needless to say, you'll need a reservation.  Service is excellent... Everything is presented and explained. They are always sure to check for allergies and eating preferences. Plates appear and dissapear and water keeps refilling itself, and all this happens as unobtrusively as possible. The pace of service leaves just enough time between courses for a relaxed meal. The real showpiece of the operation, however, is the food. Everything is beautifully presented and the flavors are amazing. Even dishes that i don't typically enjoy at other restaurants, like uni, are delicious here. And the dishes I do like, like the marinated seared bluefin tuna I had last night, I would order for my last meal! The $80 omakase was just enough food to leave me satisfied, and due to all the reasons noted above, is a bargain.",

Kabuto is a low key place in the same plaza as Raku, Monta Ramen, and, somewhat lower on the culinary scale, Big Wong.   This was my first time enjoying this type of sushi experience so I wouldn't judge myself an expert.  Here are my basic impressions. 1) The fish is very fresh. 2) For my taste, the rice was somewhat underseasoned.  I don't want a vinegary mess but the rice was a bit bland for me.  I'd prefer the rice at a place like Sen of Japan. 3) The egg dish was amazing.  Sweet, savory, and perfectly cooked. I could have eaten 100 of them. 4) Can't decide on my favorite fish.  There was toro, of course.  But every piece was absolutely delicious. 5) Was still hungry when dinner was over.  I expected this as even at $70 you don't expect to be stuffed when eating mostly high end fish.  I think everyone should try this at least once.  Though the more budget conscious might be upset with the value.  Enjoy.",

We had the omakase and it was fresh, tasty, meticulously prepared, and explained in detail by the knowledgeable wait staff  With Omakase and a few nigiri a-la-carte, we had these:  Fatty Tuna, Giant Clam, Sweet Shrimp, Striped Pig Fish, Japanese Mackerel, Jack Mackerel, Shad, Sea Eel, sillago, Parrot Fish, Yellow Grouper, Deep Sea Porgy, Tuna, Salmon Roe, Scallop, Orange Clam, Squid.

    "text": "This is the best sushi I've had in Las Vegas. Without a doubt. Don't expect deep-fried, mayo-sauce-based, pornographically-named rolls here. Not that kind of place. Just fresh, beautiful, pristine fish on just the exact right amount of rice. Some with exactly the right painting of wasabi and soy. We went with the nigiri course, and I added the miso soup of the day.  First, an Asahi draft. Next, the mango sake apertif. When the miso soup came, it was smoky, earthy, salty, dotted with these tiny, perfect mushrooms, and absolutely delish.  And then the show really started. An appetizer of fluke wrapped around sprouts. Delicate, amazing texture, and the ideal shot across the bow.  A procession of gorgeous fish followed, and darn me for not taking notes. There was more fluke, chu-toro, sea eel, a vibrant sea trout, jack mackerel, squid, three others that escape me and yummy yummy tamago. I ordered giant clam just for fun. For dessert, almond tofu made into a fragrant panna-cotta-like gel and sprinkled with firm diced peach.  Beginning to end, it all lasted a bit less than two hours. Slow. Down. Taste everything. Really concentrate, mindfully, on the textures and flavors. It will make an already-great experience into something practically transcendent. And have fun.",

When the Michelin Guide returns to Las Vegas, this restaurant is worthy of multiple Michelin stars. You may search many places in many cities, but it is unlikely that you will find truly pure sushi like what you will find at Kabuto. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that is served here melts in your mouth. The fish is to die for and I have often found that I am ruined after my meals that I have had here. There just isn't any other sushi restaurant that lives up to Gen-san's, short of spending thousands of dollars to fly to Ginza to eat at Sukiyabashi Jiro. Don't walk, run, and make reservations as soon as possible.",

    "text": "It's very difficult to find since there aren't any signs. I had to ask at Monta since I knew they were owned by the same. Sushimon and Goyemon too are part of the same group.  Kabuto is good. It is small. It does the upscale sushi -- like many places in NY -- but that it is in Las Vegas is GREAT. I went alone late at night and sat at the sushi bar. A cricket was jumping around on my table and the chef tried to shoo it away. It was a bit funny.  I had chirasi, miso, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri sushi. I didn't get the set menus. The chirasi is delicious - loved the rice underneath it, but it is very small... more like an appetizer course. The yellow tail, tuna, uni, and a few other fish I can't name -- ordered at the wait staff's suggestion. They were thinly sliced, was fresh etc.   The wasabi was FRESH - this was what was great for me. I get lots of fresh fish at lots of sushi restaurants in Las Vegas... but not many have fresh wasabi. On the other hand, I really enjoy eating at Goyemon for 1/3 of the price. I think my bill came to about $75 for one person not including tip. I wanted to try it and I'm glad I did...   It's either that more and more sushi restaurants are getting better or I'm not as finicky as before. I've eaten at sushi restaurants all over Japan, Korea, US - NY, SF, LA... and I think my request is pretty simple... give me fresh yellowtail sashimi and that just about does it for me along with uni. Sen of Japan is I think equal to Kabuto... and I really enjoy Sen. But if I were to go eat sushi alone again... I may just head on out to Goyemon and eat at the sushi bar. It doesn't have the ambiance, or the artisan flair, but their yellow tail is just as good.",

However at Kabuto, the prices while not inexpensive are actually pretty good.  For $48, you get a sushi omakase which features the chef's freshest fishes of the day.  We got a bunch of tuna such as medium fatty toro, ikura and toro hand roll.  At first I felt the meal was going by too quickly but it ended up being an hour and half.  Along with the sushi, you get sake and you get ice cream.  Sake was very good as was the ice cream.  I've never had roasted green tea ice cream.  It was such a great flavor.  I'd definitely come back and see what's fresh next time.",

I even love the the flavor, texture and the warmth of the rice that comes with the sushi. You can pick different type of courses, all pre-selected. After 2nd to the last course, you can select any daily fresh sushi/sashimi as an add on.  I tried the Triangle, which is the tender loin part of blue fin tuna, and OMG! I can die and go to sushi heaven now. It was so damn good that you try not to chew too quick so that you can savor the moment.  I want to do another course but my boyfriend gave me that look where you know he's saying \"this is getting expensive\". For the two of us it came out to $155. Tip not included. Ouch.  So in the end, I loved everything. From the sushi chefs and the servers, to the pomegranate sake and ice cream. I give it a 2 thumbs up and 5 star rating!",

    "text": "Big disappointment on food handling at the premise. Big issues on communication with servers and sushi chefs.  I will unlikely to go back there. Probably never again.  Forget getting $80 nor $120 course menu. Stick with $48 Nigiri Course if you are still planning to go there. Paying more doesn't mean getting something better at this restaurant. Having Nigiri course would be the best bet otherwise you will be left hungry.  Variety of the fish you get as Nigiri and sashimi are unique and worth the visit. You will get to try something you wont get to taste even at Nobu. That, I can promise you that because I dined at Nobu last night and studied their menu for good 30 minutes.   Miso soup, grilled FIsh, appetizer... are not worth the extra $30. Avoid it. Fishy to start, and the back of the house cannot accommodate to your specific request you make.   Timing is off. You will be rushed out by sushi piled up on your plate which supposedly served on your pace one by one... I waited for over 10 minutes for a dish to come out which was done plating already right in front of my face 10 minutes ago.    How would you feel when you see your food items plated once and put them back on a container again, then to someone else's plate and ends up being yours right in front of you. That was a big turn off to me. This happened in 5 minutes after I sat at the sushi bar. I was practically ready to leave in the first 5 minutes.  Communication issue is the biggest factor why I'm giving 1 star to this place.    Attitude---Seating at Sushi Bar, you see Sushi chefs preparing your food 2 yards away from yourself. On a day of my visit there were 3 chefs behind the bar. The lead chef was nudging the youngest chef for every move he makes. It lasted for over an hour right in front of my eyes. Lead chef's and sous chef's attitude towards the youngest one was just horrible. If they think guests wont understand japanese so they can be so negative to fellow chefs... I doubt their common sense.   Language barrier---on servers, sushi chefs, and the back of the house.   You will get better service at this restaurant if you are fluent in japanese otherwise you will be treated in a cookie cutter-ed matter. Timing is off. You will be rushed out.",

    "text": "Kabuto opened in 2012, and even before it opened was hailed as the next best thing.  Since its opening, reviews have been glowing. It's located off Strip, just a stone's throw from Raku and Monta.  ***The Menu*** Kabuto offers Edomae sushi, which is a style that originated in Edo (old Tokyo). Fish should be varieties that were known in the Tokyo bay area. Unagi? No. Anago? yes. Sushi rolls are a definite no-no. Kabuto doesn't get all of its fish from the Tokyo bay area, but tries to conform in principal. Varieties of fish vary from week to week. In addition, there's an omakase style menu; at $80 it's a real bargain, especially if compared to Strip standards.  ***Atmosphere*** Kabuto is a small place, with a 10 seat sushi bar and two tables that each seat four. Unless you have some deep seated need to sit at a table, go for the sushi bar; it's where the action is. The restaurant is plain, but in a way elegant.  ***My Meal*** I went for the omakase style offering. It started with a glass of house made peach sake, with just 3% alcohol, served over crushed ice. It had a pronounced peach flavor, and made a refreshing aperitif. After that, I'm not sure I wrote everything down; here's what I recorded. **Giant clam, scallop, Japanese cucumber and seaweed. **Tuna, Tasmanian trout, baby yellowtail, and fluke (all raw). Served with aged soy sauce. The Tasmanian trout, which is similar in color to salmon, was especially good. **Sawagani, cooked baby yellowtail, raw seasoned wagyu, and {something else}. Sawagani are tiny hard shelled crabs that are flash fried until crunchy. Kabuto's version was much better than the one at Sushisamba. The seasoned wagyu beef was also very tasty. **Sushi course. A number of pieces of sushi were served, one at a time. It's worth noting that the pieces were very small - as they should be, since sushi is designed to be eaten in a single bite. The offerings were as follows (all were served as nigirizushi; all were good unless otherwise noted as better than good). --ma-aji. As I understand it, this is \"True aji\": a different species of horse mackerel than what is normally served in the United States. --houbou (gurnard). No, I've never heard of it, either. --umimasu (Tasmanian trout). Very good stuff. --hotate (scallop). When scallop is good, it can be really, really good. This was one of those instances. It was sweet, with no off flavor. I'm not sure how to describe the texture; I want to say \"soft\" and \"firm\" at the same time. --chutoro (moderately fatty tuna). This was as good as some restaurants' otoro. --ikura (salmon roe). Served over rice, in a tiny saucer. The roe were smaller and less fishy than normal. --anago (saltwater eel). I'm generally not a big fan of anago. I find that unagi (freshwater eel) tends to be richer and more flavorful. However, this anago, prepared in house, was delicious. --tamago (egg). Traditionally served last. This was served without rice, and was very hot! Picture ignorant American diner trying to act cool as second degree burns form on the inside of his mouth. \"Oh, I'll cool things off with some sake.\" Picture ignorant American diner choking on sake. Not one of my finer moments. The egg was the last of the standard sushi items. However, I chose to add a few others: --otoro (fatty tuna, from the lower belly). Ridiculously rich, but I love the stuff. This was an excellent example. --kamashita (fatty tuna, from around the cheek). Where the otoro was heavily marbled, the fat here was more in veins. It was also excellent, although I think I liked the otoro slightly more. I think I've had this before, but it's been presented as simply another variety of otoro. --uni (sea urchin). Like the salmon roe, this was served on rice, in a tiny saucer. Sourced from Catalina Island, it was top notch. **Blue crab hand roll. **Miso soup with fish. **Dessert: azuki beans with mochi, kiwi, green tea ice cream, and probably other stuff I didn't write down. Not life altering, but interesting.  ***Summary*** In terms of quality, Kabuto's only competitor is Barmasa. In terms of atmosphere and price, Kabuto is a clear winner. After just one meal, this is my favorite sushi bar in Las Vegas.  ***The Bill*** The omakase menu was $80, plus $20 for add ons, plus drinks, tax and tip.",

With regards to sustainability: Save your environmentalist, tree hugging opinions for another website.  In response to those not having a reservation honored:  Sometimes the restaurant makes mistakes. Sometimes the party before you (more than likely a VIP) runs over and throws the reservations off. Bottom line is that the regular, VIP's can make or break a restaurant's business. You're simply not a VIP, nor are you special, I'm sorry. (Actually, no I'm not). Don't believe me? Read the numerous articles about how restaurants need to cater to their VIPs before one offs like you.  With that out of the way...  Simply some of the best REAL Japanese sushi you can get. Incredible all the way around! Chefs are friendly and it's obvious they're passionate about their work.",

This place is small, but not cramped, filled with a few tables and sushi bar seating. They have three separate menus to choose from. You can order a la carte as well. My favorite part of the meal is the sake they bring you at the very beginning. It's just like a sweet citrusy icy drink. It does not contain much alcohol and is very flavorful. The uni and Japanese uni were amazing. It's very fresh. They get something like 6 deliveries of fish from certain countries around the world each day like Spain, Japan, Canada, and many places in the states like California, Alaska, and Washington . The quality is unmatched by the majority of other sushi restaurants. In short, if you like sushi and sashimi and don't mind the prices (it is a bit pricey, but every once in a while I think it's worth it). GO!",

The sushi is served traditional style, with nothing refrigerated and served fresh daily.  We started with a flavored saki (plum wine i think?) to clean the palate.  Each piece was a work of art.  It is a great event and time to eat at Kabuto.  Closest thing in Las Vegas that we can get to Jiro's sushi.  Actually, to get an idea of the experience at Kabuto, it's sort of like this:  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6-azQ3ksPA0&s=94e46bf5b5f05a91b49339c8dc948c8cfd370410db78f7a8ea2185e8498fa11e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=6-az...</a>  Great time, but if you don't care about $$$ when it comes to sushi, this is definitely your sushi spot!",

    "text": "I went to Kabuto with high expectations and was mostly disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I think I still would've been a bit disappointed if I had gone in without expectations, especially since the prices aren't cheap (though not obscene either).  Here's the lowdown:  Decor: Great. Beautifully minimalist with clean lines and nice small details  Service: Poor.  Waitresses were difficult to communicate with and frankly a bit awkward both over the phone and in person. They didn't explain the very simple menu options, mixed up our order, and the timing of the food service was off (friend was almost done with his sashimi before I got my first bite of food).  As for our sushi chef, he clearly was an apprentice and served the sushi way too quickly to the point where I felt rushed. He also never made an effort to engage us in conversation or describe what he was serving beyond the name of the fish and where it came from. This was very disappointing as interacting with the chef  is usually a highlight of eating at a sushi bar for me.  Food: Mostly just ok, but the uni/ikura (that's sea urchin and salmon roe to the uninitiated) dish was amazing.  I ordered the nigiri tasting menu and while thought the fish was fresh and well prepared, there was no flow to the meal and most of the pieces were nothing special taste-wise, The toro handroll at the end was very very good despite being quite simple.  Overall: Lots of hype but doesn't deliver. Not bad, just not great.",

    "text": "Went to Vegas on business and this was our first night in town. We had several vendor dinners lined up for the week but we were on our own this night and I was really hoping to find something that wouldn't be too touristy or too heavy.  Between Yelp and Chowhound I decided this was the place to try.   I made a reservation for the 8:30 seating at the sushi bar. The lady on the phone was very cute - she asked if I'd ever been there before and when I said no, she said \"I have to let you know that we are a fine sushi restaurant and don't have steak or chicken or sushi rolls.\"  Hehe.  I guess they get a lot of people who want some chicken fried rice and a California Roll and who pitch a fit when they can't get it?  Anyway, I assured her it was fine, that we wanted sushi, sushi, sushi.  We opted for the large omakase option ($120) and I honestly can't remember everything (maybe due to the 24 oz bottle of sake we split?) but I can tell you that the salmon roe and the blue fin tuna were my favorites. There was an amuse with monk fish liver that was also enough to make me weep.  The \"grill\" course was fine - eel, seared tuna and a couple of other things, but I would have preferred more nigiri.    I make it to Vegas every couple of years, sometimes more often. I just hope they're still in business on my next trip because I will return, maybe for multiple meals, when I get the chance.",

The fish courses presented during our $80 pp meal was just okay, most were easily forgettable. The major letdown had to be the cooked dishes served before the nigiri tasting. The fish were a bit over cooked (stiff and dry), and I think could've been excluded from the meal.   The chef did a good job in explaining each nigiri and also gave us generous cuts when we ordered a la carte. The waitresses were friendly and attentive.   All in all, I think this is good for Las Vegas but won't hold a candle to many places in SF/NYC.",

Worth the drive or taxi ride off strip.  Definitely some of the best sushi around and the Kabuto Omakase at $120 (hot tea was included) is both filling and a great tour of diversity of flavors and preparation. Omakase included a 2oz housemade peach sake, appetizer plate, sashimi plate, grill plate, sushi, hand roll, miso soup, and desert. Sushi fish from Japan, Spain and around the US. Delicious!  I got there at 6p and within a half hour the counter was full and a large group at the tables, so reservations are worthwhile. They warned me on the phone that dinner would take 2 hours and it clocked in at 1.5hrs making me think that they only have 2 seatings at 6 and 8p by reservation.  Door is unmarked so go by address. Same mall, parking lot as a bunch of Asian restaurants.",

    "text": "You know, I'm not sure what else I could say about Kabuto besides the fact that it is absolutely amazing. I have always wanted to dine here due to the reviews and I finally got a chance last night to experience the magic .. or awkwardness, whichever it correlates to.   Our reservation was for 6 pm so when we got there, we were the ONLY ones there, which was why I said it was awkward. There were 8 seats available at the bar with 4 chefs all ready to prepare food. I believe there were also 2 tables and that was it. It's a pretty small yet cozy establishment that brings a completely different atmosphere than I've had before. In fact, it felt really weird to me that there was someone constantly there waiting on me. I guess I'm just not used to fancy. I'm just a simple country girl :P  Anywho, we both chose the Nigiri course which consists of aperitif sake, amuse, 10 pc nigiri, a hand roll, and dessert. With that, we got an order of their Five Star Sashimi plate as well. We each also got plum wine, one with ice and one without.  The sake was grapefruit flavored and it was light. It's too bad that I'm not a huge fan of grapefruit due to the bitterness of the after taste but it was still very refreshing. The amuse, I believe was soy marinated bonito with cucumber and seaweed. Quality, quality, quality. You can taste the freshness of the bonito despite it being marinated in soy sauce.   Then came the five star sashimi plate which included blue fin tuna, orange clam, gingko fish, live scallop, and pacific pike. I must say that the live scallop was very delicious and it was different from the last time I had a piece of live scallop. The last time I had live scallop, it was quite slimy but Kabuto's live scallop did not give off that impression at all. Another surprise for me was the pacific pike. The fish itself was a little bit more stronger than the others yet not overwhelming. Plus they topped the fish with some ginger and green onion and combined with their house made soy sauce, the taste brought up some really warm and fuzzy feelings. The tasted reminded me of home. Kabuto is the second restaurant to be able to serve me something that reminded me of my mother's cooking. Amazing.   Now onto the 10 pc nigiri! The chefs serve you this piece by piece so not everything is out in front of you at once, which was a very new experience for me. We had:   Deep sea porgy, blue fin tuna, opal eye, baby amber jack, chu-toro, giant octopus, shad, salmon roe, chopped otoro, and sweet omelet. I liked all of them and I liked how I've never tried some of these before. Though, the ONE nigiri that stood out the MOST to me out of the 10 piece course was the Ikura aka salmon roe. Maybe it's because I've had salmon roe before at other Japanese restaurants so when I had it at Kabuto, I noticed the DRASTIC difference. I normally don't care for salmon roe because it is very salty and sometimes with a taste of ocean water. However, Kabuto's salmon roe is just heaven. Theirs wasn't overly salty and it tasted SO good with their sushi rice. I'm not even sure how to describe the feeling. I was just in LOVE. On that note, Kabuto has amazing sushi rice. I really wanted to order a side of sushi rice ...   We also ordered some nigiri al la carte .. because I just HAD to try their Japanese uni and giant clam. My friend ordered bellows belly (jabara toro) to try as well.   Japanese uni? To die for. I've never liked uni when I was younger but then I discovered that fresh uni is sweet and tastes amazing but nothing can compare to the Japanese uni I had at Kabuto. Uni, when not fresh, is salty, disgusting, and it tastes like you have a mouthful of slimy ocean water. However, when super good and fresh, it tastes sweet -- that seafood sweetness that just melts in your mouth. Once again, with their sushi rice, it is amazing...  I just can't get their salmon roe and japanese uni out of my mind!   For handrolls, we got chopped blue fin tuna with some onions. The onions added great taste and texture to the roll. Yummy! As for the dessert, we got their green tea cake and their Japanese lemon sorbet. I must say .. their green tea cake tasted amazing. It tasted as though they used fresh cream and that's just so much goodness to my taste buds.   Their service was excellent. The waitresses were attentive. They always got empty plates out of the way as soon as possible. The courses came out fast yet they gave you enough time to enjoy your meal.   Overall, Kabuto is definitely a place I would recommend sushi lovers. Nothing beats the experience and quality here. A little pricey but sometimes, you just gotta treat yourself .. or have someone treat you HAHA!",

We sat at the table, but the way they brought out each course to us was still paced, so nothing were ever sitting too long or we get confused because too many nigiri were brought out. The selection of fishes were good, but not like super duper unique, but all in all, they still taste really good.

As courses came out, our very knowledgeable server explained and described each piece of sushi/sashimi. I got the $120 plate and each plate contained between 4-7 pieces--and they just kept coming out.  It was interesting to try pieces I'd never had before like sea urchin, \"live\" shrimp, and raw scallops.  Everything was extremely fresh and masterfully presented.  Though salmon typically is my fav, both the fatty tuna and triangle (a special cut of tuna) stole my heart and I had to swoop in for another taste of both.  THe courses ended with shrimp miso which I found to be ok, and a desert medley.  Overall a very cool experience.  Probably not something I would do very many times ever, but worth the once if you're into sushi!",

We opted for the longest menu/course to really experience and taste everything that they can offer, that being said this place has a very intimate setting, you, the chef, and the food.. all the workers are friendly and welcoming, the food was amazing and mind blowing in every piece you bite into, the flavors are well thought of, the textures tickles your curiosity of how things are paired very well, and how you're seeing a piece of fish on top of rice then you've placed it in your mouth and it just melts then makes you do your happy dance. The last course was dessert and in my surprise as well as my fiance, they brought out my dessert with a candle and they all started to sing the birthday song, the chefs, the waitress/hosts and even other guests that was present was singing. The best way to spend my 30th birthday, with great food, an awesome experience, and spending it with my loving fiance. We'll definitely recommend this place.",

My girlfriend and I decided to try the Nigiri Omakase option and then ordered additional nigiri  a la carte. The fish was so fresh and every bite was heaven! Some of the standouts were the sweet Uni from Japan, the oysters, ALL of the tuna (the o-toro was soooo good) and their traditional tuna handroll was so delicious (they use special seaweed from Japan)! But above all else, the sushi rice was AMAZING. Absolutely the best I have ever tasted. You can tell that the chef takes pride in using only the best and freshest ingredients.   Kabuto exceeded all of my expectations. Definitely one of those restaurants to plan your vacation around!",

    "text": "We visited this place for Monday dinner time after we made a reservation. Omakase is an only option at this sushi restaurant and they prepare the food before  you show up, so reservation is a must. They put down your credit card information, and will charge you full even if you don't show up. So think through before you book.   It is definitely a super cute / modern Japanese place. Very cozy and friendly , casual/ ambient atmosphere. Dressing up is optional.   They have $80/ $120 omakase with drink selections on the menu. Additional sushi/ sashimi plate can be added during or after the course. Last time I visited, we ordered $120 one and remembered being extremely full. So this time we decided to go for $80 omakase. Every platter comes with 4 instead of 5 ($120).  1. House sake 5/5: first appetizer. Smooth and easy to drink. Flavored peach/ mint. Contains only 2% alcohol concentration.  2. Appetizer  5/5: you can tell all the ingredients are really really fresh. temperature, variety of sea foods and sauces are perfectly organized in this appetizer plate.  3. Sashimi platter : 4/5 oyster was the best! Really fresh. Ponzu sauce was already added. 4. Nigiri platter 5/5; otoro definitely opened my taste buds. Creamy. And flavorful. Some of us got extra otoro! It was that good 5. Grilled seafood platter 5/5: I love their grilled dish. Four choices of grilled fish. One of them had sea urchin sauce, it was the best prepared grilled fish dish! 6. Home made miso soup: they give you two choices 1. Shrimp head 2. Fish meat and bone. I prefer the second!!  If anything negative to say, Their dessert : not so special. Icecream pour with syrup and canned fruits.",

    "text": "I'll briefly reiterate what others have stated before me. This is unlike any other sushi spot in town (with the exception of the newly opened Yui). If you're going with someone not familiar with the concept, it's best to explain it to them and manage expectations. You don't want to bring someone expecting crazy Americanized rolls slathered in mayo and other sauces. Sit at the bar. That should be the only way to experience a place like this.  There are 3 levels of omakase menus available. I got the $80 yoroi while my wife got the $48 nigiri option along with an a la carte purchase of a sashimi platter. Everything was excellent. The sashimi was flawless, particularly the bluefin tuna and the oyster with spicy radish and ponzu. The same can be said about the grilled plate. I'm typically not a big fan of mackerel, but their grilled version topped with a somewhat sweet sauce instantly turned me into a fan.  The only real flaw is that the nigiri course moved at a lightning fast pace. I barely had time to enjoy each piece before the next arrived.  The atmosphere isn't for everyone. It's not a fun environment where you can kick back and relax. It's more like a shrine to the food. Or more like an art gallery where you have to pay homage to the works of art in near silence. But the food proves worthy of the setting as it's beauty and precision is something to behold.",

I thought we had found the most magical, low-profile, scrumptious and beautimous sushi joint in the world (big shout out to Zushi Puzzle in SF) until we came across Kabuto, tucked away hidden from the untrained eye in a small plaza in Spring Valley.   The Kabuto omakase is ridiculous in the most glorious of ways. Course after course, every creation was absolute perfect in both taste and presentation. Sitting at the counter is a must. The nigiri.. oh, the nigiri! Chef Gen-san, I love you. Watching the man work in itself is something to cherish. The presenting of each individual nigiri really does top off the entire experience.   It is pricey but, needless to say, worth every penny. Happily digging through every nook and cranny of my humble abode to save up for my next Kabuto adventure.",

She doesn't know what she's talking about. A. They don't. B. Everything is prepped an appropriate amount of time to your menu order. C. Their presentation requires them do prep. It's a restaurant for Christ sake!  Sit at the bar. Make reservations. They'll tell you the name of the fish you're eating and where they're from. Mine was Guss, Larry, Charles, Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria from Spain, Seattle, Tokyo and Kickapoo Nebraska...? I dunno my memory may be a little fuzzy on that last part.",

    "text": "The one word to describe this place is EXQUISITE! If you enjoyed the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi, you will appreciate this restaurant.  The first thing they served was homemade sake- tasted so sweet and refreshing. I wish there were more! The sushi is so fresh and made with such grace and delicacy. Fish we had that night were flown in from Spain and Japan. The chefs washed their hands each time they touch the rice, fish and brushes- what an art form. The fatty tuna- o toro, was my fave. Can't remember what the other fish were- the chef chose wha we'd have. Chefs were not only skilled, but really friendly to talk to.   The strawberry crepe cake is HEAVEN. One of the best desserts I've ever had. The top part is brulee, so there's this delicate crunch when you dig into the soft, creamy layers. The cream is not too sweet and rich, and taste like strawberry pocky. I'm drooling as I write.  Service was excellent, considerate and impressively well mannered. Waitresses watched us like hawks behind our backs. The second our plate was empty, they cleared it up! Chefs bowed before serving and each time we complimented them. They kept the flow of food at a good pace. Didn't feel comfortable taking pics of the food since we sat in front of the chefs.  Ambience is very zen like, lots of warm colored pine wood, and remarkably clean. Chefs keep their stations so immaculate. Everything in there is beautiful. Even the mats, all white with a painted shrimp in the corner, looked like artwork. Glad I didn't drip anything on there, even though it's probably thrown away afterward. The attention to detail is reflected from the food to the handmade origami toothpick holder.  It's like a museum in there- spotless, with live art, culture and history.   Some tips:  No restaurant name outside. It's a white color wall with a long rectangular window. The person on the phone was very specific about where it was so we had no trouble recognizing it.  Go on a weekday and make reservations. There' only 8-10 seats at the bar and ~2 other tables. We went on a Wed night and made last minute reservations. Luckily there weren't much people around.   $48 menu is enough for me! I had the $80 menu, but it was too much food! My bf had the $48 one and was really full too. I was dumbfounded by the time they gave me the miso soup and handroll (they keep the seaweed perfectly crispy), I was so full by then, but had to finish it while it was fresh! It's pricey but thought quality of the food and experience was worth every penny!",

    "text": "So when I told one of my friends that I was coming over to try Kabuto, they told me that the rice was too warm. At first, I thought, pshh they probably traveled around the world and very picky about their food. All I can say is.. I should have listened.   I'm guessing one of the most important factors about Japanese food would probably be their rice. How does a nigiri work would probably be how the rice complements the fish. This is probably the biggest fail for any Japanese restaurants I've been to.  I came here because of Yelp ratings, no doubt their fish quality was good, but honestly I was unable to enjoy any of it because it was completely ruined by the rice. It was very warm, I call it sticky rice because it was basically one bite of rice ball. There was no texture to it, it was overcooked, doesn't matter how good the fish quality is, my meal was ruined because of the rice. Oh and maybe the owner of the restaurant. It was a sushi chef that was behind the bar, that was so rude, talking non-sense. Loud and it was not a pleasant experience.   Please, go next door to raku, they are more expensive, but at least the food is up to it's standards.   If you plan to come to kabuto, please, don't waste your money. If they can't even get the basics right, what's the point.",

We were not disappointed.  We ordered the kabuto omakase, which is the most involved of the 3 omakase options. Every course was perfectly executed and delicious. I actually loved not having soy sauce on the table as it forced me to really savor the chef's vision for each bite. The rice was correctly prepared and gave the fish a nice little bite. All of the chefs behind the bar were incredibly friendly and fun to talk with.   Also, I like how laid back the atmosphere is despite the exclusivity of it all. Yes, you have to make a reservation far in advance, it is expensive, and there aren't many seats available -- yet it still feels completely cozy and inviting. Everyone around us was talking loudly and obviously having a good time. Not stuffy at all.   God, I really do not have one bad thing to say. GO HERE.",

Ingredients are flown from Japan Fish market daily.While I was there, I ordered the Kabuto set. This come with a platter of appetizers and assortment of premium which include a few types of Toro (Tuna Belly). If you are not full after the set meal, you can simply order more!! I love the O-toro here simply the best!!! The Akami here is also very tasty!!!",

I'm still relatively new to eating sushi, but this is easily the best sushi I've had. Everything from the food, the atmosphere, and the service was spot on. I had the nigiri omakase, which comes with a light starter, 10 courses of sushi, and a dessert of your choice. At about $50 per person, it's a steal.  The selection of fish varies day to day, but there is a list provided to help keep track of everything and find out what fish you're eating (and also to determine what the sushi chefs are saying in their heavy accents... and that's a good thing).  Favorites:  - Medium fatty tuna (chu-toro) - melt in your mouth, like butter - Premium fatty tuna (o-toro) - worth a try if you're a toro fan, $7 a pc - Kamashita fatty tuna - very good as well - Sea urchin (uni) - super fresh and sweet - Butter fish (ebo-tai) - Sea eel (anago) - Salmon roe  *Thumbs down* None whatsoever. This is easily the best sushi in town. This place isn't cheap, but it's a good value, compared to the overpriced sushi on the Strip. If you want the full experience with drinks and extra sushi, it will quickly add up. Reservations are a must.",

    "text": "This place is authentic. This place is legit. It is not purposely modified to fit the non-Japanese palate which means that this place offers sushi in its Truest sense. The entire experience at Kabuto accurately reflected our experience at a high end sushi restaurant in Tokyo, except that Kabuto is in Las Vegas and not Tokyo. If you're looking for maki rolls that come with mayo or some sauce that detracts from the freshness and taste of the fish, then Kabuto is not the place for that. But if you want to taste and experience True fish quality, then Kabuto is the place to be.  Kabuto is owned by the sushi chef Gen-san, a very pleasant man who takes his sushi craft seriously. Most of the seating is at the 10-seater sushi counter with the usual light colored Japanese wood. There are 3 tables but if possible, request for counter seating for a True experience. Behind the counter against the wall, is one large ikebana (Japanese flower art arrangement). The menu here is omakase only (chef's choice) with three different price points. Different fish are flown in daily and the omakase meal is based on that day's fish varieties.   We went with the $85 option per person which came with an apperitif, sashimi, grilled items, 8 pieces of nigiri, and dessert for each of us. At the beginning of the meal, a sheet listing the many types of fish they had for that day was placed in between us so that we could refer to their Japanese and English names as each item was served to us. The fish was extremely fresh and of very high quality. Gen-san served sushi like the way it should be and like the way it is done in Japan. We saw each piece of sushi prepared in front of us and after each nigiri was prepared, he placed it with his hand onto each our plates that sat in front of us on the counter. Soy sauce is already brushed onto the fish when the sushi is prepared, just like the way it should be done and also done in Japan. This is so that the right amount of soy sauce goes onto the fish. So there is no need for the guest to dip the nigiri in soy sauce. After he placed a piece of nigiri onto our plates, we picked it up and ate it. He then prepares our next piece of nigiri and the cycle repeats. Before we moved on to dessert, we were asked by Gen-san if we wanted to add any ala carte sushi items from their list of daily fresh fish. The daily list was pretty impressive with many different types of fish that we've not heard. Since it was impossible for all of them to be included in our omakase meal, we each added and ala carte nigiri just so that we could try one of the unique fish on the list. We were given two options for dessert and we each went with the mochi ice cream. The desserts are made in-house by their Japanese pastry chef. According to Gen-san, the mochi is also made in-house and it uses Japanese sugar so the dessert is not too sweet.  We had a fantastic and very truly authentic experience at Kabuto. This place is a high priority for us to visit again during our next trip out to Vegas!",

    "text": "Amazing artistry in presenting the Kabuto tasting course.  This is all about the diner and not a high volume restaurant  - 10 seats at the sushi bar and three tables.  The house made sake was sweet, fragrant, and smooth.  We sat at the sushi bar, and watched the chefs in action preparing course after course.   I ate the sushi with my hands, and our waitress provided me with a towel for wiping my fingers in between courses.    Eating here reminds me of eating at top notch sushi restaurants in Tokyo.  The sushi rice was pretty amazing - nice balance of tartness with sweetness, and served at a good temperature.  Fresh seafood, great presentation, solid service results in a superb dining experience.   One of the fellow diners even suggested a great desert place (to be reviewed later), Sweet Raku, in the same complex.  As if dining at this restaurant was not treat enough.   I can't wait to dine here again on my next trip out to Las Vegas.",

Worth every PENNY! It is sooooo good. Fish is extremely fresh and flown in everyday from Japan, Boston, etc. Came here on Thursday and it was an unforgettable meal for sure.  The Chu- toro, O- toro, and Aona were unforgettable. MUST TRY! The chefs were definitely skilled. They serve your dish one by one. Servers were super attentive and friendly. Everything is very clean...which is a tradition in Japan.   Eating there brings me back memories of Japan. It is sooooooo good there! The next time I go to Vegas, I will definitely come back!  Head chef/owner also explains where the fish is from and the japanese name for it. He was super friendly. He also gave us 2 shots of complimentary ice sweet papaya sake aged 13 months, which he made himself. IT WAS SOOOOOOOO GOOD and REFRESHING! They need to start selling that in the markets! They will make big bucks for sure.  They also use soysauce thats been aged 3 years. It is perfect, because its not too salty and doesn't take away the taste of the fishes.   Order the Aoyagi (orange clam)...it is so fresh and yummy!  10/5 stars! I dont think I can ever eat sushi in San Francisco again =(",

Everything I can ever imagine and critique about sushi at Kabuto is done perfectly.  I'm a very harsh critic for sushi and this place is absolutely flawless!  I fly to Vegas primarily just to have the chance of eating here!  (I know it sounds crazy, but that's how much of a sushi fan I am!) Their different parts of toro is to die for!    I have learned that their most senior chef has left within the past couple months while i was here in September.  There are still 2 main chefs that stands behind the sushi bar to handle the omakase and nigiri.  I hope neither of them is leaving anytime soon haha.",

    "text": "I definitely consider myself a sushi snob, first and foremost.  And before you even begin to read this, if you're just a casual sushi eater - like, you love yourself some cream cheese in your rolls or maybe your favorite roll is a California roll, then just don't even bother reading this or eating here.  THEY DON'T EVEN SERVE ROLLS!!  BUT if you're a real sushi lover, or foodie in general, then DEFINITELY EAT HERE!!  I have eaten sushi all over the world, from Japan to Hawaii to Portugal, at some of the best restaurants there are, and I can tell you hands down that this place is by far THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANT I've ever eaten at, and it continues to be after many years of eating here.  I am in Vegas often on business and every time I am, I make sure I partake in the amazingness that is Kabuto.  The best way to describe the style is that it's very traditional, the way it's served in the amazing documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\".  Except none of the chefs are mean! hah.  Anyway, they always have fresh fish flown in from all over the world, so you get to taste some really wild stuff!  I ate there last night and they had barracuda on the menu, and I've never seen that before.  You can do three different types of courses, ranging from I believe about 4 - 8 courses.  During the sushi portion, the chef will serve you 5 or so of his choice selections from the menu, one at a time.  After that, you can select more that you may way to try from the menu.  This is definitely the best part of the meal!  You can see the menu from last night in the pics I posted if you'd like to see an example of the craziness you'll get here (Note, I am trying to figure out how to post pics!).  Place is small, I definitely recommend eating at the sushi bar so you can all the goings-on.  Sake menu changes and I've never ordered a bottle I didn't fully enjoy.  Costwise, of course, it's expensive!  $40 Bottle of sake and the middle tasting menu ran me about $180 with tip.  If you're going here expect to pay like it's the best sushi you've ever had, and prepare to not regret it!!!",

    "text": "I loved my experience at Kabuto!   Service: 5 stars Food: 5 stars  Reservations are required so I would recommend calling at least a week ahead of time. I had some luck getting last minute reservations on a Tuesday evening, but have tried previously on a weekend and did not have any luck when I called a few days ahead. They give you the option of choosing a tasting menu (Nigiri - $48, Yoroi - $80, Kabuto - $120). The bf and I opted for the Kabuto course since we really didn't know the sushi well enough to pick a la carte. Some yelpers recommend you choose the Nigiri course and then add a la carte what you want, but if you aren't as familiar with the sushi you should definitely choose the Kabuto option! The chef also lets you choose two fish off the menu after the tasting, so you get to try anything you liked twice or opt for a new item. Overall, our dining experience was wonderful. The fish was the freshest fish I've ever had. My favorite was the marbled fatty tuna and the spotted mackerel. They ship their fish in daily from Chile and/or Japan. They serve Miso soup at the end, and I was so glad they did that! I was so full off my Kabuto course that I barely had room for the soup. The chef was kind enough to tell me to take a few sips to balance the \"cold\" fish. Seriously, a great meal!!!  The waitress was great and attentive. She gave us great recommendations around which sake to drink with our fish. She was very attentive, but not encroaching.   Overall, a great experience. I definitely plan on visiting again the next time I'm in Vegas!",

Everything from the aperitif pineapple sake that is house-made, to the meticulously prepared sashimi, grilled items, and nigiri, to the dessert course with green tea ice cream and house-made mochi was exceptional. This is traditional edomae sushi, so don't expect deep fried rolls or tons of mayonnaise-based or spicy sauces. The sushi chefs at Kabuto keep things very simple to let the taste of the incredibly fresh fish come through.   The atmosphere may take a bit getting used to for those unfamiliar with traditional Japanese sushi restaurants. It is quiet, and it may be a bit daunting for diners who are not used to having to eat under the watchful eye of their own sushi chef. We were a party of 2 and were seated at the sushi bar, and enjoyed the individual attention of both the chef and the server, who was very knowledgeable and introduced each dish to us thoroughly. Everyone working in the restaurant is Japanese, so it is very authentic.   I will agree with the other reviews that the cuts of fish are a little smaller than I have had at other high end sushi restaurants, however it did not take away at all from our meal, and both of us left the restaurant completely stuffed.   Overall, Kabuto is an incredible dining experience and I will definitely be back.",

The restaurant is small and have some tables, but sit at the sushi bar! That's the point of having omakase courses. Sashimis are fresh and the presentation is beautiful. Immaculate service. I learned so much while dined there. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I have ate Sushi all over the United States (hopefully going to Tokyo soon!) and can hands-down say that Kabuto was easily one of the most fantastic and memorable sushi experiences I have ever had.  I ate here several months ago so specific details are somewhat fuzzy. However, I particularly appreciated the minimalist decor (in which you can--gasp--actually see the wonderful sushi chefs preparing your food), exemplary service, and food. My friend ordered the nigiri omakase, while I ordered the Yoroi omakase (which includes sashimi and grill dishes). Both the hold and cold dishes were outstanding. After the conclusion of our omakases, we both ordered additional pieces of nigiri. One piece--Triangle--was so excellent I ordered two additional pieces of it.   I'd also like to note that our flight landed at 8:15, and they only take reservations for 6 pm and 8:30 pm. However, we called the day before and day of to let them know that we would be coming straight from the airport, and despite being 10+ minutes late, they were more than accommodating and happy to seat us (and stored our luggage!).   Overall, truly some of the best sushi I have ever had. The service and decor match up well with it. I probably will never return to Las Vegas without eating at Kabuto, despite it being off the strip (and me being a tourist).",

The place is not overly decorated and I surmised the point was for you to focus on the chefs preparation of your meal which is what I did observing him using an oversized knife to slice the fish like butter. Anyway back to the experience.  Liked the low grade sake in crushed ice but not being a drinker I gave it to someone in our party. Absolutely, until you eat Kabuto's level of sushi you have not truly experienced what high grade sushi is liked. Most definitely the fish flown in from Japan is better, the fresh Wasabi and ginger also tasted much different than I ever had. As the chef said to us the water around Japan is much cleaner which I can attest to being been there before and seeing how clean the society is.  Chef also added the fish there feed on Octopus and other different seafood than the fish eat in the Pacific Ocean A word of caution Japanese have high regard for the sushi they present to you.  My son did not eat the Mackeral skin and the assistant made mentioned of this to him .  I already learned you eat everything on your plate when you are a \"house guest\". Enjoy.",

    "text": "A fancy looking place with a fancy vibe. It's one of the places that I normally reserve for a special occasion, and so it was. The omakase choice selected was the middle option:   $80 - aperitif sake / amuse / sashimi (4 kinds) / grill (3 varaieties) / nigiri (8pc)  The $120 seemed to be too much food from the way it sounded, plus, I wanted to have the option of ordering a la carte items that may not make it on the omakase menu of the day.  Everything was generally good, and my favorite must have been the negitoro handroll that came with the omakase since it used bluefin tuna belly. Other a la carte items ordered was some fancy fishes I had never heard of before (not too notable), anago, and the uni.   All in all, the meal went by really fast (because we stuffed our face at super speed) and I was a bit sad that the meal was over so quickly. I wasn't too stuffed, so the $120 wouldn't have been a bad idea.   Surprisingly, the notable dish was one of the grill items. There's three that come together on a plate, and, it was a tuna that was seared. I didn't think I'd appreciate seared tuna (as I prefer it raw), but it was amazing.   The desert is underwhelming--they outsource it from Suzuya. I'm not a fan of their crepe cake at all, so I chose the green tea roll cake with azuki cream inside. It was good.   So it comes down to the question. Is this the best sushi I've ever had? No. Would I come back? I think for the ambiance and experience along with high quality ingredients, it is worth trying once. I've got a couple other places that I'd personally rather go to, so this will be a one hit wonder for me.   Tip: Make a reservation, and you need not tell them what your choice is until you arrive at the restaurant. Enjoy~!!",

    "text": "Best omakase experience in Vegas with amazing food and impeccable service! Every time we visit Las Vegas, we make a reservation with Kabuto ahead of time. This time for our 4-day trip we made reservations for two of the nights because they are just THAT good!  We always order the Kabuto omakase course that comes with appetizer, sashimi platter and grill platter to start. The sashimi platter consisted of five different sashimis, two types of fish, shrimp, scallop and oyster. The shrimp and scallop were super fresh. The grill platter had three types of grilled fish, king crab and scallop with uni. Every single piece was so delicious. Then we get 12 pieces of Nigiri. Each piece is unique and equally delicious. The rice is absolutely amazing and each piece almost melts in your mouth. After the nigiri comes the hand roll which is always my favorite. The warm rice with toro chopped up with scallions wrapped up in crispy seaweed is just so perfect. Even though I'm always so stuffed by the time I get to the hand roll, somehow I still manage to finish it too.   Now let's talk about service. If you have been to Yui Edomae, on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best), I'd rate Yui's service at -1 and Kabuto at 11. Kabuto's lovely and attentive waitresses pick up each dish after you have finished your food and carefully wipe away any sauce dripped onto the place mat. Yui's waitresses, on the other hand, only collects dishes when there is absolutely no space to put down another dish and completely ignores the drops of sauces on the table. At Kabuto, the waitresses always fills your sake cup proactively while at Yui, we have to serve ourselves all night. At Kabuto, they would ask how your meal is and they are genuinely interested in what you have to say. At Yui, they would ask how your meal is, you can answer \"meh, not so good\" and they just walk away. At Kabuto, you get a pen to sign for your bill and I'm sure they won't mind you taking the pen but be warned if you are in Yui Edomae. If they are missing a pen, the waitress from Yui would public humiliate you by asking you to empty out your pockets to prove to them you haven't taken their pen.  Point of my story is, GO FOR KABUTO AND STAY AWAY FROM YUI EDOMAE.   Can't wait to go back again! Missing Kabuto already!",

I yelped this place and it took me forever to find it.  there's a lot of other sushi places that have like 1000+ reviews but they're all Americanized.  HAVE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS.  this place is super small.  8 people can sit at the bar area. and there were like 2 tables that fit up to 4 and 6 people.  I did not want omakase because I only wanted fish and not other things omakase comes with.  another thing I really liked about this place was that they print out the menu daily so I could choose what I wanted.  tried as much sushi as I could before I was too full to eat lol.  they were all so good!!! anything that has \"belly\" in the name was extra good.   there were 2 types of uni, Japanese and Catalina Island.  you would think Japanese would be better but Catalina Island uni was so good!  probably my favorite of the night.  there was so much different types of toro and tuna.  my favorite was the one with belly in the name. lol.  overall I love this place! and was soooo happy I found it.",

    "text": "It's one of those places that I don't want anyone else to know about because I want it all for myself.   What can I say, it's one of the best sushi places that I have been to -- authentic, fresh, elegant, and simple.  Definitely a place for the sushi purists and fins down, my new favorite sushi place in Las Vegas.  Kabuto is humble in its appearance - located in a small strip mall in Chinatown you could easily miss this unpretentious gem.  Had it not been for the ray of light emitting from their minimalist rectangular window, I wouldn't even have noticed it was there.  Inside, it's the same.  This humble elegance is a theme in their decor, service, and food.  A sushi counter that seats 10 guests at a time and a few tables of 2 or 4 -- definitely a cozy space for an intimate dinner.  With that said, reservations are necessary.    The restaurant serves 3 types of omakase courses and also have a la carte items.   [The NIGIRI course] ($48/person) includes: aperitif sake + amuse + nigiri (10pc) + hand roll + dessert [The YOROI course] ($80/person) includes: aperitif sake + amuse + sashimi (4 kinds) + grill (3 varieties) + nigiri (8pc) + hand roll + miso soup + dessert [The KABUTO] ($120/person) includes: aperitif sake + appetizer + sashimi platter (5 kinds) + grill platter (5 varieties) + nigiri (12pc) + hand roll + miso soup + dessert  My husband and I both went with the Yoroi course and it was divine.  From start to finish, perfection in all the elements of what defines a great sushi experience.  The restaurant gives you the option to participate in the traditional etiquette of eating sushi with your hands instead of chopsticks and if you do choose to use their chopsticks, it is placed parallel to the diner.    I am almost in disbelief that a place like this exists and they have managed to keep it free of pretense and glitz.  Kabuto is easily the dining highlight for any of my future trips to Vegas.",

    "text": "This is not the place to be with a group of 7, nor do I think any omakase style restaurant is... but that's what we did. Oops.   There are 3 options for omakase: $48 - aperitif sake / amuse / nigiri (10pc) / hand roll / dessert $80 - aperitif sake / amuse / sashimi (4 kinds) / grill (3 varaieties) / nigiri (8pc) / hand roll / miso soup / dessert $120 - aperitif sake / appetizer / sashimi platter (5 kinds) / grill platter (5 varaieties)/ nigiri (12pc) / hand roll / miso soup / dessert  We all opted for the $80 option and it was the perfect amount of food. The homemade sake is sweet and delicious - tasted more like lemonade and I couldn't really taste that alcohol AT ALL.  Everything tasted good, but nothing was mind-blowing.. which is how I want to feel when I'm trusting the chef with every single course. Fish was fresh and presentation was visually appealing, but no wow-factors here. Handroll was probably the best part and the a la carte seared toro that I ordered (which I highly recommend doing). Considering how \"fair\" the price is compared to a lot of omakase places I've tried, I'd definitely come back, but I won't come with high expectations.  Good sushi, affordable prices and exceptional service. What's not to like?",

The fish is fresh and the sushi chef cuts it right in front of you (for bar seating) like any other fancy high end omakase. Also all the chefs are Japanese which is always a good sign. I had one of the best pieces of otoro ever here (ordered off a la carte, not part of the $48 deal).",

    "text": "After watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi, I've been looking for a place like this to try. I was going to Vegas and was in a mood for sushi. I did a Google search for the best places in Vegas for sushi, and most sites said this was it. Being Omakase just made it a bonus so I was able to kill two birds with one stone.  The restaurant is located in Seoul Plaza and is easy to find. The sign is tiny, but the restaurant stands out due to its outside wall.   We arrived early and were the first to be seated for the 6PM service.  Shortly after being seated, we were provided with a hot towel and out coats were hung up for us.  We were given the menu which was very simple. I won't go over this as many others have in their reviews. What I want to focus on is the food and the experience.  We sat and watched all of the sushi chefs do their magic. They were all very busy preparing dishes for later in the meals and sides that were likely to be ordered.   Once we ordered, everything was brought out with perfect timing. When you were finished with one course, that dish was removed, you were given a few minutes to rest, then the next course was served.   The nigiri is where the real magic begins. If you are seated at the bar, you get to watch the chef make each piece for you, he gives you a quick explanation, and you are ready to eat. Each piece is served at a specific temperature, one at a time, and you are told to eat it right away in one bite and not to let it sit. There is a small finger towel to keep your fingers clean as you are also told to eat most things with your fingers. There are a few things like the uni and the salmon roe where you are provided a small spoon to eat.  At the end, you get to select your last two pieces and then you are given the option to order more nigiri before the hand roll and miso are served.  I have to express that this isn't simply a meal, it's an experience. Be prepared for a two hour meal with non-stop eating that won't leave you feeling overwhelmed and stuffed.  I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "Some call it cold and boring but I call it minimalist decor at its finest. Kabuto doesn't find it necessary to dress up their space in the absence of its service or quality. They leave it up to the food to do the talking.  With only two seatings offered at night, it is imperative to make reservations in advance. Three omakase courses are offered, ranging from $48-$120. We opted for the happy medium and went with the Yoroi ($80). If you are okay with trying a few items that are not sushi, then this may be your best option. In hindsight, the Nigiri course would be my preferred option. It weeds out all the cooked items and focuses solely on the fish.  Raspberry Sake -- I was somewhat hesitant in consuming the shot of sake but our waitress assured us that the alcohol content was very light. I was pleasantly surprised as it tasted almost like Raspberry juice. It was a fresh way to start off the meal with something so light and crisp.  Hokkaido Hotate Nigiri -- Kabuto hands down is the best in the game. It was so good I had to order it again. The texture was so soft that you could tell right off the bat how fresh it was. The modest brush of shoyu intensified the sweetness. It was incredibly amazing.   Seared Fatty Tuna -- Would've loved to taste the fatty tuna without the modification but I can't complain. It was so rich and creamy, it was as if the fat was seeping through my gums into my veins.   Ikura -- I will preface this by saying salmon roe is not my cup of tea. I had high hopes that I would not hear that word at all during the meal but when I saw the cup of Salmon eggs coming my way, I held my breathe. It was unusually salty, the bed of sweet rice could not save it.  There are only 3-4 tables in the restaurant and a handful of seats at the bar. With such limited seating, that gives your Itamae the time and TLC you can only wish every chef would give to you. Kabuto has delivered the most indelible experience, in terms of sushi in Sin City, and I cannot wait to return. Arigato!",

    "text": "I've been here twice now so I feel like I can give a better review. I will start off by saying I am NOT a huge sushi fan. Crazy, I know. And I especially would not go to an omakase restaurant if I DID want sushi (cause I know I wouldn't like half the items on the menu). But since the boyfriend is a HUGE, wants-to-be-a-sushi-chef-in-the-future sushi lover, I have taken him to a $200/person omakase experience before.   And this is BETTER. For $48/person. CRAZIER.   I was reluctant the first time I came here, but the boyfriend made reservations for us when we made a solo trip to Vegas. It is off the strip so we drove here (15-20 minutes away). We chose the most basic omakase which is the $48 per person Nigiri course. The others are similar but also include cooked food which we didn't want.   I can't remember every piece of fish that was served (but I'll include menus/photos from both times I was there) but I enjoyed EVERY single one of them. They start you off with a strawberry sake which is amazing with an appetizer shortly after. The second time we got served monkfish liver which was soooo buttery and delicious (and I normally do not like sake or liver that much). And at the very end before dessert (green tea ice cream with red bean or a sorbet), they serve you a hand roll.   Those HAND ROLLS. The first time I literally ordered three more. They are THAT good. The seaweed is so crunchy. The rice is PERFECT (and we all know that rice is the most important part!!). Need I say more?   In the end we spent about $120-150 for the both of us. The second time we went with another couple and they handed them the receipt for all four of us. They legit thought that the $300 bill was just for the two of them since they're so used to the omakase prices in SF, lol.   Highly highly recommend. The restaurant itself is well-lit and minimalistic with immaculate service. You definitely need reservations and try to sit at the bar if at all possible. I can't come to Vegas any more without stopping here!",

I did the Kabuto flagship tasting and came away stuffed.

Selections of wine were whatever, I think they do the same menu better.   Talking with one of the sushi chefs, he said he moved to Las Vegas because of this restaurant, and feels confident about his sushi because they change it our everyday rather than stretching it to 2 or 3 days.

The restaurant is located in a strip mall that doesn't convey the incredible experience that awaits you inside.  Kabuto was recommended to me by an acquaintance and I thought I would give it a shot.  And boy, was I impressed!  The fish is flown in daily from Japan which is, in and of itself, really impressive.  Everything about this place was awesome; the food was perfect and I loved the staff's attention to detail.  There are three omakase options, priced at $48/$80/$120 and I chose the latter.  I will attempt to recount the meal as accurately as possible; I have uploaded photos and captioned them.  I normally don't take food pictures, but I was inspired by a friend (=P) so please forgive any photos did not turn out well (the lighting was definitely not optimal for photos where I was seated).",

You can probably get away with the $80 menu and order more of your nigiri favorites at the end which are extremely well priced for their quality.  The sushi is flown in fresh from around the world and is incredible (my favorites are the KAMASHITA fatty tuna and the incredible UNI), the service is excellent and not at all pretentious (both the waitress and the very friendly sushi chefs), the decor is elegant while inviting and the price is right.  Highly recommended. On par with high-end omakase meals I've had in Tokyo where I paid 3x the cost.",

We were promptly seated by the friendly staff.  The menu is very simple, pretty much $45, $80 and $120 tasting menus.  Our party opted for the $80 and this was plenty of options in our dishes.  The service was great and the staff was friendly and attentive.  The starter was a peach sake that the owner made himself.  The raw fish dishes were amazing and fresh!  The grilled fish was amazing, I personally loved the one with glazed miso. Everything was so simple yet delicious and presented well on each plate.  I definitely would go back here again, one of the best meals I had while here in Vegas.",

We first ate next at the two shops next door to Kabuto (trattoria nakamuta-ya and big wongs, both great!) and decided to splurge as it was my 29th birthday.   It was hands down the best experience and meal I've had EVER!   We ordered the $48 set menu which came with a home brewed sake apperitif, amuse, 10 nigiris, a hand roll and desert. None of which was short of amazing!  Once the 10 nigiris are served u have the option to order extra sushi from the daily menu. The japanese urchin came in on that day and it was delicious. Along with the Otoro (full fat tuna) and the inhouse cooked eel, hell everything we ordered was like a party for our taste buds! The triangle, the medium fat tuna, the salmon roe, the hand roll was ridiculous good (you will never eat another roll like it), even the omlette was on a whole 'nother level!  We sat at the bar infront of the sushi chef, who took the time to explain each piece to us and also help us decide which extras to order (we ordered half the list lol). Waitress also always ensured my sake cup was full.   Was a once in a lifetime experience! Best meal I've ever had, made me open a yelp account!",

A reservation is required. I called early that day to reserve a table for four, but they were booked; however, I put us on the waiting list in case someone cancelled. Voila, someone did, and we got our reservation for 8:30pm that day.   We ordered the \"Kabuto\" omakase. 9 courses for something like $120.   I had the best tuna I've ever had here. The bluefin tuna is my favorite. But if you're a fan of fatty tuna, try every type they have. They have at least four fat-levels of tuna.   Negatives: They didn't have salmon! Too much cooked fish! Tiramisu was nothing special, according to everyone at my table.   The two foodies at our table really enjoyed everything. To be honest, I still prefer all-you-can-eat sushi. I'm not sure this is really worth it.   However, my sister--a novice at eating raw seafood--only ate half the stuff she was served, picked at it, and looked at it in disgust for most of the night. To be honest, her disgust might have been contagious, and we would have enjoyed the food a lot more if it weren't for her, ha. It all went downhill after the big sea snail.   I'm not generally a fan of sake, but this sake was better than what I'm used to. Don't remember the name, but the description was \"deep and rich.\" Accurate.   The dessert options were very interesting! I got the sorbet which was good. The balloon custard looked really interesting--it actually comes in a balloon.   All in all, I'd come here again.",

This was my first time trying omakase sushi and needless to say, it was a fantastic experience all around.  The restaurant has very limited seating, about 20 seats, so make reservations.  Decor is simple and clean.  We sat at the sushi bar in front of chef Hiro, which turned out to be a big bonus bc he gave us a lot of insights into the food the that was preparing for us.  The sushi:  fresh, high quality, and served at the right temperature.  We tried the $40 and $120 omakase.  The $120 is def the way to go as it was a few levels above the cheaper course in terms of quality.  We also ordered a la carte in addition to the omakase and that was very good as well.  There's also a good variety of sake, many homemade.  We are not big drinkers so did not really enjoy this part of the menu.  Will certainly be back next time we're in Vegas!",

This place is simple and to the point and does a good job with it. The service is excellent the sushi chefs are very formal but good, and mostly people are getting on the Omakazi.

This restaurant is very small so I'd recommend to make a reservation ahead. (Parking lot is crazy too so make sure to give yourself buffer). Waitress also asks if you have any fishes you don't like so that Chef will not serve them in the course meal. Make sure to let them know what you don't like clearly.   All the sushi chef and waitresses are Japanese. Decoration of this restaurant is very minimal and clean just like Edo sushi in Japan. Since I am Japanese I spoke with them in Japanese during my visit. I got to know more about fish and people who work there as well.   So let's talk about the food. All the sushi and Sashimi are fresh. You will find rare ones because they import from Japan and other countries. Chef will explain each dishes and where they come from.  For grilled dishes, waitress will explain what they are.  Once appetizers, sashimi, sushi and grilled dishes are served, sushi chef will ask you if you want to try anything from the menu which changes everyday. If you are not sure what to get as additional to your course meal, ask the chef. They will give you advises. Then you get to choose miso soups - fish or shrimp head. I picked shrimp head. I thought miso soup was just okay. Waitress will then ask which desert you will like to have. This changes everyday I believe. I picked raspberry sorbet. It was delicious. Overall, my dinner took an hour and a half from start to finish.   I'd recommend this place if you would like to have a True sushi experience.   This is not a typical teriyaki place. Please respect other guests (meaning don't talk so loud!).",

I had my doubts at first but as soon as I opened that door I knew I was in for something extraordinary. The fish was indescribable. It was so simplistic, yet somehow so complex. The chefs truly make the experience all about the fish and highlighting the product. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you want a True sushi experience.",

All clean lines and zen, blonde woods and flowers, a small slit window at the entrance and a couple of tables the action here is clearly a seat at the sushi bar and placing oneself in the hands of the itamae in order to bear witness to the incredible knife skills as piece after piece of fish arrives perfect and smooth, the rice fragrant and warm, with ample description of province and the occasional anecdote.  Featuring fresh wasabi, house-made aged soy and creamy miso, plus an extensive sake list and dessert program responsible for the best mille crepe I've had to date my only regret in visiting Kabuto is that I did not book an earlier reservation and order the longer menu; a mistake I'll not make in the future.",

I figure the chef puts a lot of thought into what he considers an excellent meal. Lastly, I pretty much eat everything when it comes to sushi.   I ate some sushi I have never heard of.  Everything I had was perfect.  I love the elegant presentation. I got excited as each sushi and appetizer came out one by one. Not only was it pleasant to look at, it was some of the best sushi I have ever had!  I wish I was rich to eat omakase all the time but at the same time, it wouldn't be as special. I'll try to come on special occasions. I can't wait till next time!",

This place is small and intimate ... and super high end with super high quality fish that is brought in \"fresh day of\".... so sushi menu changes daily.  I am so excited that I had the opportunity to try amazing fish I've never even heard of before.... like Long Finned Bull Eye and Triangle (wakaremi)...  Everything we ordered was Spectacular.  You must be willing to try new fish and not be afraid.    This is a sushi dining experience.... not a place to gorge yourself..... so do not come in thinking they have AYCE or any rolls... this is straight up sushi the way sushi was meant to be prepared and savored.  The decor is simple and elegant.... the sushi chefs are artists.   My friend and I ordered off the a la carte sushi menu... but they have an Omakase tasting menu too.... next time... I'm doing that when we have more time to enjoy a longer meal.  NOTE... everything here is pricey but WOW!   Key Take A Ways...  Do NOT come here if you are a picky sushi eater and only like rolls and run-of-the-mill sushi.  Do NOT come here if you are super hungry and want to fill up.  There are plenty of places in the area for that kind of eating... so go there.  Reserve Kabuto as the rare or special occasion where you want to Experience sensational sushi.",

They import their food from all around US(Seattle,California & Boston) and the world(Spain and Japan). My piece of advice always go for the KABUTO omakase set, you'll get to have their sashimi appetizer and their GRILLED set (which is also hella bomb) . The stars of the night are the sushi ,each of them are uniquely good and has different flavor profiles. PLEASE if it's not on your sushi set, my advice is to get CHU-toro, otoro and my personal favorite JABARA-toro!",

We had the $120 & $80 Omakase. I think we had more then 40 different dishes all together. Don't worry they are all small bites and most are Nigiri. You can order the Nigiri individually on the menu, price ranging from $5 - $12 a piece. I would recommend the Omakasa, the Chef will serve the best fish of the day from the menu and you'll be able to try more then 1/2 of that menu with the $120 Omakase. It's a small restaurant, with only 10 seats at the bar and  2 - 3 tables. Be sure to make reservation, I called about 1 month ahead. We get to sit at the bar and watch the Chefs prepare all our food. Service was 5 Stars. Very attentive, our cups were never empty, I think they designate one server to every 2-4 guests, so you get what you ask for right away. I had a beer during the meal and my face gets really red very easily, at the end of the meal, our server offered to call us a cab.... that was funny but very thoughtful... kinda embarrassing for me in a way, but I don't mind. We'll definitely come back next time.",

They have minimalist modern decor, simple but beautiful.  There are only 18 seats so you have to make a reservation. As they get better known it will be harder to get a seat. The chefs are hardcore Sushi Chefs they know every aspect of the fish they are serving.  It is ok to use your fingers in fact in Japan they think you are funny if you use chopsticks.  You do not want to ask for soy sauce or any sauce, the fish they prepare is done perfectly with the proper sauce for the fish already applied if you need sauce for the course it will be brought to you when necessary. The fish is flown in daily from around the world the menu changes daily they have 2 choices for meals the Omakase Course and the Nigiri Course.  The fish you will be eating is on ice in a box in front of you for display.  Just waiting to be put into your mouth.    You sit with heightened senses waiting for the perfection that is about to hit your lips.  The first course comes out and the light flavorful fish begins to melt in your mouth.  This continues for about two hours as they come out you are told about what you are eating and where it is from.  You stare at it in amazement for a minute trying to figure out if the last one could possibly be beat?!  The consistency of the quality of fish you are being served is high.  In my mind there are levels of sushi places there are places you go to to get a quick bite the quality of fish is mediocre this is not one of those places.  This is a place you linger and savor the flavors of the extremely high quality fish you are being served worth every penny and then some...   You need to go you need to taste and be amazed.",

In my mind, something that is 5 stars is a place that completely blows your mind and you might only get to experience a few times in your life (like the time I went to Sukiyabashi Jiro). However, that's not how most people give ratings on Yelp and I don't think it's fair if I skew the rating of a really great place down. Come on Yelp, let us give half stars!  And I just have to add this comment after reading through a bunch or reviews here from people complaining that the pieces are too small: a piece of nigiri is supposed to be eaten in a SINGLE bite and should thus fit into your mouth comfortably. What is served in most sushi restaurants in the US does not fit the bill and you have to cram a piece into your mouth to put it in all at once. Smaller pieces like those served at Kabuto are traditional and proper. Please educate yourself before making unfounded criticisms.",

What we experienced instead was an overpriced, 0 thrills sushi spot filled with hipsters arguing over which filter to use on their insta post. This place isn't worth the 10 minute drive off the strip.

They pay attention to every single person and are very attentive. They kept our table very clean through our dinner experience.   Excellent presentation! Everything was small portion so I could enjoyed many types of plates. Sashimi was very fresh and melt in my mouth. Sushi chef put perfect amount of sauce. I don't like when they add too much stuff or sauces on top. It's not too much not too little just perfect!! It's authentic Japanese sushi! (I'm Japanese.)",

My husband and I usually choose the $80 or the $120 omakase choices.  It's pretty filling.  However we can be piggies so we occasionally will order a few extra fishes after. If possible and available, try the triangle part of the tuna.  It is absolutely mouth watering delicious.  Enjoy!",

I got the omakase and the fish was pretty good such as the tuna but I didn't think the fish is worth the price. I didn't mind paying for this experience. I watched jiro's I dream of sushi and wanted to experience something similar to that. I really like the decor in the place and the aperitif was delicious as well as the amazing tofu cheesecake!! Service was good and they were kind and I might come back.    PROS: tuna, tofu cheesecake, aperitif, decor, service CONS: price  TIP: Only nigiri which I like :)",

But my husband dreams of the medium fatty tuna and can eat a dozen of them. The staff is so warm and extremely attentive. I will continue to come here every time I visit because they are that extraordinary. Why waste your money on hotel sushi when you can get the real thing from real Japanese artists here?",

    "text": "The restaurant is hidden with no signage or no crazy neon sign that says it is open 24 hours. It's in Vegas but once inside, you're in a serene, almost zen-like atmosphere where all you can hear is people's cameras go off and the low voices of the servers explaining what the fish is and where it's from. Sushi tastes amazing but it's also a piece of art. Watching them cut the fish was art as well. Don't expect California Rolls or your Rainbow rolls here!    My fiance and I ended up going for our anniversary dinner a few days back, and it was no joke. Believe the hype, believe the yelpers.  We just had the $48 omakase and ended up getting extra on the side after trying out what was offered. Everything seemed to just melt in your tongue and as it did, it almost had the umami factor. We both went to sushi heaven and came back. The soy sauce was out of this world. I'm not sure if we can eat our Kikkoman anymore.   The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the fish was fresh, servers were friendly, and the interior was beautifully simple. I'm not sure what there is to complain about.",

    "text": "I knew of Kabuto's existence, and even knew roughly where it was. I had walked by it several times on my way to other Japanese restaurants in the same complex, but had never noticed it since it's incredibly discrete.  As an aside, it is unfair to the rest of the world that we have so many amazing Japanese restaurants in that complex.  Dinner was exactly what we expected it would be: Divine.  I wasn't too eager to do the grill, so just got the Nigiri tasting but the 3 others in my group stepped it up a notch.  The preparation, presentation, delivery, and explanation all compounded to create a truly remarkable experience. While some of the tastes I didn't much care for, there was no doubting the quality of the basic ingredients. Having tuna from Spain and Sea Bass from Fukuoaka was better than expected.  I can see people being surprised by the price, because it isn't cheap. That's the price for the type of fish and the years of experience accrued to deliver it in such a fashion. The service is also absolutely top notch, which is expected at the price point.  In short, I'm looking forward to experiencing Kabuto again but I will reserve it for special occasions because Kabuto is, in itself, a special occasion.",

I am not going to go into what kind of dishes we had because the menu changes daily, based on whatever is fresh that day.  But if you have an open mind and would like to broaden your horizon on Japnese cuisine and culture, then do not hesitate - GO TO KABUTO!!!    Kabuto is a bit pricey, but you pay for what you get.

    "text": "Hands-down the best sushi I've had in the US! Make sure you sit at the bar and order the nigiri omakase. The whole staff is Japanese and the service is great.  We've been here 3 times in the past 4 months and I cannot wait to go back. Too bad it's not in the Seattle area.   The omakase comes with 10 pieces, a hand-roll, an amuse bouche, a 7-month aged infused sake drink (soooo good), and dessert. My favorites were the kamashita toro and o-toro  so I always order those a la carte after the omakase.  Last time we had a pregnant person in our group and they were super accommodating and prepared a custom menu for her with only cooked items.  The place is tiny so be sure to make reservations to get a spot by the sushi bar. The difference is that you get one piece at a time, while you watch them making it in front of you. When you seat at the table, they bring 5 pieces at once.",
