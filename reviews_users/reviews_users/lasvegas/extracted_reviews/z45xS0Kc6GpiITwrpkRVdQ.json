    "text": "Being fairly new to Vegas; I'm trying new places on and off the strip. And have found gems and disappointments.   Anyway, I love the downtown area and am willing to explore. This was my first time to the D Hotel.  The hotel and casino is what you expect for the downtown area. Older but revamped. The restaurant is up the escalator near the restrooms. Really nice decor and old Vegas feel with formal dressed waitstaff.  Service is very attentive.  They serve a bread basket with a olive antipasti that was nice. Bread was soft with a crunchy crust. My husband and I ordered a nice red blend wine. We started with the table side prepared Caesar Salad that was ok but not my favorite. Liked the presentation but maybe too much dressing.  We decided to go with steaks; I ordered  the small filet mignon, cooked rare plus. It was perfect. My husband ordered the bone in ribeye; also cooked rare plus. It was medium to well cooked. Very disappointed but didn't want to send back. Doggies got a great treat. Also, all the steaks come with a sauce. My husband did not like that.  We shared the White Truffle Whipped Potatoes that were unbelievable. Only complaint is the small portion size. I so wanted 3 times more. We also ordered the Button Mushrooms with Onions that was also very good. We finished with the Kit Kat dessert that was a great way to finish the dinner and wine. Crunchy bottom layer with a Chocolate Mousse and Peanut Butter Mousse layered with a Ganache coating. Overall a really nice dinner.  I would go back for the Truffled Potatoes",

I'd give four and a half star from the food, but the service makes you feel like a real gentleman. It's definitely worth the price. And the price is not so high. I'd recommend this place if you want to get off the strip.",

    "text": "Would have given Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse less than two stars save for two things-our server, Mergim, did a good job and the Branzino main course was actually good. We were a party of four and were seated at a four top near the bar. The booths looked far more comfortable, fyi. The bread we were served was good but I found the eggplant carponata it came with was way too sweet. Both couples ordered the Ciao Portabello appetizer to share. The \"signature Zip sauce\" was too buttery and not very good. Not sure why it is called Zip Sauce, quite frankly. After we finished them we realized there was no fontina cheese on either of our plates. Our bad we didn't catch this sooner but we decided to let management know. We spoke with Lisa, the manager, who smiled and thanked us for \"letting her know.\" We all thought it was an odd response but we let it go. As I mentioned earlier, the bronzino was actually quite good as our main course. We had a look at the dessert menu but decided to pass. We were presented with the check and saw both orders of Ciao Portabello apps were on the check. We spoke with Lisa the manager a second time and suggested it was not appropriate that we were charged when neither of the apps had cheese on them. I suggested she should have taken one of them off at the very least. Lisa smiled again and said she didn't realize the waiter was presenting us with the check and she had wanted to credit us for one of the Ciao Portabello appetizer.  Long story short, there are many, many other better choices for dinner in Las Vegas than Andiamo. The food is mediocre at best and I don't think management handled our complaint in a professional manner. At the very least Lisa could have offered us an additional order of Ciao Portabello and included the fontina cheese on it.  I walked away feeling Andiamo is not interested in developing a loyal clientele.",

    "text": "Although Andiamo has only been around Las Vegas for a few years, it feels like an old school institution: dark wood, low lighting, servers and bussers impeccably dressed, bleached white table cloth, the works. There was also a nice buzz in the room with a lot of diners enjoying their meal. Although there were some flaws, the food was still enjoyable. The food, the drinks and the theater of it all were worth another visit. If you want an old school steakhouse experience and great steaks, I highly recommend Andiamo.

My wife had to shame me into not picking up the bone and finishing it off. She had the lobster risotto and she loved it. Service is five star as well. Our servers were very attentive with out being annoying. This place is first rate. We've had steaks all over Vegas and this place is the best we've had. The baked potato was prepared table side and the bread was warm / delicious. Salute.",

Between the 3 of us we had the bone in NY strip, the stuffed chicken breast, and the prime rib daily special with the roasted potatoes, asparagus, and wasabi mashed potatoes that came with the prime rib as well as the table side-made caesar salad. Caesar was good but took a long time for the entrees to come. Prime rib was undercooked (asked for medium rare), strip average, and the ricotta in the chicken breast was cold. Server was nice but seemed overwhelmed/worked. Decor was very nice but lots of other choices out there at this price point.",

We began with a couple of people having the lobster bisque which was a nice portion with plenty of chopped lobster meat a and a very rich stock.  Entrees were Bone in Rib Eye, small fillet, Salmon, and Pappardelle with veal sauce.  Salmon was outstanding, served on a cedar plank.  Bone in Rib Eye with Zip sauce was served medium but was a little medium well in certain parts but quality of the steak was outstanding.  Two of us shared the rib eye and pappardelle.  The pasta was an enormous portion of a rich veal sauce and was outstanding.   The portion was so large four of us could not finish it with our entrees.  Salmon was extremely fresh and a simple but outstanding presentation.  Fillet was perfectly prepared. Vegetables were well prepared.  Our waiter couldn't have been better. Very knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful.   We had a mid priced Oregon Pinot Noir, selected from a very solid wine list.   Great Dining experience.  Good price point for the quality.",

We sat at the bar and enjoyed the friendly service from the local bartenders - drinks were strong and well made and the advice as to the menu was spot on.  Started with beet salad for an appetizer - perfectly cooked red and yellow beets with simple dressing - then a small but satisfying pasta course. The steak was one of best I've ever had, actually cooked rare (as I asked for), with a flavorful but not overpowering sauce.  The 16 ounce NY strip is huge, so come hungry.  And yes, get a dessert - we had the key lime coconut cake which was light but decadent.  Service is old school and top-notch, including table side flambe, ceasar salad dressing, and knowledgeable wine pairing recommendations.  Make the trip to Fremont street and seek this place out for a remarkable meal.",

My friend had the shrimp scampi which were 6 ultra jumbo shrimps in a light scampi sauce on the outside of spinach greens, says it great. Both entrees came with a mini plate of house angel hair pasta which was also very good, but too stuffed to finish. Alot of food for the money, which wasnt to bad when we got the check. Worth checking out if in Freemont St. Area.",

I love that it's kind of secretly hidden to the upstairs and take a short hallway to the dining room. We had a 730 reservation and were planning for before dinner drinks at the bar but luckily were able to get in right away. It's pretty dark in the restaurant but it makes for that very intimate feel.   We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and two appetizers, calamari and crab cakes. Both were fantastic and the calamari gets I believe 4 different sauces to choose to dip in. The wine was delicious as well (another bottle was ordered...which we probably didn't need but we were having a great time). For dinner I ordered the Chilean sea bass, which was cooked perfectly, and on a bed of risotto! I literally ate everything on the plate! One friend got the gnocchi, and the other the bone in ribeye. They both loved their dishes, and I think my one friend and I were jealous of the friend who got the ribeye, because that steak was on point! I'll get that next time!   Since it was my birthday dinner I got a delicious piece of tiramisu, and I saved the rest for later to which I woke up at 4 am and ate. My friend got creme brulee, she didn't share! She ate every last bite!!!   Last and finally the best part of our meal was our server Todd D. I haven't had a nice sit down meal where you really get taken care of and I wanted to spoil myself for my 30th birthday. He spoiled us from start to finish with the best recommendations and service. If you go to have dinner here please request him because you will be treated like royalty.   I apologize for the long review but I had to hit all the points that made this place one id write home about.   Thank you again for the memorial dinner that I will always remember and look forward to bringing more friends and family in the future.",

You wouldn't feel uncomfortable wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  The service was outstanding.  The waiter seemed to know what I wanted before I could ask for it.  And the steak was perfect--not one vein, piece of fat or grizzle.  For what you get, the prices are more than reasonable.",

The service was flawless every step of the way. That is nothing short of a miracle when you put a gaggle of hens together and start feeding them extra dirty martinis.   Since it's not very adult to solely have vodka and blue cheese olives for dinner, I split several dishes around the table. Sharing is caring. We had Italian wedding soup, lobster bisque, portabella & tenderloin tips, lobster-black truffle baked ziti, and caesar salad. A couple girls also split steaks, including the NY Strip with cajun spices special. Holy. It was all absolutely delicious. Note: the caesar has a two guest minimum and is prepared table side. I highly recommend starting your meal with the Italian wedding soup. We all ended our meals with espressos and sambuccas.   The vibe and decor is very old school/world Chicago. Very cool. A top notch dining experience all the way around. If you hit up old Vegas, I highly recommend this as your dinner spot. You can then waddle downstairs to the casino to let it all settle.",

The ambiance was a bit outdated for my taste but the lightening was nice so it made a difference. The place needs to update their website as well because the menu is unavailable for viewing.  A nice touch to the start of the evening they served eggplant caponata and warm bread which was delicious. We ordered shrimp cocktail for an appetizer but a bit too salty. They were extremely accommodating when we asked for two dishes that were not on the menu but were basic to make; chicken parmigiana with spaghetti and spaghetti with meatballs. Little to my knowledge that it cost $42.00 per dish which were more expensive than any pasta dish on the menu. The waiter should have told us the cost first. Also, when you ask for spaghetti and they serve angel hair instead they really should tell you! It's not the same thing and I'm very particular with my pasta so please change your menu to say angel hair pasta. Thank you!  This place is overrated, sorry.",

Since we had 10 people they had two plus a trainee wait our table the lady knew my cousin and her husband since they dined here before and was waited on with her. The guy waiter was great not only funny but friendly. This place is very pricey but very good. The breads and pastas are house made fresh daily. The Caesar Salad is freshly made right at your table and is the best I have ever had. The chef also gave our table a sample of a spaghetti like dish it was yummy and really fresh. I got the lobster Risotto and lobster bisque soup both were good I recommend them. For dessert I got the peanut butter chocolate bar. Overall very nice place for a downtown Las Vegas Casino I would definitely come back. I highly recommend the Caesar Salad as well if you're that type of Salad eater.",

The atmosphere is very old school and the waiters dress in white blazers. So clean and so classy.   The service was stupendous. Our waiter, Pauly was seriously probably the best server we've ever had. He was so funny, sweet and just very genuine. You could tell he's very passionate about what he does and life in general. It's always nice to be able to to enjoy dinner with someone who's so great.   For the food:   Caeser salad. They make the salad at your table and it was great. The meatball. They're known for it and it is worth it. It melts in your mouth and their marinara is perfect. Bone in Ribeye. I had to get a steak at an Italian steakhouse. It was cooked perfectly with their house zip sauce. Good god alive it was great. I love aged steaks. The seabass. The risotto it comes with is sooooo creamy and delicious. The seabass was good. We both prefer a little thicker of a filet, but it was still tasty.  Pauly also gave us pasta as a side because he said we \"had to try it.\" Excellent.  To top it all off, Pauly brought us creme brulee to celebrate our anniversary. Super sweet of him and it was perfect. I'm not even a fan of creme brulee, but it was so flavorful and creamy.  I can't wait to go back and eat here again. For what this place offers, it's insanely reasonably priced. Excellent service and food. Another amazing place in the books.",

    "text": "The ambiance was very dim, romantic, and quiet. This place is definitely fine dining with a dress code. Although it is located at a famous tourist site inside a casino; the chances wearing a formal outfit is very low. My family had two men wearing tank tops and that isn't dress code therefore the restaurant provided them with two polo collar tops.      We had two servers for the night sadly I did not catch their names but they were extremely nice and one of which was funny. They seated us and had much patience with two members of our party who were fairly drunk.      For starters we were given a dip that was made with different types of oils/dressing and veggies aside with sourdough cheese bread and bread sticks. For appetizers we ordered the calamari, oysters, and meatballs. I am not a fan of oysters but according to my family they say it was really good. The meatballs was the recommended appetizer and I had no complaints about it whatsoever. It broke apart fairly easily but not to the point where it got frustrating. It's a pleasing feature only because that's how you know it's made by hand and it's fresh, it wasn't pre made or anything like that. The calamari didn't have much uniqueness to it but I liked its originality. The breading was perfect and it was not salty at all like some calamari's.       As entrees, my two brothers and aunt got pastas. Unsure of what my cousin and mother got, but my dad ordered the ribeye in medium rare and he devoured it! My uncle, the birthday girl, and I for the porterhouse steak; two in medium rare and one on medium. These steaks were cooked to perfection and was so tender it melted in my mouth. My other uncle got the baby tomahawk steak that came with potato gnocchi. The entire table also ordered three sides of mashed potatoes which was also amazing, it wasn't too salty or too mushy, just right. The porterhouse steak comes with a soup and or salad, and my cousin and uncle got the Long Island soup that comes with minced garlic in the bowl and the broth separately where the waiter pours out for you.       Overall their service was great and very attentive, they also box up your to go food for you. As they have a compliment creme brulee dessert for the birthday girl. Their food and service will NOT disappoint!!!",

He didn't \"hover\" or bug. Honestly, it felt like he knew exactly when to come over before I even thought about it. 5 star service. I promise you that.  Bradley, is the general manager. Very proper, cares about his workplace and it shows. Came over to say hi and let me compliment his place of business and of course out main man Danny.  Pete, is a local (yet Hawaiian) guy who just made my night. He wasn't even helping our table. But he saw we needed help and he was there. So thank you Pete.  Every person here is a cog in this great grandfather clock. Jewell movement. I adore this place and I can't wait to come back for another cut of a different steak.

The restaurant is located upstairs, at the top of the escalators.  You walk down a dimly lit brick hallway and are welcomed immediately by the hostess and the inviting atmosphere.  I had the opportunity to try quite a few of their signature dishes, and everything was really delicious.  The lobster risotto is amazing and had just the right about of lobster.  The gnocchi with meat sauce was really good as well.  The gnocchis were perfectly cooked.  If you don't get anything else - get the scallops.  Holy crap were they amazing!  They were cooked to perfection and were some of the best scallops I have ever had!  The service is top notch.  All of the servers are highly knowledgeable and you can tell they are enthusiastic about their jobs.  I can't wait to go back to try the tomahawk steak - a 32 ounce bone in ribeye.  It's only $65, which is almost unheard of for this cut of steak.  For now, all of the prices are EXTREMELY competitive.  Although this restaurant is located downtown and a bit out of the way - trust me, it is worth the trip!",

Make sure to reserve in advance as they are booked often !",

    "text": "Located on the second floor of The D right as you get off the escalator. Started with the calamari. Huge portion...tasty. My husband had a filet. It came with a side of angel hair pasta with tomato cream & a hint of veggies. The filet was perfectly cooked.... Very flavorful. I ordered a side of black truffle lobster baked ziti. Definitely large enough for an entree but it was incredibly salty and did not have any truffles in it. Not even an aroma of truffle oil. Big disappointment...I didn't eat it. I did eat my husband's side pasta which thankfully was good. Service was wonderful throughout the meal. He noticed I didn't eat my pasta & asked about it. I told him my opinion. When he brought the check it was taken off the bill. Nice surprise.",

    "text": "Based on the reviews and photos (and the fact that Vegas is known for having some of the best food in the States) I thought this would be a sure winner. We had lobster bisque (meh), tableside Caesar salad (very good), bone-in ribeye (pretty tasty) and some agnolotti (al dente and nice flavors). Service was very poor at first, but picked up after we ordered a bottle of wine. Something to note is the vintages are actually 2-3 years later than what's printed on the menu - hone in, high roller. We finished with a nice port and mediocre creme brulee. While the food was coursed very nicely and the servers were generous with allowing conversation between filling our glasses, there just wasn't any polish to the food or the service that you would hope for in a several hundred dollar meal for two. If the food were amazing, I could forgive many ills, but unfortunately this place just didn't live up to the reviews for me.",

The food was ok, however we waited a long time, it came out cold and our waiter or the manager didn't really care. On top of that we had to wait a while after asking for more wine and hot water. I would not go back here again. The service and attitude of the waiter and manager was completely not customer friendly, they both lacked of any caring if we came back or not, that the meal was cold and the manager didn't seem to care that her waiter was completely disrespectful to the customer. I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody I know nor would I ever go back!!  Hugo's cellar is still the best restaurant downtown and should not be missed by anyone in or coming to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews I was super excited to dine here.  Sadly, I walked away unimpressed.  It just wasn't anything special in my opinion. The service was excellent but the food extremely average at best.  We started by sharing the meatball. After the word of mouth, I expected a big ball of heaven.  What I got an average, dry ball of meat.  Perhaps this is what derailed my dinning experience. To be blunt... It was horrible.  The texture more chewy than delicate.  The sauce unforgettable.     The pasta served pre-entree tasted like it came from a can.  Really close to Chef Boyrdee.  It was cold, thick and non-edible.  My main course, the filet was over cooked and lacked flavor.  I ordered it medium rare only to get something on the upper side of medium well.  The side dish, the Tuscan Potatoes was easily the all-star of the evening.  Seasoned perfectly.... I could have ate the skillet by myself.  I love potatoes!!!  My dinning partners ordered the Prime Rib special and absolutely loved it.  They started with the Mozzarella Napoletana and shortly there after were served with a 3 inch thick slap of meat that was perfectly medium rare.  I was offered a piece which I gladly accepted and concurred, this was a great piece of beef.  Did this restaurant fail completely? No, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype.  I could have easily enjoyed Outback on The Strip and spent a quarter of the price.",

As for the salad, one of the tastiest Caesar dressings I've had! It was also a nice touch that they made the dressing for you table side. The portions definitely kept you full.  Because we were there celebrating a bachelor/bachelorette party, they even brought out complimentary champagne for the couple!

The charbroiled flavor on the dry aged steaks was perfect and the house zip sauce was amazing! Almost forgot to mention we were given a free pasta appetizer with the tastiest palomino past sauce!

We told the manager this and showed her several live flies in our food.  All she did was comp the meal (that we barely ate) and offered us desert...at the same table with all the fruit flies.

We didn't realize how fine it is until they asked us if we wanted bottled  or sparkling water.  So be warned, if you're in for a quick in/out meal - there's a White Castle across the street.     From there - everything was perfect.  The service, the food (We had a Porterhouse Steak and the Veil), the atmosphere, and the amount we paid (we luckily had a $100 food voucher provided by \"The D\".  Although that didn't cover the entire bill by any means, but it will still worth it.    In all honesty - 2 of us could have almost split one meal (although almost everything is al le carte), the servings are that large.  For people with a bit appetite, you'll get along just fine.    So in the end, highly recommended if you want to take a nice rest from the ruckus on Freemont Street.",

    "text": "Wow, what a disappointment.   I happened to be in Vegas alone on my birthday, and decided to treat myself to a nice dinner. I came here because it was the first place on Yelp's list with over 4 stars at $$$ or more. I started with the giant meatball with ricotta. It looked amazing, and had a mountain of ricotta cheese on top. It wasn't bad, but was really just a meatball. Nothing special to set it apart from any other meatballs you've had other than its size. Given that it was the cheapest app on the menu, I gave it a pass for just being good.  For my entree I ordered the lobster risotto with the lobster and black truffle baked ziti as a side. The ziti was good; again, nothing spectacular. But, the risotto was utter garbage. Mushy and stuck together, with nothing to indicate that there was lobster in it other than the empty shell placed on top and an off-putting fishy taste. I never send things back at a restaurant, but I had to make an exception for this.  I replaced it with the osso bucco, which much like the meatball wasn't terrible, but wasn't anything special. It came with a pasta that seemed to be homemade and a marinara that didn't taste any better than Little Caesar's.  Early in my meal the person next to me at the bar had looked at the dessert tray, and while they did, I caught a glimpse of a pistachio cake that looked very good. Even though the rest of my meal was disappointing, I felt like I had committed myself to trying this cake from the beginning, so I did. Alas, it was no different from the rest; not horrific, but not especially good at all.  The wine list by the glass (the only reasonable option as a solo diner) was trash. A bunch of supermarket wines that have no business being on a menu at this price point.  I have no idea how this place has the rating it does. If this meal had cost $40, it MIGHT have warranted 4 stars. But at this price point, I can easily think of a thousand other things I would have rather spent $150 on for my birthday.  What a waste.",

    "text": "I'm going to give them a solid two for these reasons: their #1 Italian Steakhouse in Las Vegas, I wouldn't believe you or the sign I saw driving into the garage.  I don't know from who or what gave them that honor but the service to us and two or three tables around us experienced the same.  First we were a party of five, and we were easy to tend. I know this because we've gone to other restaurants of this caliber and their wasn't any problems.  At first at thought we were being discriminated because they sat us all the way in the back, but later saw other people being sat around us in the back but then realized that my waiter Jhony, and the hostess were just terrible. We paid $300+ for our bill, so when your paying 40 plus for a plate, your restaurant better be on point.  So we start, my drink was wrong twice from the start, their were absolutely ZERO items for kids in the menu, asked the waiter what was good for kids or maybe they have a hidden menu for kids and it was like pulling teeth but at the end nothing.  When ordering our food, I asked about a Caesar salad for my wife and I; he said because of the salmonella cases from and from the farms that they get it from, he'll have to check and let us know if theirs any.  I looked at my wife and said WTF.  Ten minutes later he's next to our table making the salad not asking us if we still wanted the salad after hearing that the lettuce that they get is from the contaminated farms.  Pretty crazy.......Food arrived and I was okay, no way was it worth it.  I've taken a picture of the receipt, so you can see what we got.  In between our dinner, our waiter started playing the magician game, where he disappeared and appeared later.  The other guy filling up drinks also went into hiatus too.  So, our drinks went empty and we were wanting to eat dessert but by the time we were done eating and he coming back and offered it twenty minutes later. We literally sat again without being talked to or served.  We told him we wanted our check, and that was pretty quick and charging my card was pretty fast.  That was the fastest part of our service the end.   No thank you Andiamo Steakhouse.",

    "text": "Top notch!!! Make your reservation and make them early! Andiamo's is small, quaint, and classy. Marco was our server and I'd request him again. We had a group of 10 people and everyone walked away full and talking about how wonderful everything was.   Appetizers we ordered: oysters on the half shell (we ordered a 2nd bc everyone loved them), Calamari (good - I liked the sauces), Banana Peppers and Sausage (very spicy but one of our favorites), Lobster Bisque (delicious), and the Caesar Salad was tossed table side (big portion - def shareable!).  Most of us got the filet or surf and turf - everyone said they would get it again! Let me tell you - the ZIP sauce is a must!!! Don't skip that as it is amazing on their steaks!   Favorite sides- white truffle whipped potatoes - amazing! Asparagus- ok, & the lobster black Truffle baked ziti was very good!   Desserts: limoncello Tiramisu (amazing!), normal tiramisu (I'm just not a fan of tiramisu but everyone else loved it), creek brulee (normally my favorite and it's good here - but I'd stick to the limoncello tiramisu) , kit kat (another great choice!).   Excellent service and phenomenal food - as I said make your reservation NOW!",

    "text": "Excellent steakhouse, best downtown for certain! I've probably been a dozen plus times and keep going back as it is simply the best.  I've eaten at most steakhouses in Vegas and they are in the top 3.  Steaks are excellent, lobster risotto is great and salmon is tasty as well.  Atmosphere is traditional steakhouse style, but the lack of any waiting area (very tight by the hostesses stand) and small bar make it an uncomfortable wait if you don't get in immediately.  No view (or windows for that matter) do leave something desired compared to others downtown, but the food is hands down better and more than worth the trip! Priced appropriately in my opinion.",

    "text": "So this Sunday a friend and I visiting Vegas decided to eat here because I have eaten here previously with my boyfriend. Well, when we approached the host stand in front two individuals were already there. They looked at us and then continued ignore us for the next 5 minutes. When they realized we werent leaving one of them walked away while the other simply said \"we're full.\" Rude. I explained we already had reservations and she rolled her eyes and told me that our table isnt ready and we needed to wait. Had to wait at the casino bar. Asked for soda water (because I was planning in drinking at dinner) and the bartender was clearly upset about that and I kept having to tell him I didnt want any alcohol (was told they didnt sell soda water, even though they clearly have soda guns and he eventually sold it to me.) After waiting 20 or so minutes we get our table. Our food came out on time, steak was cooked well and so was the lobster. Our waiter was attentive, but because of the poor treatment at the door I didn't want to spend as much money as I planned. I actually wouldve left if I didnt think everywhere else was full. It was disappointing because I was hoping my friend and I wouldve gotten the experience I recieved before. There are so many steak houses, this one is not worth the hassle. Wont come here again.",

We had the ribeye with the special sauce so perfectly cooked and the flavor, wow!!! Also had the Dover sole, that was just ok but it is a steak house. The chopped salad worth the parmesan garlic dressing, omg was that amazing! They split our salad worth no extra charge.  We ordered the meatball as an appetizer. Huge,  moist, tasty meatball with a good dollop of ricotta cheese basting in marinara sauce!!  I guess the meals come with a small portion of pasta with a delicious creamy tomato based sauce. Very good! It also came with bread and a Olive, eggplant, and caper tapenade! How much good food can one have at a time.  Love this place!!!! Since it was my birthday, I had the creme brulee very nice.",

    "text": "A lot of 5 star reviews, but it is really more like a 3 and 1/2 star restaurant.  Pro: wine list and other drink availability is extensive. Wine by the glass isn't cheap but not outrageously expensive either. Same with Scotch.  Nice menu with a variety of items. Ordered Capre salad and it was tasty.   Dress code is anywhere from casual to chic.  Ordered a filet mignon and it came out with the correct temperature. No traditional bacon wrapped around it. It was tasty but not $44 oh so tender.   Con: the filet could have had more tenderness and more taste. But if you want peppercorns on it, you pay $8 more. That's being cheap of the chef.   There are 3 different sauces to choose from and two were bland (signature sauce was just basically clarified butter and the peppercorn was a brown gravy with maybe one peppercorn). I didn't try the bearnaise.   Ordered mushrooms and onions and it was about 65% onions. It was bland tasting and very little flavor.   But the biggest gripe was the busboys constantly wanted to clear the table. In a span of 10 minutes, they asked us 5 times at least if we were done eating. I finally said yes and went for dessert somewhere else. I know you want tables to turn over quickly but this is a nice restaurant and I expected more from Andiamo then pushing customers out of the door.",

    "text": "I was very excited to try Andiamo.  My friends from out of town were wanting either Italian or American cuisine, so I thought what better way than to try out a new restaurant, in the new downtown area at a hotel with a hip reputation, and why not experience the revolution of new culture downtown!  The Experience - 3 Star - The valet parking at the D is great, attentive and quick. For a small service area with limited space for cars, I find the valets were doing a great job balancing everything.  As soon as you park, you enter the casino and you are immediately hit with both loud music from the hotel's music system and strong whiff of stale cigarette smoke!  Then you are immediately dumped into the video and slot machine area, so there was really no transition from the valet to the hotel, it was just bang in your face with the sound and smell.  I found that to be a bit distracting.  The journey to the restaurant is also a bit like any other hotel casino, you have to wade through the casino floor and interesting signage to get to the restaurant.    The dancers - 3 star - On our sojourn through the desert of this casino floor, methinks I was seeing an oasis as when you trek past the blinking and ching-a-linging of the slots to the table games, there are scantily cald dealers and table dancing dealers? This was totally unexpected and very cool at first glance.  This brings a certain element on this expedition, yet the vacuous stare of the dancers was kind of disheartening and left me a feeling like when you discover that your oasis is well, an oasis...  The arrival - 2.5 stars - Going up the escalator to Andiamo, you can turn right off the elevator and smack right into the restrooms, or turn left onto the second level casino floor which was odd.  This is a bit of a no brainer to go left to the spacious area.  Again, my navigation skills after the table dancing oasis were very poor tonight and I turned right.  If you were really paying attention, you would find that Andiamo is tucked into a small alley way next to the toilets with tons of toilet traffic.  The good news is that once you enter the brick tunnel entrance, you feel that you are being transported through a catacomb from the loud and boisterous babble of toilet traffic to the enticing smells and taste of the restaurant.  The arrival finally was itself great, the journey was worth the trip.  The service - 5 star - What you get right away upon entering Andiamo is a five star service. From the front reception, to being seated and then by being greeted by your server, this place is classy all the way. We were fortunate to have John as our server and his white tux was reminiscent of the movie Casablanca.    The food - 4 star - We had a variety of food here.  Appetizers - 5 star The grilled portabella mushroom was awesome and almost steak like  Served with beef tenderloin tips, I really enjoyed this dish. The banana peppers and sausage was one of the most unique and intriguing appetizers. I would highly recommend it. The caprese was tasty, although the rather large slices were, rather large.  Getting mozzarella di bufala is great and this was no exception.  Main Course - 3.5 star - We ordered the bone in ribeye, the Osso Bucco, Veal all' Aldo which was a cut of veal pounded and topped with prosciutto and cheese.  We also had the filet.  I had the Osso Bucco which was  good over a fettuccine pasta.  The look was amazing, the marrow was great, the meat and pasta were good but somewhat overwhelming.  Not sure, but very rich.  Most of us did not finish our dishes.  The sides - 3 star - Tuscan Roasted potatoes and creme spinach. The potatoes were tasty and extremely HOT in temperature. The creme spinach was uneventful.   Dessert - 4 star - shared the tiramisu, a chocolate cassata cake. Very good.  Overall, an interesting journey and a trek to get there. The food was good, very high quality overall, however, I would say not entirely memorable. The ambiance of the restaurant was very intimate in a way, but with very oddly positioned tables, too close to others, constant movement of servers too near you, and just too busy for an intimate setting. I am so glad I tried the place, i would suggest everyone try it Probably one of the best upscale places to eat in Downtown area. On par with Oscar's restaurant at the Plaza.   I gave this place a three star overall and it could easily be a 4 star if I was in the right frame of mind perhaps.",

    "text": "We are in Las Vegas for the Valentine's weekend and my husband wanted to celebrate the special occasion with a dinner at the best steakhouse in town. We drove from the Strip to Fremont Street, just to dine at this restaurant.   Service: Beautiful ambiance and great server. Hugo apologized when there was 15 minute wait between the appetizer and entree.   Appetizer: Lobster bisque is fresh and amazing. Husband really enjoyed it.  Entree: I ordered the Frutti de Mare, which has lots of fresh seafood with unique squid-ink spaghetti. Large portion. Hubby ordered the 16oz. bone-in ribeye steak medium rare. To our disappointment, the steak is beyond chewy...He thought maybe his first bite was overcooked, sliced from another part of the steak, which also is really chewy. He fed me a piece because I didn't believe how the best steakhouse in Vegas can mess up the signature dish!! I couldn't sink my teeth in the meat and had to really fight to chew it...  Sides: Truffled whipped potato is beautifully flavored.  Grilled asparagus drizzled with balsamic reduction is top-notch.  Summary: Hubby returned the steak after 3 bites, totally disappointed and wonder where this 4.5 stars yelp rating came from. He did not want them to substitute it with anything else, because he used to work in the restaurant and was afraid of repercussion by the kitchen staff. Just think about what unhappy kitchen staff can do to your food.... If I had known the quality of their ribeye steaks, I would taken him to other Steakhouses like Flaming, Ruth Chris and Morton, etc.",

She made great suggestions for what I was looking for and I thought the food was phenomenal as well hats off to the chef. I ordered the lobster bisque , I mean it wasn't like \" home\" which is east coast and one of the things we are known for but I will say it was he best I've had on the west coast . The bread and olive dip is good as well. Per her suggestion I decided to get the portabella and steak tips for my meal. That was tasty and cooked just right.  If I hadn't been so full I would have gotten desert. Well maybe next time because I will be back again before I leave. Keep up the great work !",

    "text": "Just go here. You can read the whole review if you want, but don't let that delay you.  Let's start with the service. This is a place where the waiters all wear white jackets and treat you like a friend they really want to impress. Our waiter Miguel was so nice, so helpful, and so funny that I think he has been spying on us for years to perfectly tailor our experience. By far the best waiter I have ever had.  The fresh, warm bread is very good, but the spread they give you to put on it is truly outstanding. We did the tableside Caesar salad for an appetizer, which is like dinner and a show. The end result was the best Caesar I've ever had. Now I understand why this salad became so popular.  We all ordered our mains, but before they came out Miguel brought us all a little pasta course. It was in a tomato cream sauce and was just so unexpected and superb. Andiamo is full of little touches like that and I think it's what makes the place stand out so much.  I had the veal osso busco which was very good. You could tell the pasta was made fresh in house and the meat was literally falling off the bone. I thought the tomato sauce was a little bland, but everything else more than made up for it. My companions all enjoyed their steaks.  Much to my dismay, we had to run to a show so there was no time for dessert. But the next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be coming back.",

This was by far one of the best fine dining restaurants I've ever eaten at (and I travel quite a bit!).   I would highly recommend this restaurant.

The restaurant instantly makes you feel at home and relaxed, far away from any craziness downstairs in the casino.  We ordered one of the best tasting Meat Balls I have ever had.  The meat ball was huge, juicy and delicious.  The two of us had a hard time finishing it due to the size - we were also worried that we had two large steaks coming, so we had to stop.  We ordered a bottle of Caymus from their very nice wine list.  -The prices were better than any restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas.  The waiter professionally opened the bottle for us, and left us to enjoy the ambiance.    Once our main course arrived, we knew we made the right decision to stop before we finished the meat ball.  My Rib Eye Steak was enough for two people and was cooked flawlessly!  We also had a beautifully cooked New York Steak to share with a side of Truffled Mashed Potatoes to put the meal over the top.

We ended up ordering a glass of Italian red wine, the truffle mashed potatoes, and the lobster risotto. All of it was freaking AMAZING!!! We gobbled up every bite. Our waiter Johnny was the best! He knew what was gluten free (since I am gluten free this was a huge plus) and was fast and incredibly professional with every interaction he had with us. The food came really fast, he checked in to make sure we were good, had water, and was available for any questions we had without being right there the whole night. It was such an amazing meal.

First of all, I'm not a fan of downtown Vegas, so the only reason I came here was because my friend chose it.  I'm glad he did.  It was good.  Because we had a large group, they wouldn't seat us until everyone arrived.  Do you have any friends that just can't get there on time.  So, we were penalized for the lazy stragglers.  The restaurant could care less that we had senior citizens in our group and wouldn't break their rules.  A rather bad way of treating a group that was going to give them a lot of money.  But the steaks are what I came here for.  They are perfectly cooked.  Medium rare.  Tender.  Great job.  Some places were hit or miss when it comes to the perfectly cooked steak.  I didn't realize that they were going to put some kind of sauce on it.  I don't like that since it implies they are trying to cover up quality.  One person in the group said the steaks tasted slightly off, whatever that means.  Side dishes were good but not great.  In my search for the ultimate steakhouse in Vegas, I found a good place, but far from the best.",

We ordered Chianti wine and Caesar salad, and I ordered the smallest filet and my better half the sirloin tip pasta.  Both dishes were well prepared and excellent.  The salad was prepared table side by our waiter, from scratch. It too was excellent.    All staff were professional, attentive, and friendly. All of the waiters were attired in white dinner jackets.  The restaurant is a bit dated, but it does not detract from a superb dinner.  We were allowed to enjoy are meal and post dinner relaxation without intrusion.   Living in Los Angeles we have many fine restaurants and this one is equal to or greater than most.   Valet parking is complimentary, and the car hops work off tips (be nice).",

The asparagus was sour & disgusting. The Lobster bisque, which our server highly recommended as being one of their best items, tasted like it was out of a can & prepared with old frozen lobster pieces....and we paid over $100 for this crap dinner. I definitely recommend going elsewhere... There's a lot of better restaurants to choose from nearby.",

We attempted to make reservations around 11am on Sunday for that evening, but the website indicated nothing available until Tuesday - so we called and left a message, since restaurant was not open.  Luckily they called back around 3:00pm and said a they could accommodate us.  We arrived at our reservation time and were immediately escorted to a small table.  I asked if anything larger was available and we were given a very nice private booth.  So far all was meeting or exceeding my expectations. TIP - request a booth when making the reservation.   I had allocated around $300 for dinner for two.  We split a beet salad that was arguably the best beet salad I have ever had.  I would return just for that and won't split it next time.  We ordered a bottle of Stag's Leap Napa Valley Red wine.  I had the chef's special pasta and my better half ordered the filet.  We also added a couple of sides - asparagus and a baked potato.  For dessert we split the Italian wedding cake.  Wonderful atmosphere, we never felt rushed.  Not too noisy to carry on a conversation and great service.  The waiter was not overbearing but never absent when needed.  The pasta dish was house made, light pasta with cheese and marinara sauce.  The steak ordered medium was cooked to perfection.  We ended up with a left over bag that was nicely packed up for us by the waiter.  Total tab was $200 to which I added a $40 tip.  Not bad for a special occasion and the service was superb.  I will return.  Highly recommended.",

(We did make last minute reservations on a Saturday night) The manager came over to offer us a new table, but we would have to change servers. Our waiter 'Ioan' had already impressed and charmed us to the point we decided to stick it out with this little table in the back. It was a wonderful evening! Wine was beautiful, an excellent red blend, Stags Leap Hands. The presentation and serving of the wine was fabulous. The carafe was beautiful and Ioan our server has wonderful wine knowledge without being even a little bit stuffy or uppity. Food was excellent!!! We had the giant meatball appetizer......absolutely delicious! My husband had the Osso Bucco and I had the Agnolotti. Both Entrees were FABULOUS! Osso Bucco was huge, tender, meaty and not fatty. Serviced with a wonderful tomato sauce over linguine.  Agnolotti was also absolutely delicious! Homemade pasta stuffed with pork and beef, with an amazing pink tomato basil sauce. The entrees were so large, we finished off the left overs the next day for lunch and enjoyed them as much as we had the night before!",

    "text": "Unbelievably disappointing experience in what is referred to as the best restaurant in Las Vegas. I can not understand how this place garners such rave reviews. I challenge anyone to compare the steak here to absolutely any other strip casino steakhouse there is no way this diner beats any of those.  Do not enter and continue the scam this place has been perpetuating. Run far away from this place and the casino it resides in.   Now for the food, I ordered the 20 oz ribeye medium rare and my wife ordered the filet. We had some wait ahead of us apparently they had to raise the cattle then slaughter it before they could prepare it for our dinner. After a good hour after we ordered my wife had the audacity to ask why our food was taking so long when she was admonished that \"it hasn't been very long at all mam\".   Excuse us for breathing the oxygen inside your  diner but according to all of the history of the universe taking over an hour to cook two steaks to medium rare is a very long wait time.  Now here comes the clincher, both steaks were extremely well done and drier then the Last Vegas summers. Shocked I tell you!  Once again we had the outrageous behaviour of deciding to complain about the plight of our dinner experience and we were quickly threatened. So we cut up the steaks to take pictures but we're asked to leave not before we were once again threatened to pay our bill. I will find any site I can on the internet to share my horrible experience and if it comes to it I will picket this trash place to exact my revenge.",

Looking at the others food in our party. It is impressive to compete with all the restaurants that everyone raves about on the strip. It's worth every last penny spent.",

Table side Caesar is great, but too much dressing.  Escargot on mushrooms creates a taste of only mushroom & butter.  Escargot is lost even if u eat it w/out the mushroom.  Veal chop was delicious.  Bone-in ribeye was good, but it was covered in butter & sauce to drown out the steak flavor.  Andiamo needs to learn to not drown their food in ketchup or mayo or go.  It's no fun to eat what u can't even see, so don't drown your food.  Ambiance is good, dark & quiet enough when at full capacity.  One problem is temperature is high & needs to be controlled. Forced us into a sleepy state to want to just get out & call it a night cancelling plans to continue the party in the casino.  Fresh air & cooler temps on Fremont brought us back to life.  Sadly pulling money away from the D.",

Before we could adjust our chairs there was a fabulous homemade array of different breads in a basket with an eggplant caponata and water being poured. Our server, Sandy was the BEST! If you could clone her there would be no complaints about servers...ever! By the time we arrived we weren't starving so we ended up with appetizers. Sandy advised of the sizes and didn't try to up sell us on anything. The bread and caponata are yummy, table-side Caesar is excellent, but the meatball with house made ricotta was something that will bring you back for more! Oh, the Salumi e Formaggi is out of this world! 5 different cheeses, 3 meats, all the accoutrements and a small greens salad that made me smile! Next time we will go back hungry and try one of the many delicious looking items we saw pass us on their way to other tables. The D is now a place I will come just for this restaurant!

If you are looking for that old-world steakhouse ambience with plush leather booths, evocative of the days of the Rat Pack, professional waiters who make service an art form (kudos to Paul and Nolan) and well-prepared food that cannot be beat, you have to try Andiamo.  While we don't like Fremont Street, this restaurant is worth the quick drive away from the Strip. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "My boyfriend mentioned wanting to go to Joe's about five times in the past month, so I finally made reservations for our anniversary. Before we were even halfway through our meal, we were talking about what we planned to order next time- that's how good of a first impression they made!  We started with a gratis cold app of roasted eggplant and olives in San Marzano tomatoes with the bread basket while we reviewed the wine list. They have a surprisingly small selection of Italian reds but Levi guided us towards the Palazzo Della Torre Meritage and it did not disappoint. We ordered the giant meatball app recommended by so many other reviews, and it was great- robust sauce, ample fresh ricotta, and a flavorful blend of meats. The nightly special app of a grilled porchetta with peppadew vinaigrette, also recommended by Levi, was pretty spectacular too!  We shared the house Caesar, a huge portion with a great dressing but no anchovies, followed by the 24oz porterhouse and a side of the truffle mashed potatoes. The steak was huge, great char, paired well with but did not need the house zip sauce. It was exceptionally tender and immediately absolved me of the guilt of not ordering a pasta dish at an Italian restaurant. The potatoes were a shareable portion with a pronounced truffle flavor and a smooth texture- if you are a meat and potatoes kind of person, this meal will make you quite happy!  Our server brought us a complimentary Grand Marnier creme brulee for our special evening, which was totally unnecessary but much appreciated. Service throughout was attentive and warm. Looking forward to another visit to try the pastas or the 32oz Tomahawk!  TIP: Sit at the bar to avoid a wait, it also has the best lighting. You won't be able to get your Caesar prepared tableside but they will waive the 2-person minimum.",

He comes to Vegas to hang with me at my Pano penthouse for his first weekend out. Before we hit the Rhino, he wants some home cookin not some mackerel and radiator grill cheese. We pop down to Andiamo. Mistake. There are more convicts in the lobby of The D then I saw at Sing Sing. Ankle bracket discount count up in here. Worst part was I flipped the valet $20 to keep the Bentayga upfront. Food was mediocre. Service just ok. These people don't know nothing about Detroit either.  My boy was dropping all these references to his hood and they was clueless. Now the worst part. 45 minute wait to get the Bentley back. Wasn't parked up front and me and the boys are waiting in the parking lot like the three stooges dressed in Balenciaga. Front parking lot was an old ass Corolla, 5 series BMW from Hertz rental and a cool MB and two open spots. Where's my Bentley? Oh sorry, man. We busy tonight.  I be busy for the rest of my life and won't never come to The D or weak Andiamo again.  The few Cali tourists that still come to Vegas can have it.  I'll stick to Pieros.",

Wait staff was pretty attentive except when a huge party came in and we didn't see anyone or get an update on our food for about half hour. Luckily we loved the vibe in there so we weren't in a huge rush to get through the meal.   Food: I ordered a 8oz filet medium rare; hubby ordered 10oz medium filet. We were going to split the truffle whipped potatoes. When food came out, I had the bigger filet and husband had the 8oz size. Also, instead of whipped potatoes, we got the baked. Luckily my husband doesn't ever like to state if anything is wrong so we didn't tell the waiter that it was wrong. The baked potato was huge and very good. The filets were delicious and cooked perfectly. Side sauces were tasty. EXCELLENT wine selection. Dessert tray will make you drool. We had the \"Kit Kat\" to share and it was perfect.   Ambiance: It's a very loud restaurant but I liked the lighting and the dark decor. Very old school type feel.   Overall: While it wasn't the amazing experience I was hoping, the food was still quite good and we had a nice time.",

    "text": "We decided on Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse for my wife's birthday dinner because the menu consisted of steak for me and house made pasta dishes for my wife. Service was excellent and for the most part, so was the food, but unfortunately the signature steak was quite a let down.  Once you hang an immediate right at the top of the escalator to the upper floor of The D, you'll walk down the hallway to the host stand where you'll see the dessert cart to tease you and a classic old school dining room with some larger tables in the center and some larger circular booths lining the outside. We were seated in a small two top table that presented challenges for enough space throughout the meal. I would definitely recommend requesting seating in a booth for seclusion and for more space.  We were greeted immediately by our server and given the specials for the evening which included the \"baby tomahawk,\" which is a smaller version of the signature 32 oz tomahawk which I was eyeing but was unsure if I was ready for two pounds of beef, so I was sure the mini version would be more appropriate. Hugo provided excellent service throughout the meal. The only flaw we found was that when our salumi e formaggi board was dropped off, he didn't describe which meats and cheeses were which. We figured it out, but probably someone paying $19 for the board shouldn't have to do.  Along with the tomahawk special and the meat & cheese board, we also ordered the ciao portabella and a wedge salad for starters, the paglia e fieno for the other entree, the peanut butter bar for dessert, three glasses of wine, and an espresso. The portabello mushrooms and my wife's pasta dish were the best dishes of the night. I didn't really buy into the Zip sauce when reading about it on the menu, but it was quite tasty with the meaty, earthy mushrooms.  The \"baby tomahawk\" is where I was most disappointed. At $68 and being a chef's special for the night, I had high expectations, but the steak was a big time disappointment. First, whoever \"butchered\" my cut definitely butchered it. The flavorful cap was non existent, instead the cut was bordered by inedible gristle, not marbled meat. Second, for being dry aged for 30 days, I think I strained my masseter muscle in my jaw trying to chew the meat, especially in the eye of the cut where it was leather like. When I was almost finished, I felt like I was taking a pill and had to wash down each bolus with a swig of cab. It's a rare moment when I leave a few bites of steak on my plate unfinished.  The total for the meal was $199 before tip. I wish I could excuse them and say it was an off night for the steak, but no excuses are acceptable when the steak is your signature cut and the chef special for the night. If you go, I'm sure you'll enjoy the pasta, and I hope they do better for you in executing the steak.",

    "text": "I have traveled and eaten steak all over the world. This is shockingly one of the best. I say shockingly because it is at a lesser known hotel in the very old part of Vegas and it doesn't get the exposure that places like Delmonico's get. Given its location, the bonus is the price is lower by a good 25 to 33% from what you'll pay on the Vegas Strip. Hands down this is better than the very high end places I have tried on the strip, second only to actual Kobe beef I ate in Kobe, Japan, which was ungodly expensive. In any event, the first impression is of an old school place with darker ambiance, lots of wood paneling and red leather chair type of feel, but strangely not in a dated way. Meaning, while it has that old school vibe things are very clean, not worn, etc... so old school feel but newer decor if that makes any sense. Lots of servers make sevice top notch. As for food, we started with the well known tableside Caesar,  which is done the very proper way with real egg, anchovies if desired, and whatever else they put in it. Excellent balance of flavors, sets the bar for Caesars. Next, we had some appetizers,  including the calamari, which was better than average but not stellar, which I point out simply because everything else was so good. We also had some obligatory bread, which was good. For the main course, the waiter recommended the ribeye, which is outside my traditional filet I get, but I took his word. Along with the ribeye we ordered truffle lobster mac and grilled onions and mushrooms to share. The truffle mac was divine, better than what I've had anywhere else and it could easily be a meal by itself. Very rich, so definitely for sharing with a group, three grown men couldn't finish it when coupled with everything else. Onions and mushrooms were an excellent accompaniment. Finally, the steak. My expectations were midlevel, so the first bite caught me off guard. Simply fantastic, perfectly cooked, abundantly flavorful and moist, and as tender as a filet. Typically you give up tenderness for flavor, but not here. They are an Italian steakhouse, so maybe there's special seasoning along the way, but however they make it, simply the best steak in the U.S. that I have tried. That includes comparisons to all the biggies like Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Maestro's, etc... next closest would be the steakhouse in the Harrahs Rincon in San Diego where they literally grow the beef on adjacent property. A buddy recommended this place and truthfully as the Uber driver drove around trying to find the entrance to the D hotel, I was very, very skeptical. It is on the very edge of old Vegas, so the streets next door literally appear dangerous with folks openly nodding off to drugs etc. BUT if you go door to door, take an Uber, as you dont want to mess with parking, get in and get out, you will have found that secret spot the locals know that the rest of people can only wish they knew. In fact, I didn't see it listed on Yelp, so guessing they dont want folks to know, and place was packed, so now that cat is out of the bag, make sure you make a reservation. I can't say enough good things about the flavors here and trust me like I trusted my friend. I will making this a must visit as often as possible and please share with me your experiences if you go so I know it isn't just my imagination that it was a phenomenal,  top of the charts meal. As for price, 3 adult men, with a couple of drinks, salads for all, two appetizers, 3 steaks and top, slightly less than $300. No question it was worth it, easily  a $500 meal on the strip. Enjoy!!",

And it's served with a garlicky marinara type sauce. Definitely a must-try.   We're from Nebraska so we have pretty high standards when it comes to beef. My husband got the filet and it was incredible. Perfectly cooked and amazing flavor. Highly recommend.   I ordered the frutti di mare (pictured) as it was recommended by our waiter and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. They definitely don't skimp on the seafood. And the shrimp were enormous! Everything in the dish was very fresh! Including the house made pasta! And the red sauce has a bit of spice to it which was absolutely perfect. If you're a seafood lover, this dish is for you!   Their side dishes are a la carte and are portioned for sharing. We got the white truffle whipped potatoes and it was more than enough for both my husband and myself. They were good, but nothing to write home about. Probably just because everything else was so incredible!   We dressed up a little bit, but there were people in there wearing t-shirts and sweatshirts so they're obviously not strict on dress code.   You can't go wrong with this place! There's a reason it's voted one of the best steakhouses in Vegas!",

To start off, though, I recommend the carpaccio and the oysters. The carpaccio melts when it hits the tongue and the oysters have a perfect briney-ness that only freshness & perfect handling impart. The wine selection was excellent and we went with a mid-range red which beautifully complimented the meal.  We skipped the dessert because we simply had no room, but opted for a double espresso, each, instead. This is one of those \"event\" restaurants that you will find excuses to visit.",

    "text": "What a great little steak house at The D casino.  Situated on the 2nd floor right next to the escalators, this steak house seats about 100-120 people, so reservations are highly recommended.  We visited on a random Tuesday night around 830.  About 90% of the restaurant was full. Luckily, we had reservations.  We ordered the NY Strip with the Detroit zip sauce and the double boned pork chop, the nightly special.   The NY Strip was cooked perfectly.  And the Zip sauce you can get on the side....I can't say enough about that sauce. Butter, soy and array of other ingredients in there. So, so good.   The double bone pork chop was mouth watering. Served with roasted cauliflower, what a great pair.  Definitely will visit this place again and next time, I'll make it appoint to safe room for dessert.",

Then grab a drink at the bar with Levi. I've eaten dinner at the bar several times as well. His service and bartending skills are excellent. If you do go into the dining room ask for a booth. It's old school Vegas and request Miguel. The man makes a fantastic table side Caesar. I've had the ribeye several times and it has never disappointed but the last few times I've had the pasta dishes which had more of an Alfredo sauce with varying pastas and additions.   Super experience and although at the upper end of the price spectrum it's well worth it.",

    "text": "I wish I could go above 5 Stars because this restaurant gave us over 5 Star service. I did a lot of yelp research on Vegas steakhouses for my wedding. Of course you can go to the famous Chefs pricey steakhouses; but trust me; it is just a name. Andiamo's is a class, 5 star restaurant serving 5 star food for prices that are truly justified. The wide menu selection is amazing here, that you just will not find at other steakhouses. But above all else; the service was impeccable! Our server Sandy was absolutely amazing and went above and beyond what a server would do. We had a fairly large wedding group (10 people) at our table and every single person was catered to in every manner. All of our steak orders; along with the many sides; were perfectly cooked to each individuals order. NOTHING was messed up or overlooked. Sandy apparently has been at  Andiamo's for over 20 years and it shows! She absolutely loves her job and goes above making sure her clients have a fine dining experience.  We had come with a small wedding cake in a box that was placed beside us on the floor and never mentioned it. Sandy took it upon herself to ask us if we had a cake and took it up on a table in front of our guests and had us do a traditional cutting of the wedding cake! ( not to mention they brought their own congratulatory dessert for us and my son who was in his Marine Corp dress blues)She made our wedding truly a special day for all of us. Please,don't go to any other steakhouse in Vegas until you try Andiamo's first. You will never encounter a finer dining experience with both food and ALL staff then here. Thank you for giving us a beautiful day to remember always!",

Our wine, appetizer and beers were excellent, our meals were even more impressive.  The atmosphere was superb, staff at a 5plus star rate.  Miguel is a Gem and I hope his management shares this with him as he is a plus to the establishment.

Last year we tried Andiamo for the first time and loved it.  for this year's visit in May we booked a few activities on Fremont Street so we could include dinner at Andiamo.  This restaurant has become our favorite steak place in Vegas.  It is in the D Hotel/Casino and one would not imagine that this really top notch place is tucked away on the second floor.  It is hidden off the gambling floor and is in the style of an old fashioned Italian steak house.  I expect to see members of the Rat Pack dining there when I enter.  The staff is amazing.  Well informed as to the food and drinks and very classy in their dress and interaction with the diners.  The food is outstanding and the cost is reasonable considering the top service being provided.  I expect we will go to Vegas again next Spring and I expect Andiamo to be scheduled into our visit.  Go and enjoy this place!!",

    "text": "I had always been partial to Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse inside the Golden Nugget. I love it there so much I swore I'd never find a replacement - downtown or anywhere. Well, watch out Vic's. Adiamo's is giving you a serious run for your money.   This Italian steakhouse is located on the second level of the D Hotel & Casino. Just go up the escalators and hang a right. Walk down the dim hallway and enjoy a warm greeting from the friendly and professional hostess.   I was dining alone this evening, and heard the restaurant has a bar that also serves dinner there (Hugo's and Binions downtown will not serve food at their bars. It's solo-diner discrimination, I tell ya. Loners unite!).   It was about 9:30 pm on a Sunday evening and, having just flown in from Denver, I was quite hungry. Most of the restaurant was empty at this point. The bar, which consists of six seats, was completely empty. So I had my choice of seats. Yeah!  An extremely kind and professional server named Shannon welcomed me and handed over a menu. She was a nice \"upscale\" kind of server who still maintained a down-to-earth demeanor.   Oh speaking of the meal. It was outstanding! I ordered the filet mignon (medium) and a side of roasted potatoes. All were great. But be forewarned: the roasted potatoes are enough to feed a family. Maybe even an army. But they're very good and well-seasoned, so don't hesitate.   Shannon also brought over a basket of bread with a side of spread. This spread contained olives and eggplant - two of my favorite foods. So yeah, I liked that too. And it's complimentary, so what's not to like?   The atmosphere here is very decorative with a modern flair. It's dim, but not too dim. And the bar area is a more peaceful place at which to dine than, say Vic & Anthony's. This is due to its design. It's only open at one end, whereas Vic & Anthony's is open at both. As I sat there, I noticed that having only one open end cuts down on both noise and traffic, making for a more tranquil dining experience. Less clinking of utensils and dishware.   So my hats off to Andiamo's. It's slid into first place as my overall favorite downtown restaurant, and it beats the other steakhouses, too. That was a high bar to reach. Congrats to the D! This will become a big draw I'm sure.   Update 2014: Shannon no longer works there so you'll have to hunt for an equal professional. May check it out again on my next trip.",

The pasta for the veal papparadelle was impeccable--suuuuper fresh. And that bone in ribeye, medium rare, was just divine. No other words.",

It was perfect for our date night! Very romantic and intimate setting. Both me and my boyfriend ordered filet mignon and shared asparagus and whipped mashed potatoes. Everything was amazing! The steak was hands down the best steak either one of us had ever had. It was cooked perfectly. Very tender and juicy. The chef added this champagne butter sauce which set the steak over the edge! The sides are big enough to share between 2 or maybe even 3 people. The mashed potatoes were very creamy and the asparagus were phenomenal! The service was also amazing! I believe our waiters name was Jose and he was great!!! He always checked on us and even brought us out an eggplant spread and a small pasta dish prior to receiving our meal. It was very friendly, knowledgeable and professional. All the waiters spoke as they walked by and made sure that we didn't need anything. I love this place! I can't believe I've been in Las Vegas for so long without discovering it before! I will definitely be returning. 10/10 for sure!!!",

If you do to know where to go, you will not find it. It is to the right of the hotel escalators. There is a long dark hallway and you check in with the host.  Tip: You NEED reservations! The restaurant is not big at all so even the bar might be full.   We ordered the bone in rib eye and 2 sides, the sides to cost extra. About $10 a piece. We ordered the truffle mashed patties and fries (can you say carbs?)  The truffle mashed potatoes were to DIE for. I mean... I did die and went to truffle heaven. Very much worth the price. The fries were very tasty too.  But the meat, oh the meat. ODE to the cow that gave her/his life to provide this piece of herself to carnivore like ourselves.  We treated the meat with utter respect, we tasted, we closed our eyes, we were in heaven!  If you are looking for a TOP NOTCH restaurant, go here. It is beyond greatness.  The chef even brought us a complimentary side dish of angel pasta to try, and guess what? Angel pasta does its name justice. the sauce.. oh the sauce!  I am definitely spoiled now when it comes to Las Vegas and good restaurants.",

The serving staff is attentive to you as if you were the heir to the owner..or overseer, lol.   Joe Vicari's is also classy and and provides a unique menu with a slight Italian twist on the American steakhouse. Flavorful and rich are the words I would use to describe the various entrees and sides.

Our waiter was a ton of fun and added to a memorable evening for our celebration.  I wish I remembered his name! (He's pictured below and was awesome!) Our booth was great and although the restaurant was crowded, we were seated right away and it wasn't loud at all.    We had the table side Caesar which was awesome.  We all got various pasta dishes which ranged from average to delicious(I'm sorry I don't remember exactly which we got!). We shared two bottles of red wine, five entrees, two salads and received a free dessert in honor of our celebration which was a lovely touch(I had told them in advance we were celebrating).  Bill was $300 including tip.  Much less expensive than a similar dinner in the strip.    While I didn't live Fremont Street, I'd definitely consider a return trip to this restaurant.",

Next the famous table side Caesar salad.  Get xtra anchovies!  The entree's were a huge fruit de mare and the obvious mans choice bone in ribeye.  The fruit de mare had massive amounts of prawns, scallops,and clams in a savory tomato broth with hand made fettuccine.  This dish was amazing and honestly big enough to share.  The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a beurre blanc that made every bite special.  A complementary anniversary and birthday special of creme brulee topped off a wonderful evening.

    "text": "Las Vegas at its best. The service was incredible. I also really appreciated the vibe in the room. The tableside-made Caesar Salad was amazing. The restaurant's wine selection was top-notch as well. Per my doctor's instructions, I have some beef restrictions for three months so I enjoyed the veal. It was some of the best food I've had in my life! My friend who went with me had a nice steak. He really enjoyed his entree with the zip sauce! He said as far as steaks go, he said this one was very \"middle of the road,\" as he is quite a steak expert. He had the prime rib. But the zip sauce is a must! The desert desert selections were far ranging but rather average in taste. However our overall experience with this restaurant was very exemplary-a Vegas must! They were proud to say that they were number one on Trip Advisor, but when we checked they were actually number four of all restaurants in Vegas (which is remarkable). So there might be a little arrogance with their product, but they have big reason to be quite full of confidence!",

Who would think a top notch restaurant uses such a cheap ingredient, thus we didn't ask plus most steakhouses don't use it. They should definitely put it on the menu like most restaurants.  My problem is their lack of making it right.  I called the restaurant the next day after we got home and the manager called me back. He was very unhelpful. We wasted 35 bucks plus a nice evening. The least he could have done was comp us on our next visit. Nothing.  Maybe I'm asking too much but we won't be back bc of this. Sad bc the service was great as well as the Caesar salad.",

Although a steakhouse, you don't feel pressured to dress up. There are people dressed in nice suits and dresses and others in casual street-wear. The food is excellent and the service is exceptional. If you order the Caesar salad, they'll prepare it table side for you to see! I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a great time, great food, and great service.",

My steak was a little better this year, which is always good.  My wife's meatball was scrumptious.  The Caesar salad was great plus a nice bottle of champagne at a decent price.  I give the night an A-!    Note: this was far better than our meal at downtown competitor Vic and Anthony's.  A tad better than Ruth's' Chris and as good as our meal at Joe's.  Only a very surprising and exceptional meal at Mesa Grill was better all the way around on this trip.",

Steak fillet with special sause was much too salty , returned and not charged. On the overall we enjoyed the very professional and attentive waitstaff, and wish the cook would lay off the salt.",

    "text": "Klaniecki Wedding Dinner - 4/13/2017- One of the most important dinners of your life is your wedding dinner.  Our wedding party which included several guests arriving from several different states needed a place that could comfortably seat 15 people with great food and a fantastically cooked steak for the groom....that was no small feat. It also had to be well priced and include \"ambiance\" for a 7pm wedding dinner.  After researching several different places including online reviews, pictures of food and interior decor we decided on Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse. I started corresponding with the Manager and a very nice Associate in his office who was more than happy to work with us on a preset menu. The three course meal we decided on had several different options each person chose from including four entrees. The desert cart was well stocked with beautiful looking cakes and pies that were pleasing to the eye and delectable to the palate. The food was Phenomenal!  Let me say that again PHENOMENAL!!!!  I am not big on mixed drinks but found them flavorful especially the Old Fashion.  We (bride and groom) loved their Old Fashion cocktails.  You have not had an Old Fashion until you have tried one of theirs, its sets the bar, HIGH!   Our host, Miguel, was \"right on point\" and fully understood the term \"customer service.\"  The groom especially approved.   We THANK YOU Ken, Milli, Miguel and all others who supported you in making our wedding dinner a wonderful success for the Klaniecki Wedding Party on April 13, 2017.  It was greatly appreciated. Each year when we visit Vegas we will always stop in to your establishment for the best meal and customer service in town",

    "text": "This is the best Italian in Vegas I've had yet and I'm not surprised at all.  Andiamo was a solid spot for me to visit when I lived in Michigan because of the atmosphere, quality and reasonable pricing.  You definitely get all 3 over at The D.  The restaurant has a very small entrance at the top of the 2nd floor which opens up to the dining room.    We grilled our server on his favorite dishes, trying to find what he thought was \"excellent\" vs. \"good\".  I settled on the Potato Gnocchi w/ meat sauce as it is listed as the house specialty.  While the portion was a little smaller than I hoped, the quality of each potato stuffed bite was really good and the meat sauce was an excellent compliment.  Most of the pasta dishes are in the $20-30 range and are well worth the upgrade from other places around town in the $15-20 range.  The staff is very attentive and is dressed professionally and I noticed a Caesar salad being made table side across the room.  If you are looking for an upscale night out downtown, I highly reccomend it and look forward to trying more of the pasta dishes as well as their steak!",

It's located inside the D casino on Fremont street with no signage outside.  Use valet parking for the D. Attire is business casual but a dress code isn't enforced.  I suggest reservations.  Seated with no wait on a busy Friday night.  Started with the Salami & Cheese appetizer which was absolutely amazing.  Unique taste with plenty of variety.  Our entrees included Veal Osso Bucco, The Veal Chop special, Lobster Risotto,  and Tortellaci Giuseppe.  I can't say enough about the portion size; well worth the price.  The veal entrees were huge.  The Lobster Risotto and Veal were the best we ever had.  Spectacular service by Hugo our waiter.  There were some families with children but I'd leave the kids home.  This is an adult restaurant for special occasions.  My only suggestion for management is to expand the choice of pasta entrees.",

    "text": "What an amazing addition to downtown dining.  I ended up here for a work meeting on Wednesday night because the lighting at nearby Vic & Anthony's is far too dim to read by.  I made a reservation for 3, and despite arriving a little late, we were seated right away.  The privacy we requested was easily accommodated by the big booth that basically encloses your group.  The lighting was much better than Vic's and we were able to review documents and discuss work without any interruptions.  We did manage to enjoy ourselves though.    Now let's talk about the goods.  Service was flawless from start to finish.  Our waiter looked like he stepped out of the pages of a Little Italy tour book.  He was authentic Italian New Yorker and very helpful.  When we asked for antipasto suggestions, he recommended the sausage and peppers.  I would never have ordered this otherwise, and this dish was amazing!  Spicy grilled peppers, onions and homemade sausage.  Had a great spiciness that was tempered by the sweetness of the peppers.  I had the tableside Caesar salad (2 people must order), mainly because I just love seeing anything prepared at the table.  In addition to the fun presentation, the salad was probably one of the best caesars I've ever had.  Instead of chopping up the romaine, you get full romaine leaves which are tossed in the homemade dressing (made right in front of you) and the croutons are very fresh.  Definitely a must.    For my entree, I had the 8 oz filet.  It was perfectly cooked, but by this point, I had to box half of it because I was stuffed.  We also ordered the truffled potatoes as a side dish.  I thought they were incredibly rich, but delicious.  Wonderful experience.  At the risk of being struck by lightning, if you are in the neighborhood, I may have to recommend Joe Vicari's over Hugo's Cellar.",

    "text": "My husband and I are \"locals\" (we've lived here about a year now), and we joined 10 other people who were visiting, for a special dinner at Andiamo. We had wanted to try an upscale steakhouse, and were pleased that the group decided on this one, as we've heard good things about it.  First of all, the venue is wonderful, kind of retro 'speakeasy' type elegance. And its not too loud to enjoy the company you are with.  Considering how big our party was, I have to say that the service was marvelous. Every order came out in timely fashion (nobody was left waiting while others ate), and every order was correct. Mergim (I hope I got his name right!), our Albanian-American waiter, had two assistants to help him serve us all. Other than being a bit slow to refill water glasses, the whole service was perfect. It was a wonderful, leisurely, conversation-filled dining experience. Being such a large group, we tried most of the menu items. The assorted meats & cheeses and the sausage & peppers were standout appetizers, as was the assortment of breads. The lobster bisque was \"to die for\", and the Caesar salad was authentic.  I didn't think the little dish of pasta (vodka-tomato sauce over angel hair) that came out between appetizers and main courses was anything special; but the others liked it. The king crab legs were opened by a waiter, so the person who ordered those didn't have to struggle with them.  The steaks came out with a wonderful surface char, and everybody said theirs was done exactly as ordered. Don't forget to order their \"zip\" sauce to dip your meat into! Strange name, but a rich, buttery stock that complements red meat perfectly. Skip banal sides like shoestring potatoes, and go for standouts such as the huge moist meatballs, or the lobster mac-and-cheese (it had huge chunks of lobster meat!).  We even got a free dessert for the birthday guy (kit kat tiramisu--we all got a bite)! When we split the bill, it came to about $90 a person, including alcoholic drinks. I believe that is pretty reasonable for one of these class of steakhouses, considering all the dishes we ordered. The food, the service, and the ambience could not be beat.  My only regret was that nobody else in our party wanted to linger for more desserts, because I've heard great things about those too. Oh well...my husband and I will be back for our next \"special\" occasion dinner!",

If you make a reservation I would recommend of of the booths as they lend to a more private and intimate dinner.   The wine list is sizable,  but no real standouts. The food is great. They do a table side caesar salad,  delicious,  but if you're a vampire skip this one. I had the lobster risotto it was awesome. The seafood pasta is enormous and tasty.

    "text": "There were many fine Yelp reviews for Andiamo, yet they STILL managed to exceeded my high expectations. The Food: Steaks are great here.  I don't eat meat, but I still appreciate the effort they go to serve a wonderful cut.  Wet and dry aging for 6 weeks, cut at the restaurant (not before delivery), and other quality controls, were savored by our guests.  Our waiter explained that \"Medium\" was seared outside, with a band of pink, not raw, in the middle.  The Fillet was exactly as described.  Delicious. Seafood:  Daily flown in from around the world.  None is more than one day old.  They have an impressive variety of choices.  (This is a STEAKHOUSE!?) The Cioppino was filled with squid, octopus, mussels, clams, tuna, and 1/2 a lobster tail.  The broth was a reduction sauce that was almost painfully rich in flavor. Our table also enjoyed the scallops and the Chilean Sea Bass.  The latter was on a bed of tiny mushrooms with long stems and small heads.  We asked the waiter what type of mushroom is this?  \"Wild mushrooms.\"  Where are they from?  \"Farmed here in Las Vegas.\"  If they are farmed, they can't be wild.  \"Everything in Las Vegas is wild.\" We were served a complementary small plate of pasta with a cheese blended tomato sauce; fabulous!  No doubt, Andiamo does a great pasta. And the tapenade with grilled Baguette slices was chunky goodness. Cocktails are generous, coffee was rich, as were the deserts. The Ambiance: Valet was available, and prompt.  The D's casino is populated with many T-shirt wearing customers; just ignore them.  We sat in a private feeling, circular high backed sofa, with a domed fabric canopy.  Very intimate. The Service: This is where Andiamo shines!  Miguel, our waiter, was \"old school.\"  He was knowledgeable about the entire menu, attentive to our needs, followed up with us throughout the meal at just the right times, and he accommodated our special requests perfectly.  As other Yelpers noted, service is exemplary! We even had the opportunity to meet the corporate executive chef; Jim, from Detroit.  He was working on the night of his 6th wedding anniversary, while his wife was credit carding.  Anyway, Jim told the history of the company.  They have 23 restaurants in Detroit, with Andiamo being their first in Vegas.  The restaurant owner, Joe Vicari, and the D's owners go way back.  Dining at Andiamo, you can feel how important it is for the restaurant to be spectacular, to help make the D a success.  But I also can tell they want to wow us customers.  The service at Andiamo is like at Commander's Palace in New Orleans, just without the white gloves. Special events: Jim gave us a preview of an upcoming 7 course meal/wine pairing; date to be announced.  I mentioned that my wife and I do not eat meat or poultry, just vegetarian or fish.  Jim said no problem, give him a call and he will make sure we have a great experience.  Some restaurants are willing to modify their menu a course or two, some refuse entirely.  When I dine, it comes out of my entertainment budget; so great service is really appreciated, but rarely done, let alone done this well. Value:  Steaks and seafood entrees run aprox. $40.  (Check out the menu online.)  Lobster bisque (super rich!) was $8, as were most appetizers/salads.  All the salads were better than other high class restaurants, and Miguel made the BEST table side Caesar salad ever!  We had cocktails, coffee, split a desert, for less than $300 for four persons.  The pasta dishes are less than $30, and I am sure very delicious.  We brought home most of our entrees for tomorrow; like pasta shells, that night we were stuffed!",

    "text": "This place was a big deception and significantly over-rated in my opinion, especially if one factors in the cost.  The food is OK, nothing to die for nor even sustain a minor injury for.  My friend, my wife and myself dined there on a recent Friday night.  We shared a bottle of wine and each had a steak - two medium filet mignons and one bone-in ribeye, which my wife said was overly fatty.  For sides we had a plate of spinach (more on this in a minute), a very average baked potato, and some roasted potatoes  I also had a small dinner salad. My friend had a small desert pastry and a cup of coffee at the end..  Total Tab = $300!!!  Oh my!  Where did these 4-5 star ratings come from???  When ordering, the stuffed shirt of a waiter convinced us to get a bottle of wine instead of the three of us ordering glasses of the same type.  His argument was that you get an extra glass and its a much better deal.  The bottle of wine was $76 - my bad for not asking the price but it turned out to be no cheaper per/glass than by ordering by the glass.  The waiter deceptively upsold that bottle of wine to us.  When ordering the sides,I told him that I wanted a little spinach too and he assured me that three teaspoon-sized portion (no exaggeration) that my friend had ordered would serve us all, easily.  Not even close.  In retrospect, at the prices they were charging I should be thankful that we did not order more spinach!  That plate of spinach would not even feed a bloated rabbit after a three-course meal - It was a joke and I believe they were getting $9.00 for that.  Regret that I did not take a picture of the portion.  I've had steak dinners at Outback Steakhouse that were at least as good and for a LOT LESS MONEY than this place.   It is way overly-pretentious (and also a total disconnect from the dumpy hotel that it is in), mostly average and extremely overpriced.  Don't say you have not been warned!",

The two star deductions are for two reasons, namely the staff is incredibly slow and inattentive, and the entree's were way, way too salty. If they cut down on the salt and become more selective in choosing their staff, then there is no reason this place wouldn't get five stars, as the flavor is there.",

    "text": "I was very excited about the opening of Andiamo. As a downtown resident, I love when new businesses open up here, but I thought this could be a game changer....and I was right.  We have (now) 3 high end steakhouses down here...VVIc & Anthony's, Oscars, and Andiamo.  I've always found Oscar's kind of gimmicky, while I love  V&A's. But this place is one or two notches above.  It has a hip vibe (2013 hip, not 1940s hip). We were greeted nicely and seated immediately in a booth that may as well have been a private room, what with the 7 foot high banquette forming 335 degrees of a circle.  Service was quick and spectacular....observant but not obsequious. Caesar was made table side, and the fresh anchovies gave just the right of bite. The steaks are spectacular..I'm not sure how they age them, and who their purveyor is, but they rank very, very high in flavor and tenderness.  As my wife isn't a wine drinker, I didn't pay much attention to the by-the-bottle list, but the by-the-glass selections were all fantastic. My only complaint is that they had no Zins by the glass, so I settled for a beautiul Cab.  The deserts goiing by on the cart (repeatedly) looked gorgeous, so we had to splurge. We had a creme brulee (let's face it a well done brulee is a well done brulee...there's only so far you can go) a dessert called \"Kit Kat\" which is a homemade, delicious version of the execrable candies, and the most amazing chocolate cake with ganache frosting   No dish failed to live up to expectation...and no dish faled to surpass expectation.  THe food, ambiance and service were all top-notch,  I for one welcome the newcomer to the block.",

    "text": "My partner and I go to Vegas several times a year, and most recently have been staying Downtown, eschewing the corporate glitz of the Strip for a more old-school Vegas experience (and better video poker pay tables!).  We've been pretty happy with how The D has been taking care of us, and read some reviews for Andiamo since we were going to be staying there again.  The reviews were pretty positive, including some good reviews from the local press.  Last Saturday, we arrived shortly after 5pm for an early dinner after skipping lunch.  The place definitely has a throwback elegance to it-- think dark wood paneling, tall leather booths, and dim lighting.  We were seated straight away.  We were so lucky to have Joan as our waiter (pronounced yo-AN), a Romanian expatriate who's been in the restaurant biz since his teen years.  For those of you that truly appreciate a real professional, Joan is the real deal.  So much of what made this meal such a great experience was his attention, expertise, and professionalism.  One of the best-- this guy is a treasure.  The menu is extensive, and Joan augmented it with the list of the nights specials; we sipped some Tanquerey and perused the menu.  We got some delicious in-house made bread, served with a great tapenade (a nice change of pace from the usual oil and vinegar or cold bricks of butter).  For our first course we had the calamari (very fresh, lightly fried up and served with a zippy marinara) and the Caesar salad.    This is REAL Caesar salad, made tableside with impeccably fresh ingredients-- egg yolks, anchovy fillets, the works.  I've found that finding a real Caesar salad is something of a task, and this is the best I've had.  The balance of the creamy egg to the umami-laden anchovy, the Dijon, the Worchestershire, the cheese-- all perfect.  I could eat that salad every night.  We decided on the specials-- Joe ordered the Sea Bass on a fried pea risotto cake, and I got the special cioppino (not the one on the menu).  The Sea Bass was top shelf, beyond fresh and cooked perfectly.  It was a very generous cut of fish, he couldn't  finish the accompanying fritter (though, the impromptu pasta course that came out compliments of the chef before the main courses probably had something to do with that).  The cioppino was stellar and chock full of quality seafood, namely the two large langoustines that were in the center of the bowl.  The langoustines were amazing, and accompanied by a slew of clams and mussels, prawns, crab, fish, and two very important slices of deliciously salty grilled bread for the broth.  Seriously fantastic-- I've not had better.    We sadly did not have room to sample the dessert offerings, but that just gives us something to look forward to for next time.  We will definately be back, as long as Joan is working that night!  Try it-- after too many disappointing meals on the Strip, we are glad we gave this place a try and found a real gem!",

My date got the Cosmo which was also very good. I orderd the rack of lamb and she got the porterhouse, we split the sides of the mashed potatoes and the asparagus. Both the side were DELICIOUS!!! our Entrees were both cooked to perfection and both amazing. Our food was excellent, the service was excellent, the drinks were excellent!

    "text": "Outstanding dining experience !!  My wife and I were on our annual Vegas golf vacation, and we decided  we would dress up a little and have our anniversary dinner at a really nice restaurant.  Andiamo was highly recommended to us, so we made our reservations for 7 pm on a Friday night.  When we arrived, we were a few minutes early but got seated right away with no problem at all.  Again, this was 7pm on a Friday night and we had no wait whatsoever.  Most places, even with reservations, there is a little wait, but not here.  The ambience is terrific, nice and quiet, even a little romantic.   Sandy, our server, was wonderful!    She made us feel welcome, gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu without feeling rushed.    My wife had the agnolotti and I had the swordfish, and we both agreed that our dishes were absolutely delicious.   The courses were brought to us in a nicely-timed manner, allowing us to savor our food and not feel as though we had to hurry.   We never had to ask for refills on water, as the staff was on the ball with the pitchers.   I had a glass of chardonnay that was just right, and my wife was equally happy with her merlot.    Dessert and coffee topped off an exquisite meal.    And when the tab came, it was a pleasant surprise, because even though we were prepared to spend quite a bit for a very special 5th anniversary dinner,  the tab was well under what we were prepared to pay for such a wonderful meal.    I highly recommend Andiamo.   In fact, it may just become our \"go to\" place for any future anniversaries we spend in Vegas.",

We scored one of their stylish, enclosed, chocolate leather booths with dim lighting. The overall service was terrific, our server was fast,  tremendously efficient and kind! Sadly, my food did not merit  4+ stars. -Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes $25 great portion size, moist and delicious! By far the best item ordered!!!! -Lobster Bisque $12 mediocre soup with a tablespoon of lobster \"crumbs\". -Calamari Fritti- $15 meh.  Caesar Salad $12 the table side preparation was kind of neat!  -Lobster Risotto $36 I can't recall ever sending a meal back to the kitchen until this evening. My friends and I agreed of all the food ordered this was by far the worst dish ever! The \"lobster meat\" was extremely over cooked and tough. I honestly can't even describe the risotto; it was just that bad.  -Lobster-Black Truffle Baked Ziti $16 I was way to busy chugging water after sampling my disgusting pasta I neglected to try the ziti. The portion is HUGE definitely shareable. My friend was extremely dissatisfied with her ziti. After a few bites she gave up due to the extremely fishy lobster taste.  My other friend ordered some special seafood pasta of the day. She loved it and it was her birthday so I guess that's a win!   $190+ Tip First & Last Here!!",

    "text": "We have been waiting to try this place for some time so our 8 top of hungry traveling guys head downtown to the 'D\" in old  Las Vegas at the recommendation of so many.  Arrive to the D the old Fitzgeralds Hotel which as been redone but it's still old \"SEEDY\" vegas as we  go to the top of the elevator and right next to the bathroom it seems is along hall with brick entering this very elegant dining establishment.    Place is steak house modern with a throwback feel to some extent as we arrive to a nice table inside a curtain which makes it feel private.   Menu is a mix of Italian - heavy on the Various steaks and they are not shall we say light on price points.   Servers arrive with complimentary very good chopped marinated eggplant and decent bread with dipping oils and whipped butter.    Wine list is really one of the most REASONABLE priced lists I've seen in a long time as it pertains to high end restaurants especially in Vegas.   Order two different reds which are both decanted prior to being served very classy.   Move on to food and Appetizers come out VERY QUICKLY .. will simply do the list below.   Wedge Salads with Blue Cheese, sliced red onion and egg are authentic and absolutely delicious.   Shrimp Cocktail well they are fine, nothing special.   Escarole with sausage is outstanding  Italian Sausage & Peppers with Marinara base also a big hit at the table.   Where do things go a little south well the Steaks especially for the price points were disappointing.   Various cuts of meat were tried Rib Eye -  NY Strip Filet Mignon  All of them were good don't get me wrong  but there are cuts of prime beef then there are well disappointing cuts of prime beef.   Their char was non existent and they simply did not get the job done and when your are talking about steaks at 60$ plus per steak they better ring the bell.   With that said sides of baked potato, asparagus and fingerling potatoes with onions were simply fare.      Complimentary platter of pasta in pink sauce thank you for the platter but pasta was over cooked and sauce \"PINK\" very bland.   2 tiramisu for the table were excellent.   Quite a bit of wait between entrees and appetizers, not servers fault as they were TOP SHELF all night.   Sorta in the wow how can this steakhouse disappoint you when everything else was so good?   Not sure but I certainly feel 3 stars is accurate with these price points for beef.    Was. Decent but at these prices in this location going to have to pass in the future.",

    "text": "Come to Vegas and you'll easily be able to find a Yelp $$$$ establishment. The amount of chefs and gourmet spots is never ending. But what if you don't want something insanely pricy? What if you still want a decent steak? What if you left the Vegas Strip? Well, you might find Joe Vicari's, and if you did, you'd be pleasantly surprised and superbly satisfied.  I mean you may have to do some serious searching (or use *ahem* Yelp) to find this place. Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse is well hidden inside The D Hotel and Casino along the infamous Fremont Street in Downtown Las Vegas. Follow the signs and sift through the slots and you'll stumble upon one of the coolest entrances to a restaurant. A curved brick hallway with a classy feel leads right into a realm of True service and taste.  There's an old world Italian vibe with a pang of contemporary comfort and style that makes this place a perfect spot to host almost any event (like my father's B-day). Another perfect? The service. I can't say enough how on point our server Miguel was throughout the evening (and how often he made us laugh). He also threw together an incredible Caesar salad, made table side. You heard me right. Forget about table side guac! Once you try this you'll be sold.  Beyond the salad is a menu filled with excellent Italian cuisine and some superb steaks. Half of my family went pasta while the other half chose the cow. I was a pasta man and my choice was \"Paglia e Fieno\" which took egg and spinach linguine and and threw chicken, prosciutto, peas and a white wine cream sauce on top of it. Lovely tender chicken pieces and enough of a balance of flavors that the dish never felt too rich. Mom dined on pasta as well choosing one that included beef tenderloin tips (really tasty) while my sis got a petite filet mignon that cut like butter. Our father rocked the house with a mini (it didn't look mini!) tomahawk steak that was cooked beautifully and was accompanied by some delicious house made gnocchi. We barely spoke while we ate unless we were raving about each dish.  Two other little edible items I don't want to forget to mention, as they make Joe Vicari's stand out even more than it already does. First, the \"compliments of the chef\" capellini in a light tomato cream sauce that is given to all who order a steak. And second, the bread. Okay, the bread was great but it was more the spreading (sorry, I forgot the proper Italian name for it) that comes on the side. Let's just say once you try it, you'll scoff at butter and oil the next time you go out to an Italian restaurant. Oh, and the tiramisu! Once I saw the size of the piece I had to make that happen. Creamy and dreamy and a perfect ending to the meal.  Overall, Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse is excellent. That's a simple statement and one which is entirely True. Maybe it won't be the cheapest meal you have in Vegas, but you could easily spend so much more on The Strip. Instead of doing that, forget Wolfgang Puck or Gordon Ramsey and take a trip to Downtown to find Joe Vicari. You won't be disappointed.",

Andiamo's is in a hotel (just grab the escalator outside on Fremont Street) and you will arrive at Andiamo's. When you walk in you are greeted by wonderful people, the restaurant is lovely, and peaceful. All of the tables are nice and the seating is comfortable.  We started with crab cakes and they were fantastic, and we are picky about our crab cakes. We moved onto steak dinners, a filet cooked to perfection, rare and delicious and a tomahawk steak which was huge and was simply great. All of the items are wonderful, we have been more than once.  I suggest making a reservation and if you can get a booth that is nice, but all the seating, as I said, is wonderful.  You are especially going to love the outstanding service, from the host to each server and bus person. They are all great.   They also have a nice selection and a full bar.  Have a great dinner.",

He is an attentive, professional who really helps create a lasting impression of the restaurant.   The Andiamo's dining room is a sumptuous space, with recessed tray ceilings painted silver, interesting lighting fixtures, and rich high leather booths. We ate at a large table in the center of the room, but the combination of various screens, curtains, and recessed booths around us actually made it feel like we were on our own.   The food is rich, and the steaks deliver.   The table side caesar salad preparation is a must, and the use of whole anchovies and raw egg yolk, crisp croutons and whole romaine leaves make the quality of the dish as impressive as the presentation.   Highly recommended is the portobello mushroom appetizer. I think the house-made \"zip sauce\" is put to best use there. The steaks themselves hold up on their own and do not need the dressing.",

It's one thing to memorize the special and the ingredients but he was explaining it with such gusto, I was tempted to buy each and everything he mentioned.  The portion sizes are more than generous so keep that in mind and share, like my wife and I.   Miguel recommended the Caesar salad that is prepared tableside but we didn't. We did get to see another couple get it and it looked amazing.  Miguel, we're definitely coming back again during our next visit and we hope to see you soon!",

However, the show we saw got done early so we walked in at 10pm and asked if we could be seated, and we promptly were.  The server took awhile to come over, which was alright as we could tell they were very busy for the evening. The server was attentive and helpful when we asked how much food to order.  The kale salad we started with was delicious, however I felt they were a bit skimpy with the toppings, but overall good.  That's where us liking the food ended. My boyfriend and I ordered a filet medium rare and they steak that came out was over cooked. It was a medium in the middle and medium well on the sides. We thought about sending it back but didn't want to wait for them to make a new one. The signature sauce on the steak however was delicious. We also ordered a shrimp diablo pasta, and surprise, the shrimp were so over cooked they were inedible. I did however enjoy the pasta itself and the sauce was very good. For dessert I had the Spumoni, which wasn't nearly as authentic as I had hoped for an Italian steakhouse. It was over frozen, almost freezer burned, and I couldn't taste the cherry if there was any. Almost looked like vanilla, pistachio and chocolate to me but I couldn't be sure.   My boyfriend asked to pay in bitcoin, which this restaurant is known for, and due to technical issues was unable to.   All in all it wasn't the worst experience and the service was attentive, but it wasn't the best either. I doubt my boyfriend and I will return.",

Service: Fantastic from beginning to end.  Drinks were always fresh, and table was always ready for the upcoming course.  Our waitress was fantastic!  So friendly and very sweet and knew her stuff.   Great recommendations!  She definitely enhanced our dining experience.  Food: They offered a prime rib special and it was one of the best decisions I've made all year.  20+ ounces of medium rare blissfulness.  Prepped and cooked perfectly, best prime rib I've had in 2017 easily.  It's my current screen saver on my phone, but I digress.  We got warmed up with the pork shoulder and it was very tasty.  All the following sides were made with high end ingredients that kept the flavors rich: Escargot. mushrooms, asparagus tips and the whipped potatoes.  Did I mention that the Prime Rib was lovely? Separation anxiety kicking in..  Ambiance: High End old school steakhouse decor with lots of bricks, wood and leather around.  The brick tunnel entrance with runway lights was very cool.  High end utensils and plates made it easy to enjoy the food.  Dimly lit to keep the mood intimate but social.  Noisy because the place is packed but not overbearing.  Great place to start a \"dress up\" evening out.  I'm already looking forward to the next yummy visit.  This is a great steakhouse to celebrate a special dinner and is now a go to for $$$ restaurants in the downtown area.  The team I went with were all carnivore alpha+  eaters and everyone enjoyed the steaks they ordered.  Andiamo gives your the VIP experience with the service and the food.  Highly recommended, and I'm hoping the Prime Rib special is available next visit.  Did I mention how bomb it was?  =)",

We made reservations and they were well accommodating as well. We had steak most of us and my sister had lamb chops when I tell you everything tasted delicious. Truffle potatoes, asparagus was great and that was my first time trying it and was really good. I also tried oysters as well it was good. I have nothing bad to say. Nice and quiet ambiance. Service was great, really attentive and made sure our needs were met.steaks were juicy and well seasoned just all round amazing. I have nothing bad to say, Nothing. If you are in town especially vegas please stop by the D and enjoy a great dinner.",

I had the prime rib, which was soaked in au jus. Plain and simple yet perfectly tender and flavorful. The Italian wedding soup is also fantastic.  The atmosphere is wonderful for a romantic dinner. Dimly lit, spotless white tablecloths and server uniforms, brick walls, and no detail unaccounted for.

First off..we had a very nice table in a very crowded restaurant. our server was over the top good....offering suggestions..mixing our salads tableside...a real pro. We were all disappointed with the quality of the food and the outrageous prices charged. First off..my Manhattan was $18....and it was insanely small. Waiter brought over a cup of ice to make it look bigger? my sons old fashioned was bigger and better..my wife's pinot was fine. We each had the Caesar salad...$33 for 3 people. it was good but...Wife had the salmon ravioli and said it was very salty. my son had the porterhouse...said it was \"stringy\" but flavorful. I had the rib eye and just kept thinking that for the $48 price..it wasn't the  best cut. Our sides of white truffle mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach were good. I just kept thinking that this place is living off their laurels of five star reviews. I'm in the minority..so what the heck do I know??",

    "text": "Having been a frequent guest at The D since they opened, I've always wanted to eat at Andiamo, I listen to a few Vegas podcasts and this steakhouse always gets great reviews. But this place is not cheap, a real destination dining sort of thing, and for many years we went to the strip and ate at places like Gordon Ramsey's Steak, Bobby Flay's place, or Giada, because the prices are about the same as dinner at Andiamo, even though we always stay at The D. This past Memorial Day weekend, my wife and I were playing a few slots really late \"before we turn in\", and she won a $1400 bonus. The problem was this was like 3:30 am and because such a win requires lots of authentication and tax documents, it was 4:15 before we could go up to our room. That was when I made her promise that she would take us out to dinner finally at Andiamo with her winnings the next night. Well, the next night was Memorial Day, it was tricky to get reservations, but $20 tip got us in at 7:30. The restaurant was packed, with white jacketed waiters and wine slingers running all about the small space. Our waiter greeted us, gave us a little spiel, took drink orders, and then brought out the bread and chutney that each table gets. In the time we were waiting for him to return to take our entree orders we were watching the table adjacent to us place their orders with their white-jacketed waiter.     Before I knew what was going on, my wife grabbed my arm and started saying \"Oh My God, Oh My God\", pointing out the back of the waiter not 7 feet from our table. Unbeknownst to him, a large 2 inch cockroach was climbing from his right hip, across his jacket, to his head, then on to the top of the banquette where the party of six was ordering. We saw the poor diners notice this at this point, the waiter became shockingly aware, and the party was immediately re-seated never to be seen by us again. Shortly thereafter someone I assumed was a wait captain came up and asked my wife what was going on. She told him what we had just witnessed, and he apologized. No other tables near or around us, miraculously, noticed what had happened.      When our bill came, we were charged full price for everything, there was no apology from the waiter upon presenting the bill, nothing. Listen, no one expects a free meal at a very expensive steakhouse just because you see a 2 inch cockroach crawl all over the waitstaff and then onto the seating area of your neighboring diners, but to not give us some sort of discount, or sending out a dessert or something, I thought was in poor form.       Steaks, delicious by the way, really good. But tainted of course by the insect invasion and total ignoring of our shocking dining experience by Andiamo staff. If they would have even comped our two vodka drinks, I might never had even taken the last hour to post this. Plus, it's been months since Memorial Day, but as busy as I have been I didn't wanna let this one get by without a review.",

I had the house salad and it was chopped up very small with a lite dressing. My wife had the wedge salad and it was huge and very good. My mom had the chopped salad and it was a good size and also very tasty. I had the porterhouse and it was cooked perfectly. The strip and filet sides were perfect and tasty. My mom had the filet and asked them to butterfly it as she likes it cooked medium well. Steak was done to her liking. My wife had veal ravioli and they were really good. Sauce was a little rich but very tasty. For sides we had asparagus and French fries. The asparagus had a sauce or something on them, was good but couldn't place the flavor. We were thinking about dessert but they only have 1 dessert tray I guess cause it took so long we had to just get the check because we had show tickets next door. Overall a great meal with great service and ambiance",

He is a professional server by trade (having worked for some of the best and most famous chefs all over the world), and his flair and knowledge can't be beat.  Everything that we ordered from the lovely shiraz to his personal suggestions was spot on and delicious.  I have been fortunate enough to have dined at fine steakhouses all over the country, and the filet with zip sauce at Andiamo cannot be beat; I'm still dreaming about that crusty char.  The agnolotti pasta was tender and delicious in a creamy spinach sauce with truffles and wild mushrooms, stuffed with delicate veal.  It does not look like a large plate, but after snacking on the lovely breadstick/crostini and tapenade appetizer and the silky lobster bisque, I couldn't finish it.  We were too stuffed for dessert but the multi-tiered cart looked phenomenal; I will have to try to maintain some self-control so that I can try one next time!",

Everything was so damn good and as my husband and I were leaving the restaurant we decided that we MUST eat here every single time we go to Vegas now.  We went for our 5 year wedding anniversary and we let the restaurant know that when we made our reservation. Our waiter wished us a happy anniversary and was such a nice and friendly person. We found out at the end of our meal that they gave us our appetizer for FREE and gave us a FREE dessert! Our waiter thanked my husband for his military service and talked with us a little bit about his cousin who is in the service. Very nice person!!!  Now the food... We got the gigantic meatball as an appetizer and it was so perfectly perfect. The flavor was so damn good and the meatball was juicy with perfect seasoning and texture. LOVE. For entrees we got a seafood pasta and steak. The pasta was amazing and creamy and the tomahawk ribeye steak was....listen. I consider myself a steak connoisseur. This steak was the best steak I've ever had in my life. I am not lying to you. It was cooked exactly how I wanted it (medium rare) and had the perfect amount of delicious salty char crust. I told my husband that I didn't want to keep eating the steak because that meant that I would eventually finish it and it would be gone...lol! I seriously dream about this steak.  Anyways, the point is: you need to GO HERE!!!!!! Get the ribeye, a pasta dish, and the meatball appetizer share everything and you will not be sorry. You will be extremely full and all other steak restaurants will be ruined for you but you will not at all be sorry!!",

The restaurant is not what you expect when you walk into the D Casino, its a pleasant surprise.    The atmosphere of Andiamo is cozy and inviting, we were seated in a circular booth which was huge for the two of us.  The servers were very attentive but not overly checking up on us.    We shared an appetizer of the fried mozzarella balls (not sure it was called this on the menu) and i enjoyed the sauce it was sitting in.  i'm not really a fan of fried moz but the tomato sauce had olives in it and i loved the flavor.  the husband did not like the olives and ate all the mozz.  it was a nice tradeoff.  For the entree the husband had filet mignon and i had the branzino.  If you are a fish lover go for the branzino!  so tender with a mild lemon and sage flavor and the saute chickpea and peppers beneath the fish was delicious!  overall the experience was great and I would go back again!",

You'll see a theme here, as much of the experience was OK.   The bread was good. I liked the breadsticks.   We ordered the house salad, kale salad, and shrimp cocktail. The house salad was a lot of lettuce with a dash of oil and some garbanzo beans. Bland and boring. The kale salad was good and flavorful. The shrimp were OK. The type of shrimp you'd expect at a lesser place. At $5/ shrimp, I want the large, white, flavorful shrimp. They missed here.   Three of us ordered filets, with one of us adding the lobster tail, and one of us ordered the salmon. The steaks were very good. Cooked properly and tasty. The sauce that came on them is there signature sauce, and it was as delicious as the waiter told us it would be. The lobster tail was very good too. The baked potatoes were of poor quality, but the roasted potatoes and onions were tasty.   Desserts were OK.   In a nutshell, this experience was OK. Our bill with a modest bottle of wine was $400 plus tip. We're happy to spend top dollar for a great meal. $100/ person for an OK meal is a bit disappointing. With so many amazing choices we have in Las Vegas, we will likely not be returning.",

The service, ambience, and of course the steaks all come together to put Andiamo at the top.  The Tomahawk, the porterhouse, and the prime rib on the weekends are excellent.  My server Miguel always makes me feel welcome.",

    "text": "So very disappointed by the food here.  The ambiance was classy, quiet and sophisticated.  The service by our waiter and his supporting cast members was top notch.  Refills frequent, unobtrusive plate clearing and prompt bill delivery all made the experience above average on the service front.  The food.  Meh.  Not even on par with the chain steakhouses.  We had a party of seven and were seated promptly at the time of our reservation.  Two of us started with the Caesar salad, to be prepared table side.  We were in an alcove, with a very large party just outside, so our waiter explained, when delivering the salads, that the table side preparation wasn't possible due to the space constraints.  Salad was huge romaine leaves, sharp, pungent shreds of Parmesan cheese and a very bland dressing, devoid of any identifiable flavors.  Two in our party ordered the roast chcken, which was served in a red wine sage sauce, which they reported to be delish.  The chicken, however, was overcooked, dry and flavorless.  Disappointment for both.  Hubby just got the oysters on the half-shell appetizer as he wasn't that hungry.  Said they were ok; however, later that night he appeared to have gotten food poisoning and was ill the next 24 hours.  Not sure where it came from, but this is a possibility.  Two in our party ordered the filet mignon, with zip sauce.  No idea what is in the zip sauce but it added nothing to the flavor.  For $39 it was not something that was amazing enough to order again.    I opted for the chopped steak, with zip sauce.  I normally don't expect a huge \"meat eating steak experience\" when ordering this entree, and that's what I got.  There was pieces of gristle ground into the patty, and once I encountered two or three, I was done....grossed out and done!  Can't remember what the last person ordered, but again, it was unremarkable.  As we were with several guests we had never met, I was not comfortable sharing our disappointment with the manager as we left.  I intended to email my concerns upon my return; however, I cannot locate a contact email address for this establishment.  If you are looking for a semi-fancy, relaxed pace dining experience, this place delivers.  If you desire an above average culinary experience, make another choice.",

Steak, Seafood, Pasta,  Asparagus, Potatoes, desert, coffees all awesome!  We didn't have a single weak dish.  Fantastic prep and seasonings.  Excellent wines to choose from both by the glass and bottle, which complement the food well.  The location at the corner of Fremont in The D makes for a fun after-dinner stroll.

    "text": "I can't believe it has taken me so long to write a review about this place.  As I write this review the word PHENOMENAL keeps repeating in my mind.  I live in southern California, yet I make it a point to dine at this place any time I am in Vegas.  We have great dining options in San Diego County, yet we always reserve a special dinner for Andiamo.  What makes Andiamo so special?  Customer service is the first reason that comes to mind.  John was our server the first time we dined here and did a great job.  We had the pleasure of Carl helping guide our second meal here and have made it a point that he takes the reins of every dining adventure at Andiamo since then.  With his knowledge and passion for food and wine Carl has the ability to make our dinner an epic one.  Impeccable service, a great sense of humor and an attitude that makes us feel comfortable and welcome.  The hostesses Roxanna and Elma are always sweet and very accommodating, even when our party is running late.  The manager Ulisis makes it a point to visit with us at least once every meal.  Now for the tasty treats that encourage us to eat until it hurts...  Drinks: Great wine list with enough variety to accommodate anyone.  Bottles 212, 234 and 226 were very good.  Appetizers were great.  The fresh bread with eggplant caponata is a must try.  Over the past few meals we have ordered the imported meats and cheeses (Great with wine), crab and lobster \"Louis\" (avocado mousse ties this together perfectly), steamed mussels (light and just enough white wine and garlic) and sausage and peppers (very tasty with al little spice).  Salads were great.  Tried the table side Caesar (very lightly dressed) and Martha's Vineyard salad (bold flavors).  Entrees have been phenomenal.  I have tried several steaks, and all have been cooked to perfection.  I always pair them with the balsamic glaze and chipollini onions.  I have also enjoyed the veal osso bucco, veal all' Aldo and Sea Scallops entree.  Lobster risotto, Fruitti de Mare (So much shellfish) and tortellaci have been my wife's favorites.  Desserts are ridiculously decedent.  From the Andiamo Kit Kat to the must try Italian wedding cake.   Cleanliness: A+  Decor and ambiance was awesome, it's nice to sit in your secluded booth and take it all in while listening to some lounge tunes.  Prices were good, when you take into account what other steakhouses charge in Las Vegas.",

The atmosphere and decor is very classy and the large circular booths are very nice for a group of 4 people. The steak here is amazing, and while it is quite pricey, it is nothing like as expensive as places on the strip of same (or lesser) quality. The only disappointment was our server who can only be described as clueless. He didn't know the answers to fairly basic questions, and annoyingly forgot quite a few requests we made. If it wasn't for that, I'd have given Andiamo's 5 stars.  And for gluten free, as it's a steakhouse this isn't a problem.",

Funny, Hugo somewhat dismissed my question about the Pappardelle with Veal Ragu...\"It's just a pasta dish...\" (I ordered it anyway) but he was much happier with my wife's order - the 8 oz filet rare+  with white truffle whipped potatoes.  Both meals were beautifully plated and smelled incredible.  My pasta was delicious and exactly what I was craving - rich, earthy veal stew over homemade pasta.  I needed it after 3 nights of chichi, foodie dinners.  My wife's filet made clear to me what Hugo meant by \"It's just a pasta dish...\"  It was absolutely the FINEST PIECE OF BEEF either of us have ever eaten (I knew she wouldn't eat it all)!  It was cooked to complete perfection (which is rare when you like rare+) with a perfect char and barely warm, juicy, amazingly tender inside.  The flavor was AMAZING - just yummy, yummy, yummy beef perfectly seasoned with only salt and pepper.  A truly great steak starts with high quality beef, and I've cooked and been served lots of prime, dry-aged, grass fed, etc. beef...and I will say again, the filet from Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse was absolutely the finest beef we have ever eaten.  The fact we thought so delighted Hugo.  He is VERY proud of their beef and he should be!  You can spend more money on a world class steak dinner on the Strip, but you won't get get a better steak.  We will definitely return!",

The food was awesome. There were seven in our party and six of us shared three tomahawk Rib Eye steaks. I do my steaks sous vide at home and these were just as delicious. One of our party does not eat meat and thoroughly enjoyed his shrimp and lobster pasta dish. The side dishes were excellent...the cheesecake devine.    My best friend (whom I shared a Tomahawk with) hates eggplant...and he loved the eggplant, garlic and caper amuse bouche. His Persian wife begged for the recipe to no avail, as eggplant is one of her favorite.  This place is out of the way (downtown) but that makes it that much better during crazy weeks like CES.

I had a fabulous steak that was cooked to absolute perfection. As a person that loves steak I have to say that very few places are capable of making a truly good steak. This is one of those places.     My boyfriend had the swordfish and he said it was very good ( though I don't eat seafood so I.did not taste it). He also got the ceasar salad and we.both enjoyed watching our waiter make it.     Our waiter, whose name was Bart, was very good natured and even okay with us making Simpson's jokes (what can I say, we are fans from the 90's). Anyways it was wonderful food and wonderful service and my boyfriend and I are not wine drinkers but out waiter suggested wines to go with each of our meals and they were amazing. We didn't have dessert but it looked amazing, I plan on coming here again and making room for dessert!!!",

We were pleasantly surprised at how upgraded D Casino is over what it used to be. The atmosphere inside Andiamos was incredible. Very old Vegas feel to it despite only being there for a little over a year. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu items and wine list. His experience working in high end restaurants was apparent. We ordered the \"small\" calamari, Caesars salad, & steaks. The calamari was anything but \"small\"! The portions were large enough for four people to share! The Caesars salad was made table side, with fresh dressing. Absolutely incredible! Since we didn't order pasta, they brought us a small dish of their homemade pasta prior to bringing out our entree' so we could see what we were missing! My mouth is watering thinking about how delicious it was! By the time our steaks arrived, we were both too full to eat them! I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a reasonably priced meal in a great atmosphere!",

The side dishes are definitely big enough for 2 and they're very yummy. Good wine list and a large menu. The waiter was pretty good, but a little smarmy at times. That would be my only complaint though. It is expensive, but certainly no more than the steakhouses on the strip.",

We walked one side of the street and figured we would eat before the light display. As luck would have it we were right outside Andiamo. At that stage we had no idea how lucky we were about to be.  We walked in and were asked if we had a reservation when we said no they said not a problem would we like a table or a booth. This restaurant has the feel of old world Vegas, a real throw back. We opted for a booth. Within seconds John who was our server came and greeted us, he took a drink order and came back with our drink and bread.   Lobster bisque was out of this world good, Steaks were out standing and the desserts were awesome just had troubling picking 1 to try. We will be back here the next time we are in Vegas, its worth the trip just for dinner even if you have no interest in Fremont street itself.",

    "text": "Downtown Las Vegas doesn't have many nice restaurants. This would definitely qualify as that. The food was very good. They make a table side Caesar Salad that was excellent. It's $9 per person!  Three in our party ordered Chilean Sea Bass and thought it was great. Two ordered a pasta dish,Agnolotti. Excellent. We had a bottle of very good Malbac from Mendoza for $44. If you're downtown I highly recommend. My only negative was not with the food or waiter.  It is with the reservation system/hostess.  When I made the reservation I was asked table or booth. I said table since 3 out of he 5 in our party were left handed. The hostess asked the same question when we arrived. It took over 5 minutes to get a table ready. We were there at 5;30. It was not crowded. You have to stand in a tiny vestibule so people are unable to get in or out.  They might want to improve the system.",

Waiter was nice but could of been a better. The food looked great when it was brought out. Big portions. I had ordered some kind of pasta, my friend had stuffed chicken and my other friend ordered thier special steak and pasta $60.  Excited to eat my food i take the first bite and it was good but something was off. I couldn't pin point it until a couple of bites later. My food was extremely salty.  Salty to the point that it makes your face cringe. So i thought it was just me, so i had my friends try it and they said the same thing. Come to find out there food was salty too. Told the waiter that it was salty and his response was\" i never heard of that\" I then proceeded and asked him if he wants to try it and taste all the salt. He said no. But he did not do anything about the fact that our food was salty. His response should of been. Oh would you like us to remake it  or order something different. He did nothing. Our bill for 3 people was $130. For the waiter not doing anything. He did not get no tip. I would never recommend this place. Only go hear if you want to have high blood pressure or have a heart attack from all the salt.",

The great, the good and the bad:  The Great: Calamari appetizer, very tender ($9);  Great filet mignon, done perfectly, ($40) delicious. The Good:  Beet and arugula salad ($8), large portion, enough for two.  The Bad:  Salmon and Peas pasta (highly recommended by the waiter) very salty smoked salmon, in sauce lacking flavor, all in a thick doughy pasta ($28) inedible; Italian wedding cake, excellent the last time was tasteless this time, perhaps old;   the \"service\":  the waiter was attentive at first but then disappeared,  The busboy definitely lacked training.  When clearing the dishes he spilled some of the steak sauce on the table in front of my wife and made no effort to clean it up, leaving a large spot for the remainder of the meal.  He served coffee and never asked if a refill was desired.  He cleared the dishes from our table and an adjacent table on a large tray directly in front of our table.  Definitely not first class!  I would add that this time the manager never stopped by our table to inquire about our meals, which he did on the last occasion.  I was totally disappointed this time in comparison with the previous visit and would have to think twice about going there again.",

Everything was excellent until we paid the bill. We were guest of our friends who had just gotten married. They are from England. They paid the tab. After the bill was collected Carl came to me and asked if there was a problem with the service. I said no everything was fine. He then pointed out (in front of the whole table) the tip that our friends had left, which was just over 10%. He said \"Do you think this is appropriate?\". Tipping in England is very low and over 10% by their standard is generous. I have no problem with Carl bringing this to our attention but it could have been done in a much less confrontational manner. Perhaps he could have asked the person who actually paid the tab to speak in private. Nonetheless the evening was spoiled, our friends were completely embarrassed and I actually wound up over tipping them. Had this been handled more discreetly then the evening would have been a huge success and I would have rated them 5 stars. Thanks for letting me vent.",

Bread was okay, vastly improved by the tapenade they serve with it.  I went with the bone-in ribeye, which was cooked to my medium-rare order, and it looked quite appetizing on the plate.  And...nothing.  I was hoping for the feeling I have gotten at so many other steakhouses where the beef just melts in your mouth, contentment fills your body and a lazy smile spreads across your face.  It just wasn't there.  The pressure shifted to the italian sausage and meatball sides that I had ordered, hoping they put the Italian in Italian Steakhouse.  Mediocrity prevailed there as well.  Same with the \"free\" pasta side.  Overall, it's a nice atmosphere and the service is great, but I just don't think the food had what it takes to compete with other steakhouses in town.",

I had the Frutti di Mar, the seafood was to die for. Super fresh beautiful seafood on top of homemade pasta in a flavorful spicy sauce. My husband opted for the modern day surf and turf - short ribs and scallops accompanied with braised greens and mashed potatoes.We were so full, we couldn't order dessert. This place is above and beyond all of our expectations, we will definitely frequent this place in the future! AMAZING!!!!",

Calamari with marinara for the appetizer.    We shared the 'made at the table caesar salad', and sauteed spinach, and mashed potatoes.   Everything was grand!  They delivered all of our steaks and we were so happy.  Then, I cut into my filet.  I orded it \"black and blue\".  My steak was medium rare.    Sigh.  Suck.  But, I am not the person to send my food back.  I am so afraid they are gong to spit on it, etc.  Our server, Mergim, heard me say that my steak was over done.  He jumped on that immediately.    \"No, No, No.\"  Yes, yes, yes, Mergim said.  Oh Mah Gawd.  They brought out the most beautiful black and blue filet I have had since Mr. TeeJay bbq'd for me in July.    Beautifully seared, and cold in the middle.  Perfect!  Best Steak House in Vegas!",

Having eaten Steak 2 days in row we opted for the Italian side of the menu. Pasta dishes were very good but the Veal Oso Bucco was unbelievable. Deserts were decadent, extensive wine selection.

It was so good and the service so fantastic that I kept going back.  First, this is an amazing restaurant for Las Vegas, Strip or Downtown. I am very glad it is downtown at The D since I usually stay there during March Madness.    Oysters were fantastic.  I did have one that I thought was off (and I eat oysters by the dozen weekly, usually if possible very many dozen) and no questions asked, everything replaced.  Perhaps someone might have caught it, but I don't blame anyone for this.  One great note, I ordered the Lobster Risotto from the bar on a Tuesday.  It arrived and was fabulous...but missing the truffles.  I immediately noticed and let the bartender know.  She went to the kitchen, the chef walked out, looked at the dish, apologized and took it away.  It returned with the perfect amount of truffles and added lobster.  Fantastic.  No discussion, just an apology and the dish made right, probably far better than on the list.  I think this place is amazing.  I was there at the beginning when they'd only been open for I think less than a month. But top to bottom after 4 dinners, this place is five stars with no questions asked.  Sure, I had some hiccups in a couple of items, but there is no way that it detracts from the experience because they did EVERYTHING right.  Bartender was very knowledgable about the wines and I like that.  Great place.  I'm going back as soon as I can.  I would travel across country to eat here.",

I had the Lobster Risotto and it was good but it was also very rich. Too rich for my wife. The wine list was pretty expensive but we were able to find a bottle for around $80 that was very good.  The service was excellent. Our waiter was the best waiter that we had the entire trip and we were staying/eating at the Encore the other three nights.  I would go to Andiamo's again.",

Our waiter was Miguel, he served us with genuine passion, and was very knowledgable about the menu. He came across as the owner, and was extremely kind. The food was outstanding! Everything we ordered, we found ourselves thinking \"this is the best ___ I've ever had\". The Cesar salad was made table side, the steaks are marinated for days before being cooked, and just about everything is prepared from scratch.  I usually only go the the strip in Vegas, but I will definitely make coming to this hidden gem a new tradition. A sincere thank you for everything, from the bottom of my heart.",

She took fantastic care of us the entire time, couldn't be happier with the service. Added on a lobster tail that was also prepared perfectly. Caesar salad prepared table side might be a bit kitchy but it came out great. This is my new favorite steak place downtown.",

(except the butter for the crab legs was cool, not hot) Here is the problem. There is a surf and turf on the menu for $61. I inquired with my waiter if it was possible to get the surf and turf and substitute some crab legs for the lobster. If he had said no that would have been fine but instead he said that it was no problem. So my daughter received a filet with 2 crab legs. When the bill came we were charged for the filet @$43 and 1/2 pound of crab legs at $49. We were also charged $6.50 for a cappuccino that we did not receive. When I brought it to the waiters attention he became frustrated and did not want to fix the bill. Instead he said \"Just knock $20 off the total.\"  It made us uncomfortable because then it appears that it is coming out of the tip and we pride ourselves on being generous. The bill for our meal for 5 people was $400.",

Service could've been a tad bit better and more professional,  but I don't expect the same service for 28 vs. 2 people.   Nonetheless,  my steak was absolutely perfect.  My bone in ribeye was superb. Cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. Not to mention the steak sauce that accompanied it. Absolutely delicious!!!! The Ceasar salad was also phenomenal.

    "text": "Located on the second floor of the D Las Vegas, Andiamos, with other locations in southern Michigan is a terrific addition to the restaurant scene on Fremont Street.  Can't actually say it's THE best as I have only eaten at a few, but if you have a chance to eat here, you won't be disappointed.  I ate here with my partner on a Thursday night (10-29-15) at 9pm and were seated in the back of the restaurant at a table for two.  We were greeted by our server Sandy who we later learned had worked at the property since the early 80s.  Through out our meal, she provided excellent service, was attentive, bubbly, knowledgeable (asked her where beef \"tips\" come from), and added a nice touch to our experience.  Thanks Sandy!  For my meal, I actually ordered a salad and an appetizer as I didn't want a filling meal at 9 in the evening.  Plus, with the nice assorted bread basket and caponata, it can quickly lead to an expanding stomach.  The Kale and Faro salad was a real winner with a white balsamic dressing and shaved Manchego cheese; I could eat this everyday. Yum!  Then for my appetizer, I ordered five jumbo shrimp which were placed atop zippy cocktail sauce with a lemon.  These were really big shrimp...probably 6-8 count.  I would definitely order these again and again.  My partner ordered the beef tips with zip sauce; so amazing and a terrific value option($22) if you want to try their beef without spending $50-60 for a steak. Then decided on the wedge salad which he said was really tasty.  Passed on the dessert cart, but noted they had a really great selection of sweet finishes.  I also appreciate that there is additional seating at their small bar at the front of the restaurant; nice option if you are flying solo. Plus, it's a cozy spot to just sit down and relax with a nice glass of wine. Ahhhh...  I look forward to coming back to Andiamos!",

    "text": "After my meet with friends, I walked a few doors down and went into the D Hotel and Casino to have dinner at the Andiamo Italian Steakhouse.  The room is very nicely done.  I was at one of two tables along a wall that sat two people.  A server came to me and started explaining the specials having told me that my waiter wasn't yet there.  As the first one was explaining the specials, my server appeared.  The first one continued and then they let me study the menu.  In the meantime, a runner brought my iced tea.  I was set to have a steak but when I learned the pasta special for last night was orecchiette, that's what I ordered.  I ordered a small portion of calamari for an appetizer and I got a side of meatballs (2 small) with dinner.  Bread was brought to the table.  It was a nice selection of a cheese brea, salted bread sticks, and some crostini.  Instead of butter, Andiamo serves a very good eggplant caponata with olives for use on the bread bruschetta style.    The calamari came quickly and it was a good sized plate even if it was a small order.  The marinara served with the calamari was quite good.  The orecchiette was fairly good.  It was a bit too al dente.  There were small cubes of meet and some peas in the orecchiette and the sauce was good.  It did need some salt.  The side of meatballs were good.  Again, the sauce was good.  The server pushed the dessert cart to my table and I went with a coconut cake.  There seemed to be a difference of opinion as to what it was.  My server said it was a lime, coconut cake and another server told the woman seated at the next table that it was Key lime pie.  Regardless, the fruit flavor was very light.  The coconut was the star.  Service was very good.  A new glass of iced tea was brought before I was finished with my first.",

From the JUMP your experience awaits you as you transcend through a bricked tunnel threshold that reminds you of your great great grandfather's plantation cellar. So what we told the hostess it was our 3 year wedding anniversary and we aren't even married? Got us an intimate crescent mood lit corner booth and PHENOMENAL creme brulee for dessert with an Italian sweet nothing painted in chocolate that we had no idea what it said but it's the thought that counts. Let me start you off with the table side Caesar salad. Our man Jonny is the mythological god of Caesar salad. Julius Caesar himself licked each romaine heart and the dressing was the blood that Brutus drew. It was that good. And what did we get at an Italian steakhouse? Well we got steak. Not just any steak. This bone in ribeye was the best ribeye I had had in my whole life and I love meat. And the Filet my lovely \"wife\" ordered...cooked to perfection. It was medium and it was rare. It wasn't medium and it wasn't rare. It was medium rare. If you eat medium rare steak you know what a feat that is to achieve. Well chef back there at Andiamo's Italian steakhouse? Compliments to YOU sir. Let me tell you this. You know the review is going to be five stars when you are legitimately UPSET with yourself because you can't finish the truffle lobster baked ziti you got on the side. Oh you want me to say it again? That's right. Truffle lobster baked ziti. It had the lobster, it had the truffle, it had the ziti. There is nothing wrong with this restaurant. 5 stars to everything and everyone. If I could walk in there every day just to shake Jonny's gifted hand and leave. I'd do it. A must visit in Vegas!",

    "text": "Going from best to worst:  5 stars:  The service was excellent.  Our Italian waiter named \"Loan\" was totally on point from start to finish.  The tableside Caesar salad (which originated from Mexico and has nothing to do with Italy) he made was a marvel.  He made the dressing from scratch right in front of us starting with the egg yolk, spices, anchovy and everything else after.  It was so cool to watch.  He certainly wasn't modest about his tableside Caesar skills either saying he \"made it the best\" and it delivered!  This is a must order and for $9 a person is a better deal than the other salads on the menu.    4 stars:  I am a sucker for handmade pasta but we thought ordering a full entree plate of that would be insanely too much food so we begrudgingly went with the lobster black truffle baked ziti.  This was supposed to be a side dish but it was a huge portion easily for 4 people and it was so good!  They definitely didn't skimp on the lobster meat and it made for great leftovers the next day.    Nutfish Z's great review twisted my arm into ordering the \"Andiamo Grande Meatball\".  Just what I need right?  A meat appetizer followed by an entree of more meat!  The meatball was a little smaller than the size of a softball and was a handmade blend of veal, pork and beef.   It was a little more on the solid side and the sauce with the ricotta cheese topping really was a great blend of flavor.  Nice meatball!  This is not to be mistaken for their side dish of meatballs which is only beef and pork.     3 stars:  We got a side order of the \"olive oil grilled asparagus with cipollini onions\" which was a nice sized portion compared to most other steakhouses.  The sauce on top was good and I like cipollini onions on pretty much anything including Fruity Pebbles.    2 stars:  Our waiter gave us 2 surprise plates of spaghetti topped with a kind of tomato cream sauce courtesy of the chef right before our entrees came out.  It was totally unnecessary filler considering we already ordered a pasta dish and I didn't think it was very good.  I saw Ron S's photo afterward with his caption asking if the sauce came from a can.  I thought the same thing!  My wife liked it better than I did.  I know I sound like a putz complaining about free food but this wasn't needed at all and I would just set this aside if/when they give it to you before the entrees come out.    1 star:  It pains me to even write this but it was the goddamn steak itself!!  I got the bone in ribeye (had plans to go for the Tomahawk after Teri W's great review but they have since upped the price from $65 to $79) and my wife got the filet mignon.    I take my first bite and shake my head kinda like \"huh\"?  I take another bite, get more perplexed and then I take a final bite from a different section, turn to my wife and say \"this is not good at all\".  The ribeye was lukewarm at best, dry and wasn't even up to par with the $13 flat iron steak I had at Herbs and Rye a few days before that.    My wife's filet mignon was good....if you want it to taste like AHI TUNA!!!  She was surprisingly OK with it though so who was I to argue?  Loan comes back, asks how things are and I tell him my problems with the ribeye.  It was as if this quality of steak should have been saved for fools that ordered well done.  It also seemed like the steak had been sitting in the kitchen for a while based on the temperature.  Loan seemed stunned by this as was I.  I've had plenty of ribeyes and this was the first time I've ever sent one back.  I've only thought about doing it one other time (N9NE) but didn't pull the trigger.  I would've sent back my wife's filet had I ordered that as well.    I got the porterhouse instead which was MILES AND MILES better.  It was juicy and beefy where it was supposed to be and the temperature was to my satisfaction.  That was 3.5 stars.    So in the end, I would still come back here for the Italian fare, Caesar salad, ambiance and service but you might want to stick with Vic and Anthony's a couple of casinos over if you're looking for great steak.",

My wife and I when we vacation in Vegas always stay at The D casino, so on one occasion we were looking for places to eat we decided upon Andiamo's to try. The food was perfect, great flavor and perfectly cooked. The service second was to none, the server explained and made a great recommendation with a wine paired perfectly for our meal. Our go to restaurant used to be Emeril's Fish house at the MGM, but now with having to pay for parking at the MGM and Andiamo's being in the hotel we stay at along with the food and service being phenomenal well Andiamo's won out as our new go to restaurant. We have been here several times now to eat, service and food has not changed still top notch.   Book in advance with Open Table up to 90 days ahead as the tables fill up early and a last minute reservation time won't be available.  Thank you Andiomo's you have a new lifetime customer. I have a vacation planned in May and have 2 reservations planned!",

    "text": "I had a lovely time celebrating my 30th birthday here with my boyfriend. The booths are private, dark romantic atmosphere that screams old Vegas in a classy way with a great menu. Located at the D hotel in Fremont Street, this was an almost perfect last meal in Vegas. We were expecting to splurge on a fantastic meal that would be unforgettable, as a foodie should do while in Vegas, but ended up splurging on just a very good meal instead. I'd say the atmosphere makes up for anything lost in the food. Don't get me wrong the food was great but some things better than others. I researched steakhouses in Vegas for quite a while before choosing Andiamo. It does seem to be a bit overrated based on the food alone. Our server was friendly and attentive but gave us time and space to enjoy our meal. The hostesses upon entering were two older ladies but not very friendly. They kind of seemed judgmental of us or cold, couldn't tell what it was, but just not very welcoming. We are used to this as an interracial couple, not sure if that had anything to do with it, but I find it rude at an establishment where we are spending over $200 on dinner. We quickly forgot about them of course and our server made up for it.   While I would go there again to try their seafood or other pastas, my boyfriend said he wouldn't splurge on their steaks again. His long bone ribeye came out the perfect medium rare, cooked perfectly but was missing a little flavor. It was thick and juicy which is what he care about most. Again good but not blow your mind as you expect for that price. The gnocchi on the side was a nice touch, flavorful but lacking salt maybe? Same with the side of lobster truffle ziti (their Mac and cheese), a little more salt, garlic and truffle flavor would be nice, this side seemed lackluster in flavor and lobster too. I loved the side of sauted mushrooms and onions, very flavorful. I ordered the Tortillaci pasta without the sausage since I'm vegetarian and there wasn't many options for me. The entire dish was good and made with a comforting creamy tomato based sauce with ricotta stuffed large tortellini type pasta. The veggies in it tasted fresh and while I liked the dish, the pasta itself was a little over cooked and lacked ricotta, it was hard to even notice ricotta in there. The sauce was good with fresh slices of garlic. In the end, I was wished I had tried one of the seafood dishes instead. The real standout was the calamari which was large slices and fresh tasting, with a light flavorful marinara sauce on the side. It included fried banana peppers and lemon, very good! I also loved their lobster bisque, the presentation at the table and the truffle cream flavor was delicious. The olive and eggplant tapenade and bread complimentary for the table was an excellent addition to the meal. I liked the tapenade but wasn't blown away either. As was the theme for the night.    Andiamo is a great spot to go off the strip for romance and old Vegas charm with decent food and great service. Their menu is extensive and I'm sure I'd find something I liked more but overall everything lacked a little flavor expected from good Italian. Nice spot for date night and to share a bottle of wine, great calamari and bisque. Decent pasta and steak but not certainly the best. The experience and service were excellent and made us leave happy.",

Ambiance is classy but because there doesn't seem to be much of an enforced dress code the scene can be anywhere from ragged t-shirts and up.  Service was friendly. Food came out quickly.  Nice wine list. Almost too many things going on in the food menu itself.  Calamari fritti - a house speciality - was quite good. Tender, well seasoned, big portion.  24oz bone in ribeye, ordered medium rare. Cooked as requested for the inside but I had a hard time getting over the charred flavor on the outside. Not the good kind of steak char; like the bitter char you taste when you burn bread in the toaster. The meat also did not have any of the signature complexity I've come to expect from 30 days of dry aging. Pretty blah, and occasionally unpleasant due to the char.  The gnocchi served with the steak were tender and flavorful. Brussels sprouts ordered for the side were OK but not anything to write home about.  I hear this is one of the best steakhouses in Vegas but I was pretty disappointed. I'd definitely try other places. If you're expecting Luger's this is unfortunately not it.",

Hubby loves staying at The D so since we were already there,  we decided on Andiamo's for dinner.   It was a Monday night and we didn't have reservations but were able to be seated immediately. Our server Marco was great, very friendly, informative and made great recommendations for our meal.   We had the Cesar salad for two. It's made table side and a very large portion. Fresh, well seasoned, fresher shaved parm and croutons made for a very tasty salad.   Hubby had the bone in rib eye with zip sauce, shaved Brussel sprouts with bacon, and I had the frutti de mare. We definitely over ordered because we were barely able to eat half our entree. Hubby didn't even touch the sprouts he was so stuffed. I just ate all the seafood and a bit of the noodles.   We also wanted to save room for dessert. Hubby opted for the Chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and I had a cappuccino. Lava cake was warm and gooey, not overly sweet and of shareable size. My cappuccino had the perfect amount of foam and I liked the Little Rock candy sugar stick on the side. I thought that was a nice touch.    Overall, great experience, service and food. I can see why hubby likes this place! Would definitely fine here again the next time we're in Vegas.",

All the waiters are cultured and know the menu front-to-back.  Our waiter gave us some excellent suggestions, particularly in the wine.   We started with a bottle of Chianti Classico, Querciabella, 2013.  Smooth and delicious.    They bring out a sauce made from Eggplant, tomatoes and olive oil which was quite good    For dinner, we shared the bone-in 20 oz Ribeye with Lobster mashed potatoes.   Dessert was Creme Brulee'.  Although the food was very rich, it was delicious.   Service was impeccable.  Wine was perfect for the meal.",

We get in and get seated at the worst table ever so I asked for a new one only to be told no luck and u have to wait. I really didn't mind until the part where we couldn't even sit at the restaurants bar but escorted to a casino bar ( cost me another $50 waiting / gambling) anyway we waited and finally gave up.  I will NEVER come here again or recommend this place.",

    "text": "It's a very good restaurant but if I'm comparing it to other fine steakhouses I've been to, it's just not quite as impressive and I need to be impressed when I go to a steakhouse in Las Vegas. Most of the fellas I was with really enjoyed their meals, this review is just about my experience so you may really enjoy yourself. Our waiter was the shining star of the evening, an older gentleman originally from New York. You could tell he really enjoyed his job & put a smile on everyone's face. OK like I said previously I only ranked it lower based on other steaks I've had really I would say it's 3.5 stars compared to the best of the best. The colossal shrimp were just that, the only problem is shrimp that large tended to be a little tough which it was. The steak was good & I ordered it with the house \" zip sauce\" , mostly butter with maybe a couple other ingredients sprinkled in. Lastly we had to wait about 20 minutes after our scheduled reservation in the D casio. Kind of reminded me of something out of Vegas Vacation movie. The price was reasonable for a steak house if I factor that in bump it up to 4 stars but I wasn't trying to save money as much as going for the best meal possible. All in all if you're in old Vegas not a bad place stop just don't go in with Peter Luger size expectations.",

I ordered the tomahawk ribeye and a friend ordered the halibut.  The halibut came out perfectly cooked.    The tomahawk came out and I know for a large 24oz steak it can be tough to get it to be a perfect medium.  The seasoning was tasty and the gnocchi was good.   Next time I'll order it rare but overall it was a good experience and glad we ate there.",

This time we didn't have steak but some members of our party did and said it was excellent. I totally believe them because I seen their plates when they were done haha.  The Chilean Sea Bass is to die for! Although I did like the sauce they used to use better over the rice cake. This time they had some pumpkin thing going on which was still good but just not the same as the zip sauce... Then there was the pasta, which was cooked just right and the sauce was spot on. Definitely a great upscale steak place to try.",

I needed a steak place on short notice and the strip was booked.  A friend recommended this place.  THANK YOU!!  I couldn't have had a better evening.  Food, wine, staff and the company were unforgettable.  Let's start with the ambiance.  We were seated in a round booth with a very high back, away from the main area of the restaurant, and it was perfect.  I am now judging all other great steak places by this.  Literally,  I am looking and looking....if you have suggestions-please let me know!  Our server was Miguel.  What a fun and entertaining delight he is!  We will return and will request time and time again.  He made great suggestions and his banter was sharp and witty.    The food!  To start we had shrimp cocktail.  This is Vegas.  I'm pretty sure you can get shrimp cocktail at the gas station with your can of beer and walk around with it.  But this version is on point. Shrimp perfectly cooked and chilled.  I love horseradish...you could taste the freshness of it in the cocktail sauce.  More please.  For our main course it was the Osso Bucco; Served over homemade fettuccine with a lovely rich ragu.  I will tell you that I have never had osso bucco before and now my standards will be really high.  It was so tender, and the sauce so perfect and the pasta...damn.  We finished with the Kale Rustico salad that rounded the meal off so perfectly that dessert wasn't even needed.    My only regret for you all that will read this review is:  the wines selected for each course were made by my amazing dinner companion and were just perfection.    Now go!  Have an amazing dinner!  Ask for Miguel.  I heard Hugo is great too :)",

This is a great find and does not focus in flipping tables and getting guests in and out.  The only miss was lack if nice champagne or sparkling by the glass.  We like to start out meal with a nice glass of bubbles before moving into our red wine for the main part of the dinner.",

We had a party of 6 and it cost half of what the higher end Strip meals cost without giving up anything in flavor - and frankly, better than some of the high end places on the strip. I can't go into each meal we ordered, but I can tell you we ordered 6 different things, we had 5 different apps and we had a Cesar salad made fresh table side and there was not one thing that wasn't excellent. There was a mozzy app that I still dream about a month later. When I come back to Vegas this will always be on my must hit list from now on.",

We also ordered a side of mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The dessert looked delicious, but we were too full after our entree. The portions are a good size. Overall, I would recommend this place for a good date night, and you can't go wrong ordering any steak on the menu.",

I reluctantly agreed to eat here, even though I was hoping to eat at one of the Italian restaurants located in a swanky hotel on the Strip. I am soooooo glad that I listened to my dear friend and dined at Andiamo. The food? Fabulous! We are both Italian and very picky about the Italian food we eat. The service? Perfection! John waited on us and treated us like longtime friends of the family. Since our return to the LA area, we have recommended this restaurant to many friends and family. We will definitely be back next trip! We miss you John!!!!",

I had the caprese salad and it was perfect. Good potions too as I ate the entire dish. My main course was the cold water Scottish salmon with Carmelites fennel omg OMG the fennel really put the icing on the dish it was sooo good. I had wine which was good and dined alone in my own booth with a very intimate setting. Perfect service perfect ambiance amazing food very rare that you get all three I will definitely be back!",

The signature Tomahawk Ribeye will melt in your mouth. Be sure and ask for the homemade steak sauce \"zip sauce\" with it. Delish!!! I could bath in it! The shrimp cocktail is so fresh and the cocktail sauce is spiced with the right amount of horseradish. The chopped salad has a Parmesan dressing that is unbelievable. Don't forget to get it. All of the pasta dishes are perfectly cooked. The Veal Aldo will simply melt in your mouth. The side order of grilled asparagus and cipollini onions is huge and so tasty. The complimentary \"relish\" they serve is very different and addicting. It includes eggplant, olives, capers and much more. The dessert cart is ever changing and scrumptious! Go there if you can. Ask for Miguel. He is awesome.",

You will not be hungry when you leave, still have money in your pocket, and have some great service (thanks Miguel).  It has been a week and I am still thinking of the meal I had.  It was the best meal of the week and I am looking forward to my next trip to stop in again.  There were three of us and we had the caesar salad, steaks, mashed potatoes, mushroom and onions, the three steak sauces, and several drinks for the price of $200.  I was too full to eat any of the deserts (kit kat or chocolate cake).  I can not say enough good things about this place.    On a side note the side of angel hair pasta they bring with your steak is heaven.  I stayed at the Wynn and ate at Allegro (Italian) the next night getting their angel hair entree.  The pasta here was by far superior.",

The clientele are \"ruff\" and the half naked blackjack/\"Pole Dancers\" add to the distasteful walk though this dive. Once we arrive at the restaurant we were greeted by several host, that almost have their act together.   We were seated at a booth (we requested a booth on Open Table).  A server approached our table immediately.  We requested Still Bottled Water.  This server didn't have a clue what we were talking about.  However, he did get another server that understood.   Our server, Miguel, was excellent.  He decanted our wine and poured it perfectly.  He described the food and explained how the chef suggested it be served.  He was attentive, but not hovering, The Cesar Salad, prepared table side was excellent.  The presentation of the Lobster Bisque was exquisite.  We were served a complimentary tasting of home made Angel Hair Pasta with a light tomato cream sauce.  OUTSTANDING!  We had Oso Boco, Rack of lamb and Swordfish.  The Oso Boco was outstanding.  Served hot and flavorful.  I did not taste the Swordfish.  The Lamb was very flavorful, prepared medium.  However, the Lamb was \"warm\" as was the bed of VERY SALTY INEDIBLE tomato something.    The deserts are OUTSTANDING!  The Terramisu  was one of the best.  We also tried the Italian Wedding Cake....THIS IS A MUST TRY!   The bottom line is, there is no doubt this restaurant is one of the finest in Las Vegas.  If you can look past the walk though this dreadful place, you won't be disappointed by the food or atmosphere.",

The hostess said she wasn't sure if they could take them, even though they had been purchased at Andiamo in Detroit and didn't have any restrictions listed.

    "text": "A special place at an unusual spot.  Located at the wanna-be cool D Hotel, it's at the top of an escalator, where the entrance to the bathroom next to it is wider than the restaurant.  But enter thru the brick rounded hallway, and amazing you will find.  I made a reservation for 630pm, but I didn't really need to.  It was near empty at that time.  Later, it filled up and was bustling.  What it did assure me is seating at a booth, instead of table.  And the booth, ohhhh, had very soft leather to sit on and to feel.  The menu is large format, and 2 pages.  What I noticed is that the prices, particularly of the appetizers and wine, is very reasonable if not cheap.  I got 2 glasses of Malbec for $11 each, and they were like butter, very good.  I couldn't help myself.  Dining with a good local friend, the sky was the limit.  We ordered:  1.  The Gigantic Meatball ($9) - Perfectly cooked and in an amazing marinara, it was the equivalent to 6 or so meatballs.  Paired with the fresh, warm bread, this was an absolute winner all-the-while topped with ricotta cheese.  (4.5 stars)  2.  Asparagus ($9) - Seasoned and in Olive Oil, it was an extremely large portion -- a full stock of thin spears.  (5.0 stars)  3.  Truffle Mashed Potatoes ($8) - Wonderful, with the flavor of truffle.   How can it be bad?  (4.0 stars)  4.  Filet Mignon ($38) - Cooked medium, it was the real deal.  Served with an amazing side of pasta with vodka sauce.  (4.5 stars)  5.  Agnolotti ($22) - Handmade pasta filled with ground veal, beef and pork in wild mushroom-basil creme sauce.  It was like pierogi in a cream sauce.  Excellent.  (4.25 stars)  The service was the kind expected at a white tablecloth type of place, but Raul was a very nice and personable man who could take a joke or two, not stuffy.  While he could do a better job at memorizing the menu, he was first class all the way.  Wonderful experience.",

If your looking for a good steak go here,  if you don't mind the price. We got Calamari as an appetizer and it was very good with 3 different dipping sauces (all good). We also received sides of pasta on the house. Atmosphere was good not noisy and service was good (Paul was great!)",

The calamari appetizer was excellent but when it was time for the main course the server (or chef) forgot one of our 7 entrees. No big deal because about 5 minutes later it arrived. However during this time we noticed that one of the other steaks was way over cooked. The server took it back and we waited ... and waited. The rest of us had finished our meal and the steak still hadn't arrived. What's worse is that when it did arrive the side dishes had all gone cold which was even more disappointing because all the sides we ordered were really good (especially the asparagus).   There was no real apology offered for the extra long delay nor an offer to warm up any of the sides. If this were to happen at a low-end restaurant I'd be okay with it, but not when you're paying approximately $100 per person.",

We had a porterhouse, split a cesar and a baked potato.  The steak was really, really tasty and perfectly done.  no complaints on the baked potato or cesar, either.  For someone who wants to escape the craziness of the Strip (or the crazy Strip prices), this is a great option.  The D hotel is also a cool space to gamble and enjoy some Downtown Vegas life, but it isn't on Freemont so you can avoid the craziness.  I highly recommend Joe Vicari's.

Both were good, but I enjoyed the salad more than the soup which was barely warm.  We ordered the small tomahawk steak, a filet, scallops, and lobster risotto.  Steaks were good...made better with the zip sauce.  Scallops were good but there were only 4 on the plate...not particularly big more medium size.  The lobster risotto was the disappointment.  It was only warm and the lobster claw meat on the top was cold.  Flavor was good but the truffles it was topped with had no aroma or flavor.  They were the right texture but absolutely no flavor or smell....how does that happen?  The waiter heard me say something about them and told the chef.  They brought out a small dish of shaved truffles which still had no aroma or flavor.  I think the restaurant needs to have a convo with their supplier.   We valeted the car at the D....when it was returned to us, the valet had smoked pot in the car.  Didn't have a chance to say anything as there were people waiting to get out.   Soooo...self park and stick with the steaks and the zip sauce!",

    "text": "I was in Fremont Street (haven't been in a while) and wanted to have a good steak meal.  I looked on Yelp and saw this steakhouse had good reviews.  They had plenty of reservation for Friday night, so I made one and wandered over to Fremont Street.  Fremont street has definitely changed a lot from back when I was a kid and it was cool to see how they made all the changes.  I arrived just in time to see the light show.    The steakhouse is located at D Casino on the second level.  For a Friday night, it was medium busy.  I got seated right away and the server took the drink order.  I was very hungry so I also ordered right away.  I decided on a charcuterie board and tomahawk steak to share.  The first thing that came out was a taster pasta on the house.  The pasta was surprisingly very delicious.  The sauce was light and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  The charcuterie came next.  I was quite disappointed.  The meats were were just not that good and the cheeses were just average.  I would skip that if I come back.  The steak came out pretty quickly after.  The server will come out and cut the steak in front of you, which was good.  (Although, I don't think that the server cut our steak very well.  LOL).  The steak itself was very good.  The meat was perfectly cooked and was so tender.  I also got a trio of sauce which I did not really enjoy.  I thought none of the sauces went well together.  But, sides were amazing! I got mushrooms, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.  All sooo good.  If you are looking for a good steakhouse off strip, I would definitely recommend coming here.  I think that the prices were also way cheaper than going to a steakhouse on the strip.  I would definitely come back here if I am back here again.",

I had the surf and turf, filet mignon and lobster tail!!' My partner chose the ribeye with lobster tail and shrimp cocktail and oysters for appetizers. The zinger sauce tastes amazing, so yum points all around. Our server (hugo I think his name was) made us feel really welcomed. He even came over and took a really great photo of my romantic date night. Truly top notch!! If you're reserving for 4 or less ppl take the booth, it's a visual masterpiece and way better than the circle tables. It's a really swank place for a birthday party. Will be here again for some quality grub, or a big group of girls on a night out.",

My sons 21st birthday - 4 of us - ordered the Andiamo Grande Meatball & the Portabella Tenderloin Tips in Zip sauce for our appetizer.  Then 2 of us ordered the Long Bone Ribeye (24 oz) & the other 2 of us ordered the Porterhouse (24 oz).   [The Zip Sauce on appetizer was AMAZING] --So I asked for it on my Porterhouse.   Every bite felt like comfort & relaxing. (I know--doesn't make sense, but it's the only way I can describe it)  I have NEVER had a steak that made me FEEL something--besides a yummy feeling--so it was an odd thing to feel something about what I was eating. But, I truly felt comfortable & relaxed with each bite. I closed my eyes after each bite and felt so good - it was a sensory experience- don't know why--EXCEPT that it tasted fantastic.   Paul was our server & he made us feel like we were old friends!   Whatever you decide on eating - if it's steak-- ASK FOR THE ZIP SAUCE!   Thank you, Paul & Andiamo Italian Steak House!",

The seafood is just my favorite part of the steakhouse experience, i'm not sure what kind of lobster tails they serve here but they are absolutely delicious, they compare to lobster i've had while up in the east coast!  This is definitely the best restaurant downtown!",

Really cool old style steak house located in the \"D\" hotel in the Fremont district that looks that it walked right out of the 1950's old school Vegas.  Forewarn I would highly suggest you make a reservation because this place gets busy.   What made this place extra special outside the food was our server Miguel. Probably one of the best waitress I have had in years. He took his time walking us through the menu and made some great recommendations. Here's the deal go with the waiters suggestions because everything we ate was amazing. We started off with their giant meatball...Delicious! Also had some calamari also...Delicious! Plus made a great wine suggestion with some Caymus which also paired well with dinner. Be also warned stay away from their assortment of freshly baked break it's dangerous...for dinner everyone had a little something different from lobster ravioli, rib-eye steak, Porter house, filet, scallops and me and a co worker got the veal osso bucco. Can't speak for their food but everyone raves about how delicious it was. Now for the osso bucco this was outstanding. The meat was so tender you did not need a knife at all you could've used a spoon. Plus the extra bonus was they give you a special utensil to scoop out the bone marrow. Don't frown until you try it because it's amazing.   Overall outstanding experience here...wish there was room for desert but after that meal it wouldn't be humanly possible. Thank you Miguel and all the staff for making this such a great time.",

Once our party arrived, we sat at our table and our waiter came over to ask if we'd like more drinks, and as one table goer asked about appetizers, our genial waiter with the Greek accent, was wonderful at explaining each dish.  An assortment of appetizers plus a seafood tower was ordered, everything was fantastic. Meals also were very good, as were desserts.",

Our server was very friendly and provided good recommendations.  There was a broad selection of wines at various price points.    We ordered the calamari as an appetizer based on the recommendation from our waiter.  It was delicious and the portion was huge!  We ate less than half to save our appetite for the rest of the food.  We split the chopped salad--great and perfect to share!  I had the Filet Mignon (there were 3 sizes, I ordered the smallest portion).  My husband got the Bone-In N.Y. Strip.  Both were ordered medium rare, and both were delivered medium.  That was a disappointment for us.  The sides were good though, we ordered the Brussels Sprouts and White Truffle Whipped Potatoes.    They gave us a complimentary dessert since our steaks were over cooked.  I ordered the Creme Brulee.  It was a little too rich for me, but still good.",

    "text": "Fortunately my friends and I had comps to eat here because it is a little pricey but definitely worth it.  There are two things you MUST have here:  the zip sauce and the Caesar salad.    The zip sauce could be affectionately eaten with shoe leather and it would taste good.  It is their signature sauce and will pair amazing with beef or lamb.  We giggled when our waitress said it was simply veggie consomme with butter and HWC.  I later looked up the recipe and made it myself - much more complicated and delicious.  I opted for the lobster bisque which was good but I had salad envy because my hubby got the Caesar which was amazing.  Probably one of the best Caesar salads I have ever eaten.   Go for the Caesar but note it must be with two people eating it because it is served table side.  Everyone got steaks but me - I opted to carb out for the pasta carbonara and wasn't disappointed.  I can always snag a bite of the beef which of course I did multiple times with that amazing zip sauce.  All of the pasta is homemade so you can't go wrong.   It was a tough choice between rare cow or amazing pasta.  Service was a little on the slow side but not too bad.  The waitress was an older lady who cracked me up with that zip sauce recipe comment on how she is the hit of all the parties when she brings it.    You must make reservations to eat here.  We ended up eating at 8:45pm which isn't bad in Vegas time.  Did I mention this is a small Detroit chain that landed at a Detroit themed hotel (The D)?  Coney dogs downstairs and zip sauce upstairs.....what could be better?",

When we walked into the restaurant, we were immediately impressed.  It's beautiful.  We were seated in a booth, which I usually don't like, but these booths are great.  They're circular with high backs, providing a lot of privacy and making conversation easy. We were greated very quickly after being seated, and the delicious cocktails we ordered were served within minutes of our arrival.  This is a pet peeve of mine, so that got things off to a good start. One of my guests ordered a steak, and the other ordered a bowl of lobster bisque and ceasar salad, and they were both very pleased.  I ordered the fish, which was fileted table side.  I was pleased, too, but I think it would be better if they moved on from butter and used olive oil.  It was a wonderful piece of fish, but butter sauce is too old school, even for a steakhouse.  Perhaps I should have requested the olive oil, but I didn't. Tony served us, and did a great job.  He was attentive without being a pest.  He brought out a couple of small \"compliments of the chef\" dishes that were great, too. We throughly enjoyed our evening at Andiamo's, and we will go back.  I hope you'll go, too, and support what's going on downtown!  It is on par with fine dining on the Strip.",

Living in NJ on the east coast  we would eat lobster in Maine, crabs in Maryland, fresh dug clams right on the bay where we lived, it was amazing. Also trying food all over the country from fresh steak in Texas, to pizza in NY Etc. Then we moved next to Las Vegas in Arizona and there were thousands of restaurants in Vegas with amazing food to explore. About a year ago we found ANDIAMO STEAKHOUSE in the D Casino on Fremont Street. From the moment you walk you know it's going to be to special. We just didn't realize how special it would become to us. We love clams and fresh linguini in white sauce and have had a hard time finding it on the west coast. Well I mentioned this to our waitress Sandy (I'll tell you about her later ;) ). It's wasn't on the menu so she had the chef come out introduce himself and made it special for us. The sauce was the most delicious EVER! While dinner was being prepared Sandy made our fresh Caesar salads right at the table and the dressing was fresh, and absolutely PERFECT. Now as I stated we have been many great restaurants and I'm not a person who writes review or even go on social media but in this case I felt I really had to and tell you about Sandy now \"our \" waitress forever. She changed how I view a night out with my husband. She has made our special night once a month or so incredible special and happy. Just to walk in and see her smile and happiness makes my entire night and we talk about our weekend the entire month anticipating the next time we get to go again. She is one of the if not the reason we keep going back again and again bringing all our family and friend when they come to visit also. we used to always go from restaurant to restaurant trying new things. Who would have ever thought we would find the perfect to spot. THIS IS IT. The incredible food. entire wait staff and of course Sandy. When you make your reservation you have to request her. She has been there forever and is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. Enjoy, I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.",

We got all dressed up, and the waitress we got was super nice. The food was really good. We got the Caesar Salad, where the dressing is made fresh table-side, and it was delicious. We both got steaks, medium-well. They were a little over-cooked, but most expensive steakhouses can't cook anything above medium without messing it up, so I'm not docking points for that. They were kind enough to bring us out a small bowl of pasta as we awaited our steaks, and the waitress checked on us regularly. My only complaint was about the mashed potatoes. They're an expensive side, they're dry, and taste pretty horrible, all of which can be attributed to the inclusion of truffle oil.  Be prepared to spend some money while you're there, my bill for my gf and I (including about 22% tip) was about $140.",

Unfortunately, my husband is ill after his meal consisting of a creamy salad, and our hostess was incredibly rude, her manager stepping in to save our night and seat us at the bar. Bar staff was wonderful, and human, but could not make up for our initial unwelcome. Make a reservation by phone, not in person, or you might be made to feel unwelcome and overlooked.",

The fresh berries just took it over the top. My friends had to hold me back from ordering another slice. This is a great place. Amazing staff top notch. Your looking at about $50-$85 per person without alcohol but it's worth it if you can afford it. I may go back again before I leave! Also although it's a nice place they did not complain at us for wearing jeans, although I would love to have dressed up to go there.",

I read reviews for the best steakhouse in Vegas, and I thought that I had been to the best steakhouses on the strip, and it wouldn't be worth a trip downtown to go to this steakhouse I never heard of, Andiamos. I'm telling you that I was wrong. This was one of the most incredible meals I had, I would absolutely say it was MEMORABLE. The steak melted in my mouth- it was one of the best filets I ever had. And I am EXTREMELY critical. So I will say the service was mediocre. The ambiance was great, but not the best Ive ever been to. But the meal... from the soup which was outstanding, to the eggplant appetizer, the best my wife said she had, to the steak which was incredible, to the dessert which was excellent- it rates as one of the best meals I ever had. Im looking forward to coming back... hopefully having the service experience that matches the food.",

It is tucked away in The D Hotel and Casino, but once you find your way into the steakhouse, it has a beautiful decor with a midwestern chophouse feel.    We ordered the carpaccio and it was a delicious start to the meal.  We ordered a NY Strip, Gnocci, and their signature Tomahawk 32 ounce steak.  Everything was cooked to perfection and was packed with delicious flavors and sauces for dipping the steaks.  I am a grappa connoisseur and the bar did not stock the traditional italian after dinner drink, but after speaking with the manager he informed me that there would be at least one bottle in stock next week.  They have a top notch staff and I will be returning with any friends or family that visits Las Vegas.    This is an absolute must try if you are in Vegas and want an unforgettable experience.",

Our mouths were burning and we love spicy food. It was covered in some kind of sauce and that wasn't what was spicy it was the long soft cooked peppers. It was worth the heat! Ok so I'm a seafood fan and I went for the Fruitti de Mare (I think I said it right). Thin pasta covered with shrimp, calamari, oyster, clams. The boyfriend got a steak I'm not sure exactly what kind but it was cooked just right and even had crispy tips topped with friend onions. He also got a side of the potatoes covered with cooked onions, the potatoes were not as soft as we usual like them but were pretty good. Oh and they have him this sauce for his steak. Our waiter John was always checking up on using sure we had what we wanted and was very polite, assertive and hands down awesome!

    "text": "Holy cow, our dinner was incredible to say the least. I can't say enough about the service and our selected meal. The reason for not getting the five stars is that our waiter simply forgot to place the appetizer order. At 150.00 for two people, that shouldn't occur. I'm one for giving someone a little grace as the place was packed. To make up for his mistake, our server went overboard from their on out. We had the tossed Caesar salad, made at our table which was a killer. I could have made that my meal, perhaps I should have as I'm on a diet.....nah it's Vegas. I had the special Bone in Rib-eye for 68.00, with home made Gnocchi (spelling) on the side. The steak was so rich and tender and cooked to perfection. I literally could cut it with a fork, but opted for the steak knife. I could hear my mom in the back of my head, \"use your knife, I taught you better dining manners\". My girlfriend had the had the Potato Gnocchi. It was also so rich and flavorful and melted in our mouths. Our waiter was fabulous and just because he forgot the appetizer, didn't take away from how he made our evening. Mistakes occur and our evening was fabulous, all because of the food and the professional, outgoing, knowledgeable staff, to include the man filling out water, at least my water. I think he and I were having a competition. I'd drink some water, he'd fill it right back up, then I'd take a few more drinks and he was on top of his game.  I left well hydrated and ready to hit the bars for more drinks......Thank and we will be back again",

    "text": "First off, I love the zip sauce, and it's nice to have around since a lot of places just have the usual like bernaise or hollandaise.  The bread and tapenade was delicious, a good start.  We went with the portabello mushroom appetizer which came with the zip sauce.  Pretty solid, I'd order it again.  I went with the bone-in-ribeye for my entree.  I will say I was disappointed in the steak by itself.  The meat stand alone felt under seasoned if it was even seasoned at all.  The side of zip sauce saved it, but sometimes it's nice to taste a ribeye by itself and get a sense of all the flavor from the marbling.  The side of cream spinach was average, I'd probably try a different side next time.  We were in a hurry so didn't order dessert but I hear the carrot cake is phenomenal so I'll put that on the list for next time.   I did like the atmosphere and decor inside and the service was solid.",

The steaks are fabulous my favorite is the filet however my hubby just raves over the tomahawk rib steak. We eat here at least 3 times a year and never have been dissatisfied. Oh and if you are a ceasar salad fan Vicaris. prepared and tossed at the table ceasar is not to be missed. I cannot attest to thier other Italian dishes but I could live on their spaghetti.",

My parents both just recently returned from Italy and found the food to be just as good if not better than the food they had on their trip.   Ate pasta instead of the steaks. While the pasta was good, left feeling we really should of gone for the meat. Pasta was more on the creamy side personally, but I am sure that is just more so the way the pasta is.  Definitely recommend this place. Great dining in Downtown Vegas.",

The cheese plate was not the same that my friends remembered (smaller), the Bronzino was a bit dry and overly lemon-y, and my husband ordered the steak special - which was really just strange. It was described as a steak with a side of pasta.. but it was really more like \"steak Parmesan\" on top of pasta, served in a heated dish. My husband probably would not have ordered it if he had known it would come covered in cheese, and the hot plate actually cooked his steak beyond his requested medium rare. The wine was great, and I'm sure we'll be back - hopefully for a better experience.",

    "text": "This place was absolutely fantastic! After reading both good & bad reviews about this place on yelp me & my husband decided to take a chance with this steakhouse. I was a little worried me being a african American girl I read a review that said this place was racist against black ppl. Absolutely Not! I got a different vibe from them. My husband is italian & although I did feel like the host at the front door who greeted us upon arrival & sat us down @ our seats was a little weird.  When she told us to enjoy our dinner she only told it to him not me, I mean literally looking him in his face, I almost felt imaginary lol. Idk maybe I was being too sensitive. Then when she sat us down she asked us if we wanted the small table sat for 2 or a bigger table set for 4. We choose the bigger table because the table for two was more for a table of 1 once you have food on it. We had to wait for the table to be cleaned off and set. We saw napkins forks & knives set on the table so my husband asked the lady if we could have a seat now, she then sarcastically said \"glasses\" as if he was dumb for not knowing that. After the table was set we had a seat & the lady apologized for the table not being ready upon our arrival. Our server was very nice & polite always checking up on us. I can't stand when your @ a resturant  & you have to look all over  for your sever. That was definitely not the case here. The food was excellent I got the brick chicken & my husband got the bone in rib eye steak. I'm usually not a steak person, like I don't even like Fogo De Chao. But the steak here @ this place was phenomenal!  I had the brick chicken & it was delicious so much flavor! Will definitely be back to visit this place next time I'm in Vegas! Go! You will not be disappointed",

We ordered Moscow mules at the bar while we waited for our table, they did not taste good, definitely missing something. Once seated, our waiter John recommended a bottle of red wine. It was delicious!! We started our meal with table side Cesar salad. It was very good. For our entrees, I had the cedar plank salmon with barley. It was very well prepared and flavorful. I liked the sundried tomatoes and other veggies, really made the dish. My hubby had the porterhouse. He enjoyed it, however, gave it a 7/10, found it under seasoned. John recommended both entrees, which we took him up on considering we were leaning towards pricier entrees. I figured if he was willing to suggest something cheaper, it was worth the try.  For our sides, we had the mashed potatoes and the grilled asparagus. The mashed potatoes were not good. They tasted like boxed mashed potatoes and had the same texture. For $10, I was expecting something better. The asparagus was really good. Overall a good experience, probably a bit overrated, but I would go back and try something new.",

While there are several good appetizers available if you are not quite that hungry you still can have a first course of their spaghetti and bread with a wonderful eggplant copanata. The filet mignon, my wife's favorite is melt in your mouth goodness. I can wholeheartedly recommend the ribeye and both become very special with the house zip sauce.

Our server Ioan, was charming and it was obvious he loved his job. The food was first rate.  Wife and I love to share at high end restaurants so we ordered three courses to share. Oysters to start. They were very good. I'd say go lite on the champagne provided to pour over the top of oysters, while tasty we found it to be over-powering, losing some of the flavor.  Second we had Caesar salad. Before you wonder why order a Caesar salad when you can get that anywhere, this is 100% authentic Caesar salad and it is prepared table side. Helps that our waiter told an excellent story while preparing the dish. Before the main course diners are treated to a signature bite of pasta that is absolutely scrumptious. Reminded me of one of my favorite comfort foods; tomato soup and grilled cheese. Lobster and Filet Mignon were our main course. We also ordered spinach and asparagus as sides to balance out the meal. The filet mignon was mouth-watering and delicate, but what made it so incredible was a soy-butter sauce that was drizzled over the cut, absolutely to die for. Lobster was prepared just right, not well done by any means. I would recommend both the spinach and asparagus sides to anyone dining here. The balsamic vinaigrette and caramelized pearl onions that topped the asparagus elevated the dish to something you savored. Fans of steamed spinach will not want to miss out either. Being our anniversary we were comped a deliciously delicate tiramisu. Lastly, we ordered two espressos that came with cute rock candy stirrers. Rich coffee that put an excellent cap on a perfect dinning experience.  For couples, I highly recommend asking for a booth, very intimate and worth the wait. Whether you are staying near the Fremont Experience or down on the Strip, Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse is well worth a shot. It is as good at any high-end restaurant in one of the pricey hotels on the strip.",

Do yourself a favor and either valet your car, or park above the Walgreens next to this restaurant because the parking structure has ~8 floors of reserved parking that made me dizzy.  My salad was one of the best caprese's I've ever had.  The filet mignon (with zip sauce) was wonderful, and they even gave us a free starter pasta dish.  I would absolutely 100% return here.",

    "text": "With literally over 500 places to eat in Las Vegas, this is without a doubt in the top ten.  I can say that with conviction due to the fact that I have eaten at nearly every highly rated restaurant in Vegas (from a 7 dollar a plate diner to some of the most expensive places on the Strip).   Knowing of the Andiamo name from living not too far from Detroit, my wife and I went for dinner on a Saturday evening.  Andiamo is located downtown inside The D Las Vegas.  When we were there, signage was not too visible, but it is at the top of the escalators to the second floor.  The decor is a nod to the way vegas restaurants used to be...dim lighting, quiet, private.  Some of the most popular places in Vegas, you literally have to yell to be heard by someone sitting 3 feet from you.  At Andiamo, all of the booths on the outer wall of the restaurant have walls that make it very quiet and private.  The detail in the decor stretches from the elaborate metal ceiling to the simple, yet elegant light fixtures.  It really creates a sense of calm and class in an otherwise loud and boisterous environment (Vegas)  The staff is excellent, with serving teams working in perfect harmony.  A water glass is never less than half full and service is very attentive without being stuffy and over the top.    Well, finally to the food...I don't eat salad, however my wife does and she raved about the freshness of the vegetables as well as the in-house made fresh mozzarella.  The variety of breads served at the table were freshly baked, warm, and moist, not something sitting under a heat lamp like in some restaurants.    I ordered Agnolotti with Palmina sauce at the recommendation of our server.  Agnolotti are handmade ravioli stuffed with a combination of pork and beef with Italian seasoning.  It is quite possibly the best pasta dish I have ever eaten.  The way the pork and beef in the pasta meshed with the lighter Palmino sauce was incredible.   Andiamo partners with the leading supplier of hormone free meats in the country and it shows.    After the incredible dessert tray is presented, we enjoyed a caramel cheesecake with hot caramel drizzled over the top.  It was out of this world.  Lots of classic Italian desserts are served also.  After our dessert was finished, the restaurant manager came over and asked if we had an enjoyable experience.  We made small talk for a while and shared with him how impressed we were with the entire experience from start to finish.  Prices are not inflated like they are in some Vegas restaurants.  For what you get out of the whole dining experience (service, ambiance, food, etc) it is likely the best bargain in the city.  Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse is truly a gem in Downtown Vegas, and is easily its best restaurant.  Hopefully The D increases signage to draw in people looking for an outstanding meal at a very fair price.  I truly think that if Mr. Vicari desires, he can open an outpost on the strip in a major resort, and you will will see a shift in the landscape of Italian food in Vegas.",

We started with the chunky eggplant olive spread and house made bread, breadsticks, crispy lovelies- yum! Don't fill up here though, you've got the main course coming! Moved on with table side Caesar salad that was deeelicious- made with extra TLC by our super server Sandy! The staff here are incredibly attentive but not annoyingly so.  Luis M was awesome at making sure we didn't need anything and offered the \"little things\" that just make your dining out like home, but better! Main courses were outstanding- I had the lobster risotto, but we both knew we couldn't finish our dinners.  I stopped early on mine and helped hubby finish his most excellent pappardelle.  One of the best meals we've EVER had!! Came home with a cannoli for later! The meal was made even better by the comps we were given when we went to the players club beforehand.  We each had a 25$ dining credit which brought our meal from 100 to 46$ after taxes.  Shut. Up. Ridiculous! We WON in Vegas!",

Knowing Mr. Lutz' expertise in all things culinary and oenological, I left it up to him to make the food and wine choices for us. Starting with a gorgeous Nebbiolo coupled with a nice olive and onion tapenade and crostini, then on to a beautiful Caesar salad prepared tableside; then, finishing with a very nice Amarone along with the Pappardelle - made of a hearty veal stew, battuto, tomatoes, Porcini mushrooms, white wine, handmade pasta, and Asiago cheese - this was an outstanding gastronomic event. Add to all that sophisticated, cosmopolitan ambiance, attentive, friendly staff (all), and very reasonable prices, Andiamo is a sensuous feast that shouldn't be missed if you want to do Vegas in style!",

    "text": "I took a party of 12 here for my fiancees birthday. I was a little hesitant because of the neighbourhood of Vegas that its in, but I didn't let that stop me as I heard great things about the food and service. In a city with 5 star restaurants lining the strip, a restaurant has to be damn good to hike 15 minutes in a limo. This is an old school place. From the moment you walk in you can almost taste \"old Vegas\". So much, that you feel like you might see Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin at the booth next to you. Our servers, John and Darren, the definition of True professionals. We ordered so many things so I'll just start naming everything that was truly \"game changing\": table side Caesar salad, meatballs, carpaccio, antipasto plate, osso bucco was UNREAL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, lobster risotto and the Dover sole might have stolen the show if it wasn't for a dessert they had called the kit-kat. I would recommend this place to any and everyone who enjoys old school service and decor with attention to detail that you just don't see too often anymore. The only drawback is the location which is definitely not a good part of town. If you go here walk straight to the restaurant and enjoy every bite, then get your ass back to the strip ASAP and brag to everyone about your hidden gem. Cheers to Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse. Ask for the GM Ulisses -- he'll take great care of you!",

One of their specialties is their homemade pasta by the Italian chef. For those of us getting entrees not including pasta, a special side dish was presents to 5 of us as a treat to sample. It was amazing.   One of our party is gluten-free and she was able to pick any of the pasta entrees and just sub the gluten-free pasta. Basket of bread was my lease favorite part of the meal - a little well done for my taste, but the cheese bread sticks were yummy. Homemade olive tapenade plated instead of butter, but butter was pleasantly presented upon request.   We had a special birthday in our party and they treated her accordingly with song and the most wonderful piece of cheesecake.  Try to save room for dessert.  All our choices were great and the presentation on the plate only added to it.  My sister-in-law said the tiramisu was among the top two she has ever tasted.",

When we arrived we were seated at a regular table but it was off to the side and rather private.  About 5 min after we were seated, the hostess returned and said she just saw our request for a booth and asked us if we wanted to be moved.  Since the table was nice, we didn't make a fuss about it and decided to stay.  Our waiter, John, was outstanding and we were happy we had stayed!  He was very \"old school\" and we felt like we were being served by someone who has seen it all and been around - super cool guy!   We ordered the meatball as an appetizer and wow this was amazing!  I almost wished I had skipped my meal and ordered a 2nd but then I would have missed out on a wonderful steak!  Oh the choices!  We were also given a complementary pasta dish (thin spaghetti with a light creamy tomato sauce) before our steaks arrived that was also very good!  Our meals arrived and I did find my \"well-done\" steak was a little undercooked for my taste but I didn't say anything because it passed my taste bud test and was very good.  At the end of the meal, John brought out a complementary Tiramisu dessert and wished me a happy birthday.  It was a nice surprise and a wonderful way to end the night!   This place had the best vibe and service.  I know that this will be our steak place next time we come to town!",

He answered our questions, made a few recommendations and very specific suggestions that were spot on.  The Caesar salad that was prepared our our table was a knock out - the charbroiled steak was expertly prepared and their fresh Tortellaci Guiseppe melted in your mouth.  We also got 2 side dishes; 1 jumbo meatball and roasted mushrooms.    While we were savoring each bite .. the manager stopped by to make sure we were satisfied.

The food this time was just ok. Having said that, it wouldn't deter me from going back as I'd eaten there before and it was excellent. It really went south the next day. Everyone of us got sick. Very sick. We all had different dishes so I can't point to one particular menu item. Here we are three weeks later and my daughter and I are still dealing with the fallout from that meal.

I had a few glasses of wine, but I do wish they had a bigger selection of Italian wine by the glass. Nothing from Piedmont Region by the glass? They gotta fix that. Otherwise, everything was good. Caesar salad was good and huge. Meatball was tasty, even though I am just not a ricotta fan. We ended up splitting a porterhouse and it was excellent, especially with the truffle whipped potatoes. Overall good service and a good meal.",

    "text": "All of the previous reviews are very accurate- this is a phenomenal restaurant with wonderful decor and ambiance! It's perfect for a date, to celebrate a birthday/anniversary, a night out to catch up with friends, etc.   I went during my last trip to Las Vegas to celebrate my best friend's birthday. He had previously been there and had nothing but wonderful things to say (went as far as saying it was one of the best meals he had ever had, so of course we had to try it)! We had to change our reservation multiple times (our plans kept changing due to a long hike, cab problems, etc) and the hosts were nothing but accommodating and understanding!   The service was great! We were seated soon after arriving and were promptly greeted and the service throughout the meal was just as good.   As far as drinks go, we didn't order any bottles of wine since we were going out after - ordered vodka drinks from the bar (hard to mess up- and were strong, so we were happy).  The food was delicious! The complimentary bread/breadsticks and tapenade were flavorful and delicious! We started with the \"Andiamo Grande Meatball\" - super tender, with fresh tomato sauce and ricotta cheese - extremely delicious! We got the caesar salad - where they come with the cart and hand make it (everything! including the dressing) in front of you. It was awesome to watch and was delicious for the most part (I got a few chunks of anchovy - my friend didn't - which was unfortunate and ruined the rest of my plate for me - but still overall tasty). (My other friend got a house salad and enjoyed it)  For the entree, I ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast (stuffed with ricotta, sundries tomatoes, and spinach) with a side of onions and mushrooms. The chicken was delicious - although I wished there was more of the stuffing - and the side was just okay. Not bad, but not as flavorful as I would have hoped. The birthday boy ordered the filet with a side of asparagus and loved everything about his meal and our other friend ordered the Agnolotti pasta and enjoyed it, as well.  I let the waiter know that it was my friends birthday and they brought out a complimentary cake (rum cake? Not sure, but we could taste rum and it was absolutely delicious!!) They usually bring around a cart of desserts to choose from, which they didn't since they gave us the cake. I kind of wish they still did (I probably would have indulged in more), but it's probably a good thing they didn't!   To end the meal, we ordered the espresso! Amazing!! It comes with a sugar rock candy on a stick that you can stir in the espresso and dissolve. Loved ending my meal with this!!   Overall, great experience! I know my friend will be back since he lives there now, and I think it's highly likely that I will be back when I'm visiting!",

    "text": "Had this place on my bookmark list for quite some time. Fantastic reviews and pictures  It is located in downtown Vegas of which I am not really a fan. Made a reservation, arrived at the time reserved and were promptly seated. Not a very large place. Had an old school atmosphere with all of the waiters in white dinner jackets. As I have been known to do, we started with a few cocktails to help us go over their menu offerings. Here is what we ordered. A type of Kale / Farro salad. A Wedge salad (for me, I like old school) Frutti di Mare, and a bone-in rib-eye. The salads were pretty good with the wedge being a bit different from the standard but was still good. On the entrees.......they were just ok. The steak was good but was definitely not prime beef but priced as high as prime. The Frutti di Mare was only ok too.   This may sound strange but they had the most awesome breadsticks I ever had. They were about as thin as a pencil and had something on them or in them that made me want more.  People here wrote highly of their wait service but we did not experience it. Our waiter seemed distracted and was more interested in a larger group table that he was helping out on.  I really wanted to like this place more but I have to be honest and say it fell short on food and service for us. I thought it was only OK.  Would I go back? If someone else is picking up the tab for sure.  Cheers to all",

    "text": "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and you are hoping the memory of this meal stays there too!  Listen up party people a rule of thumb to be safe should be to look at the hotel the restaurant is located in, in a place like Vegas. There are of course exceptions to all rules . This place isn't one of them.  My friend suggested the place and he's a local so I said OK. The staff service etc. was good but it boils down to what your knife and fork are cutting. Appetizers mediocre, famous meatball mediocre, calamari mediocre . That was at least better than the steaks that were mediocre minus at best. My steaks temp was wrong twice and had no flavor, famous side of gnocchi mediocre all entrees mediocre. Can't get that word out of my head from that meal.  How does a place like this get all those stars? I have a few thoughts . 1. again the reviewers just don't know food . To be honest it's probably True their thoughts are shaped by other reviewers or the media or they want to be part of social media and honestly anyone qualified or unqualified can post .   2. Many people who eat Applebee's come to Vegas and this is an upgrade for them ,I think, and they don't have a real point of reference, think Peter Lugers.  The other bizarre part is the price is Luger like , maybe same definitely not more but it's an extra tragedy at what they are charging. 3. I can't blame it on food talking heads fooling people to believe just because it's on a show since I've never seen this place on any show. Give them time they are running out of junky places .  To a hungry person, every bitter food is sweet. When the preferable is not available, the available becomes preferable!  True in life and food  NOTORIOUS",

When I told my attentive waiter Miguel that I was ordering Veal Osso Bucco as my entree, he closed his eyes, tipped his head back, and placed his hands over his heart almost in reverence at my choice.  And it really was great, rich tomatoey-flavored, fall off the bone Osso Bucco.  One of the very best I have experienced!  But even before then there were other fine moments.  Pasta Fagioli with Ditalini pasta was good but not real hot.  Calamari Fritti was golden and delicious.  Italian Sausages with very soft Banana Peppers and Potatoes bathed in a red Tomato Sauce made for a great appetizer.  Tableside tossed Ceasar Salad with fine croutons, anchovy, egg, garlic, lemon, olive oil, and Reggiano Cheese was simply excellent.  And, later, sauteed Button Mushrooms and Onions and Tuscan Roasted Potatoes also with Onions rounded out a memorable meal.    A cartful of desserts looked quite delectable.  But, alas, there was no more room.  So, my party of four passed on these tempting selections.  There will be no argument from me to contest the claim that Andiamo is the best fine dining restaurant to be found in downtown Las Vegas today!",

My husband and I are very young and sometimes I've noticed we won't get the same service as others at some places because they don't think we'll tip, but that definitely wasn't the case with Danny. The Caesar salad required two people to order it because the waiter actually has to make the whole salad and dressing at the table. I wasn't in the mood for a salad but my husband really wanted a Caesar salad, but opted for the wedge because of the two person minimum. Danny went above and beyond and still made the salad for my husband and even offered to split it to share some with me. That shows me amazing customer service. Working in the food industry I completely know what good service takes. Danny also asked us about ourselves and the occasion and we talked for a but. He even brought us out a anniversary dessert at the end.   I order the chargrilled lamb chops and my husband had the lobster risotto.. Both were amazing.   The food was excellent and service was also promising.   Danny & the server assistant Luis were amazing.",

The medallions themselves were nice and tender and delish, but the sauce almost ruined them. My husbands bone-in ribeye also had some sort of sauce on it and crispy onions that took away from the steak itself. He said it did not cut like butter and tasted like it had been previously vacuum sealed and frozen. Will not be returning.",

While our server was very nice and friendly, the person who actually brought out our steak made a joke that, while I'm sure he meant for it to be funny, was kinda rude and borderline offensive. A for effort for F for execution.  I think you can find better value for your money.",

    "text": "Okay, 4.5.  Headed up to downtown on a Vegas stay, especially for dinner at Andiamo. This is a gem hidden well away from the big lights on the Strip, but it's worth the visit. Classic steakhouse with exceptional food, great atmosphere, no blasting music, and a lovely staff. We were four, but only about 2.5 of use ate. Two of us had Caesar Salads (made tableside), split the Tomahawk, and a side of Tuscan roasted potatoes. The salad was nice, not great, the steak was amazing and perfectly cooked, the potatoes excellent. There was an order of lobster risotto that got a thumbs up, and one wedge salad. Two wines. Get steak. You go here for steak. Split a Tomahawk that's cut at your table - as good a steak as I've ever had. Ran about $200 before tip. I'd guess that four eating steak, with salad, sides and wine would run about $325. It's worth it.",

I'm not sure how we found this place but it's tucked away at the D but I was so sick of eating oily rich foods that I wanted something a little different. Enter steaks, Italian food and wine. Yay. Traditional steak house flair with a kiss of modern. Steak...gnocchi....caprese salad and damn that bread. So, so good. Only way to make it better was if they served it up with a little evoo, but the eggplant it was served with was delicious. Service was exceptional and we didn't wait more than three minutes to be seated. I'm happy we found this place and I would definitely go back.",

I will say this was the best decision we have made in our foodie lives. The waitress was so knowledgeable and polite. She gave great suggestions and pairing to go with. We had the lobster risotto and the lobster tail surf and turf. It was amazing, plus when she found out it was my birthday she brought out cake even though we were in a rush to go on the zipline. I really appreciated it and her customer service made me feel like I wasn't even at a bar. If I could give more stars I would.

The sausages are made in house.  The caesar is made table side and is great.  The meat is dry aged at least 30 days.  They have great handmade pastas.

Wow, were the other reviews RIGHT!!!  Very nice, fairly quiet, newly remodeled dining room. Old school leather chairs and waiters in white tuxedo jackets.  Bread was great. Tampenade was great.  Service is friendly, attentive, and very service-oriented.  Old school service.  House-made sausage & peppers were fantastic.  Bone-in ribeye was one of the finest steaks I've ever eaten. Great wine list. Huge yummy loaded baked potato.  Courtesy portion of pasta and sauce was delicious.  Desserts looked awesome, but we were too stuffed to try them.  Not cheap (especially for Fremont Street), but they were busy and everyone had a great meal.  So good I would take a taxi from the strip just to dine here again.

Food:  Appetizers - Bread and dipping sauce was delicious. My parents, wife, and brother all ordered the Caesar salad made table side.  Miguel took his time, let us know what he was putting in and it turned out awesome. I ordered the grande meatball and it was perfect.  Main Dish - I ordered the Bone-In ribeye steak, medium rare. Came to the table perfectly cooked to my liking. My wife had the filet with lobster tail. The lobster was delightful and not over cooked. Filet cooked perfect. Mushrooms and Onions went along perfect.  Dessert - We all sampled each other's desserts. My wife and I had the ricotta cheesecake and it was delightful. My brother had the creme brulee and it was delicious.   What we really enjoyed, besides the awesome food, was the fact that we weren't rushed. We sat there and enjoyed the ambiance and each other's company with out being pressured to hurry up and leave. Miguel was a perfect server and host. His knowledge of the menu was superb.   We will be back in December for the George Strait concert to celebrate our anniversary and we will for sure be headed back to this place. Thank you for an awesome experience!  **Side Note. The signature cocktails were perfect.  Pretty much, this  place is perfect",

He definitely took care of us. He made sure we were happy and checked on us multiple times. After we finished our appetizers, they removed all of our plates and even replaced all of our silverware (which is a new thing for me). Our water was constantly refilled. Even our runner was awesome! His name was Marcos. He was extremely nice and helpful.   Food: 5 out of 5  As soon as we were seated, Miguel brought us some bread and some dipping sauce. Honestly, the dipping stuff was awesome, I just had no idea what was in it  We ordered calamari to start. It was cooked perfectly. Nice and tender and perfect.   Our steak was cooked to perfection. Even the vegetable reduction was so tasty. I was overall satisfied with everything. The chef heard about our anniversary and sent us out a desert as complimentary from the restaurant. I was extremely happy with everything and I will always recommend this to everyone.",

    "text": "Our first visit to The D Hotel in the old part of Las Vegas and Freemont Street.  We had tickets for the show \"Defending The Caveman\" and decided to have dinner at Andiamo.  What a great hidden find and treasure! The entrance is tucked away and had we not already done an internet search for restaurants in or near the D, we would not have found Andiamo.  Bill was our waiter and was terrific, please ask for him to be your server.  We started with two Grey Goose martinis (perfectly made and chilled with extra olives).  A wonderful basket of breads and hand crafted bread sticks appeared as well as a scrumptious amuse de bouche of eggplant caponata.  We ordered the special, a large bone-in rib steak (caveman sized to go with the show!) and it was big enough to share.  It came with a wonderful side of potato gnocchi with peas and an Alfredo style sauce.  We ordered two glasses of Malbec wine...delicious!  No room for dessert although the desserts on display were very tempting.  In True Las Vegas style, we made it disappear!  Near by tables ordered the Caesar Salad prepared at tableside.  Both the creation and service was worthy.  The salad looked beautiful and sparked other tables to order the same.  Another couple ordered the Lobster Bisque which had an enticing aroma.  Judging by the gentleman's expression as he took his first sip, the flavor must have been devine.    A great dining room, beautiful, cozy and handsomely decorated.  Old Vegas class, style and quality.  One of the best meals we have ever had anywhere!  Give it a try!",

We had the ribeye yum! I am spoiled with only the best steaks and these were perfect. Seemed to have a white butter sauce with it and oh my god..ur mouth waters. Their appetizers were complimentary I guess. They make their drinks strong and yummy. The tables are half circle and very nice to cuddle and talk. Enjoyed this place to the max and highly recommend it. Tip the guys well they deserve it.",

    "text": "An Italian Steakhouse so AMAZING even John Gotti would have approved!  Andiamo, located inside The D casino in downtown LV is one of only a few hidden gems left in a city that was better ran by the mob!  It is difficult to pull me away from my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, but since I found myself in Sin City twice within 3 weeks I decided to expand my horizons and try Andiamo with NO disappointment!   THE DECOR: A tastefully designed upscale steakhouse with some of the most private feeling and luxurious booths one will ever encounter in a restaurant!  A GREAT eye for design.  THE SERVICE: While the service in Las Vegas has slowly sunk into the sand, the service at this restaurant was simply OUTSTANDING!  Ask for Darren, he will take excellent care of you as he did us.  He will ensure you not only have a great meal, but also a memorable dining experience.  THE FOOD: (See attached photographs) For starters, Andiamo has without a doubt the BEST meatball on the planet!  A meatball so juicy, flavorful, and tender it will simply melt in your mouth!  Although the size of a softball, I would order 2 as they go quick no matter how hungry your party is \"Utah!.........get me 2!!\"  Next, the Sausage & Peppers are to DIE for!  Again, one of the best I have ever had.  So good I still wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweats dreaming of them!  The Chef didn't miss a single ingredient in this dish and is nothing less than SPECTACULAR!    For the main courses we ordered 2 chops.  Andiamo serves dry aged meats that are out of this world; Aged to PERFECTION!  My compliments to the Chef.  We ordered the impressive Tomahawk Steak, which is actually a bone-in rib eye (so called because of its resemblance to a tomahawk) and it comes to the table still SIZZLING in the skillet.  A SUPERB steak that needs no special sauces or added herbs.  I highly recommend it.  We also ordered the Porterhouse chop (Both the NY and Filet cuts) this too was an amazing steak with plenty of flavor and the most tender Porterhouse I have ever sank a steak knife into.    THE DESSERT: For dessert we ordered 3 things (Might as well go down in flames) First was the Coconut cake that was unparalleled to just about any dessert known to man (Or woman) I am an avid fan of GOOD coconut desserts (I can drink sun tan lotion straight out of the bottle)  This is simply HEAVEN!  Next we ordered the Kit Kat dessert which has spoiled me for life as I can never eat that plastic wrapped candy bar again.  Say no more.  The last dessert was a chocolate cake of sorts, as I am not a huge fan of chocolate cake, this certainly filled the void.  It is a chocolate dream for those that can appreciate it!    THE COFFEE: What TRUE Italian restaurant would be complete without Lavazza Coffee.  Simply the BEST coffee in North America!  A PERFECT way to compliment your meal and dinning experience!  THE BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a TOP steakhouse and incredible Italian food, Andiamo is the BEST of both worlds!  An upscale Italian steakhouse that is sure to please even the toughest steak connoisseur like myself.  I always judge a good steakhouse by how many mobsters got whacked outside (i.e. \"Sparks\" - Paul Castellano).  While it is True that Las Vegas was better ran by the mob, if the mob still owned this city today, there would certainly be some Tommy guns outside Andiamo waiting for today's Godfather to finish his last meal.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I have read in numerous reviews before going here that it is a hidden gem, and I will strongly agree that it is just that!  You will know what I mean if you go there, trust me.   The D Hotel was a bit dark and depressing with clientele that looked like something from Here Comes Honey Boo Boo (no offense to any fans of the D or to Honey Boo Boo...and what does the D stand for anyway? I could get creative, but I will stop).  Eek!    When you find Andiamo nestled back in a smoky corner on the second level, you walk into an entirely different world.  White linens, romantic lighting, cozy booths, \"Sinatra\" smooth and classy setting.  We had a large party and they rose to the occasion and we were all amazed at the service before any food was even consumed.    We started with the infamous Meatball and it was pretty good, nothing out of this world, but good.  We shared a few other appetizers that were good as well.  Then the steak came, and WOW!  Everyone at the table stated that this was the best steak they had ever had.  Now, we are Midwesterners, True meat connoisseurs, so this was a quite a moment.  Cooked perfectly, melt in your mouth, like butter...  If you are in Las Vegas and looking for a steakhouse, this is the place. It is expensive but well worth it!  I have been to Vegas probably 30 times and have eaten at plenty of the other high-end steak houses and Andiamo kicks their ASS!",

    "text": "Definitely didn't have a raving time as everyone else did. Lol. But for the prices on the menu, I had expected a far higher standard of quality for food and service. (Btw, this place is located in some hotel called the D which secretes an aroma of old casino smell that is both nostalgic and musty in a bad way...)  FOOD: Boyfriend and I ordered the Brick Chicken ($32.00), Side Meatballs ($9.00), and Bone-In NY Steak ($43.00~), they also extra charged us an Antipasti Meatball ($11.00) which were bigger versions of the side meatballs. The Brick Chicken while doused in a very flavorful olive oil sauce was overcooked and very dry. Only saving grace to the dish was the portion was big and the vegetables and fingerling potatoes that came with it were very well cooked. The Antipasti Meatballs (Also comes as smaller portion side meatballs) were subpar at best, the texture was weird and grainy, the flavor of meat and marinara sauce were also bland. The side meatballs were tiny (a little bit bigger than dollar coins) and only comes with 2 for $9.00. As for the NY steak, it was charred beyond belief that it just tasted burnt, plus it came with literally just a slab of meat on a plate, no garnish or even some greens to complement the meat.  SERVICE: All our waiters were very kind and friendly, and were super accommodating to us and our friends I really do appreciate them for their hard work. But for the amount of money we were patronizing to this restaurant, not to mention they prided themselves as a high class restaurant I would expect them to remember to input all our orders. My appetizer of side meatballs didn't come out till we were basically done with our entree, 2 hours later-- they were forgotten earlier. Then there was a miscommunication when we asked where our side meatballs were, one of the waiters had mistakened it for Antipasti meatball and charged us for another dish.  ATMOSPHERE: It's pretty cozy place with dim lighting and servers in nice, clean white suits serving you. But upon closer inspection some areas seemed like it wasn't well kept. Some of our folded napkins were ripped and tattered when opened, the large curtains cascading down the ceiling were heavy and cumbersome, and it seemed almost dusty as well.  I personally wouldn't come back as I've been to plenty of other high end steakhouses on The Strip that has better professional service, with cleaner and newer facilities/decor, better quality of food for the kind of prices they're charging at Andiamo. :/",

We had to ask where our waiter was after being seated and then was told by the hostess she forgot to tell a waiter we were seated.  We had waited 20 minutes and all we received was water.  There were many employees who walked by us and didn't even acknowledge us.   Then even after we were told our waiter would be with us, we still had to wait another 10 minutes.   Our waiter checked on us once during our meal.  When our leftovers were packed, they were placed in a plastic take out bag that you normally get at a fast food take out place.   This wouldn't have been a problem had I not seen every other person leave with a custom paper bag.  The food was okay but not good enough to make up for the terrible service.",

    "text": "Sick of the strip but still want a decent steak meal?!? I'd like recommend coming here my fellow meat head.   Located in the new hip The D Casino just toward the end of Fremont blvd.  parking is $3 bucks per hour after 4 hours validation at the D club.  The parking structure is very tight and you're limited to only certain floors.  I've realized after walking the Fremont Blvd. that there are free parking lots around other casinos.    The restaurant is located upstairs.  The entrance reminds me of a small tunneling cave.  We were there an hour before their closing time and it was super packed.  I figured  everybody was seeking a good piece of steak as well.  We waited roughly twenty minutes.  So I do recommend making reservation beforehand.    Moving on to the food.    For starters we ordered two colossal shrimp cocktail @ $5 each.  Compared to places like Maestros, it was a steal.  The shrimp was big, hence the name COLOSSAL, juicy and fresh.  Very refreshing and nicely presented.  I would not pass on this!!!  We also order a wedge salad but came out as chopped salad.  Omg it was so delicious.  My partner commented that it was the best she ever had.  I personally had better.   I ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare with their special house sauce on the side.  Good beef requires no sauce is my personal take.  The steak looked so beautiful.  It had the almost perfect colorations.  It smelled delicious as well with the seasonings just glistering at me.  First cut as I see the pinkness I knew and announced to my dinner date that this is gonna be Good!!  The chef also treated me to a homemade vodka sauce side pasta.  It was yummy and, naturally, I consumed it all.    My lovely and apparently hungry date ordered the Agnolotti and side sausage.  The Agnolotti was stuffed pasta with veal with this super rich butter sauce.  I was afraid for my heart to try it.  She was only able to eat half since it was so rich and just okay tasting.  Now the side sausage she got was actually pretty impressive.  It came with two big juicy sausages drenched in this savory robust marinara sauce.  I remember taking a bite of the sausage and wanting to lick the bowl clean because the sauce was so good.  We finished our meal with a cup of cappuccino that was foamy and good but a tad overpriced.  The service was just okay for a 3 dollar sign establishment.  It wasn't bad, but a wedge salad does not sound any where close to a chopped salad but overall the food made up for it.    I would come here again if I'm ever in town, but I can't lie, I'm still open to trying Hugo.  I do really appreciate that this place opens til 11pm though.",

    "text": "Went for dinner with my mother before a show in the Smiths Center which was nearby. Restaurant was very clean, intimate, nice with long private booths. Service was good like any other fancy steakhouse but the food  was even greater. Prices and portions were very reasonable. Had portabello mushroom appetizer, 24 oz porterhouse, baked potato, side of sprouts, 2 canollis, and cappuccinos for about 140.00. The sides were a great size thought they were going to be small portion luckily server advised me before me over ordering. The baked potato with all the fixings was one of the best i ever tried very soft and creamy with lots of flavor. The steak did not disappoint with their signature zip sauce and to our surprise with the steak order came a small bowl of chefs special pasta that looked kinda like spaghetti but wasnt and was very good the portion wasnt too much to spoil our appetites for the rest of the meal. My mom is not into fancy steakhouses but she certainly loved this one and wants to come back. I chose this out of all the other selections downtown due to the great reviews and the pictures of their steaks and dishes looked so good and with so much flavor. Was very pleased will come back again next show!!",

If I were at a $9.99 place I may have asked for a refund, but was too embarrassed for them to actually say it was that horrible.  The service was good, but was trying too hard to be upscale.  I was using a comp, we had used to comp there a few years ago and I ordered the pasta because...housemade pasta.  It was uneventful. I get another comp.  peruse the menu.  It doesn't look exciting and I have a hard time believing the steaks are going to be high end.  So I decide to go alone and \"waste\" the comp, but not spend double to take the hubby and he doesn't want to go either.  Neither of us were impressed last time.  It was \"fine\".   I ordered the steak and portobello bites with the sauce and onion straws.  The onion straws were the best part. The sauce was good, but salty and not change my life. I ordered a side of the truffle mashed, they literally were worse than hospital cafeteria.  Dry, bland, dense. They tasted like bad instant.  The bread basket was good.  I had saved for dessert, instead of salad because the salads sound blah.   I had enough for two.  I ordered the creme brulee and ate it in house.  It was good.  I actually ate it all because I had bagged half my meal for the hubby because it wasn't good. I ordered the cheesecake to bring home and haven't tried it.  I'm just not getting all these rave reviews.",

He was very understanding and so cool. It was a table of about 9 of us and we didn't wait long for our order.  I had the steak (medium rare) and it was very succulent and full of flavor. I can't speak for the rest of my table but they also finished everything on the table so I'm assuming it was great as well. No complaints here , I'll be back on my next visit to Vegas",

The brick entrance begins your experience and we had a really great time!   Pauly our server had a big personality and we really enjoyed our time with him. These guys know their stuff and the white jackets offer a very elegant touch. The vibe was modern meets classic and the cozy restaurant makes you feel very comfortable.  The food... Everything was great but I wasn't blown away by the colossal shrimp cocktail which wasn't so colossal, the white truffle whipped potatoes as I've had way better and the tiramisu which needed more coffee liquor.   However I was blown away by the Sicilian caponata, table-side Caesar, grande meatball with ricotta & red sauce (so moist & flavorful), house pasta with a decadent pink sauce, the 20 ounce bone-in rib eye (enough for two), and the side sauce that stole the show...the balsamic glaze with cipollini onions. I could drink this sauce...wow! We poured it over nearly everything...  So even though I wasn't blown away by each dish, we loved our experience and as we sat there enjoying every bite we were already planning our return. That's how good it was!",

The manager was also there that night greeting guests. We made reservations through OpenTable so we were seated right away. Our server - Danny - was awesome. He had a cool east coast accent that was entertaining. He told us the specials and gave us his honest opinion of what is the best to try!   We ordered the following:   1. Fried Calamari  2. Medium rare Ribeye w/ the zip sauce on the side  3. Truffle Mashed potatoes  4. Asparagus  5. Tiramisu   All of it was delicious!! I definitely want to come back here again w/ my girlfriend. The meat was tender and full of flavor. The calamari was perfectly fried yet tender. The mashed potatoes were fluffy and creamy with fairly large truffle shavings. Asparagus was also good.   Tiramisu is probably the best I've ever had in Vegas. It's made fresh w/ an amazing whipped cream on the side that's thick!   Highly recommend! If you're looking for a nice fine dining restaurant that really delivers quality and service, then I recommend coming here. Enjoy!",

We were staying at the D hotel for this weekend and decided to give this restaurant a shot. So glad we did. We started with the escargot served in a mushroom cap which were very good. For entree's my mom had the surf and turf, steak and lobster and was excellent. My mom likes her steak well done, which was done exactly as she prefers and a large lobster tail which we could not finish. My daughter had the lobster risotto which was perfect. I had the fruits de Mari, lots of shell fish, clams, mussels, squid and shrimp in a spicy tomato base. Loved it.   Most important was the service. Wow, we can't thank the staff enough. My mom is in a wheelchair and they were so accommodating. Table service was excellent as well. We ate a lot of great food this thanksgiving weekend in Vegas, but this place surpassed all our expectations and all of us said it was our best meal. Can't wait to go back again next thanksgiving!",

Our waiter was Lou, keep this man around because service is key in a restaurant. The restaurant is well kept, romantic, and cozy, the booth was extremely private and romantic. We ordered some wine and the meat and cheese platter first , it did not disappoint and the variation was well appreciated. Next we ordered the veal osso bucco, it practically melted when I touched it with the fork, the homemade pasta was SO good. We ordered the surf and turf as well, with bacon Brussel sprouts, and truffle mashed potatoes SO GOOD. we shared two desserts the Creme brulee and the cannoli also SO good. Throughout the night Lou Served us promptly and enthusiastically. He smiled and had great persona when he interacted with us and because of his service he helped make our dinner memorable and we hope to be back soon. I will gladly recommend this place for a wonderful romantic dinner",

    "text": "Atmosphere: It is located in downtown Las Vegas, and it has an interesting/old school/classy feel to the place. We were actually struggling locating it in the casino and a pleasant young gentlemen in the janitorial crew assisted us to the location. The entire time he was talking about how wonderful the restaurant was and how impressed we will be since it was our first time dining there. We went inside and announced our name and reservation. They gave away our table. Granted we were 12 minutes late, but it is Las Vegas traffic, it is hard to predict what is going to happen when you step into a vehicle. They lead us to the bar assuring it would only be a 10 to 15 minute wait. My fiance was upset and let them know of his displeasure, he had worked at several fine dining establishments and it is a standard practice in most places to hold a table for 15 minutes. They retrieved our group from the bar only 5 minutes later and gave us an amazing table (honestly was probably the best seat in the house in our opinion). The night was saved.   Service: Our server Miguel was fantastic. His passion for his job was abundantly clear, and he could tell you anything about that drink and dinner menu. He was on top of his game the entire evening. He recommended a few wines for us and gave us additional information on the wine that we chose to order while serving it to us. He even let us save the cork.  Food: My fiance and I split the lobster bisque and it was divine. So much flavor packed into every mouthful. The chunks of lobster on top were insanely tender and fresh. I had the chilean seabass entree, and it was cooked quite well (a tad bit over). I felt the dish was missing a bright note, maybe some citrus or fresh herbs perhaps? Half the table had the Paglia e Fieno and the Tortellaci Guiseppe, and agreed it was fresh, handmade, savory and perfectly sauced. The last member of our group had the veal osso bucco. It was the best dish of the night. Sooooo much flavor and he gave me the bone marrow. I smeared that all over a piece of bread from their complimentary bread basket (the best bread basket I've had in a while) and was in heaven. Best bone marrow I've had to date, hands down.  If I come back to Vegas, this will be a definite revisit. The evening could not have been more memorable and magical to celebrate our new engagement.",

First, we came in right at the time of our reservation and were immediately greeted and seated in a luxurious booth. I loved the set-up of the restaurant, and the booth seemed almost private although there were tables around us. Our server, Jhonny, attended to our every need. I served tables in various restaurants for almost ten years, so I am very appreciative of great service. We never waited for a drink or refill, and he was always around to check on us. He even offered to take a picture of us without us asking!   As far as food goes.. I am still in awe of how flavorful and tender my filet mignon was. I am a huge steak fanatic, and I can honestly say that I have never tasted a more delicious steak. I'm not sure what the \"zip sauce\" had in it, but it paired so well with the cut of meat! I was seriously on cloud 9. We also ordered dessert after our meal, and my fiance had asked Jhonny if he could possibly put a candle in it since it was my birthday. Not only did our server bring us the dessert we ordered, he brought ANOTHER dessert with a candle at no charge to us!   I am kind of a foodie and I have been to many different restaurants in different locales. My experience at Andiamo Steakhouse has been my favorite by far!",

    "text": "Visited Andiamo for our \"rehearsal night dinner\" before our Vegas wedding. Let me tell you it was outstanding! Hugo, our waiter was exceptional; friendly, attentive and professional. Even took a picture for us!  We've had a lot of arancini in our day (I mean a lot... it's my \"death row food\") and these were by far the best I've ever had. The perfect crunchiness to the crust, a creamy and flavorful arborio center and perfectly seasoned.  The sea bass was delicate, cooked to perfection and delicious. My lobster risotto was equally outstanding.  Highly recommend!",

We started off with the Cesar salad prepared table-side. It was our first time having homemade Cesar salad dressing, and a neat experience to watch our waiter to prepare it. The dressing is made of anchoy, egg, garlic, lemon, olive oil and parmigiano-reggiano which was so rich, creamy and delicious. Hubby had the long bone ribeye served with house-made gnocchi array.  The steak was flavorful, tender, perfectly medium and such a nice presentation of the long bone ribeye steak. I had the fresh pan-roasted sea scallops with ricotta gnocchi, asparagus, sweet corn and white truffle essence. We had no room for dessert since the food was so rich, delicious and filling. We highly recommend that you experience Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse while visiting Vegas.",

I had to stop myself from eating the entire bread basket with soft butter. I had the chopped salad and the Paglia e Fieno, chicken with prosciutto de Parma, peas and spinach linguine in the best white wine cream sauce I ever had. I wish I'd had more time in Vegas because the steaks that others ordered looked delicious. Although we were so full, we shared the coconut cake and soooo glad! It was so good. I cannot wait to go back.",

My girlfriend ordered there most popular steak which was the 20oz ribeye she asked for it to be cooked medium rare. It came out easily well done and looked dry as hell. We didn't bother mentioning it to our server because it took really long before all our food came out we were just hungry. In comparison to the latter two restaurants I mentioned above the plates came out sizzling hot. At Andiamo the plates came out warm and you can tell our pasta was sitting for awhile before everything were probably done.   I had high expectations for this place. Unfortunately they did not deliver like Mastro or Steak44.",

I made reservations here months in advance bc my mom didn't want to leave the Fremont are during our trip. From service to food we were completely blown away. Jhony was our server and he alone made our experience a great one.  Very attentive, took time to chit chat with us in his downtime, amazing recommendations with wine and entrees. I'm surprised my mom didn't kidnap him and being him back to Hawaii with us. I'm not going to go into much detail with how exquisite the food was or how everything we ordered was delicious, but I will say that the food was prepared so well that we literally ate everything in it's entirety regardless if it felt like our stomachs were gonna burst.  That may not be a huge testimony to some but my mom eats like a bird so.. compliments to the Chef! Prices weren't bad at all. Everything in the picture (including tip) came out to $300. We just overall have a truly wonderful experience and I would definitely stay Downtown again just to eat here more than once on a trip.",

    "text": "So, we should've known that the service was going to be terrible when we checked-in for our reservations with the host. We checked-in 30 minuets early in hopes that we  could be seated early (we were a group of four), but unfortunately she said that they are busy and we couldn't be seated at the moment and to return at our reservation time. BUT a couple walked in and when asked if they had reservations, they stated they did not, and the host seated them within several minutes! WTF! Sooo, since we had our hearts set on this place, we decided to oversee that incident walked out to gamble for a bit and returned at the time of our reservation.  We finally sat down and quickly noticed we were surrounded by two large groups (both parties seemed to be bachelor parties as the groups were all men and they were hammered) which impacted the level of service we received. Our food seemed like it took forever and when it finally arrived, it was a bit underwhelming. The baked potato and lobster were good, but my filet mignon was overcooked/burnt. A bit disappointing overall. The husbands enjoyed their tomahawk ribeye, but he was a bit upset that you had to purchase all the sides separately which ended up in a $600+ bill (plus tip) for a group of four.  For the level of customer service, the burnt filet mignon and extremely high prices, this was a first and a last for us. Unfortunately we will not be returning.",

    "text": "We came to Andiamo's on Super Bowl Weekend with friends for a good meal and conversation - not the best time for a local to venture downtown for a quiet meal. The place was packed with about 15 people waiting for a table in the hallway leading to the restaurant. We had a reservation specifying a quiet table. Didn't think they could honor it considering the din coming from the main dining area. But honor it they did. They have booths with 5 foot high seat-backs that provide a semi-private, quiet dining area.  Shortly after sitting, they brought a bread basket with an eggplant compote. The bread basket had a cheese loaf, bread sticks and crisps. The cheese bread with the compote on it - WOW! Hard to stop eating that to save room for the meal. My wife and I shared a wedge salad and a 20 ounce bone in ribeye. The wedge was your standard wedge with bacon crumbles, egg slices, and bleu cheese dressing. Quite good. Our friends had the chopped salad with a house dressing that was fabulous. The ribeye was presented sliced which made sharing much easier. Perfect preparation. Outstanding piece of meat. We got a side of button mushrooms with onion. Another outstanding dish. And they brought a small side of pasta compliments of the chef. The pasta was nothing special taste-wise, but a nice touch.  An outstanding dining experience worth the price. We will be coming back.",

Andiamo is supposed to be known for their steaks. As such, I should not have had to send back my steak because it was not cooked to the temperature I preferred. I asked for medium, but it came very pink and bloody. It came back a few minutes later slightly better and yet still bloody and definitely not medium. Come on! Really? On top of which, I found the steak and the sauce they poured over the meat to be flavorless.  My lovely wife ordered crab legs and was promptly told they did not have enough for a full order. She opted for a plate which combined a lobster tail and two crab legs-all of which were well overcooked, dry, and we found out later was priced at $105. That was a hefty price for food that is usually prepared better at much less pricier chain restaurants.  Just before our steak, lobster, and crab legs came, we were given a complimentary pasta which my wife sadly described as nothing better than a can of Spaghetti O's. This place, I thought is an Italian Steakhouse.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place.",

The three of us all had steaks medium rare-porterhouse,ribeye & t bone.We were asked to cut our steaks in the middle to check doneness and they were perfect!!  We ordered the meatball and sausage to go with the meal both great. My wife ordered the baked potato and had to be over a pound. She cut it in half and couldn't finish even half.

    "text": "First time here on NYE and we were very impressed. We were treated like special guests by the staff, especially our server Hugo. He gave us the perfect amount of attention during our visit. Now to the food - we ordered the filet mignon, lobster, white truffle mashed potatoes and bacon Brussel sprouts. Before that arrived, we were served a selection of yummy bread with eggplant/olive spread that was excellent. The chef also sent complimentary pasta since our meal did not include pasta - Hugo said their chef likes to make sure everyone gets a little pasta with their meal. It was delicious, and a nice surprise. The filets were excellent, lean and seasoned nicely. The lobster was heavenly. One of the best I've ever had. The sides were the only slight disappointment. They were sort of plain, not up to the level of the rest of the meal. Didn't see or taste any bacon in the Brussel sprouts. The potatoes were not impressive either. But overall we loved it here and will be back. Manager checked on us and again, our server Hugo was outstanding.",

    "text": "Take the East's love of hearty Americanized Italian, merge it with the Midwest's love of even heartier portions of meat and potatoes and you have Detroit's Joe Vicari's.  Get ready to mix it up and eat!  Located in the D in DTLV, it delivers a Strip like experience at off Strip prices.  Straight to it, starters.  The giant meatball is very good.  Huge, flavorful, juicy, topped with a tart ricotta and swimming in a acidic tomato sauce.  The carpaccio (everyday shaved beef topped with arugula, an excess of Parmesan and tangy mustard vinaigrette), OK.  The calamari, crisp on the outside, tender on the inside also just OK.  Next up, salads.  The caprese is as fresh and vibrant as any but it's a non Italian salad that steels the show. The table side Caesar is excellent.  Coddled egg, anchovies, freshly grated Parmesan; a classic.  It's not Italian without pasta. All freshly made in house.  The Pappardelle with veal ragu is excellent.  Flavorful and tasting like hours of low simmering created it.    The main event, meat.  Standard steakhouse cuts.  Decently trimmed, with a mild 30 day dry aged flavor. A tomahawk and porterhouse were well seared, slightly over temp, tender, with only the lightest bleu cheese, nutty flavor.  OK naked but when paired with Detroit's famed Zip Sauce (a concoction of butter, mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, rosemary, and cayenne), the flavors of the steak explode.  Standard steakhouse sides.  Good, simply grilled asparagus or roasted potatoes.    OK wine list.  Focus on Italy.  Prices are fair.  Good service but lacking the energy you would expect from an Italian eatery.  A welcome addition to town.",

    "text": "The advertising claims that this place was voted best restaurant in Vegas.  Maybe it is the best, except for three things - location, location, and location.  If you happen to be staying downtown, you really can't do any better.  But if you're a local like me, driving downtown and parking at the D Hotel is not the first thing you think of if you're going out to dinner.  Once you get in the doors, though, food, service, and ambiance are all excellent.  I started with the Arancini - a creative idea that was well executed.  Next, I had the lobster bisque, which was one of the better lobster bisques I have had in Vegas.  And then, the bone-in rib eye which was tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  The house signature steak sauce was a perfect accompaniment.  I probably should have had the roasted or baked potato - the whipped potatoes with truffles had a bit too much truffle for my taste.  But that's a small gripe and my own fault.  My wife had the shrimp cocktail, the Caprese salad, and a lobster-pasta special, and she described everything as being \"just wonderful.\"  The staff was not only knowledgeable and helpful, but also very friendly and chatty.  Our server, Louis, was the very model of what high-end service ought to be.  The room was also very comfortable in an \"old Vegas\" kind of style, and would have been moderately quiet (considering that the place was full to the gills), except for the noise of the casino coming through the doors.  Man, that is one noisy casino.  The price was mid-range for a high end steak house - not cheap, but not breaking the bank either.",

We were starving and we came ready to throw back some cash on a fantastic meal - - we were not disappointed!  First, our waiter Miguel was phenomenal.  Professional, funny and well very knowledgeable about the menu.    We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share - the infamous big giant meatball, the calamari, and some shrimp cocktail.  The meatball was amazing. Often times large meatballs are dry inside, but this one was perfect.  The shrimp cocktail were super fresh and tasty.  The calamari was excellent as well.  We then ordered the Caesar salad.  The dressing and salad is prepared by the waiter fresh for you at the table and it is freakin' amazing.  Best Caesar salad I have ever had.     On to the entrees.  My husband and I each got a large Ribeye on the bone.  Mine, however, was a \"special\" that night and it had a flavorful mushroom sauce and awesome gnocchi.  I was concerned that the sauce would be too salty or overpowering, but it wasn't, it was perfect.  The steak melted in your mouth.  Hands down, everyone at the table tried my steak and said it was the best they had ever eaten.  (And we've eaten at many of the best steakhouses in NYC and Boston).  I also tried the lobster risotto and the filet mignon, which were ordered by my friends (all tasty).  Finally, for dessert, we had a slice of coconut cake  - - it was plenty large enough for the four of us to share after eating a huge meal.    We will definitely be going back to Andiamo next time we are in Vegas!  Amazing meal.  Best. Steak. Ever.  You should eat here - Ask for Miguel.",

I don't go there for steak, so maybe that's why I have rated it much higher then my predecessors. The service, ambience was definitely enjoyable. Our chosen dishes were excellent with exception of the Cassata Cake which didn't taste like real Sicilian Cassata.

Old style Vegas at its best.       We were seated in a round leather booth table and Todd was our waiter. He was awesome, we had martinis that were perfect, we ordered the tomahawk steak along with spinach, it was cooked to order and served tableside. It melted in our mouths. The dessert was a cheesecake with liquor masserated berries. Yummy doesn't describe it. I would go back for the steak and Todd again anytime.      If you want delicious food. Wonderful atmosphere and the. Eggs from an era gone by. This is the place. Not old stuffy. Cool vintage and the casino downstairs has dealers and go go dancers. Just wow!!!!",

It is well worth the $$ and Hugo was a delightful server. Will return for another great meal when we are back in Las Vegas. Try it if you can.",

The service was absolutely top notch. The prices were not bad, but for Vegas standards they were great! Nice wine selection that was not marked up too much (by restaurant standards). I had the veal osso buco, and would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. My wife ordered the pappardelle with veal ragu, and said it was one of the best pasta dishes she had ever had in her life. My brother said his steak was done perfectly to his desire and had a great great flavor. Boiled down: if you're looking for steak or pasta, I would highly recommend eating here.",

I've developed a fondness for The D and they treat me really well in order to keep me coming back... if you know what I mean.   Anyway, during my last trip my mom, aunt and I came here to use some of our comps and were blown away!! We generally always did a buffet or diner and hadn't come here since it was open, but we actually went two nights in a row!  We actually made our meal out of salads and appetizers and couldn't have been happier. YUM YUM YUM!!!  Wedge salad, beet salad, lobster penne, sirloin tips, portobella mushrooms, huge meatball... all of it so delicious!!  Highly recommend if you are looking for a nice place downtown. We have talked about the wedge salad multple times since visiting and can't wait until we head back again next month.",

Delicious, delicious, delicious! The bread and sauce they out while you wait was super tasty. But obviously I didn't come to a steak house for bread. My fiance and I both ordered the filet, I like mine medium and she likes hers rare, and we were both extremely satisfied. EXTREMELY. The crust on the steak was amazing and the ZIP sauce is a fat kid's dream come True. Book a reservation if you can, but if you can't, I'd say the wait is worth it.",

Our group of four ate a great meal for around $320 including tip and a bottle of wine.  I would say this is an adult place, no little kids or you ruin the dinning for the rest of the customers, very classy and romantic experience that would be spoiled by the antics of small children, I know I raised three kids.  The food would be wasted on them anyway.",

I've got to say that Vicari's is the best restaurant on Fremont Street.  The ambiance really stands out here.  Try to get a booth if you can.  The booths are very high and are in a semicircle, so it almost seems like you're dining all by yourself.  Really nice.  The steaks are very good, but the pasta really stands out.  The agnolotti and tortellaci were my favorites.  The osso buco was merely average, I'm sorry to say.  The service is impeccable.  Both John and Miguel were just fabulous.  And try the Andiamo Grande Meatball...it's worth it!",

Had a very nice dirty martini as we reviewed the menu. Our waiter (Wayne?) was dressed in a white tuxedo jacket and expertly whipped up our Caesar salad table side. It was very good and kind of fancy since it was served with the romaine leaves left whole. I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly. Hubby had a scallop dish that he enjoyed very much. We had coffee afterwards that was very good; rich and velvety. Idontknow why it's hard to find good coffee in Vegas. Anyway, would have given this place 5stars if it wasn't for Tom Colicchio's Craft Steak which is hard to top in my opinion. Hope you go and enjoy It though, it was good and we will be going back!",

The restaurant itself have a very nice atmosphere. We were sat in a tall, private, circular booth that would be ideal for a romantic date night. Our server was very attentive and helped assist in pairing a nice glass of red wine to our steak.   For our appetizer, we had the beet salad (very sweet with yellow and red beets accompanied with a mayo drizzle) and the lobster risotto (not a fan- was bland and missing wine!). Our steak was cooked perfectly to order and seasoned nicely. Our server wheeled out the a tall tier of dessert after our main course and we were able to pick and choose instead of looking at a menu.  Dessert was a light, flavorful, and decadent coconut cake with coconut shreds, whipped cream and whatever else I can't remember... It was heavenly and my favorite part of dinner.  Overall this is a decent steakhouse(my favorite steakhouse will always be CUT) and very reasonably priced for the service that you receive Our total bill came out to about $140 before tip for 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetizer, steak main course and dessert.",

This restaurant is in an assuming location within the hotel and has a vintage Las Vegas ambiance, similar to that of a speakeasy. The server was very attentive and two managers asked about our meal. I had a stiff gin and tonic and we started with a wedge salad with Roquefort cheese dressing. I had the Osso Bucco which was the largest lamb shank I had ever seen. It was fork tender and served with handmade fettucini pasta and gremolata sauce. My wife had pork and beef agnolotti with a creamy tomato sauce. We were so satiated that we ordered a chocolate and hazelnut cake with praline to go. I highly recommend this restaurant and will return for part 2 on my next visit to Vegas. Normally what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas but this is one memory I wanted to share with everyone.",
