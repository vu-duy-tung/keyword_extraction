    "text": "We went to Morimoto's in Las Vegas for NYE 2018. We thought what better way to bring in the New Year than with some good food so we splurged. Definitely not worth the price. We started with the spicy tuna roll and it was fresh but nothing special. We have had better in San Diego. The tuna tartar was special and different. We than had the pork belly and it was full of flavor, by far the best item we had. For our Entrees I got the Seafood Toban Yaki, the broth was tasty. Except for the scallops, the rest of the seafood was over done. My husband had the braised Black Cod. He enjoyed it, it's hard to overcook Black Cod. In my opinion though the sauce was reduced way too much which made it overpowering. We also got 4 oz. of the Japanese A-5 Waygu. It did not come with the sweet onion and garlic jus and was way over cooked. We have had many better steaks. To pay $140 it should have been one of the best pieces of meat we ever ate. Never again, and a wast of money. Not even the experience was worth it. Even that was mediocre. Very Disappointed and would never recommend it or go ever again. Two thumbs down.",

    "text": "Oh. My. Gosh.  My boyfriend and I were spending a good amount of time after lunch deciding where we would go for dinner (got to make dinner reservations!).  After shuffling through endless options on Yelp and OpenTable, reaching the point of \"Let's just pick whatever and move on!\", Morimoto appeared in my search and the decision was quickly made.  Fast forward to dinner.  My partner and I were so impressed with the ambiance and were also overwhelmed by the fish and meat on display.  We were not ready for this.  I think our server, Jeff, could tell and let us know that he could explain whatever we wanted or needed to know, including the sake list.  Hearing \"sake\", my boyfriend immediately switched menus and scoured the listings.  After some inquiries and having extensive sake knowledge dropped upon us, we (he) settled on one of the bottles that paired really well with our dining experience.  Speaking of Jeff, we were truly appreciative of his knowledge of the food and sake and also the fact that he made us feel comfortable and at ease with such a high end experience.  This was definitely something new for me and my boyfriend, but Jeff made it approachable but extraordinary.  There was a lot on the menu that I wanted to explore, but I was really craving some sushi.  Having had mediocre sushi two weeks prior, this seemed like the ideal opportunity.  We settled on the wagyu beef carpaccio to share, the $50 chef's choice sushi for me, and the $55 chef's choice sashimi for my partner (I mention the prices because there are different price levels for the chef's choice which are based on how many pieces are given).  We did not have to wait too long (good thing because they were making sure our sake glasses were never empty) before our carpaccio came out.  WOW.  Just WOW.  Get this dish.  So tender.  Much impact.  It was a perfect way to whet our appetites.  Then came the sushi & sashimi trays, beautifully organized and displayed.  Our trays did come with different fish, my sushi tray including unagi (eel) and toro (fatty tuna), whereas my partner's sashimi platter had tako (octopus).  Jeff made sure to identify each piece that we would be enjoying before leaving us to dine.  I'm not normally a fan of tuna. However, Morimoto's tuna (even the non fatty piece) was so flavorful and perfectly tender to the bite.  Thankfully my boyfriend's sashimi plate had extra tuna pieces, so I traded some halves of my sushi for his sashimi haha.  Although I mention the tuna, I will say that every single piece was exquisite and on par with my dining experience in Tokyo at the famous Tsukiji fish market.  I was honestly good at this point, but my boyfriend did not want to tap out and ended up ordering an additional Eel & Avocado roll.  As we enjoyed this roll, he was insistent on trying the A-5 Wagyu.  Fearing my credit card balance, I pushed for the Wagyu nigiri.  Jeff, being the amazing server he was, swooped right in and confirmed that the nigiri would be the same A-5 Wagyu and that he personally recommended it over getting the 3 oz. piece at this point in the meal.  Whew.  Saved my wallet while still allowing us to enjoy an absolutely tender and melt-in-your-mouth piece of the Wagyu beef.  We ended the meal with Jeff's recommendation of the cheesecake souffle with blood orange sorbet (I hope that's the dish, if not then please correct me).  With an order of tea alongside it, it was the perfect way to end the meal.  The dessert was mildly sweet and felt light, which was exactly what we needed to end this beautiful experience.  I applaud the staff here for working so hard to ensure a wonderful dining experience for their guests.  Jeff, if you're reading this, contact me so that we can take you to the various places you mentioned in Southern California!",

We shared a bottle of (not expensive) wine and spent between $45-55 each.  Ask suggestions on what to order to the waiters, they are all very friendly!",

I had his cuisine in New York City back in 2015, so I was definitely looking forward to our dinner.   The ambiance is very romantic and clean. The service was great - everyone knows the menu well and makes excellent recommendations. The location is great; it's in the district right next to other celebrity chef restaurants.   The food was just as great as I remembered it. Fresh tasting sashimi and lots of beautiful and unique flavors.  I heard the tuna belly tartare appetizer was a specialty I shouldn't miss and I am so glad I finally tried it. It was out of this world!  The desert had a gorgeous fiery presentation. The waiter took the liberty of splitting our checks without asking him just in case which was thoughtful.   Overall, I'd say that I don't like returning to the same restaurants because I like trying new things, but Morimoto is a restaurant I will find myself at over and over again for years to come! Better than Nobu! Love, love, love!!",

I ordered the chef's choice of sashimi which I chose the option that had 20 pieces. The presentation was amazing and the quality of the fish was outstanding. It was some of the freshest fish I have ever ate. It was a nice selection of fish including salmon, tuna, octopus, and even some Aji.

The pricing for sushi is astronomical. What cost us $200 would have cost me $70 at my local sushi restaurant. I understand I'm in Vegas and I expect to pay a premium but even the menu was a little misleading. The majority (90%) of sushi joints price their sushi/sashimi for every 2 pieces. This place prices theirs by the single piece and that was not explained to us until I was in the middle of ordering everything for the entire table. I suggest to eat sushi somewhere else instead of this total money grab.",

My hubs isn't into wine but I always have a few questions & love to get a hold of these wine devotees. We were seated at the sushi bar & got to watch the these savants at work. I love to sit at the sushi bar most Japanese places. It's faster & I like to watch them prep the rolls. My only gripe is that in most American sushi bars the chefs tend to talk to you as if they were part of your party. Not the case here thankfully. All the perks of the sushi bar minus the third wheel. I'd suggest a reservation to get in however it was 2 days before Christmas so it wasn't exactly jumping anywhere in Vegas so we actually got in reservation free on a Saturday night.

    "text": "(Note:  this is a revised review from December 2016.  Apparently my original review contained a word or two that offended.)  An always bustling MGM Grand Hotel in Fabulous Las Vegas is even more bustling when the National Rodeo is in town. A fine gathering of good people cheering on a mostly teenage group of professional riders of bulls and broncos, steer wrestlers, and calf ropers. And when the fun is done, it should come as no surprise that this audience craves cold beer. House shots. And raw fish?  The famous and beloved Morimoto has brought his act to the strip. Not sure how often he -- or his other celeb friends -- actually get into town. But Morimoto - you need to make a house call to this place. Set aside those photo ops with Snoop Dog that adorn your home page.   My wife and I with our two friends were seated promptly. Our server appeared at once and immediately ordered us edamame and shishitos. A touch pushy, but a good idea. Then she presented ONE menu for 4 people, and proceeded with a \"hard sell\" of the $100 (to $200) per person tasting menu.  Personally, I despise the whole notion of tasting menus. But moreover, it's a restaurant - can we please have some more menus so we can see and chat about what you're serving!?  To our surprise the whole table DID NOT have to participate for the tasting, which liberated our dinner companions to go for the gusto with what the chef thinks is good tonight.   But this \"tasting\" comes with risks. There are no choices. There aren't even hints as to what's to come when you go down that rabbit hole, Alice. You are \"all in\" as they are inclined to say in this town.  With drinks already ordered, only my wife and I had something left to say.  Apps - Miso soup and Morimoto's sashimi with 5 sauces.  Mains - Japanese Waygu steak and \"Duck Duck Goose\" - advertised as duck meatball soup and duck confit fried rice.  Let the games begin.    Tasty Edamame and shishitos that were amply salted made for a delicious start. As did the smoky sauced octopus carpaccio \"for the table\" the runner said (but was later ID'd as the first course of the 2-person tasting menu). Where is our server to explain what was happening?  This was followed by my wife's \"app\" of Miso soup. But it was in fact a family style caldron with a ladle, presented with two bowls and two spoons and inexplicably offered only to the two ladies at the table. But we all tried it anyway. It was just okay. I've been equally pleased with my homemade versions featuring instant dashi, but I digress.   Next up: My app of Morimoto's sashimi. Four Napoleon like layered squares of raw stuff, served with 5 squeezers of sauces that were woefully unimpressive and watery. But, even if they all were good, with only four pieces of chopstick protein, how the hell do you divvy up 5 sauces?  Where oh where is our server?!  Raw oysters with seared foie and uni arrived as a very obvious tasting menu choice. Very tasty - but what can you help but say when you slap foie and uni on anything?  A routine sushi sampler of tuna, hamachi, egg custard, mackerel, salmon, and shrimp arrived shortly thereafter as part of the tasting menu and completely under-whelmed our dinner companions. To quote my friend, \"It wasn't anything more than what you can get at Sushi A-Go-Go.\"   \"Duck Duck Goose\" arrives a la carte for me. A demitasse of duck broth with a tiny meatball, a plate with some sliced breast on gooseberry compote, a drumstick of duck confit, and duck confit fried rice. Mostly unexpected based on the menu description. Mostly bland.   An update:  Our server has still not been spotted.  Waygu arrives cooked properly and legit Japanese. For the money, however, go to Prime or the Wynn if you want that Waygu experience.   Next unexplained item up:  \"surf and turf\" (filet mignon and raw hamachi) and Sashimi sampler arrive simultaneously. My friend, who wasn't responding to the tranquilizer I was slipping him, finally (and angrily) spotted and summoned our server to demand an explanation of what was what.   She shamelessly declared the aforementioned Napoleon like layered sashimi was part of the tasting menu. In front of us now was MY a la carte sashimi app (completely ignoring the missing 5 sauces and the fact that my entree was already finished). She confirmed that the surf and turf was indeed part of the tasting menu. And once our friends secured knives since chopsticks don't slice steak, they confirmed it was good.   But back to this honking plate of sashimi that was declared my app. Severely oversized slices of hamachi, salmon, fish skin, and mackerel overshadowed the thinly sliced pristine red tuna. The mackerel, in fact, reminded one of what is in a chum bucket on a shark fishing trip. And to repeat proteins on the earlier sushi sampler was lazy (if you are keeping score, hamachi has appeared three times on three tasting plates).  Sorry Morimoto. These judges have spoken. And the winner was not your Las Vegas restaurant on this night.",

The kakuni bop might have been disappointing in the sense that the bowl was too oily so the rice doesn't get crusty when it is really hot. Other than that, I'd definitely go back.",

Our waitress was wonderful, the service was outstanding. Was too full to have dessert but did have espresso.

Here, the servers are not very knowledgeable about the menu. Let your servers taste the menu, Iron Chef.  The fish was fresh but the sushi rice was poorly prepared.  It tasted like rice straight out of a rice cooker with no additional preparations.  To be honest, Nobu has much better sushi.    In addition, the fried rice was nothing to write home about.  It seems like all the trendy restaurants are serving up their own version of fried rice.  Well, let me pose a question:  have any of these chefs or sous chefs ever tasted fried rice? Yuck,  Iron Chef.  The standouts on the menu are black cod, tuna pizza, Japanese Uni and flaming chocolate globe.  The sake flights were pretty nice too.  I would return only for the sake and tuna pizza in the bar.  Otherwise, I might as well go to Nobu for their overpriced but far superior sushi and sashimi experience.",

Actual food quality was 4 stars, but minus 2 stars for being CRAZY over-priced for the quality ($85-$90 per person without alcohol).  I felt pretty ripped off spending such money for food that is barely better than mall pan-asian food.  Their snow crab legs tasted less than fresh (slightly fishy taste and lacking the sweetness of truly fresh shellfish) and it also had an odd sauce that reminded me of some amateur combo of ketchup-and-mayo-and-sriraca.  The Laksa Noodle \"soup\" had, instead of broth, a strange paste-like liquid base that was gloopy and unpleasant.  Their version of wasabi friend shrimp was no better than my local restaurant that sells it for half their price.  Admittedly, those were the low-points -- much of the food was decent enough -- but I felt ripped off after paying over $400 bucks for my family of five.",

We ordered $40 worth of food to-go, took it up to our room & dug in immediately. Considering we b-lined from restaurant to room, how'd the sushi taste so... off?  The culprit - the 'spicy sauce' used for spicy rolls. It's a taste I've never experienced before, neither at a sushi restaurant nor otherwise. It gives the sushi a truly rotten flavor, which is such a shame because the actual fish seemed quite nice.  The spicy rolls were so terrible, that we tossed 8 of the 12 pieces we ordered (bye-bye $25!)  Perhaps we ordered wrong. Either way, I'm not rushing back to Morimoto.",

Good combo of dark chocolate, marshmallow and ice cream.  Very good service and will definitely recommend coming back. Would have given 5 stars if the ribs blew me away.",

    "text": "Duck duck goose is really good. Ordered this dish because I like the sound of it! Duck leg is so flavorful and not dry at all, one of the best I've ever had for a long time. Duck meatball soup is tasty but perhaps has a little too much ginger in it, you'd be chewing ginger a lot if not careful. Gooseberry compote adds some sweet flavor to the whole dish, a great balance over the savory duck fried rice. All in all it's a pleasant meal, cute plating and a good variety of food all in one dish. Worth trying.",

    "text": "Wow!!! That's all I can simply say about this epic dining experience that I had a few days ago here. First of all, the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and vibrant. The sushi bar mural is stunning and the row of Japanese sushi chefs in the front just adds to the charm. My dad and I had the Omakase. I don't like raw beef, so they substituted the first course for a white fish carpaccio with truffle. The sauce was absolutely divine! The nigiri course melted in my mouth with fish so fresh! My mom ate the seafood toban yaki which was plentiful and delish! The best part was the service and especially the hospitality of GM Jeffrey Bresslin. He was very attentive to my family and even walked us from the restaurant to get a Lyft so we could get to Park MGM to make our Janet Jackson concert. It was such unexpected VIP treatment that I was so impressed! At the end of our meal, Jeffrey gave me and family a beautiful gift of personally autographed Morimoto menus and a photo of him. We will be back next we time we are in Vegas!!",

    "text": "I've never been to a Morimoto restaurant but I spent my entire childhood religiously watching Iron Chef, if that counts as any kind of familiarity with his food. In all honesty, I didn't know what to expect because my experience with Vegas food / fine-dining is pretty limited. However, Morimoto totally exceeded my expectations & I had a super-lovely dinner before running off to a boxing match, which was conveniently close-by.  The atmosphere is nice, nothing too frou-frou, but definitely ostentatious in that way all Vegas restaurants tend to be without stepping the line into absolutely tacky. Our servers were excellent, in particular their sake sommelier who was very informative & enthusiastic; I always appreciate it when the somm knows their stuff but even moreso when you can tell just how much they love the selections and how thoughtfully they prepared them. As each course was paired and patiently explained to us, we were very impressed with the nuance and consideration that had obviously gone into the selections. The food & drinks come with a heftier price tag, but nothing too exorbitant, in my opinion.  We ordered the omakase, which I think was an excellent choice. It's absolutely worth getting coursed dinners in my opinion & I tend to prefer them more than ordering a la carte when given the option. Less choice and you get a better sense of how the chef considers & curates their menu, you know? The omakase experience was great, starting off with the toro tartare which not only had a fun presentation but tasted delicious; other stand-outs included a seafood stew; a very luxurious beef carpaccio stuffed with caviar and gold leaf; the high-quality sushi; and the salty caramel dessert. I was less impressed with the lobster tail & steak, a riff on surf-and-turf which tasted great but just didn't strike me as particularly imaginative -- a sign I'm clearly struggling to be nitpicky since the food was overwhelmingly excellent. Some of these menu items don't seem to be on the regular menu, which is even more reason to opt for the omakase experience -- in my opinion!  I can't overstate how much I loved my experience at Morimoto. It's fun and unpretentious, a celebrity chef restaurant without resorting to gaudiness and one that does food & drinks well.  Must-gets: if you're not going for the omakase with a sake pairing -- toro tartare, fiery salty caramel chocolate tarte",

I actually ended up not being able to finish my Entree because the appetizer portions were bigger than expected. A bit pricey but to be expected considering the name a Morimoto and that it's in Vegas. Between my wife and I we got the Caesar salad, octopus carpaccio, Laksa soup, Black Cod, and Seared snapper. All were delicious and plating was very pretty. Only minor area for improvement is with regards to the Black bass. While the fish itself was cooked perfect and delicious, there is literally nothing else on the plate so it lacks other textures and flavors to go with the fish. If we come back again I look forward to trying the sushi next time.",

Is it just me or do the hostesses wear Chinese outfits? Isn't this a Japanese restaurant?   My friend specifically came because she was craving uni, but they didn't have any Japanese uni on the day we went. We were then informed that the menu listed the local uni incorrectly at $11 when really it's $15.... per piece. That's kind of crazy expensive. Well, kind of everything on the menu is expensive. I think that's why the morimoto in Hawaii closed.... anyway....  I ordered a negihmachi maki and a salmon skin maki. Both were $9 and nothing too exciting.   I don't think I'd come back here. The service and food weren't anything special and it just kind of had a weird vibe because it began with the waiter telling us the menu was printed incorrectly.",

Using \"brushes\" choose to apply wasabi, sour cream, caviar, nori paste, chives, guacamole and bubu arare to it and enjoy.  Fresh and fun.  Oyster foie gras is an incredibly delicious, rich bite.  Barely cooked through oysters, melting foie, creamy uni all bathed in a teriyaki sauce thinned by the oyster's natural jus.  Served in shell, one delicious mouth full.  The 10 hour braised kakuni rivals that served in the best Izakayas of Japan.  Meltingly soft, soy flavors throughout, fat well rendered.  Sits atop a bed of creamy rice porridge that is totally unnecessary.  Teppanyaki:  Reservations made...  Service is surprisingly good considering the newness.  Friendly, efficient, but lacking slightly in confidence.  Very good selection of Japanese whisky, sake, shochu.  Typical Vegas resort pricing.  Excellent addition to the MGM offerings.",

The funnest thing is, they didn't remake it after we told them.  They simple bake it for another 10 minutes and now it's over cooked.  Actually the baked yellowtail collar smelled pretty bad.  Bit sour.  I honestly think the fish was not very fresh  The general manager caught it and took care of the yellowtail collar.  Great service changed my rating",

Unfortunately I was disappointed by the food for the most part. The fish was not as good as I expected, especially for the cost of it. For the price I expected the highest quality, it definitely was not.   My salad was good, mixed green, but the Caesar salad was terrible. The sea bass was mushy and fishy. All the sushi we had was fishy and dry, it honestly tasted old.   The pork fried rice was good but disappointedly small for the price.   The steaks were good though. We sent our first wagyu rib eye back because it was over cooked. But the chef fixed it and it was buttery delicious.   I would not recommend going back.",

You can save a few bucks too. :) . The other seafood entree was pretty delicious.  A meal for two came to ~$300.  I'm not big on spending big $$$ on a meal but it was worth it. if you are picking a good place to eat in vegas, this is it.  Be sure to make reservation!",

I had to order individual sushi since they don't have omakase. Mizudaiko Uni Anago Oh Toro Hotate and  Mentaiko The mentaiko is sooooo salty that I had to give up.

The sushi was excellent and the kama was good, but the rest were mediocre at best. The laksa was greasy, the rice was dry, and the mizuhiki simply does not present well once they \"unbundle it\". The service was distracted and generally ambivalent towards guests. At one point the manager rushed by our table without a word, grabbed an empty chair, and added it to a table across from us seating a larger party. Not a big deal, but really a careless way to run the front of the house. All in all not worth the money or time considering there are some truly amazing experiences to be had on the strip.",

I can't tell you how disappointed I am at the quality of the sushi. It came with a shrimp tempura roll, a salmon roll and 2 pieces of Yellow Tail, Mackerel, Eel, salmon, shrimp and chu toro. They all came at once! The quality of the fish was subpar. We were told the quality of the fish is different if you are to order individual sushi which in my opinion is bad way to do business. The seaweed on the roll was extremely chewy and so was the shrimp tempura. The rice on the roll was hard as if it was pre made and was sitting on the counter. Honestly I can't remember the last time I had bad sushi like this. You can get better sushi at the strip mall sushi spot.   The Toro tartar was overrated. Nothing special and way overpriced.   Overall we are very disappointed at this restaurant. I had high hopes from a well known TV Chef and all the hyped up reviews. For my fellow sushi lover I hope you read this review and please stay away from this place if you are in mood for sushi. You can use the money to have better quality sushi in a REAL sushi place.   Needless to say we will stay away from this restaurant when we visit Vegas.",

We chose a few cocktails (I selected the Asian pear martini, and hubs got a sake based cocktail, bith of which were beautiful), and ordered.   We ordered all of our choices on sushi rice, rather than simple fish. The fatty tuna was so clean and pure, sliced perfectly. It was tender enough that each piece was a good three bites, allowing me to savor it longer! Next was scallop, my previous favorite. Same idea- a perfect slice, maximizing clean flavor, tenderness, and no need for any seasoning. As a matter of fact, I never used the soy sauce, wasabi, or ginger that came with our meal.  Finally, we ate the uni. I had never has the pleasure. It was epic. Like perfect gelatinous sea. Unable to describe, other than it was one of the most pure and perfect bites I've ever had.   This has ruined me for sushi anywhere else. But it was worth it!",

Morimoto has a man designated for recommending alcohol to come up to your table to recommend drinks - we opted for a sweet ume alcohol. Unfortunately, the one we wanted was out but for a sip, which the man kindly gave us anyways. So we opted for the Ume with Sake - absolutely delicious! Alcohol taste was light.   As for their food, my family went crazy for the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio and Yellowtail Collar. We've had our fair share of Yellowtail Collar at many Japanese restaurants, but this was by far the best - the fish was just so delicate.  However, we did also enjoy all our other dishes such as a King Crab sushi, all their veggie sushi are good for any vegetarians out there. Cold noodle was also perfectly chewy. However, all their other dishes were much loved by my family - I just personally didn't try them.   Service was amazing. They came by to change our plates promptly after eating lobster/crab leg. Water was constantly being refilled. Our waiter, Prince, was very attentive and friendly - since we were a big party, he gave us options of either ordering family style, a la carte, or omakase. Opting for family style, we ordered our food in two rounds so that we got just enough food to eat.",

He chopped it up so small he felt like he was eating a vegetarian dish. There was no protein to chew, so he was really disappointed, being a pork lover. I loved my fish, my only gripe and this is just me, is that I'd prefer the fish not be covered in the sauce. I'm a purist and like the crispness of the fish skin and want to taste the fish, not the sauce.   This place is better than Nobu. We would come back, just not get a bowl.",

Just walking by is breathtaking Yummy food options - large portions Great miso soup- huge portions Gluten Free soy sauce Staff cared about allergies and went out of her way to make sure. Always asked a manager for specifics  We had the miso soup.. crisp delicious flavor, great presentation and HUGE. One protion can be shared. But dont because its so good youll want it all Sushi - spicy tuna, california roll and avacado roll Wow... tasted like butter. Actual richness, flavor and freshness.

We ordered a decent amount of Nigiri, a tomahawk steak to share and a few appetizers as well! The sushi we ordered was  all super fresh and really high quality. We had gone to sushi samba the night before expecting the same sushi quality but definitely did not compare to Morimoto. The steak was good quality, but needed some salt. The appetizers were amazing as well! We got the gyoza, wagyu carpaccio and mixed salad. Great starters before our sushi feast! The sushi was the highlight of the night where the steak was good, but a little bit of a let down. Overall I would say focus on the sushi for sure! It was delicious!!",

Since we wanted to have a real sampling of his artistry we opted for the tasting menu. Each of the six courses was exquisitely prepared. The attention to detail was remarkable, and of course the fish was fresh and perfect.   To add to the fun, Morimoto himself was on site watching over things. He came over to our table and greeted us and then came over to offer the chance for a photo with him. I mentioned to him the he was our favorite Iron Chef and he responded, \"Mine too!\"  We had his family toro, a beef carpacio, his Japanese interpretation of the Italian did bagna cauda, wonderful sushi, a wagu beef and lobster sure and turf, and his famous flaming chocolate ball.  Add a couple of specialty cocktails and some saki and we had a great meal. Not for timid eaters or tightwads, but for a foodie a fabulous experience.",

    "text": "Mediocre to bad food. Chef Morimoto should be embarrassed to have his name on it. Ever eat yellow tail that was as tough as a bad steak? We did. It wasn't even sliced nicely. Every dish lacked flavor and some of the sushi was borderline disgusting. You do not serve a piece of fish with a bloodline running through it. The server suggested a yellowtail rice dish (can not recall name) as a \"favorite\". It was prepared table side. It was blah. The table side presentation consists of a server mixing rice and egg in an extremely hot bowl which cooks the fish as its mixing. More about the presentation (which was not impressive) than about flavors.   As a Local it's embarrassing to suggest \"celebrity chef\" restaurants to our guests only for it to turn out bad. Unfortunately this appears to be yet another Celebrity chef restaurant that doesn't need to produce a good product because it's Vegas. I don't mind high prices for good food but to have a $350 bill for grocery store quality sushi is not ok. To top it off the server was not pleasant but we actually found his attitude funny, we made it tolerable. Restaurant is on the way to the arena. Lacks the feel of a nice restaurant and seems to be an over priced casual restaurant with terrible food. I have a hard time believing that Morimoto would even eat there. I apologized to my guest the following morning for selecting the restaurant. They commented that it was a waste of a meal and probably won't eat sushi for a bit. My guess is it's another celebrity chef restaurant that won't last long. Trust the lower reviews on this place as the good ones seem to be caught up with \"Vegas\" and \"celebrity\".",

    "text": "Masaharu Morimoto is one of the great sushi masters. He's finally arrived in Las Vegas in a very sleek and modern new space in the dining and shopping area of the MGM Grand. I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience.  I had the pleasure of visting Morimoto's original restuarant in Philedelphia last year. I had always watched him on Iron Chef and had heard good things about his growing restaurant empire.   The beverage menu is extensive but I decided on a Thai Basil Smash which is a gin drink with St. Germain, pineapple, basil and a few other ingredients. The menu is broken up into quite a few categories and as our waiter explained, things are served family-style.  We decided to do the sushi combination so that we would be able to try a variety of fish. This ended up being the chef's choice of assorted nigiri which came with 10 pieces of nigiri and a 6-piece tuna roll. All fabulous and incredibly fresh.  For dessert we settled on the panna cotta which was described in painstaking detail when it arrived to us. I remember the words 'bird's nest' being part of it. It was served with some refreshing sorbet on the side.  Definitely an experience to save the time (and money) for at least once when you are in Vegas. I look forward to trying other Morimoto restaurants in places both near and far.",

As a party of 5, we had an opportunity to try a good variety of their signature dishes, along with their omakase ($140.00/pp). If you love omakase, but your dining companions don't, no need to fret. Just come here! Why? Because this is one of the very, very, very rare restaurants that doesn't require that the entire table goes omakase. In fact, only one person in our table, a 13-year old, no less, opted for the omakase.   Some of their signature dishes we tried were:  Hamachi Tacos - Perfect! I could've eaten all 5 of these mini tacos all by myself. Ok, so I'm getting ideas now for my next visit! Lovely chilled hamachi paired perfectly with the crunchy, fresh tortilla, and just the right amount of avocado and jalapeno peppers.   Oysters Foie Gras - super fresh, fleshy, with uni and foie gras. Say yes to the oysters!  Sticky Ribs - served bone-in. This was probably my least favorite, but lauded by the waiter as one of their most popular dishes. Overly sauced, for my personal taste.   Deep fried shrimp served 2 ways - in a wasabi sauce, and  the other was in a light red sauce with a hint of Korean flavoring, but can't recall the official name. It also came with a homemade buttermilk dip. The tempura-like batter held up well, and retained its crunchiness, as this was just lightly coated with their respective sauces. Even as this dish sat a while, uneaten, as we were devouring the other delectables, it's crisp crunchiness held up, amazingly.  Fried Rice with Hamachi - Rice itself was a tad saltier than it needed to be, but the star of this dish was really the fish, which was cooked at the table by searing it against the sides of the searing hot iron pot. Wow! The fish turned out so incredibly moist and flaky. I wish they had this dish with just the fish, sans the rice.  We also ordered a huge sushi combo, which consisted of something like 35 pieces. Slices of fish were exceedingly fresh, fleshy and sliced in generous portion sizes. One disappointment, however, was that we weren't informed that the 35-ish piece count included rolls and tamago (small chunks of scrambled-like eggs). This seemed a little disceiving.  The omakase was very plentiful and artistically presented. Some of the dishes included lobster, tartare, A5 slices (ooh so tender), a seafood bouillabaisse-like dish, and a beautiful 6-piece sushi platter.  Check out my photos. One of the best parts of this pre-set omakase menu, though, was the chocolate bomb dessert it came with. Ooh, a most impressive presentation when they poured a fiery liquid on top of the round chocolate ball, and melted it, causing the chocolate ball to ooze out a liquidy chocolate center. If I could order this dessert separately, I most certainly would!! Plus, it tasted even better than it looked, and it looked pretty darn good! Trust me here!  Speaking of desserts, I'd be up for coming back just for the desserts alone. The doughnuts were perfectly fried, and uniquely presented in a cone, with a round plastic ball filled with pastry cream. You squeeze the plastic cream filled ball to inject the cream into the doughnut. Voila, you've now made your own cream filled doughnut! This was good!  If you're up for going all out for a nice dinner on the Strip, Morimoto's would be high on my list. It's definitely the antithesis of an inexpensive teriyaki bowl dinner at your local quaint Japanese neighborhood spot, but sometimes you just gotta live and enjoy to the fullest. Do that here!",

    "text": "We enjoyed our friends bday at this restaurant. We were not disappointed! The server was super knowledgeable and the food/drinks amazing! I had the havenero margarita drink which was great! We also ordered a recommended bottle of sake which was perfect with our meal. We start first with the fish and the beef carpaccio. The fish carpaccio was delicious and I would definitely recommend for the fish quality and also the center salad. The beef carpaccio was fine but not on par with the price level. We then had the sticky ribs which were amazing as well. The quality of meat and flavorings were both perfect. For entrees, we had the fried fish and the famous pork rice dish.  Both were great but I would say the rice dish was a little underwhelming since it's just practically fried rice.   For dessert we had the chocolate which they lit on fire  and the cheesecake. Both were amazing and we would come back again for it!   Ambience: good decor but lacking for the price level of the restaurant   Service five stars..well trained and fast staff   Food: five stars..all are great although some dishes may not be worth the value   Drinks: great! We had cocktails and sake and not were perfect with it meal",

    "text": "Las Vegas? Ya damn straight it is time for Vegas! It was my buddy's birthday and this is how you do Vegas the right way. My other friend wanted to try the food and experience. I saw the Morimoto restaurant ads in January when I walked through the MGM hotel.  I ordered the Omakase which is a Japanese phrase, \"I will leave it up to you chef.\"  The Omakase at this location in Las Vegas, Nevada has five-course meal with dessert.  We decided to get aged sake called Hakkaisan Snow-Aged Junmai Ginjo, three years, for the table.  The pros are the nigiri is really fresh. Any fresher and the fish will be swimming up to your table. I have been to all you can eat sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and sometimes the the sea urchin has a metallic taste.  The sea urchin at this restaurant has a umami taste but again, it is Morimoto.  The customer service is very on point and they explain how to eat each dish for the Omakase.  We had no problems ordering a table online and surprising the restaurant gets very busy during the night.  The cons are it is really pricey but you are in Las Vegas. You need to go all out. The Omakase is $140 per person and the bottle of sake we ordered is close to $200 a bottle.  I would recommend this restaurant for the experience and if you like sushi.  Here are the images of my dishes, sake, and price tag.",

    "text": "Oh. My. This place was fantastic!! If you're able to pay the prices that they charge, I promise you won't be disappointed!!  We sat at a teppanyaki table so our entrees were ordered off of that. But you're welcome to order from the full menu at those tables as well!  We tried a whole assortment of appetizers. The names are escaping me but one was thinly sliced wagyu beef with a soy marinade and it was probably my favorite! You could easily split between a couple people. We also tried the spicy tuna tacos and they were delish!! True to the name though: spicy   For dinner, I got the SRF Filet Mignon (teppanyaki menu). Oh my goodness it was delicious! You actually get two filets (or at least I did) which was great for the price! So there was plenty of meat thank goodness! The presentation of dinner was also amazing. The food wasn't just thrown on the plate in massive heaps like you see elsewhere!!  Also, full bar was key! They also have great sake options! Love this place!",

    "text": "Morimoto is now one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Vegas! We ate here for dinner last night.   The Vegas location of the iron chef's namesake is located in MGM's The District which is a walkway of shops and restaurants connecting the pool to the main casino.    When my husband booked our reservation over the phone they asked for our eating preferences and our names which they remembered throughout the entire meal.   The hostess sat us at a table next to the front window. I had to laugh because throughout the 2 hours of beautifully plated food with excellent customer service I must have counted at least 15 - 20 inner tubes go by. What's with the inner tubes?! It became a game to see how many we could catch on camera (see collage of photos taken).   In True Japanese fashion we were served hot towels prior to starting our meal.   On MGM's website and there was only 4 dinner entrees listed and none were vegetarian. Thankfully, at the restaurant the menu was massive and with the help of our server, Matthew, I was able to choose between about 15 savory options. He highly recommended the tempura which they could make with only vegetables, the shishito peppers, and an altered version of the Ishi Yaki Chasu Bop which was a rice dish usually served with yellowtail in a sizzling pot. They subbed in Tofu and a runny egg for the fish and called it a Tofu Bop (it's exactly like Korean Bibimbap).   I thought the tempura would be humdrum and like all the other vegetable tempuras I've ever had... but it wasn't!  Easily, the best tempura ever... and being half Asian... I've had a lot of tempura. They fry it at a very high temperature so not only the delicately light batter but also the vegetables get a little crispy. My favorites were the salad leaf and trumpet mushroom, which was a first for me. The tempura was served with a wasabi aioli. Delicious.   The side of Blistered Shishito Peppers with Yuzu Soy tasted very good but also somewhat like others I've had.   The Tofu Bop was presented and mixed table side in a sizzling pot. The only thing different from the Korean version for me was the sauce they pour over the rice which was a Sesame Soy Yuzu and oh so delicious! The rice was crispy from the pot and the flavors were very nice. I would definitely recommend this to future vegetarian eaters.   My husband ordered the tuna tacos, spicy salmon roll and the angry chicken. He liked it all so so much. But being Asian, he ordered a side of sushi rice to go with the Angry Chicken. He said to trust him, it makes it better. Also he said this is not a good first date dish to order... it's hard to look cute while eating chicken on the bone.   We had to order another set of hot towels to get him cleaned up.   For dessert we got the Coconut Mango which was a mango parfait with coconut cake and green tea sorbet sprinkled with \"snow\". It was also plated with cookies that had the consistency of space ice cream and took me back to memories of eating it as a kid. The whole dessert was so delicious and creative and beautiful!!   Overall we were very impressed and will return!! The only change we would make is to ask to sit away from the front window and all the inner tubes. Thank you Iron Chef Morimoto and team!",

    "text": "Summary: Very good, but not amazing. Quality is excellent, flavors are very good, menu is creative and service is attentive. Value is alright, but some of the more popular items will not be very substantial. They also ran out of the popular chocolate dessert and didn't mention it early on despite a 6pm dinner reservation.  My wife and I visited Morimoto for the first time on a Monday evening for a 6pm reservation. We arrived a little early and got a couple seats at the bar to try the cocktails while we waited for our table to be ready. I ordered the Devil's Advocate and my wife got the Asian Pear, but after sipping our beverages we ended up swapping because we liked the other's drink better.  Soon our table was ready, so we closed out at the bar and were escorted over. The server walked us through the menu, highlighted the more popular items and mentioned some of the specials for the evening. Having done some reading on Yelp prior to our visit, we had a good idea what we were going to be ordering. Here is what we got:  Toro tartare - A thin layer of very soft and tender tuna accompanied by a variety of sauces and some crunchy bits for texture. They even provided a tiny spatula to scoop tuna and some sauce, then try the various flavor and texture combinations. The quality was excellent, but the quantity wasn't stellar for the price.  Morimoto sushi - Four pieces of layered fish (of different types) in cubes presented with a handful of little pipette tubes full of various sauces to pour on top and try different flavor combos. This is a nice idea, but with only four pieces of sushi and more pipettes provided a 1-to-1 trial isn't even possible. If you share the dish, you are further encumbered. That said, the sauces were pretty subtle to me, so not much additional impact from their presence. The fish was good, though.  Surf and Turf with Foie Gras - A piece of non-Japanese wagyu beef paired with a hamachi salad. We also added some foie gras to the top of the steak, which added a very nice touch to the very tender cut. This dish was very tasty and well prepared.  Spicy green beans - Classic dish well prepared with properly cooked green beans that weren't too firm or too soft, but were packed with flavor. The spice was good, though certainly nothing too intense.  All in all, the service was great and the food was excellent, but the value element was missing. We were also excited to try the flaming chocolate ball dessert, but they had run out by the time that we had ordered.",

They have 100 combo sushi..all fresh...its 20pcs but worth it, it made in front of you. Our server was Mari who did a complete explanation of the specials and sake. She mentioned about the omakase which my husband ended up getting. It was paired by a nice $80 sake. The Price was worth the dining experience, service was on top , hip nice loud place , the reception was friendly we came on a busy hour 7pm but was accommodated by Saya and was sat by the friendly asian manager who also discussed a bit about the omakase since we asked her about it. We were seated by the bar area.",

    "text": "Being a big Morimoto fan, I watched him on Iron Chef Japan and salivated over his dishes, dreaming of the day when I can have a taste of one of his creations.  We were in Vegas last September and this place wasn't opened yet, so needless to say I was super excited to see a Morimoto in Vegas this time around.  It was added to our list for this year's visit.  There was much anticipation for our last dinner in Vegas before our departure.    Unfortunately we were disappointed with the food.  We started off with an appetizer, I had Laksa soup and my spouse had miso clam soup.  Then the main dishes; my husband had miso glazed black cod with a side of rice and I had roasted pork with Kim chi and a side of butter potatoes.  The black cod was really good and with the rice it was perfect, but I can honestly say it's comparable to Soho, and at Soho it's more economical.    The biggest disappointment was the roasted pork, because pairing it with the Kim chi ruined the flavour of the pork.  Pork was cooked to perfection, tender, moist and juicy.    We walked away feeling meh about the place  unfortunately.",

The only complaint I have is that my waitress seemed to disappear after we got our food and we ended up having to get someone else to help us otherwise it was pretty amazing.  The atmosphere is an interesting one but very much one Id expect for a place like this.   The food was phenomenal with food pairings that I would have never thought about.   We got the seared snappers that was in a curry banana sauce that was to die for. I could have and maybe did lick the plate.  The sashimi was so fresh and the fish just melted in my mouth.  We got a rice bowl that I can't remember what it's called but that was full of flavor with crunchy rice at the bottom like a bimibop.  I'll be back to this place once I win some at the tables. ;)",

I wanted a tasty roll and their selection was pretty simple so I got the spicy salmon roll and it was really good. Nothing special but tasty. Their menu looked awesome. I've had the spicy tuna pizza before and I highly recommend that with the hamachi tacos.   Seems like you need a reso for a table. The manager checked in also. Really impressed.

    "text": "@Chef_Morimoto opened Morimoto Las Vegas at the MGM Grand, we had a fantastic time here recently with my BFF and boyfriend,  love how they keep the place spotless as it was just opened yesterday.   Beautiful layout, high ceiling, a lounge and bar when we first walk in, then a long sushi bar and another dining room in the back perfect for private event. The Beef display case, the see-through glass wine cellar, the 3-D status of chef Morimoto, the nice wooden table, and the gigantic photo arts work behind the sushi bar from floor to ceiling, impressive!    We opted in for the sushi bar where we can watch all the actions.   The food was fantastic. A few dishes you must try:  - Fish carpaccio or anything carpaccio here - Seared Wagyu - King Crab - Tuna Tartare, just the presentation alone , made me salivating  - Morimoto Sashimi, fascinating dish  - That pork belly  - Hamachi rice stone hot pot  - and anything sashimi + sushi, Toro, Uni, and everything was fresh and delightful.  Save time for the desserts, because it's fantastic here.  Don't forget to try their amazing Sake list, a nice break from all the wines tasting we indulge.  Every single dish was on point, delicious, and well timing. Our server was good and attentive.  We got to meet the Mr. Silver Fox GM, what a charmer he is! Thank you for the warm hospitality.   Morimoto is consistent, fresh, delicious and always exceed our expectations. 1 of my favorite Michelin Star places in the Bay Area and Napa Valley, now to Vegas location, quite impressive here too.  You don't find that many sushi/Japanese cuisine that can execute this well, so this is a must visit when you are in Vegas and craving for fresh fish.   It's pricey but it's Las Vegas. If you can't afford it, then don't come here and complain. In life, you get what you pay for.   Enjoy and Viva Las Vegas!",

    "text": "I wanted to start out my review by saying that I consider Yellowtail at the Bellagio to be my Gold Standard for this type of dining genre so I had huge expectations for Miromoto after looking at the menu and some of the stories.  Plus, everyone knows who he is as a famous chef.    My wife and I managed to find 2 seats in the middle of the bar on a Saturday evening around 8pm which was pretty nice since it didn't have a lot of seats to begin with.  John was our bartender and he was both nice and helpful.    My wife was feeling adventurous so she ordered the Pear Martini and I went with a Pinot Grigio.  My wine was good but she felt her drink didn't hit the mark so she switched to champagne.  We had an idea of what we wanted to try after reading the menu beforehand so we were prepared.  We went small plates as we usually do and ordered the Tuna Pizza, Morimoto Sashimi, Grilled Hamachi Kama and the Hamachi Tacos to start.  We then went with the Rock Shrimp Tempura.  Here were the results:  Hamachi Tacos:  I would give them a 5.  Nothing special about them and too much avocado. Tuna Pizza:  Complete fail here.  It was so salty that we had to send it back after 1 1/2 slices. Grilled Hamachi Kama:  Loved this.  It was tender, flavorful and had a crisp to it. Morimoto Sashimi:  This was good, a little hard to eat with chopsticks but had creative sauces. Rock Shrimp Tempura:  The Kochujan Sauce was good.  The Wasabi Aoli was over-sauced.  So the end result was mixed and leaned more towards disappointment since the only thing we loved was the Hamachi Kama. The Morimoto Sashimi was good and half of the Rock Shrimp Tempura we enjoyed.  Maybe the chef was just having an off-night.  One irritating thing happened when we got our bill, we had Edamame on there that wasn't ours and also another menu item which made it appear as if our bill was mixed up with someone else's.  Our bartender did take off the Tuna Pizza since it was so salty.  I just don't see us returning at this time because with all the places in Las Vegas, you expect a higher level of experience here and we felt it missed the mark.",

One of my bucket list items is to dine at an iron chef's restaurant and I'm so happy that I was able to experience it with my boyfriend and some close friends.   Our server was extremely patient and took his time to explain the menu to us and elaborate on specialty items. He suggested we tried the sushi, because the soy sauce and sushi rice were special house made items created by Morimoto. He was right. The soy sauce was so flavorful without being too salty and the rice had an excellent texture to it. The fish was also very fresh. We also indulged in the uni oyster appetizer. This was probably my favorite dish of all HANDS DOWN. I don't typically like uni because it tastes very inky to me, but the uni on this appetizer was so creamy and rich. I think the moment that I bit into this appetizer, I saw ;my life coming together all at once. To my surprise, my boyfriend who hates the taste of oysters, also loved this dish! I think it was a definite game changer for him.   When our meals were brought out, I was certain that they had mixed up our food with masterful art pieces. I kid you not. My lobster dish was too beautiful to dig into. You really do eat with your eyes first and with what I was seeing, I was already in a food coma. My dish was delicious, but my boyfriend's snake river steak was TO DIE FOR. Neither of us has ever tried a high-quality steak, so both of us were completely blown away. The flavor was so delicate and so flavorful all at once and the texture was like slipping into the softest pajamas made of heaven's clouds. If we were to go back (which we definitely will), I'd totally order the steak as my entree without any hesitation.   Last but not least, our table ordered the most flamboyant dessert of all time. It was a chocolate sphere that they douse in rum and set aflame at the table. It was simply beautiful. Inside the sphere was ice cream and on the outside were these little kit-kat like cookies that were so rich and creamy in chocolate. Not only was this dessert a show for your eyes, but it was also definitely a party in my mouth!   TL;DR One of my favorite high-end restaurants to dine at! Beautiful dishes that tasted as amazing as they looked. Order the steak and you will not regret it!",

The highlights: The toro was served on a neat little palette with 6 different seasonings you can try. That was just melting in my mouth.  We had this seafood bisque and it was served over a little fire to keep warm. That soup was delicious. The broth was so flavorful and creamy.  We had six pieces of nigiri. Each fish tasted fresh.  We had this surf and turf with wagyu beef and lobster. I wasn't a big fan of the lobster since I normally don't like that anyways. The wagyu was really good though. It was really tender and rare. Definitely can taste the quality.  For dessert, we had a chocolate ball that was lit on fire to reveal the ice cream inside. It was too rich for me to finish but it was a nice way to end the meal.  Our server was super attentive the whole meal. He explained each course with patience. Super knowledgeable about his stuff!  We also saw Steve Aoki dine here. If it's good enough for him, it's definitely good enough for me! Would love to come here again!",

I can't be one hundred percent sure though because it was Thanksgiving, so you might want to make a reservation to be on the safe side. Our server, Jeff was very kind and was very welcoming. He gave recommendations and tried his very best to help us.   I wasn't so impressed with the food though. We had the sashimi (recommended by Jeff) which was excellent and was as fresh as seafood gets. Next, we had the pork chop which I didn't like. Am thought the pork was fresh, it was too heavy and had a LOT of fat. Finally, we had the black cod which was okay. It was toped with a soy sauce reduction which was too salty. The cod also tasted sweet which really killed it for me. The presentation for all of our dishes were stunning though.  Most importantly, the dessert! We ordered the fiery chocolate tart and the chilled cheesecake souffle. Words can't express how stunning the tart looked! And most importantly, it tasted awesome. The chocolate and marshmellow blended together to make a s'mores like taste. The chilled cheesecake was very light and flavorful. I would recommend that if you do decide to try this restaurant, be careful what you order.",

To my dismay, our server didn't recommend the chef's special because it contained the basics like tuna and salmon and only recommended the octopus carpaccio as an adventurous alternative. Conflicted, I decided to order the chirashi because it contained 10-12 different fish. At this point I wasn't sure what to think about this restaurant because, coming from Seattle, I've had some great sashimi. I'm glad I decided to order the chirashi because I was pleasantly delighted with my dish. The fish were fresh, firm, colorful and full of flavor. The toro had a fat pocket that just popped in my mouth. If I were to order this again I would request that the teriyaki type sauce not be added.  My date ordered surf and turf, which was wagyu and hamachi, and we shared the kama that was also hamachi. The kama was crispy on the outside and extremely delicate inside in texture and in flavor. The wagyu was also delicate in flavor.  While I didn't appreciate my server's recommendations, we did receive a lot of attention from the servers and management. They wanted to ensure we were enjoying our experience.",

The reason for the 5 star yelp review is simple (Incase the viewers reading this are wondering) place is clean service is on point and top notch, and the prices are Reasonable for what you're getting and where you're located that.   The food is great don't get me wrong but We all have different policies and expect something different for me and the menu and I'm not saying it was bad it just wasn't my favorite item in the world,   I'm sure Chef Morimoto wouldn't love everything from my resturant, and I'm sure the fish items are excellent and that's mostly what I have seen people get her, myself, I don't eat anything that comes out if the water.

    "text": "In a word, disappointing. Definitely expected a lot more from the Iron Chef's restaurant.  Visited the restaurant for the dinner.  Let's start with the wine. The wine list is extensive, but most of the wines were quite expensive - for instance, California Cabernet selection had maybe 2 bottles under a $100 from the selection of 25. We managed to find 2012 Bodegas Beronia Rioja Reserva for $60, which was outstanding and may be the best value from the whole list of red wines.   The menu offers a mix of sushi, Asians dishes and a selection of steaks. I asked our waiter's recommendation between the two dishes on the menu (duck meatballs and Ishi Yaki Bop, table-side prepared dish with fish and rice) and got a strong recommendation for the table-side dish.  While table-side preparation sounds very cool, the reality was not so much. So rice, egg yolk, 4 slices of fish and some other ingredients were mixed in a very hot stone dish. The result was, essentially, a fried rice dish, with overcooked fish and very dry rice which continued crisping up while I was eating it. Was the rice flavorful? Yes. Was this $39 dish any better than any standard Chinese restaurant fried rice which cost let's say, $12, for a similar dish which also would be typically twice the size? No. Was the experience was paying for? No.   Additionally, two people in our group had sushi rolls, which looked quite pedestrian - and I understood tasted the same too.  The desserts, however, were a standout. Tiny donut holes in which you pipe the vanilla cream on your own we're melting in the mouth. The pannacotta was sublime, both in texture and the flavor.  Service was outstanding, truly outstanding - definitely on the level you expect from the fine dining establishment.   So here you have the scores: Food: 3- Dessert: 5 Service: 5+  As this is the restaurant where you are expected to spend at least a $100 per person, I can't go with the final score of any higher than 3. No recommendation here. May be the 6 course omakase ($140/pp) or Wagyu steak ($35/ounce) is what you visit this restaurant for, but if this is outside of your budget, this might not be your dining destination of choice.",

We had an amazing dinner there on Christmas Eve 2018...tuna tacos, sticky ribs, braised black cod, duck fried rice, market vegetables, beautiful sashimi, and cheesecake souffle (I usually don't like cheesecake, but this was so light, really lovely). I would happily order every dish again. Jeffrey and Bo helped our table and made a super team. They were so friendly and seemed really happy to be there, even on Christmas Eve...made it a really special experience. We will definitely go back.  Actually I have already gone back with other family on a rush dinner before leaving for the airport and they were again super accommodating and QUICK with their food so as to make sure I would get to the airport on time. We tried to order different things, but couldn't help but repeat the sashimi, sticky ribs and braised black cod!  We'll be back in a few months for my daughter's 21st!",

Morimoto restaurant is totally characteristic of this Iron Chef; he embodies presentation and hospitality, which shows through in every part of the experience.  We were a group of 7 and had reservations for 8pm on a Sunday night. The server was very well informed and knew the menu front to back, giving us her recommendations for small bites, entrees, and sushi rolls.  The chef's sashimi combination platter was unbelievable, with so many fresh cuts of fish. Sticky ribs were a bit on the spicy side, but still enjoyable. Wagyu beef carpaccio had an incredible taste and texture, along with the oyster foie gras! I've never had warm oysters that were still raw before, so that was a fun sensory experience with the different temperatures. The sushi rolls were basic, but done right. I don't think our table had ever had such fresh wasabi, either! Everything was super fresh and impeccable in presentation.  The one thing that made the entire experience so enjoyable, however, was the level of service we received from the minute we were seated. The server discovered my fan-girl status of Morimoto and gifted me with an autographed menu, along with a birthday dessert! It was an incredible dessert, with a chocolate ball that was melted with flaming rum to reveal an awesome ice cream on the inside, paired with a mango-passion fruit sorbet. It was a classic over-the-top Morimoto presentation that sealed the deal for our table.  I would definitely come back to this restaurant in a heart beat the next time we are in Vegas.",

It was pricey but had excellent flavors in a small serving.  For our entree we had the duck fried rice as a side, and the pork chop, which was amazing. The panna cotta was an amazing desert. I will definitely order them again.  The beauty of the presentation was amazing.",

Service and food didn't even feel like it was fine dining. I don't consider it a waste as everything is an experience, but we won't be coming back next time we're in Las Vegas. If you want to try out this place, I would suggest coming for the desserts. They're beautifully presented and definitely unforgettable. As for the main courses you can find better elsewhere.",

    "text": "We were very excited for Morimoto, having booked a trip to see Lady Gaga we were staying on this end of the strip. We dove right in and decided to do the chef's tasting menu.   First of all the restaurant is beautiful and the service was spot on. The tasking menu dishes started in a speedy manner right after we started sipping our first cocktail, a welcome change not waiting to get the meal started. The first dish of 6 courses was an impeccable wagyu beef carpaccio topped with a shaved black truffle. Bright flavors to start what was sure to be an amazing meal. The second dish a ground tuna belly (photo attached) served with accompaniments and a cube of toast was the highlight of the meal for flavor and presentation.  The third course on however took a turn away from 5 stars toward only 4. It was a cheese fondue served with colorful veggies, a shrimp, fish ball and fresh udon noodles. A really clever idea but lacked flavor since you are dipping these items in what really just tasted like pizza topping. Course 4 was a nice flight of Nigiri sushi served with 'Morimoto's blend of soy sauce'. Perfectly executed but unfortunatly my wife is not a fan of uni (sea urchin) or geoduck both of which are acquired tastes so it would have been nice if the server asked if you wanted any substitutes.  The 5th course was the most disappointing after 4 smaller plates a large serving of 'surf and turf' came out. A lobster tail, a poorly seasoned dry filet mignon, and some mushrooms with potatoes. I can't help but think the Morimoto staff are trying too hard to cater to the American ideal plate serving this over-sized dish. Just didn't fit in with a tasting menu to have a huge serving of meat and potatoes at the end. Desert was a very 'un-Japanese' chocolate on top of chocolate creation. Well executed by a skilled pastry chef but after a huge meal would have preferred something light and refreshing with some bright flavors.   Overall for the price of a tasking menu and drinks this was a 3.5 - 4 star meal for me and my wife.",

For dessert, our waiter brought us two scoops of ice cream with happy birthday chocolate and a candle.  He looked at my friend's ID and mine before we ordered drinks in the beginning and said that he saw our birthdays are close to today's date and  wanted to wish us a happy birthday.  How sweet?

    "text": "Came here over the weekend to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend. Had reservations at 9:15pm and the place wasn't too busy for a Sunday night.  We ordered the 100$ set of sushi. This was delicious and I highly recommend. We didn't like the mackerel because it was too fishy for us but that's the case any where we go for sushi. The sushi rice was also delicious but it was pretty filling.   We thought it wasn't going to be enough food so we also ordered the [isha yaki chashu bop] which was brought out in a 450 degree hot stone bowl which was mixed in front of us by our server. My boyfriend says this is the best fried rice he has ever had and I must say it was so good.  We ordered the crispy whole fish as well which was also very good, more than what we expected.   The service was also amazing and we felt taken care of during our time there. I highly recommend Morimoto's and plan on coming back!",

Our server provided excellent customer service, his name is Aries. We took all of his recommendations! We had the rock shrimp, tacos, and the chocolate tart for dessert. Everything was delicious! I really appreciated the service we received, a female with dark hair (I believe her to be the manager) stopped at our table to see how we liked the food and gave us some suggestions on what we can do during our stay since its our first time here. Overall, great food, staff and a perfect start to our vacation!!",

Aside from the food, all of the employees were very attentive and accommodating. At the  completion of our meal, the manager even stopped by our table to ask us how our dining experience was, and we had no complaints.

Everything was delicious, and just the right amount of food for the table.

Our waitress was amazing and had excellent recommendations and answered every question that we had with ease. We started with the Toro Tartare and sushi rolls which were HEAVEN. The presentation alone makes it an incredible experience. My entree was the angry chicken and that was incredible as well. With the chicken I will warn that it was riddled with bones, and a little hard to maneuver when your buzzed on delicious champagne, but so worth it. It was my birthday and  they brought out an adorable serving of wasabi raspberry sorbet which was delicious as well!! Since I can't have dairy I couldn't try all the wonderful looking desserts, but everyone at the tables around us looked like they thoroughly enjoyed theirs. I have been dreaming about this food since we came here, and I'll definitely come back on our next Vegas trip!!",

During that time I was asked my name several times as well as being asked if I had reservations. Several people who arrived after us were seated immediately, makes me wonder. Once we were seated it took 45 minutes to have the appetizer served, half dozen oysters? Later the waitress left the desert menu while my wife was still on her main course, leaving an impression like your taking to long. We originally had planned to go to the Hard Rock but wanted to try this instead and was very sorry that we did, no comparison as to service and quality. I would give them another chance in a few months hopefully they can address their problems.",

Then was quickly placed back in its hiding spot for us to not get a prompt refill yet again. We told the server we wanted to start with appetizers then choose our main, either sushi or one of the plates. We waited another 35 minutes for the menus to be brought back  to us, and at that point were wondering if our last appetizer was coming out. The server said she forgot to order it and asked if we still wanted it. I said yes and she bailed before we could order our main...again we waited then were over spending more money. Everything is incredibly expensive, but we were ok with it. What I am not ok with is watching a few tables get perfect service while we get cast aside and still stuck with a $800 bill.

It's not cheap for just the small slice you get and I didn't want to spend all my food budget while in Vegas on one restaurant. I still had few more places to go and try out. I felt happy that I got to eat some morimoto sushi and felt content. The nigori sake was so delicious. It's the unfiltered sake and has a little bit of a sweet taste. I loved the nigori sake here! It's so smooth and delicious. My dessert was like a chocolate shell that had marshmallow inside. The server poured liquor on it and lit it. It melted a little and a marshmallow oozed and it was fantastic. It wasn't overly sweet but a perfect ending to a nice dinner here. I'm just bummed Otoro was a size of a domino for two slices. It was a tease but so good. I couldn't get myself to spend another $17 for two small slices for more.",

To be honest, it may be because of all the years that have passed or because I traveled to Japan recently and have experienced traditional Japanese cuisine, but my experience at Morimoto this time around wasn't as breathtaking.  Though, the dishes were in general, delicious, and for the $120 omakase style that we paid, I think it was worth the price. But when you get down to the details of each dish, most of them was either slightly sweet, a tad bit oily, and so forth, and I personally think the restaurant is between a 3 and 4 (closer to a 4 though).  We were able to get reservations on the day of (Saturday), which was surprising as I thought they would be pretty full. We had a 5:15pm reservation and less than half the restaurant was full until around 6:30pm, which is when it started to fill up some more. We got around 7 dishes for the omakase, and added on the flaming chocolate dessert. The whole experience was around 2 hrs, and the dishes came out with good timing. There didn't seem to be a dress code, but most people came casual formal, if not dressed up even more - I mean, it's Vegas!",

    "text": "Had some sushi type items, ok and nothing to rave about. Wagyu carpaccio was good. Dessert, mango/coconut was the definite highlight. Service was excellent.  Aside from mediocre overpriced food, what ruined the experience was MGM, walking through the stinking smoky casino trying to find the restaurant buried in MGM's food court.  What really set me off was the fact that after being dropped off at the front MGM door by my Uber, MGM makes you walk 20 minutes into some dark hole of a garage in the back of the building if you want to catch an UBER to leave. My opinion on why they do this is some arrangement (kickback) and to support Vegas cabs who of course hate Uber. So MGM, here is what I say to you, GFY! I will never go to your hotel of food court again when I am in Vegas.   Morimoto, you chose to sign a lease in an MGM property that treats their customers in this manner. Plus your sushi items are wildly overpriced for the quality which is definitely nothing to write home about. Your name is on this place, people expect a far higher quality of food, and frankly I feel ripped off.  So many better *values* available in Vegas eateries, sorry I took a chance on what seemed to be a high review rating, big mistake.",

    "text": "Whats to be said about the infamous Iron Chef that opens a restaurant in Las Vegas?  Welcome to the club!  Set in a former tepanyaki location in the fabulous MGM Grand.  Neighbor to that one chef that slaps a dash of seasoning on a dish and yells BAM!  You wouldn't be surprised to notice that there are still some tepanyaki grills in the back.    Although you could not go wrong with the standard tables.  We opted to be entertained while we eat.  Best part of Morimotos tepanyak grills are, the women at the table are actually respected during this meal, rather than getting confronted with the usual harrasment at other Japanese grill spots in this town.  However hilarious they may be.   The menu is surprisingly standard for semi Japanese fusion.  The sushi chefs all look legit.  There are traditional rolls and sashimi.  There are the obligatory poke \"tacos\" in fried eggroll shells.  There are the tuna tartare \"pizzas\" of course too.  Being completely honest, the first time we came those dishes were the bee's knees.  The second time they were a bit off.    We slapped 2 (48oz?) tomahawk ribeyes on the grills both times we went.  Both times they were the highlights of the dinners.  The steaks come with 3 sauces.  Bernaise, chimichurri and Morimotos steak sauce.  We all know the first 2, but I'm pretty sure some of you have had the sweet and salty asian sauce at Korean bbg before.  Thats what Morimotos steak sauce tasted most similar to.  Getting down to desserts.  They get down on tha flo' wit those.  Deserts are not to be skipped at this spot.  The flaming rum chocolate smore ball plate!  The mango custardy bowl thingy!  The sorbet type whatever it was dish, and lest not forget, the super duper chocolate cakey cheesecake-ish desert were all Raku Sweets rivals in and of themselves.  Diabeetus.  We had our very own Morimoto impersonator with us.  My little brother.  It was fun seeing the servers double take as we were being seated, lol.  My 3 year old cried until he got the foot long bone of the tomahawk to knaw on.  We kept chewing on it until we got to the car.  My toddlers couldn't stop eating steak and the chef prepared some bits and pieces to well-done for them.  Very nice service all around.  It is nice to see a staff that takes pride in their establishment and quality of ingredients well worth the dollar value on the strip.  Sometimes the chef actually comes in to check on the progress too.  All aces.  I know I have given out too many 5 star reviews already, but Morimotos really does deserve it.  If not quite extraordinary in menu innovation, but in service and quality of dishes in general.",

    "text": "My sister took me here for my birthday, special occasion plus we had gift cards so decided to splurge. She's been wanting to try this place since she heard it was happening and finally decided to come in. We RSVP for 5:30, arrived around 5:15 and checked in, they seated us immediately. The place is beautiful!! Very spacious, lots of tables, they are well-staffed!! 3 hostesses at the front, two managers on duty, and many servers and bussers.   The three of us decided to to Omakase. $140/person for 6 signature dishes.   #1 - Toro Tartare - 10/10 - Presentation is on point, very Instagram worthy! The Toro was delicious, sweet and fresh, the sauces on the side were nice, you can mix and match and everything simply tasted amazing. From presentation to taste, very impressed. It is a fun dish to eat, the little scalpel you and scoop the Toro with, a very fun experience.   #2 - Beef carppacio - 10/10 - with some oil, slices of truffle and capers and some greens on top. Tasted pretty good, a little too oily but nothing crazy heavy. I don't think this is on their regular menu, it could be, I don't remember.   #3 - Some kind of fondu style dish - 5/10 - Tomato sauce with cheese in a cute little cup with a candle on the bottom to keep it warm, came with: fish balls, shrimp, salmon chip (fried salmon), mussel, pasta, broccolini and carrots on the side. Neither of us liked this dish! Presentation looked awesome, when first brought it out we were all excited to try but it looked better than it tasted. The tomato sauce and cheese mix were ok, tasted good with the pasta. The fish balls were very strange, they were super cold which required dipping in the sauce for quite a while but then it was still cold on the inside. The shrimp and mussels were whatever. The salmon chip was so stale and hard, did not taste good at all. The main part of this dish is the sauce because everything was supposed to be dipped in it but the sauce was very plain, nothing special.   #4 - Chef's sushi selection - 10/10 - Came with 5 pieces of sashimi and one gigantic square-shaped sushi. This was really good. The sake salmon was so sweet and delicious, the tuna as part fatty tuna which was awesome! Those are the two stand out pieces of the dish. The rest of the fish were fresh and delicious also!  #4 - Surf and Turf - 10/10 - The steaks were so good! More rare than I would prefer but it was not bloody so I was ok with it. The sauce was amazing, steaks were so tender and soft, melts in your mouth. Lobster came with half a tail and a claw, really sweet and fresh, even the root potato was really good.   #5 - Flaming Dessert and Japanese Cheesecake: -Flaming Dessert 5/10 - This comes with omakase, I am a chocolate lover but thought this was too much chocolates. Presentation was cool but the entire plate was chocolate: chocolate cake, chocolate pieces, chocolate crumbles, chocolate everything - easily too sweet and taste over overwhelming. I would have liked a few different flavors to balance out the sweetness.  -My brother is not a fan of chocolate so they were nice enough to replace his dessert with the Japanese cheesecake when we asked. Presentation on point and the cheesecake was sooooo good! Soft and fluffy, melts in your mouth, decadent but not too sweet or heavy, wish I wasn't too full so I could have finished it.   Cons: -Server did not ask how we wanted our steaks cooked nor did she inform us that it would be prepared medium-rare (I usually like my steaks medium well) -Waited a bit for waters to be re-filled once they got busy -We saw that they brought out the next dish and stood there and waited to give us our food because of old dishes were not cleared yet  -Had asked our server if we could replace one of our dessert and I'm pretty sure she forgot to ask the chef, asked her again and she came back quickly with an answer  -Random note but their chopsticks were weird lol - looked fancy but was cheap plastic, did not really go with the rest of the place (doesn't bother me at all though, just thought it was funny)  Overall really enjoyed this experience. The staff were attentive, food was unique and delicious for the most part, really enjoyed the overall vibe of the place.",

For dessert Djuro recommended the chocolate tart the presentation was very neat. They light some type of liquid at your table and pour it over causing the chocolate to melt over marshmallow which was very tasty.

Overall I loved the hot appetizers and entrees and like the sushi and desserts.  For appetizers my wife and I ordered: Oyster foie Gras - the combination of oysters, door gras and uni was amazing. After I had the first piece I was thinking I need to order few more of these. Laksa noodle soup - it's such a comforting dish. The egg was so flavorful, the curry soup was well balanced, wonderful curry flavor with a little kick to it but not too spicy.  Pork belly with congee: the piece of pork was so tender. Entrees: Braised black cod: the piece of fish was so perfectly cooked that my chop sticks just slid into the fish without any effort on my part. The cod was so moist and the ginger-soy reduction was spot on. Seafood pot: this dish was a little spicy but that's what made this dish great, spicy but not overpoweringly hot, the lobster broth made all the seafood in the pot tasted better. We also order few pieces of nigiri, they were good but my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas offer cheaper but better sushi. I won't order them next time. For dessert we ordered the chocolate tarte and souffle they tasted fine and looked beautiful but just not amazing. Good not great. For the next few days after our dinner at morimot; my wife and I kept talking about our experience and planning our next visit. It was that good. One of the must try in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I love Morimoto!!! I tried Morimoto in NY a few years ago and both Vegas and NY locations were amazing. As an avid food network watcher, I grew up watching Morimoto on Iron Chef (even the japanese ones where I couldnt understand anything).   The NY location has better decor esp the downstairs chic looking lounge/bar area and their infinity windows in the bathrooms. But when it comes to the sushi part, I believe the Vegas location has fresher and better sushi than the NY location. T  My party shared a sashimi platter and a sushi platter and both were amazing. The tuna tartar and white fish carpaccio was tasty, flavorful, and good for sharing. Thumbs up to the sushi chefs there.  Oyster foie gras, my favorite Morimoto dish!!!! Its even better than the toro tartare which is Theeee dish here.  Black cod, pretty standard japanese dish.  The fauncy chocolate dessert is worth getting for the Gram. They pour over some fire to melt the chocolate ball and there is something inside, get your cameras out for vids. However, it tasted so-so.  For the price tag, its better than Nobu (excluding the omakase, never had it at either place).",

We were in Vegas and Morimoto's there was celebrating 1 year anniversary to the Iron Chef himself was there and we had wonderful meal with 6 course chef's choice with wine pairing.  Since this was chef's choice I am not sure I can remember all the dishes but I remember that we were overwhelmed by the flavors and his take on some of the more classic dishes.  And to top it all off was his flaming chocolate tart desert.  My recommendation get the Omakase.  I am sure that other menu list dishes are great but let the chef make his choices and do the dishes they feel are best.  But your wallet will feel it through ($140/pp + wine pairing) will take it to about $250/pp but what a hell.  You only live once.",

    "text": "I came here because... it's freaking Morimoto. The famous name speaks for itself. Please note: this place is pricey, but you're paying for the brand. THE NAME.  We sat down for dinner here this past weekend and I am so happy we did. Sue was our server and she was SO friendly. Like scary friendly, in a good way. Just so sweet.   DRINKS: I don't like carbonated water, because what's the point of carbonated water? Seriously, why is carbonated water such a thing?! But, Sue thought I said yes, so she brought it to us. My hubs drank it while the other server brought me regular water. But... we also ordered some sake. Bonsai Bunny sake. Mmmmmm It was sweet but good!  FOOD: Spicy Tuna Tacos: Delicious. The tuna quality was so good. I know people are thinking, Oh I've had tuna tacos, they are all the same. NO. NO. They are not. These tacos were amazing. The tuna was so clean and just melted in my mouth. It was so good. It didn't fall apart too like you'd expect from a regular place. This here isn't a regular place... this is Morimoto!!!  Pork congee: This was the BEST dish ever. The pork was perfectly cooked where it melted in your mouth. The congee was so flavored. I could have this EVERY SINGLE DAY. It was so good.   Yellowtail bibap: A little too salty for my taste. I was kinda depressed at how salty it was. Everything was so perfect and then this was kinda a disappointment. I ate the whole thing because it was still expensive but still... salty.  Pork chop: OMG. This was another amazing meal. Each pork chop is cut perfectly to still be savory. The quality was impeccable. It was so good. The sauce and the extra stuff around it was so good.   Dessert: Japanese cheesecake - so I thought this would be like Uncle Tetsu which is nearby my place, but it wasn't. The cheesecake was like cheesecake but softer and delicious!!! The dessert sides complimented the cheesecake, including the sorbet with graham cracker shredding. Mmmm... It was so good.  AMBIANCE: Very posh. Very Hollywood or Vegas. The decor is nice. It wasn't jaw dropping, but it was still nice. What can you do? It's Vegas. They can't be too foo-foo-y.  BATHROOMS: Only one women's stall. Meh... it smelled like cigarette.  SERVICE: Great service. Sue was great.   OVERALL:  It was great, but avoid the bibap if you don't like salty.",

    "text": "I only decided to try Morimoto because it was conveniently located in MGM where I was staying. I walked there the night before to make a reservation since I had a show to catch right after dinner. If you don't have a reservation they'll likely seat you in the lounge/bar area instead of the dining room. If you want to eat a full meal I think it's better if you sit in the main dining area.   Beef carpaccio- beef was sliced perfectly thin and tasted yummy too.   Lobster and seafood- loved the broth this dish came in. It was really rich in flavor and added a lot to the dish. This was a relatively expensive entree but delicious nonetheless.    Baked oysters with uni- This dish was the most disappointing. I guess I prefer my oysters raw. I just didn't like the taste of this dish.  10 piece sushi nigari + spicy tuna roll- The sushi was better than what I had expected with a good mixture.   I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here but if I stay in MGM again I might give it another go.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.   Morimoto food is just fantastic. Their ability to fix mistakes could use some work but they definitely tried. This review is only under 5 stars because of the back and forth service quality. First, we reserved teppanyaki table for 6 about 2 months out to make sure we had placement. They saved 5 seats for us only, leading us having to wait 15 minutes for them to bring over a bar seat that was 3 inches higher than everyone else with no space on the side of the table. Then, the menu was just very confusing with the a la carte and teppanyaki experience and the waiter didn't do a great job of explaining. Still we got a few free items for our wait which all but makes up for it. But 2+ hour dinner for just an entree seemed excessive.   As stated before, everything I ate was ridiculously tasty. For our wait we received free salted edamame and sticky ribs. The ribs were some of the best I've ever had and just fell off the bone. The edamame was just a nice opener. No spices, just salty. I also ordered an absinthe concoction that was perfectly leveled with alcohol taste but enough fruit flavor that was perfect for a Japanese meal.   For entrees, as a group of 6, we touched just about everything. We had a few rolls, asparagus side, few duck fried rice, and spicy green beans. Of those, the rice was good but more a pilaf than fried, with not enough duck to make it worth $14. The green beans had no spice but simply a Chinese sauce similar to an XO. Asparagus would be my pick for our best side. About 4 large asparagus, sliced into perfect sizes, in some tasty sauce.   For dinner a few had filet, 1 lobster, and 1 chicken cooked on grill in front of us. I had the miso cod. From what I rated, the lobster was fantastic and the standout. Really grilled and sliced in half so you get to enjoy it all. Filets were just a nice steak, worthy of any Japanese steakhouse. Chicken was cooked interestingly in front of you with the smoking style, but not a must. The black cod was fantastic, especially at under $40. Unfortunately it didn't come with sides as most things are a la carte at the restaurant, sans a few veggies or dipping sauces for all. If you like miso sauce, this dish will blow you away. Strong flavor and so much sauce, so make sure you get a side that's suitable for dipping because the sauce is unbelievable.   Considering this is Vegas strip restaurant, especially at the overly-expensive MGM, Morimoto is very affordable. Entrees at about $40-60, sides under $15, and drinks under $20. I would highly recommend Morimoto for any meal - special occasion or just for a nice vacation meal. The teppanyaki is not a show you would expect at chains, so I would recommend reserving a table and just getting a good meal instead.",

Best thing yet if it's not to your taste they won't charge you and they will give you something else like good customer service should be. But if you're wanting to broaden your horizons and have a tasting adventure this is the place!",

    "text": "My previous review of Morimoto was with the No1DP who appreciates Iron Chef Morimoto due to the fusion elements of his cuisine. Turns out that my family went to eat there without me NYE 2017 and enjoyed it so much that everyone wanted to go back there on the next visit. Because I was able to go back my two reviews can focus on two of the core aspects of the restaurant. While my first review focuses on the fusion elements of the restaurant, this review focuses on the social/group dining element of the restaurant as literally almost every dish can serve as a small plates item.  According to our waiter Nicole, Morimoto can be best experienced three different ways: small plates due to their emphasis on hot and cold appetizers, sushi/sashimi due to their separate menu and entrees that focus on the fusion elements, but with an added steak option for a little example of Vegas decadence. We could've done the omakase option for significantly cheaper but we liked having the independence of ordering whatever dishes we wanted. Through the suggestions of our waiter we were able to partake in all the plates fairly.  DRINK: Thai Basil Smash (Hendricks gin, St. germain, pineapple, Thai basil, hibiscus, $17). A sweet cocktail that hides the taste of gin. Could taste the pineapple but not the basil.  TRUE APPETIZERS Cold - Tuna pizza (anchovy aioli, olives, jalapeno, $23) - Yellowtail 'pastrami' (togarashi, gin creme fraiche, candied olive, morimoto grapeseed oil, $24) The emphasis here is the quality of the fish. Instead of ordering sushi/sashimi as a pure fish it's incorporated into the fusion cuisine as an appetizer. The tuna pizza works great because the aioli, normally strong, doesn't overpower the fish. Same thing with the yellowtail and the togarashi/creme fraiche. Only thing bad here was the candied olive, it was too tough.  Hot - Kakuni x2 (10 hour pork belly, rice congee, soy-scallion jus, $21) - Rock shrimp tempura (spicy kochujan sauce, wasabi aioli, $23) These are more filling than the cold appetizers. Pork belly is very savory and filling on its own, hence best separated into small parts. Congee helps the digestion of such a rich meat. Tempura is good but only if your party appreciates wasabi and Korean pepper paste, which are very dominating and spicy parts of any food. Luckily for my parents it is made mild, but I would've appreciated something stronger.  ENTREES AS SHARED PLATES - Whole roasted lobster (garam masala, lemon creme fraiche, $56). Garam masala worked here in addition to the vegetables. Wish that the creme fraiche came earlier as it would complement the garam masala as it's a strong flavor in itself. - Crispy whole fish (spicy tofu sauce, papaya salad, $43). With the help of Nicole she split the fish to make it easier to eat. Luckily there were not a lot of bones and the fish was soft and flaky. Tofu sauce was not spicy. - Japanese A-5 Wagyu ($35/oz, 3oz minimum). What's notable about this dish is that the wagyu can be ordered three ways: as a NY Strip cut, ribeye cut or filet cut. We got the ribeye cut. Like a high-quality otoro, the meat literally dissolves in your mouth as you eat it due to the high marble. I have not experienced this in any other wagyu even in Japan, hence this is my gold standard for wagyu. - Ishi yaki buri bop (yellowtail on rice cooked tableside in hot stone bowl, $38). If you've eaten at plenty of Asian restaurants you'll realize that this is a literal description of the dish - fatty yellowtail (buri) bibim(bap) served ishiyaki/dolsot style. If you've read my reviews I love buri and dolsot bibimbap so right away I fell for this dish. This is also appropriate for a closing dish due to the carb. Fried egg not necessary. - Chinese broccoli ($10). Tough and a bit plain but necessary between strong umami flavors from each of the mains.  DESSERT - Tutti fruiti toro (guava pineapple gelee, tropical fruit sorbets, $16). Identical to their famous appetizer toro tartare with the gelee as counterpart to toro. It is also eaten identically to the appetizer, with the combination of gelee + sorbet much better together than the sum of its parts.  - Chilled cheesecake souffle (blood orange meringue, strawberry-red wine sorbet, $16). The souffle was too small for five people. The citrus meringue worked here with the fluffy cheesecake.  Even by Vegas standards, Morimoto is certainly not a cheap meal. My contribution including tax and tip came to about almost $200/person. Ever since all of my parents' kids started working our choices for fine dining expanded; my family loves the wagyu so much they will pay the money to eat the wagyu here as they can't fly to Japan as often as I do. I will go back here because their execution of fusion cuisine is one of the best I've seen. Japanese fusion with emphasis on quality of ingredients.",

The tuna pizza was unique and OK too. Ribs were good and the Black Forest was really good. Service was attentive and friendly. In hindsight, it was a good meal. Perhaps I should tempered expectations, I was expecting every dish to blow my socks off.",

Not sure why Morimoto has all these high ratings as it was mediocre sushi at best.  We tried, tuna belly...decent; Spanish mackerel...fishy and not good; red snapper...chewy; a spicy yellowtail cut roll...that was the best item.  The prices are high but I don't mind paying for great sushi, this place just blows!  The real foodie Excitement turned to Disappointment",

My son got 10 pieces of sushi that he ate before the waitress even saw him with the dish.    Overall I was so impressed with the atmosphere, service, and of course the food",

    "text": "A classic example of a celebrity chef slapping their name on a restaurant with clearly little to no involvement in the establishment. We expected a higher standard at Morimoto and at best it's an average Japanese restaurant with inflated prices. The Teppanyaki tables were booked for the night which was a blessing in disguise after seeing the look of disappointment on customers faces. There was a man sitting there who was clearly unhappy saying \"100 bucks for this\" and I don't blame him. There was nothing entertaining about it, portions looked small and it seemed to drag on forever as they shaved meat off large bones on the grill which was grossing me out. Looking at the Teppan menu it's all about the Wagyu beef with no option to order chicken, shrimp, vegetarian or seafood. If you are looking for a traditional Teppan grill experience save yourself the cash and disappointment by booking a reservation at Benihana.  Over in dining service was slow, portions were small and I've had better sushi from grocery stores. My husband ordered a surf & turf that was over cooked, didn't taste all that good and left him with food poisoning diarrhea later on that night. For that reason I give Morimoto 1 star. Their bathroom was terrible as well, 1 toilet and so dark you couldn't even see what you were doing. Not what you would expect from a high end restaurant at all. Wish I would of ate at the other sushi place in the MGM, at Morimoto it's all hype and you certainly don't get what you pay for.",

Not only was it ridiculously salty, but the mixed greens in the middle were so smothered with dressing that I could not eat it all. For my entree, I ordered the chirashi. The pieces of fish included nearly all seemed to be the leftover scraps that they couldn't use. Some were a bit mangled and others just didn't look appetizing. Service was great, but the food lacked so much that it made the overall experience a fairly disappointing end to a long work trip.",

    "text": "The trendy, upscale ambience of #Morimoto makes it on my List of Highly Recommended places to take your #Date or Clients to while you're in #Vegas.   The restaurant is cozily tucked inside the #MGM Grand So you can't miss it.   The hostesses were very accommodating and since I had to make reservations for five people, they conveniently seated us at the entrance. Loved it. We were greeted by an enthusiastic server who gave us a little history of the Sake (Borne was peachy sweet, yum) we selected.   Nice touch, very classy, but the only tiny suggestion I have is ask your customer if they want to hear about the  history...Not a reflection on our server, because ii suspect I suffer from ADHD   Another thing  I liked about my experience  is that our server made it a point to ask if anyone had allergies. That's cool!   For me it's cheese, dairy and chocolate.  Loved that part since I'm allergic to a few things that I assume don't exist in sushi restaurants anyway but who knows, right? So that was a nice touch.   If you look at my reviews it's really hard to disappoint me, but one of my Followers said I need to write down my thumbs downs too so here's one.    I felt that sharing my allergies to the server didn't really make a difference since our desserts had cream and chocolate and if he made some kind of comment to me like \"hey old lady, I know you have allergies so I wanna let you know that this dessert right here is loaded with mouthwatering chocolates you can't have\" or \"I know it sucks to be you since that cake over there is made of the creamiest cream that the world's mighty Chefs would die for\" then the customer would really feel special. I didn't.   Since we opted for the risky #Omakase style dining, it felt like sharing your deepest secret to a friend because you \"leave it up to him or her\" and trust them completely but they negate it anyway. So that little yet critical move could be improved.   Now why am I pointing these things out? I care about the customer experience and I know how these things are areas they can improve on. Yes, I care because I want to bring people back with me here. If I didn't care, I'd fake it and just shut up, just like relationships, right?!   AMBIANCE: 10  NOISE LEVEL: 10 Just right. not sure if there was piped in music.   TEMPERATURE: 10. It felt a little warm so I had to take off my jacket but maybe because I've already going thru a woman's big M. No hot flashes but man I was I hot.  Let's make that clear I was talking about my body temperature  FOOD: Loved, loved, loved the presentation. Every single dish that landed on our table reminded me of a person who took the time to make himself look good. They all looked spectacularly beautiful and impressive but the freshness of our last dish which was made up of raw sushi did not impress this sushi connoisseur.",

In fact, those ribs (off the appetizer menu) was probably the best thing i ate in vegas and i'm a total sushi whore. GET IT.",

She walked us to our table through the beautiful bar/lounge and past the sushi bar. We were sat at a table in the main dining room, she let us know our servers name, handed us our menus, and went back to the front. Our server was Aries for the night and he was absolutely amazing. We had questions about sake, he listened to what we liked departed and came back with 3 recommendations. We still didn't know what to choose so he chose for us and it was delicious. We started our meal off with beef carpaccio, spicy tuna tacos, foie gras topped oysters, and fried shrimp. Everything was absolutely delicious. Best carpaccio we have had in the city. The tacos are \"spicy\" it's all flavor and not too spicy. The oysters melt in your mouth, and the fried shrimp was big enough to be an entree. Manager Jeff came by the table a few times throughout the course of us trying almost every appetizer on the menu. Jeff was very social and asked out feedback on the dishes as well as what brought us out for dinner. After filling up quickly on appetizers we decided to go directly to dessert. We ordered the chocolate dish that is served by pouring fire on top of a sphere that reveals the inside as well as the cheesecake. Both desserts were out of this world. All around an amazing expletive from the hostess, to Aries our server, and manager Jeff. The food was great and the service was even better. This is a must when visiting the MGM.",

The Wasabi had some texture to it which means it must have been grated from fresh wasabi root. The deserts definitely had the wow factor, the fiery chocolate tart was burned in front of the diners, reminiscent of Smores around the campfire, instead of firewood the waiters at Morimoto melted the chocolate with Rum.   Ambiance: The decor shows pictures places in japan and a statue of a smiling morimoto made of kimono cloth. Clean and well maintained.  Service: Service was excellent, the attention to detail as well explanations of the food being served and how to eat it were clear.   Overall: It's a great place for dates, and great for a foodie adventure it is a bit pricey but you end the meal with great experience.",

I've had better sushi else where.  Ordered the oyster foie gras to start. Steamed oysters topped with uni and foie gras. If they can just use a slightly bigger and more briny oysters, maybe it'll be even better.   Ordered the Chef's choice sushi, the fish are good, rice perfectly seasoned. Unfortunately, what didn't work for me is the portion of the rice. Way too much rice. I've been to countless sushi restaurants around the world, this place might have the most rice. I don't think I've got a small mouth, but seriously, I don't know how girls can eat the sushi in one bite. Maybe some adjustments?  After stuffing myself with all the sushi rice. I decided to ordered some sorbet. Great colours and presentation, but not the best sorbet I had.   It's just unfortunate that I can only give a 3 star review to an iron chef restaurant. I might be a bit more picky than your average Joe, but I was expecting more than average. We are talking about  Vegas + Iron Chef here.",

Why not try this place I thought, it's connected to the towers and the Grand and has a famous guy's name on the sign.   Upon arrival I was greeted by a very efficient and friendly hostess who offered me a seat at the sushi bar or a table ...it was early Friday night and the place wasn't busy yet.   My waiter was great,  explained everything on the menu to me.  I opted to start with the whitefish carpaccio, which came plated with a large amount of mixed greens - it was very good, but the excellent taste of the fish was overpowered by the very heavy coating of dressing on the salad.   My advice, ask for light dressing so you can enjoy the taste of the fish.   Moved on to the braised cod, again, very heavy on the sauce...and I SWEAR the glaze tasted exactly like the VH sauce from the jar (although I'm sure it wasn't, right??).  Everything plated very nice and cooked perfectly.  A little pricy, but someone has to pay for the Morimoto name",

    "text": "We had a large group and since we had the foresight to make a reservation, we were seated promptly. The waiter gave us the hard sell on the tasting menu though he could offer no tantalizing details about that option. That combined with the price convinced us it wasn't a good fit for our large group. No problem, waiter decides he can offer us less food for less cost per person. It was boggling. We ordered off the menu. And seemingly in different time zones. The food arrived at unreasonable intervals. We were assured this was normal. (Ah, Doy!) But that doesn't explain why a steak came out well ahead of my delicate fish dish. Well ahead. The food was good, the service kinda hard to detect and overall the experience just annoying. The food would be better if the experience was improved - two entrees that should always be served simultaneously.",

The food however was good and above average but clearly not up to the same standards as the boca location.  We had a wide variety of dishes that waiter suggested. One however could only be described as fish spam - not good.  One other negative was the waiter asked if anyone had food allergies - one of our party is lactose intolerant - he acknowledged it and brought out cream cheese with the fish spam - and set it in front of the guy - hmmmm.  Overall a solid four but not worth the price given the average to slightly above average of the dishes.",

There was a steamed clam topped with foie gras which was a really delicious combination and also a seared wagyu carpaccio with a very light oil sauce that basically melted in your mouth.  The sushi was great and I added a few more pieces because hey, why not, you're in Vegas!  And of course, can't forget the sake - just trust them unless you really know what you're doing.  What really stood out was the service which starts with Monica and Jim but their example is followed by the entire team.  Can't wait to go back!",

Making the reservation was a breeze, we choose the \"surprise me\" option and the waiter chose or dishes for us based on our budget- and there is not a single thing I didn't absolutely love! Here's what we had from what I remember: Some kind of whitefish tacos- BOMB. Marinated fish, simply dressed with perfectly crunchy shells. Sea Bass Salad- the sea bass what marinated in a ginger soy sauce and surrounded a greens salad with a lemon-line vinaigrette. A+ Sushi/Sashimi- too many to name! We told him we wanted ~40% sushi, and he definitely delivered. All the nigiri had a bit of wasabi between the gosh and rice, so watch out for that. Marinated Cod- literally fell apart. So good. I can't recommend this place enough. And Prince our waiter did a fantastic job, ask for him when you go!",

    "text": "Fresh fish and solid sushi but not worth the price or the hype.   Don't get me wrong, the fish was super fresh and the portions of fish were sizeable, however for $135 dollars I was expecting something more tus just your Americanized sushi bar. I got the chefs sushi sampler and I was blown away by the amount of food I got. Unfortunately they are making up for quality with quantity.   The Chef's sushi sampler was an assortment of nigiri (hamachi, Saba, unagi, salmon, shrimp, tuna and fatty tuna) with three maki rolls: a beautiful symmetric mosaic roll, a mackerel and chives roll and your standard shrimp tempura roll. As I said, the fish was great, fresh and big portions. I got real grated wasabi (not just horseradish with green food coloring) and the fatty tuna was buttery and melt in your mouth  fresh, however the rolls were disappointing. The mackerel and chives roll was overpowered by the chives, and the ebi tempura roll was forgettable. I would have much rather had tako or even a spicy tuna roll Instead.   The service was also not what I would expect from Morimoto. I arrived at 5 pm so that it wouldn't be too crowded. The hostess that took me to my table either was having a bad day or has resting b*tch face syndrome. One of the staff members gave me a plate of sashimi (which I thought was part of my chef's special) and then another one took it away a few minutes later. Lucky for them and the guy who ordered the sashimi, I hadn't put my chopsticks on the sashimi plate yet. This made me somewhat sad as I was given an awesome sashimi plate, gotten my hopes up and then it was taken away with no apology or acknowledgement from the server.   My server was attentive and the food was prepared quickly, however once I paid and left, not the sushi chefs at the bar where I was sitting, not the wait staff, not even the hostesses said anything on my way out. It made me feel as if they were thinking: \"great, we got his money, we don't have to be nice or care if he comes back or not\"  I don't know if I'd come back. I didn't find the chefs selection particularly creative or inspired especially compared to other sushi places or sushi Ota in San Diego. The service was alright I guess, but I rather see a show with that money instead of spending it on decent sushi.",

We stayed away from sushi and sashimi since we have plenty of good places in bay area.   We ordered oyster w foie gras and uni. This was rich & flavorful! How can you go wrong with uni and foie gras in oyster?!? It is on the sweeter side. But it was still great. Def worth trying.   green tea cold noodle. pass on it. For that $$ you can get better noodles at home. They cooked the noodle perfectly and sauce was good. Need more soy sauce/salt.   Duck confi fried rice. two thumbs up! so good!! Def worth the try.   My mom had a tonight's special w Alaska snapper w shaved caviar. She loved it.   My husband and I had the yellow tail 'bop' and the pork 'bop.' (i forget the actual name of the dishes). Basically it's a bi bim bop in its fancy pantsy glory. Super tasty, but it was not worth $35 per 'bop.' Husband and i agree.. we'd probably pay $25 for it. Again the mark-ups due to his name.   Then we had sorbet and fiery chocolate ball dessert. Both were delicious!   Overall, great experience.. great food! Really tasty. Most of the dishes.. we gladly pay $5-10 less than what they charged.",

We followed the waiter's recommendation of one appetizer and one entree per person to share with the table.   We had the beef carpaccio, short ribs and rock shrimp tempura.  All three dishes were delicious! My favorite app was the beef carpaccio.  For dinner, we ordered the pork belly bib bim bap (this was cooked at the table), the black cod and the rock fish.  The rock fish came whole and was so tender.  The black cod was extremely flavorful and was my favorite main dish. The bib bim bap was probably the best I've ever had.

I had just got down having a big dinner but it didn't mean I couldn't squeeze in a snack. I grabbed a seat in the bar area and ordered a few plates of Oyster foie gras. These were easily the most I've ever spent on oysters and were worth it. The combination of the oysters, seared foie gras and teriyaki sauce was great. The oysters also included uni that didn't stand out enough to justify it's presence but I guess you can say it adds to the oysters somehow.   Oysters and beers were it for this order leaving this to be more of a \"To Be Continued\" type of review rather than a full review. I plan to return for steaks & sushi which I'm sure will change my current rating. Not enough to fully review but the oysters alone definitely earns four stars.  Dinner 4/3/2018",

I ordered the \"whole roasted lobster epice\", a whimsical treat for your pallet with garam masala, served with lemon creme fresh and fresh roasted vegetables.  Quite possibly one of the best lobster dish I have ever had. Every bite was embraced and I literally closed my eyes to enhance the experience of all the flavors in my mouth. Yes, it was that good!  For dessert, we were served a complimentary dessert since it was my birthday. We also ordered the fiery salty caramel chocolate tart. This dessert is to be experienced at least once in your life, if only for the presentation...  I will definitely be back to Morimoto's.  It's my favorite restaurant. Like all of Chef Morimoto's creations, everything i've had so far had a beautiful, artistic presentation. The food is perfection. The service is top notch. The ambiance mirrors delicate Japanese beauty and elegance with exotic photographs by Yasumichi Morita.   I will certainly be back again...",

The favorite was the Oyster Foie Gras, this dish was so good, I could've eaten the whole order myself! We also got the sushi combination, the fish was cut so well and the rice was made perfectly, every bite was melt in your mouth. The 16 oz Snake River Farm Ribeye was delicious, it comes on a hot plate with a sauce, but you don't even need the sauce and the steak was cooked perfectly to a medium rare. The Duck Confit Fried Rice was really good as well, I only wish that there was more! Then we finished it off with the Blueberry Panna Cotta, it was so good, not too sweet and super creamy, and I'm usually not a dessert person.  The quality of the food here is superb and it reflects in the price, but I believe that you get what you pay for. The service was super attentive and the staff are all very nice. The dress code is casual and a reservation was easy to make the same day for a Saturday on Memorial weekend. I would definitely come here again.",

To see him cook and compete is like watching Boccelli perform live. Sensational and out of this world. His stye of  creative dishes look like works of art, and his knife skills? unreal. He Trully is a maser chef. I only wish he was there when i dined at his restaurant...Out of all my fine dining indulging dining experiences during my stay in Las Vegas this was literally the highlight.   Toro Tartar was exquisite, rich and buttery. The sauces which came with the dish paired with the tartar. The sushi nigiri combo was excellent. Perfect ratio of fish to rice which was cooked perfectly. The cod was was like butter and not to sweet. The Morimoto sushi appetizer delectable. The duck duck goose was my favorite. Drawn to the dish right away such a cool concept excellent flavor, and simply delicious. The wagyu carpaccio to die for.   The whole experience blew me away. And the service was stellar, dishes were timely replaced and drinks constantly refilled. Hands down the experience was exceptional from start to finish",

Can't miss it.  We were seated immediately and the staff was very courteous and welcoming. As soon as the host seated us, the server came out almost immediately and asked us if it was our first time so he could help us with our menu.  The server was seen walking back and forth and was visible the entire we were there so if we needed anything, we could get his attention right away.   The place is well decorated and spacious in their seating. They can also accommodate large parties as well.  The sushi was of superb quality. They also have many options fo sake.  We walked out with a $400 bill but we thought it was well worth it for every item that we had.  Will definitely come back when I am back in Vegas",

I had told them I had a shellfish allergy and they were really on top of making sure nothing was cross contaminated and that I was ordering things which were okay. To star we ordered the pork chashu salad (which is big enough for more than one person), the osyters, and the gyoza. All of this was delicious. The oysters came with foie gras on them and were just amazing. The salad was a tad spicy, but oh so good. The gyozas were also really delicious. For the main course, we ordered their seared snapper, ishi taki chashu bop, and the ishi yaki buri bop. The bops they come and complete the bowl and stir it together tableside which we thought was neat. These were really good and filling. The seared snapper did not disappoint either. When it came to dessert, we had to try their signature caramel dish and the dessert sushi. The sushi was done so nicely and it was delicious. The caramel dish was exquisite. The presentation is just amazing. The reason for 4/5 stars is because we asked for hot sake and got cold and the waiter at times was a missing in action. They also brought us out the wrong bowls in the beginning and we had to send them back because they contained the wrong protein.",

It was deliciously buttery and the sauce was not too sweet.   The sushi combination for $100 for 20 pieces was fresh and a solid pick but nothing special.   The chirashi sushi bowl however was otherworldly!  This dish was packed with huge chunks of fresh cut fish, not the scraps you usually get. The assortment of fish and quality was amazing.

I don't eat much rice, but thought I would give it a try here. Both the salmon and the rice melted in my mouth with each bite. The service and decor were over the top. I didn't even have to look up for a second and my dirty plate was taken away. The prices are a little more than some places, but honestly I do think it's on point. The quality is through the roof.

The pork chop was overcooked slightly. The chicken also slightly overcooked. Sushi was very cold. It was all good. It did not give our favorite Minneapolis Japanese restaurants a run for the money and fell far below New York places that we love.   Our server was like the interrupting cow joke. He would sneak up behind me and \"Moooooooo!\" and interrupt every single fugging time. He seemed inexperienced and downright rude at times.   Basically this was a $250 disappointment. I think if you have cash to blow and you don't have high expectations... Go for it.   Otherwise, I'd skip.",

The desserts we had was tofu mousse (perfect sweetness) and the fiery chocolate tart was so good and a great way to top off the night).  Truly an outstanding place to indulge! Hats off to the iron chef!",

    "text": "I thought that the novelty of eating at an iron chef's restaurant would wear off and the food would just be like any other nice restaurant. However, it really wasn't and the experience was great throughout the whole night!  First off, the service was fantastic. My glass was never half full (they managed to do this without feeling over bearing), and our waiter Jeff was so knowledgeable and polite. He even offered to create a menu for us based on tastes that we told him we enjoyed.  We passed on his offer, however, but were really happy with our choices. The yellowtail buri bop seems like a typical rice dish on paper, but it turns out to be quite the experience! They bring out a blazing hot stone bowl with rice and yellowtail sashimi in it. They then sear the raw fish in the sides of the bowl and fry the rice with an egg and sweet soy sauce. In the end, you get a delicious bowl of sweet rice and perfectly tender and seared fish. It was amazing.  The Morimoto chirashi was probably the best dish we got and the best chirashi I've had. It came with tons of variety (menu says 10-12) including salmon, tuna, octopus, egg, salmon roe, yellow tail, eel and some other types of fish that I gladly devoured without knowing what they were.  All this was served on top of delicious sushi rice and it just all tasted so good. I usually scarf down my food but I made sure to savor every bit because it was just that good!  Like I said, eating here is an entire experience. The servers are so knowledgeable and have that typical Japanese politeness and kindness. Like they say, Chef Morimoto really blended Japanese cuisine with a lot of other cuisines, and you can tell from the menu. There is not only fresh sushi, but also a lot of other types of meats and fish from different cultures and inspirations. It's definitely pricy, being in the MGM and all, but you're in Vegas so what can you expect? I'd say it's a beautiful experience, just like any Vegas show that you'd go to, and it's worth the try!",

    "text": "I will be upfront, I visited Morimoto a couple years ago when I was staying at the MGM Grand. Since I am staying at the MGM next month, then I was reminiscing and remembering my amazing dinner. One major note for people eating on a budget, it's expensive. You're paying for an amazing dinner, and I believe everyone should treat themselves; however, for my dad and I it was about a 250-300 dinner. Granted, we got drinks which was probably a third of the bill which isn't uncommon at all at a nice restaurant, but be mindful this will not be a cheap dinner.  For starters we tried at the time a sashimi sampler which was organized with 6 pieces in a rainbow tower of various high quality fish. Meanwhile I had a steak, not A-5 Wagyu or Kobe, my dad had an amazing pork dish, and both of us had desert. Each dish was exceptional, and it definitely had a Japanese flair to it. I say flair because you aren't going here for typical Izakaya dishes, or a typical Ramen joint. These are upscale dishes with inspiration of Japanese cooking, or taking something traditional and elevating it in a modern and exciting way. Similar to a new-American restaurant, or a high class French restaurant that takes traditional cuisine to another level. I am mentioning this since you shouldn't expect Morimoto to be a typical Japanese restaurant, and you have to expect a high-class Japanese restaurant that would likely be at least 1, but most likely 2-3 Michelin stars in Japan.   I apologize I am not going into more details of each dish since it was 2 years ago, and I mostly recall it as having an amazing meal of top quality. On top of that, it's near the Casino floor, and you don't have to dress up for it. There are plenty of people wearing shorts with a collar shirt, and the nice thing about many good to great Vegas restaurants is you can get in on the night of, minus some weekends or a big night like Valentines.",

We had edamame, Morimotos' famous sashimi, an amazing rice bowl which was prepared with an egg yolk in a flaming hot pot tableside, sticky ribs, and a selection of sushi rolls.   Everything I tasted was super delicious, fresh, and bursting with flavour. The sushi rolls we had were hands down the best I have ever had.

As soon as I took my seat I was warmly greeted by my server, Keiko.  I took a minute to peruse the menu and decided to begin my evening with their Sake Flight. It consisted of four different selections that ranged from light and floral to dark and smokey. My favorite was aged like a whiskey and was a fantastic sipper.  I chose the $50.00 Sushi Sampler, which includes a Spicy Tuna Roll and ten different pieces of Sushi. Everything was impeccably fresh and beautifully presented. The only piece I didn't like was the Mackerel. It was just too fishy for me. In the future, I would probably skip the sampler and just order the Sushi individually. I might spend a little more, but I'd get exactly what I like.  I had originally planned to try something off the Dinner Menu, but since it was my last night in Vegas and assurances from my server that it wasn't \"too heavy\", I decided to try the Fiery, Salty Caramel Chocolate Tart. It was definitely worth the splurge. The combination of flavors and textures matched the flamboyant presentation.  Morimoto is wheelchair accessible (including the Sushi Bar). Service was friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back. Next time we'll sit in the Dining Room and order off the Dinner Menu.",

Since it's a Japanese restaurant I tried to stick to the Japanese dishes like the chirashi, chef's combination sushi, soft shell crab roll and Hamachi kama. The fish was pretty fresh but the fish in my chirashi was cut into various random shapes which makes me feel like they are using scrap fish.   Service was great and they were speedy with our order since we were time crunched to go to a show.  However the flavor and the expectations of a Japanese restaurant weren't met for me.

    "text": "Okay i abmit it, as cliche' as it is i came here because I like to pretend I am a culinary aficianado through my vast nunber of Iron Chef viewings.....and boy I am glad i did. I must be honest with you from the onset, you are reading a review of a sushi resteraunt from someone who doesn't eat sushi.....ussually.   First things first, make a reservation and if you're feeling frisky sit at the tepa bar because there is a different menu then the resteraunt.   SECOND, ORDER THE APPETIZER RIBS....youre welcome. Dont waste your time on the gyoza, we didnt finish them, they seem to have so much ginger to mask some other flavor that is very unappetizing.   Third, get yourself the sake' flight. We didnt have reservations and sat at the bar.  The tender, JJ, was amazing.  She reccomeded this flight and knowing nothing about sake' i was happy to accept the reccomendation.  I didnt realize how much i loved sake'!   It was truly a blessing to have her lead us in our culinary trip.  She spoke so highly of Chef Morimoto, let us know he was a really awesome boss and explained his love for sake' and background which made me want to love eating here. And boy did I.   From there we had the tempura shrimp rolls (I know not real sushi).  I have been craving these since the day we left! Something about the crunchy shrimp center mixed with the perfect texture of the rice had my taste buds craving more.  I think it was may favorite menu item.  Things were going so well we stepped out of our box and tried the spicy salmon rolls; phenominal.  Not a hint of fishyness or that weird weedy flavor you get with cheap roll.    We followed up by sharing the bop fried rice which is made tableside in a 400 degree bowl.  The chef arrived at out table and explained the process while cracking the farm fresh egg mixing it with in house milled rice, and  of course the secret soy sauce recipe. We opted for the kobe beef, but it is quite pricey. All waitstaff say the chicken or fish is also very good.  It is quite a dramatic presentation and well worth the attention.   We ended the meal with the salted carmel chocolate marshmello ball which is lit on fire utilizing 151 alcohol.  As we watched the chocolate ball melt into the marshmello goodness we knew we made the perfect choice to end our meal.  Our meal ended as dramatically as it started.    The theme here is presentation and Chef Morimoto is nothing short of perfect.  The only thing i didnt like about my meal is that it was over,  and the gyoza, but given the perfection of the rest of our culinary experience i would still say Chef Morimoto hit a home run with this Vegas culinary experience.",

Each dish is prepared with the best ingredients and a refined skill.    After trying several dishes with my group it was difficult to pick out which ones were best because they were all amazing in their own right. On the day we were there Morimoto himself was walking the room and greeting guests.  How cool!  We tried the Sushi sampler and it was probably the best I have had. Each piece was constructed flawlessly.    The sticky ribs app was also very tasty.  The meat was so tender and flavored with this extra gooey BBQ sauce. Yum!   So many amazing dishes you have to go and experience yourself.",

Chef Morimoto made his debut and transitioned to the American version where he eventually battled Bobby Flay (how dare he stand on his cutting board)!!!  Anyways, I digress. The restaurant that bears his name was an impromptu stop for us in Las Vegas and I am super glad we did. I headed the cries of the yelp verse and we ordered the Tuna Pizza, surf and turf and the spider crab roll.   Do yourself a dam favor and order the Tuna Pizza. It's a crisp tortilla with thin slices of tuna topped with sliced jalapeno micro greens and drizzled with a spicy creamy sauce. Order this! It had to be hands down the surprise and best dish we ordered while there. I would have ordered more and maybe just this next time.   The surf and Turf was a wagyu portion cooked topped with potato crumbles and the surf was a hamachi sashimi served with a chili oil. This was also good, although I would have liked the beef to have been cooked or medium rare..... but the person I was with wanted medium and I had to compromise. The hamachi was super delicious! I would trek carefully with this, it was good, but not memorable.   The spider roll tasted like any other spider roll ive tried. Didn't really taste special... I may have been day dreaming of the tuna pizza at this moment, so that probably skewed my perception..",

I didn't try the Uni but my brother said it was the best he's ever had and he tries the Uni at every sushi spot he goes to. The wagyu beef carpaccio was the BEST as were the tamarind braised short ribs - so I guess there were two bests. I have never wanted there to be more ribs so badly though. The Miso soup was amazing and they make each order FRESH - not just taking a ladle out of a pot and serving it to you. Now the entrees. Do the BURI BOP. Steve, our guide through this culinary feast, strongly recommended we do this, so we did, with the yellow tail. It was probably the best thing we ordered and we didn't leave even one grain of rice there. We had just had the pleasure of dining on Wagyu steak at their neighboring restaurant, but the wagyu filet here was even better. ok, now to desert, which again steve is the silent hero on. GET THE CHEESECAKE SOUFFLE. JUST GET IT! And also, get the Fiery Chocolate Tart. Trust me. when your chocolate shell is lit on fire by spiced rum and melts into the marshmallow icecream, you're going to thank me. and steve.  Did I mention our waiter Steve? steve will guide you through your adventure at Morimoto. Choose steve. Enjoy!",

Everything was spectacular.  The fish was soo fresh and it just melted in your mouth, you almost didn't even need the soysauce.  The oysters and other appetizers we got were also amazing. I haven't had a dine in experience like this. Sushi hasn't been the same for me yet being back in Dallas after this vacation meal.   Definitely worth a try, definitely not on the cheap end, but if  you are wanting spurge, you are staying at MGM GRAND and looking to eat great sushi. This is the place to try!

But it took a very lengthy time for our waiter to take our orders. After a long time, we asked two different 'busboys' to get our server. He eventually came by and said he needed to put something down and he would take our order. Except... he didn't come back. We had to ask others again.  But we did eventually get our order in. The tuna tartare pizza is really delicious. It's why i gave an extra star. I got chefs choice sushi combo $55 and then an additional 3 more sushi pieces. Each sushi order only comes with one piece for $9-12 a piece. That's ok. I've been to Japanese restaurants that charge for 1 piece. I got my sushi and it looked great. It wasn't. The fish quality was just ok but it was the rice that was the problem. The rice was hard and it ruined the entire meal. Rice should be fluffy and it's half the meal. But this rice texture was the same as prepacked refrigerated sushi. It was hard and cold. Every single piece. My bill was almost $100 for 13 pieces of sushi and tax. It would be totally ok if the sushi was good and enjoyable.   This was such a disappointing experience. I really hope this was just an off night for them. Both in food and service.",

    "text": "Ordered the 20pcs $100 sushi combo.  While the service is great, the sushi was probably similar to conveyer belt sushi standard in Japan.  First, the white fish are relatively flavorless - no umami flavor from kombu marinate or things like that.  Even the chu-toro does not have the umami flavor - taste very much like akami.  Secondly, there are too much rice for the portion of the fish.  The rice is too dense as well - more like onigiri than sushi.  Finally, the rice temperature is a bit too cold.  Was it refrigerated before?  Overall, probably relatively good compare with other mid end sushi place around the area, but subpar for this price point when compared to places in CA or Seattle, let alone Japan.",

Just be prepared for two things: sticker shock as the food here is a bit on the pricey side, and don't expect all the food to come out at the same time.  Our server informed us that the food is brought to the table as it is finished preparing - this can be typical in Japanese restaurants where the freshness of the meal is enhanced by bringing it to you as soon as it is finished.  However, we did receive all our orders fairly close to each other, so the wait wasn't too long.  As a beer drinker, I tried one of Morimoto's signature brews - brewed by Rogue Brewery, and it was wonderful!",

My favorite dishes from the menu that I tried were the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, White Fish Carpaccio, and the Ribeye.  Both managers Sandra and Karen stopped by at our table to see how our dinner was throughout the experience dining there which is a great touch because a lot of other restaurants on the strip you don't see that everytime when dining in a fine dining restaurant.

Menu is severely limited and that's okay for a real sushi place , but when I asked for specialty items like scallop hand rolls , or anything resembling a volcano roll or rainbow roll I was told , too busy to venture off the menu.  Well the menu is so limited it actually sucks , then your paying 9 - 12 for a generic roll and 35.00 for a chirashi bowl !  Sorry but never again .... Sake is 28.00 and that's the house sake ...haha , I miss sushi on Tropicana right now",

There are many other places on the strip or in the Greater Las Vegas area that will give you better service  and/or  better food.  This is just not a four star sushi place as I have envisioned. To me, going to a Morimoto restaurant should be an event - to enjoy dining and to be catered to.  This is not quite that standard..  The food quality is OK, in fact quite good. But it is not exceptional and not memorable.  A 3 star rating is based on the Morimoto name. Were this a Sushi XXX place, I would have rated it a 4 star.",

    "text": "So I am a foodie, I plan meals on vacation more than activities. I spend time reading reviews to weed out the crazies who give a restaurant one star bc they showed up at 7pm on a weekend night and are pissed they have to wait, I love high end food and unique food served in quirky places. My absolute favorite BBQ is served in a gas station in SC. That said, my Morimoto fan girl came out in full force when I saw his new restaurant at MGM. This is his ONLY teppan restaurant outside of Tokyo and OMG it was amazing! Now let me start by telling you this is NOT your run of the mill teppan with mass amounts of food for $20 and yum yum sauce. This is an experience, a high end,  a la carte meal that will leave you super satisfied. It is not cheap but the service, food and ambiance are worth it. Lenin (teppan chef), TJ (sommelier) and Norberto (server) were great. We had the beef carpaccio as an app (yum); the filet, scallops and fried rice as an entree...I am still dreaming about.... and the donuts as a desert. Loved this place! I mean loved it. The sauces/dips were amazing, the food was amazing, the service was amazing! I want to go back....today. Anyone want to fly to Vegas with me? If you want a cool experience you can't have anywhere else in the US go here.",

Maybe its because living on the westside of LA completely spoils you for Japanese food elsewhere, but all the food here felt merely adequate. It is easily beaten by cheaper options in LA like Sugarfish, the sushi was just okay by those standards.   What was not okay is the price. The menu is eyewateringly expensive, and i thought Nobu was on the pricier side. Frankly we had a much better meal at Nobu for a similar price, that felt worth it.

We dined at Morimoto in Hawaii shortly after it opened (it is now closed) and it was AMAZING, so to say we had high expectations for his Vegas restaurant would be an understatement. The food, the ambiance, the cocktails, and the service completely blew us out of the water. We had reservations last Monday evening, and the food was so delicious that we returned on Thursday. On Monday we sat at a table and ordered cocktails, the shrimp tempura roll and the tempura fried shrimp as appetizers, I had the surf and turf with American wagyu and hamachi, my husband had the lobster, and we shared the chocolate tart sphere for dessert. We could not stop talking about the meal our entire trip, and the tempura shrimp sushi roll stole the show! When we returned later in the week we sat at the sushi bar and I ordered it again (yes, it was so good that I ate it two of our five dinners on our trip!!!). My husband had the chef's selection sushi tasting menu. We had sorbet for dessert. The service is fantastic, and the restaurant is very inviting. Everything was simply amazing and was far better than we could have imagined!!! This is a MUST for everyone to try!!",

    "text": "To begin, I do want to say that the food was out of this world.  I wish I could give this place 5 stars....but...  For appetizers we had the Tuna Pizza and the Oyster Foie Gras.  The oyster was in the top 5 bites of food I've ever tasted.  We also had the 10 piece sushi platter along with the pork chop.  Again the sushi was out of this world, and undoubtedly best pork chop I've ever had.  Now why did I only give the restaurant only 3 stars.  First, we made a reservation at 5:30 because we were seeing Phish on Halloween.  The arena was approximately a 3 minute walk from the restaurant.  We wanted to go into the arena no later than 7:15 to avoid the rush.  I was taking my girlfriend for dinner so we had one \"swanky\" food experience.  Plus I have never had a chance to eat Morimoto's food and have wanted to since I was obsessed with Japanese Iron Chef.  Next, we ordered food and I asked for a sake selection.  Told this would go good with my appetizers.  Then it arrives 3/4 of the way though the appetizers.  What do you think would have come next??  Pork Chop.  Again, where is my delicate tasting sushi.  Well it's now in front of us and hot.  See above re: Pork Chop.  And now we wait, and wait, and wait for sushi to arrive. Seems odd since there are 7 sushi chefs and place wasn't packed.  At some point our server brings over a small amt of soy sauce to dip sushi in. (I prefer the it this way).  We eventually inquire and we are then told expediting it.  Then for another while many \"I'm Sorry.\"  So it comes, we inhale it cause it's already 7:15. (and our mouth's take like pork chop).  Was very interested in the flaming chocolate thing, but alas we are out of time.  Hurriedly pay the bill and run out of there.  Now, I am not one to ask for something from them, but c'mon, nothing, no gesture....oh and many more \"I'm sorry\".  I was prepared to spend good money, but yea.  Any FWIW, food was unreal, service was not.",

Anyway, Morimoto's opened about 3 months ago, so they were very eager to please and provide excellent service.  We did not order sushi but I must say, the sushi bar looks fabulous!  We shared about five items off the regular menu.  We had two appetizers and three Entrees.  Entrees included: Black Cod, Angry Chicken, Yellowtail served in a bowl that was 450 degrees and cooked table side.  Every item was cooked to perfection. We finished the meal with the flaming chocolate dessert - it tasted absolutely fabulous - a good mix of light froth and heavy darker chocolate.  Service was excellent.  Only complaint - specialty cocktails average about $17 each!",

The foie, uni, oyster shooter was over powered by teriyaki and the flavor of oyster took over the whole dish not in a pleasant way.  I did not taste the uni at all! One of the shooters had a tiny bit of uni while another had a much bigger piece. The Green Bean seasoning lacked salt, like they threw it together, forgot the salt and forgot to care!!  The lobster was dry and not very pleasant. We ordered the 10 piece nigiri tasting * 3 thinking they would give us their best.  It came with 3 rolls which one was prepared strictly for looks and was terrible to actually eat.  It was honestly to much filler, to much to consume and enjoy. In this case someone not looking for an amazing bite each time, the kind that makes you close your eyes and think dam this is good....well you're not going to get that here...unless you're use to bad sushi joints in the first place. I highly recommend you spend your hard earned dollars at another place.  Not to mention the service was comparable to a small chain restaurant such as Applebee's or chili's.  Wow!! I don't mind spending some $$$ on some good food but when they screw me over like his it really puts me in a bad mood!",

    "text": "Best restaurant in Las Vegas. From the attention to details to the food, everything was absolutely wonderful. Every person there knew our names, so they address us with our names, that's a very nice touch. When we walked in everyone stopped with what they're doing to face us and gave us a welcome. The napkins on the table were white, but since my girlfriend had on a black dress they came back and gave her a black napkin instead.   The server was VERY attentive, with very great knowledge on the food and the culture of the food. I can tell that all the servers had great admiration to Chef Morimoto, when they talked about him, and how he developed his culinary skills. Just listening to the server passionately talk about the cuisine made us fall in love with the restaurant.   Food was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. One of the best sushi and sashimi I've had in a while. I had the Toro tartare, and the flavors of the condiments on the see through dish worked really well with the Toro. The fish tacos, my favorite, was an explosion of flavor in the mouth, definitely orgasmic. (I'm not exaggerating at all) The sushi was very fresh and cut perfectly, and the rice was perfect. I'm very particular about sushi and this was grade A.",

Nothing particularly notable, but good. Shishito peppers were the best I've had. We didn't have steak so I can't comment on that.

The Morimoto-style chirashi bowl was also very good and worth it for the price. Would honestly stick to that after having tried their omakase for the first time. Honestly, the surf and turf was the only thing that was majorly disappointing (the steak wasn't that great). Despite those small things, I'm definitely coming here again every time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Save your money, go somewhere else if you are a fan of high-end Jap-asian fusion.   We had high expectations for this place because Morimoto's name but this may be our fault for thinking it would be worth the money. My wife having lived and worked in and for a Japanese company for many years, has had the chance to experience great traditional and exquisite fusion cuisine form Japan. I also have traveled well around east Asia experiencing the best of local cuisines and flavours the region has to offer. .   The food was good... Ingredients were all very fresh which is a standard. We were however disappointed with the lack of training and knowledge the servers had of the menu. Two dishes in particular caught our attention and we asked question about them. The Chirashi sushi traditionally is served on a bed of super chilled rice, or for very high end restaurants they serve it as platter with a bowl on the side. We asked the server in this case of it was served as \"Chirashi-don\" which he answered \"no\". This implied that it would have been served on a bed of ice with rice on the side. This was incorrect as it came on a bowl of rice so big which a high end Japanese restaurant should never ever do (fill their customer's up with rice). This seemed like a cheap tactic to offload a lot of unusable sushi/sashimi fish for a high price. It was tasty but because we assumed it would have been served on ice with a side of rice we ordered a bit more food. We ordered the laksa soup with noodles. I've had traditional laksa many many times from the local regions of Asia and I have to say that this dish was nothing like you would have expected. I understand this is supposed to be fusion, but leaving the noodles inside of the thick creamy \"laksa\" boiling hot soup while you serve it just over cooks the noodles into mush. It was terrible... Honestly, I have had better laksa flavoured ramen noodles out of a package. At least shock the noodles to stop them from cooking, and reduce the temperature, allow people to dip the noodles into the overly thickened cream sauce they call laksa and it would taste 100 times better. Also... make it taste like laksa, it literally just tasted like vinegar and butter. For the price tag again not worth it; but it was the comment the server made which really put us off.  \"Well it's meant to be fusion cuisine, it's Indian not Japanese.\"  At this point we realized that Morimoto didn't hire people who understand food. It was an insult to the dish, the people of Malaysia, and his restaurant to have someone so inexperienced at the tables.   I've had better Japanese fusion food at izakaya style cafe's all over the world and for literally 1/3rd of the price.",

I have always been a fan of Nobu and Iron Chef, and I had such a wonderful experience from service to food and dessert. I wasn't thinking about a review when we were there or I would have taken pictures and taken note of the names of the employees that were so accommodating. First off, we had no reservation and it was busy, but the kind manager with long blonde hair was able to situate us in their lounge area. Service was wonderful, the tuna PIZZA was melt in your mouth heavenly. My favorite fish is tuna and the flavor that was packed into this was unreal...I am already craving it. I also really enjoyed the chocolate tart...it's a must try. Morimoto and the staff lived up to my expectations, and we will be back!",

What I didn't like is that I ordered spicy tuna tacos for an appetizer and they never came out while some of the girls were already receiving their entrees (why I'm giving a 4-star rating). When I told the waitress, she ended up coming back to me and informed me that the chef apologizes and they gave me a spicy tuna roll on the house to go along with my sushi pieces to make up for it. The ishi yaki bop was a rice dish prepared for us on the table - what I liked about this is you can add however much soy sauce you want to it.   Overall, great atmosphere, great service, great food.

    "text": "3.5 stars. I felt too guilty rounding up because I've had some places I've ranked at 4 stars and would feel terrible about putting this place in the same league.   It's all kindof fine. The sticky ribs were good. The ishi yaki buri bop was also very tasty. The sushi was fresh and nicely presented.  The sushi \"tacos\" were very forgettable. I already forgot what was in them. And the rock shrimp tempura was nice....but very small and expensive for what it is.  So it's all okay. As food goes, it's just nothing special. It's kindof like watching the TNT channel on a lazy saturday - not necessarily a waste of time, but not particularly memorable. The difference is that TNT is cheaper than Morimoto. Which is where I feel like they lose 1/2 a star. They aren't so expensive, but pricey enough that I feel like without any standout dishes, it isn't really a place to pass the time unless you just have more money, time, and calorie allotments than I do.  A bigger complaint I have is that for a place like this, service is crucial for me. At some point, nice food places (especially on the Strip), are a dime a dozen so service should be great to help distinguish a restaurant. But they lose a whole star for service. The lady refilling our drinks consistently spilled everytime she refilled without wiping away anything. When they cleared our plates, they also consistently reached across us and between us so they wouldn't have to walk around our small 4 seat table. And they kept interrupting our conversations to say \"would you like to order more food?\" So that's rude and unnecessary.   It's an okay place. If you're staying at MGM and don't feel like venturing out, then go for it. But it's not a must eat.",

Their sashimi is super fresh and the selection is incredible. The sushi is really good too. The waiter told us that they get brown rice and freshly mill the rice the day of so that the sushi rice can absorb all the flavor. The toro tartare is very unique with all the sides that you can add onto it. Everyone recommends the tuna pizza but personally I think the olives on the tuna pizza overpowers the rest of the flavors and I wouldn't recommend this dish. However we get the hamachi tacos every single time. It is super refreshing. The steak on the surf and turf is really good and comes with a little bit of crunch on top of it. For the surf part, it was sashimi and tasted really similar to the hamachi tacos and was very good. Oyster foie gras is also really good the sauce is really sweet and really balances out the flavors. A5 wagyu is definitely something you should try at least once. The service here is amazing and super accommodating. We came here on our anniversary and they gave us free cheesecake souffle with mango and passion fruit on top in the shape of sushi. It was very unique but I don't see it on the menu! If you are in Vegas it is definitely a restaurant to try :)",

Plain, no presentation. All ordered was on one plate. Crammed into one dish. We had to figure out what we were eating. For the price, compared to local like Sushi Loca  it doesn't even come close. I was on a special stayvacation so I tried but this was nothing but a disappointment. For 2 rolls and some appetizers was $190.00 was disgusting! Very disappointed! Service was horrible and most the reason for such a poor review.",

We ordered the Morimoto pork chop and apple sauce and it came over a bed of the most unique flavored kimchi I've ever had. The meat was cooked to perfection. Usually pork chops I've had are tough as it always comes out some degree of being overlooked but this dish came out deliciously juicy and I'm salivating again just writing this review. We also got a side of the duck confit fried rice which came with a sunny side/over easy egg which when mixed with the really thin and delicate pieces of rice created something amazing. (Side note: I've never had such delicate rice before and I'm Chinese) the sushi rolls were amazing and soft with fresh tuna. The staff was just the cherry on top and made the whole night amazing!",

It must have been a different location because I was not impressed at all.  There seemed to be a lack of communication BTW staff. Our server took our order (after a 30 minute wait) and once appetizers were brought, the runners placed these dishes just anywhere on the table. We had mentioned to our server as she took our order that it would be individual orders instead of family style so there would be no confusion but apparently that didn't help at all. Later we came to find out that 4 people had ordered the wagyu beef carpaccio but only 3 came out. My friend had to wait an additional hour before it finally came out... Only after everyone had finished their meals.  The food was tasty but honestly, I won't be coming back because of such poor service. I expected more especially since our entire bill came out to $2k+. I don't mind paying money for good food but when the service is that bad, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. No pun intended.",

    "text": "After much deliberation, my girlfriend and I decided to dine in Morimoto, and what a great choice it was! Everything from the ambiance to service to food was amazing.  My girlfriend ordered a White Lily, which she raved about the entire night, and I had a Sopporo, which was plenty. For food, we started out with the beef carpaccio, hamachi tacos, rock shrimp tempura, and the gyoza. For never having beef carpaccio before and not having any expectation on how it should taste, I was truly amazed. I could not stop eating it. The rock shrimp tempura was just as amazing! It came in two different sauces with Morimoto ranch on the side. I personally liked the wasabi aioli better, but my girlfriend liked the spicy one better so it worked out. The hamachi tacos are a twist on the usual taco. It comes in a fried wonton shell with guacomole, hamachi yellowtail. It had a nice citrus crisp to it, that my girlfriend definitely enjoyed. Wish we ordered more, as it comes in 3s! The gyoza was pretty good. It came on a iron plate so it came sizzling, which was very cool, and the aroma of the sake and garlic filled the room.  For entrees, we had the ishi yaki buri bop and their 8 oz filet. They cooked our bop table side, and the presentation was very entertaining to watch. The 8oz filet also came on a skillet. I would never thought to order a steak at a japanese restaurant, but I was very impressed. Seasoned very well and cooked to perfection - medium rare.  Lastly for dessert, my girlfriend and I shared the coconut mango. I liked that they had more than just chocolates for the dessert. It was the perfect combination of sweet and tart and came with a green tea sorbet, if only I wasn't so full, I would've finished it!  Our waters were never empty and they constantly cleared your plate for a new plate, so your flavors didn't mix. I would definitely be back. The quality of service and food is well worth it!",

Also this place is rather loud, you have music and noise from the hallway outside the glass. Keep in my this place is in the MGM Grand so you have to make your way threw the gauntlet of freaky individuals and smoke filled gambling areas to get to the place. So once I crossed the finish line I just wanted to chill and enjoy my drink and food, not be upsold.",

(Nobu, Zuma, Mizumi, Yellowtail etc).   The ambiance is a trendy vibe with cool art accents throughout. Love the meat display in the back room. Lots of energy.  I had to turn through many pages of sake before I even hit the wine section of the beverage list and found some great wines at premium but better than expected prices.  We had an 8 person party and enjoyed the late seating. The server was professional and friendly and handled our large boisterous group with ease.  The sushi was excellent as expected from Iron Chef Morimoto. The tuna tartare was hit for the group with its unique \"build your own bite\" approach.   The best surprise were the red meats so steak heads can feel right at home.  My third visit here, will be back soon.",

When I had questions everyone was knowledgeable about the food.  Atmosphere-casual but classy. The buzz of the restaurant was low, not loud, everyone on top of their game. I didn't have to talk loud to be heard.   Food- everything was delicious. I was very adventurous as I've never had some of the items on the menu. We had the chef's special that was a 6 course meal. This is not your casual sushi restaurant and cannot be compared to those meals. The food is an experience in itself, each course takes you on a journey. Mouthwatering, melt in your mouth, different tastes, that you enjoy with each bite.   To top it off Chef Morimoto stopped by the restaurant and we were fortunate to get a picture with him. Best Mother's Day dinner, dinner in general that I've had. I'll be back as there are other menu items I want to try. Posting only a few pictures, believe me, it tastes as wonderful as it looks.",

Well I'm glad I ignored that message.   We did pass on omikase and ordered off menu. To start he selected the Waygu carpaccio. It has an elegant, savory flavor. I chose the foie gras oysters. The richness was exquisite especially considering the saffron accent on the plate.   For our entree we shared the second level sushi selection, 9 fish selections x2 plus 2 rolls. It was perfect for the 2 of us. The toro, chu toro, salmon and snapper had fantastic melt in your mouth tenderness. Even the Ebi was some of the most flavorful shrimp with rice. The tamago made a nice finish to the plate.   So the next time I doubt picking Morimoto, I will go back to this night.",

    "text": "This is EXACTLY the type of dining experience you expect in Las Vegas. I half expect the Yakuza to walk in for their evening tea.  I was greeted by a very friendly hostess staff that seated me 20 minutes before my reservation.  While sitting at the high-top I was impressed by the initial presentation of chopsticks, glasses, and napkin, honesty something you'd see out of a traditional Japanese restaurant.  I was introduced to Jeffery (Jeff) my server for the night who was very bubbly, friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.  I placed my order of \"sticky ribs\" as an appetizer and the \"angry chicken\" as my entree.  I also ordered the Tokyo Black porter as a drink which is easily one of the best Japanese craft beers I've ever had. Jeff arrived with the porter and gave me some information on the brewery, its location, and another beer he had from the brewery. This was a HUGE plus in my book being a craft beer fan.  My sticky ribs arrive and the waiter (not Jeff) explained exactly what I was getting as it sat in front if me. What the glaze was, how it was cooked, the garnish added... how incredible is that!!  My first bite into the ribs, they were fall-off-the-bone tender. The glaze on them was magnificent. There was just enough crunch on the edges to satisfy anyone. I wolfed them down and was quickly presented with a moist towel to clean off... A+ customer service all around!  Speaking of service, the busser/water filler for my table was incredible, not missing a beat and never allowing my cup to drop below 50% as well as removing my dishes in a prompt and clean manner!  Now back to my experience, Jeff would swing by the table, checking on me just enough.   Next came in my angry chicken, again as the plate was lowered, the entire dish was explained from the sauces to what degree the chicken is cooked at. Upon finish of the explanation, I dug in.  The chicken was very moist and tender, the sauce for the chicken was out-of-this-world good! Slightly sweet but savory with a zing of peppers. The wing, breast and thigh was topped with rice noodles and surrounded by peppers. Slightly disappointed by the heat level, but I'll attribute that to my high spice tolerance.   During my meal I had to call over the manager and compliment her on Jeff and the entire meal!  I grinded to a halt as the last bits of chicken entered my mouth, quite full from my endeavor.  Jeff, kind up until the very end, easily was one of the many highlights of the meal. Definitely deserved the 40% tip. There need to be thousands of more waiters like him!  I even made sure to tip the water boy which delighted him greatly and it was deserved.  I could not recommend this restaurant enough! Morimoto hired the perfect staff to put forward his representation of Japanese-American cuisine that is to die for!",

The service was excellent and everyone was very friendly, even if they weren't your waiter.  My only criticisms would be the quality of the sushi sampler was just like that of any japanese restaurant. The rice was a little too cold and hard and the sashimi wasn't exactly \"melt in your mouth\" quality. The tuna tacos also had too much guacamole in it so you could only taste avocado and not the fish.  But overall a good experience!",

He was at the sushi station helping the other chefs and we walked in front of him and I busted my phone out to get his picture... he posed for me!!  We ended up getting a few pictures with him and he is such a nice man...doesn't speak English, but he's a cool guy.   Onto the food... the tuna pizza is to die for.  The portions are very limited, but it's a great appetizer for three people to have two pieces each.  I devoured this... so crisp and light.   My seared snapper wasn't that big of a portion but the flavor and texture.... goodness gracious.  Simply delicious.  My table also ordered the whole crispy fish (totally worth it), Chinese broccoli, and steak.  Everything was scrumptious!  This is now my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "You know you're going to have a magical experience when dining at Iron Chef's Morimoto's signature restaurant. Located in the MGM, the space and ambiance is modern and intimate with high ceilings and beautiful minimalistic decor. My boyfriend and I came here for our BAEgas trip and were definitely happy with our choice.  We started off with the chef's combination sushi, which comes with 10 pieces of nigiri and a roll. I don't quite remember all of the items included but the halibut, toro and sea bass were definitely the standouts. The fish is very fresh and up to par with some of the higher end sushi restaurants. The spicy tuna roll was one of the best I've had yet, and I don't even really care for spicy tuna rolls! This isn't your average chopped up bits and pieces of leftover tuna you don't want anymore. The roll had nice, fatty chunks of tuna along with a douse of spicy mayo.   For our entrees, we went with the ishi yaki kakuni bop and the surf and turf. Reminiscent of bibimpap, the ishi yaki kakuni bop had kakuni pork cooked over a hot stone bowl with vegetables and a jidori chicken egg, followed by a generous pour of soy and sake marinade. Once finished cooking after a nice demo from our waiter, the sweet and savory rice becomes soft and fragrant with chunks of rich, fatty, melt-in-your-mouth pork. The surf and turf included a piece of snake river farms wagyu beef and a chilled hamachi (yellowtail) crudo on the side. You really do get the best of both worlds with this dish. The wagyu beef was so tender and buttery and the combination of fried black garlic and nuoc cham flavor was just heavenly. The cold hamachi salad was a nice contrast to the beef and definitely a nice palate refresher.   Ah, but the magic doesn't stop there. We had just enough room for dessert and decided to go with the Coconut Mango. Mango mousse, coconut cake, charcoal meringue and coconut green tea sorbet topped with fresh passion fruit. Trust me when I say you've never seen a dessert like this before. I had a few reservations about how tasty this flavor combination could be but the first bite and each bite following after that was extraordinarily good.",

Unfortunately, things are on the overpriced/expensive side.   We shared a short rib appetizer and they were delicious. For entrees, we went with the Ishi Yaki Bop with yellowtail and shared sushi platter. The Ishi Taki Bop is like the Korean bibimbap with rice and veggie cooked over a hot stone bowl, with yellowtail added on the side to sear. I enjoyed this dish a lot.   The sushi platter was good with fresh fish, but nothing different from other better and less expensive sushi places I've eaten at before.   We had a good time catching up over dinner, and I'm glad we tried Chef Morimoto's place, but I don't think I will return due to the expensive price.",

The 16 ounce steak- wasn't 16 ounces... usually I order a 6 oz steak... so my husband and I shared... my half seemed more like 6oz... but I could be wrong.  It was tasty... but again... too expensive for what we got, in my opinion.  We got the pork belly appetizer- yummy- 3-4 bites... $21 again... expensive.    It was good... but not exceptional. At 40% less- this would have been 5 star.  And I think fair... a $60 steak... no sides... fair.  $90- I better think it's the best thing I have ever eaten... and no...

Now with that said this place can be busy, cause magic. Plan ahead if you have a group.  Or go as a small group and try seating in the bar area. I went to a late dinner with a friend and was immediately seated at the bar area. All the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.  So much so it can be a little overwhelming. To maximise our experience we got a couple starters and just did a large chef selection.    Did the spicy tuna tacos. They definitely have some spice and kick. Just enough to feel a little pain but not enough to detract from the flavour.  You only get 3. Share accordingly haha  Now the chef selection came with a lot of pieces. We even had them include shrimp tempura as one of the rolls. One thing I would say that makes this place magical is the flavour.  I feel they really mastered it and layered it with the proteins. Part of this is having food not straight from a fridge/freezer but at just chill to room temperature.  This can throw you off if you're not experienced but it adds so much to it. Never been anywhere else sushi wise that did this. I feel this is something very traditional that we have just missed as sushi has become Westernised.    Out of the basket where only two pieces I didn't care for. One of them had mackerel and it just wasn't for me or my friend.  Everything was great and I would definitely come again, Vegas or another location!",

It was a great choice as my parents can have difficulty hearing in louder environments and there were more people seated in that area.  The sushi and sashimi here are cut with precision and the rice is sweet, sticky and cooked to perfection. Edamame is served warm and Lightly salted just the way I like it. The arrangements of the 10 piece dinner option was colorful and symmetric. This was a return visit for myself and I'm so glad to bring the family this time to celebrate my parents 49th wedding anniversary and my husbands birthday which made me the bearer of the bill. Of course this is a Pricey sushi restaurant with a master chef calling the shots from NYC... that is to be expected. Everyone was thrilled with the dining experience so to me it was worth it.",

    "text": "The original iron chef delivers. To taste is to believe. We made reservations and was immediately seated upon arrival. Our server was exceptional..i'd say she's the google of this restaurant she knew the menu front and back, upside down. All her recommendations from the appetizers to the dessert was spot on.   Toro tartare: a playful take on tartare that just melts in your tongue, they provide a mini-shovel to scoop up the toro and mix it up with the perfect blend of condiments on the side. Crispy rice, guacamole, sour cream, wasabi and nori puree   Wagyu beef carpaccio: a perfect blend of savory beef and a yuzu type sauce, just take your chopsticks grab one side of the wagyu fold and eat.   Seafood Toban Yaki: If your looking for a warm seafood dish this beats them all. The broth gives you the layering of all its ingredients and to the generous serving of perfectly shellfish, this dish i worth every penny.   16 oz rib-eye steak: done medium-rare and served in a hot plate (you can sear the steak a little more if needed), then served with onion-garlic au jus. Ranked 1 on my steak list, perfectly seasoned, melt in your mouth primed beef and a one of a kind au jus for a little change up. Definitely a must have!   Duck Fried rice: looks can be deceiving! At first sight I thought..yeah its just rice. But when i took my first bite, every grain of rice just exploded with flavor and the egg on top just takes it over the top! A perfect complement to my steak and seafood entree.   Fiery Chocolate tart: talk about picturesque..they say you eat with your eyes..a good way to close out an excellent meal..  So why 4 stars and not 5? We had the soft shell crab roll, in my opinion it didn't stand out to other versions of this particular maki that i've tasted.",

His restaurant here in Vegas did not disappoint in any way. A couple friends and I each ordered the Omakase (tasting menu) for $140 each. There were six dishes, and each was phenomenal. See photos for the courses. The highlights were the toro tartare, surf and turf, and sushi. This meal was definitely worth the price! For a refreshing and unique drink, try the Japanese Mule.

    "text": "I've been to the original Morimoto in Philadelphia and was quite impressed. The Iron Chef has since expanded his empire all across the country, with multiple branches (Napa being one of them) emphasizing ambience and the celebrity factor while falling short on substance. So it's totally my fault for knowing exactly what I was getting into and choosing to come here anyway.  Still, I had a hefty MGM resort dining credit I wanted to use, I was in the MGM that very moment, and I was hangry, which meant that I wasn't up to trekking all the way to other MGM-affiliated resorts in search of better dining options. So I ventured into Morimoto hoping for some simple nigiri sushi, sashimi, and sushi rolls, but after seeing the hefty prices on the menu, I went all out for the omakase. Even though it leans more towards flash than substance, at least it's the most value-conscious choice on the menu.  To start, I received a course of toro tartare, which came served in a plastic scraping board alongside wasabi, nori paste, and sour cream, plus a small helping of sturgeon caviar on the side. All of this came centered around a large bowl of ice, ostensibly to make the whole course look far larger than it actually was and to provide a photo-worthy \"wow\" moment. The actual amount of food was rather small, and I would have appreciated some more bread on which I would have spread the tuna tartare, instead of licking it straight off my scraping tool.  Next was a course of wagyu carpaccio. I could barely discern the flavor of the beef because it was so thinly sliced and because it came doused with sauce. This was followed by a seafood stew which at least packed some nice umami flavor despite being rather petite in size. Then came a nigiri course featuring chutoro, yellowtail, red snapper, clam, uni, and mackerel. The uni was the only selection that packed flavor to it; everything else was rather unmemorable. At least they use real wasabi.  I was feeling a bit underwhelmed by the whole dinner at this point; fortunately, the surf and turf course that came next was more than enough to fill me up, even though the turf was rather tough on the outside despite being cooked medium on the inside. The lobster was quite flavorful and came off the shell easily; although no extraction tool was provided at first, I still felt that I had to ask for one in principle.  On this note, service felt a bit forced and rushed. The servers didn't seem to know much about the dishes beyond perfunctory, superficial descriptions, plus there seemed to be a bit of a bro culture among the staff. I noticed that other customers received a wet towel (something that you'd expect upon sitting down at finer Japanese-themed establishments), yet despite my choosing the omakase, with all its courses, I received none.  The omakase ended in predictable fashion - with some literal fireworks. A \"fiery\" salty caramel tart was exactly that - it was set ablaze before my eyes until I was told to blow it out before it melted completely. Sure made for some Instagram-worthy theatrics.  All in all, if you're looking for an atmospheric dining experience that isn't going to be terribly traditional from a Japanese sense, then this Morimoto branch does the trick. Skip the high-priced a la carte items and settle for the omakase, where at least you're getting good value.",

The steak was really good, however it was really rare for a medium, we had to send it back for them to recook it. The duck fried rice was the best dish of the night, so simple but so delicious. The runny yolk made the dish. A+ for the duck fried rice! My sister got the omakase. Overall it's alright. Nothing I would come back for... except the chocolate ball dessert.

Very pricey though for instance $17 for one piece of tuna sashimi.    I ordered the whole branzini fish with carpaccio for apps.  Can't complain about the food. It's amazing and presentation is great.    Service is also a little bit on the slow side.  Expect to pay a lot of you want your belly filled, I literally went to a burger joint an hour later",

It was opened by Iron Chef Morimoto. This is my first time eating at any of his restaurants and I was super impressed. I love the vibe and ambiance.   We got to try a bit of everything.   Pork Chashu Salad- I loved the pork chashu.   Braised Black Cod-Amazing. My favorite dish of the night.   Seafood toban yaki-this dish had lobster, king crab, mussels, clams in a refreshing light sauce. It was good.    California Rolls-super yummy  Fiery Chocolate Tart-great fire show but you can taste the spiced rum    Overall, LOVE LOVE LOVE! I will be back.",

    "text": "I wasn't even hungry having stuffed my face for 3 days and it still blew my socks off even with very high expectations.  Let's just get right to it, location within MGM and decor is just fine.  If I'm going to pay through the nose, it's gotta be unique, full bodied flavors, and stand out and uber fresh.  Well Morimoto in my view did all that on this busy Tuesday night where the conference for 7-11 owners was going on.  I ordered the chirashi bowl while other friends ordered the laksa, congee w/ 15-hour braised pork, fried rice and two folks ordered their 6-course sample menu.  We were all quite impressed.  Laksa was thick, full bodied curry flavors with good but not great amounts of noodles.  Fried rice was infused with great garlic flavors which means the wok was super hot and fried nicely. The congee and 12-hour braised pork was also again full of flavor, not just the pork but the congee itself.  But for me, I felt lucky ordering the chirashi bowl, for $35, I've not had its equal. Bite sized fish of WIDE assortment and light vinegar flavored rice with shaved seaweed.  Readers, they didn't just put fish on top, it felt like they strategically embedded fish within the rice and thus I felt there was a very generous amounts of fish. Tuna, hamachi, salmon, shrimp, white fish, mackerel, all of which were super fresh. Shrimp and tamago also included. What caught me by surprise was a shiitake mushrooms soaked in some sweetened liquid that added something very new to a chirashi bowl experience. They also made the slices bite sized which made for even more enjoyment. That's more work to prepare the bowl...  I sampled the 6-course and I must say it stood out. Once again the flavors were just on-point and uniquely presented. Nigiri, tuna tartare, seafood stew, dessert, etc.  Two people for $140 for what you got I felt was fair. Again, you're in LV, 5-star hotel and a celebrity chef establishment. Can't say other celebrity chef places can hit the same mark.  We pretty much felt like we were judging Morimoto when he did Iron Chef the flavors were so bold, on point and delicious.  I can't wait to come again, it's gonna hurt the pocketbook but there are few places in Vegas where you pay mightily but you also get amazing flavors and good portions for what you pay.  Top 2 chirashi bowls I've ever had world wide. I'll be back.",

Interesting appetizers with the pork belly being the winner - melt in your mouth good that people who don't like the greasiness of the pork still liked it.  Also very good were wagyu carpaccio, whitefish carpaccio, kama, and taco. The vegetables and Chinese broccoli were also great such that they were loved by the meat lovers.  Kids loved the black cod and surf and turf. The only one I would skip is the snapper curry entree--overly coconut and oddly needed some spice unlike the rest of the meal.  The desserts were interesting with the black forest as most interesting and delicious. Love that you crack the chocolate and oozes out cherry flavored sauce and then you find some marshmallow-like stuff hidden. The kirsch ice cream was very good with the sauce and rich chocolate mousse.  Service can be slow at times so plan for a leisurely meal.",

The menu contains the standard Morimoto fare (modern Japanese/fusion fare), and is essentially a clone of the Napa/NYC locations. The rock shrimp tempura was solid, and the selection of nigiri I ordered was fairly high-quality as well, with fresh cuts although nothing out of the ordinary.  Service was very friendly and attentive, and a wide variety of wines, beers, sakes, and cocktails are on offer as well. However, I did find myself wishing for a greater variety of sushi, and I was somewhat disappointed that omakase was not available. That being said, this place is definitely a decent option if you're looking for decent-quality sushi or upscale Japanese fare.",

    "text": "I visited Morimoto almost exactly a year ago today and felt that the duck, duck goose was a revelatory experience. However, we visited again this year and were disappointed.   Negatives: First of all, we made reservations and were still sat right by the entrance to the kitchen. Then, unfortunately, the duck dish did not live up to expectations in my mind. The gooseberry sauce was haphazardly thrown on the plate, the duck breast skin has been rendered JUST enough, and could've used less of a fat cap. The broth was MAYBE 1/3 of a cup of liquid and probably a full tablespoon of lemongrass (way too much, it was overpowering), whereas last time it was a nicely balanced broth. Finally, the rice was the biggest disappointment of the night. I'd dreamed about that rice off and on for a year.. fluffy, with gooey egg and tasty confit duck, and a fresh pop of scallions. This time the rice was undercooked and over-crisped.. the rich yolk couldn't make up for the bite in the rice, it seemed to lack fragrance that I typically associate with rice dishes and, this is a small detail, but no scallions this time.  Positives: My husband had a large, late lunch and did not want a full dinner, so he was prepared to just order sushi rolls. Last year he got the spicy yellowtail roll, but he wanted something simple this time, and he loved his tuna and salmon rolls. We also got sticky ribs, and while they were fairly sweet, they were definitely tasty. We finished the night by splitting the cheesecake dessert, which came recommended by our waiter and was DELICIOUS.   I'm not sure if I'll go back for anything other than dessert, but I think my husband definitely would.",

The whole fried fish was well worth it's price. The whole fish entree was $39. The service was excellent. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant was nicely decorated and laid out. The most expensive items were the steaks. It will run you about $90. Morimoto is definitely a pricey restaurant. It will cost about $100/person if you don't get steaks. Of course, in a high end restaurant like this one, the alcohol will cost you. We got a bottle of sake, 600ml, and it was $88. Oh yeah, the flaming chocolate ball. It cost $20, but when you see other tables ordering it, you would want one too. I would recommend Morimoto, especially if you are willing to splurge a bit.",

I had the salmon sushi, snapper and the chocolate tart. Everything was made to perfection. I could die a happy woman right now.   I won't spoil it on the amazing and complex flavors of the flawless execution. Just save your money, hide your kids, and come and have the best food of your life.   Oh and hope that you are seated in Christina's section. Probably the best waitress I've ever had too.",

I had sticky ribs which were quite meaty and had a little kick to them and Chinese broccoli. Spouse had a red snapper entree with a curry flavor - the fish was delicious. We also tried fluke sashimi. Our server, Truman, was wonderful. There was a champagne priced at $50,000 so win big!",

It was a really fun time and in hindsight, we probably should have heeded her advice and not gotten another sushi combination, as the portion sizes are generous.

I own a couple of restaurants, all i say, is i wish that guy was working for me. I never had a better server in my life. everything was coming on time, he was very helpful, respectful, with a smile. food was excellent, drinks were solid, and presentation was great. 3 minor things that i feel they can better at are 1) chopsticks are very slippery.I know they look good, but that doesn't matter. 2) even though it's a traditional authentic Japanese place, on specialty rolls they can be a bit more creative , and offer 2-3 rolls that have more creativity and sauces. i know sometimes you cannot taste the fish, but if you give this small option, might be very beneficial 3) the acoustics of the place. all surfaces are hard, and the echo reflects. would be a great idea to spent some $$ and place some soundproofing on ceiling or below the tables....  Overall everything else was perfect. Even our busser Ryan was amazing. Always with a smile, respectful, and very helpful. This place totally worth the $$, and its a 100 times better than Nobu.  Keep up the good work guys. Next time I am in Vegas ill def visit you again Thank you",

We love Morimoto and have tried his cuisine when in Napa Valley, but recently had a wonderful dinner with family and friends at his new location in Las Vegas.    Everyone's food was succulent and dripped with Iron Chef goodness.  We lucked out to be there the same day he was visiting and was providing a Chef's Taste menu.  OMG!!!  Best thing ever with one course after another of out-of-this-world food.  Then they brought dessert with a flaming sphere of chocolate on fire in a brandy sauce.  Yes, it tasted even better than it sounds.  Go, you will enjoy and nothing less than superb with this chef.  Next on the menu is trying his Disney location.  :)",

I remember enjoying the food and restaurant in general so it made sense that I would be back!   APPETIZERS:    My favorites are the Toro Tartare $31 and Whitefish Carpaccio $20.   Both are great starters. If you like the idea of mixing fresh tuna with different flavors for an incredible taste, you'll want to try the Toro Tartare. The dish itself comes in an iced bowl with 2 small, clear slabs - one has the Toro and the other has a set of 6 condiments which include wasabi, sour cream, caviar, nori paste, chives, guac & bubu arare. There's also a cup of soy sauce if needed. Scrape off a piece from the Toro 'canvas' and with your 'brush', mix it with variety of flavors from the other 'canvas' and enjoy. Very fun and delicious concept.    The Whitefish Carpaccio requires less creativity, but the presentation and taste itself is amazing. Just thinking about the thinly, sliced sashimi with hot oil, ginger, and yuzu sauce makes my mouth water. The fish just melts in your mouth! MUST GET.    ENTREES:   Japanese A-5 Wagyu 3oz. $90   Boyfriend got this. To be real with y'all...3oz is NOT ENOUGH. No wonder wagyu is so expensive, you need to savor every bite - which is what he did. I managed to try a sample and it was good but I can't afford to be paying $90 for meat the size of a deck of playing cards. I was more than happy to split my lobster entree with him since he was still hungry.   Whole Roasted Lobster 'epice' $45   I love lobster, it's one of my favorite seafood dishes. Since I couldn't get my lobster pho at District One, I was definitely going to get lobster at Morimoto's. You can't go wrong with lobster. This dish was everything I wanted! A beautiful lobster -split open with delicious lemon creme fraiche sauce and veggies. The sauce added a nice tanginess to the already seasoned lobster. The veggies on the side made the whole lobster dish very balanced and flavorful. I had to get a side of rice to go along to complete my perfect meal. I was super happy and satisfied.     DESSERT:   Fiery Chocolate Tart $20   The star of the night. I got so excited watching the chocolate ball get lit up from the rum that I forgot about getting a picture! (Thank you for screenshots snapchat!) If you're a fan of chocolate, this is a must get dessert. I'm not a chocolate person, but I have to admit this was the perfect mix of light and heavy. I liked the sorbet and marshmallow inside of the ball and the ganache logs on the side were also delicious. You can bet we were on a sugar high for the rest of the night!   TL;DR  Definitely try if you have never been to a Morimoto. Great service, food and presentation. Look forward to a very enjoyable dining experience!",

I felt that my main course had a bit too much sauce, so it was a bit salty. Aside from that, I had no complaints. The service was really good, and I liked the atmosphere. I do want to come back and try is again, though. I feel like I made the incorrect choice in the food I ordered. Perhaps I'll update my review at that time. I'm very glad that Masaharu Morimoto has a restaurant, here in Las Vegas! It was a long time coming.",

Located inside the MGM where we were staying, making moves to this place was totally the right decision as a sushi lover.  I'm not even going to touch on the ambiance as it was gorgeous. Instead I'll move right onto the food.  The menu was massive. I was mostly here for sushi so I didn't have a tough time choosing. That being said, I had to go with the miso cod as well as it is a Morimoto fan favorite. The 10 piece sushi combo with a spicy tuna roll was phenomenal. The star piece was probably the salmon as it literally melts in your mouth. My friends raved about the unagi piece. The spicy tuna roll was to die for. I would order millions if my wallet allowed it.   The miso cod was delectable. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was just the right amount of sweet.   I'm docking a star for the surf and turf dish. This dish was super underwhelming. The steak was almost inedible and at a price of $55, that's unacceptable. But, this was my friends dish, not mine... so I don't really care.   I'll be back!",

The service is amazing, the food was good but not great, it was okay. Some things I likes more and some less, I would just recommend getting their sushi sampler instead. I hunk $140 is pretty strap for this sort of food.  Huge thanks to the management though for getting us a complementary desert, due to our incident for staying at Mandalay Bay resort ( room was not clean). We didn't expect this, because but it was nice.  Overall great ambience, good and interesting experience",

It was either Iron Chef Morimoto, Emeril...BAM, or Celebrity Chef Wolfgang. I am very happy that I chose Morimoto. Our server Prince was a delight. He gave his favorite recommendations and also helped us pick out a wine to match our food. Sushi chef Xu presented multiple sushi dishes to our table and they are works of art....not to mention lip smacking good! If I could rate 10 stars, they would get 11! Sashimi plate: fresh high quality Oyster with uni/foie gras: melts in your mouth (it can use less sauce in my opinioin) Whitefish carpaccio: packed with flavor and comes with a salad. Toro Tartare: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> (Chef Xu even gave us a tutorial on how to eat) And to end the dinner with this chocolate dessert creation.

    "text": "I've alyways been a fan of Morimoto doing his thing on Iron chef and all. This restaurant took a heck of a while to open but it seems all worth while.   Decor and ambiance is the standard casino style. They all have this odd sleek, modern minimalist, steel gray, with super low lighting, blend into the background look to them that I guess plays to being a upscale romantic destination...however very generic imo.   Into the food and service! The menu is expansive as well as expensive. Some things made sense price point wise, like the 57oz (give or take an ounce) tomahawk steak for 170 but other things kept you scratching your head why. Ordered a variety of a la carte sushi and sashimi along with an eel avocado roll and the soft shell crab roll. Sushi and sashimi were all super fresh and well crafted. The rolls were a bit too loosely rolled but flavor components were spot on.   We shared the 16 oz snake farm Rib eye steak and the 48 hour cured and brined double cut pork chop as well. Both cuts of meat were phenomenal and executed beautifully. Pork chop came with a bed of sauteed housemade kimchi and that was super delicious too. Ordered the spicy string beans as a side for more ruffage but sadly they were under seasoned lackluster. The chilled green tea soba noodles had a nice body and chewiness to them too.   Our server was really nice and attentive without being obtrusive and also treated us to a complimentary Japanese style cheesecake for dessert and it was a beautiful way to end the evening for sure! Not like your heavy sense NY style, which I adore, this is more liken to a souffle. Absolutely well done.   I'm completely spoiled living in NYC and having such access to incredible food however I'm happy to know solid places like these are around for me to enjoy in my travels!",

We made reservations ahead of time online on their website, which saved so much time and hassle of trying to get wait and get a table. The hostesses were very nice. When seated our server was also very welcoming and explained to us the dining experience and also went through each page of the menu with us along with their personal recommendations. We ordered a few things and mostly of entrees are pretty much shareable. The ambience of the restaurant is very laid back and the decor was very nice. This restaurant is \"$$$\" for a reason, but it is the real deal and totally worth the experience.   Our ordered consisted: Sticky Ribs, Surf and Turf, Chef's Combination Sashimi and for dessert the Fiery Chocolate Tart! All were top notch choices! My personal favorite were the sticky ribs, so much flavor in each bite and very tender! The bill came out to be $200+ for us both but the experience paired with the fact we only fine dine once in a while it was well worth the price. Morimoto's, thank you for the great experience!",

First impression, loved the design and ambiance set forth by the decor. I remembered when it was Shibuya and I loved how they opened it up and made it one grand restaurant. We were greeted by our hostess and seated right away. We had reservations and they were super busy so side note reservations would be smart especially on the weekends.  We were greeted by our busser who offered us still or sparkling water, then soon we were greeted by our server, Aries. Aries was wonderful. He was friendly, attentive, suggested some great dishes and recommended some very tasty cocktails.   The food was absolutely amazing. The presentation of each dish was even more astounding. We were all in awe of how each dish was explained, presented and best yet tasted!  Appetizers -Blistered shishito peppers -oysters -beef carpaccio -hamachi tacos  Entrees -new york strip steak that was served over a hot pan. The server poured a sauce over it which made it all sizzle.   -buri bop with yellowtail. It was mixed and made at our table in a hot stone pot. The runner described each step as he made it, which was quite cool to see.  - seared snapper with cocunut curry. This was by far my favorite dish, full of flavor. -Tuna pizza -an assortment of sushi -yellowtail Carpaccio definitely different than what I'm used to but in this case different was very good!  Desserts - doughnuts that are serves with vanilla whipped cream filled pipettes  - fiery saltey caramel chocolate tart, GET THIS!! The presentation alone is worth it!   Loved our dining experience here and definitely looking forward to our next visit",

    "text": "If you want to splurge on a dinner, or impress your date, definitely come here.  If your expectation is you will see master chef Morimoto greeting guests you will be disappointed.    Overall though, we enjoyed our experience dining at Morimoto's.    We came during off peak, after new year's but made reservations anyway.  When we arrived, the place was half full so turns out didn't need formal reservations.  For some reason the hostess seated us at a small table right beside the entrance of the restaurant, we politely asked if we could sit inside and enjoy the ambiance of the place.  (not sure why she would do that considering it was half full)    In terms of the decor of the restaurant, it's definitely very pretty and as mentioned before if you want to impress your date this is a go to spot.    In terms of food and drink we tried the following: 2 cocktails, duck rice with egg, sushi combo, pork belly, black cod, and doughnuts and the chocolate fireball for dessert.    In terms of the menu, I believe its seasonal, so I'm sure some items you see on yelp you may not be able to get, but the core items are usually always there.    As for the food and drink: the cocktails we both got weren't anything special (both fruit flavored), next time I would probably pass and just get a beer or soda.  In terms of food, the one we liked the least was the pork belly (kakuni).  The pork belly was dry and bland, you will easily find better pork belly at a popular Chinese restaurant.    On the other hand the duck rice with egg, sushi combo, and black cod were all very good.  In terms of presentation and taste, one of the best I've tasted.  As for dessert, for me I actually liked eating the doughnuts better than the chocolate fireball.  The chocolate fireball of course looks great posting on yelp, but the actual taste is just ice cream and cake.  The doughnut is basically a play on a Chinese doughnut with cream filling.    Overall, for 2 people with drinks and 3 to 4 entrees, you're probably going to run around 150 to 200 easily.   If you're okay with spending that much I would definitely recommend Morimoto's next time you're in sin city.",

With that said, it's just as good as Napa but it is a bit more expensive than the Napa location. A few dollars here and there between some dishes.   Toro Tartare - I love the presentation and it taste great but it's a bit difficult to eat. White fish carpaccio - The hot oil they drizzle on top cooks the fish just a bit. I eat sashimi but still prefer my fish cooked so this is perfect as you get the best of both worlds. Duck Duck Goose is fantastic, especially the fried rice. It's duck cooked four ways. The leg came a bit dry and our server Aries was awesome and offered to bring me another. The second one was perfect and delicious. Braised black cod - was flavorful and moist but I've had better just a few days ago at Nobu.   I asked for a virgin cocktail, they brought me a mango match punch (virgin) it was awesome. One of the best mocktails I've had.   I live in San Francisco and am driving distance to the Napa location but I still would come to this location when I'm in Vegas next time. Fantastic meal.",

    "text": "It may be very hard for me to give 4 or 5 stars to any restaurant in Las Vegas. They all just lack ambience wherever they make up for taste and flavor. The Sushi was not different from what Origami my favorite place sells for half the price. The entrees were tasty. Our server was weird. Kept looking at my friend while asking questions. These are the small nuances that makes one lose their appetite.  Anyway. They get 7 for taste, 4 for service, 6 for flavor, and a 2 for ambience.",

I made sure to book the reservation far in advance since we had such a large party...so if you do as well I'd recommend it.   We sat down and were greeted by a very nice serving staff..she explained that the best way to eat here is family style so that is what we did.   Ordered drinks, highlighted by the Japanese Mule! Very good but very gingery!   We ordered soo much food..pork gyoza, white fish carpaccio, wagyu beef carpaccio, sticky ribs, hamachi tacos for the appetizers! Sashimi, a couple sushi rolls, ribeye steak, black cod, and duck fried rice for the main round! Followed by 2 fiery chocolate tarts and 1 doughnut for desert. It was A LOT of food for us but we finished everything except some of the steak which we took home. Everything we ate was absolutely incredible and the fish was some of the best I've ever tasted!   If you have the money and want some amazing Japanese cuisine..this is a must go! 5 star dining from start to finish!",

    "text": "ok ok ok....this place is gonna get it right now...  we strolled over to Morimoto tonight to check out the spot. I have been walking by this place a lot going to Craftsteak (which we love). I just keep saying \"we should go there and check it out and get some sushi\" and never really acted on that until tonight.  so we get over to Morimoto, check out the menu and at first was a little put off by the prices, but hey lets try it out right? So we get in, get sat down and start to try and decide what to get.   Now usually I would just get a rib eye steak and call it a day, but i wanted to try some things, while looking through the menu I started to realize that this is going to get close to $500 and up for what I wanted to order. How is that possible? Let me dive in.  First, the steaks are like $100 for a \"16oz\" rib eye. They have the Wagyu meat also like everyone else, but they are charging a GRIP for their food. EVERYTHING is priced to the max, 20,000% markup. So before this started to go down, I eye balled the starters and wanted to try the tuna tacos ($21). There is a photo on here that shows them, so i went with that first. Then we also ordered the rock shrimp dish ($24). We waited and talked about the menu with the waiter and he said \"the sashimi was 1 slice of fish per order\"...this is where I checked out. You SERIOUSLY went there. 1 slice that is no longer then a inch maybe 1.5 inches and a qtr inch thick is ranging up to $20 or something? you tripping Morimoto or whoever setting them prices!   So on to the dishes we did order. The rock shrimp came first. It was good in flavor but like...it just reminded me of deep fried, thick battered shrimp you can find at sizzler. Nothing special AT all. The shrimp size was very small, petite at best and maybe less then 1lb of it in the dish. whatever, ate that.  the next dish i ordered were those tuna tacos (based on the photo i saw here which is ULTRA misleading). When I got them and the runner slid them my way, i instantly laughed. The SIZE of the taco was very small portioned. Like, you know how you get a standard street taco and the tortilla is about 5 inches round? This is like 3-3.5 inches round. Folded in half, crunchy. Now the flavor was very good, no doubt about it, but again the portion was ridiculous.  After the tacos were swallowed the waiter was talking with us about other options and we weren't having it. He showed me the meat display which was nice, but still not getting me to come close to order it for the prices they are asking. Then the couple behind us had their food delivered and he told me that was the meat dish, and whatever side dish they ordered and the only thing we can think of and said outloud was \"where is the meat\"? well the guy behind us ordered the 3oz minimum steak I think, i dont know. I got up and looked and there was like 4 slices of meat on his metal dish. And the waiter chatted up the dish is 400 or 450 degrees and you pour the sauce on and it sizzles and cooks a little bit more into the meat or whatever. man no thanks. I'mnot having it.  just asked for the check and left. was going to go over to craftsteak (which is so delicious) but wanted something new so we tried the new Italian spot across from Morimoto and was happy there. portions were good, price was fine (high but not even close to the prices Morimoto is asking) and ill review them later on, i just had to get this off my chest.  so that is why this is getting 1 star. The food quality is eh, ok. The taste is whatever. the water was good, ill give them that. that water filter is superb. Very clear and good tasting. However, there is just no way it is reasonable in the slightest to put these prices on the menu. Yea they are getting it, and maybe the people eating there just have so much money they dont care, or they won some hands at the blackjack table or a few pots on the slot machine. whatever the case may be, just because your in Vegas doesn't mean you have to price gauge your patrons. But again, if there are people out there willing to pay these prices then by all means keep ripping. But not going to get that from me (even if its free).  Rib Eye steak for $98-$100? And right next door the same steak with a delicious flavor for half that price almost, well that is where i will go! And the Italian spot across the way Rib Eye was like $50 or $60 and was EXCELLENT.  If the starting dishes we got were great we might have went further but I just wasn't feeling it.",

I've travelled a bunch and sushi is my global favorite, especially classical fish.  I sat at sushi bar, was not allowed to interact with chiefs.  Had to order all thru waiter.   Asked for some type of OMAKASE, was told to order $50 chef selection.  I got talked out of trying to order my own.  I was not able to find out what beautiful fish was recommended or find out what the chiefs liked.  What I got was what you could get anywhere for $25.  The roll was a simple chopped tuna with mayo.  Seriously this upset me more than anything.  Here I am at a high end restaurant and I get a chopped tuna roll with mayo?.!?!  Only got some of the basic and simple fish selections.  Heck I Did not get some of the great taco, octopus that was in the case in front of me.   Miso soup was good but for one person and only one drink I walked out of there for over $100  And really was sad  I had a better time and food at the sushi rotation convoying joint over in the Chinese areas two nights ago.  Now I did see others with wonderful looking meals.   Thus IMHO go there for Japanese fusion but stay away from their sushi.  Yet if in Philly be sure to hit them uo",

We came here for team dinner and ordered 1 sashimi and 1 sushi boats (about 150 each) and several appetizers.  The fish was great, they were fresh and of very high quality. Most melted in the mouth with great texture. However it wasn't too much better than other expensive sushi places (that are cheaper).   The fried rice was great, tempura was average. The deserts were phenomenal though, the icecream in a chocolate ball had great presentation and taste.",

I also had a cucumber cocktail but it was sickeningly sweet. Maybe opt for a glass of wine.   Finally, service was not attentive at the sushi bar. It was difficult to get my water refilled. Soy sauce was not in reach. They didn't check in much and it took a while to get my check, etc. I also noted there were like 7 sushi chefs standing and watching the crowd but not really engaging at all with the sushi bar customers despite having long periods of downtime in their work. Maybe that's a cultural thing or a fancy restaurant thing? I'm used to having more basic interaction even from busy sushi chefs (e.g eye contact, hello, how is your meal). Food for thought for management :)",

Our server, I think his name was Matthew (according to our receipt), was nice but seemed a little robotic and not personable, and our water was never refilled until we got our check. We had empty cups for a long time. But onto the food.  -Toro tartare: delicious and fresh! It was fun scooping up the toro and trying the different toppings.  -wagyu beef carpaccio: the best dish of the night! We really wanted to order more of this. It's so delicious l, you must get this.  -surf & turf: steak cooked perfectly medium rare with broccolini, onion, and mushroom. Hamachi was fresh and came with a little squeeze dropper you can use to add some chili oil.  -braised black cod: melts in your mouth and sauce was delicious! It's good to note that it's just the fish by itself so I'd order something to go along with it. Which is why we ordered duck fried rice.  -duck fried rice: yummy fried rice with a fried egg on top. Yolk was runny, just the way we like it!  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and would like to come back again to try other dishes the next time we are in town.",

As with anything in Las Vegas it is going to be expensive. You should come here with a fat wallet and a set my empty stomach but what you will eat will be fantastic!   You must get their homemade donuts for dessert. The little yellow balls that you see on top of these round cinnamon delicious pieces of flour are actually filled with cream custard. You squeeze them into the cinnamon deliciousness to make them an amazing dessert!!  I went here for dinner with four Co workers. Two of them had two drinks and two of us had none. Our bill was $480. This is not your average sushi place with average price remember you are in Las Vegas!  All in all it was a great experience but there has to be more reasonable sushi restaurants in Las Vegas with equal or better fish quality. You're paying for the name!",

My BF and I didn't have a reservation when we arrived but we were seated immediately upon arrival at the sushi bar as they had just opened for dinner. The restaurant filled up quickly shortly after. It was quite the entertainment watching the skilled sushi-chefs prepare not only our dinner but everyone else's. The food here is treated like an art and I appreciate their attention to detail as their food not only looks amazing but also tastes phenomenal.

The tartar itself was super fatty and melted in your mouth. I loved how it came with all the different sauces and toppings on the side so you could customize each bite.   My boyfriend and I also shared the sushi combo for two. It came with 2 sushi rolls and lots of nigiri. Usually I would prefer sashimi over nigiri because I'm not a huge fan of rice. But this rice was cooked perfectly and paired perfectly with the fresh fish. Definitely the best quality sushi I've ever had.",

The hype is real and even though I never watched Iron Chef I believe there is some True culinary skill behind the food at Morimoto (not to mention the super fresh sushi)!  We ordered the omakase for our first night here and were so impressed we came back the night after for the A5 Japanese Waygu + 17 year old Nikka whiskey, followed by the 30 year old sake for dessert. DE-LI-CIOUS. Super pricey but actually worth the money we forked over!  I will 100% be back again to Morimoto.",

Restaurant is located inside MGM hotel towards the back. The restaurant is super modern and sophisticated. I love the decor and the huge sushi bar area. The staffs were welcoming and very friendly! We arrive 20 mins late to dinner due to Vegas traffic, but hostess quickly checked us in and sat us down. The place was pretty pack and it was a good mix of different people. Our waiter was beyond awesome! He helped us with the menu and explained to us the chef's special.   Food was so bomb!!! As bomb as Napa location! We order sushi rolls, black cod, crispy fish, laksa noodle, oyster foie gras, rice bowl bimbibop version. Hands down the best dish here is the black cod! It is always delicious no matter which location. It's the MUST order dish when eating at Morimoto!!! It's well seasoned and extremely buttery....I mean melt in your mouth buttery with eyes roll back and everything. Lol My second favorite is the crispy whole fish. The batter the fish is fried in is light, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. The fish itself is super fresh with no fishy smell and just delicious....makes me drool just thinking about it! The sweet/sour papaya salad accompanying the crispy fish adds the perfect balance of flavor! The flavors works so well together. The rice dish came raw in a very hot stone pot which they cook the fish, egg, and rice right in front of you. What an awesome show! The sizzling of the fish definitely adds to the effect. Rice and fish was cooked perfectly. Although it was good it didn't come close to being compared to the two fish we had. The fishes were the show stopper. Oh, and if you are craving for some noodle soup just do yourself a favor and order the laksa noodle! So satisfying!!! It has a very rich umami broth! The noodles were cooked al dente and had the perfect chew. I can definitely eat a huge bowl all by myself. The cooked oysters are great! I'm not a huge oyster fan, but since it's cooked and topped with foie gras believe me you'll never know you're actually eating oysters. Each dish ordered was just as perfect as the last. It didn't matter which location the food and service stayed consistent at both places. If I ever do win big  in sin city this has to be one of the place I'll be ordering everything on the menu!",

However, a manager-liked staff realized and came to us immediately to compensate the awkward situation.  8oz filet absolutely ruled. It was very juicy and soft. They provided us with a special sauce and the steak was already cut.  Oyster foie gras is a creative course. If you are a \"must try\" person, try this one.  I'm not a dessert fan, but Pana cotta won my favor. The not-too-sweet base dessert came with sour and extremely sweet chocolate sorbets on the side.",

The atmosphere here is contemporary chic with modern Asian flare. We loved it.  It wasn't too loud but also wasn't as quiet as a library.

Lucky for us we were able to get a table at the lounge on a busy night.  Steve who was the bartender that night gave us great suggestions on some appetizers and sake we might enjoy.  We ended up having the sticky ribs and the buribop.  Also we got a blue bottle of sake (can't remember the name).  The food was delicious!  The sake hit the spot too.  The staff gave a thorough explanation and history of all the food and drinks that we ordered.  Later on we ordered some sushi which included mackerel and tuna. Some of the freshest fish I have ate here in Vegas.  We were visited by two different managers during our time.  Overall I was very impressed with the food and service.  I'll definitely be back in the future for a more planned out and formal dinner.",

I went with a party of four and we let the waiter tailor our meal for us spending about $200 before tax and tip. The best part of our meal, food wise was the sashimi with a close second being an oyster dish.  I know a yelp review is more helpful if you actually include the names of the dishes but we ate so much and my memory is not all that good especially after a few beers.  Our server Ed was friendly and made very good food selections.  The flaming chocolate dessert was excellent.  About an hour into our three hour dinner Ed pointed out that Chef Morimoto was in the restaurant that evening.  This made my wife very happy.  After multiple attempts she succeeded in getting us a group picture with Chef Morimoto. That was the highlight of our visit to this wonderful restaurant.",

I had the duck duck goose as my entree and it was so good! The duck leg was juicy and tender, definitely my favorite part of the entree. For dessert, I had the coconut mango. The charcoal meringue was the highlight of this dish for me, so sweet and airy yet earthy.",

My husband and I made a reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival. The decor in this place is cool and modern. Our waiter was extremely helpful in recommending dishes, and we basically went with whatever he recommended. I'd venture to say he is one of the best waiters I have ever had! We have a pork belly that blew our minds. Actual words spoken as I ate the pork belly: \"I would want this to be my last meal whenever I die.\" Yup, that good. We also had a lovely seafood platter with all kinds of good stuff. Dessert topped off our great meal with a flaming chocolate sphere! Woo! I want to come back to this place as soon as possible!

    "text": "Was pleasantly surprised at Morimoto by both the cuisine and the management.    We had three starters:   1)Tuna Pizza  - A must have, thin crust with tuna and toppings.  Expected it to be spicier with the halepenos but it was well balanced and sung in your mouth. 2) Sticky Ribs, another must have, fall off the bone, sweet glaze plays on your tongue.  3) Hamachi Tacos, good but not a standout, go with the first two.  Three mains: 1) Seared Snapper - Excellent, creamy smooth curry with bananas and rice.  Fish expertly done and all the flavours worked amazingly. 2)Duck Duck Goose -  More like 4 duck dishes,  1 Duck Fried Rice (what you would expect), 2 duck meatball soup - Just ok  3 Confit duck leg - Very good but again typical, and  4 Duck Breast (perfectly done, with a sweet savory gooseberry sauce, the best of the Duck dishes)  They should make the breast a dish by itself and throw in some fois gras. 3) Pork ishi Yaki Bop -  This was a let down for us.  The pork was mainly the fat of the belly so its consistancy was very soft lacking pork flavour. Presentation was neat but the wow factor stopped there.   Dessert:   1)Fiery Salty Caramel Chocolate Tarte -  Dinner then a show, what else can you ask for ?  Melted beautifully.  The marshmallow inside was smooth and creamy not sticky at all.  Enough for two people.  Management: The manager Jim went out of his way to insure our experience at Morimoto ended on a positive note.  He took notice that we did not enjoy the Ishi Bop so he promptly made things right by exceeding our expectations.  He showed great awareness of his diners and their experience.  Because of Jim we left on a high note and will be sure to return.    Overall:  Great management, great food, good portion size, and a nice ambiance.  Morimoto is a must visit.  A+",

The bright spots were his sashimi appetizer that came in small little stacks with different sauces - this is a must try. Also, miso soup, is miso soup - but at Morimoto's it was outstanding (please note that it is big enough for two people). The Miso Black Cod was good, and if you haven't had it before I would recommend, but Nobu still wins on the cod. The egg on the Duck fried rice, to die for, but the rice itself - long grain - was just so/so. MUST TRY the donuts!   The service was impeccable!  I do want to go back and try their tepanyaki though - the menu looked interesting.",

The large $200 chefs choice Sushi was presented well but for that much money it was lack luster at best. The sauce they put on the whole fried fish was disgusting! And trying to get a chicken dish for my mother-in-law with out being all curry sauced up proved to cause us to be served a mediocre chicken and potatoes dish. The medallion potatoes were dry and flavorless. We didn't eat them, nor did we eat much of the chicken. Oh and the specialty cocktail tasted horrible, we didn't drink it either.  For such an upscale restaurant you'd think they would notice what we didn't eat or drink... nope!",

The two things I wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend would be the spicy green beans and angry chicken. They were on the salty side so not for everyone at the table but I still liked them. But the dishes others in my party ordered were admittedly better. Apple sauce pork, bimbambop with egg, duck fried rice with egg, and the oyster seafood dish.  For dessert, we had the fiery chocolate tart and cheesecake souffle with matcha green tea to drink. I'd recommend the chocolate tart over the souffle but I enjoyed both. The matcha tea was a great compliment.",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to go dine at Morimoto this past weekend. He is one of my favorite Iron chefs and I still remember getting to dine at Nobu in New York City and he was the head chef at that time. The sushi was out of this world as were the hot plates. This is why I gave this restaurant four stars and not five. It was good, but it missed the greatness that this incredible iron chef is known for. We started by ordering the Wagyu beef carpaccio as an appetizer and it was delicious. We also ordered the Himezen sake, a mildly sweet sake, that was really good. We went on to sushi where we ordered the yellowtail and scallion roll, the Toro and scallion roll, and the shrimp tempura roll. I did ask that any spicy sauce be kept off of the shrimp tempura roll. The shrimp tempura roll was yummy but it was not phenomenal like other places on the strip and off the strip where I have had it at. The yellowtail scallion roll was delicious but I still have had better on the strip. The Toro and scallion roll was on the smaller side but incredibly good. For entrees, we ordered the black cod which was absolutely delicious and melted in your mouth. We also ordered the yellowtail with rice Korean like dish that comes in a very hot pot and it was good, but I was not blown away by it. We found the rice to be quite bland. For dessert, we shared a mango and coconut dessert that came with the mango mousse and coconut mousse with a green tea ice cream on top and was very good. The price for all of this was very reasonable and we were impressed by the fact that the prices were not exorbitant. They were not cheap but they were also reasonable. The restaurant itself is beautiful, open and modern, and the service is very friendly. I have had better sushi at other places, which surprises me. The hot plates had one major winner and one that was just OK.  As locals, we talked about the fact the parking for 2 1/2 hours of dining cost seven dollars, which for Las Vegas, is new and a lot. We questioned if it is worth paying this money again to come eat at this restaurant, and we all agreed that the answer was no, because there are places that are phenomenal on and off the strip that are equally, if not way better, with free parking. Overall though, the food here was very good.",

    "text": "This is our third visit to Morimoto. We were so happy with the dinners we'd eaten there previously. What happened to your restaurant, Morimoto-san? When we made our reservation (well in advance) the host asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. Yes! When a fine dining restaurant asks about a special occasion, that means that it is acknowledged in some way - complimentary drinks, a dessert, sometimes even a small gift. We chose a restaurant like Morimoto for a special occasion just for this reason. Guess what we got? Bupkis. The host said \"Happy Birthday\" as we checked in and that was it. No other acknowledgement or special service. Our advance reservation awarded us a table just a few feet away from the restroom entrance. We had a floor show all evening of people using the facilities, including one green-faced young woman running to the bathroom with her hand clapped over her mouth - sushi novice? We'll never know.  The food was a mixed bag. We started off with wonderful appetizers - the tuna pizza and the Omakase tuna tartare were both delicious. It went downhill from there, with overcooked lobster, less than fresh sushi, and worst off all, a dried up, large lump of fake wasabi that wasn't even blended properly. If they had given us the tiniest amount of freshly ground wasabi, what a difference that would have made! This faux wasabi lump was an insult to the meal and to us.  Our server was personable enough, but there was minimal service throughout the meal, definitely not what you'd expect from a $$$ restaurant. Our server did one check-back after the appetizers were served, and then he chatted us up a bit before bringing the check. Since there were no warm towels offered, we had to use our own hand wipes, and the wrappers were never cleared from the table. Once of the servers spilled a little tea on the table - that was never wiped up. So many details that make a huge difference in the dining experience.",

I think the crowds come and go here, which is nice, compared to some of the other hot spots in Vegas that seem to always be busy.  We got the surf and turf ($48) and the seafood toban yaki ($42). The surf and turf presentation was beautiful, but it could have been better. Steak was a bit cold. But the seafood toban yaki... so, so good. You get a lobster tail, claw, and another piece, clams, mussels, shrimp, scallop, and an assortment of vegetables. All this to say, they don't skimp for the price. In my opinion, though, you need a side of rice or it gets too salty. It's reminiscent of a cioppino, but with an Asian twist. Would come back for the toban yaki any day.   Reason for 4 stars is that they definitely need more servers. Either they're slow, or they're in charge of too many tables. Our server came around only once over the course of our meal, and we had to order part of our meal with a busser. Good experience overall!",

The hostess greet us right away and wished my sister Happy Birthday since there is a note that we celebrate my sister birthday that night.  New restaurant inside MGM Grand, it used to be Shibuya. It has a nice remodeled, nice atmosphere and decor.  We got Chef's tasting menu, the Omakase for $140/person. It is 6 course menu. Started with Toro Tartar, second course was Wagyu beef carpaccio, third course was seafood fondue( fish balls, shrimp, muscle, vegi and home made soba) come with tomato and cheese sauce. Fourth course was sushi combo, fifth course was Surf and Turf( beef tenderloin and lobster tail), last course was chocolate fire ball.  Our favorite was the Toro tartare, the sushi combo was so fresh and delicious, the surf and turf was awesome as well. I'm not too crazy for the fondue or the dessert course. Not too impress on the beef carpaccio, saw a lot of oil on the plate since the beef had been seared with garlic oil.  It was a great experience and I will come back to try other dished on the menu.",

For the whole time we sat there, the wait staff took our drink and kitchen orders in a very timely manner. However, the sushi chefs was another story. At no time did they bother to speak with us to greet us and ask what we would like. Big turn-off and buzz kill!  The nigiri sushi was well over priced as well. Ranging from $9 to 16 per order and that is for one piece not two.  A Rainbow Roll order will set you back a whopping $35.  I ordered the Black Cod entree from the menu and it was horrible. Black cod by itself is a  very flavorful fish. The kitchen managed to ruin this dish by completely smothering it with teriyaki sauce.  Other than that, the decor was beautiful!  I would not recommend this restaurant to any one at any level. There are so many other Japanese restaurants in Las Vegas that offer a much better dining experience.",

Seafood 'Toban Yaki'- would describe this as a Japanese ciopino, very good \"soup\" base that had a kick, very flavorful, with all seafood cooked just right. 6.) Morimoto-style Chirashi- honestly, this was my favorite dish as I feel chirashi is second to an omakase that displays the chef's different cuts of fish; in the bowl was salmon, tuna, toro, hamachi, shitake mushroom, and cubed steamed egg, ginger, and inari 7.) Fiery Chocolate Tart- this chocolate ball smore-like dessert has a fantastic display when it ia melted with the alcohol that is set on fire; the chcolate sorbet inside is a perfect combo with the marshmallow and raspberries. 8.) Mango Pudding- creamy fruitty pudding accompanied by coconut green tea sorbet, and these coconut cakes that were the bomb 9.) Souffle Cheesecake- while this was good, I believe it's like any other Japanese cheesecake, the little sauce dots are probably what set thia dessert apart from other Japanese cheesecakes  Overall, the restaurant was fantastic.  The sushi chefs are skilled in how they cut.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  When we sat down, it was great that they addressed me  by name, gave us all hot towels go clean out hands.  They also asked if they could wipe down the table after the main course, which I liked because I'm somewhat a clean freak and had already somewhat started wiping at my eating area.  We did ask one of the wait staff if Morimoto himself comes in, and unfortunately we missed him by two days!  We were told he stops in once a month!  Would be awesome if we could have seen him, but it's certainly great to know that he checks in at this restaurant from time to time.  Again, shoutout to our awesome server Ed. He did a fantastic job with taking care of us and making sure we had everything we needed.",

The layout is modern and open style with a sushi bar, the service was also quite good. Some of our favorite dishes were the rock shrimp - two different sauces both great. The black cod was also delicious with a miso glaze; practically melted in your mouth. They also have fantastic desserts- one is a chocolate ganache with a fiery spiced rum presentation. Overall food had great flavors and a variety of textures as well as looking great and modern.",

We were told we could only sit in the Hibachi section but as long as 2 of us ordered it that was fine as all the other tables (which the MAJORITY of them) were for reservations.    While the place is attractive, the service is another thing - snooty.   Attentive, but snooty.  The only person who was pleasant & great to talk to was the hibatchi chef.  While perusing the menu, I asked for a glass of the house Cabernet.  In my world & everywhere else I go, house is the code word for \"least expensive Cabernet on the wine list\".   NOT HERE.    We decided to leave as we found the hibatchi menu to be outrageous - it's ala carte!   Vegetables - $12, noodles - $12 & the steak for the hibachi - forget it.   I get the bill for the wine & they charged me $38!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yeah - I paid it & hightailed it out of there taking the glass with me - after all - I did pay for it.  What a turnoff - a place charging outrageous prices for what I am sure is mediocre food.   Go next store to Craftsteak.",

Service was impeccable, everyone was working as a team and we made sure to let them know. As for the food, for the price point, yes, I understand it's family style, but for a family of possibly 2. If your expecting to be full after ordering 3 or 4 dishes, you may want to pick up a Pinks Hotdog on your way out of Planet Hollywood. What had to be the worse entree, where we couldn't help it, but to actually have to complain because it was so bad,  The Angry Chicken, wasn't the only thing angry at our table, 4 women who thought this was chicken with absolutely no flavor at all. The waiter was kind of enough to remove it off our bill, but by the time we were done, we really weren't satisfied. There's so many Asian restaurants to choose from in Vegas, next time I'll stick to my favorite, Haakasan.",

We started off with cocktails-my bf had the walnut Manhattan and I had some mango&matcha creation...both were good!  For apps we did the foie gras/uni oysters and a few pieces of fatty tuna sashimi.  The sashimi was wonderful, but the oysters fell short.  The taste was just too fishy for us.  For entrees, I had the Hamachi bop and my bf had the duck duck goose.  My Hamachi bob was amazing and I would highly recommend.  My bf enjoyed the duck duck goose very much, it was cool so see it prepared in so many different ways.  Well done Morimoto!",

I had the 30$ toro, 15$ clam miso and 45$ sushi.  Toro was amazing. Great presentation, great taste, probably a bit overpriced but still good.  The calm miso soup was big, like a real soup bowl. The clams where nice but the broth way too salty. Worth $15? More like 7.  The sushi. The fish was fresh and good quality but It lacked creativity in fish assortment, it was very boring. The tuna roll that came with it was kinda meh and boring too. The portion was also huge, mind you I got the smallest portion and I could only eat half. I would prefer less of it but better.   So was it like bad? No, it was good. Was it worth 120$? I spent half the money in new york for better sushi, so I can't say it was.",

We love the sushi at the other locations but not here in Las Vegas. Yes, it's fresh but the quality of sushi is so much better at other Morimotos. The sushi in Las Vegas location feels like those from supermarket. Huge rice and thin fish. No... This should not be the sushi from Morimoto. I will rather save my money and go to his other location or somewhere else.",

They have a variety of meats and seafood to try if you are at the grill. I enjoyed all of them. The filet was lovely. They also have a number of beers named after Morimoto produced by Rogue.

They hostess was very accommodating and was able to squeeze us in an hour before close.    The menu is extensive and it's easy to get lost in the selection the selection process.  (A side note:  for those who are budget conscious, they have reasonable prices for hand rolls and sashimi, so you can still enjoy the good food without breaking the bank.).   Our server was very helpful in helping us make our selection.   We decided to go with the Omakaze and order a few apps to share.    The Tartar was brilliant.  The presentation itself is like a canvas, and the taste was like a work of art.   The Wagyu carpaccio was a nice refreshing dish, nice flavors to follow the tartar.    The tacos were made from hard tortilla shells and very good, not great.  I found the avocados to be the overpowering taste.  The Bisque was divine, presentation and the open  flame kept the bisque hot and flavorful.  Paired with the shrimp, it was phenomenal.   I recommend you let the dish simmer a bit so it's a little hot.    The Kappani congee (maybe wrong name) was very delicious. If you like traditional pork hocks and fatty portions, this is a must try.   My wife didn't like this as much as she found the flavors too overpowering, but I loved it.   The sushi dish was fresh and nice.  But Nothing that stands out too much.    The surf and turf as the entree just falls short of being great.   The lobster was grilled to perfection and the taste was very very good.   The Japanese steak (A5) I believe, was full of flavors, but done just a tad bit more than I would like.  (I prefer a little blood on my steaks). Otherwise it would have been perfect.    Lastly, the dark chocolate desert was something else.   The presentation with the open flame melting the chocolate ball brought out a smile to my inner pyromaniac.  Overall, a great dish to cap off the evening.    Would I come back in the future?   Probably...   Las Vegas has a lot of options especially for fine dining.  So to earn a repeat to me personally, is a huge feat.  Morimoto definitely deserves a spot as a \"need to try\" restaurant.  The signature dishes will make you want to come back for more....     5 for presentation and ambience  5 for staff  4.5 for food.",

Our server Matt was okay, but he could have been more professional/formal, and attentive. Maybe some profiling was involved because we were a young group, and not dressed to the nines.   The Foie Gras Uni Oyster app was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. This was my favorite dish of the night. Pass on the Gyoza app altogether. I have had better dumplings from the grocery store. The Surf and Turf entree was good, but not great. The hamachi was super fresh, which I did appreciate, and the flavors all blended very well together. The wagyu was overcooked, and left much to be desired. I ordered my steak medium rare, but received it medium well-- what a waste of a quality piece of meat. TRAGIC! The Coconut Mango dessert was delicious, but nothing to write home about.   Overall, Morimoto Las Vegas was nice to try, but I would not go out of my way to go here again. Next time, I am going to stick with the sushi and seafood dishes. If you want a real foodie dining experience, walk across the hall to Joel Robuchon.",

Although expensive, we left feeling completely satisfied with everything that was brought out to us. We thought the tuna pizza and tuna tacos were going to be the same tasting dish but they had 2 different flavor combinations which was surprising. Sake selection is delicious. Sashimi platter was fresh and the beautiful work of the chefs really shines through. Highly recommend ordering dessert even if you don't like sweets. The cheesecake was light, not overly sweet and the sorbet had bold flavors one note leaving the next. I'd like to see anyone who's not impressed with this place do a better job.",

What sets this place apart with harmony of staff working in perfect execution to make sure things gets done in timely and perfect manner.    our party was under time crunch and Matt our server choreographed perfectly for us to get the main meal to arrive on time and also arranged to have our drinks and other items to arrive on time for us to enjoy and savor the flavors and creations of Morimoto's sushi chefs and also people working in the back.  We will definitely come back and try other specialties.",

    "text": "My wife, Chamnan, and I were in Vegas for an early celebration of our 13th Wedding Anniversary and booked a table at Morimoto Las Vegas. I had read the reviews on Yelp, seeing the responses from \"Jeff, Owner\" but nothing prepared me for what was about to happen. Jeff, who is in fact the Assistant Manager, welcomed us. My wife mentioned to the hostess being a bit chilly, having left her sweater in our MGM Grand room. Jeff brought a beautiful black pashmina which he delicately placed on my wife's shoulders. From there it was the most memorable dinner we have ever had as we left almost all decisions to Jeff with only instructions to surprise us. Mari, our server who is originally from the Philippines, was fabulous and indefatigably professional. To begin, Jeff sent a tuna pizza (our own description) and a beef carpaccio (both were out of this world), we then went with a combination sushi (outstanding) and the pork chop (delicious). Seeing that we had gone with the sushi, Jeff got us hot AND cold sake to enjoy with the sushi (we had never had sushi with either as we are not big on alcohol, but it certainly washed down the sushi beautifully) and finished off the meal with a fiery chocolate ball filled with ice cream with Happy Anniversary printed on an oval piece of chocolate (sublime) and two flutes of champagne. We had that oval chocolate packed as a memento for our four little ones back home (in Los Angeles) who promptly carved it up! Our experience with Morimoto Las Vegas was so above and beyond delightful, thanks to the kitchen staff, the dining room staff, our server Mari, and most of all Jeff, that I do not think we can compare it to any other dining experience we have ever had. It was like walking into the restaurant of a personal friend whose only goal was to make us happy. Jeff sent us home with two autographed menus by Morimoto himself. We took pictures with Jeff and even exchanged business cards (who does this?). Thank you, Jeff (I know you're reading this!), for the most amazing Wedding Anniversary dinner my wife and I have ever had. What an amazing and unforgettable experience you created for us and for every guest fortunate enough to come across your path!!!",

Ended up starting off with the tuna pizza, sticky ribs, gyoza and oyster fois gras. For our entree, we ordered the tomahawk rib eye, hamachi fried rice and duck duck goose. For dessert, we shared the smores, sweet sushi and cheesecake. For drinks, we shared several bottles of unfiltered sake.   Everything was delicious but I highly recommend the sticky ribs, hamachi fried rice and the cheesecake.   Kudos to the female manager on shift that was very attentive and ensured we had no issues. Well done.    Will be coming back in the near future.",

Our waiter clearly articulated how most people navigated the menu. We had a wagyu beef carpaccio to start things off (delicious). Then a sashimi combination, sushi combination, uni, and a seared wagyu sushi. We had other dishes, but I don't remember anything we had that didn't make us smile.  Side note: the beef cuts they had on display (elevated glass box in the middle of the restaurant) looked divine, but we were there for sushi mainly :P   Hands down, the best quality sushi I think I've had. The price is what you would expect for an Iron Chef restaurant in Vegas, but since it was our first wedding anniversary (a special occasion), we absolutely felt the dining experience was exceptional.",

I personally enjoyed the wagyu carpaccio and the favorite of the table was the foie gras uni oysters!! Definitely recommend the oysters.   Service was great, our server was exceptional at upselling their dishes but what upset us was that he recommended some plates to us that were just subpar and unimpressive.   The flaming dessert chocolate ball was also a disappointment. The total bill was about $1,800 for 6 people, not sure if this was including tip or not, but def not worth the price.",

I remember things like yellowtail and spicy tuna and kobe beef and sea bass and fish taco's and more.  And the sake was the best I have ever had (Watari Bune, Junmai Ginjo 55).  The regional director of operations (Shik) and the restaurant GM (Jim) both stopped by often to make sure my meal and service was impeccable.  I had been to Morimoto in Maui this past New Year's Eve.  It was not an experience commensurate with the Morimoto reputation.  I spent a boatload of money.  After the experience I sent them an email explaining what happened.  They couldn't have been more sincere in trying to make my next Morimoto experience amazing.  It was!",

    "text": "I'm not one who would dine in these types of restaurants but chef morimoto is an iron chef after all and I love sushi.  We had food credit from our stay at the signature and I knew I'd want to use it here.  Ordered the whole fried fish (branzino) deboned, chirashi rice, negihamachi roll, and Chinese broccoli.  The whole fish with a slightly sweet sauce garnished with a few pieces of soft tofu - it was good, not amazing.  Chirashi was really good.  I was expecting a tiny bowl of rice with maybe a few tiny pieces of fish but it felt like there was at lease 20 pieces of sashimi.  The negihamachi roll was good.  The broccoli was ok.  If I ever come back if definitely get the chirashi.  Our server recommended the cheesecake souffle.  It took over 15 minutes for it to come but I was ok with it although my coffee was getting cold.  He later comped the dessert because he felt bad for the delay.  Even though we didn't complain or even asked about it.  The dessert was good.  I'd try the chocolate tart next time.  Service was great.",

Very expensive, but that was expected...The waitress was nice, but borderline pushy as she seemed to push drinks on us throughout the dinner.  Sorry to go on a rant here,but I need to..I do wish Vegas fine dining places had dress codes. Nothing worse than dressing up to celebrate a special occasion, only to have 2 buzzed,unkempt sloths seated next to you. I made reservations for us days before and was informed only a 5pm time was available -for the entire evening.That wasn't a problem it was Friday night..... We were seated beside another nice couple. The tables were fairly close, a pet peeve of mine,especially if paying major $ on an intimate dinner... But I dind't expect any issues given the situation.... That couple finished quickly and they sat 2 guys. They had just come from the MGM pool and were in shorts, sandals and baseball hats. They clearly had been drinking .   The first thing they said was \"smells fucking great in here\". That was just what we wanted at the summit and last 2 courses of our meal.    This isn't so much a problem of this restaurant specifically, but if they are going to take $460 of my money, and, challenge me to get seating, they better have some standards . They can sit in the damn lounge. If they were seated beside us prior I would have left....    This only encourages eating at home and saving one's money sometimes. Vegas understandably has plenty of party people and thats expected,to a point, but even night clubs have dress standards .... Too bad the mob didn't still run things .",

I began the night with a Morimotoni which is sake and cucumber infused vodka, very refreshing. The menu is very unique with a wide variety of foods which are meant to share. We started with the ahi tacos, can't go wrong with those, they come with three, but they allowed us to add one so we would not fight over the last one. Next we had the pork belly, it's so rich and tender. The meat melts in your mouth and it's just full of flavor.  Next up we tried the duck duck goose. I only wish my attempts at cooking duck looked like this. The duck leg was so tender and cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection. The fried rice with egg reminded me of my favorite breakfasts back on Oahu. Than we shared a shrimp tempura roll. I love that they didn't make it gigantic size. We ended with the salted caramel dessert which was so much fun to watch. I wish I had more time there because there were so many more things I wanted to try on the menu and the service and atmosphere are also both fantastic.",

At $140 per person, we thought we would be getting something special.  The chef's choice.  It was more like a factory.  Things were elegantly plated and it was beautiful.  The courses were okay but some misses too.  There was a fondue that was well below our expectations.  No flavor. My entree ribeye and lobster was disappointing as well.  The ribeye was so chewy and it was prepared medium rare.  No amuse bouche.  It honestly seemed like the dishes were pre-fixed meaning that we could come again next month and get the same exact thing.  Not a True omakase.  I expected way more.  We went to Yellowtail (Bellagio), the next night and that was much more satisfying.  Although we did not get the omakase there.",

Morimoto, the iron chef, is no exception.  He is the iron chef after all and opened not too long ago at the MGM Grand, this was a must try.    We had reservations at 7:45pm and we weren't seated until 8:10pm.  Uh oh, this is not a good sign.  However, the manager was very apologetic and gave us a round of drinks on the house for our inconvenience.  That was very classy.  Being that this is such a high end place, expectations for service and food were high.    The food did not disappoint.  The fish is what is to get here.  We had sashimi and sushi, all of which were excellent and fresh.  O-toro and chu-toro were my faves.  The waiter offered a selection menu that they can craft for the table but we preferred to build our own.  My favorite was the cheesecake souffle dessert.  Yum!  While the fancy chocolate ball lit on fire has the wow factor, the cheesecake souffle was light and moist without the density of the usual cheesecake.  I wanted to lick the plate.  This place is worth a try given although you better get your casino winnings ready for the bill!",

Also tried the basmati rice with duck and egg on the side, but that was underseasoned. Had morimoto's sake from his own label and it was really good, smooth. Presentation was neat with the carafe in an ice bowl. Now, the highlight: their flaming chocolate marshmallow ball. This desert plate is massive and probably good for 2-3 people. Indulgent.  The restaurant itself is new to Vegas and is on the side of the hallway in MGM. On a Thursday night it was really busy. Staff were attentive and friendly and never intrusive. I kind of wish I saw Morimoto himself, but he may have been in the other area of the restaurant. Great experience.",

We started with the fresh sashimi selection , and all the fish was super fresh and we didn't need much condiments to accentuate it as well as a hamachi roll that was heavenly.  For entrees we tried the Korean style hot bowls, and the ginger soy glazed black cod. The last time I had black cod this delicious was at NOBU, when they first opened in town. We shared a side dish of the duck Confit fried rice, and duck egg .   Service was a little slower than what we would have liked, but it was a Saturday and a concert was in house so it was to be expected .  The decor was clean, and open , with a nice view of the kitchen, grill stations , and open view of the walkway in restaurant row to people watch. The restaurant filled up very quickly .  The menu is quite extensive , and although the varying options are appreciated , it made it a little more difficult to narrow down things. I know for next time I would like to try the tacos, and other fun smaller plates as opposed to entrees. Maybe more signatures of Morimoto as well, items not available at other venues.",

    "text": "A highly anticipated night of fresh fish at the famous Morimoto restaurant at the MGM. Needless to say I was excited yet afraid to see what the pricing was like. With the Morimoto striped statue at the front with the bar area playing the basket ball game and national geographic type instrumentals in the background I figured we were at least due for an interesting night. The sushi bar looked cool and further back was a steak display just on the other side of the hibachi tables. It would have been cool to have been sat near either one of those areas however instead we were seated on the other side of a pillar which blocked our view of pretty much everything. So much for Feng Shui ehh? As far as the service goes it was ok. Nothing special.(maybe they didn't see us at times bec of the pillar?)Either way I did not feel as if I was at a 5 star dining experience or anything like that. The sashimi was fresh and I did enjoy some of these dishes. The sushi rolls were mediocre nothing special.  The surf n turf we ordered looked good , however we ordered it rare and it came out well done. (they did not ask how it was and or even check the temperature upon serving the steak and the surf was just regular sashimi. All in all it was cool to try but I would not come back here unless I had to, at least not for a while. Being a local I know of a couple of places around town that are actually very comparable and if not better than Morimoto in Las Vegas.",

For dinner we both had the seafood toban yaki. While it came highly recommended I didn't necessarily find the seafood quality to be great. The dish is served like a fish boil which causes the shrimp to get over cooked. Mussels and clams were very small. Lobster tail was small but excellent. Overall great for the price and much more economical than nobu or other options on the strip.",

The shell is made from deep frying a gyoza wrap and it had guac, jalapeno and diced tomatoes. You need to get this as an appetizer. The short ribs were tender, good sauce but it's no fall off the bone kind rib. I'd come back here once in awhile because just ordering these the bill came out to $130. Those were some expensive tacos. Still great food none the less.",

    "text": "My favorite meal for this Vegas trip was Morimoto. I'm a big fan of Chef Morimoto and this restaurant didn't disappoint me at all.   We had a helpful waiter who I forgot his name(maybe Brad?) I don't recall. We came in as a party of 8 but he allowed us to have half the table order their take on chefs recommendation set(or what he thought were the most popular items in the restaurants) and allowed the other half to order entrees of our own. Usually when you get chefs recommendation style, the whole table would be forced to all get it but we were glad that we were able to get a bit of everything to try.   We ordered the braised black cod, surf and turf, seafood topan yaki and two side orders of duck fried rice. The chef recommendation that our waiter have got for us consisted of sticky ribs, beef capraccio, yellowtail tacos, Rock Shrimp Tempura, a sushi platter that consist of rolls and raw, the ribeye, and two desserts.   I will start off with the bads. I dont particularly recommend the duck fried rice. It's aite but personally its not really worth to get it at its price. A bit too dried as well. The other thing that was surprisingly not great was their sushi platter. I thought Morimoto would thrive at their sushi and such but it was really mediocre. With that said, the winner of it all goes to their Rock Shrimp Tempura. Their rock shrimp tempura that are in two styles( wasabi aioli and spicy kochujian sauce) with a side of celery(think of eating wings) + blue cheese sauce was pretty horrendous. It was like their take on the chinese style mayo walnut shrimp but worse. This dish just didn't come together for me and the flavors didn't make much sense. It was the memorable dish that I wanted to forget.   Goods: everything else was pretty damn good. I would say the one that stand out to me the most was actually their ribeye. First of all, I didn't know they offered steaks but it was overwhelmingly delicious. It was actually one of the better steaks I've had that might be able to compete with Craft and that is some high praising cause Craft Steakhouse(which is next door)is the best. Not only was it seasoned well, it was almost melt in your mouth good and you can tell high quality it was. Some other dish that were memorable was the yellowtail/hamachi tacos. It was really refreshing and delicious. The surf and turf, I thought the turf part was forgettable but I forgot the sashimi style yellowtail(almost like a capraccio) was pretty delicious but I prob wouldn't order this again just to eat 50% of the dish. Beef carpraccio, which I thought was pretty delicious, Had a nice sauce and it comes with a fair amount. Another surprise was their sticky ribs. For a japanese restaurant, I wouldn't think of coming here to get their ribs but damn it was fall off the bone good which allowed me to just fork the sticky ribs off and eat it instead of having to dirty myself using my hands. The seafood topan yaki was okay. I thought they were generous with the amount of seafood they had. You can think of almost any kind of seafood and it'll be there consisting from clams-mussels-scallop-crab-lobster. I thought the desserts were fairly nice as well. The donuts were really soft and fluffy. Just the right amount of sugar around it and you can squeeze the amount of custard you want in it. The chocolate dish was a nice show to watch and I thought it was pretty delicious as well.  The chefs recommendation cost $396 for 4 people. Personally given the amount of food they gave us, I thought it was a reasonable price for how good it tasted. I just really recommend that you substitute the rock shrimp tempura for something else.   I would definitely come back.",

The acidity and sweet dressing paired the octopus perfectly!  Then we had the oysters w/foie gras. You gotta have this. Beautifully selected large oysters, none of the small oysters of course.   Tried the spare rib's. I thought this was okay, but my husband and friend liked it a lot. I'm not that big of a meat eater. It was good, but I think there were other things I would have tried instead.   Tuna Pizza - We had this at another Morimoto restaurant (Disney Springs, Florida) and it's the same here. Does not disappoint! Love this!   We finished it off with some roll's (seaweed tasted like it was toasted! Yum!) and a Chashu Bop which was cooked in front of us.   Dessert - YOU HAVE TO GET THE FLAMING CHOCOLATE DESSERT. It's both a show, drink and sweet dessert delight. Yes it's $20, but totally worth it!   Also, seating was great too. We got seated right away w/out reservations. Just head over to the bar (first come first serve).",

    "text": "This restaurant is one of those places that you so happen to pass by and knowing the name on the restaurant always wonder what the food would taste like, only to finally try it and fall in love. That's what happened with me and Morimoto Las Vegas--love at first bite.  To prepare yourself for a place such as Morimoto, you need to get the idea of all you can eat sushi taste as well as any other Sushi you've tried in your local Town that's considered the best sushi and throw that taste memory out the window for this experience. Once you've completed that task when you arrive at the restaurant sit down and prepare yourself for a culinary Journey. This restaurant is more than just a sushi place. The food here is eclectic, covering everything that you've seen him cover in his Iron Chef episodes, ranging from Italian to Thai to Japanese, of course.   There are few signature dishes that you must try and if your server tells you about the Omakase menu which is a price fix menu for the evening, you should definitely get it.  We wanted to try everything that we've seen him do in Iron Chef episodes and fixed-price menu was perfect. Don't think about the number of courses that you are about to get because the food that you receive is filling and six courses is perfect. We did add on to items because we wanted to try it no matter what the case was and that was the tuna pizza and their special role of the day which, in this case, was the rainbow roll made with real snow crab not the imitation crab you find in other sushi restaurants.  We started with an appetizer that was not on the menu for our servers suggestion. The tune of pizza with anchovy aioli, topped with marinated purple olives, jalapeno, and greens, on a crispy tortilla cracker was a great starter. The crispy tortilla was as thin and as crisp as a cracker with the soft beautiful tuna sashimi and the perfectly salty and Briny aioli kicked off the evening with a bang.  Our first official Omakase course was an appetizer of tuna tartare made the way that he makes it on Iron Chef America. The tote are came in a square glass plate finely minced alongside several toppings including Wasabi, a sweet soy reduction, rice puffs, wasabi cream, and creme fraiche. A dipping sauce and crisp bread with Morimoto caviar completed the experience. It was decadent and fun to eat with a flat \"shovel\". After polishing off the tartare, I ate the sweet plum that comes with it to cleanse my palete for the next course.  Wagyu Carpaccio topped with Summer truffle shavings and lightly cooked in hot oil and soy was our next course. The walk was extremely tender and easy to melt in my mouth and with the shavings of Summer truffle and a few touches of microgreens it was the perfect bite. The size of the Carpaccio was absolutely perfect for the flavor that it gave. It was filled with unami. I honestly could have eaten three or four of them in a row.  The third course had to be one of the most fun dishes I've ever eaten. It was a fondue served with tomato inside the cheese as well as a touch of olive oil and a small sprig of rosemary. Around the fondue plate there was togarashi for heat, as well as fresh muscle, shrimp, fish balls made in House of course, as well as vegetables and something very unique that they make their, called a salmon ship. With the house noodles provided with the fondue plate, at the end I mixed the noodles in and it became a spaghetti course with an Asian Flair.  The 4th course was our Sushi course which consisted of the additional side order of rainbow roll which was their special role for the evening. The Maki was amazing, but the star of the entire course was the one nigiri piece of fatty tuna. It absolutely melted in my mouth and was one of the best things I've ever eaten. With just a touch of wasabi, each nigiri piece was amazing, from the Saba to the snapper. I believe the other critics when they say that Morimoto has the best sushi on the strip, hands down.  Finally the main course arrived which was our surf and turf. Are surf and turf for the evening was American wagyu cooked medium rare with shiitake mushroom and two types of sauce, grilled pearl onions, and micro bok choy, as well as a lobster tail and Claw served with purple potato and a sweet potato puree of some sort. Everything on the plate was amazing, from the wagyu that melted in the mouth and was perfectly cooked, as well as the lobster tail, which was tender, buttery,and sweet.  With our bellies full we successfully made it to the desert , which is the one you will see every time you look up Morimoto Las Vegas. This desert is his chocolate sphere filled with marshmallow whipped and a chocolate sorbet. It was just incredible. Textures abound and rich, it was the best ending to the experience.  You just try this restaurant, even if it's a once in a lifetime event. It is worth every penny.",

We opted for an omakase meal that ended with the flaming chocolate dessert. I have no idea what most of it was because the place was so loud I couldn't hear the Server at my end of the table. But the Waygu did not disappoint, nor did anything else.   I also have no idea what the whole evening cost... but it was worth the money. If you put your trust in the chef's hands you will not be let down.",

I did my menu research early, so when we arrived I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to try. I also prepared myself to be underwhelmed, after all of the press and hoopla in general. We stayed away from a bunch of sushi, since many reviews mentioned that it wasn't anything special. We started with a couple of drinks: a Las Vegas Fizz and a Sin City Revival and we were happy. Not too sweet, and you could taste some alcohol in there.  The Toro Tartare was fun with the paint palette of goodies. The Morimoto Sushi was interesting. We took our time and savored the different levels of the stacks with the fun sauces. The Oyster Foie Gras was so good, we had to order it twice. The Pork Belly app was also wonderful. The Duck Fried Rice was tasty, but not amazing and the Sticky Ribs were our least favorite.  A bunch of food, a bottle of sake and a couple of cocktails with outstanding service all around came to just over 200 bucks. A pretty good deal by Vegas standards. One of our favorite Vegas meals in quite a while.",

The staff went above and beyond to make sure our dinner lived up to our expectations. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, our drinks were always full, and we were visited by two managers throughout the evening.   The food was truly delicious. Yes, it's expensive, but I feel it's worth it when you consider the whole dining experience. We started with the tuna pizza; it was super fresh and had a great combination of flavors. We moved to a soft shell crab roll, which was okay. The flavors were good, but the roll wasn't holding together very well. My wife had the miso black cod and I had the Thai curry snapper. Both entrees were amazing. Though, I think my entree edged out her entree. And, we finished the meal with the Japanese cheesecake souffle, even though we were stuffed. I'm glad we went for it.   Honestly, if you're looking for a romantic spot for dinner, check this place out!",

It's funny because for a sushi place the steak tasted better. Morimoto toro tartar was whatever. Tiny amount of sturgeon caviar. Famous dish so ordered it but was not impressed.   Cod was pretty good.   Sushi was pretty good.   Spent over $500 for my friend and I. I enjoyed going once but probably won't go back. I give this place 3 stars but the steak is a 5 star easy. There are better restaurants in Vegas. Let's just say that.",

The first thing I notice was the service which was on point from start to finish! They take care of their guests in their house which is why I always return. Their presentation with rolls is phenomenal, their hot bowls are are amazing, their salad are so crisp, their pork chops just right, and not to mention their seafood soups with lobster! Their desserts are so light, sweet, and creamy! I recommend try them all!! If only I had the chance to take photos and videos, but the dishes are darn good, I honestly forgot !

Our whole experience from start to finish was superb from the service to the food to the atmosphere. I would definitely recommend making a reservation as it is a very popular spot in Las Vegas located in the MGM Grand.   Staff Shout Outs: Manny and Chef Mai. They were so friendly and accommodating and helped make our experience wonderful. I was in a party of 4 and all of us stated we would come back to this establishment simply because of Manny and Chef Mai. Thank you Manny and Chef Mai!  We had a unique experience where we did half sushi and half Teppanyaki (similar to hibachi style but much more high end and delicious). Chef Mai prepared our Chicken and Steak Teppanyaki and everything was perfection. The preparation of all the dishes were top notch. We also got the $90 sushi platter. Uh-mazing! It was more than enough for 4 people to share and you got to try unique sushi rolls with shrimp, tuna, yellowtail, etc.   If you are in Las Vegas, don't miss out on this dining experience at Moriomoto!",

Making a reservation was easy, and the hostesses were super friendly when we arrived. Neither of us had eaten there before, so we weren't very familiar with the food or drink menu. Our server, Jeff, recommended the wagyu manhattan which I will admit I was a bit skeptical about. In hindsight, it was easily the best cocktail I've ever had. I usually won't order the same cocktail twice at new restaurants because I like trying different ones, but in this case I couldn't help it. It seriously is that good.  Most of the food items we ordered also came from Jeff's recommendations. I could rave about every one of them. The sashimi was fantastic - even the spicy tuna taco appetizers were amazing. They have a really fun hamachi tartare dish that comes with caviar. If I had to pick a favorite, I'd probably go with the wagyu carpaccio. It was incredible. I also really enjoyed the bibimbap style dish they have (I forget the exact name) but it comes in a hot stone pot and was delicious!  Amazing food, amazing drinks, and amazing service. If you're in Las Vegas and want a memorable dining experience, Morimoto is the place you want to be.",

Morimoto failed badly at service and food. Our waiter was a twitchy kid with ADHD who brought out Char Siu Bop instead of the Pork Char Siu salad we ordered. For my pork chop, he brought out a knife and lectured me to be careful because it's sharp.  Look kid, I'm a doctor.  I'm okay wielding sharp metal instruments.  No need for the patronizing shit. Whoever is running the front of the restaurant needs to retrain the waitstaff.  Way too intrusive and patronizing.  I came to eat, not to be lectured.  In all the years of dining, I've only ever sent back two dishes, ever.  Congrats on being one of them Morimoto. The pork chop was Dead Sea salty.  Inedible. Next up was the black cod with ginger soy reduction.  The cod was overwhelmed with sugar and I cannot taste any ginger or soy.  Not a very well balanced dish. This really should be a $12 thing at Applebee's and not a $38 dish.    Prior to the evening at Morimoto we had dine at Kabuto.  The contrast between the two establishments could not be more stark.  These celebrity chef restaurants rest too much on the name of the chef.  They do almost no work to keep things high quality.  We won't be back.",

There's an option to have the chef pick their favorite dishes depending on how much you want to spend per person. We wanted to choose what we wanted, so we skipped their \"prix fixe\" meal.   Tuna pizza, 5 stars: My husband's favorite. I personally didn't like the olive combination with my raw tuna, but it was definitely different. I liked the really crispy cracker that was the crust of the pizza, and the tuna was really fresh.  Laksa noodle soup, 4 stars: Really thick for my preference on noodle soup, but the flavor was there. I think it could've been diluted down or maybe we got the bottom of the pot.  Duck duck goose, 4 stars: Pretty good, but a little overhyped for me on yelp. I thought the duck confit was a little chewy, but the duck meatball was really good. The gooseberry compote was a sweet pairing with the seared duck breast, which we enjoyed very much.  Kakuni, 5 stars: Amazing 10 hour pork belly. I wish I could make this pork belly at home. Served with rice congee and soy-scallion jus, which is just the perfect complement to this pork belly. Its so tender, you can eat the whole thing with a spoon.  Ishi yaki kakuni bop, 4 stars: Not exactly the same as the pork belly as in the Kakuni. I don't think this one is braised for 10 hours. Its not as tender, but its a cool rendition of the bi bim bap with Japanese flavors  Chirashi, 5 stars: SO good. The fish is so fresh and has the perfect combination of rice/sides/fish.  I would come here next time and just get this if I were craving really good sashimi.  Overall, obviously we ordered too much for 2 people. But we really wanted to try everything and took some of it home too. I highly recommend Morimoto to anyone wanting good and fancy Japanese food.",

Me and my bf got to the restaurant early so we went to the bar to order cocktails, which were made really well. The bartender was very nice and he was very attentive. When our table was ready the host was really nice and polite to wait for us to gather our things to moved to a table.  When we got seated we ordered the $50 chef sushi, the surf and turf, and the miso black cod, my favorite. Everything was good the waiter was very informative, we always order too much but the food was very good. I would recommend and be back when I visit Vegas again :)",

    "text": "the way that this establishment represents the iron Chef Morimoto is an insult.  For sushi lover or you can call me a sushi snob, this was overwhelmingly disappointing starting off with the service. We got seated at the sushi bar ready to get omakase. Our waitress does not explain anything about the menu and the sushi chefs alone doesn't really talk to you either about the menu which is kind of odd since we came right when it opened and there was one table. So I went ahead and helped myself since no one else was. I opened the menu and saw chefs choice combination which says sushi/sashimi. No where that is says cut rolls so of course I ordered this and what do I see? Cut rolls. Okay it comes in a platter and I'm thinking okay maybe this isn't the end of it? Maybe there's more? We are half of it which is ONLY nigiri. I asked our waitress and she's like no this is it. Ummm ok. Super awkward as we told her it was extremely misleading and she never informed us about it when we asked her before we ordered it. We asked what do you get with the 50-100-200 price difference? She said you get more sushi. Anyways we got No apologies, just a smirk and a wack explanation with a side of \"your problem I can't do anything for you\" attitude. I should've known something was off when I asked for Yuzu paste and she said no there's none yet another server was able to get us an alternative yuzu paste. anyways we were pretty much stuck with this sushi platter with cut rolls which my bf and I don't even eat. We left it as it was and hate to waste food but this one I couldn't swallow. Tbh, if it wasn't for KAREN, the manager, she literally came to save the day. 4 stars for her alone and she did the most she could, gave us a good discount and one of the best desserts I've had. I'm thinking I wish my food was as bomb as the dessert. She made our experience better in the end but the staff overall was just extremely bad. The waitress didn't even say bye and even in between time she was very intruding asking if we're done with our dishes yet. She definitely doesn't know observation and can't tell if a customer is done or working on it. Sadly the manager says she's one of the best server and I can honestly disagree. This place isn't cheap so I'm paying $$$ I expect the server to be knowledgeable like its your homework. I know this could've been a much much better experience but with the lack of knowledge that the staff has and sushi chefs being so unfriendly, it's so hard to want to come back here.",

We had a 930pm reservation and because of that, maybe the sushi wasn't the freshest. My buddy and I shared a $100 platter of sushi which left us wanting more. The quality of the fish was very average. It didn't taste any better than a standard sushi restaurant. The salmon wasn't buttery, the two types of tuna tasted the same but one was supposed to be \"higher end fatty tuna.\" If your craving sushi, try mizumi at the Wynn, for the same price, you will get a much better experience. I had high expectations for Morimoto, especially given the hefty prices and I left disappointed.",

For being a high end sushi restaurant I would expect more and a higher quality than what we received. The prices of rolls are higher than typical roles but this place is categorized as a higher end restaurant. But for the price I'd say skip this place, all of the rolls were quite bland and not so flavorful. We were only in Vegas for a few days but feel we could've found a place better for a more reasonable cost. If you're staying at the MGM it may be conveniently to their location but you'll find better places in the area in no time.",

    "text": "Wandering about MGM Grand, we discovered Morimoto. Due to our love of sushi, my husband and I made a reservation for our anniversary dinner. When we slept through our reservations (insert crying face), they were kind enough to accommodate us the next night (Friday at 7:00 PM).  When you first walk in, there is a bar area to the left with some seating, but the real piece de resistance is the sushi bar, with colossal black and white photography pictures towering behind the sushi chefs. Towards the back of the dining room, they have their perfect wagyu beef on display in a glass case and seating for larger parties. The place was outlined in dark brown/black undertones with hardwood floor, and as expected, everything was clean.   Now, about the food. OMAKASE is the only way to do this. I am not sure I would have enjoyed it as much honestly. Yes, it is overpriced, but so is everything else in Vegas. With the Omakase, you get your money's worth. Omakase is chef selection of various items on the menu. When we dined 8/17/18, it was priced at $140 per person. Because my husband does not eat beef or pork, he opted to try the chef selection sashimi.   The Omakase started off with a beautifully plated tuna tartar with an assortment of flavors to pair - nori paste, wasabi, sour cream, chives, bread crumbs, soy sauce, and a Japanese plum for palate cleansing. Next course was the wagyu beef with tomatoes, arugula, and fungi on top. The sauce really made this dish. Third course, and perhaps my favorite, was a seafood bisque with scallops, shrimp, and mussel, and to keep it nice a hot, there was a lit fire built into the bowl. Fourth course (not pictured because I practically swallowed it) was an assortment of nigiri that was fresh and delicious. Fifth course was the heaviest and was their \"surf and turf.\" It consisted of a grilled lobster tail, bok choy with mushroom and potatoes, and steak. On the menu, this entree alone was priced at $48. The lobster tail was delicious and the steak very tender. Again, great flavors. The last course was their flaming tart dessert, which was good, but perhaps my least favorite. After the fire burned out, there was a very strong char taste I did not really care for. But good thing my husband ordered the cheesecake dessert, which he reluctantly shared. And that was amazing because of the deconstructed crust and sweet berries. I ended up trying some of his assortment of sashimi as well, and it was the freshest sushi I've had. My fourth course of nigiris came with uni, which I have been trying to acquire a taste for. Their uni was so fresh, I actually enjoyed it! We also ordered two drinks, \"white lily,\" and \"devil's advocate,\" both delightful.  Service was exceptional of course. Matt was our server, and he was very kind and helpful. Two of the managers approached our table to check on us. And even though the restaurant was busy, the staff were all calm, attentive, and everything orderly. I loved all of it and would definitely come back (likely for special occasions because it is pricier).",

    "text": "You can easily make a reservation through the OpenTable app! I recommend making a reservations because they can be full during certain nights. The app says the dress code is business casual, but looking around us as we ate, you could away with dressing a little more casual. Located at the MGM Grand hotel, it's hard to miss this restaurant because of all the beautiful lights surrounding it!  To start, I had the koshihikari echigo beer ($15), one of my favorite Japanese beers and I'm so glad they had it here! My sister had the mango matcha punch ($17) and it was very delicious! The alcohol was subtle and it had a strong fruit/tea taste. She said it was easily the best cocktail that she's ever had!  For our appetizers/entrees-  -Sticky ribs : Each order comes with 3 pieces, we added 2 extra pieces since there were 5 of us, so the total became $37. We were not expecting it to, but these ribs slid right off the bone and melted into our mouths. Absolutely amazing, I definitely recommend this dish!  -Kakuni ($22) : Pork belly over congee! It was sweet, savory, and overall a pleasant dish! I've never had a dish like this anywhere else and while it's not really a dish that's easy to share with a lot of people, I would recommend this dish because of the flavor and how tender the pork belly is.  -Ishi yaki chashu bop ($39) : Chashu (pork) over rice in a hot stone bowl. They mix it for you when they bring it to the table and mix in a sesame soy sauce. Very yummy and flavorful!  -Ishi yaki buri bop ($38) : Hamachi (yellowtail fish) over rice in a hot stone bowl. They also mix this for you at your table and in my opinion, better than the chashu bop if you like fish! The hamachi was perfectly cooked!  -Duck duck goose ($42) : A mix of duck confit fried rice, duck, and goose. Great if you like the duck & goose meat. If you're getting this for the fried rice, then I'd suggest you go with the duck confit rice side dish ($13). It also has an egg on it, has excellent flavor, and is pretty much the same size!   -Sushi combination ($55) : Chef's choice of assorted nigiri! It came with 10 pieces of nigiri and a 6 piece tuna roll. I wish their fish was more fresh, but sadly it didn't wow me. Very typical, standard fish. The rice kept falling apart, so it was hard to pick up. For $55, the portion was not bad, but I was a little disappointed. Not comparable to the omakase in Japan or even San Francisco.   For dessert, we tried the tofu mousse ($15) and the cheesecake souffle ($16). Both were delicious, I definitely liked the cheesecake souffle more!  Overall, I think that the kitchen food was much better than the sushi. I would recommend coming here and ordering those dishes!! Yes, it is more pricey here, but you're in Vegas, and the high price tag also comes with the service and it's also because of the Morimoto name. The service was excellent, our server Berto had great orecommendations & was friendly! Many people were there to take away our empty plates & refill our waters. Definitely stop by if you're in the area!",

We had opted to try their selection and had a little of everything to get a \"feel\" of the Morimoto technique of preparing his fine foods and just to try and learn what it takes to make a quality dish.  We started with the best thinnest slice of steak with various sauces, which was delicious and decadent.  Our second, was a dish featuring a seafood soup, with select cuts of seafood.  The next, and my favorite, was a selection of sushi that crossed the gamete of the types of traditional sushi from Japan.  Surf and turf was different from the previous dishes, and just a mix of meats and lobster; my wife said New York steak and I think it was filet mignon.  The last and most spectacular was the desert, served with a nice flame of 151 rum and chocolate melted over ice cream and served with fruit and whipped creme.  Such a nice presentation, I videoed the presentation.  Overall, a nice experience dining at a high-class restaurant, but for the cost, I can only do this a few times a year.",

The sushi choices were amazing, with my favorite being the eel and the spicy tuna. The pork bowl was delicious, though probably my least favorite of the dishes just because it was the most basic. The desserts were fantastic, though of course my favorite was the famous chocolate dessert where the serves melt the chocolate in it with liquid fire - such a cool presentation.  The drinks were fantastic too! I ordered the Orange Blossom, which had vodka and absinthe and looked like a delicious glass of orange jello.",

I get the dress code, what I don't get is why I was not told when I spoke to the hostess to make a reservation so I was aware. Our hotel was not just around the corner.

We originally went to the MGM looking for a different Sushi restaurant that we had visited before but found that it no longer existed so we decided to give Morimoto's a try. Needless to say I forgot the name of the original place that we had wanted to go and try and were pretty happy to have found Morimoto. we were able to walk right in as a party of four and were seated right away. The only reason I didn't give this a five is because it took a while for someone to acknowledge us and then when we were acknowledged we were not given the specials or anything that you'd expect from a high end establishment. However do not let that derail you from trying this place. We wound up Trying the the Chef's combination and it was absolutely amazing. Presentation was spectacular! Look forward to our next visit to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here with high hopes just having arrived in Vegas the previous night.  We knew Morimoto from Iron Chef so we were expecting something amazing!  We arrived right around the time they opened and were lucky enough to get a table without a reservation.  We ended up ordering the miso glazed fish, pork chop, uni, toro, and uni oyster with foie gras.  The sushi  which came out first was decent - the uni tasted fresh and melted in your mouth. The oysters that came out next were pretty good, although it had too strong of a teriyaki sauce to it which overpowered the whole dish.   Then the pork and fish came out.  The pork came in large portions which excited us at first, but after the first bite I couldn't understand how something like this could be served at such a nice restaurant.  The pork was extremely salty and it was hard for us to finish the dish.  I don't cook but I felt confident I could make a better tasting pork dish in that moment.  The fish that I ordered tasted ok but was very basic, came with no sides and was overall underwhelming.   Total bill was 200 dollars with 18 percent mandatory tip.  Lessons learned: just because dishes are expensively priced do not mean they will taste good! Also never order a pork dish at a sushi restaurant.",

    "text": "Coming here, I was expecting to be wowed, but while the food was in and of itself good, I was left overall disappointed.   Ordinarily, I would give two stars, but I take into account Vegas prices being considerably higher, and the fiery awesomeness that was dessert.  Duck meatball soup had all the right flavors going. The broth was just the right mix of sourness, saltiness, and savoriness, with each flavor being delicate instead of in your face. The meatballs were cooked to perfection, and when combined with the soup nearly melted in your mouth.  While this part of the meal was a delicate rose, it was not without its thorns. Hence, here are my critiques.  First, I found the soup a little too simple. Awesomeness aside it was a broth with four small meatballs. This brings me to my second criticism: I feel that four meatballs for the amount of broth were too few; 6-8 would be just right. Finally, all these things in mind, $14 seems steep, even with Vegas prices.   For my main course, I decided to splurge a little bit on the Toro Tartare. The toro used in this case was a medium fatty tuna (if I recall correctly), and goes for ~$150/pound!  Now, I'm a lover of fine foods and I've had several iterations of tuna tartare in my day. However, his one ranks low on my list, as it was remarkably unremarkable and underwhelming.  Don't get me wrong, the tuna was of excellent quality (although I had difficulty discerning this toro from regular tuna). The quantity was surprisingly small; about the area of a credit card, and the thickness of 2-4 coins. The consistency was somewhere between being finely chopped and minced.   All the sauces and condiments are provided on the side. This comes as a double-edged sword... on the one hand, it allowed the tuna to shine while allowing my to experiment with various flavors. The sauces/condiments were well varied too. They weren't too exotic, which I guess is a good thing, as otherwise, people may not know what to expect from something they've never heard of before.  On the other hand, no transformation took place. You had some plain, raw tuna, and various condiments on the side. I can only imagine if this were an episode of Chopped, and toro was one of the ingredients. Zakarian, Samuelson, and Guarnaschelli are presented with a star ingredient where the only transformation is a change in consistency... yeah, I'm sorry but I don't think this guy is getting the $10K prize. The taste was okay, the presentation was okay, and creativity... what creativity?  I go to restaurants to have food of a level I cannot make myself. Given all condiments, sauce, and some tuna I feel I could make a dish no worse myself.  If this were it, I would have dusted off my hands, left them with 2 stars, and gotten on with my life... but then there was dessert. Seeing the image of a flaming chocolate ball in the window had wanting to take a chance, and I'm glad I did.  First, the presentation was definitely on point, it's really quite hard to beat something being on fire right in front of you. As for the flavors, just like with the duck meatball soup, all the flavors went together wonderfully. I liked that the level of sweetness was very delicate instead of being comparable to eating straight sugar. There was just a hint of bitterness (and I think sourness). All of this together made this a spectacular dessert.   Though based on the ingredients it was simple, the creativity and presentation are what brought this dish above and beyond.   The service was extremely polite, attentive, and knowledgeable.   The location is larger than I was expecting, and has a very open, modern, all the while retaining a classy feel.",

Six sushi chefs all standing their looking at me and one other couple.  The presentation of the food is exceptional but the quality of fish is NOT as fresh as I've had at other restaurants.

After having experienced the Napa location, my standards were pretty high... and in food quality they were met!!  I called for reservations, immediately upon my realization, and it worked out great for us.  I started in the bar area and the bartender was super friendly and makes some strong drinks! Great crowd in the house and I got to rub elbows with a real cowboy.  Definitely a spot to celebrate a special occasion or if you win in the casinos!  LOL  While the service at this location wasn't on the level I have experienced in Napa I was still pleasantly fulfilled at the end of my dining experience.  If you leave hungry that is totally your own fault.  There are so many fabulous dishes to choose from!  Decor on this location was fitting and I like the privacy this location, not quite so cozy with the neighbors as it is in Napa.  Looking forward to experiencing all his restaurants on every continent given the opportunity. :)",

I'm a very small eater (I also had 3 meals prior to this) so I ordered the side of duck confit fried rice and asked for the egg to be fully cooked. My little side dish came out LAST and a lot later than my friends. My friends ordered the duck duck goose too so I don't understand why my fried rice took so long. Should be same batch no? The rice was hard like I was eating the rice at the bottom of the stone pot. Also, my egg was not fully cooked, it was still runny on the inside. I joked with my friends that my rice took so long because they were googling how to fully cook an egg lol.  My friend had the oyster foie gras and boy that thing was TINY! She also had the toro tartare. She did say they both tasted pretty good. I tried my friend's crispy whole fish and that was great.  For dessert, we all shared: Coconut Mango - My favorite dessert because I like both coconut and mango. It was refreshing. Chilled Cheesecake Souffle - Cheesecake was very soft and fluffy, I liked the flavor.  Tofu Mousse - I want to say pass on this. It was ok but not too special. Fiery Chocolate Tart - This had a pretty cool presentation. Very chocolatey for my taste. Very smooth tho so if you love chocolate and Instagram, get this.",

Unfortunately the entrees were mostly disappointing, especially the sushi platter. For $100 I expected high quality items but the rice was not well prepared and the fish was not fresh, except for the toro. Hard to believe but I've had fresher nigiri at AYCE spots in town. Do not order the sushi platter! It seems like it was prepared way in advance and left in the frig.  The yellowtail buri bop was also nothing special. Two people in our party ordered this and neither finished it.  Honestly, for these prices, the experience is superior at Nobu.",

There are plenty of options for those that don't want raw fish, and one of our favorites is the sticky ribs that fall off the bone and melt in your mouth.  If you like sushi, there may be other restaurants that offer similar quality, but this high level of taste and presentation is difficult to find. One of my favorites is the tuna tempura tacos.  The price is steep, mainly because it's the signature restaurant in the high rent MGM restaurant row. The service is exceptional and everything arrives as your finishing the previous course.  Enjoy a night out, spend a few hours enjoying an epic meal at Morimoto, and have the server choose the menu for you!",

This place was pretty pricey (not a surprise for an iron chef restaurant), but delicious nonetheless. We ordered some sushi and the ishi yaki buri bop, which was amazing because they cook it in a hot bowl right at your table! It was mesmerizing to watch and tasted great. I was however, disappointed that the cold appetizer Hamachi tacos (which were so tasty btw!) are $22 for 3 pieces! I'm the last person to be picky about food prices, but in a place like Vegas, many people are dining with groups or at least as couples, so three tacos just doesnt make sense to me.",

Morimoto Service:  Our server Prince was on point throughout the evening for our party of 10.  He asked if we wanted to go family style or individual orders and he made suggestions to ensure the best experience.  We went family style and everything he suggested worked out great.  Drinks kept flowing parallel to the conversation all night, top notch.  Morimoto Cuisine:  I sampled a lot, here are my faves.  The hamachi tacos was my favorite appetizer as the Yuzu Kosho and avocado worked so well together.  The ishi yaki buri bop/yellowtail on rice was cooked in a hot stone bowl at the table.  Fun to watch and Snap, but even more fun to eat.  The Braised Black Cod was prepped perfectly and delicious.  The Fiery Salty Caramel Chocolate Tarte is the flagship dessert for a good reason.  Aesthetically pleasing but more importantly, very tasty and I'm not really a chocolate dessert guy.  Morimoto Ambiance: Beautifully designed with classy Japanese decor throughout the restaurant.  The lighted wall behind the sushi chefs had murals of Japanese pics in black and white and really made the main dining room. It's definitely a restaurant that can be used for special occasions and date nights.  Very attractive and elegant.  All the dishes I tried were prepped well and high quality ingredients were used.  The service was top notch and enhanced the experience.    This is a great place for business dinners if the expense account is getting debited.  For non-business dinners, get ready to rack up a bill if you're hungry as the food is tasty but the portions small.  Either way, you're in for a good experience at Morimoto.  Arigato! =)",

    "text": "Masaharu Morimoto is a marketing genius as much as he is a great chef and entrepreneur. He is one of the three most well-known celebrity Japanese/American chefs in the US alongside Nobu Matsuhisa and Masa Takayama and uses that recognition to his advantage growing his Morimoto restaurant empire worldwide. The Las Vegas location of Morimoto didn't fail to impress regarding decor, food, and service for the most part, and wasn't too bad either in terms of value.  Decor  Morimoto is located in the former space that was occupied by Shibuya, my (former) favorite sushi joint on the strip. I was quite disappointed when I decided to drop by for some sushi at the bar last year to find Shibuya sporting an 'Under Construction' sign, but then I found some happiness seeing another sign next to it saying 'Morimoto Coming Soon'! I decided I had to try it the next time I was in Vegas. Regarding decor, the restaurant layout from Shibuya seemed to have gone largely unchanged, with most of the visible changes being in the artwork and design. Having spent nearly $1M on renovations, either there were a lot of back of the house changes, or the designer overcharged. I have to say I loved the backdrop of the sushi bar - my favorite part of the restaurant.  Food  My overall impression with the quality of the food at Morimoto was that the overall concept was excellent, the quality was great, but there were some misses as much as there were some hits and home runs. As per our modus operandi trying a new (to us) Japanese restaurant, we asked for the Morimoto Omakase - the omakase is usually the chef-designed, best-available, and personalized meal delivered to impress the individual diner. Morimoto's omakase consisted of seven courses with a sake/wine pairing that we added on.  The omakase started off with the Morimoto Toro Tartare. This dish hit my 'ten best things I've ever eaten in my life' list upon my first bite. The competing and complementary flavors of the accoutrements of the toro set off this mind-blowing flavor explosion. Then came the Wagyu carpaccio with white truffle - melt in your mouth amazingness. The next dish was the broiled oysters with uni and foie gras, another quick add to my top ten list. After the first three crazy delicious courses, things turned quite standard, sadly.  The rest of the dishes, including the sushi, were good at best. The quality of sushi was ok, not any better than what you would find at a good local sushi joint in a strip mall. Even the selection of sushi for the omakase was about as vanilla/boring as they come - tuna, snapper, salmon, yellowtail, bass, maki.  The main course of lobster and wagyu filet was a disappointment. The lobster was overseasoned, and the filet was tough and chewy, consistency akin to being defrosted in a microwave or sitting under a heat lamp way too long (which neither I hope would be the case here). Some parts of the meal were confusing too: an Italian-inspired shabu-shabu/fondue? The dessert was also an over-the-top flaming chocolate creation that was great but seemed out of place for the omakase. The richness of the chocolate overwhelmed the rest of the meal preceding. I love chocolate, but I would have enjoyed more of a lighter, fruit-based dessert matching the spring season.  The overall wine and sake pairings were good but were not presented professionally nor in a knowledgeable fashion. We felt that either the sommelier didn't think we had an appreciation for good wine pairings nor was she as attentive as one should be for pairing a tasting menu. I love wines from varied regions, and equally love how each varietal, region, and vintage complement different dishes. I wanted to hear how the sommelier's selection for each course made that course better with the pairing, but I was left hanging and disappointed.  Service & Value  Having made reservations months in advance, seating was immediate and near the sushi bar as we wanted. I just wanted to make sure I had a good backdrop of the bar for my selfie, and it worked! Service overall was great, with some disappointments in the sommelier service, but the server and support staff (bus, food runner, etc.) were on point. The value was somewhat questionable, as I wasn't sure if our experience was really worth $300 per person (Morimoto omakase plus wine/sake pairing and tip.) Maybe without the pairings and having just the omakase with cocktails would have held greater value to us.",

    "text": "Morimoto was such a treat!  We ended up spending almost $300 per person, but it was sooo worth it!  The food was spectacular, the service was impeccable.  In our party of 4, 3 of us ordered the 6-course omakase/prix fixe with wine/sake pairing ($140 for the omakase + ~$70 for the wine.  You can choose either sake or wine, and you can also pair your own set of dishes.) Our other party member who was not a sushi fan ordered the angry chicken ($34), and though it was excellent (tender, flavorful, and juicy), she wished she had ordered the omakase with us and asked to substitute the raw fish dishes;).  Each of us savored every bite and were completely stuffed!   The entire meal took about 3 hours from entry to exit (which was necessary to allow digestion and finishing wine between courses), so if you plan to order the Omakase, make sure you book an earlier reservation if you have to be somewhere like a show.;)  Most a la carte entrees ranged from $40-$50.  Japanese Wagyu price was not listed.  The Omakase (see picture included for each course): Course 1: Tuna Tartare, beautifully arranged with 5 or 6 special condiments to mix and match as you like and a light sauce to go over it.  Very fresh, and the condiments went perfectly.  Someone said they saw it on the show \"Best thing I ever ate\".  Course 2: Wagyu beef carpaccio, probably the best dish of the entire meal.  Thinly sliced wagyu with a ginger sauce with the perfect balance of salty/sweet/tang, topped with some caviar and fresh herbs.  When no one was looking, I picked up the plate and drank the rest of the sauce!  Sooo good!  Course 3: Tomato/cheese fondue, with fish balls, shrimp, veggies, and a spoon of hand made udon noodle.  The fondue was served in a beautiful little bowl with a candle in it to keep things melty.  I'm not sure I was a huge fan of the cold fish ball, but the rest was absolutely delicious!  Course 4: Sushi course.  5 pieces of nigiri + 1 iron chef special square roll.  Fish so fresh and delicious!  Course 5: Surf and Turf.  Wagyu steak and lobster tail.  The sauces were paired perfectly with each.  The lobster tail was served with a smear of squash puree with a truly unique flavor.  Momentous, though by this point, we were already getting pretty full.  Although my belt was about to burst, I still finished every bite!;)  Course 6: Dessert - Chocolate marshmallow ball flambe with chocolate log and cookie.  They set it on fire at the table with a liquor.  Really tasty, particularly for chocolate lovers!   The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations.  The wait staff was very attentive.  Courses were paced very well.  But best of all, Chef Morimoto happened to be there, and our waiter was able to get him to come over and take picture with us!!!  We used up all our luck on dinner, so slots went downhill from there!;)  The decor was very modern and clean, great ambiance.  They also have a teppanaki section.  Not sure how that experience is or how much that cost, but you can request it.    In short, highly recommend to anyone looking for a fancy, delicious, special occasion meal.  It costs a pretty penny, but it is worth the experience!",

My husband's pork chop was not of the greatest quality but we didn't say anything, they took it off our check..they recognized the quality not being up to par as he picked through the gristle, I guess. They gave us free dessert when we declined to order dessert and then discretely gave our 21 year old son a birthday dessert with a candle without the entire restaurant knowing. It was a wonderful meal at Morimoto.",

    "text": "Opened in mid-October, a substantial delay and relocation from original plans for The Mirage to MGM Grand's old Shibuya spot now a story of the past, Morimoto Las Vegas has been serving tourists as well as locals for just over six months, the man who helped make televised competition cooking a 'thing' in America finally joining peers including Flay, Batali and Puck with an outpost in the land of Celebrity Chefs.  Seemingly an odd time to come to Sin City, several recent big-ticket openings going belly up or struggling with nearly every Casino now featuring some sort of Big-Box Sushi concept from Mizumi and Nobu to Roku and Zuma, Morimoto occupies a lengthy footprint directly across from Fiamma and Tom Collichio's craftsteak, a striped bust of the man himself greeting guests behind a black podium where reservations are collected, General Manager Jim Bibbee overseeing a room with capacity of over two-hundred.  Designed in a style best described as upscale zen, the Sushi Bar brightly lit while other parts of the restaurant feature an ambient glow arising behind opaque glass or wood, those entering Morimoto during early hours will likely see the lounge and front sections filled with diners looking for small bites before heading off to other forms of entertainment while the back area is reserved for those making Morimoto the evening's main event, a wide range of races and ages all represented and in for a treat from the educated and professional staff.  Using mid-tempo music to help drive the mood, voiceless beats mellowing surrounding conversations but never so loud as to be an annoyance, it was just past 5:30pm when a seat was offered at a small two-top booth along the wall just outside the kitchen, greetings offered from a middle-aged man who was clearly well trained followed by a visit from Mr. Bibbee who was often seen circulating the room to make sure everything was in order.  Not just a sushi-spot, though raw fish is featured across 2/3 of a six-page menu with pricing that at times seems punitive though also offering the occasional deal, it was after a brief discussion that the decision was made to dine plate-by-plate at the kitchen's discretion, a complimentary Sake flight offering an education in Junmai Daiginjo with the Chef's signature-style from Fukumitsuya almost as smooth as water with a velvety finish while the version aged for five years in porcelain took on a Straw color and tasted not so different from Bourbon.  Deciding that a first-visit to the world of Morimoto would be well invested in the Iron Chef's signature plates, a course of Nigiri sent out before Dessert speaking to good quality as relates to fatty fishes and the silky live Octopus, it was with Sake slowly sipped and compared that three West-Coast Oysters topped in Sea Urchin, Duck Liver and sweet Teriyaki was presented on a bed of Salt crystals and Chili threads, the mixture rich and unctuous yet still 'accessible' with each $8 bite the sort of thing that will thrill experienced diners while still offering a good intro to luxury items for the timid.  Always happy to see Fowl on a menu, Chef Morimoto's Duck Duck Goose offered from his earliest days in Philly and standing alongside the Angry Chicken and Tuna Pizza as his most famous East-West Fusion plates, fans of Duck as well as those uninitiated would be well-served to investigate four different presentations offered on one plate, the long-grain fried Rice topped in a Sunny-side Duck Egg fragrant and full of diced Meat while the Meatball is undoubtedly infused with Offal amidst savory broth served clear as a bell, the confit Leg slipping off the Bone with almost no effort while the rosy Breast is barely seared atop Gooseberries.  Firing up the first Teppanyaki table just past seven o'clock, the others soon to follow as two large groups and one family sat before Chefs displaying several cuts of Beef, it was mere moments before the poignant scent of Ginger, Scallions, Garlic and Soy permeated the atmosphere, a dish of sliced Yellowtail cooked in a stone bowl tableside at first mingling well as crisp rice danced with Cilantro and julienned Vegetables but later even itself overwhelmed by the pungent scent poorly cleared by outdated ventilation.  Always overzealous for Dessert, a lowlight of many \"Asian\" restaurants as they focus on more traditional flavors such as Taro, Red Bean, Matcha or Fruit, Masaharu's time in North America has seen the Chef adapt to local palates by way of dishes such as airy Doughnuts with pipettes of Custard and a cone of Whipped Cream made for dipping while both the Tofu Mousse with Black Sesame as well as the fluffy Orange Cheesecake are nicely balanced by fresh Citrus, the $20 Fiery Chocolate Tart immediately drawing eyes from all over the room as the dark sphere is doused in flames revealing a center of Marshmallow, Dark Chocolate Sorbet and Salty Caramel Ganache, though even this decadent dish tinged in booze proved no match to umami-infused air around it.",

Thank you Chef Lou. So proud of you and your hard work. The whole staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. The decor is very modern & updated yet still inviting.

Supposably only one reservation available yet many tables sat empty while we were there. Not sure what was behind that. Best attribute of the dining experience was the presentation of food. All picture quality. Table next to us did a 6 course fixed mela for $140 and while it was expensive their dining experience looked exquisite. Edamame was $14 - really expensive but very fresh tasting. Made mistake by asking for a spice sauce on second order and it tasted horrible but we didn't return it since we asked for it. Presentation of sashimi dinner. Salad and ribs were all picture worthy. Wasn't impressed with service at all. We poured our own champagne most of the night and even thought the bottle was empty even thou not turned over because every waiter just ignored refilling our glasses. Waiter didn't entertain much flexibility. First answers were no substitutes or \"no\". Asked to plug in cell phone - waiter said they'd go ask but never game back with an answer. You won't eat for less than $100/pp and the food was worth it but not the service. .",

The staff was very friendly although we were a little late and seated us pretty quickly. Our server Lisa was great. She was quite understanding when my boyfriend had told her beforehand that he's having a headache and not to feel any type of way about his demeanor.  I ordered a few simple things for us to try: -Wagyu beef carpaccio  -rock shrimp tempura  -unagi roll -4 pieces of salmon sashimi (price was per piece)   Unfortunately my boyfriend was only able to eat 1 slice of the beef carpaccio... but everything was DELICIOUS!! The beef carpacccio was great! Nothing like I've ever tasted! The unagi roll just melts in your mouth. I've never tasted a roll that just melts in your mouth like that!! The salmon sashimi was also melt-in-your-mouth good and fresh. The shrimp was also really good (one sweet, one spicy/tangy) even tho we had to take it to go.   I couldn't even tell the staff it was my boyfriend's birthday but what made up for it was seeing Mr. Morimoto standing with the sushi chefs!!! Thank you Lisa and staff for being quick and understanding about that night!",

There's bar, sushi bar, and teppanyaki seating in addition to the regular dining tables. No outdoor seating.  Our order 10/23/2016 Toro Tartare: ($31) Wasabi, Nori Paste, Sour Cream, Sturgeon Caviar Oyster Foie Gras: ($23) Market Oysters, Foie Gras, Uni, Teriyaki Kakuni: ($18) 10 Hour Pork Belly, Rice Congee, Soy-scallion Jus 10 Piece Chef's Combination Sushi ($45) 10 Piece Chef's Combination Sashimi ($50) O-toro: $16/piece Duck Duck Goose: Duck Meatball Soup, Duck Confit Fried Rice, Gooseberry Compote Side of Duck Confit Fried Rice: ($12) topped w/ Fried Duck Egg Fiery Salty Caramel Chocolate Tart: ($20) Dark Chocolate Sorbet, Marshmallow, Salty Caramel Ganache, Spiced Rum Green Tea ($6) Double Espresso ($6.50) Las Vegas meets Japan: ($16) Belvedere Vodka, Nigori Sake, Lavender Shrub Wagyu Manhattan: ($17) Wagyu infuse Iwai Japanese Whiskey, Walnut Bitters  I first had the Kakuni and Toro Tartare at Morimoto Philadelphia. The kakuni isn't sweet nor is it too oily. There's a good amount of meat that is extremely soft. The Toro Tartare is very fun to eat w/ the unique dips. Both are favorites of mine and a must order!  The Oyster Foie Gras was interesting but I felt that the teriyaki was a bit overpowering. I also would've rather had the oyster raw. Wouldn't order again for next time even though I love uni, oyster, and foie gras (a bit disappointing).  Absolutely loved the sashimi! Extremely fresh and highly recommend. Our waiter said about 90% of the fish is imported straight from Japan, so saves you a trip, right?  The Duck Confit Fried Rice was very flavorful with the egg cooked perfectly on top. Our friend who ordered the Duck Duck Goose loved the soup & the fried rice on his dish but didn't care for the slices of duck. He said he would just order the Duck Meatball Soup and the Duck Fried Rice next time. I tried some of the duck and was surprised how it didn't taste overwhelmingly like duck (which I'm not too much a fan of to begin with). The pieces were quite tender as they were cooked to a medium rare, so I enjoyed it.  I first tried the Fiery Salty Caramel Chocolate Tart at Morimoto Napa and always love how they pour the \"liquid fire\" over the chocolate dome. EXTREMELY chocolatey & sweet, that even among 3 people, we weren't able to finish everything. When I booked our reservation, it was to celebrate a friend's birthday, but he couldn't attend the dinner in time, so our waiter was nice enough to still bring us a sorbet that would've been for the birthday boy. The apricot sorbet was served w/ mixed fruit that was very refreshing. None of us are real fans of apricot so we were all surprised at how much we enjoyed the sorbet.  BF ordered the Wagyu Manhattan (per the suggestion of our waiter) and thought it was quite interesting, but unsure if he would ordered again. The Las Vegas Meets Japan is VERY floral, so none of the boys liked it. I love lavender so I liked the drink (Note: It is a bit of a creeper as the drink is very smooth, so be careful!)  If you get to the restaurant right when they open, you don't need to worry about reservations (yet). I had reservations at 5:15PM as I was told that was the earliest they had left. We got there at 4:50PM and immediately checked-in. Those who had the 5PM reservations were quickly seated once the restaurant was opened, however, while we were waiting, we noticed there were several walk-ins who were seated before us (we were the last ones to be seated). Not sure why we didn't get seated earlier if there was availability before the walk-ins. =/ Around 6:30PM, the restaurant did get full, so if you do want to eat around that time, then I highly recommend reservations.  Service was good though our waiter forgot to come back to get our entree order after we placed our appetizer order (and even left before one person in our party got to order their entree and had to flag him down later). It looked like there were several floor managers over-looking everything to make sure everything was going smoothly. Drinks were constantly re-filled (and occasionally tea even poured), and napkins folded when a customer left their seats.  Definitely try if you've never been to a Morimoto's!",

Good was tasty and loved the cure cocktail selection for this spot. Ordered the Asian pear adult beverage and have to say it was super tasty and not too sweet. Matt my waiter was very helpful and patient with our table and loved having him for our evening. We started with the $100 sushi platter which is like 25 pieces of mixed assortment that is the chef choice. Loved all the pieces on the platter. Then we had to order the ribeye and ordered it medium but for those of you who like it slightly less runny just let it sit there on the 400 degree cast iron plate to finish off and it's perfect! The ginger sauce is really amazing and adds the most amazing sweet and savory touch to this perfect meat! After a bottle of cold sake and wine we had no room for dessert! $600 later including tip for 4 people it was a nice evening out on the strip. Will bring more out of towners here again for sure!",

    "text": "Definitely had a wild food experience here. A couple friends and I were out for a nice birthday meal inside of the MGM, made reservation and sat within a couple moments.  First the good: Appetizer gyoza was a knock out. Firm, delicious, little sauce with it, simply amazing. Next, the dessert was fantastic. We had the rum soaked chocolate with ice cream thing that everyone takes pictures of. Worth the price.  Now the amazing: The A5 Wagyu at $35 an oz, 3oz. minimum. The best piece of meat I've ever had in my life. End of story. Amazing flavor, cooked to perfection. It had the texture of fat, without an ounce of fat on it. Hard to describe but amazing.  The bad: The service was ordinary. Friendly, but ordinary. Waiter didn't introduce us to the restaurant, didn't offer recommendations, specials, nor ask us essentially anything. We inquired about the sushi, and he barely remembered what it contained... which leads me to the next bit. The extremely bad: The sushi is straight up bad. The rice was mushy, the fish was flavorless, the presentation was ordinary. We firmly believe that the MGM probably rocks the same sushi for every restaurant in the hotel, because it was so hard to believe the sushi came from this place. By no means are we sushi snobs, but it was flat out, bad. No way around it. We really wish the waiter gave us some clue of what we were getting ourselves in to, considering spending about $500 on a meal. Huge disappointment. We left upset, feeling cheated out of what should have been a much better food experience.  Overall: If you get the steak, appetizers, you'll be fine. Just avoid that sushi and go somewhere proper.",

The ishiyaki bibimbop with kakuni is amazing as always.  Negitoro just melts in your mouth.  Yellowtail kama was huge.  It was supposed to be appetizer but it actually filled me up eating one of the two that came in a dish.  Though it was bit hard to locate this place in MGM grand..",

    "text": "I loved watching Chef Morimoto on Iron Chef! So I was very excited to dine in his newest restaurant in Vegas.   Service: Absolutely Amazing. The hostess sat us earlier per our request because our show ended earlier than expected. She was very accommodating. Our server Jan was absolutely amazing. He was friendly and attentive. We ordered the short ribs appetizer which originally comes with 3 pieces, but because there were 4 of us he brought our 4 pieces. Jan also brought out some birthday champagne for my sister even though her birthday is two weeks away! The service here was above and beyond what was expected and made the experience here even more enjoyable.   Ambience: Beautiful and tasteful. The decor was pleasing to the eyes and the lighting not too dark - as too often occurs in many Las Vegas restaurants.   The Food: Best Sushi in Vegas. We ordered the sushi and the sashimi for the table. Everything was so fresh! The preparation was breathtakingly beautiful. It was the probably the best spicy tuna maki we have ever enjoyed. For dessert we got the Sorbet Trio - the best of the 3 being the coconut green tea sorbet. We also had the Fiery Salty Caramel Tarte which was a dark chocolate sorbet with marshmallow enclosed in a chocolate sphere over which flaming Bacardi 151 was poured over and came with chocolate caramel ganache atop a chocolate shortbread cookie. As the fiery 151 was poured on the chocolate sphere it was engulfed in a mesmerizing flame which melted the sphere and exposed the delicious dessert inside.  The entire experience here was exquisite - one of the best dining experiences I've had in Vegas.",

    "text": "Morimoto was a big disappointment. Besides the service that was great everything else lacked. We ordered the 30 piece sashimi ($150) - honestly, the presentation was nice but the taste was not anything amazing. I had better, fresher fish in other places. The steak ($100) was again a big disappointment. It was nothing special and the ribeye had a lot of fat. Like a lot - usually, they trim that, not serve that to customers. Meat was good but overall for the price I would not ever have it again. I also had the yellowtail appetizer and it was cut too thick and again, was too chewy. The dessert was the only thing I would go back for: the second one on the menu, the mango something. It was super good.  Overall, besides the dessert - never again. Spending $650 on a dinner for 4 people and all of us leaving with a bitter taste in our mouths is not a good sign. I am giving 3 stars because of service and dessert.",

The Morimoto Black Obi Soba beer was a great complement to the dishes- it tasted like a cross between a Porter and Guinness. An interesting note, Morimoto beers are made by Rogue Brewery. We also had the small chef's combo sashimi that was good but not great. Definitely expected a little something more here. We ended the meal with a deep fried whole fish that was also good but could've used a few extra seconds in the fryer. All in all,a really good meal at a surprisingly affordable price. Would definitely come back again and again.",
