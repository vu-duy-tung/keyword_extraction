Waitress was super friendly, quick, abd knowledgable when helping to pick out beers to try... Caprese salad was great, and very large. Meatballs were an unexpected treat! They were absolutely delicious!!!! The bread with the garluc5 spread was also great...  Not a random pizza spot, the chef was on point!!! Can't wait to come back here again....",

They have two sides...A takeout side when you order and seat yourself and a side where you are seated and then order.  We ordered a slice of pizza from the takeout side..not really thinking...and after deciding we would rather sit at a table...we waited to be seated. After being seated we informed the hostess that we ordered from the togo side, wherein we were told by a manager I'm guessing (who was very pleasant) we would have to order more food if we wanted to sit at a table. Okay, not a problem :) let's do it...and she left.  Then the waitress came over and ...if looks could kill...we would be dead...lol. She was extremely rude and refused to hear the fact that we were going to order more food. Once my date left the table to check on why the food was taking so long, she walked over and demanded I leave....and at that point I lost my appetite and didn't want to even bother causing a scene or addressing the manager... there was really no reason to ruin our night over whatever issue this waitress was having. Customer service is not a priority here.",

    "text": "This place was the biggest surprise of my Vegas trip. I went in expecting just some generic meat/cheese replacements, and that is not what I got at all.   When researching places to eat with vegan options, this one came up, but I immediately thought to myself, ive done the fake za before, many times, might want to go with something different. I am glad I made the time to come here.   I ordered the not your mommas garlic bread as an app, since it was happy hour this was half off!!!! Then a Back East Buffalo and the \"cheesecake\" for dessert.   The garlic bread was good. It was probably what I was most excited about, being a garlic bread fan, although it ended up being my least favorite of the three (but still, very good). There were just enough for 2 to share, so if you have more than 2 I would suggest maybe getting a second order or second ap.   The pizza was great! It was almost perfect, a refreshing bed of carrots and celery with buffalo sauce, vegan ranch, and gardein chicken and daiya. The carrots and celery made this pie for me, and I hate celery! but this was cut thin and the mingling with buffalo sauce and the ranch made it all delicious. I am not usually a big gardein fan, but this seemed to be marinated in the sauce, and tasted fairly good. My only complaint is that the crust was not evenly cooked, with some burnt like spots on one side, but it wasn't very bad, just that part was extra crunchy.   And now the star of the show, the cheesecake. I was expecting generic vegan cheesecake, and I got a great tasting cheesecake if it were to stand alone, but alas it didn't, it came with a pineapple compote that was probably the best tasting fruit compote I have had in my life! So good, lighly herbaceous, just delicious.   Service was great throughout, and my dining companion enjoyed her slices as well. Next time im in Vegas, this place I will be!",

Our server was very unenthused to serve us and our over all experience was maybe 3 stars.  The reason I'm leaving them one star is after the restaurant my brother-in-law and I started feeling sick. We both ordered a side Caesar salad and a small pizza. Not only did we stay up all night throwing up but we stayed in our hotel room the entire following day with food poisoning.  I was curious if it was from the alcohol but I was the only one in our group that was actually drinking that night. Our vegas trip was ruined.",

Mainly the caprese salad loaded with fried capers and bitter greens, I would regularly come here for that. Id give them 5 stars but their pizza is a miss for me- the more toppings the undercooked dough you'll end up eating. Thumbs up for their salads, and thumbs down for their pizzas. Oh the cannolis are pretty good though.",

They have a separate vegan menu that does not limit you to just pizza.  As I am a die hard pizza fan, I had to have the personal pan.  This is one large pie! The crust is paper thin and to die for.  They put on  just the right amount of garlic and Daiya cheese. Since I polished off the whole thing, its a good thing I had to walk back to my hotel.   I have been to Vegas before and ate a lot of Subway. This time, I had better options almost everywhere I went.  I saved a copy of the menu so I can reminisce!  I did have to laugh when the waiter came to take our order and I ordered off the vegan menu, he actually said, \"You know that's vegan, right?\" Yes, my friend, that is why I plowed  through 2,957 tourists to get here before lunch!  I can still taste the garlic...",

    "text": "Ok you guys... Took Sarie out for a little 5th of July lunch.  I was pretty hung this morning, so we thought some sausage and carbs would definitely do the trick. Found a groupon for this joint. It's in Mandalay place, nice location. (It's always fun to stare at Pete Rose sitting at an empty autograph table). At the podium we were quoted a ten minute wait, which was exactly how long it took. Seated at a crappy corner table, then I asked to move to a slightly less crappy corner table. Oh well. They have a very nice beer selection. Great microbrews including my favorite beer ever brewed, New Belgium's 'La Folie.' Try it if you dare: a sour brown ale aged in merlot casks. Very well babanced, perfect use of Brettanomyces and tannin. Whoooohooo. The people next to us had a gigantic pepperoni pizza on the table.  It looked alright, a little soggy for my taste. I also saw some spaghetti and red sauce dishes that appeared to be nothing spactacular. Sarie ordered a cup of coffee and we relaxed a minute. The menu looked good, we decided to share a 'panini'... We ordered the proscuitto and brie. \"That sandwich is no longer on the menu\" our server tells us. What are you talking about, I think to myself, it's printed right there, stupid. Obviously it's on the menu. How about saying something like 'Oh, i'm very sorry, we're out of that one. maybe you'd like the _____ instead.' But I said Ok, we'll take the meatball sub.   Big mistake.  First of all, it had very marginal flavor. The 'meatball' was more like a mushy sausage patty than a meatball. The red sauce was equally flavorless and I only knew it has cheese because I could see it. No taste there either.  AND it was certainly not a panini, which should be pressed and grilled. This was more like a toasted sandwich. Im sure Quiznos has a better one, anyway.  The garlic fries would have been wonderful if they were not served cold. 80 degrees is perfect for San Diego, not frenchies. I would have sent for some fresh ones, but our server might as well have been David Copperfield's sister, as good as she was at vanishing. We got the bill, and I was surprised to see that Sarie's cup of coffee cost about as much as a footlong meatball sub at Subway (which is where we should have gone in the first place). Started feeling sick on the way home (although that might've been due to last night's festivities, which included copious amounts of liquid courage and about 65 cubic yards of mentholated smoke). Oh, and the groupon isn't even good until tomorrow, so now I'll have to go back, although I really don't want to. But when I do, it'll be for 2 bottles of La Folie and some hot garlic fries. All in all, this was a terrible way to spend $20 and an hour of our time. Blah food, blah service, blah blah blah. I'm giving it 2 stars only because of the great beer list and clean atmosphere. Thanks you guys. Always a pleasure telling you how it is.",

    "text": "I tried this the other night, and I had mixed feelings. My friend and I ordered the Mama's Garlic Bread with Melted Cheese on top. It was $6.95 for the garlic bread and an additional $1.95 for the cheese. It came out with 4 small pieces of bread. I guess that's the price that you pay for dining in a casino. They had a huge garlic clove where you could squeeze on top of the bread. The garlic clove itself was really good. We ordered the Choked Pig pizza which was pretty good. It had an aioli pesto, mozzarello cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, bacon, artichoke mix, and whiskey sour cream drizzled onto the pizza and topped with basil. I liked the flavoring of the pizza. It was awesome. My friend covered his pizza with the chili peppers because he thought it had no taste. I hadn't noticed it until my friend mentioned it, but the pizza was so difficult to chew. My mouth hurt so much. The pizza was really tough. I prefer chewy pizza to crunchy pizza.",

    "text": "The pizza was adequate: not bad, but definitely not great.  I ordered the garlic bread because some raved about it on Yelp, but after trying it I have no idea why anybody recommended it.  It could have easily been called \"greasy bread\" instead of \"garlic bread\".  It was just THIN slices of Italian bread with some garlic butter smeared on it.  It was better if you took some of the fresh garlic provided with it and put it on top.  I ordered it with cheese which I thought would be a sprinkle of cheese, but turned out to be a big glob of cheese on every slice.  My stomach hurt after eating this stuff.  Some of the folks I was with said they accidentally ordered the vegan pizza earlier in the week and said they regretted it.  You are probably better off eating at Burger Bar next door.",

We were drawn in by half price cheese slices, so we walked in and got a table. They also offer half price appetizers. We decided to start with one slice each, as they are pretty big. We also wanted to try the meatball appetizer. Upon placing our order, we are told that there is a minimum of two cheese slices per person...odd! Clearly the intention is to fill you up on cheap cheese pizza so you order less of the more expensive stuff. We didn't fall for that so one of us ordered two slices and had our one slice each. How was the food? Nothing terribly special unfortunately. The cheese pizza was super salty and the meatballs while good were generic and seemed about the same caliber as the frozen variety. Would we come here again to try the actual entrees?....no, there are far many better options in the same building even.",

    "text": "I want to preface this with the following review to be a combination of both dinner and and after dinner visit for alcohol only. They must be doing something right if we went back two times in the same night, right?  Earlier in the experience I did go for dinner and once again had the hangover pizza. It didn't quite have the same flare as last time so I'm open to trying the meatball sandwich next time since from the previous experience I sampled a meatless meatball and couldn't tell the difference. Not to say that the pizza was bad this time because that's far from the truth as I found the dough very soft and light on the muffin top as I walked away!  Later on after watching Michael Jackson one we decided to come back and mosey up to the bar for some alcoholic hi-jinx. What stuck out was the Italian Creamsicle. It was what I call a sleeper drink because it goes down sweet, but once consumed takes you to an inebriated happy place. The bartender appeared like she was training, but beyond being amazingly beautiful she made sure we were always taken care of. Although the drink sounded fruity on paper with banana liqueur, orange juice, and pineapple juice she made mine a bit more heavy on the rum which I had no complaints about.  I would recommend this for a more quieter paced setting and drink selection was pretty extensive between mixed drinks and otherwise. It was reasonably priced and thankfully not overpriced compared to other places. On a plus you can shell out $14 and get a souvenir glass to take home. Cheesy and touristy in that regard, but at least it's memories nonetheless",

It's Located right next to the burger bar in the shoppes area of Mandalay bay. We made a reservation on yelp and were seated promptly.     Our server, Johanna was very helpful. We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon (yes, check them out because they are on there)! She informed us of what we needed to spend ($37.50) and went on to take our drink order. My boyfriend ordered the absolute gimlet (it sounded good, but it wasn't) and we had to send it back. We offered to pay for it, but Johanna had no problem replacing it. We decided to play it safe and just order a bottle of Pinot noir. Their wine prices on bottles are fair and they carry some very drinkable brands;)     The food... Oh my gosh! We ordered off the vegan menu (yes I said menu)! We opted for the almond pesto cauliflower, truffle sweet potato fries, and a vegan veggie pizza. Everything came out pretty quickly. Seasoned to perfection and generous portion sizes, everything tasted amazing. I can honestly say I can't find one thing to complain about. Their vegan dessert menu looked great (vegan zeppollis! Chocolates cake with pnb frosting!! Ny cheesecake!!!) but we just couldn't fit anything in. We figure it's just another very good excuse to come Back.     They have a happy hour mon-thurs from 3-6pm. Apps are half off and we were informed that their house wines were cheaper than a soda! By far one of our new go to's when we are on the strip!!",

Here's what I've had most recently:  PASTA FAGIOLI SOUP ($4.95): Progresso's canned vegetarian minestrone soup packs more flavor than what Slice of Vegas is serving up. I added Parmesan cheese, pepper, and salt to my petite bowl of soup to no avail. There simply was no saving this soup. 1/5  MEATLESS MEATBALL SUB ($13.95): Dripping with marinara, the sub was falling apart before my first bite. I'm already a messy eater- I don't need help. Meatballs were tasty though. 3/5 PRO TIP: You get to add a flavor (such as garlic-rosemary) to your fries at no cost! Fries were on point.   ZEPPOLI ($7.95): Truthfully, I enjoyed Olive Garden's Zeppoli better. The dough was thick and super chewy, giving my jaw a workout. The added Cinnamon was an unexpected flavor, but the zeppoli just failed to deliver. 2/5  PRICE: On our last visit, dinner for two (even with 2 draft beers) came to $13 pre-tip after the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate. 5/5, especially for the Strip!  AMBIANCE: It's usually noisy here, especially when you're seated towards the back of the restaurant. Decor sticks to a red and black palette and the restaurant has fun fixtures on the wall (like a bike!). Music goes between country and low-key rock. 4/5  CUSTOMER SERVICE: Average. 3.5/5  PROS: Vegan Menu and affordability CONS: No bathroom in the restaurant, mostly underwhelming food  Return Visit? For now, I've had my fill of Slice of Vegas. The only thing that has impressed me are the fries.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #29",

Filled us up. Only thing is the price, cost $40, but...seems okay by Vegas means. The atmosphere is chill. They have different TVs with different sports games on, something my boyfriend enjoyed. They have a large variety of Vegan options. They even have a Vegan happy hour. When we left I saw they had a walk-up for ordering slices on the go. Overall, it being my first time here, I really liked this place.",

Pizza was really good, my salad was phenomenal and Amanda our waitress was very friendly and helpful. If it hadn't been for my wife being persistent about eating here, based off the hostess I would have went elsewhere, it was like a movie I seen recently where the restaurant ppl is empty and she's telling you it's a 20 minute wait but seats others that walk up while we stand there and wait. Then she thought she was a prom queen or something, it was a very awkward.",

Beyond burger was delicious and came with a lot of fries (Tip: ask for fries no salt, thank me later LOL). YUM. Cooked awesomely and had a lot of flavaaaa. Skipped dessert because we were stuffed and had plenty of left overs, but totally recommend.  I do love that Jennifer also mentioned the yelp check in for free fries etc, but we were stuffed AF but cool!   We will be back!",

Everything Was So Good. Our Waitress Was Johnna, And She Was Extremely Nice. She Always Came By To See If We Needed Anything Or If We Where Okay. Also, There Was A Magician, I Believe His Name Was Zac, He Did A Little Show ... And Then Went Around Peoples Table Doing Some Entertainment. He Came To Our Table, We Had A Great Time With Him. He Told Us Jokes, Did Some Tricks And Told Us Stories. I Thought That Was Cool. Everyone Was Nice. The Restuarnt Was Clean And It Wasn't Too Busy. Which Was Nice And Calm.

Both times the wait to sit was entirely too long, so I opted for the to-go bar area instead. I will say that having this little bar area is great for people who want their food without waiting for a seat.   The quality of the pizza is only so/so (it's a bit too greasy for my taste), and the ready slices taste kinda stale. Definitely opt for making your own pizza if you have the time/money/friends to eat with you (because the pizza size is actually decent).   As far as trying anything else, I've only had the 'Not Your Mama's Garlic Bread' - which was a let-down (not very garlic-y).   Oh also, this place isn't cheap - but where in Vegas is?? But there is a saving grace - it's right next to a Fat Tuesday's - SCORE!",

After politely bringing it to the bartenders attention she quickly took it off the plate and threw it away; immediately went, and started speaking to a manager on the other side of the bar. A few moments later, said manager approaches and casually asks about how the appetizer was, while feigning ignorance.  After explaining to her about the tin foil she replied that they cook it in tin foil and that it was perfectly normal.  I told her to make sure it doesn't happen to any other customers as it is \"not perfectly normal\"  That was the end of that.  No compensation.  No apologies.  No nothing. Just your typical Las Vegas customer service that we've all grown so accustomed to.  The bill was around 100$ for 2 drinks an appetizer and two entrees.  You decide if this is a place you want to eat at.",

I don't like \"fast food\" pizza (Pizza Hut etc.) but honestly, this pizza was worse.",

    "text": "I came here on a recommendation from a fellow vegan friend. After reading the reviews, I was unsure what to think. We were immediately seating and helped fast by not only one waitress but 2. Service was impeccable.   Food. There is a whole back side of the menu that has vegan options. And here's a tip: from 3-6 they have vegan happy hour appetizers. Yay us! The menu is plentiful with so many options I had no clue what to order. Normally I have 1 option to choose from and that makes it easy but I had about 20+ options to choose from.   We started with the vegan hummus which was very good. The roasted peppers and crispy chick peas on the center were the best. I ordered the vegan hamburger and sweet potato fries. The burger was amazing! It had all the fixings. Vegan cheese and mayo as well as everything else on a normal hamburger. The taste was great, I only wish I hadn't scarfed down all the hummus because I was kind of full. It was a lot of food!   My coworkers ordered a pizza and chicken parm. Both seemed pleased with the options. It not over the top about them.   All in all, great place to enjoy! I will say that the options they had on the menu are great but all things I can make from the comfort of my own home and when I got out to eat I like to eat things new. Restaurants that have only 1 vegan option usually have a good choice and something you wouldn't normally have. So although there is a lot of variety, these are things you would have access to at the grocery store or home.   Happy to see more restaurants offering vegan options!!",

It comes with a bulb of roasted garlic that you squeeze out the soften cloves and spread it on the toasty bread on top of the almond pesto. Perfection for my taste buds! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kssXHi&s=03625814fa9fbfec8217ce12488922149179c89d59e0a32972862ba686185936\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kssXHi</a>  We also got an order of the Shoestring Sweet Potato Fries. It comes with options of seasoning. We went truffle style. I'm still undecided if I like the taste of truffle oil with sweet potato. This comes with a side of vegan ranch. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2jXTjNG&s=d09f181aa9366513e3183e2601137ee31a1926a0065b575fc17098413e3d516d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2jXTjNG</a>  The Back East Buffalo Pizza sounded unique to me. Gardein chick'n, celery, carrots, buffalo sauce and vegan ranch sounds like a good combination of flavors but I don't think I was digging it in pizza form as much as I thought I would. I think it was the pizza sauce mixed with those flavors. Doubt I would order this again but I could see how others might like it. One thing I did appreciate was the thin crust. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kTQFNb&s=ec04751dc3224dcdbd953b9b22c1daff7eea3d5a621d3e3d2b9e7a24f621cdb8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kTQFNb</a>  Service was great! Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Food came out quick. I'd probably come back to check out the other items on the vegan menu. I mean, their two vegan desserts sound amazing: Chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting and fried pizza dough balls tossed in cinnamon and sugar. Yes please :)",

The staff there is amazing (Johnna is our favorite!!!) and the people watching is fun.  The reason for my mediocre review? They've instituted hiring magicians to \"work\" the crowd. It is the most bizarre decision their management has ever made and I feel it may be hurting their business. We were in on Saturday night and the crowd was sparse. We were sitting close enough to his \"performance\" to smell the excelerant... not what you want while dining. When he came up to talk to us about his show, I reminded him that we're locals and would prefer to dine alone. We've witnessed him hanging out at tables full of people trying to be polite but getting annoyed.  During the week it's a \"close up magic\" magician who does card/coin tricks. We've gotten to the point that we tell our servers to tell the magician to just by-pass our table when he's making the rounds.  By the time we enjoy our drinks/food, our tab is always over $100 and we always take care of our server. I would prefer to not feel pressured to tip entertainment that is not only distracting, but just plain unneccessary.   I hope the management reconsiders their distraction before we decide to take our business elsewhere. We'd miss you terribly.",

It was wonderful, and I couldn't have had a better pasta dish if I'd been in Italy. Our server was the friendliest young woman, and very attentive. We liked it so much that we went again for our last night there. We had the same server, and this time I got the chicken parm. It was great, and since I knew nothing would be open at the airport at 5 am, I was able to have the leftovers for breakfast.",

    "text": "I am going to rate their Vegan Pizza because they are one of only 2 places that serve vegan pizza in Vegas ( that I know of)   To start, I am dumbfounded that other places don't offer it. All they have to do is use a different cheese and charge a premium for it. Not like they have to change all ingredients in making the pizza. So I am very glad this place allows me to come with my friends and we are all able to get something to eat.   I tried their Vegan Supreme Pizza. I have to say that while vegan pizza will probably never be as good as the \"real thing\", this rates a solid 7/10.   The dough is very good, the sauce used was not that bad ( a little too thick for my personal taste but good nevertheless) the cheese used I believe is regular Daiya, which vegans have a love or hate relationship with. It's not my cheese of choice for pizzas I make at home but it's decent.   The only con is the price. It is quite expensive, I ended up paying about $35 after taxes for an 18\".    I understand they charge a solid $7-8 premium on top of the vegan pizzas, and again, no complaints at all, at least they're giving us an option. BUT it's not like I can go there every weekend and grab a pizza, so unfortunately the price is much higher than i'd expect to pay for a pizza.   Very decent taste. Very Expensive as well. Will I go back?  On rare occasions due to the price. But I can see myself trying their other flavors.",

My friend, who suffers from celiac, and I went because the online menu advertises a gluten free pizza. We were so excited! Unfortunately, as soon as the server found out my friend has celiac, he told us that they cannot promise the food has not come in contact with the flour in the air from the other pizza crust and there could be cross-contamination.  (This information is also posted on the restaurant menu.) My friend, who does not seem to have issues with trace amounts of wheat, decided it was worth the risk. Before we could start ordering again, the server left the table to get the manager. The manager came back and told us \"we do not recommend\" people with celiac eat here... and continued with what the server said then simply waited for us to leave. He didn't ask if we understood the risk or if we were ok with this possibility of cross- contamination. We were just excused. Even as I started to explain that we understood and it was ok he just stood there waiting for us to leave. It was so rude. We have been all over vegas and had so many people go out of their ways to make sure we had an amazing experience and felt comfortable eating there. This was such a shock to the experience. He made us feel so uncomfortable and so unwelcome.  I understand he needs to take care of his restaurant but at the end of the day, he should not be kicking people out because of a health condition. So very unprofessional.",

We weren't too hungry so it was perfect to split between 2 people as a snack. Service was mediocre but at least we got steady refills on our water.   The good thing is that they're open late when nearly everything else in Mandalay Place is closed. I would only come here again for happy hour, otherwise this place is way too pricey for what you get. So many other pizza joints you can hit up that have better pizza and more reasonable pricing!",

In town for a conference at the Mandalay Bay, we wanted to try someplace inside the hotel complex and avoid walking in the 100 degree plus heat. The menu looked pretty good, so why not give it a try?  The food was pretty good, and I would go back again if I find myself in Las Vegas again.  I had the soup with sausage in it - sorry, forgot the name - and it is a much better version that the similar soup from Olive Garden.  The cheesesteak sandwhich was tasty, although a couple of pieces of the steak were a bit chewy.  Nice thin fries with the meal.  The others had pasta, which you can build by picking the pasta, sauce, and proteins, and they looked very good.  Like any good Italian restaurant, there was more than enough pasta for a meal.  Slice of Vegas offers desserts, and they sound pretty good. However, we were too full from the meal.  Maybe next time.  I would go back again and try the pizza because the selection is fairly wide.",

The noodles were DRENCHED in oil, it was kinda gross. This is the only time I have never liked pesto sauce!!  I ordered the blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were yummy and the burger was alright. The meat was kind of dry but all the other addings made it a pretty tasty burger.  The one cool thing here though is the big glass beer taps you can order and have placed on your table! It is a glass tube that's probably yard size with its own tap on the bottom so you can pour your own glass. Very awesome if you want some beer to go with your pizza or burger!  I'd really only eat here if I was staying in the Mandalay Bay and wanted to eat somewhere convenient. Otherwise, it's kind of pricy for the quality but they do give you huge portions! However, they're not to die for leftovers. There is no 'wow' factor with the food here but it's decent Italian food for a decent price. There's soo much better in Vegas though. If you're only here for the weekend, I'd try something else!",

Because it was busy we were seated at the bar. Side note: the bar stools aren't very comfy on the ole' back.   I opted to \"make my own\" pizza while my girlfriend went for the \"Greek\". I'd say it took slightly longer than average for the pies to come out. And they were just ok... not bad, not great, just ok.  I will say that I never could have imagined that a gyro inspired pizza would be good, but it was definitely the better of the two.   I should also warn that their sausage is very very very very finely ground.  Why is that important? It reminded me of the cheap stuff on the $1 frozen mini pizzas I ate in college when I was broke. No me gusta.   Like I said: not bad, not good, just ok for what the place is...",

It was a Saturday night and the place wasn't too packed.  There were a few booths available but they sat us in one of those booth/chair combo tables where a bunch of tables are lined up in front of one long booth.  I explain this because it becomes an issue later on.    We ordered drinks (good selection of beers.  My husband was happy to get Magic Hat #9).  We chose Mamma's Garlic Bread as an appetizer.  When it came out, the runner was going around to each table asking if it was theirs.  Ahh!  I want my garlic bread, come here!  Served on a small pan with a roasted garlic head.  Interesting and kind of waste of a garlic head if you ask me but I'm only a moderate garlic lover, not a garlic-loving freak who needs a side of garlic head lol.  But the bread was pretty good.    For dinner I ordered a bowl of pasta(bilities) (haha, cute.  Yes, I'm easily amused) and chose rigatoni with the spicy marinara sauce.  The server asked me if I wanted to add a side of meatballs or a salad and I said no.  My husband ordered the meatball hero which came with fries, and he substituted regular for garlic shoestring fries.  I'm so glad he did - they were delicious.  Anyway, my meal arrived with 2 meatballs on either side of it.  I didn't order meatballs so I just scooped them off on to a side plate.  (Not a vegetarian, I just don't like things that are too \"meaty\".  heh.  I just walked into a bunch of one-liners, I'm sure.  But you know what I mean.)  The server apologized and offered to bring me a new bowl of pasta if I was a vegetarian.  I told her there was no need for a new bowl, but I was glad she offered.   The marinara sauce wasn't bad but it tasted as though a lot of red pepper was the only reason it was \"spicy\" and not regular marinara sauce.  My husband enjoyed his meatball hero.  For dessert we had the sack of dough balls.  I thought these were going to be lighter, like zeppoles.  They could have been a lot more enjoyable if they had more cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on the outside and they didn't pour so much sea salt over the chocolate/hazelnut sauce.   We're nearing the end of our meal and they seat a family of five right next to us... in a table of 4.  They did this on the side we were sitting on so a young boy wound up sitting RIGHT next to me as though we were in the same group.  This really didn't bother me except I thought that if I were that family I'd be pretty pissed that one of the kids has to sit in between two different tables.  We were almost done - they could have had the family wait 10 minutes to put two tables together.  And of course, I had to slide to the other side of my table to exit, which was only a small inconvenience but just made me annoyed that they would consider this setup in the first place.    The prices were not over the top, but you just don't get enough \"wow\" for your money here.  A single cheese slice (which I didn't try) is $4.95.  The decor is very hip and environment is pretty chill.  There is an internet juke box and the music playing was very good.  Some classic rock and you could tell the bartenders skip over songs they don't like.  It could be good or bad depending on who's listening.    Overall we probably wouldn't choose to come back unless we were in Mandalay Bay with others who wanted to try this place.  It was a decent one-time thing.  If you're there and you're feeling it, give it a shot.",

    "text": "When we were making last minute plans to take my cousins to Vegas, I prayed and I hoped that we could find an affordable room at the Wynn (vegan paradise!), but with the cheapest clocking in at $900/night (*SOB*), it just wasn't going to happen this time.  So we booked at the Mandalay, knowing there'd at least be the best pool in the world to soothe the pain of not being at the Wynn.  What I didn't know was that there'd also be Slice of Vegas to make me SO SO happy!  It's a casual Italian eatery, and coming from the suburbs of Philly, I felt right at home.  Nothing fancy, not too much hoopla, just standard American-Italian fare that fills your belly with a warm light (and maybe acid reflux) that you'll carry with you for the rest of the day.  This, my friends, is comfort food.  What sets Slice of Vegas apart from the pizza joints of my youth is their amazing vegan menu!  Not even kidding you, it has everything you could possibly ever want at a place like this.  Pizza, pasta, salads (really? you're eating a salad?), appetizers, sandwiches, DESSERTS.....oh lordy, they thought of everything.  They left no stone unturned.  I was lured by the meatball sandwich, and went high to hog heaven with the first bite.  A great roll (they even call it a hoagie roll, like my people back east!!), a rich balanced sauce, the perfect amount of daiya mozzarella, and gardein meatballs, which are probably my favorite outside of homemade.  It came with sweet potato fries, and our darling waitress said the magic words, \"Would you like a side of ranch with that?\"  WOULD I?!  Gimme gimme gimme.  Sam was perfectly content with his spaghetti and spicy marinara, and would've come back for it every meal if I'd let him.  We stuffed ourselves silly and had no room for dessert, which was the saddest thing.  I even tried to come back later after a night of dancing, but they were long closed.  Alas, I can add this place to my repertoire of super vegan friendly restaurants in Vegas, and I'm very happy that I don't absolutely have to go to the Wynn to be well fed (to the point of bursting).",

The wait was minimal, although I was surprised that there was a wait at all on a Monday.   Once seated, our waiter slash bartender was extremely attentive and friendly. He didn't even give me a snarky look when I mentioned I had a Groupon, kudos for that. I ordered the gnocchi with alfredo sauce and my fella got the barbecue chicken pizza. He really enjoyed his pizza, despite the $19 price tag for a single serving. My gnocchi wasn't bad for price and taste. I would probably order it again, since it's not too expensive. The food didn't blow me away, but it was solid and service amped up the star-rating on this review a bit too.   I probably won't go out of my way to go back to Slice of Vegas, but if you're in the area and craving a slice of 'za and beer, this place is for you.",

The crust is actually not bad but overall the food was just \"Meh\"   I did like the fact that the caesar salad came with broccolini which I haven't seen before. I always like more vegetables in my salads so this was a welcomed addition.  It will do if you want something quick and cheap(er) - but other than that there is no reason to come here.",

Her salad looked good but didn't taste very good after I had coated my mouth in barbecue sauce! She loved it though. I thought my pizza was great. Both my mom and sister enjoyed the non-vegan garlic bread and my mom seemed to enjoy her non-vegan pizza slices. I wanted an order of the vegan bread but knew I wouldn't have room. Things have sure changed a lot vegan-wise since I was last in Las Vegas in 2003! Slice of Vegas was great and worth the walk and tram ride over to Mandalay Bay.",

I made a reservation but I think it was kind of slow. When we walked up, it looked completely crazy but I think a big party was waiting to be sat.   Our server was friendly and efficient so no complaints there. We ordered calamari and an 18\" ham and pineapple pizza. Everything was really yum. The ONLY complaint I have is that the pizza could've used a bit more cheese. The crust though, omg. I LOVE thin crust pizza but hate how sometimes it gets too soggy or other times it's too crispy like a cracker. This crust was just perfect. It was crispy on the bottom, but soft and chewy on top. If the pizza had more cheese, it would have been AMAZING and deserving of 5 stars. I'd like to go back and next time request extra cheese.  Also, I got the berry martini and it was TINY and tasted like juice. At $10 a pop, I'd skip the drinks.",

The pizza crust isn't my favorite.   Maybe a little too much like cardboard (lacking a bit of flavor and kind of dry) but it served its purpose and I enjoyed my pizza.  The vegan Alfredo was delicious!  Very creamy and it did not have that sulphur smell/ taste that some cauliflower items tend to have.   I don't like replacement meat so I did not enjoy the \"chicken\" but I'm sure others would.   Also, it's not advertised but the chocolate cake on the dessert menu is vegan as well.   Delicious!   I live in Vegas so I try not to eat on the Strip but I will say this is a great place to come to when attending an event at Mandalay bay.",

It is very easy to get to while at Mandalay Bay and it appears to be open late night. The pizza is ready to go - just pick your slice and they will heat it up.  It is decent quality and size, but not a tremendous deal.  My slice of meat lovers had plenty of meat and a nice crust.  I bought a slice, a water and a coke and it was like $20.  I am guessing the slice is like $10 at that total- not much for what you pay!",

I keep coming back for 2 reasons: it's open late and it's walking distance for me.  Their pizza is thin crust, but I've never been satisfied by their crunchless crust. It's never crispy. The portion sizes are huge, but that comes hand in hand with their high pricing. I mean, $30 for an 18 inch with sparse toppings is a bit much, isn't it? Even by Vegas standards? Plus, their little wings are $12! $12! For 7 pieces! (Side note: 7 is a weird number, so they either gave me an extra or I got gypped.) Sure, it came with like 5 sticks of carrots and celery, but $12?!  Service is okay. I tried to redeem the yelp check-in for free fries, but they told me it was for dine-in only. I didn't read the offer carefully, so it was my bad. They gave me a free cup for water (normally $.50) while I was waiting though.  Will I be back? Probably, and I'm still going to be complaining to myself the whole time.",

The truffle fries are so perfect, and my boyfriend and I enjoyed their BBQ chicken pizza!  They have some great happy hour deals, but unfortunately the shots aren't cheaper (or even available) without the light up shot glass. Grab a beer, pizza, fries, and stuff yourself silly! This restaurant is extremely affordable and in a hallway with other cute little shops. Gamble between Mandalay Bay and Luxor while you're there :)",

The crust was thin, crisp on the outside with a little bit of chew in the center = yummy. The pepperoni had a strong great flavor but I think it needed just a little more sauce and cheese to help the flavors marry.   It would definitely be a place to come back and try a whole, freshly baked pizza.",

It has a sports bar vibe to it and the front of the restaurant is completely open so you can see into the mall walkway and folks can see in. I'd had breakfast not too long before so I didnt want anything heavy. Luckily they can do pizza by the slice, and they also had a check-in offer for a free side of garlic parm fries.  Ordered an Ace Pineapple Ale (bottle), pepperoni slice (thin crust) and the garlic parm fries for the check-in offer. Loved my drink, and the pizza was pretty tasty, but the star of the day were those garlic parm fries! And to think they were a check in offer!! Those things will have you ordering another helping! I mean it's a really good size serving, but they are deliciously crisp and fresh and they somehow are able to get garlic AND parmesan cheese all over each fry without getting them soggy! I could not stop popping those delicious little slivers in my mouth!",

Couldn't really answer any questions but stated it's because she had been off for a few days okay fine. But we ordered the garlic bread and added the mozzarella for $2 and ya know it was delicious it was good even though the garlic bulb was burnt and yes it was bitter but 9$ for 4 thin sliced peices of bread and cheese? Felt like that was too expensive. The meatballs was definitely amazing, even coming out of the kitchen cold the flavor was still on point and melt in your mouth and the sauce tasted super fresh. Also ordered a 4 cheese pizza and this whole as a meal was completely amazing flavor wise. Will deff come back here next time were in Vegas!",

    "text": "We were at Mandalay Bay for a convention and were looking for dinner and a drink away from the large crowds so we picked this place. We arrived with a large group that was separated into 3 separate tables. It was a Wednesday evening and not too crowded, especially compared to some of the surroundings bars and restaurants; half of the tables were empty. The reason I am giving 2 stars was the AWFUL service. I didn't catch the name of our waitress (heavy set, light skinned, maybe in her 20s or 30s, dark blonde or light brown ponytail) because she never gave it and seemed REALLY annoyed that there was such a large group. Her face was blatantly annoyed. She never greeted us or welcomed us or smiled. She came and got our drink orders and when she brought them to our tables she slammed the drinks in front of us and stormed off. She never asked us if we needed anything else or if we were ready to order. A few minutes later, we were still waiting to order our food, I flagged her over so we could order and she shook her head in an annoyed manner. It was very clear and I saw her reaction. When she arrived at our table she pulled her notepad out and said in a very annoyed manner, \"so are you guys gonna order food, or...\" and she gestured with her face and hands in the \"c'mon, let's go\" manner. We had been sitting for about 20 minutes at that point. I looked at her and said, \"yes please we would very much like to order but have been waiting on you.\" She realized that I picked up on her animosity and seemed to readjust her attitude. We ordered and the food was good and came quickly. We decided we did not want to continue giving our business here after we ate our food. We asked for the check and tip was already included. I believe in being an honest and fair tipper, but based off our waitress, I did not believe she deserved a tip. We had been in Vegas for the whole week for work and were paying on the company card so we have been very generous with our business and tips all week, but this place was not deserving of a penny more. I would not recommend to anyone.",

We were greeted with welcoming smiles and seated quickly, which is rare when a restaurant is about to close. The menu had changed since my last visit but they still accommodated my request even though it wasn't an option anymore. My waitress was pleasant and very attentive. Then all of a sudden you could see a lot of movement of the staff and the gate of the restaurant went down. That's when I noticed something was wrong but the staff appeared cool, calm and collected. I asked \"are we locked in here?\" They provided us with all of the information they knew and said we were on lock down due to a shooting. The news will tell you the details of the attack, but I will tell you the details of my experience at Slice of Vegas. 1) the manager Joe was on top of things 2) I truly felt like we were in the safest place in the casino as other establishments kicked their guests out into the chaos 3) The establishment did not charge anyone for their meals because their priority was our safety 4) They offered their employee restroom to us so we wouldn't be in any danger or have to leave 5) They stayed with us the entire time even when they had access to their personal vehicles during a terrorist attack they stayed ensuring we made it to safety. The owner and other high level staff came to the scene and assisted the police department in making sure we were safe and could get home risking their lives for their customers. Never have I had a more positive or memorable dining experience. I will return to tip the staff and Slice of Vegas will forever have a spot in my heart.",

Atmosphere was of course great being that the restaurant resides within the mall area of the Mandalay Bay. Still, food was just there to fulfill the formality of stifling hunger. Nothing real special that made the place unique.",

The crust, sauce and cheese or ok.  The pizza comes covered in several different meats.  You get a good amount of toppings.  There are other options as well if you are not in the mood for pizza.  This place is realistically a three star.  I am taking away one star for one petty thing that annoys me.  They offer a 10\" pizza as well.  That would have been the preferred size for me, but it is only available in gluten-free.  I am not sure why I cannot get what I want just because hypochondriacs found a new \"allergy\".  Evidently lactose intolerance is no longer in so they needed a new go to issue.",

I was so surprised when I turned the menu over and there was a whole separate vegan section! They offer meatless meatballs and chicken strips (both gardein) as well as Daiya cheese. They had a number of appetizers, pizza selections and even desserts! I ordered the bbq chicken pizza and it was delicious!! I wish I could have ordered more (especially dessert) but I had a flight to catch.",

Where They Excel: Service - we had a male server the first night and Franni (maybe Fani, can't remember her name) at the bar the two second times... they were both fantastic... particularly the bartender, engaging but not over bearing, attentive and made a great moscow mule... food always came out promptly and food runners did a great job... TV's are plentiful so its a great spot to just sit at the bar, drink and watch some games..  Food - awesome. We had the buffalo pizza, the bbq one, pasta, garlic bread and a  custom made noodle combo.. all vegan, all delicious... the roasted cloves of garlic on the garlic bread were amazing... pro tip, get the buffalo sauce and throw it on the garlic and pesto bread... you're welcome...  There really isn't anywhere they don't excel... this place was great... the non vegan stuff actually looked really good as well and I didn't see too many dissastisfied customers... definitely recommend..",

I'm not sure if but I thought I saw a full bar.  We ordered an order of Not Your Mama's Garlic Bread and WOWOWOWOWOWOWWWW it was sooooo good! The pesto on it was perfect (not too much) and the whole clove of roasted garlic on the side...I ate almost the whole thing by myself. I saved the last of it to spread on my pizza and I even squished out the last tiny bit and licked it off my finger...yep it was that good!  Hubby and I ordered an 18\" Vegan Faux Pie and let me tell you...it was perfect. Not toooo much cheese. Even though I'm not a huge fan of Daiya cheese I really liked it on this pizza because they did not use too much. Sometimes it can get all goopey if your not careful with it. The veggies were cooked perfect and the sauce was seasoned perfect and I liked the little kick that it had to it. I was excited that we had a bunch of pieces left over :)  I convinced our friend to trade me one of his vegan buffalo pizza pieces and it was super duper good also. I just really liked our veggie pizza better and I'm trying to limit my soy meat products right now.  Our service was perfect and with our large group...we have zero complaints! I can't wait to go back and try some of those yummmmmmmy vegan sandwiches on the menu.  Yummmmmmm!",

My friend and I were so drunk; almost felt like this place was a mirage except when we clutched the wall, IT WAS REAL! We did the drunk girl excitement and raised our hands to the Italian Gods for creating pizza dough!   Before the waitress said anything, she knew we needed a reservoir of H2O. We finally choose to go with the Back East Buffalo Pizza & devoured it in minutes! I'm not that big fan of thin crust because sometimes it's so thin you can't put any yummy toppings on their without falling off or the crust gets burnt, but this crust was to die for (and that's not the tequila talking)! Although the prices may seem high, it's Vegas!! I rather pay more money for quality than have a free nasty meal!   A good side effect of a thin crust pizza is it's enough to soak up the alcohol, but doesn't make you feel all bloated and nasty and lethargic, so you can still get into your skank dress and not feel like a sausage!",

We decided to stop by the quick side and order a couple of slices to dine at the counter.  It's a typical \"order by the slice\" joint....you select your Pizza slice and they re-heat it and call your number to pick it up.  We ordered 2 slices of Cheese Pizza. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slice-of-vegas-las-vegas?select=e7il4LoTHrBJ4bjvybT2CA#e7il4LoTHrBJ4bjvybT2CA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/slic...</a>  It didn't take too long for the Pizza to be ready.  The Pizza itself was forgettable though.  It was a little Salty and lacked flavor beyond the Salt.  The Crust was a bit like cardboard, very tough.....there's a difference between chewy and tough....I like chewy, but dislike \"tough\" dough.  Overall, we felt like we wasted calories.  Return Factor - 10%",

I've tried the barbecue \"chicken\" pizza and the vegan burger with a heap of sweet potato fries, which were all excellent. I finally managed to save room for the vegan chocolate cake (with peanut butter frosting!!!) the last time I went, and it was AMAZING! I want to eat it every day, for every meal, but then someone would have to roll me around like Violet Beauregarde.  Our server on this most recent visit, Brent, was super nice, too. He got a big tip. :)",

    "text": "After 2 days of heavy drinking, a group of 4 dudes (Mr. Bloewen, Mr. Booth, Mr. Buxton, and myself) were looking for an early lunch.  We teetered on an all you can drink buffet and Mandalay, but though for the better to avoid that.  After Buxton was refused service at Burger Bar the night before, we elected to try out the nearby Slice of Vegas.  We were unsure of what to order, and our waiter was hard to find.  We were the only people in the establishment, since they just opened, but the waiter was either busy playing with his phone in the back, or just didn't want to talk to us.  We had to yell at him everytime to finish talking as he quickly was walking away.  We ordered an appetizer of french fries that were good and hot.  We were all in the mood for pizza so asked the waiter what size we should order.  We are 4 average built guys.  His response was, \"I've seen some people eat a large all by themselves, and some split it with 4-5 people.\"  Gee, thanks a lot, Guy.  Without any help, we tried ordering the large pepperoni, and know we could order more if that was not enough.  If you are in doubt, I will say that it is more than enough for 4 dudes.  We were all stuffed, and didn't even finish one piece.  The pizza was also extremely greasy, and completely mediocre.  I think that I have to say Domino's is better than the Slice of Vegas.  I am highly doubtful for the continued existence of this restaurant, and assume that it will be replaced (go out of business) soon.  If the quality was higher, i would be more hopeful.",

Everyone had different items but I had the roasted cauliflower and a side salad as my meal. The roasted cauliflower was quite flavorful for a pizza place and I wish I had ordered another one. My friends Salmon left something to be desired however and we sent back the first one as it was way over cooked. The second one came out better but we learned our lesson, do not order a fish dish at a pizza place even i they advertise it. All in all, everyone else seemed to enjoy the rest of there meals and drinks. I am sure that when I  am back in Vegas again for work, I will be heading up to slice for either pizza or just the roasted cauliflower.",

    "text": "Taste-wise, this place deserves 3 stars, I've definitely had better. However, since it's on the strip, the price was very decent and the service was excellent. It's located next to Burger Bar and Hussongs in Mandalay Bay. The have a sit down restaurant as well as take away, where you can order 1 slice. If you sit at the bar, it's a 2 slice minimum and slices are $5 each. If you order from either of these places, the pizza slices are not necessarily fresh. Sitting in the restaurant will guarantee a freshly made pizza. We sat in the restaurant and ordered a 12\" pizza, plain. The menu has some sandwiches and salads and a design your own pasta choice. It was Sunday and they also have a brunch menu. The service was excellent. Our server was attentive and gave us some free dippings for our pizza, Parmesean cheese, ranch and blue cheese dressings. The pizza was eh. I am not a fan of dried oregano and man, they use A LOT of it. I like a sweeter sauce and no dried spices. But, the cheese was good and it wasn't greasy at all.  It was $16 and change for a decent size pizza on the strip, not to bad. Just wish it tasted it better. I dont know that I'd go back, but I wouldn't say never. If you dont want to spend an arm and a leg and dont mind dried oregano on your pizza, you might want to try this place.",

We ordered 2 beers and she came back shortly there after.  Simple order, basic 3 topping pizza.    Pizza came very quickly brought out by the kitchen, asked if we needed anything else.. Told him plates and silverware would be nice.  Bartender comes over and throws down 2 plates...  Pizza was actually very good, sausage, chicken, pepperoni, nice crust sauce not too sweet.   Price was kind of high, $38 for a 12\" 3 topping pizza, a Peroni and a Stella. Asked once for the check, not sure if she didn't hear us or just wasn't up to customer service this evening, never asked how anything was.  Lucky we had cash or we may still be waiting.   Bottom line, would go back for the pizza, but horrible customer service by the bartender on a slow night and a bit pricey.",

The buffalo chicken one had an interesting taste, but I was still hungry. Then we got the check. They automatically charged 18% gratuity on the check. I saw they automatically charged 20% for parties of 8 or more so beware. Our 18 inch buffalo chick pizza and 18 inch pepperoni pizza came out to about $50 even though we had a Groupon for $20 for $40. The automatic gratuity came out to be just as much as a pizza!

    "text": "Making food choices while is Vegas is daunting; there are so many great places to choose from. This pizza shop is actually inside a mall, which made it a little difficult to park and find at first. Once inside the mall, it was super easy to find and it stuck out.  The hostesses were very nice, as was the female server we had. The boy and I ordered salads...just kidding! What do you think we ordered? Pizza of course! We opted for the 18 inch 'Choked Pig' which had pesto aioli sauce, mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, a bacon and artichoke mix, then basil on top. This pizza was delicious; and HUGE! I think we ended up saving 4 pieces which equated to a whole 'nother meal which was awesome. This size pizza was roughly $30 but they also have a 12 inch for $19, or a 10 inch gluten free for $17. I would have loved to try the gluten-free, and it's awesome they actually offer it.  For dessert, we order the cannolis. The best I've ever had was up north in New England, but these were a close second! You can tell they know how to make em because they only fill them RIGHT after you order them. Lots of places keep them filled and this results in a soggy outside. These were yummy with pistachios, chocolate chips, and chocolate sauce and were nice and crunchy!  Oh, I also had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> voucher and we were able to use it. I think we ended up having to order a coffee or something so we could reach the certain amount of money we were supposed to spend, then we got a certain amount off. Pretty cool! They are very willing to accept anything from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>.

Prices are high but its the strip so I guess that is expected. $18 for a 12 inch cheese pizza is kind of ridiculous but again, being that it's in the Luxor, you know you are overpaying to begin with.   Pizza: pretty damn good. It's not what I normally get, which is traditional cheese NY pizza but this is the type of pizza that is great if you get some toppings. We enjoyed it and would definitely get it again.   Salad: perfect amount of dressing to veggies. Tasty and fresh.  Overall: if you are in the Luxor this is a good option. Would I go back just to eat here again, probably not. But if I was over this way, I would def eat here again.",

The plan was to get a slice but when that was $6, we decided to sit and have a whole pizza instead.  A small specialty pizza with a ton of toppings was $18 opposed to 4 slices for $24.  You can't get any more toppings than their ridiculous Miles 10 Meat pizza.  That's \"made with a bolognese mix of veal, pork, and ground beef, smothered in mozzarella cheese, and topped with prosciutto, pepperoni, pancetta, sausage, bacon, mortadella and cappacola.\"  No pizza could possibly be bad when it has all this.  It was really good.  $18 for a small pizza is a little more than I want to spend but this is probably one of the cheapest places to do dinner at Mandalay Bay.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here but it's not a bad option for something casual.",

We wanted to stop by at another restaurant, but the wait was over 40 minutes at 9 pm, and we were so very hungry. So, we decided to mosey on over to Slice of Vegas. We were tempted by the stall offering small slices, but decided that we wanted to enjoy the meal sitting down.  + Meatballs: delicious with rich flavors doused in a marinara sauce. + Immortal Burger: half pound of meat. Pretty good and is pretty big for one person.  The meal was over $30 for two people, and for that price, I had hoped for fantastic food. Was it? Nah. Just a typical meal. The service was fine, and the booth was comfortable. I think it must be a Vegas thing for food to be so expensive.   *I know, I know. We didn't even order pizza, haha  Note: there are no bathrooms inside the restaurant. They're in a hallway shared by all the other tenants",

It would be great for a group of friends and they have TV's  all over so you can catch a game from any seat in the place. The hostess was friendly. The server was nice but seemed to be robotic in his approach.   It was not very busy when I dined here and service was mostly prompt. TV's were everywhere but the volume was not too loud so you can easily have conversations with your group while dining and watch the games.   The pizza was very good, NOT great but very good. Ordering a small (12') will set you back $20. It is good but not at all worth that price even being in Mandalay Place. The cocktails were well made. The presentation was weak but the flavor was perfect. The What's 6\" and hard  is cucumber Efiin and very refreshing. The Mob-a-rita is an Italian Margarita and also quite nice, They do pour a little heavy handed but the balance is still nice for the cocktails. $14 for cocktails and they are about 10 ounces.   The concept is good, the atmosphere is fun and the food is pretty good. The cocktails were the star but when considering the price of everything I can't give it more than 3 stars. It is nice to grab a bite before a show at the House of Blues or if you are shopping but it is not worth making a special trip to check out.  Much better in concept than reality.",

The wings were some of the nastiest things I've ever tasted and were left untouched without comment from the server, despite his acknowledging that we enjoyed our pizza. The pizza was good, but at 19$ for a 12 inch pizza, there are many stronger options in town. Tip, a Brita water filter cost 12$. Invest in one, your water is third world.  Overall, this is one place I will avoid with every fiber of my being.  Your TGI Fridays service cannot overcome your mediocre food, constant  skipping of music thirty seconds into a song and over playing of The Killers.",

    "text": "There seems to be some sort of hype around Las Vegas pizza joints this month, Slice of Vegas included, so my Mom and I decided to try this one out.  There was a small wait when we arrived because the place was actually pretty busy, which in my book is usually a good sign. My mom can't eat dairy products due to a food allergy, so she was asking the manager if they had a Vegan cheese they could put on the pizza. The manager actually went to the kitchen and came back with a piece of what she called \"tease\" cheese for my mom to try to see if she liked the taste before she ordered a pizza covered in it. Mom claimed it was the best Vegan cheese she has ever tasted.  We were seated and the waiter came up right away and took our drink and food order. He was a nice guy, but it was so busy that he forgot the drinks, so we flagged down another waiter to bring them for us.   We ordered a 10-meat pizza and a dish of Pappardale pasta with spicy marinara sauce. Both of the items we ordered were excellent! The pizza had a nice thin crust and wasn't overloaded with toppings to the point where you couldn't pick it up...it was perfect! Plus, they made half of the pizza with the vegan \"tease\" cheese and the other half with Mozzarella, so Mom and I could both enjoy it :) The pasta had a great flavor as well, and though it wasn't the best pasta I've ever had, it was pretty damn good.  To top it off, I had a cannoli for dessert, which was just about average :)  My major gripe with this place is the SUPER inflated prices. I understand that we're on the Strip and everything is more expensive, but $18.95 for a 12-inch pizza is pretty outrageous. The pasta dish was $14.95 and the cannoli was $6.95. Way too pricey, although the food was good and the staff were extremely nice...especially the manager!",

    "text": "If this place isn't overrated - I'm not sure what is.  I'll start by saying that I was inclined to try Slice of Vegas because of a Groupon.  As a local - it's always entertaining to spend a few hours on a Friday night at the Strip - looking at all tourists so we figured we could be entertained AND eat for cheap.   Neither one of is drinks alcohol on any regular basis so cocktails were not in the mix so thererefore cannot comment on prices.   We started our night with about a 15 min wait for a table - which really wasn't so bad.  The staff seemed friendly so I will give them a + in that department aside from the fact that our waitress was a bit peeved that I only ordered water with lemon.  As someone who tries to pay attention to the calories that I put into my body - I don't normally drink soda or juice and I'm sorry but I'm not paying $2.75 or $2.95 for water that had a Lipton tea bag in it .  There are a lot of things that I spend a lot of money on but I'm not going to be ripped off when I don't even want the item.  Had she not been peeved - she would have gotten our standard 20-25% tip.   As far as food - we ordered an antipasto app - I think it was about $11.95.  It was decently sized and had a good amount of taste but I think I'm just spoiled coming from back east.  I'm used a really hearty platter when I get an antipasto.  I am also looking for more meat and cheese in Vegas and it seems no one gets it right. In addition to the antipasto - we ordered a 12\" meat lovers pizza.  It too was tasty and I will say that it was MUCH tastier than Grimaldi's (who everyone raves about) but seriously - damn near $20 for a 12 inch pizza and $30 for a large .. You have to be joking.  There is no way in hell that I would EVER pay $30 for 16 inch pizza - I don't care what's on it.   So - all in all - for a tourist walking thru the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay dying for pizza - more power to you.  For a local - don't waste your money.  There are plenty of places in town with mediocre pizza for less money.",

This pizza place has a full vegan menu and super friendly staff. I asked for a taste of the vegan Daiya cheez so my non-vegan sister could try it before we ordered and the chef accommodated my request. Sis liked it just fine so we ordered the meatball pizza and chickUN fingers. It was really a delicious meal. I was also excited that my sister enjoyed it. They also offer Strongbo Cider by the bottle. I haven't been able to find that since I was in England years ago. Their sister restaurant Hussong's Cantina that is just a few feet away also offers a full vegan menu. We did not eat there but absolutely will my next visit. All fellow vegans please support these restaurants that have made the effort to offer us wonderful dining options!",

It wasn't too busy of a night and we were seated right away. We shared the tortellini salad which was a big serving, more than enough for two people to share. We used a yelp check in and received a free order of garlic parm fries. The pesto aioli was bomb dot com! We also decided to share the supreme pizza sans olives. Our food came out timely and our server checked in occasionally. Pretty nice spot to check out for chill dining and good pizza!",

With no real food today, except what cows eat I was really craving something that was a main staple that was packed with protein and carbs too! Been working it so good that it will not even hurt the diet. Or if it was I can work it off on the treadmill tomorrow morning. So it's all good.  Pizza is a main staple of any good diet. My relationship with pizza goes back to as far as I can remember! Now with a new pizza joint that when I walk in is playing Saturday Night Fever, who could go wrong. Everyone is staying alive! Not able to get on the John Travolta moves I can sing in my head and tap my foot to the wonderful beat. It's entrancing too!  The bar is where I chose to sit and enjoy my food. The bartender was very helpful and attended to my needed. The bartenders name was Caitlin, she was absolutely fabulous. She kept such a clean bar, and was able to even keep the dishes right behind the bar clean as she went in the dish washer. The Slice of Vegas rewards the customer for their Yelp check in too. Woo-hoo with Parmeson Fries. They were so good but with a side of ranch of course. I also had a slice of cheese from the happy hour menu. For only $3.00, what a steal! The cheese slice hit the spot since I have been craving pizza. Deciding dessert was a must I ordered the Cookie Skillet. It combine chocolate and Carmel sauce on vanilla ice cream with whip, nuts, and a cherry all made to order. Are you getting hungry yet? The cookie is warm so its sort of like a hot fudge sundae but way better. This dessert is orgasmic. Sorry for the reference but us ladies will understand; its that fabulous!",

Waited about 30 minutes for a table.  Realized we could grab some beers/wine and a couple of slices of pizza for the girls to snack on at their grab and go area (both workers there were excellent as well).    Enjoyed a large pizza we all shared plus several plates of pasta and appetizers.  Shortly after our food came there was a show next to the bar that we didn't anticipate.  Turns out there is a comedian/magician/fire eater that does a quick show in the evenings.  I was surprised that most guests didn't pay much attention - but we LOVED him and were thoroughly entertained.  When he was done he chatted with several tables and ended up pulling a chair up to our table and joined us for some close up magic, comedy & story telling.  The table had an absolute blast with him - well worth a good tip!  What started as a last minute \"let's find somewhere to get some pizza\" turned into a really awesome evening with good food/drink and great unplanned entertainment.   Highly recommend - and try to get a table near the bar and hope the entertainment is there!",

We came in a crazy busy time, so we had to wait about 45 minutes, but we hung out there and had some sodas. Pizza tasted great and service was pleasant. I'll definitely be back :)",

At the end of the night I think the quorum agreed it was an excellent decision.  After a day and part of the night full of drinking and gambling beer, wings and pizza was it for dinner.    The wings were tasty, fresh and perfect with the side of ranch.  The Parmesan fries were good too! We shared two types of pizzas, the meat lovers as well as the chicken bbq. Both were delicious and were gone in minutes.  It was easy to decide what type of pizza to share and we all had a good time.  Food is reasonably priced and service is fast surprisingly good considering the time we came in.    Our large group was seated in the rear where there were a few tvs. There was a display of old matches and old memorabilia/art of historic Vegas which I enjoyed. The place was comfy and accommodating.  If I stay at the Delano again, I wouldn't hesitate to dine here again.  Thanks Slice of Vegas for excellent food, service and pictures... you helped make a quick bachelors party memorable.  Cheers and see you all soon!",

In terms of drinks I had the mojito and it was pretty good slightly overly sweet but plenty of mint which is always nice.  Overall great experience if you're in the Mirage!

    "text": "A side salad, truffle fries, vegan supreme pizza, vegan BBQ pizza, cauliflower alfredo, and cinnamon pizza dough balls. Phew, lots of food.   First off, as said by probably hundreds of people already, SoV is an awesome place for dinner for a group of vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters. Everyone seemed pretty happy with their meal.   SoV's pretty decent. They messed up by giving us a buffalo vegan pizza instead of BBQ, but they were great about it and gave us a pair of free desserts, which they didn't have to do.  The truffle fries were super truffly and, best of all, free with check in (it says garlic parmesan but our waiter let us switch it up.) The two pizzas were good in their own ways. I can't really say which I preferred -- they were both good sizes, but the supreme was definitely more substantial with toppings. Above average tasting pizzas, but nothing earth-shattering.   I was most intrigued by the cauliflower alfredo before ordering, and it turned out to be pretty good. I think everyone agreed it was decent (or better), but the strong rapini and garlic flavors were more reminiscent of Asian food than anything else to some who tried it. I enjoyed it, but it didn't remind me of alfredo. If you've got an open mind, give it a try. I don't know that I'd recommend it too highly with it costing $20 and giving me DEATHLY gas the next morning, but I enjoyed it.   The dough balls were alright. They'd be really good with a scoop of ice cream. Half of the balls we got were still raw in the middle, but the ones that weren't were fluffy goodness.   Our waiter was attentive but not overly so, and the beer selection is decent -- both winners in my book.   What wasn't a winner was the magician who shouted for half our meal and was nothing but a distraction. My dude, we just want to eat and talk. After awhile he found some kids to entertain.. that was nice. Win-win.   As I said already, SoV is a safe choice for meat eaters and non meat eaters alike in Las Vegas -- and it doesn't suck. Worth a look when you're staying at Mandalay Bay.",

It's a bit greasy, but just like how most pastas are, at least the flavor was very good. I then went there a second time and got the building your own pasta to get it to $30 so I could use the Yelp deal. It was also delicious!  It's on the lower side of budget for a restaurant inside a hotel because they give you big portions. I sampled a few bites of other dishes as well and they all tasted good.  Service was friendly and prompt too.   Honestly I had lower expectations for a place like this inside the hotel, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  I'd come back if I'm craving some pasta and is in Mandalay Bay.  *** Don't forget to buy the Yelp deal! It's almost like 50% off! (Limited one per table though.)",

The filet of grilled salmon was tasty and fresh and served with angel hair pasta tossed in garlic and olive oil with cherry tomatoes and fresh basil. My husband had the Bisteaka, chef's cut of steak grilled to how you like it and came with potato hash and red wine mushroom sauce.  It was a little crowded that evening so the atmosphere was a little loud. Dimmed lighting. As crowded as it was, though, we were seated immediately and our server was very attentive, always checking on us if everything was alright.

    "text": "Being a Saturday evening, it's hard to find a good eatery without the long wait.  This place, located in the mall between Mandalay and Luxor, was still half empty around dinner time so we sat down right away.  My BIL got me an Italian Creamsicle to start with, as I needed a drink (one of those days).  Pretty yummy if you like sweet drinks like me.  I ordered the Bowl of Pastabillities (create your own pasta) with rigatoni, pomodoro sauce, and shrimp ($14.95 pasta/sauce + $5.95 shrimp = $20.90).  One of my kids got the spaghetti and alfredo sauce with sausage and shrimp (+ $3.95 sausage = $24.85).  The pasta was just okay, nothing special.  My hubby's meatball sandwich ($12.95) was okay too.  My mom and sister shared a Caesar salad ($11.95) and an 18\" Choked Pig pizza ($29.95), which had pesto aioli, mozzarella cheese, bacon and artichoke mix, topped with chopped basil and whiskey sour cream (they wanted to try something different).  They said that the taste of anchovies in the Caesar salad dressing was strong, and the pizza was eh (I tried it and I didn't really like it).  Overall, the food was average at best but overpriced.  Service was nice so I gave it 3 stars.",

    "text": "My group is staying at Mandalay Bay, so naturally we ended up checking out the shops.  My brother and I stopped in here for happy hour since we needed a snack to tide us over until dinner time.  We sat at the bar and a nice young lady showed us the specials. One thing that really impressed me was the beer selection. TONS of craft beer. Most of it was stuff distributed out to the east coast, so I've seen or tried most of it before but there were enough new things from out west for me to try.  We each ordered a slice of cheese pizza and the garlic parmesan fries to split. The pizza was pretty sad. Dried out, overcooked, not very cheesy. Reminded me of something you'd get in a high school cafeteria or gas station. The fries were good, and I really liked the pesto aioli.   The crappy pizza is the real reason for three stars. Everything else was good. Even for the cheap price, it seemed pathetic. When your logo is a damned pizza slice, you should make an effort to make a better pie.  Maybe we were there on a bad day, but at least the happy hour prices were good!",

    "text": "I had heard from many people that eating vegan in Vegas was fairly difficult. I found quite the contrary. I also was coming from a highly isolate hunting community in the middle of northern Canada, so I could be a bad judge but many restaurants in Vegas not only offer vegan options but have a fully vegan menu available upon request. Slice of Vegas was of our first stops, the night we arrived. We were famished, of course. Slice of Vegas is located in lovely Mandalay Place which is easily accessible from the Luxor hotel. Unfortunately, the restaurant was full, so we didn't get to dine in but the waitress told us we could order from their take-out window. That's what we did. Ana and I opted on sharing the BBQ chick'n pizza, Dave went for the meatless meatball sub and we all got a slice of their peanut butter chocolate cake for dessert.  The food was incredible, flavourful and even the biggest meat-eater would not be disappointed with the vegan food. The cake was simply delicious that I can't help but rave about that all on it's own. It was moist and extremely chocolatey, along with that delicious peanut butter creamy frosting. It was the perfect place to start off my palate's vacation.",

Great for you, bad for your neighbors and any surrounding vampires ;)   The spicy marinara has a good kick too it. Not overly spicy, but enough to satisfy your taste buds. Restaurant has a sports bar vibe with TV's in every direction and an impressive beer menu. Worth eating at when you want a relaxing, casual evening.",

We each ended up with 1.5 slices each. The dehydrated pineapple made it the saddest Hawaiian pizza we had ever seen. Again, it wasn't horrible, but was definitely unexpected.  Lastly, we ordered Mama's Garlic Bread. We opted to get cheese with ours and all I could taste was cheese. At least the order came with 4 slices. It also comes with a roasted garlic for you to rub the garlic on yourself. That was different...  Overall, the food isn't horrible but could have been better. Quite average. The service was decent.",

The pizza looked very gourmet on all the signs and in all of the advertisements I saw at the Luxor.  We had just gotten to Vegas and were famished so we decided to have pizza for lunch.  We ordered a Sausage, Mushroom, Onion, jalapeno pizza.  Everything on top was incredible.  Fresh toppings, tasty sauce, good amount of cheese. The crust was thin, which was perfect for us, but it was a little too crispy.  Probably about an 1/8 of an inch of hard crispiness. This is totally personal preference.  We thoroughly enjoyed the pizza and the friendly service.    Great place!",

I hate when a restaurant takes your glass away from the table to do a refill. Just bring a new glass!!!",

    "text": "I cannot believe the high ratings this place had. Granted, I got it to go by the slice, here is my story:  I was nursing a pretty sick hangover. It was around 3pm. Staggering back to my room at the Luxor, from my friends room at Mandalay Bay, I passed by Slice of Vegas, and was drawn in, if by nothing but the fact it would be quick and to go. There was no one in line. I placed my order, as did about 10 people that lined up behind me. It wasn't until all 10 had been placed that cashier started to dish out slices from the case which I had until this point figured had been for display only. I mean why else would it have not been served as soon as I ordered it? About 20 minutes later, everyone's orders placed she began throwing the slices out. my room was a brisk 3 minute walk away, and by the time I arrived the slice was cold. It didnt even look appetizing. Didnt taste any better than it looked. It had that concession stand pizza taste, only older.  Much better options for a quick bite to eat, maybe you have to get the whole pie to not have a horrid experience?",

It was quick but  wasn't cheap which I knew it wouldn't be. I had a cheese slice, he got pepperoni. It's pretty basic pizza that you get at any shopping mall. It was edible and works if you're drunk or hungry but I wouldn't choose to eat here or recommend it.",

Unsurprisingly for a strip restaurant it was pricey.  I would have given it another star but for the utter lack of attention I received at lunch.  Sat at the bar for 5 minutes without a bar tender coming over.  Then I sat at a booth.  The waitress promptly took my order and brought my soda.  That was last time I saw her until my lunch was finished.  The restaurant wasn't that busy so I don't understand why I was ignored.",

When we mentioned it to our server, she tried to tell us that it's always like that, but said she'd have her manager come to speak to us. He came over and said that's just how it is because of the bread they use and then they toast it. No attempt at customer service whatsoever! When our pasta came, you could tell it had been sitting for a while. The pasta was so hard it couldn't even be considered al dente and the sauce dried up within minutes. Seriously, the best thing we had there was a tequila shot, and that's because they didn't have to cook it!",

The second time I got the vegan meatball sandwich, the \"Not You're Momma's Garlic Bread\", and the vegan cake.   The vegan meatball sandwich was good, but the \"Not You're Momma's Garlic Bread\" was amazing - incredibly uniquely flavored, and unlike anything else I've ever had.  It comes with three large slices and on its own would probably be almost enough for a meal. I also recommend the cake - the cake portion was good, and very moist but could have been slightly more chocolatey.  But the frosting was unbelievable.",

    "text": "At 4:00 on Sunday 1-26-2014 the young woman at the take out slice was occupied by whatever was on her phone and acted put off by me trying to order. After ordering two two topping slices I was told that the price was fifteen dollars. I stated that a slice on the menu was less than that. This scholar hunched her shoulders and told me the prices were on the menu. After looking at the pool of grease on the display slices and considering her attitude I left. Then, as if I couldn't eat anywhere else, she shouted \"next!\"  Maybe it would have been effective if someone had been waiting. Too many options to have to put up with stupid. Come on folks, teach your servers the basics of customer service. How many bad reviews before people stop even giving you the chance?  And if you are having relationship problems, call in sick. It should not be your customer's problem.",

To our delight not only did they have pizza for one child (really good size portion for kids menu), some of the best mac 'n cheese I've ever had. Plus I had their Antipasto salad and my husband a sandwich. We loved it so much we grabbed a few slices one evening after hanging out in the pool. (You can get it by the slice  - but I recommend if you are gonna need a whole pizza order ahead. It takes 15 -20 min. or they overcharge for by the slice.)",

We also made our own pizza and ordered a 12 inch pepperoni pizza for $14.95 and added mushroom for $1.95. The pizza was pretty standard but hit the spot.   If you are looking for a quick bite or a place to relax after drinking and spending time in the casino, Slice of Vegas is perfect. Also, the pizza is good for hangovers ;)",

If you're vegan and in Vegas this is a great spot :)   Recommend the Not Your Mama's Garlic Bread and the Buffalo Pizza, the fries are good too! They do a great job on their sauces (spicy marinara, pesto, etc). I also tried the Spaghetti with meatballs and garlic, the noodles and sauce were delicious, the meatballs were okay, but not exceptional.",

    "text": "The overall look of this place is great, however, it seems as though that is what you are paying for. Food is overpriced, most items are $20+ while just a few are $15 and below. The coupon you get when checking into this, does not make up for paying as much as you do.  We ordered an 18\" meat lovers pizza that was $30. We wanted to get a create your own pizza, but doing that with just one topping would have been $25, so we went with the signature pizza instead. It was very greasy, but there was more than enough of meat on every slice. We also got a pasta; angel hair-Alfredo ($15) with chicken (extra $5). The portion was good enough to split with two people, but the taste was very bland, there was also very little cube cut chicken pieces so paying the extra $5 was not worth it.  Before we sat down we noticed one of my family members wasn't doing so well due to his diabetes so we asked our server to please quickly bring us bread, water and anything else they had ready. Although we had stated why we needed it in a timely matter, we still had to wait about 10 minutes before we even received our water! One of our other family members had to go across the store to a mini mart and buy a few snacks for him, and also went in the \"walk in buy a slice\" area of this restaurant to get a pizza. Many waitresses were just looking at us nervously, which was bothersome.  Overall: overpriced, nice, but slow staff, food could have tasted better.",

They also had quite a number of good-looking side dishes ( such as spicy, roasted cauliflower ) and I imagine this would have been yummy on their cheese pizza..... alas, Sis doesn't like spicy & we wanted to get something Sis, Mr & I could all share  So we opted for the 4 Cheese w/ Truffle Oil.  I liked the creamy ricotta & the truffle was pungent in smell but unfortunately not in taste  So all in all, this wasn't all that bad but I'd probably look elsewhere, in seeking pizza nirvana",

I ordered a water \"It's 110 outside\" and the waitress seemed miffed, came by every five minutes asking what she could get me from the bar, even after i told her i would just be having the water.  I tried to order a slice of their \"10 meat pizza\" which i have had previously, and was greatness. I was informed only cheese, pepperoni, or pepperoni and sausage was available by the slice (Name of restaurant is slice). I wanted the jalapeno Mac which i have had previously, so i just went with a slice of pepperoni and sausage, instead of ordering a full 10\" 10 meat pizza.   The Jalapeno Mac was awesome again, it's served in a bread bowl and has bacon. Don't leave without trying it.   The pizza on the other hand was pedestrian at best. Considering the greatness i remembered of the 10 meat pizza, i was expecting at least a very good slice, but i wouldn't consider it better than any mall pizza stop.   The questionable service combined with the rather low execution of their namesake \"slice\" of pizza really hurt the experience.",

Had to be down on the strip to fill out some tax paperwork, and thought I'd visit some former co-workers at the restaurant I used to work at next door to this establishment. After I left, I thought I'd grab something quick and easy, and relatively cheap, so I chose Slice of Vegas.   PROS:  -The young lady working the counter was extremely warm and friendly, and even complimented my makeup.  - Considering it's on the strip inside a nice resort (Mandalay Bay), it was only $4.50 for a HUGE slice of pizza. Pretty good value in my book.   CONS: THE FOOD. I now see WHY it's a good value.. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza (no drink) which came out quick and hot. I am not some super-duper health freak; I've had pizza before that had some grease on top (Chuck E. Cheese comes to mind..) and I'm totally ok with it and i eat it.. HOWEVER, there was SO much grease, it took 2 napkins just to get MOST of it off. There was barely any cheese and the sauce tasted funky. It was burnt underneath, and the crust was so hard I could barely bite into it.  Even after my attempt to drown it in parmesan cheese, it still was.. well.... disgusting. I can count on one hand in my entire life the times I found a pizza inedible,  and this was one of those times. I choked down as much as I could because I was starving,  but I would NEVER recommend this place for the pizza.",

Sure, I ate it, because I had a pizza craving. Rest of my party had: 12\" \"specialty\" pizza, $19.  18\" \"specialty\" pizza, $30.  It was a dinner of convenience - the place was inside the hotel, and only one of two restaurants offering GF selections.   Update: thank you to the manager for responding to the review. I appreciate good customer service.",

    "text": "I wish I had written this review 3 years ago when I first visited. Their vegan pizza and garlic/rosemary fries made me a BELIEVER! Every visit to Vegas, I'd tell my fellow travelers that we could not depart Vegas without dining at Slice of Vegas, once or twice ;)! Not doing so would equate to food blasphemy.   Unlike most pizza restaurants, Slice of Vegas has a dedicated menu for vegans. They advertise a variety of specialty vegan pizzas they will tantalize even the most strict dieters. During my visits, I have had the plain vegan cheese, the veggie pizza and barbeque chikn pizza--all were very good!   No complaints...until this week! I dropped by, excited to be back in Vegas at my favorite pizza restaurant and discovered after tasting my pizza that the chefs had replaced Daiya cheese with Go Veggie cheese; and were no longer using Gardien \"meats\". The pizza that we ordered wasn't satisfying at all. We actually took about three bites, and sent it back. Thankfully, they were gracious enough not to charge us. Still, I would have preferred delicious pizza; I came because I was prepared to spend money. :(  Slice of Vegas, I beg of you, please return to using Daiya cheese. I loved your pizza and dragged everyone I knew to your spot and made them BELIEVERS too. I wanna be a believer again. I hope you reconsider.",

The romelia salad was so light fresh and tasty as well, definitely recommend trying it. The penne vodka was ok, not the best but not bad. Overall great place and good service",

I kept walking by this restaurant when going to Luxor to Mandalay Bay and back. The smell of the pizza got to me the first day. Once someone suggested we eat it for lunch before heading back to LA, I was all in.  For 3 people, we ordered the 18 inch Helldorado. Let's just say, it was hella good. We all love a little spice and the jalapenos definitely helped, but it wasn't very spicy. Us Koreans love our spice, so we all added chili peppers to our slices. What I enjoyed the most was the whole crust. The bottom of the pizza was cooked perfectly; it had the best crunch that added great texture to the pizza. Plus it wasn't too heavy. It seemed like it was thinner than normal pizzas that I usually have, which was perfect for me.  The only thing is that you can't order by the slice when dining in, only whole pizzas. At first, that was a downer, but honestly, we all enjoyed the Helldorado so much, it turned out to be for the better.",

I ordered a couple items to go. They were pretty quick, but not super friendly...The food came out, and I walked it back to my room. I was staying just upstairs, so it was a matter of minutes before I was able to dig in!      I ordered meatballs, fried raviolis and some garlic cheese bread, for a little variety. Highlight was the roasted garlic head with the bread. I absolutely love roasted garlic and I shmeared it onto the bread, yum! The raviolis were a little soggy and bland, and the meatballs tasted frozen/processed. Between those two things, and the lack of friendliness from the gentleman at the counter, it gets three stars.",

    "text": "I would give this place 0 stars if I could. My husband is gluten and dairy intolerant and can not eat these items without getting violently ill. He even throws up blood from time to time due to the severity of his sensitivity. I wanted to treat him to a nice lunch and got very excited when I saw that this place was advertised as gluten free and vegan. Upon ordering we were informed that the pizza was cooked in an oven with other items but that it was still gluten free so we proceeded with the order. The waitress then informed us that the pizza was very small and we would want to add something else to our order. I asked which items were gluten free and she informed me that the wings were gluten free. Upon receiving the appetizer we were told they were cooked in the same fryer and were not in fact gluten free after we had started eating. After leaving my husband got violently ill and called to complain. We were informed that it was our fault for ordering the items because of cross contamination that we should have been knowledgable of.  We only went to this place because it was advertised as gluten free. We would not have ordered if we knew that NONE OF THEIR ITEMS ARE ACTUALLY GLUTEN FREE The customer service after this mistake was just added insult. The manager was unapologetic and uncaring of our situation. He claimed that they ask about celiacs disease and give warnings about cross contamination which was not even slightly hinted at. He also said that there was a miscommunication when in fact we were blatantly lied to. We specifically asked questions regarding my husbands allergies and were instructed to purchase items that conflicted with these allergies. If you advertise that items are gluten free they need to actually be gluten free.  YOU WOULD NEVER SERVE SOMEONE WITH A SEVERE NUT ALLERGY A DISH CONTAMINATED WITH NUTS",

Was skeptical of the \"NY Style\" pizza advertised (I'm from Jersey).  Nonethless we ordered two personal pizzas (the meat one - and the Il Mangino). I was wholely impressed - I just loved the Il Mangino - the salad on top of a pie with prosciutto and ricotta was amazing. Our waitress let me try several of the beers on tap - recommending a few. All-in-all a great experience.",

The chicken was truly disgusting--low quality, not marrinated, unseasoned, undercooked and definitely wasn't grilled, perhaps boiled or pan cooked. I found it inedible. Once I removed the chicken, the pizza was pretty good. Sat ten minutes at the table after we finished our food (empty drinks also) and we finally had to flag down our waitress for the bill",

Lucky for me this places has a new vegan menu with many delicious items. They may still be getting the details worked out as my garlic fries did come with parmesan cheese on them, but it was immediately taken care of. My veggie meatbull sub was pretty delicious. Prices on many of the items seemed a bit high, but they all sounded amazing. I couldnt't bring myself to the try the nearly 20$ vegan 12 inch pizza, but it sounded great. Service was above and beyond as well. My boyfriend enjoyed his non veg sandwhich as well, even eating all his peppers which he normally does not enjoy. I do think the beers on tap could be expanded, but they do have a large selection of bottles available.",

I myself had The Bootlegger burger a.k.a, Bleu cheeseburger. Being from Chicago, I feel my opinion on burgers can be taken seriously. This was an incredible display of flavor. The burger meat itself was top notch, tender and flavorful. However the flavor doesn't stop there. Mushrooms, grilled onions, JALAPENO BACON, and avocado, yes avocado. This complex burger is perfect in texture and flavor. Try it with sweet potato fries. The very next day I had to have it again, so I did. There are many different options for food, but I couldn't bring myself to pass it up. Cool bar and even cooler bartender. Johanna said it was her first day, but that was very hard to believe. She was very attentive and knew how to handle the rush, a True pro, not to mention very friendly with a great smile. I have to finally recommend the Red Tail Ale, what a brew. Can't wait to go back, it will be my first stop for a bite and brew. Thanks for a great time Slice of Vegas, and of course our superstar bartender Johanna!!!",

From the time we sat down until the time we left, Mike provided nothing but a warm welcoming atmosphere, was prompt to our attention and periodically checked up to make sure we were satisfied.  The food is what you would expect, pizzas, pastas, and various Italian-inspired dishes.  If you come expecting Olive Garden quality, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Personally, the food at Slice tastes much more fresh and has better quality / portions for what you pay.  At the back, there is a page full of gluten-free options, which has lots of options.  Mlife users, be sure to save your receipt and take it to the Mlife desk for your tier credits!  There is a $69.99 challenge of finishing a Double stack 18\" pizza in under an hour.  All terms and conditions are listed in the menu which is nice.  They leave a comment card in the check billfold, which allows you to give feedback right then and there.  For those who are looking for a quick bite, they have a separate counter to the right of the restaurant where you can simply purchase a slice of pizza and take it to go.  No pastas or entrees served from this area.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for quality pizza or various menu items.",

We ordered the garlic bread with pesto ($8) and the family sized 10 mile meat ($29.95).  The garlic bread was decent, though I like my pesto spread a bit chunkier where you can distinctly taste the pine nuts and parmesan. Overall, not a bad starter.  The pizza was good, not the greatest in town, but worth coming back to (especially with the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> deal $25 off when you spend $37.50. Can't beat that!). I like my crust all around to be a bit more chewy and airy...the rest of the pizza was very good, ample toppings.   The service was friendly and attentive and the restaurant was clean.   +Bonus points for the parmesan condiment on the table being real parmesan (as opposed to the crap they hand you at a pizza chain).  I would return, not at full price, but def with the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> deal...it was a score.",

Service was prompt and friendly as there was quite a few servers working for early Saturday lunch shift.  Slice offers, pizza's, pasta, sandwiches, salads and burgers.  We tried a burger and a Philly cheese steak sammie.  Both entree's came with choice of sweet potato or regular fries.  We both got sweet potato fries and the portions were huge!  Both of our sammies were well cooked big and flavorful not to mention the prices were considerably cheaper than Burger Bar.    One cool item we noticed was the big glass beer taps you can order and have placed on your table or in front of you at the bar.  Basically at least a yard size glass tube with its own tap on the bottom so you can pour your own glass, totally cool.  I strongly recommend trying this place if your stuck in Mandalay and want to eat some place good but still affordable.",

I wish we were there for lunch hen you can order pizza by the slice!!! Oh, and don't forget to check in for your 15% discount! Every bit of savings counts in Vegas!",

Had to wait a little so she gave the kids pizza dough to keep them entertained.  We ordered a Caesar salad to share and family size half pepperoni and cheese. Garlic parmesan fries came free with check-in (score!). Food was really good. When ordering the Caesar, my niece tasted something crunchy so she asked if there were any nuts because she has an allergy. Johna assured us there were none. Later when we ordered the cannoli for dessert, she remembered my niece's food allergy! They come with pistachios. So thankful she was paying attention, I did not notice.  Definitely recommend trying this place out!!",

Over three visits, we had Mama's Garlic Bread spread with pesto, Buffalo pizza, Barbecue pizza, basil pesto fettucini, the pomodoro rigatoni, and the chocolate cheesecake.  All Vegan.  All prepped on a separate line from their other items with meat.  All really, I mean REALLY, good.    Oh, and really great moscow mules.    We are so grateful for this spot since it made dining in Vegas very pleasurable.   Aside from the food and their specialty menu, the comfort here along with the engaging staff makes SOV a favorite Vegas spot in my book!",

But considering this is Vegas and even drinks at Starbucks are priced twice that of everywhere else, this place does deserve credit for $5 beers and $4 pizza slices at Happy Hour!! The pizza itself was above average, not great but not terrible. The beer (Fat Tire on draft) was good. Again, they both felt better considering I had paid $40 for mediocre lunch that afternoon!  The place also looked clean, spacious and I saw families with kids eating there which tells me it's a decent place to visit.",

Our waitress was good about checking on us often.  It did take a bit to get the final bill from her but overall she was good, very friendly.  I had the Choked Pig pizza.  Toppings included Pesto aioli sauce, Mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, bacon and artichoke mix finished with chopped basil and a whiskey sour cream.  It was very tasty.  The Pesto was delicious but not overly strong.  The other toppings were great.  My mom had a basic pepperoni pizza which she enjoyed.  I ate both pizzas cold the next day and they were still good.  This is definitely a great place to go if you are looking for a really good thin crust pizza.  It looks like the place gets pretty wild with music and drinks on some nights.",

Yes, it's $4-5 slices of pizza - you're on the strip, get over it.    The food was fantastic - good size slices, excellent cook on the crust, well seasoned and tasty.  It's pizza, it's not hard to do it right and they have done that.  The setup/service at the to-go counter is a disgrace.  If it's 12 to 1am on the strip and you're one of only two places still open in this walkway you need to get your staffing right.  I mean, who isn't plowing down pizza at that time anyway!   ONE poor guy there Saturday night doing the order taking, cashier duty, grab the slices, warm the slices in the oven, box them up and get them out to the customers.  And there were at least 10 folks waiting when we arrived.  If not for poor staffing judgment, would probably be 5 stars!",

He took this place to the next level.  We ordered Mama's Garlic Bread with Mozzarella. It was very yummy. It came as a serving of four. Four was more than enough to hold us over until the pizza arrived.  We also ordered a pizza. With the waiter advice, we ordered the 12\" Sausage pizza. It was greasy as heck. It had small puddles all over it, but it was just so damn appetizing. It tasted like a oily heaven. We finished every slice of it.  We wanted to order the chocolate cake for dessert, but our wonderful waiter mentioned and recommended the Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Caramel. drizzles, that wasn't on the menu. I decided to order it. It took about 10 minutes for us to get the cookie, but when we did get it, it looked delectable.  We tasted the cookie and it was so warm and gooey. We got maybe half way through the cookie before we discovered that the caramel was salted. Not only was the caramel salted, it was salty. It started to become very unbearable. It wasn't the best. I wish I had just ordered the Cake instead.  Once the lunch was over, my stomach fell. I had to rush to the restroom. Sorry, I couldn't think of a nice way to say it. My friend's stomach didn't start hurting until she got home, maybe 2 hours later. I believe it was the pools of grease mixed with the taste of the cookie.  I know it was sounds stupid, but it was worth it. We will definitely go back. Next time, we'll just  pour off some of the pizza grease and skip over the cookie.",

This journey took us to a Slice of Vegas, a nice joint nestled in Luxor where you've got a family-friendly atmosphere in a pub like space.  First things first, check in on Yelp. Checking in on Yelp nabs you a free basket of fries. Forget any diets you're on because this is a table necessity that will prepare you for your actual pizzas coming out.  Between the four of us, we ordered a large Supreme and Carpanello which had a ton of cheese and arugula on top. Both were thin sliced pizzas and oh so good. Crust was definitely crispy and nicely puffed while the meat and cheese blended really well in both pizzas. It was enough to fill our bellies and our hearts.  If you're around the area and looking up for a good spot to get rid of those pizza cravings, Slice of Vegas can certainly have a slice of your heart (and belly).",

The Chicken Parmesan was a little burnt for my liking and the pasta was extremely dry, hardly any marinara. My boyfriend, however, loved it. He enjoyed the extra crunch!  The pizza was the best part of the meal! Not too Spicy, crisp crust, and overload of toppings! It was spectacular.  We did not try anything from the Vegan menu. Everything looked great on it. The type of menu they have put together for the Vegan crowd is unlike any other pizza place in town!",

    "text": "Was hoping for a nice pre-show fine dining experience at the Mandalay Bay, but everything was fully booked for the times we wanted. So my girlfriend and I ended up walking the shopping mall between the Mandalay and Luxor and stumbled across this pizza place instead. Yea, it was more like a TGIF/Chili's type dining experience vs a michelin star type, but that was perfectly fine with me......love pizzas!....but due to my diet, I just don't eat it as often as I used to.  We didn't want to fill up too much since we'd be sitting down at the show for 90 minutes, so agreed on a salad and pizza to share. We ordered a Romelia's Salad and then decided to create our own.....12\" tomato sauce based pizza with toppings of cheese, mushroom, pineapple, garlic, red onion, and Roma tomatoes.  Firstly, the salad was a very big portion, fresh, and actually very good, especially with all the melody of ingredients tossed together......Romaine Lettuce, Mandarin Oranges, Red Onion, Cucumbers, Carrots, Avocado, Dried Cranberries, Apples, Candied Walnuts, Croutons, and Citrus Italian Dressing on the side..... Nice.  As for the pizza.....hmmm, loved the thin yet firm and crispy crust......and I kind of expected the toppings to blend well together as this pretty typical of what I'd usually order on my pizza....but, the pineapple was fresh (vs the sweet type from the can), but too unripe, sour, and really kind of ruined the taste of the pizza. No problem.....just removed the pineapple and the pizza actually tasted much better with a sprinkle of some dried chilli peppers.  Kind of nice \"TGIF'ish\" sports bar pizza atmosphere, that I would suspect gets pretty loud during the busy seasons, but thankfully, it was nice and quiet, and not too busy, when we were there. Service was good, friendly, and attentive.",

Their specialty are the pizzas but they had a variety of different pastas also and salads.  The food was good but the pizza could've had a little bit more red sauce I thought it was a little dry on that side but it's good",

    "text": "So this is a competitive market, especially in Vegas.  Seems like there are as many pizza choices as there are slot machines.  That being said everyone seems to have a favorite flavor, method, topping choice making this an even more difficult choice.  I liked this pizza.  It has a very good sauce and it definitely taste like a good old fashion slice of NY pizza.  The topping choices are plentiful and it's attached to a decent Italian restaurant and bar.  So why the 4?  It's Vegas and I want my pizza slice at 2am and they close at 11pm.  That's like the middle of prime time fun in Vegas and that kills this location for me.  They need to keep the walk up location open till at least 2 am.  That would make this a solid late night pizza option.  Otherwise you are in NY NY or Paris which is a pain in the butt!!",

    "text": "A little late (!) review, as I went in January this year! But backtracking on some places I haven't reviewed that I went to while in The Vegas. I loved this joint! In my hotel, it provided me with excellent vegan friendly choices! I brought back my brother and his girlfriend so he could get involved in some veggie friendly meat substitutions. I tried both the Meatless Meatball and The Vegan Faux Pie- both were delicious. As far as sides go, the Meatless Meatballs were good but a very small portion for the $ & the what I thought were faux 'chicken wings' turned out to be what we in the UK would deem were chicken nuggets? That was v disappointing, but I'm not sure what I expected I would get in a vegan chicken wing! Maybe over-expectation! Great, great pizza's though for vegans! Well worth the trip.",

I was even more excited when I saw that there was a deal on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>. I am all into meat lovers' pizza and I came into this restaurant, already knowing that I was going to order the 12-inch 10-meat pizza. The pizza was okay. I think the choices of the 10 different meats were misjudged. A lot of preserved and salty meat that made my pizza overall, pretty salty. I had to eat it with a side of ranch to get rid of the saltiness. I like that they made thin crust pizzas. For dessert, I got the cannolis, which I really liked! I was here around 6pm on a Friday and the place was 2/3 empty. The waiter was somehow pretty busy and we had difficulty catching his attention several times. Wouldn't go back and would've been disappointed if I actually paid full price and not used my deal. If craving pizza, I would recommend Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan. The white pizza is divine there.",

For this reason, they rip you off with a charge of 7 bucks for a simple slice of pizza.  Didn't notice this until I had already placed my order and that is on me. But I also added a side salad for almost 4 bucks, which I thought would come in a nice container with it all dressed up. No, it comes in a plastic bowl, just some greens thrown in with dressing on the side. Throw in a drink, with lousy options in their dispensers, and you've got an expensive quick bite for almost 16 bucks.  The pizza wasn't too bad, though nothing special and the salad was too plain.  It was in a place to kill some time, but as much as I love this area, I will not return to eat here.",

I wasn't particularly impressed by the food but it wasn't bad either. And it did come out very quickly which I always appreciate.

The crust is crunchy and very dry. I wasn't too stoked on it. It's not horrible, but it's not awesome. It seriously just tastes like Tombstone frozen pizza. They do have a decent beer selection though, so that's cool.  The service was mediocre. Our waitress was cool. She was nice and pleasant and took care of us. The service is just slow, maybe she had too many tables? It took awhile to get our food, it took even longer to get our check. At least she was attentive.   It seems to me most people who are giving it high ratings are eating off the vegan menu. I would have gladly eaten some items from the vegan menu to try it out, but my gf wasn't feeling it.   I wouldn't eat here again off the normal menu, but I'd try the vegan menu just to see if it really is all that it's hyped up to be. The only reason they got 3 stars is because they have some solid craft beer choices.",

The service was brilliant, all of the TVs showing sports confused me (disclosure, we had been in Vegas for two days at this point, I'm from England, we normally have a maximum of one TV showing the news) and the pizza gave me mixed feelings.  In the UK I have never experienced a pizza that has a puddle of grease in the middle of it. This pizza tasted absolutely wonderful but you had to hold it up and let the grease drip off of it before attempting to eat it. The portions were also a lot larger than we had expected. Upon finishing both my partner and I felt rather unwell and we had to rush back to our hotel room, there was far too much grease on the pizza and that caused us to feel rather nauseous.  All in all three stars, after the excess grease had dropped off of the pizza there was a rather pleasant taste to it but after leaving us attached to the toilet for the remainder of the day we weren't too impressed.",

I ordered the hawaii 5-0 pizza, with canadian bacon, bacon, nori and dehydrated pineapples.I thought the nori was a unique touch, gave the pizza more depth of flavor. I also liked that the pineapple was dehydrated so it didn't make the pizza soggy like pineapple usually does. It also gave a nice tang, which balanced out the saltiness of the bacon quite nicely. I would say it was an enjoyable pizza, but pretty typical.",

    "text": "Oh. My. God.   Located  in the shops that connect Luxor and Mandalay, I ate at this place TWICE in one day. Ordered the vegan pie, garlic pesto bread, garlic fries and chocolate cake with peanut butter icing on the lunch visit.   Lets start with Mama's garlic bread. Holy hell. This is probably the best garlic bread I have ever had. They give you a roasted head of garlic and the pesto on top is life changing. We ordered ours with Daiya as well. I just scooped out garlic (eventually resorting to squeezing every last drop of garlicky goodness from it's vessel) and spread it across the slices. It comes with four pieces of bread, so enough to share, if you are feeling generous. Well, everything we ate the portions were perfect for splitting.  Then the garlic fries. I don't know what kind of magical mayo like basil dip they came with as well as ketchup and a generous heaping of diced garlic sprinkled over top, but it draws you to it like a moth to a flame. The fries are super thin and cooked to perfection. Not over salted as often is the case with fries.  The pie. We ordered the 12\" vegan pizza with diced eggplant, zucchini, roasted pepper and Daiya cheese. It too, perfectly seasoned and portioned.  After all that, we still had room for the moist chocolate cake with whipped peanut butter frosting. Our slice was about 4 in. x 4 in. Atop a chocolate drizzled plate beside grapes rolled in sugar and a sprig of mint. It was nice to go from a well balanced and not overly sugary dessert to that little kick of wow. I have never once thought of doing that to grapes but it worked.  For my return dinner visit I ordered the vegan wings and more garlic, Daiya bread to go to eat on my return flight home. I was pleased to find I still got my roasted garlic in the box for the bread.  The wings were Gardein chicken strips with a sauce cup of buffalo sauce and one of ranch with carrot and celery sticks.    Vegas is not a place I will be returning anytime soon but if I did, you better believe I would find my way back to this place. Much better than the Cantina a couple of doors down which also offers vegan options (3 star review to follow). I was also impressed our waitress Bianca, though not vegan herself and with us being her first vegan customers had been telling people that the cake was vegan after they'd eaten and raved about it. She said people often have stigmas about vegan food being disgusting and it's just not the case. :)",

Slice of Vegas is located in Mandalay bay, just right next to Burgr bar. The place is big for a pizzeria but there is always a lot of people waiting to be seated.    The menu contains a typical selection of pizza, and my favorite pizza is the \"miles 10 meat\" pizza. like the name implies, the pizza has 10 different kind of meat on it. good thing about slice of vegas is that, the pizza was never frozen, u can really taste the freshness of it. The pizza slices were thin. it has that crispiness that I really like, with a perfect amount of chewiness. and the flavor is really good.   I have only tried 2 of their pizza at this place, the miles 10 meat and the 4 cheese truffle. The sauce on the pizza was good. its the perfect amount. on the miles 10 meat, the sauce was dark red, and a bit sweet. u cant really taste the tomato flavor of it, which is a good thing for me, since I hate tomatoes. The amount of cheese on it was in good balance. All the ingredients on the miles 10 meat were tasty. The 4 cheese truffle is good, but tends to be very oily.   Overall, the pizza were really good and I would really recommend it. its not really a wow factor but we are in vegas and not nyc. I think the pizza really taste good. it has the perfect balance of sauce, toppings and cheese. it has that perfect crispiness with every bite. ull even lick ur fingers, coz its that finger lickn good. lol.",

We started with the garlic bread with pesto. They brought us regular \"garlic bread\" which was 4 slices of Italian bread with a roasted bulb of garlic on the side. It was OK. The bread didn't have any kind of butter or oil on it. It was kind of an interesting take on garlic bread. For my entree I had the meatball panini. It was just OK. The best part were the garlic fries it came with. The meatballs we're homemade, but not that great.  Unless I'm stranded at Mandalay Bay and starving, I will not be returning to Slice of Vegas.",

TOO many places in Vegas to have a bartender have an attitude.  Manager was nice. Wanted to help.  Her name was Angie and she needs to go.  TOO many other places to put up with that!!!",

I like NY Style pizza and they have it although the sauce is a bit bland.  Big pieces.  $2.50 a slice for cheese during Happy Hour (min two slices per person) is great plus half off beer and wine. Good service.   It's SO hard to find decent dining at a reasonable price on The Strip. Everything in the hotels (aside from fast food) is SUCH a rip off. This is one of those few places that is attached to Luxor/Mandalay Bay and is decent food at a reasonable price in a good atmosphere. So as a result, I'm giving it 4 stars.",

A bit pricey too ($23) for a 18 inch pepperoni   Came here at 11:15PM or so I believe and they we're half way closed, but no problem could still buy the pizza by the slices!  I could not order any new pizzas, but in case you wanted to, it is $18.95 + $1.95 per topping for a large (18inch), 12 inch was $9.95 + $1.95 per topping and have specialties already made that range something like $25. They had some interesting ones like prosciutto and pesto, but I suppose I will have to try next time.   The girl who helped us was nice, but did not really listen well. My friend asked her to double slice the pizza and with her verbal reply we believe she understood. Unfortunately we walked quite the distance already to realize that she didn't, nor did she reheat the pizzas. I suppose reheating is a personal preference as the pizza was still warm, but to me, if I'm paying $23 for a large pepperoni, I expect it to be hot.   In the end, a good spot for drunken eats, but many better options on the strip.",

Waiter helped himself to a 20% tip (suppose to be 18% per cert) and over charged my credit card by $10. After I got home I called and spoke with a manager and he corrected the credit card charge. When I told him about the tip he gave me his email and said he would mail me the 2% back. The tip issue isn't worth my time.   I recommend staying away from Slice of Vegas. There are WAY too many other better places to eat. If you have eaten here check your credit card statement.",

Incredible deal considering that the pizza is huge and delicious!!! Limit was 1 per guest and additional toppings was $1.75 each.  We were one of the first there so we were greeted and seated right away. Julie was our waiter who waited on us very nice and kept making sure we were ok.  We ordered the jalapeno mac n cheese. I'm usually not a fan of restaurants mac n cheese but this. Omg. So good. It had bacon bits in too. My husband and I shared as an appetizer. It was served in a bread bowl. Which made it even more amazing. We also ordered my boys dough balls to play with while we waited for our food.  They were $2 each and so worth it.  The boys really enjoyed them lol   Only down fall for me was that they had no discounts on beer for locals. I understand being inside a casino on the strip they up beer prices for that reason. But again being local I wish I got a discount. They had some pretty awesome beers on draft that I wanted to try more of.    All in all this place is awesome! I'd come back again.",

    "text": "Once I heard that Slice of Vegas has a Vegan Buffalo Pizza, I knew it was only a matter of time before we would wind up here once our plane touched down in Vegas.  Located in the Mandalay Bay along with another Vegan-friendly restaurant by the name of Hussong's Cantina, Slice of Vegas offers a full on Vegan menu. It mostly consists of Gardein and Daiya based recreations of their regular menu. Hey, this is Vegas damnit! Nobody comes here to eat salad.  With so many options to choose from, I skipped the Buffalo Pie in favor of the regular version so that my babygirl would be able to share the pizza with me as she isn't too keen on spiciness. The thin crust was so so, but the rest was Daiya & faux meat heaven. I'm not the biggest Daiya fan, but it is great substitute for pizza.  I ordered a side of Vegan Buffalo Strips as an appetizer for myself. If I had known they wouldn't be very spicy, I would've went with the atomic sauce instead. It was odd they put the sauce on the side, rather than smothered into the strips. Perhaps it would've given it more flavor as well as the joy of getting your fingers messy as you much away on Buffalo sauced goodness. I enjoyed this but at $10.95, it's a bit pricey. Even for Vegas...  I wish I was hungrier on this visit as the menu had so many options to from. Various appetizers, pasta, soups, salads, desserts and more. So many pastabilities, so little room in my tummy. The prices could be lower for the quality of the food, but I can't complain too much. Even though I'm rating this 3.5 stars, I'm rounding up for the simple fact that this type of Vegan food in Vegas is a rare find, and the simple fact that I will be back again to try out more things. Oh, and to get that atomic sauce.",

Granted, we went to the deli area to get some slices to-go to eat in our room since we had crawfish for dinner like five-hours prior but does it make that much of a difference to dine-in?

The pizza itself was thin and soggy and all the toppings were on the verge of sliding off and into my lap.  Not a great start.  While the bites with toppings and cheese had okay flavor, once you hit the crust, it's game over.  Tasteless!

The garlic bread was good, but I wish it was a little more toasted. Now the chocolate cake. This was by far one of the best vegan cakes I've had. That peanut butter frosting was to die for. Even my non vegan friend loved it. Thank you for having vegan options!",

    "text": "This sweet elderly woman asked me for help. I thought I would be doing her a favor by taking her $100 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon off of her hands since she didn't have a smart phone or access to a computer/printer.  My bad...  First,  I tried a really nice restaurant,  but they would only let me use $25 at a time. Next,  I drove to 2 Japanese restaurants,  but they both didn't accept the coupon.  Then I drove to a diner, but they closed at 3pm. I should have checked my Yelp app since the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> app didn't update the diner's hours.   Finally,  I called A Slice of Vegas and made reservations with the friendly receptionist.  I walked all over Mandalay Bay casino,  but could not find the restaurant.  By this time, I was at the fainting/exasperated point.  I called the receptionist again and she patiently guided me through all of the shops to her smiling face!   The energetic and helpful server, Pete,  called his manager to help me figure out how to use the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> app where I had to order $75 worth of food to use $50 of the coupon. It was so worth it!  The \"Choked Pig\" pizza had a fantastic thin, crisp crust which went well with the bacon,  artichoke & whiskey sour cream topping.  The Salmon Portofino was seared perfectly with the moist, fresh, firm fish salted & peppered just right!  I ate the Brownie Sundae with gusto and took the cannoli & tiramisu to go with my doggie bag. Am enjoying the leftovers now as I compose this review.   Everyone at A Slice of Vegas was attentive and understanding.  I really appreciate their help and their amazing food!  I learned a lot and will return again for the sandwiches and salads or maybe another pizza!",

Both were great! The ranch that came with the wings was superb, as was the sauces on the wings and the meatballs. We were literally licking our fingers! Next we got the barbecue chikun pizza which was also delicious. To top it off, a yummy chocolate stout beer and vegan chocolate peanut butter cake with sugar coasted grapes on the side. This was literally to die for. The service at this place was ok, on the mediocre side, but overall we loved it and would definitely come back to try the rest of the menu!",

It was around 3:30 on a Tuesday so there were only like four other booths taken.  Our server was nice with cool tattoos and recommended her favorite dishes. We ordered wings and since they were half off for happy hour we ordered a BBQ and a hot. Both were delicious! My favorite part of the meal. The BBQ had a little kick too it and was that sticky sauce you lick off your fingers..yum! They were very big with a lot of moist meat. My only complaint would be that the hot flavor was not hot enough for my taste. We also ordered a Caesar salad which was really good too, the croutons were very garlicy and the sauce very creamy. The pizza was kind of greasy and the crust underdone. So the app and salad was what brought my rating up to 4 stars! Not great on the pizza, but the wings were amazing! And salad great!",

    "text": "Passable. Nothing was bad and surely nothing was great- with the exception of the roasted elephant garlic which accompanied the garlic bread. No way that was a 12 inch pizza. Thank goodness I only ordered one with one topping. I would have been really miffed if I would have gotten one of the specialty ones that was 19$ for that dinky of a pizza. Salads are crazy over-priced- I mean crazy...$12 for a salad they said was supposed to have a variety of items besides lettuce. Was almost all lettuce and a pittance of the other items. Beer prices are a little high as well. Service was a mix- waiter was very nice and helpful. However one of the hostesses was literally a deer in headlights. She must have literally stared at me for 4 or 5 minutes while I stood in front of her. I finally had to say I had a reservation and she was like \"Oh\" It was really weird and then sadly her manager remarked that she's \"highly qualified to be a hostess\" instead of saying he was sorry for what happened. Strange management. Incredibly overpriced. A big waste of your time. The taste of the food is just over a 3 out of 5, but their cheapness in ingredient use and price-gouging lands them an overall 2. If you come here, you surely won't leaving saying the food tasted bad, but you might be mad at yourself for the reasons mentioned above. There are SO many better places to go in Vega$ @ all price points where you get your money's worth whether high or low. This is SURELY not one of them.",

We went ahead and took the advise went to this slice of Vegas place waited 20 mins to be seated. Got in sat down ordered and waited an hour for the manager to finally come talk to us about the ridiculous wait time. He said he will check after the waitress had already told us she was very sorry and her manager was made aware of a back up they had in the kitchen. He came up to us very unapologetic and more clueless about the situation. As he was there telling us he will check the times on Order, ...as if we would sit there and lie about wait time., point blank our kids left crying and we decided to leave and not do business with this location where management sucks.

    "text": "Bought a dining certificate from Travelzoo $39 dinner: 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. We called in advance to make a reservation for Friday at 7 o'clock; it was totally unnecessary. The restaurant was only half full.   We were first seated in booth overlooking the mall, but I became nauseated from the overpowering scents wafting over from Lush. They moved us without any trouble.  We asked to substitute beer for wine, but no go. House wine was the only option. Two pinot grigios were brought over. It was really sharp, way too much acidity.  We started with the tuscan salad ($10.95) Fresh spring mix, tossed with diced Roma tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, sliced red onion, basil, parsley and toasted chunks of herb  infused bread. Finished with an aged balsamic vinaigrette. And garlic fries ($6.95). The salad was nicely dressed and fresh only complaint was the lack of mozzarella cheese. The fries were shoestring and crisp, but pretty average. The garlic aioli was heavy; not a fan.  Next we had the Margherita ($18.95) pizza and the rigatoni with meatballs and bologonese ($17.90). With a name like Slice of Vegas I had to try the Pizza. I wish I hadn't. The rigatoni was far superior. The margherita crust was tasteless and the ingredients lacked that high quality flavor. It was a real disappointment. The meatballs were ok, they tasted too bready to me, but the bolgonese sauce with the rigatoni was a real surprise. My husband and I both liked it.  If I were judging the pasta and salad on its own, I'd give an A-OK rating, but since the signature item is pizza. This was definitely \"meh\" and we were thankful our tab was about 50% off. It's definitely not worth full price.",

It's in a wrap style, so shrimp tails should've totally been removed!  4th, the check was very clearly split up, but still charged wrong!  Not somewhere I'd recommend for groups. It might be ok for 1-3 people, but not sure...  I'm not a person to typically be harsh, but this was kinda ridiculous! I'd've given it a 1 star rating, but my food actually tasted good... But very overpriced! $40 for a personal pizza & 2 martinis!",

    "text": "Dear Slice of Vegas, It disheartens me to have to write this letter about the experience myself and 9 of my friends had at your restaurant tonight.  -Tonight 10 friends of mine all got together to celebrate an upcoming wedding in our group of friends. -We arrived at Slice of Vegas about 7:45 PM and were promptly seated in your nice back room by no later than 7:55 PM.  -We were greeted by our waiter who took our drink order and then followed up to take our dinner order with normal service. -Before ordering we requested our bill to be split about 5 ways, that's just how it is when you are in big groups.  -When it came time for us to order while ordering we specifically asked for some extra sauce on the side of our meal.  -All of our meals came out promptly/hot but were delivered by somebody other than our waiter and that's when everything started to go downhill for our group.  -This is the beginning to when we never saw our waiter again.  -After 15 minutes of having an empty water cups, and not receiving the extra sauces I requested on the side of my wife and my meal I went out to the main dining area with my wife's and my water cups to be refilled by the bar tender. The bartender wouldn't fill my cups instead she flagged down the original waiter who from the other side of the room shouts \"What do you need!\" In a disinterested tone. I raised up my two empty glasses of water and approached him, he said he'll bring them to the table, I also requested the sauces that I had ordered with the meal (ranch and marinara).  -He did then promptly came to the table with 2 waters for us after I did this, and told me the sauces are on their way, but he didn't take the time to ask anybody else if they needed anything (3/4 of the drinks, waters and $2.95 sodas were empty). We still had never had the usual \"Did everything come out alright?\" that you get, especially when you weren't the actual waiter that handed out the food.  -After about 7 more minutes of waiting for the sauces (and 34 of all the food eaten on the table), I approached the main dining room where he looked at me from across the room and shouted again \"what do you need!\" This time seeming irritated and not caring at all, it was at this exact time the sauces were being delivered by another waiter.  -We continued to complete our meal, but still had absolutely 0 interaction at our table in the back room with our waiter since we gave him our order at the beginning of the evening. Everybody still had empty drinks and nobody had come by to check up on us. -After about 20 minutes of us all sitting there, waiting for our checks I had, had enough of this nonsense and talked to the \"manager\" of the night. I explained to him, verbatim what I just described to you, drinks had never been refilled, sauces didn't come until the meal was practically completed, never seen our waiter again. I asked the manager \"Joseph\" if he felt the service we had received was \"unacceptable\". Joseph would not agree/use the word unacceptable, he would transition into saying it's busy, and apologized. I informed him again about the horrible and lack of service that was provided and once again inquired to see if it he felt it was \"unacceptable\" once again he changed the subject to doing their best and it's really busy. So I inquired as to if this is what service should be like and is expected to be like in this restaurant, because if so I'd like to inform my friends. He said \"No, it isn't\" so I informed him then it's \"unacceptable\" isn't it. -The checks were finally brought out. No nice check folder, just a Hodgepodge of nonsense handing them out willy-nilly. To my frustration, we all found that a 20% gratuity was automatically added to all our checks. This I felt was beyond unacceptable for the amount of service/lack of service rendered for the evening. -I Approached the manager about it, he said it's company policy and he \"can't do anything about it\", I explained again all the things we had been through in the evening again (we just had this conversation less than 4 minutes ago) he continued with his story of \"it's corporate policy we can't change it\" this went on for over 8 minutes until I told him, if that is company policy then we are all paying cash and leaving no tip at all if that is how the company does business. He then finally agreed to remove the tip, but in a last attempt to still do little to nothing about the situation he tried to just take it off my 1 check out of the 5 at the table. I then requested he take it off all 5 of our checks, which he finally did. After this was all said and done we noticed that your waiter had put 2 $.50 sauces on everyone's bills. There was no notification that it was an upgraded charge for sauce, and not everyone wanted sauce or ranch and I guarantee there were more charges for sauces on all our bill than actual sauces were provided to our table which is fraud.  -It was very clear this waiter thought they would automatically get their 20% tip from our t",

SOOOO good!!  The sauce would have been overpowering for me and probably too much on the chicken, making it soggy, but with it on the side, the crispy chicken and fettucine could shine through and I added the sauce as I wanted.    Also, the bartender was so friendly and nice and totally made all of our weird requests seem like no big deal.  Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Delicious drunk food but extremely pricey even for the Strip.  Typical \"American\" style pizza.  Not NYC.  Not Chi Town.  The pies are, dare I say, Pizza Hut on steroids.  Chewy, bready crust slathered with sauce, generously topped with quality ingredients, finished with an almost excessive amount of cheese.   Over the top in True Vegas Strip fashion.  Sauces are bold and flavorful.  The pies are well seasoned and not excessively oily thanks to the fresh (not processed) cheeses.  The \"Miles 10 Meat\" pizza with its outstanding three meat bolognese sauce and toppings of prosciutto, pepperoni pancetta, sausage, bacon, mortadella and cappacola toppings is a meat lovers delight.  The \"Mushroom Ragu\" is another standout.  The perfect mix of earthy mushrooms paired with creamy, melted, fresh mozzarella.  All is not perfect, the crust in the middle of every pie so far has been soft from excessive sauce.  It becomes the stuff of legend if you like to indulge on cold pizza the next morning.  You can build your own pie from an extensive list of ingredients.  Slices are also offered along with salads, pastas, and sandwiches.  Service is fast and friendly.  Very good selection of beers on tap or by the bottle.  Prices are higher than it's Mandalay Place neighbors.  Strip indulgence comes at a price:  $19 for a 12\" pie, $30 for an 18\"; build your own starting at $15 (12\"), $23 (18\") adding $2 per topping.  Recommended.",

    "text": "I discovered Slice on a recent 5 day trip to Vegas.  I went there 3 times.  Since The Strip is primarily a meat eaters paradise full of overpriced tourist traps, I was particularly thrilled to find Slice as a reasonably affordable vegan & vegetarian option.      Their roasted cauliflower is served in a cast iron skillet and is drenched in an amazing pesto sauce.  It is an amazing appetizer.  The Titan Veggie Burger was delicious.  The black bean patty was tasty and the \"secret\" sauce was a nice touch.    The pizza was just the way I like it - thin crust, not greasy, with a good sauce.  I had a basic cheese & mushrooms pizza.  My wife had the vegan pizza with shredded daiya which she gave two thumbs up to.  Sometimes places put too much daiya on vegan pizzas, but this one had just the right amount.  To top it all off, they have a top notch beer selection.  Lots of wonderful west coast craft beer choices.  The servers and bartenders were very friendly, which was a departure from most of the other places I visited in Vegas during this trip.  They are located in the Mandalay Bay Shoppes.  Check 'em out!",

Billed as a space for \"Fun Italian Dining\" with a take-out station to the left and bar-full of craft brews tucked behind it was just moments before 7:00pm that I took my seat and with the majority of diners tourists with small children the scene was decidedly rambunctious, a duo of servers including the young woman in charge of my table clearly struggling to keep pace with large orders despite efficient back-servers helping to bus tables and refill water.  Unapologetically overpriced like the majority of Strip-side dining it was only after a few questions regarding the possibility of a half-and-half pizza (no for specialties, okay if you build-your-own) plus  a description of the daily specials that I eventually placed an overzealous order and with an appetizer slice of foldable New York style thin-crust quickly arriving from the exterior facing window my first taste was quite favorable, the gentle crunch and pliable crumb on par with that at Pop-Up or Secret beneath a subtly sweet sauce and bubbling fresh mozzarella.  Moving next to mundane garlic bread that no Italian mother would likely lay claim to it was fast on the thick loaf's heels that my gourmet pizza would arrive and with ample toppings showing a keen eye for balance over the nearly cracker thin crust the meal was soon back on good footing, the punchy sour cream a particularly inspired pairing to mellow the marinated artichokes and herbal topnotes from the pesto and fresh basil.  At this point just shy of my gift-certificate minimum I was left with a decision between the restaurant's signature chocolate cake, a glorified brownie sundae, or balls of fried dough and opting for the later with a sidecar of caramel I'm confident to say I made the right choice - each of the seven cue-ball sized doughnuts perfectly crisp and virtually oiless beneath a hefty shake of cinnamon sugar as the duo of sauces jockeyed for position on the tongue's already overcrowded sweetness receptors.  Dramatically overpriced without the benefit of a 2/3 discount but featuring a more than competent slice along with the best Zeppoli I've yet to find in Las Vegas there are certainly worse options for quick casual dining on the strip and although neither service nor setting are likely to win any awards I'd happily come back to explore more of the menu if armed with another coupon, a distinct likelihood considering the general dearth of quality on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> ever since the rest of Mandalay Bay pulled out several months ago.",

Build your own Pasta seemed like a good choice besides Pizza, but I was wrong. I chose spaghetti, bologonese sauce (meat sauce), meatballs and mushrooms for my pasta. It came out to around $22 - 24 for the pasta and those two added ingredients. While the spaghetti and sauce tasted fine, it wasn't hot, it was semi warm, and everything else that came with it. The meat balls tasted like frozen meat balls from the market, it was also warm like the pasta.  All in all, I didn't like the pasta, maybe I will opt for a slice of pizza instead.",

The truffle style fries, the Salad romelias (one of the best salads I have ever had), buffalo pizza & pesto pasta is to die for! So freaking good we went three times while in Vegas! My one complaint was that my vegan pasta came with parmesan cheese on it. When I asked the waitress said it wasn't cheese. I looked closer & it was melting like cheese. So I asked again & sure enough. Cheese. It took over 30 minutes to get my pasta back the right way. That was a huge bummer.  Other than that mix up, it is an amazing vegan paradise!",

She was pretty busy when we were there but never lacked attentiveness or professionalism at any time the fact that she was busy didnt even seem to bother her. The atmosphere is pretty cool here and a great option for a fun pizza place with the family. Super happy we chose to eat here for dinner! If you try it out ask for Allisha to be your server and tip her well she deserves it !! Thank you Allisha and Chefs at Slice of Vegas !",

Ordered a large pizza for family to share. Hot, cheesy, YUM! Ordered the cookie skillet dessert. Amazing way to finish our meal! Caramelized, candied nuts, ice cream and whip on top of a cookie!!!

    "text": "I was SO excited for this place because I had a bad craving for pizza but I am vegan, so it wasn't something that's easy to come by! Unfortunately, I was really bummed out and disappointed by the time we left.  We ordered a few things, including the bruschetta, fettuccini with pesto and veggies (vegan), garlic bread (vegan), and lamb sliders.   The waiter came back to our table and informed us that they ran out of lamb sliders and vegan cheese (daiya cheese). Needless to say, I didn't get my vegan pizza or cheese on my garlic bread. Apparently they get their shipments on Tuesdays, and we came on a Monday.  The food comes out, and we notice a few things. The bruschetta was a few soft pieces of bread with diced tomatoes...on the side. So that was interesting. We informed the waiter that they can take it back because we weren't going to pay $10 for what we got. The waiter replied with a really stern \"That's how we make our bruschetta here.\" He ended up taking it back, but I'm not too sure if he removed it from the bill or not.   I got my pesto fettuccini with artichoke, mushroom, sundried tomatoes and basil. It came with a rock hard piece of bread, maybe something that would have been better for the bruschetta if it weren't so stale. The fettuccini wasn't cooked all the way through. The pesto was really good, it's hard to find pesto as a vegan without any dairy in it so I'm glad I could get that at least.   I forgot to mention that as he was taking our orders he asked if I wanted the garlic bread out at the same time as the entrees, I told him as soon as possible would be awesome. We got halfway through our meal by the time I realized he forgot to put the order in. We called him back to the table and sure enough he did forget. The garlic bread was good, but not $8 good. Like, good enough and probably similar prep in your kitchen within a few minutes. It came with 4 pieces of the same bread as the bruschetta. Like I previously said, soft sliced bread. There was pesto on top which had a good taste, and a whole head of garlic on the side that I must have been too dull to realize that maybe it was something that I had to put on the bread to literally make it garlic bread.   Honestly, this place might have been really good because the menu seems awesome but I won't be going here again unfortunately.",

They have a Happy Hour that runs during the work week.  Other than that, Slice of Vegas would probably be my dinner pick based off of sheer convenience for when I'm being utterly lazy and don't want to walk too far to go anywhere. It really wouldn't be my first, second, or third pick for pizza on the Strip but gets the job done when you are in need. It's not bad pizza, just a greasy knife-and-fork pizza that doesn't leave any lasting impressions of pizza happiness in your mind. (Pin Up Pizza does for me!)  Kudos to these guys for a Yelp discount. As always, expect Strip pricing for anything here, so pricing seems exorbitant for the pizza quality that you get here. Stop by if you are on your death bed from hunger and need a pick-me-up before the next activity on your to-do list.",

A sub set of us thought, well they may not be able To to take 20 so 6 adults and 5 kids thought we would still go and try to get two separate tables. We got there and the place was empty.  We asked to be seated and she was like we don't have room! We looked around, there literally may have been 4 people in there. We asked about split tables.. no... we then mentioned we had a reservation but the courts are ALL running behind. She said they only had two waiters and they had a bunch of reservations starting in. 20 min... wait 2 waiters and we had a party of 20 people coming originally!  She finally went and asked the manager after us pressing, the kids were starving, but one of the parents went to the burger bar next door and they sat us right away and were friendly, got all our orders right and good food.",

They have happy hour Monday through Thursday from 3pm- 6pm.   This kid friendly restaurant is our go to spot when we are at Mandalay Bay.   The staff is really friendly and attentive and they always take care of us when we come in.   They have free Valet downstairs at the shoppes valet, which is perfect because I'm a local and go out of my way to come here a few times a month.",

    "text": "A caveat, I didn't have any pizza.  I actually had lunch @ Julian Serrano Tapas at the Aria about 1.5 hrs before coming here, so I was already full.    The GF remembered this place while wandering from Mandalay Bay to Luxor the previous time we were in Vegas.  It was already closed by the time we wandered through, but she had bookmarked this spot for dinner next time out.  Well, we finally made it back and we came over here from the Vdara.  We actually arrived at 5:30pm so we hit happy hour, which is 1/2 off select booze and select appetizers, as well as individual slices.  This included vegan versions of some of the apps, which was great.  I ended up ordering Not Your Mamma's Garlic Bread and Sweet Potato Fries tossed in truffle oil.  Since they were half off, why not get both?    The Garlic Bread was fantastic...thick slices of bread and instead of butter and garlic, Slice of Vegas topped it with an almond based pesto that was quite tasty.  They served it with a side of a roast garlic bulb, which you could drop a knife into and grab a clove like it was butter.  That roast garlic but this over the top.  The Sweet Potato fries weren't anything special, but you could smell the truffle oil they tossed it in after.  It wasn't a huge amount, they probably drizzled it and gave it a few tosses, but it was plentiful as a whole and delicious.  Their pies were a little pricey; 12\" for $19.  I did try the crust on my GF's Vegan Buffalo Chicken pizza and it was cooked very well.  She loved it; but I didn't really taste the toppings itself so other than the crust, I can't comment on if it was good or not.    Service was friendly and excellent.  The waitress was very patient. happy, and cheerful when assuring us that the ranch dip that came with the fries is vegan.  I'm definitely coming back, but this time I'm going to order a pizza for myself or, if I hit happy hour again, get a slice.",

The pizza looked appealing and had that essential layer of grease but fell short of what I'd even consider passable pizza ala Sbarro. (Setting the bar really, really low).   The cheese, sauce and toppings were all tasty however since the pizza had been setting out and they don't reheat it prior to serving, the cheese got hard and lost its hold onto the crust.   The crust was the real disappointment though. The crust had no rise and no chew but it wasn't thin crust. It was a dense crust with a thin ring around similar to what I would expect at a high school cafeteria. On top of that the crust was burnt on the bottom, but not in the good way like you'd expect from a Napoletana pizza. This just had a crispy exterior and a light acrid flavor.   It's not really fair to judge a whole restaurant based on a slice from the counter so take this review with a shaker of salt.",

    "text": "Slice of Vegas has a lot of vegan options (a full page of the menu) that range from appetizers, salads, pizzas, sandwiches and pasta dishes so you will surely find something here if your vegan and hungry. This location is located inside Mandalay Bay, in their forum shops across from the Lush store. This is a bar restaurant and they have tons of tvs so you can watch whatever sports games you desire, but it is a loud environment so take that into consideration before you bring grandma down here, unless she likes to party. Haha  We decided on the fries with vegan ranch and ketchup, the vegan garlic bread, and the vegan BBQ \"chicken\" pizza to share. The fries were the skinny cut fries but cooked perfectly and not overly salted. The garlic bread was served with a full head of roasted garlic on the side to smear over the bread which was toasted perfectly and had a pesto spread on top. The BBQ chicken pizza was actually delicious even though daiya cheese is not our favorite, the crust was crispy but not burned, the onions and the micro basil on top made the pizza. Our server was awesome, attentive but not overly annoying and even though she was busy, we had all we needed. This was a great place to discover while out and about. They also have happy hour from 3-6 so half price appetizers!!",

The Bills/Raiders game just started and I was looking desperately for a decent bar that was showing the game. I had previously visited 3 bars but the TV's were either small or scarce. As I walked into Slice of Vegas, I noticed that it was impossible to have a bad seat so a friend and I decided to have a seat at the bar. I asked if one of the TV's in front of us could be changed to the game and the bartender kindly obliged. I checked in via Yelp and received a 15% discount. I knew right then that I was at the perfect place.  When I found out they offered pizza by the slice, I decided to order a pepperoni along with some Stella. It was a blissful 3 hours. The bartenders and manager were really friendly and funny. If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely return for some yummy bar food, beer, and football.",

My girlfriend got a chicken Parmesan pasta dish that I also liked a lot. They don't go wrong with the food here.  SERVICE: 5/5 My first time here had very poor service. The owner reached out to me after hearing about my experience and offered me to come back again for another meal on them to give them another chance. They had me set up a reservation so they know exactly when I was coming and they knew exactly who I was when I walked in. We had a very nice, bubbly waitress, Taylor, who was very pleasant. She knew her beers, which made it easy for me to pick mine for their large list of choices. I was very pleased with this most recent experience, but I guess the real test of their service comes to when I come a third time to see if they treat me the same as this.  FACILITY: 3/5 No opinions changed about the facility, but I will say Mandalay Bay is certainly a nice hotel.  VALUE: 3/5 No opinions changed about the value.  4/5, Would considering eating here again.",

    "text": "Decent, for \"NY style\" pizza this far away from NY. Slice is in the Shops of Mandalay Bay (the connector mall between Mandalay and Luxor) and next door to Burger Bar. Generally, I'd say if you're trying to decide where to eat Burger Bar is way better but I had lunch there recently and wanted something different.   The interior is nice enough, with mostly booth style seating that should accommodate groups well. For once the person seating me didn't ask \"oh, just one? Do you want to sit at the bar?\" which was nice, because no I do not want to sit at the bar. The menu is your standard Italian offering - lasagna, build your own pasta and pizza. Because it's called \"Slice\" and not \"Pasta\" I had pizza.  First, the crust is really good - nice and crisp with a little chew. I'll agree with a few other reviewers that their sauce is pretty bland - it's just lacking in flavor, period so plan to use the shakers of oregano and hot peppers. Overall, it wasn't as good as the slice I had at Sal's in NY but it was better than the garbage at Famous Original Ray's so a-ok.  Service was a-ok too. My food came quickly but I wasn't checked on after - the standard \"single diner\" treatment again.....",

I think this was one of our favorite easy casual spots for grabbing a beer and a snack. My son (9 yrs old) loved the wings and pizza! I would classify the atmosphere kind of like a family friendly sports bar. I'm sure it can get loud during sports games, but we didn't experience any crowds or noise.

We always have great service and they have awesome music playing on the restaurant juke box, BUT when 2 salads and 2 drinks total up to over $50 with tip, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. BEST ADVICE: come during happy hour and eat off that menu. Otherwise, it is wayyyy overpriced for a pizza place. The vegan chick'n wings are good and reminiscent of cafeteria chicken Mcnuggets. My sister, the vegan, likes the meatless meatball sub with fries. For the non-vegan food, the Caprese salad is delicious, but adding some extra protein will cost you - a lot. I really wasn't that impressed with the pizza, and none of us ordered it again after our first visit. Overall, lots of options for vegans but with a hefty price tag.",

This little gem is hidden in the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay and we wandered in during their happy hour from 3 to 6p. If you have ever been to Vegas you know that prices are all over the place and the majority of places range on the pricier end. Looking at the menu, SOV is also one of those places but during happy hour, all drafts, slices, and select apps are half off. SCORE.   We posted up at the bar and had two bartenders during our venture here - both were lively, super friendly, and attentive. We order two slices of pepperoni and sausage plus their mild wings and a few beers. The slices were large and foldable - not quite NY style huge but close enough for me. The sausage had great flavor and the crust was just slightly crispy... exactly how I like it. The wings were fantastic. Period. Crispy outside. Juicy inside. Mild sauce had great flavor without being too spicy. In fact, there were so good we ordered a second batch and stuffed ourselves full.   This bar had a great local selection as well - plenty of Las Vegas brews as well as a handful of domestics and other well- known craft breweries. Looking at the menu, I was tempted to order the Miles 10 Meat pizza but didn't have the stomach to do it.... seriously, I was so damn full. But the Miles 10 is cheese and 10 meats. Yes 10 MEATS and no stupid veggies to ruin the heart attack pie. Topped with proscuitto, capicola, pork, bacon, and more, this is definitely going to be a go to spot of mine next time I'm in Vegas just for that pizza.   The place is pretty small (but hey, it's located inside shops) and I hated to see it closed at 11pm. Maybe it was just the time of year we were there, I'm not sure. But all in all, if you are looking to grab a beer and some grub, this is definitely a spot to go - heads up, be sure to go during happy hour. The wings we received, while delicious, we $5.50 for six of them meaning they are $11 normally. Holy hell. But hey, when in Vegas....",

She decided to come to this place since there was a lot of vegan choices for her. Which I love that this restaurant does this.  We decided to order:  Not your mamma's garlic bread-the bread had roasted garlic with olive oil and pesto. I love pesto. It was super yummy. However, I didn't think it was worth 8 buck but don't get me wrong it was delicious.  House shoestring's fries: we decided to get our fries with garlic and rosemary. Fries are fries. Can't go wrong with them.   Both appetizers were from the vegan menu which was great so we all got to share together.   Switching over to the meat-eater menu:  Choked pig pizza-we ended up going with 18 in. It was very good. Thin crust just the way I love my pizza. All the ingredient all came together really well. The pesto, the mozzarella cheese, the tomatoes, the bacon, THE BACON, haha was yummy!   Overall, good stuff.",

    "text": "Wow. I'm actually kinda shocked this place has a good amount of bad reviews.   This is one of my more favorite places to go out of my way for in Vegas for many reasons:  - It's easy to get to. Since it's on the Luxor side of the bridge to Mandalay, don't even bother with the nightmarish Mandalay Bay parking lot, and opt for super easy parking on the Luxor upper parking deck. It always seems to be a shorter and easier walk.  - They have an AWESOME VEGAN MENU with so many amazing offerings. I'm so glad they are advertising this now because before it was kind of by word of mouth only.  The vegan meatballs are a must! You can also get GLUTEN-FREE pizza, although it's only offered in one size (I believe 10\") and does take a bit longer for them to make. They use Daiya Cheese, which is the best! They'll also add it to your vegan salads and other dishes if you ask nicely.  - Great beer selection. Lots of imported stuff. Lots of good stuff on tap. Read the blackboard for the latest.  - They have a to-go window. Convenient!  - Wait staff is friendly, but yes, a little slow. This place gets busy though, and there is a back room where they have a lot of parties from the conference goers. So most of the available wait staff is stuck having to deal with that. No completely their fault. They could do with one less person at the front.  NEWS ALERT FOR THE VEGANS: was told by the waitress last night that the chocolate cake, cheesecake, and the zeppoli (from the normal dessert menu listed on the coffee cans at your table) are all VEGAN! Don't miss out on these.",

We order steak hash, pieces of steak toss with season potato in a skillet topped with two over easy eggs and served with toast. This was really good and the steak wasn't chewy and nasty. Seasoned potato, good.   We figure that since this place is called Slice of Vegas, we should try their pizza, 12 inch pepperoni. Pizza was pack with flavor BUT the pepperoni was salty and made the pizza really greasy. We had to ask for napkins to daub the grease off. The grease turned me off, it made the pizza soggy because of the grease. Ugh.",

    "text": "FYI, this is located in the Shops at Mandalay, across from LUSH.  It might be easier to get here via Luxor than the Mandalay parking garage.....   I hit up this place with a Groupon in tow.  I was here on a mission -- try the vegan pizza.  Sat at the bar, ordered a (crazy expensive) beer, and ordered the 18\" vegan \"faux pie\" pizza to share with the BF.  Pro tip: the 12\" pizzas are TINY and a rip off at $20 each.  For $30, the 18\" pizzas are still really pricey, but at least you can feed 4 people off of it. (Or two people with plenty to take home!)  The pizza was super tasty - good crispy crust, nice sauce, good vegan (Daiya) cheese to veg to crust ratio.  If I didn't have to fight my way through the hot mess that is trying to park at Mandalay Bay, and it weren't so expensive, I would eat here all the time! That said, I probably won't frequent this place due to those problems.  They have a great selection of very expensive beers (I think the cheapest is a $6 bud light equivalent), but that's probably par for the course at a casino.  They have a few good quality drafts (Stone IPA!) and lots of good bottles.  They also have a few vegan/veganizable pasta options ($12+) and salads ($10).  Pizza was delicious leftover cold the next day, so if you're staying at Mandalay, just get the large and eat the rest when you're hungover then next morning.  Service was Ok, not lacking nor exceptional.  No restroom.  There are lots of TVs for sports watching (did you know there's a CrossFit Olympics?! that's what was on while I was there.  Nothing helps you work up an appetite like watching impossibly thin and muscled women doing 500 deadlifts and pullups, amirite??)",

My fiance was very specific about tri cutting her slices and light on this heavy on that and despite the five people behind us, she kept a smile on her face and said absolutely. We ordered five slices because we didnt want to wait for a whole pizza so we paid twice what we could've if we were fifteen minutes patient. I wanted my pizza pronto! The pizza once perfectly customized had good flavor but pepperoni was a bit salty. Try shrimp with garlic...mmmm....Great service not easy on pocket.   Restaurant we dined in a couple days later. Hostess was friendly and server was very attentive as well. We orderd the capri sandwhich with garlic fries ((delicious)) .  My boo ordered the feducinni alfredo with marinara and meatballs extra cheese , She enjoyed it as well. We couldnt resist so we also ordered a loaded slice sliced in half. Tasty but a little cold by the time we ate it,   Oh and they have a jukebox.,make everyone listen to what you wanna hear,,,awesome!  We will be going back for a quick bite",

    "text": "My family was staying at Mandalay Bay for my son's wedding in the Vegas area so we decided to have the rehearsal dinner in the Marquee Room in Slice of Vegas restaurant.  We loved the casual decor of the room and and the convenience for all the guest because it is located right in the hotel.   When I called to reserve the room I spoke with Tiffany Easton, the Group Sales Manager, who was wonderful to deal with.  I contacted her about 3 months before the dinner by phone (I live in NY) and she couldn't have been more helpful.  If she wasn't available when I called she always quick in getting back to me.  There was an extensive menu to choose from (much more than the  menu in the regular part of the restaurant)  and the food was very good (we had several appetizers, pastas and entrees and everything was good except the shrimp scampi was too chewy) .  The servers were excellent and very attentive.  When the dinner was over they let use use the room for another hour over what was contracted for so that other friends and family could stop in and spend some time with my son and his bride to be.    We had a wonderful time and I just want to thank Tiffany and the servers for making it a great night.",

    "text": "Horrible experience! Found this place while we were walking between casinos. They looked open so we walked in and sat at the bar. We could tell the bartender was busy but she took care of us pretty quickly and got our order in and got us some drinks. We were hungry so we ordered a pizza and some fries. After 40 minutes it was apparent there was something wrong in the kitchen. No one had a pizza at their table.  A few finally came out and they were for people who came in 15 minutes after us!  So, after an hour of waiting, with no one coming to check on us or tell us anything i asked the manager, Christy, about the status of our order. She was completely unprofessional and rude. According to her they were technically closed and re opened to accommodate \"your group\" and they were shorthanded. We should be patient and grateful that they were serving us.  WHAT!?  I was not part of any group that caused her back up. And furthermore, lady, you were not accommodating me, you reopened cause you saw a chance to make some money. If you didn't have the manpower, CHRISTY, you shouldn't have opened.  Minimum you should APOLOGIZE and check on my freaking order. And if you were having issues you should have stopped by sooner to let us know. Horrible customer service.  Will never go back and will warn EVERYONE.",

I love the atmosphere and the fact that you can control the music with just a simple app on your smart phone.  It's a fun, casual place to hang out, watch some sports and enjoy delicious Italian cuisine.",

    "text": "Wow!  Came in during Happy Hour after a Thanksgiving meal so I can't rate the food.  The stars are about the service/mgmt.  I was watching NFL, so I ordered the $10 sprite with some seagrams.  Happy Hour ran until 6pm, so at 5:55 pm, I ordered a Happy Hour beer ($5).  The bartender (tatted up chick) said Happy Hour was over because the clock on the computer/cash register thing read 6pm.  I showed her my world clock smart phone at 5:56 pm.  Said there was nothing she could do.  I get it...no auhthority.  So, I asked to speak to the manager (short dude with a beard that needed a hair net).  10 min later after seating a few parties and getiing ice waters he came over.  I explained the issue with the clock, and he completely acted like a arse!  Basically said there was nothing he could do.  A manager can give free food and beers, let alone bypass or void a beer and charge $5.  I called him out as weak and he asked me to leave.  He was all offended and hurt that someone would question his poor mgmnt.  Prob cause most people are tourists and he'll/they'll never see each other again  Do your job man!  I come to Vegas all the time.  I've already told my local people not to go, but most hadn't even heard of the place.  If I was the manager, I would have smiled, apologised and given the customer a beer for Happy Hour prices during Happy Hour times.  By the way....he never pulled out his own smartphone to check.  Weak....and he manages people???",
