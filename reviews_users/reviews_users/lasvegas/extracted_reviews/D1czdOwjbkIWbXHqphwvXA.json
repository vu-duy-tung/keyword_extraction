    "text": "A really nice soul food place. A lot of other soul food restaurants in Las Vegas have very cramped dining rooms (Gritz, Seven Seas) but this place is very spacious, clean and the walls are covered with art, family photos and posters of Black heroes like Martin Luther King Jr and President Obama.  I want to give this place three stars. The food was pre-made and reheated in a microwave, but it was still good. Still, it's always disappointing to have your plate of soulfood goodness put down in front of you and your mac and cheese is still holding the same shape as the container it was stored in.  I'm giving them four stars because of the ambiance and their stellar service. Our waiter appeared to be working the place by himself but he was attentive, very polite and knowledgeable about the menu. He offered a discount if we gave a great Yelp review, so think of that when you look at other reviews.  One dining partner ordered the veggie plate, which is basically cornbread and your choice of three sides. One of her three sides chosen was fried cabbage and our waiter stated it's made with turkey bacon (there is a sign up that says their food is made w/turkey instead of pork when possible). She was disappointed but I think its great that they're at least trying to cut back on sodium and fat by using healthier alternatives.  2nd dining partner had the meatloaf which included two sides. 3rd dining partner had  the oxtails smothered in gravy that were so delicious he threatened violence if we dared to touch his plate when he went outside to take a phone call.  I had the spicy chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. I always order mac and cheese at any soul food place I go to; it's not a real soul food restaurant unless you have bomb-ass mac and cheese. EllaEm's was good, but nothing I'd go out of my way to eat again. Since it was reheated, it wasn't melty and gooey, but it wasn't bad either. The chicken was spicy, crunchy and a nice piece of meat, but the only thing on my bread was tomato and lettuce. No sauce, no nothing, not even mayo. I hope I'm not the only one who thinks that's odd.  I'm not itching to go back, but this place is definitely worth a second try.",

The catfish was great, the mashed potatoes were delicious. I had the chicken gravy on my mashed potatoes. The Mac cheese was very disappointing as were the greens. The greens had too much of the stems left on them and the Mac cheese was dry and no cheese flavor. The server was really nice but unfortunately the service was extremely slow. They should also greet guest when they come in as we were unsure if we should stand in line and place the order for here or if we should sit and wait for the server. The servers kept passing us by while we sat so my daughter stood in line and then asked if we had to give the order and then sit down. Other guest were confused as well. I will still come again but may just have my order to go.",

The cabbage and greens were the best I have ever had (please don't tell my mom and Granny). The mac and cheese was homemade and so good! The yams made me long for Thanksgiving!

Everything was dellicous the only downside if you can even call it that is the small potion of cornbread.  Maybe their trying to help us save on calories? lol I  could tell by looking at it that it was going to be awesome which it was. Next time I'll  order more cornbread I was in a bit of a hurry due to having goceries in the car.",

I'm from the south and all the food taste just like my grandmother, great grandmother, mom aunts and uncles made the food. The collard greens,black eye peas, yams macaroni and cheese were absolutely the bomb. I'm a vegetable girl but I tried to the meatloaf, catfish and shrimp and they were good also. I've been telling everyone that if you go to Vegas you have to stop at Ellaem's. Staff was professional and the music was definitely on  point. After trying on buffet on the strip that was absolutely horrible and over priced I had to go back to my roots SOUL FOOD!!! awesome experience and I will definitely return",

    "text": "Hands down best soul food joint I've had yet. There are still a couple I haven't tried in Vegas. So as of now this place takes the lead!  They are voted \"Best soul food restaurant in Las Vegas\" and they do live up to that reputation. When you first walk in, it's kind of small but had a homey comfy feel. The ladies there were very warm and welcoming. Advising us we can take a seat where ever we feel comfortable. Service was excellent. Someone came and got our drinks and order real quick.  I ordered the smothered chicken, white meat. It comes with 3 sides & also cornbread. I got -- mashed potatoes, greens, & Mac n cheese. And oh my goodness. The mashed potatoes were one of the best I ever had. Idk what they put in it but it was so creamy and the gravy accented the mashed potatoes just right. The greens were pretty alright, nothing special about them though. Mac n cheese was da bomb! It had just the right amount of cheesiness. Now let me tell you about the chicken! The chicken was perfection. Even tho it was fried, it wasn't dry, it was so moist! I do recommend getting the white meat instead of dark because it does make a difference on the taste.   The beau got the chicken and waffles. It doesn't come with sides but it does come with 3 chicken wings, eggs (your choice of how it's cooked) & comes with corn bread as well. The portions are large so he could barely finish his 3rd chicken. He loved and thought the chicken was delicious as well.   I'm impressed with this restaurant & will probably return when I need a little Soul in me. Lol",

Simply awesome!  Best fried chicken in Vegas hands down!  The ribs were also good. .. Good service with nice kids serving.  The young man that waited on us had a real passion for the food and it showed in his body language and words.  Dumbstruck going back soon!  Next is the catfish.  Saw it on a customers table.

    "text": "Soooooo Good!!!!   I had the catfish, greens, yams, mac n' cheese and corn bread. First of all the food was very hot when served. I love that! I hate getting a cold plate of food. The catfish was cooked so Right, not all greasy but fried perfectly. The greens and yams for SOOOOO delicious. The corn was the perfect amount of sweet, just Delicious and they serve it with room temp butter, not cold butter. Cold butter with bread doesn't make sense to me. The mac n cheese was just okay to me but only because I've had some phenomenal mac n cheese homemade. It was clean, the staff was courteous and helpful.   If you are in Vegas take the detour off the strip and hit this place up. They were named the best soul food restaurant in the Las Vegas area but I've been to several places in L.A. and they have been the best so far.   YUMMMMMYYY!",

Came for lunch, food was terrible, clean, no one there so service was quick enough although woman taking order had a bit of an attitude. Not sure where their chicken came from, but it was tasteless and the size of turkey wings not chicken. My son & I both ordered & opinions were the same on this. Other food too salty.  Can't say I'll return as I recall being a bit disappointed before as well with chitterling meal.",

The staff and customers are friendly as always but, the kitchen took the day off. Ticket times ran slow and quality was not how I remembered. The pork chops plate has been my favorite dish to order the past 6 years but what I was served had to have been the toughest pork chops in the city. Not to mention the price increase over the years. Sad for me to say but EllaEm's just lost my favorite spot in Las Vegas.",

I ordered to go today and the cabbage and red beans were not at all what you expect for \"southern food\". The red beans and rice tasted like a lot tomato sauce and seasoning salt over some ranch style or canned beans and very packaged tasting and not even zatarrains . We had cabbage as a side and it was just like they opened a bag of chopped cabbage from the salad section and tossed it in a vinaigrette dressing and quick cook microwave bacon and microwaved it together. It was not cooked down very much and quite crunchy. I tried giving them a chance since I was already passed another spot that gives us more consistency in quality and service. Ella Ems must have gone through some changes in the kitchen staff or something. It tasted like there were some corners cut this time. Two stars for the catfish in this overall experience.",

As she was at the register I went to her and said we have been sitting here and no one has taken our order. She proceeds to tell me that they are in the middle of a shift change and she thought someone else was helping us. Uh... she was. Duh! Never brought our drinks and then sat in my face and lied and when I was like I don't want to wait any longer she gives me the hand and tells me to have a nice day. Doing all of this in front of the owner's duaghter. I did let her know that I want happy with the extremely poor customer service I received. I do not think I will be going back there.

After waiting about another 20 minutes I get my to go order and if I would not have checked my bags none of my side orders which consists of collard greens yams and cabbage was not in the bag. I asked the person putting my things in the bag where my sides where she turned around with and attitude and so on here they are and placed them in bag. I told her oh my I would have got all the way home which is approximately 20 minutes from the location and been upset if my things that I paid for where not in the bag she rolled her eyes and said will that be all. I got home and my chicken was terribly dry my dressing was also terribly dry to the point I could barely swallow the food. This is the most terrible experience at a Soul food Restaurant any where I've ever been. And we only received to pieces of Fish for 17.99 unbelievable. Never Again in Life. And I have to drive back another 20 minutes to receive a refund.",

It took us over 45 minutes to get our food AFTER we ordered.   We showed up a few minutes after they opened at 11:00am. The service was a little bit slow. It that's ok--my friend and I hadn't seen each other for a few weeks so we were busy catching up. We both decided on their lunch special--you get your main dish and then two sides. My friend had the fried catfish with mac and cheese and potato salad. Lemme tell you--that potato salad may be the best one I've ever had!  I chose the meatloaf with mac and cheese and fried cabbage.  With the meatloaf you have the choice of having it with gravy or a tomato sauce. Per the servers recommendation, I had mine with the tomato sauce. It wasn't bad...but I think I would have liked the gravy better. The mac and cheese...I had such high hopes for it and it definitely fell short. There wasn't much taste it at all.  The fried cabbage was dang tasty though--probably my favorite part of the meal.   All in all, it wasn't a bad experience.  I'd go back again but it's not a place I'm going to be like \"omg...we have to go here again, again and again\".",

You have to remove the bun in order to eat it. If I had known that, I would have just ordered the bbq rib dinner and got 3 sides with it!

    "text": "Are there any decent Soul Food restaurants in Vegas??? I've slowly lost any remaining hope after stopping in at EllaEm's. SOUL is something that our food most definitely was missing that evening  When we arrived, the restaurant was very clean and looked more inviting than other soul food spots we've dined at(Kathy's, M&M)even the items on the menu looked very appetizing....Looks were definitely deceiving here because after our waitress assured us that everything was delicious, wifey asked \"are your ribs juicy and fall-off-the-bone?\" \"Oh yeah\" she replied with a smile...about 10 seconds later, wifey sees liver and onions on the menu and she excitedly orders that instead. \"Oh, you know what? that's the only item we don't have\" waitress says.... Gee, thanks for the \"heads up\" on what you're out of.  So she orders the Ribs with 3 sides-mashed potatoes, yams, and mac and cheese and I go with one of their house specialities, Chicken and Waffles. While waiting for our order, we hear BEEP, BEEP, BEEP at least 4-5 times...yes,  that dreadful sound of the microwave was a definite\"Oh hell's no!\" moment....The cornbread comes out first, but not in huge squares as pictured in the menu, but more like 3-inch circles, 1/2 inch high....WTH? 4 and 5 star reviews????Really????  Some dude named Pedro was the only cook in the kitchen and I know for a fact, he didn't even take the time nor the patience to turn out tasty Soul Food....makes you wonder how much truth there is to the EllaEm's story and its two patriarchs, Ella Rea Gray, and Aem Upachak(photo of story included)  All of the sides and the waffles were definitely nuked,which made the waffles tough and spongy and the ribs were tough, dried out and not juicy at all. We won't be  coming back here...ever. Serving food like that is totally doing the two matriarchs a great injustice...ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(25/365) \"No soul at all\"",

My husband and I got a craving for some fried catfish, and being near our house and having it once before, we called this place for take out. Now, the food is good. Not outstanding but good and just a little pricey. Still, convenience and cravings win out. But this is my complaint, we called in an order for pick up. We wanted to avoid the wait and have a night in. Asked if it would be ready by 6:30, I called at called at 5:40, they said yes. My husband got there ten minutes late and he is still there waiting for our food thirty minutes later. Bad service? Yes...  *** update- after waiting thirty more minutes for our takeout, a food server just sets the bag of food in front of my husband without a word and walks away. No courtesy what so ever.",

I lived in Mississippi and I spent many weekends in New Orleans so I know what \"Soul Food\" is supposed to taste like. Anyhoot...The first time we patronized this establishment our food was less than we expected both in quality and was overpriced. So, we tried this place again thinking that our first visit was just a mediocre semi bad day. Unfortunately...the food was not palatable. The chicken was not completely done and you can take my word based on personal experience that if you eat chicken that is not completely baked or boiled or whatever you will get sick. Also...my cobbler was average at best and between 2 of us we still left half the desert uneaten. Oh well. At best this place is hit or miss and not much to write home about.",

The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because of the less than stellar service that we got from the young man.  First of all, he didn't know the menu.   He tried hard enough but needs help.  We ordered the German chocolate cake for dessert and he said that we had to pay for it before he will serve it.  WHAT?! In spite of that,  don't be surprised if you see us there.

    "text": "First off, I loved the whole atmosphere of this place! It's a real small, family owned spot that's kind of tucked away in a shopping center and easy to miss. This may just be me but the interior has a 50's diner kinda feel with the red & chrome which I thought was cool. They also keep their restaurant really clean and that's a huge plus.  We ended up going fry crazy haha. I went with the catfish and my wife picked the fried chicken, and let me tell you...they know how to fry food at this place! Both the chicken and fish were fried completely even to a perfect gold brown. The catfish was unbelievable! It's cooked just right with that \"oh, so good\" tender flakiness and their seasoning is dead on. Not too heavy with a little kick and just enough flavor to compliment the fish. The chicken was pretty dang good too but it had a slight flour taste which could probably even out with a little more salt. They aren't skimpy with portions either...alongside the fish or chicken, you get 3 sides and cornbread. Their mac n cheese is just ok but they have really good greens, red beans and the cornbread was definitely up in the top compared to most places in town.  Easily one of the top spots to go to if you're looking for good fried food! They have amazing food with a good selection and with the portions you get, the price is hard to beat. We went in at about 8pm on Friday and they were getting slammed with customers so I really think they could benefit from staying open a little later. It felt like we were being slightly rushed which is why I'd give them 4 stars but I'll definitely be coming back for more!",

It's so frustrating too because the food that is good is VERY good but other things that you think should be an easy lock in for any southern or soul food place aren't. Customer service is questionable at best...  The fried chicken, VERY GOOD. Crispy skin, juicy, etc. The mashed potatoes, VERY BAD. Lumpy, super thick, clumpy etc. Yams=yummy, greens, meh. Their meatloaf and side of veggies YUM!! Cornbread cakes - get extra lol. Their ribs have great flavor but the beef tastes \"cheap\" and/or frozen for too long. Their customer service has been friendly exactly half the time too lol - out of four visits fielding my way through the menu I'm not sure I want to go back because the customer service is so inconsistent. In fairness, one time I believe the cook or dishwasher (both?) took my order himself -- either way, there's a reason that some people are better at back of the house than front of the house. I think this place has great potential but even after sampling several things I'm still utterly undecided so I hope this helps you more than it's helped me lol.",

The service was great, the atmosphere hip, and everyone seemed to be happy to be there...both customers and staff.  Totally recommend this restaurant.",

There was one young lady \"I forgot her name\" cute young girl curly hair I think it was Amesha or Anisha not sure.  She was so extremely sweet and gave great suggestions on what to try.  The prices are very reasonable and food was great, I had the Oxtails yummers, black eyed peas, potato salad and greens all was soooo delicious.  My honey had the fried chicken, double mac & cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy also very good.  The place felt like you were at home enjoying a good meal.  I will for sure be back.  The only reason it is short a star is because we took the desserts to go and when we had a chance to taste it which was peach cobbler for me I didn't like it at all and my honey got german chocolate cake and he said it was ok.",

I ordered the Catfish lunch and a Fried Chicken dinner and I was very pleased  about what was placed in front of me. My Catfish was fresh ,very tender and fried perfectly. After concentrating on my fish I moved over to the Fried Chicken which was also tender , juicy and fried to perfection. I really liked the Chicken because it was lightly battered and had a nice crunchy bite. My sides were delicious especially the Greens, I really need to talk about the Greens. The Greens were flavorful, fresh and just a work of art ( I'm keeping it simple and clean). EllaEm's Soul Food has my vote. Try it! AW",

The steamed veggies were a treat because they tasted fresh and not mushy in any way.  We got a to go box and they got us water to go which was so sweet of them because it's over 113 degrees outside. They even left a sweet note on my bill. Definitely look forward to coming back here!",

The second night (I had to come back) my meal was meatloaf, yams, greens, red beans and rice.  The portions are so large that you have enough food for three meals. The flavor was excellent! If that wasn't enough, the hospitality and care from Pedro, Neyda, Jazz and Ms. Luxury would keep anyone coming back. Kindness goes a long way!!

Me and my sister stopped in for lunch, around noon it was perfect timing before the crowd started coming in.   We both ordered the Chicken wing and waffle special with 2 eggs. There is a bit of wait before the food actually came out (15 mins +) but they immediately brought corn muffins and generously replenished it after we scarfed it down. Goodness those muffins are soooo deliciously warrrrmm  The waffle was fluffy and warm (I prefer it a little more crispy) the chicken was moist and crispy thumbs up. The eggs cooked over easy also thumbs up. Mac and cheese was simple - cheesy and warm loved it. Side of rice & gravy (chicken) piping hot and good. They provided ranch and hot sauce so we were happy kids.  The service was amazing, Jazz was our server she really bought our experience really high. Attentive, quick and kind. We had boxes ready for us when we done along with to-go drinks for the road. Every single person working was great, I see why this place is THE BEST SOUL FOOD in Vegas. Great food greater customer service, will be back with more people for sure.",

    "text": "My fiance and I had a heavy craving for soul food and decided to try something closer to home rather than our usual spot.   We got there around 1:00pm give or take 5 minutes. We waited about 15 minutes since tables had to be cleaned. Which was no big deal, Sunday lunch rush I'm assuming. We got to choose where to sit which was great.   I loved the wall decore. It was very family-oriented and had an old school vibe with good culture behind each picture. But it got old after about an hour of staring, waiting for our food.   I ordered waffle and wings, the fiance ordered the fried smothered chicken, with chicken gravey, potatoes, and mac.  So an hour in for my chicken and wings and his smothered chicken. Started to get a little sour when other tables were getting their food at a faster rate, but I don't know their orders or wait time. There was a large party of 10 in also, which likely had an impact as well. So that's fine, as long as the food is good. Ya know, worth the wait.   Unfortunately it was dry. The waffle was amazing though! But the chicken was lackluster and appeared to be overcooked in the fryer. This occurred on both our plates. Although crispy and seasoned well, it needed a lot of gravy and syrup. The egg on the side was overdone also. I ordered sunny side, got something that was viaually akin to over easy, and ended up with no yolk.  The gravy was great and the sweet tea was good. My fiance enjoyed the mac. The corn bread was the absolute BEST part of our meal. Soft, moist, flavorful; everything it should be.   Another plus is that the waitress was wonderful. I have a feeling she felt bad for the wait since she kept refilling our drinks to the 9s and did her best to make sure we were taken care of. Good service on her end!   Overall, not impressed by the food, upset that I waited for an hour and fifteen, and hoping to one day give this place another chance if possible, if only for the for  bread.  I would have loved to try the sweet potato pie, and my fiance would have ordered another mac, but we didn't want to sit for another half hour of our only day off.",

They are one of the only restaurants that has oxtails so I have visited twice since then. The 2nd time the food was delicious. The 3rd time they didn't have oxtails ready and it would be over a 1 hour wait. When trying to order sides the waitress had to ask if they had certian sides available for the day. I think that they have great potential but as a business owner my advise would be to have the cooks come in a little bit earlier so that the full menu is available when they open for the day. I intended to order food for my whole family but they didn't want to have to wait. Unfortunately, they missed out on at least a couple of hundred dollars for that day.",

    "text": "This has to be one of the worst experiences ever with a restaurant. First, I called the establishment to place a order and was put on hold so long I had to hang up...twice.  After trying a third time I was able to actually place my order but unfortunately was told the item I wanted wasn't available. Switching my order , I was told 15-20 minutes and my food would be ready. Arriving at the location I found myself puzzled on why I had been left on hold that long twice yet only one person was in the dining area eating... While waiting I noticed the customer before me ordered what I previously had my mind set on yet was told it was unavailable,after questioning the cashier/host jokingly she responded saying the customer before me got the last order... Back to waiting, noticing no sense of urgency from the staff as you could tell they rather be elsewhere. You could hear the cooking staff arguing in the kitchen,after about a hour I received my food that looked like crap. 32$ for 2 waffles,3 pieces of over cooked baby chicken wings and a egg that should've been scrambled but was obviously hard boiled and smashed up. If this is indeed a family business that had been around for generations,the founder of this business would be turning in her grave if she were to witness the way her business is being ran.",

Somewhat unassuming and far from a 'hole in the wall'.   I stopped in for lunch with a couple of coworkers who told me to yelp us a place. The service was awesome just like it was last time. The food is made to order so it comes out absolutely piping hot. With that said, you will wait a few extra minutes for the freshness.   The service was great. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. We went in after the lunch hours so it was not very busy. They have about a dozen different lunch specials right at $10 or so.   I went with the fried chicken and it was very good. If I'm being completely honest, not the best fried chicken I've ever tasted but it was still very very good. And it being so fresh is a definite added bonus. The candied yams are phenomenal. The yams are few in number so I was glad it had 2 sides. I also got the collard greens and they were very tasty.  They give you a complimentary piece of cornbread as an appetizer and it's super tasty as well.   If you haven't been- go here. It's voted the best soul food in the valley and you'll see why.",

We will definitely be coming back.  Our sons loved the red Kool Aide, I had the sweet tea and our daughter had the lemonade. All the drinks were good. We also ordered a whole sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving. If you haven't been here you need to come. If we lived here I'd be here frequently.

The waitress was very attentive to our needs and made us feel right at home. I must say I'm no easy customer to please so when I say, I've had great service, the average person would consider it the BEST service.

    "text": "EllaEm's popped my soul food cherry, and since I have absolutely nothing to compare it to (besides the chicken and waffles at Roscoe's), I'm gonna say that this place is freaking delicious.   I ordered the fried catfish. It comes with any 3 sides of your choice. I originally chose the Mac & cheese, potato salad, and mashed potatoes with beef gravy, but our waitress said they were out of potato salad at the moment so I settled for the candied yams instead. My boyfriend ordered the Wingettes & Waffles, which is just chicken wings and a waffle.   The fried catfish was cooked great. It wasn't too oily at all. The Mac and cheese tasted no different from any other Mac and cheese but the mashed potatoes and candied yams were probably the best I ever had, and I don't even like yams lol. The portions of both the catfish and the sides were huge. So big that there was no way I could've finished it all no matter how hard I was trying. My boyfriend's chicken and waffles were also delicious. The waffle was kinda thin but it was still really flavorful to me. I didn't try the fried chicken wings by itself but the way they cook their chicken and their homemade waffle recipe made for a perfect combination.   About 15 minutes after we started eating, our waitress came back to our table with a side of potato salad for me, on the house, because she felt bad that they didn't have any when she took my order. So that was really nice. The potato salad was just okay though /: I actually felt kinda bad that I didn't like it more than I did since she was giving it to me for free and all lol.  I'd rate their service a 4.9 out of 5 though. Only because when we first walked in we were instantly confused. We weren't greeted at the door by a hostess or anything so we weren't sure if we were supposed to go up to the counter and order or wait to be seated or seat ourselves. (FYI you seat yourselves) Out waitress was really nice. She took care of us; never let our cups go empty, checked up on us an appropriate amount of times, made us feel comfortable and at home, and she even complimented me on my eyes lol. (I gave her an extra couple dollars for her tip for that one haha) By reading the reviews, I noticed a lot of people complaining about how \"slow\" their service is. I am wholeheartedly disagreeing with that. Yeah, they're not fast food restaurant speedy, but for the fact that they're actually COOKING their food made to order and for how much food they put on the plate, their service is undeserving of being called slow. But that's just my opinion.  All in all, very good. And I will definitely be going back again... and again and again and again lol.",

Since this was my first visit I asked the woman behind the counter what she recommended. I went with her recommendation and ordered the ox tails with collard greens, red beans and rice wth gravy.  I ordered my food to go because I left my boxer out of his crate and don't know if he will destroy anything.  Let me tell you every dish was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Beans, greens, oxtails and rice. The gravy was also delicious. The only thing I did not care for was the cornbread muffin. It is too sweet for my liking, it is closer to cornbread cake. If the cornbread was more savory I would have given 5 stars.   The staff yet needs to be evaluated from a dine in standpoint and I will do that on my next visit. Yes I will be back. This establishment is definitely worth visiting. What are you waiting for, go!  And now, the idis.....",

You can see right into their kitchen and I saw a Hispanic making the food so l was skeptical of what the food would taste like.  I was quickly disappointed as I found out their sweet tea wasn't home made.  I mean how can you have a \"soul food\" establishment without home brewed sweet ice tea???  Moving on, I got the ox tails with the sides of collard greens, Mac & cheese, rice w/gravy and corn bread muffin.  The ox tail and rice w/gravy was my favorite part of the meal.  The tender meat was falling off the bone with soft rice covered with homemade gravy (9.5/10).  The collards greens were ok.  I personally like my greens cooked a little longer (8/10).  I wasn't a big fan of their mac & cheese but then I'm picky about my mac & cheese.  I'm sure someone likes it that way (7/10). The cornbread tasted more like a cupcake than it did cornbread.  I think they used more flour than cornmeal in their mix.  My friend loved it since he likes cakes (7/10).  Would I come back?  Yes.",

    "text": "Terrible service. We were recommended this spot by a friend so we gave it a shot after a long day of apartment hunting. We walked in and immediately got a good vibe from this place. Good music playing, food smelled delicious, & we were the only other couple in the restaurant waiting for our food. Unfortunately we waited 1 hour 20 mins until we called it quits! Yes, over a hour! We were too busy looking at the houses &a apartments we saved on our phone to even notice we were waiting that long. The restaurant then had a little crowd and people started getting their food before us. And trust, we played out every explanation...there was no excuse for that terrible service. Things happen, I know...but at LEAST come to our table and let us know what the hold up is. So disappointed. I lowkey think they had a problem with us but I'm not going to get into that! Idk maybe they didn't, but you see, their service was so bad it's got me making up reasons in my head lol I mean there is no other explanation for their trash service. We walked out. I've been working on my temper too so I didn't make a scene. I told my friend about their trash service and he then replied \" oh yeah, they are hella slow man. I forgot to tell you that.\" Lol Order ahead if you dare to go to this place. We'll find another soul food spot though. MF got me hot!!!!",

It's a great place for a date, lunch with friends, family or co-workers. Normally spend time gossiping over a plate of authentic soul food. The cornbread here is buttery, fresh and baked to perfection. I can never get  enough of that. The entree comes with 2-3 sides which are plentiful.  They do not take long making your food at all. It's a very homestyle feel. The customer service is perfect. They aren't over bubbly, in your face or checking on you too much.   Ella Em's is outstanding! 5/5",

    "text": "I'm not very picky when it comes to food. I like to help out local businesses instead of the chain restaurants that have a a rep for using frozen foods and microwaves.   But in this instance I should have gone to KFC or Popeyes.  I called and placed a To-Go order for a fried chicken dinner.  I was told about 10-15 minute pick up time. It was closer to 35 minutes.  I asked for cup of water when I arrived and payed for my order.  I had to ask for it 2 more times before I got it. They weren't very busy. I had read other reviews that said service was lacking, so I kind of expected it.  Finally I got my food.  It smelled delicious.  My  drive home seemed eternal.  I got home opened my Styrofoam plates only to find that they had put the gravy on top of my 2 pieces of chicken, i had asked for it on the side.   Oh well, i thought, it could be worse.  And then it was. The gravy was incredibly salty.  My sides were bland.  And then I realized they forgot my peach cobbler. I called and they said I could go by and pick it up because they would not refund my $7.  At that point I should have left mediocre-enough alone. I picked up the medium cobbler. It turned out to be 2 small containers w canned peaches in lots of nectar and some soggy crust.  McDonald's apple pies would have been a better choice.  I spent almost $40 on this meal.  I am very disappointed and will not be returning.",

Also tried the fried fish - great!  Not too greasy.  Southern food wouldn't be complete without sides, and here, EllaEm's also shines. Collard greens, mac and cheese, red beans, black eyed peas - all excellent! IMO, the standout was the yams.    I didn't have a problem with the service here, unlike others' experience.  It was a bit on the slow side - so not good if you're in a time crunch. However, the staff are friendly.  I think this is a family business, which I'm always fond of supporting whenever possible.  Decor is casual, and the price isn't too bad (especially for Vegas standards).",

She made sure our drinks were always filled and her kind customer service made us return again to have a wonderful experience. Jas went above and beyond to make sure we had endless FRESH cornbread while we waited for our food and gave us a fresh batch for the road. I highly recommend asking for Jas as your server to have a wonderful experience like we did.",

I LOVE well made soul food, this was lackluster at best.I'll start with the rice since it aggravated me the MOST because how do you fudge up plain white rice? It was so mushy and gummy  also the gravy needs so umph! The Oxtails were decent nice size no complaints there however I'm an oxtails rice and gravy tour of gal so the rice kind of fucked up the meal for me.  The Mac n cheese was boo boo it taste like had been sitting in a refrigerator for quite a while! Also it seems as though they use those deluxe box pasta GROSS. Please don't pass the garbage sprinkled with cheddar cheese as southern Mac! Last Item was the yams all I have is an eh for those. I'm writing this review to remind myself never to try this place again!",

When we sat down a young man came to our table and didn't really greet us and asked for our drink order. I asked for a unsweetened tea and my boyfriend asked for a sweet tea-we got 2 sweet teas. Then he acted as if he were bothered that he had to get me an unsweetened tea. Then I noticed how much energy/enthusiasm as he was serving two young BLACK females. Very complimentary towards them even calling them his \"beautiful Nubian queens\" aha, I got it now. He was treating us poorly because we are an interracial couple. I guess I wasn't \"black enough\" for his liking.   I saw other ppl got cornbread while they were waiting for their meal and checked on-not us. I even saw him clock out and leave and didn't even bother to tell us that someone else was going to take over and that he was leaving. After waiting for a while another server saw we were waiting and introduced herself, got us cornbread and was shocked that no one offered that to us while we waited. She was nice and made up for the initial experience. I appreciate her efforts. The food was good (I prefer the Soul Food cafe).   But I am SO disappointed that people are so bothered by who I love. And that you are so bothered that you would go to such great lengths to make me feel so uncomfortable. I feel sorry for you. I feel sorry that you are so small minded. I feel sorry that you will never experience life outside of north Las Vegas. I feel sorry that my happiness makes you so uncomfortable. Most of all I feel sorry for anyone else you come in contact with at that restaurant that you don't seem worthy of your service-which you are getting paid to do-as they won't patronize an establishment due to your lack of intelligence.",

    "text": "I have visited twice. The first time, a young woman took my order. When that order came out I informed the young man (with his pants sagging) that they must have forgotten that the order came with three wings. The man sighed and chuckled as if I was wrong. I grabbed a menu off another table and informed the young man to which he apologized and quickly rectified the situation. The second time I visited with a friend. After about a 30 minute wait, other people who came in after I did received their meals. The young lady informed me that my meal was coming up. I would have believed her if it was not for the fact that individuals who came in after me was receiving their orders. Finally, another lady tells me the truth. She informed me that my ticket was lost, to which I replied that I was leaving (I'm out). The owner (watching the situation) sprang into action and resolved the situation. I would normally rate an establishment like this a negative star rating (if I could) based solely off of customer service; however, I believe with a well trained staff EllaEm's cannot only become a world class establishment, but also expand beyond the Las Vegas metro area. Lastly, despite the bad service the food is excellent; however, great food does not constitute customer loyalty.  MDE",

    "text": "Southern food is an art. I use the term southern, whereas EllaEm's and many of the cafes of this type in town use Soul Food. I believe they are synonymous as both southern and soul food share almost all aspects. They most unifying similarity is they are both born out of poverty, and this is what makes southern/soul food an art. It is easy to make a fantastic meal when you have the finest cuts of meat and important spices with which to flavor the food. However, when you have to create magic from the poorest cuts of meat, vegetables that are easy to grow and considered common, and your spice palate consist of little more than salt, pepper and broth that is the example of a True artist. It is easy to paint when you have all the paints and a fine canvas, but to create something out of nothing with almost nothing shows real talent.   EllaEm's is artistry on display. It is fine southern food with flavor to spare. This is not a diet conscious restaurant where calories can be counted. It is instead a representation of a culture where food is used as an offering of love, and often the best of times happen around a dinner table. There is little pomp, and no circumstances here, just good food at a reasonable price...well mostly reasonable.   On my first visit I had the fried chicken (dark meat), fried cabbage, red beans and rice, mashed potatoes and gravy, and two corn muffins (my heart will never forgive me). The chicken was excellent, very moist and fresh with a good crispy crust. My one of only two complaints from the evening was there were only two pieces of dark meat chicken. The sides made it more than enough for a fulfilling meal, but one more piece of chicken would have made me feel better about the order. The red beans and rice were good, but not great. The mashed potatoes with chicken gravy were to die for. I must return to have the chicken and waffles with chicken gravy (for which my heart will once again curse me). I had the fried cabbage at the suggestion of my friendly and courteous, albeit somewhat slow, server (second small complaint) . The cabbage was perhaps the best part of the meal, and would win hands down if not for the corn muffin. Go ahead and order two at the start because one is just not going to cut it.   I would like to give EllaEm's 4.5 stars because of the two small discrepancies I mentioned above. I rounded up instead of down because ElleEm's is exactly the type of business I, and I hope you, like to support. It is local owned, not in a fancy location, and providing a good service at a reasonable price. I big you if you are wanting a good meal with a distinct American cultural edge, chose ElleEm's over any one of the worthless and \"soulless\" chain restaurants which litter our city. It adds wonderfully to the burgeoning community Vegas has so long needed.",

    "text": "I went for lunch on Thursday afternoon and the place was packed! Great sign, usually, so my giddiness continued as I waited for my friend and hungrily watched other patrons place their orders and receive their lunches. The place is cute, clean, and comfortable. There were two large parties (one leaving, one ordering) when I came in. All in all a good vibe, good music in the background that still allowed for conversation, and smiles abound. I was excited!  It pretty much ended there. I really, really, really wanted to like this place. I would have preferred to have loved this place, but I would have settled for an \"I love you, but not in THAT way\" sort of conversation here.   Alas, I am not sure I want a second date.  First: The service was VERY slow. Yes, it's a small place. And mostly it was service with a smile. But it was slow. We all but flagged the waiter down to order our drinks. And then again to order lunch. He kept pointing out how slammed they were. I could see it, I sort of get it, but then there should be more help on the floor. He was genuinely kind and happy to help us, but it doesn't make up for the fact that once both of us were seated, it took 15 minutes-plus to finally let them know what we wanted to eat. Add to that the wait for the food itself? My hour lunch was approaching an hour and I hadn't had anything to eat yet.  Never got a drink refill. Had to ask for silverware. Getting the to-go boxes (I took those greens to go!) and the checks was OK, but then had to wait for the payments to be processed while watching the waiter do other things.  OK, OK, there were SOME good points.  Here we go... food. I decided to try the liver and onions. You get to choose three (huge portions here!) sides. I went with mac and cheese, collard greens, and fried cabbage. (Oy, I did not come here expecting to adhere to any diet, that's for sure!)  The large portion of liver was cooked perfectly but the cut was off. Too much connective tissue running through it. I'd rather smaller pieces cut away from the parts you can't chew/eat. It had a hint of a breading/coating on it that was not bad, not over the top. But I had a small bit where it was all flour. No bueno.  The collard greens were the best ever. Seriously. Eat them. (Insert \"Eat All The Greens! meme here.)  The mac was good, definitely homemade. I only tasted it because pasta is not my friend, but the flavors and composition were really decent. Not amazing, but decent.  The cabbage was, against all odds, really great. Too oily/buttery for MY tastes, but still managing not to be wilted and brown; it was bright, a tad crisp. Surprisingly good but slightly over on the grease scale for MY tastes (trying to be fair... it is, after all, \"fried cabbage!\").  S's massive portion of meatloaf with rice with gravy were good, she said, though the yams were a tad on the raw side. She also had the mac and agreed: good, yes, tasty, but nothing to write home about. (To go box for the food here, too, so that says a little something.)  Another thing I didn't love? The photos on the menu didn't seem to totally match the food. Not just like, \"hey, mine doesn't look like that,\" but in a \"they don't even offer that on their menu!\" sort of way. I felt cheated that I couldn't order cole slaw or green beans, even though they were so prominently displayed.  Huge portions of mostly OK-ish food. Smiley but slooooow service. Prices are fine based on portions, but when it's just OK? *sigh*   Just not excited about a return trip.",

We were there on a quiet afternoon and were amazed at how fantastic the food is and the service was just incredible.  One of the gals there saw me picking food off my husband's plate and brought me a serving of the same thing, gratis.    My southern hubby had the catfish plate and loved it, and we both loved the fried cabbage.  Not a southerner, I tried their cheeseburger - it was okay but there's a reason why this isn't a burger joint ;)  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I'll break down and try to deal with the southern obsession with frying everything ;)",

An older waitress totally ignored us for almost 20 minutes.   My wife & I took our daughter for the catfish & fried chicken that we always order.  The waitress went to every other table in the restaurant to check up & even cleared a table w/the dirty plates left from  previous customers directly across from us.  We told her we were ready to order & were ignored.  Then, another african american 3 top sat down & were immediately greeted w/a drink order & silverware.  We were never asked for drinks or greeted.  I work in the beverage industry at a major casino on the strip & would consider our experience a 1-10 score.  The waitress never acknowledged us & we will never dine there again in person.   Maybe order via phone & p/up so we won't have to remember this experience.  Sorry for the bad rating but a simple \"Hi, I'll be right with you & or What can I  get you to drink.\"   Would've made a big difference.  So, we went to the Poke Express & other local Asian restaurant & had a great lunch.  I don't think Ms. Ella would be proud of her horrible waitress that works Saturday days.",

This store gives a True taste of southern style food. I have brought many family and friends who visit from the east coast and they all are very pleased with the meal. The customer service is also great and I have never had any issues with this restaurant.

There was one waitress/hostess here when I came for lunch, so the service was a little slow but expected.   I got the $7 lunch special that comes with an entree choice, two sides, and cornbread. I had the fried chicken, which was decent but not great. I had a drumstick that was cooked to perfection, but a breast piece that was overly salty. Not sure why that was. I also got a chance to try the catfish that my coworker ordered and I would get that if I were to come back. Perfectly crisp and flavorful.  Among the sides I tried, the cabbage and yams were good, while the mac and cheese and collared green were just alright.  The cornbread was very moist with good texture as well.  If there were a 0.5 star rating, I would probably give EllaEm's a 3.5 overall. There are hits or misses on the menu. Also, some extra staff members to help with the service would be beneficial.",

The interior is very blues/jazzy feeling and it's located in a strip mall near Poke Express.   They had multiple different options available for their lunch specials. I opted for the Red Snapper with my sides being Fried Okra and Yams. The food is cooked fresh once you order which is always a wonderful touch. The portion sizes are also HUGE. My meal came with about 2-3 filets of fish and two soup sized bowls of sides. I really liked how the fish tasted and was cooked, but wish there was some type of spiced tartare sauce to go with it. The fried okra was very good, the breading wasn't overwhelming and it wasn't too salty. I really liked the yams. They had a type of sweet glaze on them which was very good.  I was very happy with this place. A nice little homey, southern fine in North Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Decided to visit EllaEm's this afternoon after learning that the place I wanted to visit was closed until Thursday. This was my third visit to the restaurant.  Their Lunch specials, starting at just over $12, are great value for the dollar. I had their smothered chicken, yams, Mac and cheese and rice and gravy. The portions were good but my yams were cold. I mentioned it to the staff and I was promptly brought out a replacement order; maybe heated and returned but it was right the second time.  I wasn't a fan of their Mac and cheese but everything else was pretty good.  I may not rush back to EllaEm's but they earned repeat business. I love patronizing small, single location, mom and pop businesses. That is what keeps our city going.",

She didn't get her meal until we where boxing up our left overs and before she even got her food the owner of the restaurant put our bill on the table. I then asked the waitress if she can do something about her meal so she went to the owner and the owner offered 10% off her meal alone lol our bill was $93 and the meal was 16.99 so she offered to take $1.69 off the whole bill or she can take the food back lol I advised I wasn't paying for the meal so she took it back to the kitchen then came to our table and started arguing in front of the customers about how she would've just took the discount and she can't give food for free. It should've been a compensation for the mess up. I'm almost sure the pork chops they tried to bring out first that the waitress accidentally rang in was given to the table next to us. We will never go back",

I initially was going to take out, then decided to dine in. I came in for lunch and they were busy. They only have about 8 four seat tables, but they utilize them all. I can see this place having a serious crowd on wknds and especially after church on Sundays. Their call-ins were jumping too. I wanted fish & chicken so the waitress suggested to do the fish lunch for $10.99, it comes w/2 sides and add the 2 fried thighs I wanted. Which is what I did.   A cornbread muffin came out 1st w/butter. Then my lunch came 10mins later. PIPING HOT!!!! I ate the fish 1st. TO DIE FOR!!! This was some seriously tasty fresh catfish filets. No swai crap served here! Greens weren't out of a can, I did add hot sauce they were a little bland. Then I tasted my chicken, it was good, but not fried hard enough because the meat was still a little rubbery, but had it not been for that they'd have gotten 5*s. Chicken was fresh & hot, good seasoning no salt needed, just wasnt fried long enough. Finally I tasted my yams. Yummy!!! Just the right sweetness to them. This was a solid lunch for 10.99, even though I added on the chicken being greedy!   Let's talk about the service. This 1 young lady ran the joint almost alone. She never folded under the pressure either. Phones jumping, waiting area filled. She served us hunni! I can appreciate her. She did it all with a pleasant tone and a smile. I will be back!",

Most of the ladies are very nice, polite, smile, and actually acknowledge you, but not all of them. Order to go over the phone and you're lucky if your order comes out right. I suggest ordering there.  Your food is made at order so yes it will take 45-1hr for your food, dine-in a good 30mins.  I highly suggest the Oxtails and smothered chicken with beef gravy not chicken gravy, and you cannot miss their fried cabbage .   Thank you EllaEm's!!

The staff in the past gave a southern hospitality feel, which is no longer the experience. The staff yesterday just seemed confused and frustrated with each other.  From the time we sat down until we received our food was nearly a hour. My cousin ordered catfish which was brought out with the wrong sides so instead of changing the sides we watched the server take the plate to another table. After another 10 minutes we asked about her food and the server said they ran out of fish and they were going to the store to get more fish and acted like it was okay for us to wait. I could go on and about our negative experience. Something has changed about this place cause everything has went down hill from the service to the food.",

When I received the bill, the full price of my order was on the check. I inquired about this and the waitress stated that they don't offer any service recovery. No discount, no free dessert, nothing but an I'm sorry. She stated that the manager was not there and that she would unlikely offer anything to make up for the mistake.

    "text": "Experience:  This was bookmarked in my YELP and I was in the area. I convinced my friend to stop in and get Togo.   Facility:  It's a small spot located inside of a strip mall. There were about 10 tables and chairs in the room, and a small ordering counter in the back.   Service:  The young gal at the counter was super friendly and helpful. She helped me make my selections and even brought me my cornbread to the table while I was waiting, so I could take some medication.   I believe it was the owner was at the counter too while I was ordering and she didn't really look my way or act friendly. She seemed like the type that is just so focused on getting the work done, she forgets to stop and smile at the customers. That's fine, as long as she is not rude, and the food is good, I'm not mad at her. LOL!   Food:  The problem with soul food or southern or BBQ joints, is I want to taste every side dish. So I ordered a bunch. LOL!  I got the fried chicken plate with Mac and cheese, greens, fried cabbage, French fries, and red beans. Greedy, huh?? Normally I would order the potato salad, but they let me taste a sample, and it was really sweet and had a distinct flavor I can't place, but is not my style. I like plain old, mayo/mustard/relish/eggs type potato salad. I call it southern style, but not sure the exact name.  The cornbread (4/5) was good, with just a bit of sweetness, which I like.  We ate the French fries (4/5) while we waited for the rest of the food. They were fresh, hot and pretty good.  The chicken 3.5/5 was cooked well, but a tad too salty.  The fried cabbage was my favorite 4/5, but the Mac and cheese 3/5, greens 3/5 and red beans 3/5 were just ok.  A tad bland.  Is it bad to say I like my fried chicken, corn bread, Mac and cheese, and fried cabbage better?!  O.o  Overall: it was good, but M&Ms is closer, so I would probably just go there.  If you're in the neighborhood, you should check it out though.",

We came during regular hours and for each person the food was about $15 for 3 sides and a entre. I had the catfish, yams, Mac N cheese, and fried okra very good but also had their peach cobbler and that failed miserably. The breading didn't taste good at all, the texture was gross and bland.",

We changed for mashed potatoes and those were horrible as well. We were highly disappointed because we paid $25 for crap! The prices are ridiculous! Also they offer at lunch special that is $10.99...is that really a special? It's very far from the strip as well. 21 mins to be exact. M&M bakery is way better. We went there the night before and the food was stellar! If I were you don't waste your time on this place. Waste of money!",

The chicken was good, crispy and juicy with a very tasty waffle!  Not my favorite chicken in town, but it was done well, and the waffle was great!  Eva had the Fried Pork Chops (Lunch Special). Comes with two sides...we chose Black Eyed Peas and Collard Greens. The pork chops were pretty much PERFECT! Very thin, crispy and tender...so good!  Doesn't get much better than this guys!  On a side note, the Cornbread here is DELICIOUS!  It comes out piping hot with just the right amount of moisture inside....like a great cake.  It doesn't even need BUTTER!    And to finish, we were recommended the Peach Cobbler. This was good as well. I liked the crust/breading here...they make this fresh in-house.  Recommended!",

Uncommon for me to say this, because I have yet to taste decent store bought/restaurant potato salad.  I will say stay away from the cobbler. Awful!   The inside is really clean and fun.

    "text": "This had been maybe my 5th time to EllaEm's thanks to Groupon. I had always had a pleasant experience until last nite. NEVER go at night. The service was HORRIBLE. My friends and i walked in, you couldnt miss us, 3 adults with 4 kids. We sat ourselves down and no one acknowledged us. There were only 3 other guests sitting at tables so it wasnt busy at all. So we sat, and sat, until i got a little anxious and finally one waitress walks over past my table didnt look at me and go to my friends table and pass her one menu...I was thinking didnt that silly girl see all of us walk in and why would she only give her one menu then turn around and walk away. I wondered were me and my kids invisible?? Well finally another waitress came over Heather to take my order and all. Tonight my review of the place is mostly of the service because that determines whether i want to spend my time and money at a place where the employees are so very rude. My friends and i had sat at two different tables next to each other since it was 8 of us. Their waitress (the rude one) had taken their drink request and all before mine did, however my waitress brought out my drinks and cornbread before theirs did and when she did i watched as she kinda slammed it on the table WTH? Another couple came into the door an ederly couple and she was right on them as soon as they hit the door with their menus and giving them their drinks and they had not been in the door 5 full minutes. I know we counted. SO this really mad my friends mad. I can say this the other few times i have come to EllaEms it was during the day time so maybe the day shift is friendlier, Ramon is the waiter usually there that i see and he has always given me and my friends good service. BUT last night LaRonda the rudest swinging her hair waitress has left a bad taste in my mouth. And after reading more reviews i see other people complaints about the very slow service. I would like to give them another try but i am not too sure about that. And to hear they are microwaving the food YUK i can do that at home. THAT really makes me think twice!!!",

The place is only about 5 minutes from my house so you would think once I arrive the food would be ready right? Ummmm no!! The person I normally deal with is not there. There is a guy that looks like they hired him directly off the street working at the register. I paid for my food and was told that one of the meals was just getting prepared, smh. I run next door to grab some items and come back and my food has been given to someone else. I am LIVID! The food is great but the customer service SUCKS! I'm just leaving after being there since 8pm! RIDICULOUS!! Until they get better customer service stay far away from this establishment!!! What restaurant do you know that doesn't have a manager on site? They have to call him on the phone and he sounds like he is 6th grade educated!!! I'm sooooo done right now!!",

I had the baked smothered chicken with actual chicken gravy! How any times do you go somewhere where you are not sure what kind of gravy it is? Not here! I had chicken gravy on my chicken and my husband had beef gravy on his meatloaf! The potatoes were homemade with cream. The yams were wondrrful! And the service was fabulous! The young lady waiting the tables could not have been nicer and swifter! She made me tired just watching her! We really enjoyed everything about our dining experience! A nice welcoming place to visit and enjoy!",

A main dish and 3 sides, I got fried pork chops, greens, mac & cheese and red beans and rice. We had 6 people all together and the food came out quick. I was quite surprised that our food was out already. Everything I had was good. All my sides were good. Oh, yeah and they give you cornbread too. The cornbread was tasty too. I can't even say which side was my favorite, but I will say that the red beans and rice and greens were pretty damn tasty. Our server was friendly and our glasses were never empty.   One thing I will say, is that their desserts, not all since I didn't try them all, but the Red Velvet cake and Lemon cake are not the ones. I think it was a box cake with vanilla frosting, not even the cream cheese frosting for the Red Velvet. Both cakes were a lil on the dry side.   Overall, it was a good experience and I would so go again if I was out wandering in Vegas.",

We found out the owner is from the Bay Area so that explained a lot since were also from those parts. All I can say is keep up the good work and if anyone is looking for a soul food spot THIS IS IT!!!!",

    "text": "Soul food--yum!.  I bought a Groupon to this place after having read the Yelp reviews and there's a reason it's so highly rated.  I went with my teenage son and his father for dinner tonight, and when we arrived around 7:00pm, the place had only two other tables occupied.  It's a clean, nicely decorated, small place in a strip mall.  I ordered the oxtail stew and three sides: mac n cheese (eh, I've had better at TC's Rib Crib), mashed potatoes and gravy, and yams.  The latter two side dishes were done well and the oxtails themselves were fabulous!  I couldn't finish my food, so you definitely get your money's worth.  Each entree comes with the three sides, so that could also be why I was in a food coma afterwards.  Before our main dishes arrived, we were each served cornbread, which was heavenly--I wanted more, but didn't ask because I could have gotten full on that alone.  My son and his dad had the fried catfish and they rated it better than Hush Puppy's--the gold standard according to them.  I don't eat fish, but just looking at their food, I could tell it wasn't as greasy as the catfish I've seen at other places.    Service was great, the food is delicious, and the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is that I'm a stickler for good mac n cheese, and theirs was just okay.  So, if you're every hankering for some good Southern cooking, head over to EllaEm's for the kind of food that sticks to your ribs and leaves you feeling satisfied...the guilt sets in much later.",

We were vacationing in Vegas and, being the consummate Queen of Bargains, I had found a Groupon Now for EllaEms. After checking Yelp, I thought it was worth a chance.    My fellow Yelpers did not let me down.  Even though EllaEm's is in a strip  mall, we found it to be comfortable, welcoming and the food was great.  There is a sense of family and tradition.  I like that!  My man-folk had been disappointed that he hadn't had black eyed peas for New Years (not a tradition I was familiar with) so I was happy to tell him about the catfish and selection of sides.    It was out of the way for tourists like us but with GPS, we found our way.  The young man working was attentive and courteous. Between the fried chicken, meatloaf or ribs, I couldn't decide what I wanted. I asked his opinion and said that his fave was the chicken.   I went with the chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, mac and cheese and potato salad.  The man-folk ordered the catfish, black eyed peas, collard greens and veggies, I think.    Not only was he happy, but I loved my dinner. The chicken was the best I have ever had. The sides were all delicious too.  The cost (even if I didn't have a Groupon) was very reasonable and the sizes were generous.  Vegas is lucky to have EllaEms. I'm going to add them to my list things to do when I return.    Yum!!",

    "text": "Wow, what a pleasant surprise! Originally planned to go to Poke Express next door but totally forgot that they are closed on Wednesday so we decided to visit Ella Em for some soul food grub.   We were warmly greeted at the door by Victor who seated us right away. Entrees were a little bit on the high side ($9-15) yet still not too expensive considering you get 4 large sides including the corn bread. We also learned that lunch specials tend to run between $7-$9 and it comes with 2 sides. They also offer 10% military discount.  We ordered:  Pork chop - This reminds me of how we cook pork chop in the Philippines! Well seasoned and tasty. Rice & gravy - Basic rice here, nothing to write home about. The gravy was nice and and you get to choose between chicken and beef gravy. Both were delicious, but I prefer the beef gravy. I would probably skip this next time and order another side in the future. Collard greens - Not a big fan of collard greens in general but hubby said it was good (But he had better when he was in Mississippi). Fried cabbage - DELICIOUS! Sooo homey and definitely a big hit for both of us and we licked that bowl off for sure! We should have ordered more of these.  Fried chicken (2 pcs) - Juicy and crispy! I love fried chicken cooked this way, lightly battered and seasoned with Granny's special seasoning.  Mashed potatoes - Tastes like how we make it at home. Between my husband and I we could have skipped it but my daughter will probably not like that cause it's her staple. Yams - Soooo good. Sweet with a touch of cinammon! Corn bread - I love their corn bread but it was waaay too tiny. You can order more for 50 cent a piece. Wish they would make it thicker.  All the food that came out were freshly made and the service was friendly, we felt like we're eating home cooked meal on Thanksgiving. The kitchen is super busy with several to-go orders and it was barely 4pm, but we never felt neglected by our server. We will be back to try their catfish, oxtail, and peach cobbler. Was it authentic? I possess no authority whatsoever on southern-style cooking, but my soul was definitely tickled with such a positive dining experience.",

Portion size on the oxtails were small , I received 3 med sized pieces. Mash potatos  were solid . Yams were amazing , very flavorful. Some of the best yams ever ate. The mac n cheese on the other hand were very disappointing. No cheese flavor very, very bland. They also serve cornbread which was very good , a little sweet, how us yankee's like it as my mother in law would say. Overall pretty happy with the meal",

I had the catfish sandwich with fries. The catfish is amazing, succulent and spiced just right. (We went to a much more expensive Southern restaurant later in the week and I ordered the catfish which was dryed out!)  The sides including the fries were all wonderful. We will definitely go back later this year when we're in Vegas again.  We're dying for the catfish again and try some new items!  I highly recommend making the 20 minute drive to North Las Vegas to eat here and then hit one of the Station Casinos as well.",

No coffee or even water. After he was done with the prior customers, the young, cold, uncourteous server came to our table and said, \" Y'all want to place an order ?\". I ordered, he wrote nothing down, then he turned facing sideways toward my gf and said, \"You ?\". Just like that. Very rude. No manners, no courtesy at all. We left. Canceled the order.

When I thought about them this time they were just getting ready to close. So we ordered and took the food home. It was just ok, there was nothing exciting about the food. Everything could have used more flavor. I don't think it made that much difference that we took the food home.   We ordered the Catfish, Snapper and Meatloaf dinners(which came with three sides each.) All of them were dry and needed more flavor. The meatloaf, 1/2 inch thick with gravy, almost seemed like it was processed and had no juice, flavor, texture or color (like bell peppers, onions, tomato anything. The Snapper and Catfish were both fried and were very thinly cut.   They give you a nice amount of food for the cost. We had Mac & Cheese, Black Eye Peas, Fried Cabbage, Greens, and Yams. I loved the fried cabbage. The Yams were good, but could have used a tad more nutmeg. The meal came with cornbread muffins that were dry and boring.   The Black Eye Peas just tasted like Peas, and my 10 year old makes better Mac and Cheese. Not only could I not find the cheese but I could find any flavor. It was not the traditional Black Mac and Cheese that is baked with cheese. Greens were ok, nothing to discuss.   The worst part was the Peach Cobbler. I was excited when I saw the Peach Cobbler picture on the website, it looked delicious and flavorful. Instead of Peach Cobbler, I received two bowls of dough with maybe two peaches. I warmed it up for 45 secs like they suggested but that did not make any difference. It tasted like peach flavored bread, not like a cobbler at all.   The only thing that was good, was the service. They were friendly when I placed the order over the phone and when I picked it up.",

Chops themselves come with your choice of chicken or beef gravy, but the overall flavors were just okay. After craving this dish for a week and driving half an hour, it just didn't quite hit the spot, unfortunately.  Sides selected were mac, greens, and cabbage- I'm not even a fan of cabbage but their version was flipping delicious with bits of ham and good crunch without too much oil.  Too bad the other sides were so dismal- mac was a generous portion but super dry and the cheese was in large clumps as if my little sister were making it, while the greens were virtually flavorless aside from the heavy-handed dose of salt. Cornbread was decent, kept in a warmer that perhaps over-steamed it, as they had a mushy texture that I did not care for.  I was hoping to find an alternative to M&M, but unfortunately this place was more miss than hit for me.",

I woke up at 2 am craving these potatoes! Our other sides were just as tasty...fried cabbage, Mac n cheese, rice, and these beautifully sweet yams. I'd go back for the sides alone.   The meals also came with corn bread and we ordered a German choc cake and a sweet potato pie. These were also very good.   If you are looking for some heavy hitting southern food this is the place to go. The hot sauce was also very good and I'm glad I have extras to use here at home!!",

She was very unprofessional and mad at me as if it was my fault that my order was incorrect. She threw everything back in the back and gave me a free peach which was watery.

Jazzland, our waitress, had so much patience with everyone and has such a great personality which made it that much better. Timothy, our other waiter, made sure we had everything we needed while cleaning and tending to other tables with Jazzland. Their work ethic is very impressive and the food is to die for.

The staff mess up your food/order and istead  of apologizing and trying to fix it they play and insult you. I have never experienced being blamed for the restaurant mistakes until this place.   The food is a 50/50 toss on consistency. The Mac and cheese for a soul food restaurant is actually under sub-par. The chicken, greens, and cabbage can be different tasting from day to day.   I have placed orders 3 times each time my order has been forgotten to be placed. Ive been told to pick up in 30 mins. I get there and Im waiting for 1 hour 30mins and longer. The funny thing is you arent offered a refund, discount, drink, or nothing. Service and accountability go a long way with me. I once only ate here for Sunday's. Well time to find new places.

The portions were huge so I had some for dinner. Needless to say again after eating more of the food; I experienced the same feelings.

Sounds good right? Well, it didn't come with any of that. Just dry fish and a bun! We ordered to go, so we didn't realize it until we got home.   I've told so many people about how good this place was, and now I'm embarrassed that I told anyone. I really hope this was a fluke, because they use to be so good. $30 is too much to spend for food that isn't cooked right. I highly doubt we'll be going back.

I can say I will not be back. My baby had the wings and waffle which he barely ate (I tasted it and it also lacked seasoning). My guy had the oxtails and said the gravy had seasoning which helped the flavor so oxtails and rice with gravy may be the way to go if your interested in stopping by.

As for the food, the fried chicken was pretty good but the mac 'n' cheese was NOT. It was too dry & unseasoned. It tasted like cheese & noodles were thrown together without anything else. The yams weren't well flavored either - I only tasted cinnamon and nothing else. #NotGood   But them greens though!!!! The greens were the best thing on the plate - delicious!! Also, the portion sizes were quite healthy & the cornbread was good too. The service was nice as well.  Overall, everything was okay but I would definitely not go back. I'd go back to Gritz instead.",

They made sure that our drinks were full and checked up on us regularly.  They were also very accommodating considering that our 3 year old was knocked out and the husband had to carry her while he ate his meal.  I felt like they took an extra step to make sure we were happy and our needs were met.  Not only that, but they even gave each of us a to go cup of their lemonade, even though we only ordered one.  I thought that was pretty cool of them.  Now the only reason why I am giving them a 3 star rating is because I thought the food could have been better.  A lot of their dishes were on the salty side.  Like their collard greens, fried okra, and fried cabbage.  My mother in law thought the same thing which is unfortunate cause we were both excited to try their greens.  Not only that, but their chicken fried steak and shrimp were both hard, dry, and salty.  However, my son's grilled pork chops were pretty good.  They came out piping hot and juicy.  Oh and their muffins were delicious!  We kept asking for more muffins, they were that good.    All in all, the experience itself was not bad.  Like I said, the customer service that we received was great, but the food could have been better.",

This past Sunday we were planning on trying breakfast at the new \"Lumberjack's\" restaurant on Craig rd. but when we arrived there was a 30 minute wait and we decided to see if Ella Ems served breakfast. They do not really serve breakfast but the waiter recommend the chicken & waffles which you could order with or without 2 eggs. All 3 in our party ordered the chicken and waffles with eggs. Everything came out hot, and everything on the plate was delicious. The fried chicken was excellent, the waffle fresh and a good size, two eggs were cooked just how we ordered them.

I ordered the chicken (bland but fried good), fried cabbage (Ummmm so-so), and the macaroni (tasted like paper; wth)...Dont mean to be harsh but this food was not good.

If you haven't tried this little treasure of a place I highly suggest it, I'll try it again when I'm in a couple of months to make sure it wasn't just a fluke. And also to try something different on the menu, oh and to the person who felt they were forced to order a burger please the pleasure of going out to eat is getting what you want. Never let a cook or anyone persuade you other wise. Because after all you're paying the bill, so you could have easily left if they weren't fufilling your request for what you wanted. I patronize businesses that are there to please the customer, if that's not the purpose then why are they in business. Give them another try, and next time order what you want because I will.

Any basic recipie is better. Red beans  way to spicy hot (let customer decide  serve peppers/hot sauce on side)  oxtails  were either undercooked or reheated they were chewy and not served hot",

How could they serve that and let alone to a pregnant woman",

Each dinner comes with 3 sides. I noticed one family member did not eat the fried okra or the mixed veggies. the other family member skarfed her fried chicken. My snapper was fresh! and large!

I chose the rice with gravy and veggies.  I also got a side of the Mac N Cheese. The chicken had the best seasoning and was perfectly cooked. The Mac n cheese was awesome!  We also ordered their corn bread which were baked in a cup like a cupcake.  I felt like I lost alot of the bread with it getting stuck to the paper.  Otherwise,  really good.    The ambience is quite dark... But the service is great.  We got our food a little bit before closing and they were so welcome to let us dine in.    Great place for the soul food cravings",

Any who , I ordered my food and asked if they sell fish jus by the piece. They do, 8.00 for one piece. I'm already paying 25.00 for my meal, which they went up in prices. I'm saying all this to say. The food is over priced and some of the staff should take a course in customer service. Would not recommend unless you like paying for over priced food, that's not that great",

My friends and I were in Vegas for the weekend and decided to try something new and off the beaten path of the strip or downtown. Ran a yelp search and found EllaEm's. Being just shy of 10 off the strip wasn't too bad.   I'm sooooo glad we rolled through! Got there about 2pm on a Sunday, the place was pretty busy. We grabbed a seat and quickly greeted by our waiter Q. He got our drink order and gave us sometime to look over the menu.   I was torn by a few different items... Oxtail? Meatloaf? Fried Chicken? Fried Catfish?  Aaaaaah! I don't know! Q rolls back to take our order, my friends were ready... Fried Catfish & Fried Snapper with collard greens, mac&cheese and red beads&rice. I asked for a recommendation and Q was on point... Meatloaf with a red sauce is his favorite and Thad good enough for me! I got the mac&cheese, fried cabbage and the red beans&price!  All three of us loved our meals. The Fish was flavorful and flakey... The Meatloaf was tender, juicy and so tasty! The red sauce was peppery and the tomatoes were sweet! Great flavor with the beef! All the sides were amazing, but the Red Beans&Rice straight stole the show! We were thanking God we each ordered our own! There was no sharing at this table!  All I gotta say... I'll be back... Actually, we'll all be back! And I'll definitely open up to more soul food spots in L.A. Thank you EllaEm's and the staff!",

I'm giving 4-stars because I believe staffing could be improved. The staff/servers that  are there are outstanding, attentive, extremely courteous and they hustle almost to the point where they are out of breath when they reach your table. BUT...there needs to be more staff in high volume times to take phone orders as well as those dining in. I've been there four (4) times + each time staffing was the same. I've dined with 2 - 8 in our party + staffing has been the same. Tables aren't cleared/cleaned quickly.   Also, chairs could be more substantial for thick/plus size people. I'm a size 12/14, 5ft women and the chair is always uncomfortable. This takes away from my dining experience.   My group and I will continue to go as well as I will continue to refer friends but I'll also I'll warn friends about the situation. This may or may not be a deterrent.",

The food is amazing, they have the best soul food in Vegas and their portions are generous even on their lunch specials. My husband ordered the catfish, cabbage, and okra and his only complaint was there were no red pepper flakes in the cabbage. I got the pork chops Mac n cheese and yams. The food was cooked fresh, and seasoned just right! This is such a hidden gem and if you love soul food this is your spot! We have been 3 times and the food and service are consistent!",

We ordered everything; staples like savory ox tails, meat loaf, catfish and grits, macaroni and cheese, liver and onions, greens, fried shrimp, fried snapper and too sweet iced tea and too sweet red Kool-Aid like it used to be. It's Soul Food Sunday every day at this restaurant.  I love the history of the business on full display. The decor is also a cultural tribute in and of itself. The service was a little slow, but the entrees and beverage service were just right.   The cake we ordered was undesirable. The food here is too good to serve subpar cake like this. They really should have their cakes shipped in from the southeast or have someone from the southeast come in and get their cake game together. If their cake game were tighter along with a little faster service this would be a five+ star treat on any scale, but until then, please know that Las Vegas is lucky to have Ella'ems.",

Was hesitant when we arrived it was empty but we proceeded to order. I got the fried chicken dinner with mac n cheese, greens, and yams. The complimentary corn bread i had one that was tasty and one that was burned. The fried chicken was crispy and had a nice flavor. The sides had a weird taste as if they were reheated and reheated leftovers.  The greens had black dots on the leaves as if they were old before they were cooked. I politely asked for a to go box and didn't eat any of it. Tipped the waiter even though they weren't attentive and left....",

We got it to-go and I couldn't wait to dig in. Whoa. Talk about a total food orgasm. Now, to all my fellow Yelpers, I will say no more about this place; only because I was extremely impressed beyond words. Therefore I insist that when you visit Las Vegas, this place is a must! I can't really begin to describe how great the food was. It sucks that I live here in San Diego...especially now since I will be craving those collard greens from Las Vegas. Geez.",

Ellaem's disappointed me and now my wife and i have to still drive out to Cali just to get some good soul food. Ellaem's is neat and clean inside with friendly folks. But Ellaem's is very nest and clean with a large tv on the wall to watch while waiting for your food or while eatting. BUT Ellaem need to prep up on cooking there food better and that's soul food and not subjecting that a burger over soul food. Heck if i want a good burger i would have went to the Burger Bar. 1 star for this Ellaem's because I HAD BETTER.",

You will leave full, but you will not have enough for a doggie bag because the portions are smaller than normal.  I think it is because they are new.  On another note, you get three sides and a small piece of cornbread with your entree.  I was shocked that we got three sides.  My guess is that once EllaEm's turn a profit, the portions will increase which is understandable.  I must say that my liver and onions were the best I've ever eaten.  Everything was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s!  The service was outstanding as well.  I can see that they are really focusing on customer service.  In contrast to ALL of the other local soul food joints in Vegas, they have the cleanest/nicest dining room.  This place will get my business and my support because they are trying to do it right.",

You can get many of the dishes fried or grilled (I've had the catfish fried and the red snapper grilled -- both good.)  I have to agree with Mrs. P though, the liver and onions (with gravy of course) were really good.  Great find in North Las Vegas!  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "We decided to have dinner here on Friday night after reading some of the reviews.  My fiancee is from NC so his taste buds are hard to please when it comes to southern food. Upon entering there were 3 ladies (servers I assume, they were all wearing black) and one couple having dinner. The decor is nice and enjoyed the \"home-like\" feeling of the Granny pictures. They must have satellite radio and the best radio station ever, it was warm, inviting, and even a little romantic at times with the selection of music, soul, jazz and R&B. The server immediately came to our table and took our drink order. My Fiancee had the fried chicken dinner with greens, Mac n cheese and yams. I enjoyed the catfish with the same three sides except I had the mashed potatoes instead of yams. They were all very large portions, the food was nice and hot and yes, everyone is right, the corns bread is pretty yummy...................but can we talk about the catfish???? Even if you are not a fish lover, you should try this!!!! It is crispy on the outside, the breading or whatever they use is not to thick or overpowering, it's perfectly seasoned and crunchy, but wait, when you get to the fish.....OH MY! It is like butter; it melts in your mouth and is so delicious you would never even think it is fish. Definitely the best WE have ever had (yes I had to share, the meal was large) I am not from the south, but have visited NC and eaten catfish at many other places before and this is by far the best I have ever had. The server, ( I am sorry I do not remember her name) was also very helpful, when I explained this was our first time there and may need assistance suggesting dessert, was very pleasant and helpful. As they got busier, (many people were coming in to pick up to-go orders) and three more parties came in, we were constantly checked by the other servers, asking not only if we were ok but if there was anything else they can get for us. Overall, we were extremely happy and will definitely go back!",

When we got home and opened it up to eat it everything was wrong. One of ours was completely different from what he ordered and the other forgot his cobbler that he paid seperate for. I ordered the chicken and waffles and it didn't even have any chicken in it. We went back to get our orders fixed and came in to a waitress with an attitude who didnt feel the need to try to help out. After standing there for a second another customer in the store said his name was the same as my friends and come to find out the completely wrong order that went all the way back to our house and all of us ate because we were hungry in the first place they tried to give to him as if that was his fresh order. If we didn't say anything to him he would have taken it! After that we sat there for another 15 mins and when the food that she brought us out to replace sat behind her for a good five mins and she never brought it out. Not even any attempt to make up for their mistakes either with something for free our anything at all, just attitude. And apparently their manager \"doesn't work there.\" All in all none of our food was good and if it was it wasn't by the time we got to it because we had to wait so long. Got a floppy waffle and some mediocre chicken AND missed the first quarter of the Packers game. Don't waste your time with this place.",

Short and sweet...this is the purest and freshest soul I've had in a while and we just moved from the south. Firstly,  we were greeted by a really nice staff who had recommendations ready.  I went with the fried cat fish and chose mac n cheese, collard greens, black eyed peas, and an extra side of fried okra. The meal also came with corn bread muffins and they even gave me a couple extra for the kids and my hubby who had the leftovers. The muffins were moist and light in sweetness and density,  delicious and balanced. The fried fish and okra had a great batter and were cooked perfectly and didn't have an oily taste. The collards and beans were so fresh, not fatty, and tasted great; my kids loved them. My kids didn't go for the mac n cheese, but only because their taste buds are ruined by the boxed stuff. I will be back again.  There aren't many choices along Craig for those nights I don't feel like cooking and you can go easy on the wallet and waist line if you split the meal and get an extra side ir two or you can go grilled and stick to veggie options. The desserts looked great...maybe next time.",

We're definitely going back there when we come back to Vegas!!! Thank you Ellaem's for making our last night a memorable one!!",

    "text": "If you're in north town and craving some good ol' fashioned soul food, you definitely gotta try this place out! Their prices are good for the amount you get and the inside is very clean and welcoming, considering the poor location choice, which is in a plaza on Craig road and Revere -where stores are constantly closing and new businesses open left and right. If it is your first time and want something other than their really good fried chicken, YOU MUST TRY THE FRIED CATFISH! I don't know what they do to the catfish, but there is no fishy taste at all. (you know what I'm talking about) It's very clean tasting and the seasoning and batter is not overpowering, making this light crispy fish a must try. The sides totally compliment the food and leave me stuffed and satisfied. If you're thinking this is just your ordinary soul food joint think again, there's plenty of SOUL and HEART stirring up in this kitchen.",

    "text": "This was my first visit, fantastic service!  The food?  Eh.     Service was good, but a little TOO on you to place your order.  I literally just walked into the door and was taking off my jacket and the young man was on me asking if I was ready to place my order.  Not my drink order, but my food order (I asked), and it was like that for the first 15-20 minutes we were there, every 3-4 minutes we were being asked to place our order.  I could understand if they were busy, but there were only 2 other people in there. My friend and I just wanted to chat for a minute before ordering, but we both felt like they were getting irritated, so we ordered.  I got the red snapper (1/2 the filet grilled, 1/2  fried), with mac n cheese and fried cabbage.  Now first, their cornbread was VERY good (maybe make them a little bigger?), loved the cornbread, they were just a little small.  Not worth the $.50 to get another one.  The fried cabbage was also VERY delicious, still had some crunch to it after being cooked and very flavorful with plenty of juice served with it.  Unfortunately, I had to send back the mac n cheese.   It looked like it was a few days old and had absolutely NO creaminess or taste to it.  It was also oily and badly separated, and stirring it didn't help.  I really hated to, but I sent it back and got the mashed potatoes with brown gravy, which were very, very good.  Potatoes were smooth, soft, hot, and well seasoned, as was the gravy.  The snapper, both grilled and fried, was WAY overcooked and very, very, very dry.  The flavors were very good, a good combo of spices, but I couldn't realky enjoy it because I had to take a bite of one of my sides along with the fish so I could swallow. There was no other other way to eat it, it was THAT dry.   I didn't send it back, though, bc I felt really bad about sending back the mac n cheese.    I had a pleasant experience, it's a cute place where you can hold a conversation with someone without being drowned out by music.  They had GREAT music in the background, btw, classic R&B.    But-for the pressure to order as soon as I got in, the service was wonderful...I think I ticked our server off by returning stuff, but he was still polite, and the young lady was VERY nice, I don't think the smile left her face!! LOL.  I'll give it another try and will obviously order something else.  *  Absolutely no offense is intended, but let me make some mac n cheese for the Executive Chef to taste.  Again I don't mean to offend, but more than 1 customer complained about this side and I'd love to try....",

    "text": "5 stars! I love EllaEm's soul food! I have been here multiple times because of their chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles portion is pretty big. It comes with a big waffle and 3 chicken wiings/leg. It can feed the both of us. Sometimes we will just add a few sides and an extra waffle to make us extra full. I admire how they keep their food nice and fresh. Everything that we have tried is always so delicious. Their mac and cheese isn't too salty and has the right amount of seasoning and cheese. Their mash potatoes with brown gravy is delicious too. It always tastes fresh like they just whipped some up just for you and your plate of food. Their potato salad is yummy! It has that little bit of sweetness and tartness from the mustard, I would love to take some on a picnic. Ha! Their cornbread always comes out warm with a bunch of butter. My fiance loves their cornbread, I don't blame him. It has the crunchy outer texture and the inside is soft and warm. Yummm. Just thinking about their food is making my mouth water! I believe everything they make, they make with love which is why I gave them 5 stars. Prices are worth it too.   I love the inside of the restaurant too. They kept it nice and simple and kind of True to the type of food they make. Nothing is too fancy, you can comfortably eat and feel cozy. The walls have posters and they have pictures of their family members and I love it. The servers also remember who you are if you eat there twice within a week. Haha. I don't regret it. I absolutely love EllaEm's!  Oh! They also do trays of food which is nice... So maybe one Thanksgiving I won't make any food, but I'll order all my food from here!",

    "text": "The food in EllaEm's is excellent!!! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the service.  My family and I have bought food there many times we have ate in and ordered for pickup. Today 8/31/2018 we were trying to call in for a take out order. First it took about ten minutes to get thru and it wasn't a busy signal i got it was a message to leave a message. When I did get thru they put me on hold for another ten minutes. So after we ordered we were not to far away to get there to pick up the food then get home... now this was about 2:20p.m. While giving the lady my order she couldn't hear because of the music and was also talking to someone in the background. That was okay better to get the dinner order right.  When I arrived I stood at the counter waiting for someone to help me and was totally ignored. The ladies there just look at you, don't greet you and look like they wished I wasn't there and they weren't there either.  If the food wasn't good and I didn't feel like cooking and had already given my debit card I would have walked out. The other thing that just gets on my last good nerve is when you order your sides they don't know what they have available they have to check for instance dressing, cakes, cobbler, and etc. if this is a restaurant the order taker should be aware of what is available. If there is no communication from the kitchen it can be chaos for the front of the house. This place is like Gordon Ramsay's 24 hours to Hell and back, or his Hell's Kitchen.  My advice is if you want great soul food eat here. My advice is if you have time to waste and be ignored and get your mouth watering for a side you want only to be told \"let me check to see if that's available and then be told no we out\". Then for you my friend eat here!  I think next time I'll try ordering a dinner meal at 11:00 a.m. when everybody is fresh and in a good mood...",

Comes with 3 sides (a bit excessive, imo) and a cornbread muffin. Came out close to $20. I ordered macaroni and cheese, fries and red beans & rice as my sides. The catfish and fries were tasty. Macaroni was decent. Disappointed with the red beans & rice, probably would've been better had rice not been so dry/overcooked. I was satisfied overall. Willing to try more of the menu.

I ordered the smothered chicken with beef gravy with rice and gravy, collard greens and yams. My son ordered chicken fried steak with french fries, potato salad, macaroni and cheese. The birthday boy ordered fried chicken salad sandwich and french fries. My food came and it was baked chicken with my sides. It wasn't smothered in any type of sauce. I asked if i can have a side of gravy for my chicken. I wasn't impressed with my food. My son said his chicken sandwich was pretty good. My other son's food was tough meat with beef bland gravy on top. He didn't like his sides at all.",

How awesome was that! Lots of businesses take it back, I always wondered what they did with an uneaten plate. Do they throw it away? Serve it to someone else? Gross. I'm regressing.  I had their oven baked ribs. Deliciously baked! Lathered in bbq just the way me likey. Husband had the liver and onions. Of course the husband enjoyed his! Lol. He really loved their fried cabbage. Their mac n cheese was pretty yummy too, and I'm not a complete mac-n-cheese person. Their prices are pretty decent too. Soul food in other areas of this world charge soul food like catfish is a rare species, collard greens are grown from gold, and ribs are a season.   Anyway, awesome to have deliciously prepared comfort food nearby. Definitely recommend them. Service was great! Seeing family pics on the wall just feels nice. Reminds you they are deep with their roots. That's probably what makes them deelish. It's homely.",

    "text": "When you think of Soul Food, Catfish comes to mind. No, not the stupid reality show on tv but the real actual fish. Here they do have it with your choice of it fried or grilled. They also have Chicken n Waffles. I took my 12 year old son with me to check this place out. We did ended up getting the Catfish and the Chicken n Waffles.  The Chicken n Waffles were pretty good. You get 3 nice sized chicken wings, a waffle, and eggs any style you want. The chicken was crispy and slight breading to it. The waffle was just ok. I was expecting to be at least a little more crispy than it appeared. The eggs we got scrambled. Nothing special to note there.  The Grilled Cajun Catfish was good as well. Came with your choice of 3 sides. I picked Mashed Potatoes with Beef Gravy, Mac n Cheese, and Mixed Veggies. This is where I got really disappointed. The Catfish was decent but all the sides tasted a bit bland and was lukewarm. The veggies were definitely not fresh because it was partially soggy, it looked lifeless, and was chewy when I took a bite. The Mac n Cheese tasted like what I make my kids at home with the instant microwave stuff. It's not fancy but it is good enough for them. Here at a restaurant that is unacceptable. Last but not least, the Mashed Potatoes were a bit dry. Maybe they didn't put enough water or milk in the mix before putting it in the microwave?  As for service, they are a bit slow here. We came in at 6:45 pm on a Tuesday night. There were only two other tables occupied at the time. We got our food I would say about 15 minutes later. After about 5 minutes both our drinks were empty. Another 5 minutes later I had to ask for a refill on both our drinks. Rule of thumb, if you have to ask for refills after so much time has passed, that is not good service.   In closing, I would stick to ordering the Chicken n Waffles and Catfish. Stay away from the sides, well at least what I ordered. To be fair I cant assume everything was nuked. I also would like to try other items so I can give them the benefit of the doubt especially if it warrants updating this review. Until then, its 2 stars for me.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Cornbread Muffins Fried Chicken, Chicken Gravy, Fried Okra, Mac n' Cheese, Candied Yams Sweet Potato Pie Red Velvet Cake  Tucked away in a strip mall on West Craig Road in North Las Vegas, but frequented by locals and those within the proper city limits for what some consider to be the best Soulfood in The Valley, it was just after 5pm that I entered the stripped down confines of  EllaEm's for a bite before dinner and although several take-out orders unfortunately caused a rather lengthy delay from the kitchen one would be hard-pressed to name another place offering a more authentic experience, particularly at such a price.  Not at all billed to be the upscale experience of Yardbird and far less often discussed than either location of underwhelming M&M Soul Food Cafe found further South, it was at a four-top surrounded by a crowd of all ages and ethnicities that I was seated mere moments after entry and perusing the menu it a young Hispanic hostess offered smiling greetings before filling water and presenting the first of two rounds of complimentary cornbread muffins, each bite tinged with sweetness amidst a delicate yet toothsome base.  Offering a la carte options, but generally a far better deal when ordered as a combo or traditional \"Meat + 3,\" it was in rejecting temptation offered by fried pork chops as well as several other entrees that my original target of EllaEm's signature fried chicken was selected and although attempts to add-on a waffle were thwarted by poor kitchen timing the nearly thirty minute wait was rewarded by two legs and a thigh of crisply breaded brined bird, the spice profile well represented straight through the skin and into the flesh while sides of yams and fried okra were reference standard in execution, the man & cheese largely forgettable with overcooked noodles plus a soupy thin sauce.  Apologies offered by the young server for the missing waffle and delays that were in no way her fault, there was little doubt that a meal at any Southern eatery was likely to end without a sampling of dessert, and although the lack of banana pudding would seem to be a serious menu oversight both the small slice of warm red velvet cake and one of Sweet Potato pie were far better than one may have expected, the former far sweeter than other cocoa-laden iterations while the latter atop a crisp and flaky crust impressed by taking the traditional savory route.  ****No doubt one of \"Hidden Gems\" of North Las Vegas, an area oft lamented for a dearth of quality places to dine, EllaEm's offers not only a relative bargain for the dollar but also some of the city's very best fried chicken and Red Velvet Cake, no small praise considering the omnipresence of each on menus throughout town.",

Second those cornbreads were to die for, I have had a few in my time and they have been dry but these ones were soft and moist. The fried chicken was yummy, the way they season it makes it so delicious and juicy. Make sure that when you go eat there you go hungry because it's a lot of food and you probably end up taking some left overs home, not that that's a bad idea. We will be back for those Ribs and Oxtail dishes.",

    "text": "I said I was going to give EllaEm's 4 stars, but looking back, I don't know what they could have done better. I went here with the work gang for a semi-going away lunch before my maternity leave. Everybody recommended the fried catfish, and although I am not usually a huge fan of catfish (what's with that gritty-like texture), I caved to peer pressure and decided to try it. Great choice! The fish itself was light and flaky and the batter was delicious and a little spicy. So good. Also, the lunch special came with 3 (3!) fillets, so that was more than enough. The lunch special ($8 I think) also comes with 2 sides, of which I chose yams (delicious and sweet, just like I like), and mac & cheese (good, typical soul-food stuff). Others at the table ordered the greens, the fried cabbage, and the mixed veggies, and the only complaint I heard was about the mixed veggies. Oh and they also brought out delicious homemade corn muffins before the meal! The service was friendly and prompt and the iced teas (sweet & unsweet) were all delicious, too! Overall, this place was so good that I might consider venturing up to north town just to bring my husband here!  Note to management: can you please heat up your butter or serve it in a bowl soft or something? Trying to spread those hard packets on our corn muffins almost ruined them!",

I mean horrible. So much so, they should stop making it. ($7 for a large side......whaaaaaaaat!!!!!!) I didn't care for the potato salad. Had huge chunks of egg whites in it. Ew. Me no likey.  And, it was watery. How the hell is potato salad watery?? The corn bread muffin was embarrassing. How can you mess that up? This place is closer to 1 star, but the okra was pretty tasty.

The whole time I was there I was thinking that we shouldn't gotten our food to go.  However, that being said, it was the only downfall to this establishment.  But a SERIOUS downfall.    Service was hands down good.  The waitress was very friendly and checked up on us plenty but not too much.  We both ordered Fried Chicken white meat and it was tender and juicy.  Side dishes that I tried are: collard greens- fantastic.  red beans and rice- another great side.  fried okra- Good batter but after the small bowl of them i was oiled out.   I tried the mash potatoes and chicken gravy the Mrs. had and it was really good.  So was her potato salad and mac & cheese.    We will order here again but it will be TO GO due to the smell of the place.  That is the only reason I took one star off.",

The food on the other hand was very poor as far as quality of ingredients and you could tell the chef was amateur by the way the food tasted. Overall the food was weak! Wasn't satisfied at all. Pretty much myself and two others that I was with were very disappointed. This food def wasn't cooked with love.   I never wanted to write this review but I had to share that Thoughts and say \" How can you screw up smothered chicken?\"   They just need a better cook and someone to monitor the quality standard of the dishes before they are served.",

Location is not to bad either ... dining area is kinda small but inviting in a homely kinda way.... both times I encountered friendly counter staff ... that were patient thru my indecisiveness. .which is why the extra star on food and price alone I'd give a 3 but customer service goes a long way...",

We have ordered take out 3 times, all those times they forgot to put the cornbread in the bag! There cornbread is DELICIOUS!! If you've ever had it, you understand my frustration! No biggie tho, I should've learned my lesson after the first n started checking the bag,  now if we order to go, we check the bag before we leave.  The staff is always friendly.

It is set up more like a quick serve place but it has waitress service.  The service was friendly and homey.  They had some lunch specials for $8 or more.  The Fried chicken special was $8 for 2 pieces and 2 sides.  I had mac and cheese & greens... I almost ordered 2 sides of greens --- Iove greens.  The fried chicken was good.  Very lightly breaded, crispy skin and juicy on the inside.  The seasoning on the fried chicken was a little boring but the chicken was cooked just right.  I did experience an unpleasant bite when there seemed to be a nugget of salt all in one bite.  I guess that happens sometimes.  The mac and cheese was pretty good.  The greens were tender and full of flavor.  Soul food has a ton of salt in it, just in my opinion the salt could be toned down.  Of course, I wouldn't mess with a family recipe that has been passed down through the generations just because some Asian guy said something on Yelp.  While I was eating the chicken I looked at my fingers and they didn't have any grease on them.  I realized that the chicken was not greasy at all.  Just crispy & Juicy.  The $8 lunch special over all was excellent.  The portions were generous.  The food was way above average soul food.  I would prefer a real piece of cornbread instead of the little muffin they serve.  I will go back fo sho!",

    "text": "Tradition. That is what this cute soul food cafe is steeped in. The menu is a tribute to a lovely NOLA influenced granny, RIP, who lived to the ripe old age of 97 1/2 and who apparently was a gifted cook.  These are her recipes. Consider yourself honored to meet her through her granddaughter's perseverence to share her food.  Located on the north end of town, near Nellis AFB, this is a very attractive, clean, spacious eating establishment that should be taken seriously by locals and travellers as well. It is desireable not only for the food but for its location far from the craziness that is downtown and on the Strip. This is in the land of copius parking and chill attitude.  The Catfish has a lovely cornmeal crunch, not at all greasy. It comes with great tasting tartar sauce and your choice of 3 sides.  The servings were so big I felt I was looking at them thru a magnifying glass.  The braised oxtail came with 3 pcs as big as a fist and a choice of two sides. The meat was fall off the bone tender, and the pan gravy was plate lickable.  Even the cornbread muffin was unique with an interesting crusty muffin top. Served with REAL butter.  My mac n cheese side (oh my goodness wonderful) was made exactly as I crave, with lots of the right kind of cheddar cheese.  The collard greens were tender and hammy and tangy. Oh so good.  Then there was the fried cabbage with bacon.  I could eat that all day long.  And yep, Mr B indulged in tasty Black Eyed Peas.  I didn't, but if you want to see what all the hype is over chitterlings, you don't have to go down South. They have them here.  They offer excellent service and a delightfully cheerful vibe.  You have no idea what authentic soul food is about until you come here.  I have tried many places, but this ranks #1 for me.  I would definitely go out of my way to eat here again.",

Yams were nice & sweet, and the Mac & Cheese is worth doubling up on.  Finally, the cornbread muffin to top it off.  My son had the ribs and said they were the best--better than Famous Dave's, John's Roadkill, Friday's Jack Daniel's glazed.    Not too expensive, especially considering how much food you get.  Can't wait to return.",

The oxtail cooked to perfection, falling off the bone. The portions are huge. You don't leave hungry. Our waitress was phenomenal.

However there were a few people that walked in after us and was told there was a wait of 30 minutes while unfortunately we were not given that option.  Spoiled our outing celebrating my daughters 35th birthday and first time dad out after losing his wife  (my mother) May 25th after 58 yrs if marriage.  First time out with both daughters, 2 granddaughters, and 2 grandsons. Really tried to cheer my dad up but realized this was not the place to do so as not as much offered a glass of water although we spent over $300 on takeout! And lady that may have been in charge was rude to customers and staff at register while paying for food. Will be last time and will encourage others not to frequent establishments that don't realize customers are your business!!!",

Upon entering I noticed the place was filled to the rim with people so I thought this should be good. After standing at the counter for what seemed like forever and listening to the chaos was not good, even noticed the lady at the counter ignore a phone call saying she was too busy to answer it, anyway I asked for a lg peach cobbler and was told I don't think we have any so now I'm annoyed but luckily another lady knew where it was and so she hands me 3 regular size containers which I guess equals 1 large.  I get home and dig in and I go wtf. Half of it was hard and the other half was doughy as if they took 2 screwed up pans and made 1 big screwed up pan. Since I didn't try any regular food I won't say I wouldn't try again but definitely will NEVER get peach cobbler again and hopefully if I ever visit again it won't be so crowded as it seems like they don't have the staff to handle large crowds",

So I ventured off the strip and made the $20 Uber ride to the North side.  I ordered the smothered pork chop entree which comes with three sides and cornbread.  Already too much food but I kept my sides safe as I really am not too adventurous with my soul food.  Not everyone from the South has good food.  My sides were the yams, fried cabbage, and macaroni and cheese.  Nothing was awesome.  The yams were out of a can but they tasted as if they added nutmeg to give it their own special touch.  The fried cabbage was too salty for me to enjoy.  And the macaroni and cheese was just...wrong.   My pork chops were three of the hugest slabs that I have ever seen.  They were the best part of my plate.  However, it made me wish that I ordered my beef gravy on the side; as they also were too salty.  It didn't take me long to get full with the huge portions and I ended up giving my leftovers to the beggar outside.",

I called ahead to let them know that a party of 8 would arrive at 6pm because I'd done some recon and saw it was a small place. We arrived on time, we're seated and greeted on entry. Our waitress took our drink orders and returned promptly. Here's when it goes south. It took 53 MINUTES from the time we ordered for any food to come out. Then they served 4 of our party. The rest of us had to wait another 28 MINUTES for our orders. By the time they brought our food, everyone else (who were starving after waiting almost an hour to eat) were almost done.  I knew based on the reviews that this place was a diceroll. Unfortunately on such an important occasion I crapped out. I was mad because I was the one that suggested this place. The food was AIIGHT but not bomb. The best thing about my meal (I ordered fried chicken, greens, and potato salad) was the potato salad.  Disappointed in so many ways because I live right around the corner and this could've been my family's soul food spot, but we will not be coming back, ever.",

    "text": "I love finding little hidden family owned restaurants because you know they put their heart and soul onto every place... and they definitely heavily ladled on the soul! Now down to the food: -catfish filets: They were flaky and moist with the right amount of breading and crispiness on the outside. Not too oily, but still sinfully good -The country fried steak was just downright comfort on a plate. Very rich- I would recommend getting the chicken gravy over the brown gravy. I think the chicken gravy just goes better.  -Yams- amazing!! I would highly recommend this side. It's sweet almost like a sweet potato pie filling. I liked it because it almost served as a palate cleanser at the end of my meal & as dessert too!  I will definitely be back to try the other dishes that caught my eye: oxtail, fried chicken, more catfish mmm they will need a wheel barrel to roll me away",

They had a tendency to play with their hair and not once thought about washing or sanitizing their hands. I brought it to their attention. They weren't happy with me but oh well.  Then a change of Shift and the scenario was completely different.  First let me say Thank You Ramon. You made our stay fabulous. When Ramon was working he sanitized the silverware. Whenever he worked with someone's food he always had gloves on and was extremely pleasant. Whenever he handled money he always sanitized afterwards. I am impressed.  The restaurant is extremely clean, a good find no doubt.  The food brought back memories I cherish if being back in Greensboro North Carolina at my Aunt Sadie's home at dinner time.  Everything that came to us was flavorful and absolutely delicious. Catfish and fried chicken, crispy and not greasy, an awesome cook. Cabbage cooked with bacon wow, red beans and rice right out of the south.  Out of all the things that make me mad is the fact that I haven't found it before today.  Be Warned I will be back.",

With 3 little kids, that didn't go so well. There was only 1 waitress for the entire place. During the time we were waiting on our food, there were 2 different group of customers that walked out because of how slow everything was.  I ordered the oxtail, which was pretty tasty (a bit salty for my taste though). My husband ordered the fried fish, wasn't too bad and my oldest ordered the chicken and waffles, which I found disappointing as 3 or 4 chicken wings were given(I was expecting big chicken pieces for the price we paid), scrambled eggs and a stack of waffles. Everything was a bit pricey. If you're craving for soul food, I'd recommend this place; however, I don't think I'll be back again due to lack of good service and long wait.",

    "text": "I guess the thing that messes things up for ElllaEm's is that I grew up on soul food in L.A. and it's simply better than any I've had in LV....M & Ms, Roscoe's Chicken N Waffles, Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch, Harold & Belles...you hear me knockin'?  Went with the chicken  and waffles and they were ok.  The chicken needs more seasoning and there needs to be a few more pieces on the plate. The waffle needs to be pumped up some because they are a bit on the thin side and not too flavorful. I would recommend there be a host/ hostess  posted  at the entrance because when you walk in you don't know what to do. Do I wait  for a server or do I just pick my own seat?  Service needs to be faster as well, we waited far too long  for the amount of food we ordered.   Now, me and my out of town guests  were dead set on trying the peach cobbler but they said they ran out. I love cobbler so I tried again on Sunday and they ran out again. Still have not tried the cobbler.  I think EllaEm's excels at their sides. The yams are some of the best anywhere. The collard greens are excellent and the fried cabbage is pure perfection. However,  the mac n cheese was just ok.   Prices are reasonable  and parking is really good. There are several other good eateries within this shopping center as well. For first timers I recommend ordering the pork chops, collard greens, yams and the cobbler......if you can find it.",

I think I've found myself a new soul food hang out! My goal is to try everything on the menu, and eventually go back and make a few favorites! The place may be far away from my house, but it is definitely worth the trip! For that kind of food, and with that amazing service, you will be coming back for more! It'll feed your belly and your soul! Much love, EllaEm's staff! (Especially to Anisha!!!) Can't wait to go back!!!",

We were first in as the doors opened, it's a small place, all tables, the menu was your basic \"southern\" one with everything from smothered chicken, to oxtails and meatloaf.   I ordered the meatloaf and it came with three sides, I picked the mac n cheese, the collard greens and black eyed peas. The slice of meatloaf was about 1/2 inch thick but very small compared to most.   The sides were pretty good, the exception was the mac n cheese, it wasn't very thick cheesy, but runny and not much cheese flavor. Corn bread served with the meal was sweet cake kind, served warm. I liked the meal, but I grew up in the south, and we ate pretty good, the portions were large and filled up our plate, this plate was bare in places, so it made me think, they must be a little stingy with the servings.",

Between the four of us we ordered fried red snapper, oxtails, fried chicken, greens, yams, rice & gravy, potato salad, black eye peas and mac & cheese. The meal also came with corn muffins that were great for breakfast the next day :-) Everything was yummy!! We all left full, fat & satisfied.
