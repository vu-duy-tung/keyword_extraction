I had pho before in Portland and it's always the best cure for hangover.  The moment we stepped into the place, already we were soaked in the aroma of pho. Definitely smells like it's worth staying.  Our pho arrived and it smells awesome. The first bite was good but not as great as I thought it would be by the smell. The service was typical. Overall, it was just a good pho place.",

Its really hard to explain the texture but its more noodle like vs the chewy raw squid stuff in the menudo.  The shrimp rolls were big winners on the hot day too.",

If you had pho, they gave you a dish of basil leaves with bean sprouts. Wow, I've never seen basil leaves so large and so green. Same goes for how fresh the bean sprouts were.

My thing about trying places is a grabbing a pho and a rice plate. Solid actually. I liked my eggrolls in my rice plate particularly. Took a while to pick, their menu is pretty extensive and I appreciate that. More to explore each time..... Gotten bun also since the first time and it was also yum! I want to explore the non pho soups they offer.   I prefer the pho broth at Pho So 1, but not the ambiance (see review- smokey). I think this is my preferred spot so far. Solid pho, plates, and bun. Atmosphere is basic but clean (is it just me or I smelled moth balls coming in?)  and the service is pretty friendly, attentive enough but don't expect a lot of checking up on you- wave em down and they'll come. Oh and pay at the counter.   Coming back to t This is a spot I can take some of my friends who are slightly squeamish about hole in the walls...you know the type. Hahaha.",

But the last time I was here, it was a big disappointment.    We got here 15 minutes before closing.  Surprisingly we were not the last customers.  There were several people came in after us as late as 1 minute before closing.  However at the strike of 10:00pm, they promptly turn off the neon 'OPEN' sign.    I don't know if the timing had anything to do with my experience, but the broth of the PHO was so spicy and off that neither I nor my fiance was able to finish 1/2 of it.  I was just grossed out by it that I couldn't eat another bowl of PHO for a good 2 months anywhere!!!!    I blame Pho Saigon 8 for ruining my love for PHO because unlike before when I'd crave PHO every week, I hardly eat PHO anymore.  Giving it 3 stars is being kind.  I felt like my BFF had really let me down!",

I order my usual:  Small combination with no tripe and an order of the fresh spring rolls.  Great broth compared to other pho places because I couldn't taste the sink water taste I often taste in other pho places.  They have a good amount of meat and I am very satisfied with the amount of food.  Service was friendly and most of the time they don't write down your order and I wonder how they get it right most of the time.    They do accept major credit cards so it's NOT CASH ONLY.  Another reason why I like going there because they do accept credit/debit.",

We mentioned this to the management and they argued with us. At the table, the manager called my wife a liar. My god, the food was right in front of us. Hello???? 3. Pho Ga that I received had the plastic wrapping and parts of the strings in the PHO!! Yes, the cooks cooked the strings and plastic in the broth. And, I showed this to him.  We were so disgusted with this restaurant. No wonder alot of people told us to stay away. After this experience, we recommend the same..  Cons: Bad Service, menu cut corners, careful what you eat",

I was just happy that we were getting Pho and I think this was one of the places that pop up while we were trying to Yelp close by places for Vietnamese food. Everybody was hungover so we all got Pho. It's only 50 cents more for a large size I believe.   The next time that I was in Vegas, we went here again because we were lazy to look into other Vietnamese places and I got a different type of Pho which was fine, but service was lacking that day. I think they got kind of annoyed that we wanted to split checks, but the next couple days we got food here again which I will avoid coming back after his trip because I used the bathroom and there was a cockroach laying there dead which made me question if there's any in the kitchen.   Food is decent, you have a lot of your traditional Vietnamese dish here, even the Vietnamese coffee is made the traditional way with it dripping. But I would question the cleanliness of this place.

We came with a group of people. Two seconds after we sat down they asked Do you know what you want? Ummm, no not yet. Not more than a minute later two other servers asked us if we were ready... Ummm, could we have a little more time please?? Then when we were finally ready, we had to flag someone down. Not great customer service. They also put auto gratuity on our bill and didn't tell us so they ended up getting a double grat for not great service.  I won't be back.",

It was mid afternoon on a Saturday when we went there to eat lunch. We got the Beef BBQ meat with rice and the noodles with pork meat and meatballs. Everything so bad. The veggies were wilted, the BBQ meat was microwaved and taste like rubber and my pork meat was spoiled. They took back the pork meat & meatballs supposedly made me some new ones but they brought it out cold so I don't think it's fresh. The lemonade was not the same and tasted bad. I didn't even finish my food and took it home for my dogs. I felt like i wasted my money on something that was old left over from prior days. The veggies I know they pick it from left over from other people because they were all bits and pieces like they picked out the good pieces but still all wilted. There were hardly anyone there and now I know why. I'm not sure if they have new owners or they just remodeled the place but maybe they're try to get their money back by cutting back on the food by serving old stuff. Very disappointed and won't be coming back ever!!! Don't go there if you want fresh food. You will be serving left over veggies and meat.",

    "text": "I'm Asian...totally grew up with pho as a staple in the house...so....I know my pho!   ALL Asians on Yelp say that...but BELIEVE US! It's completely relevant and comparable to having an expert in PHO-logy giving you an expert opinion!!!   With that being said... I was pretty excited this morning when all of the family agreed to have pho today...but so disappointed that I wish we had just gone with the latter and went to a buffet instead...  So here is how this Pho-day went:  11:36am Arrive at Pho Saigon 8 Homeless looking man sitting just inside the restaurant door opens the door for us...weird...but ok.   We are seated immediately...good. *Restaurant decor...meh. *Restaurant size...kinda small. *Restaurant seating...elbow to elbow. *Restaurant ambience...bland...just like the soup.  We scanned the menu and hubs notices a taped piece of paper in the menu that says \"Consuming raw meat may cause illness\" or something along those lines...I see their reasoning for putting that I the menu...but that is hella hella discouraging and bothersome!   This female server (probably in her mid-late 20s) was the rudest B!7H ever...idk if she knew how to speak English or she was just having a bad FKing day...but REALLY?! If you don't like your job go work in some other industry! This is customer service slap your smile on and sell the damn restaurant!!!   She took our order for food...she seemed to speak decent English so I'm not gonna blame anything on that...but when my daughter, her friend and I have to say \"The number 3\" a dozen effing times and you still don't effing understand that it is NOT a #30 and THEN get a funky@$$ attitude about it after I held my fingers up so YOUUUU can understand. You better be glad my ghetto@$$ didn't come out for real! On top of that she NEVER asked if we wanted to order any drinks...my husband had to yell at her from across the restaurant as she scurried away to do idk what!   All of that threw me off so bad I kept saying under my breath, \"I don't want to be here I want to leave...I don't trust the food that is going to come out after all that.\" But hubs wanted to just eat and run because football was on. So we stayed...ugh.  Our food came out at a decent time...no need to wait. My daughter's friend ordered just the vegetarian spring rolls for herself she was still hungry after finishing that and asked to order the \"Vegetarian Pho\"  CLEARLY labeled...\"VEGETARIAN\" on the menu but the second server that waited on us (who was much more pleasant) stated that they use chicken for their vegetarian pho broth... CHICKEN BROTH.,.in their VEGETARIAN pho!!! That completely defeats the purpose of vegetarian dummies!...keep away non meat-eaters keep away!  Finally...my own food...so so so disappointed that even my PHOto was sad....the large bowl here is more like a small bowl at any other pho restaurant in town...maybe even smaller! Their satay is red chili paste...not True Satay at all. They use purple onions in their pho....kinda gross to me because it gives the broth a flowery sweeter kind of flavor...i like red onions but I feel pho has absolutely no place for them. I had no fish sauce, or salt in the immediate area to fix the broth...and trying to fix something that should be so simple to make in the kitchen bothers me bad!  I'm going to stick to my own home cooked pho or if I'm lazy go to Pho Kinh Do for now.... This place was such a huge disappointment!   I just read in one of the tips on yelp that they have a C grade?! Wtf?!? I wish I wish I wish I would have seen it for myself otherwise this review would have never happened!   1 STAR for making the 1st server go away and letting the second server tend to us....(She and the fact that Yelp doesn't allow me to give negative Stars are the reason why you got 1 star from me.)  Btw...we ran into that same homeless man again an hour later only this time he was standing in the entryway of SF Supermarket just down the street and later being pursued by an angry cell phone wielding Asian man....makes me wonder what he was doing at the restaurant if he wasn't a patron.  I miss Pho Ca Dao in San Diego!",

The things we usually get (pho with rare beef, charbroiled chicken vermicelli, and spring rolls) are great, but I want to try new things.  Some of the servers speak very little English, so asking for suggestions doesn't really work.   The last time we came in I ordered some kind of a tomato beef stew.  It was tasty, but the beef was soooo suuuuper fatty.   If I could get more out of the menu, I would give this place 4, or 5 stars.  Unfortunately, since it can be kind of a hit or miss experience for me, I can only give them 3.",

If you do know Street Fighter, than you'd know that I'm trying to say is that I think both restaurants are almost comparable to each other.  This is how I see how each breaks down - I order \"Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet\":  Pho So 1 -  PRO'S: . This is typically the place I normally go to when I'm hungover like I normally am in Vegas. Pho does a body good after drinks. . It's clean, it's nicer looking than most Pho restaurants, and it's usually packed...most often with some hotties. . They have an extensive menu . huge parking lot . Catch up on finding a real estate agent because they advertise in the menu. . Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants I've been too. CON'S: . Mediocre pho broth. Can sometimes taste like beef broth in a can. The 99.8% fat free kind. Come on! Fat is flavor! . Service?? . Get distracted by look'n at the menu cuz a bunch of real agents advertise in the menu.  Pho Saigon 8 PRO'S . Pho broth is slightly better than So #1 . Won numerous awards in several publications for best Pho/Vietnamese restaurant. . My friend \"Double D\" says this is her favorite place, and she's a local. . Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants. . The #8 is a goodluck number to Asians. Esp, Asians who gamble. CON'S . Smaller parking lot . The day we went they forgot about our drink order. . Older and less appealing interior . $7 freak'n dollars for a LARGE bowl which isn't any bigger than So #1's large bowl of Pho. In fact, I think it's slightly smaller. . My boba in my Thai Ice tea was like rubber pellets. . It's located further west on Spring Mountain than So #1  It's almost a toss up, but I'd have to give it up to Pho So #1 mainly because it's more convenient, and it's a slightly better value than #8 regardless of taste.",

With a murky broth, the pho is simply tasty! Add hoison sauce, sriracha, lime, and a ton of bean sprouts and you're pho bowl is set for success.   The service is good (OMG. People actually speak engrish here!), the place is clean (OMFG. I can drink the water?!), and the food is good! (AS IT SHOULD BE!) Pho Saigon 8 continues to impress me on my visits to Vegas and it's nice breather (away from the cigarette smoke) from the strip.  Although... parking is a BITCH! as it always is!",

They brought out a lot of lime as requested .. some Vietnamese restaurants are pretty stingy with lime most of the time.   They also have us a lot of Thai basil to put in our soup too.

Low and behold we noticed this Pho restaurant and decided to stop.   We are regular eaters of Pho, have been all over Vietnam and this restaurant did not disappoint. Service was quick and the food was outstanding. Unfortunately we only kept a rental car for our first 3 days in Las Vegas, otherwise we would have returned several more times as the food was that great.   On another note, do not confuse this with another restaurant called Pho Saigon that is in the same strip mall as In & Out Burger. We thought it was the same owners, but apparently not, as the other one was \"dead\" and this one was packed!",

Place was half full with mostly regulars and large families. Customer service is short and polite.  We were directed to a table (they are numbered). Utensils and sauces are on table. It is clean and so are the bathrooms.  Rice noodle soup with roasted pork and chicken with lime, mint, mung beans, and fresh chiles on the side. Pork was so tender and delicious. Broth was flavorful. Hubby had the large and he shared a small portion with me. Ribs with steamed rice, and a few pickled veggies. Tender and juicy meat on the ribs. They were sprinkled with sesame. I enjoyed them very much. I was also served a small portion of broth. It was wonderful  (lots of ginger).  Overall, I'd love to return and try a cold noodle dish with veggies and a fresh roll. There are about 50 choices and I would love to also try the coffee.",

Our waitress was a bit rude, and like other reviewers reported they did try to rush us out even though there were no parties waiting.  Food: pho with beef: broth was disappointing, it lacked any flavor. Meat was passable Fried chicken and rice: chicken was dry and the French rice was very wet French styled beef and rice: Beef was not tender and it was absurdly sweet. Chicken and egg roll with rice: egg rolls were okay, the chicken was dry, but the rice was fine.  Side note: the parking lot is normally full so be prepared to park on the street or in another lot.",

Growing up in Westminster Ca, I never knew how spoiled I was with so many authentic Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance. After moving to the East coast, I realized not all Vietnamese restaurants are the same. I have to say this place is on par with all the pho spots back home in Ca and is one of the best pho restaurants you can find in Vegas. I typically get the pho, but also recommend trying vermicelli, the rice dishes, and egg rolls. The decor isn't wonderful but this place is really just about the food. I usually get my order to go which will consist of a container of broth, and separate container with noodles, meat, and veggies. Just heat the broth and pour it in a bow with the noodles and meat. Presentation isn't the same as eating at the restaurant but the taste is the same. Overall, this is one of my favorite pho spots in Vegas and it's definitely worth a try.",

No option of a combo with tripe, tendon, meatballs, and rare beef on the menu.  Soup cooled down immediately when vehgies were added and did not wilt at all.

They are super crispy, crunchy, and always hot. An order comes with 4 and I believe it is $6. *There is pork in there, so for my friends who don't eat piggies.....  None for you! :P  Along with the eggrolls, I always get their veggie pho #29 with extra steamed bean sprouts!!!!! Oh and fresh coconut juice if I'm feeling extra hungry!

The vietnamese coffee went great with the noodles, and the fried egg rolls and meatball kabob were great appetizers. They also offer so many different types of pho it's CRAZY, so make sure to try lots! (especially number 18)  And I guess I might be stickler, but the customer service left a little to be desired.

    "text": "Greatly disappointed previously, but thought we'd give it another try...and still was unsatisfied. My wife and I enjoy visiting different restaurants on our days off and sadly, Pho Saigon 8 has continued to disappoint. Latest meal was an appetizer of Banh Xeo followed by Korean ribs for her and a small bowl of Pho Tai for myself. The Pho Tai arrived first, then her ribs...after we'd gotten about half way thru our meals (I figured the appetizer had been forgotten), the Banh Xeo was brought to the table.   The Korean ribs were not bad, but were nothing special. The ribs were served with rice and kimchee..the kimchee was kinda bland, almost sweet, not red pepper spicy as you'd expect.   My Pho was not so good...altho a small bowl, there was not enough broth in the bowl..which was probably a good thing as it tasted like dishwater.   The Banh Xeo...my past experiences in other Vietnamese restaurants had the shrimp, pork, bean sprouts and scallions included in the frying of the batter.  The Banh Xeo served at Pho Saigon 8 had the batter wrapped around the cold ingredients (the shrimp, bean sprouts and sliced pork) much like a burrito. Very disappointed as it was quite a mess trying to prepare and eat it. And the fish sauce certainly was weak as if it had been watered down.   We drank water and paid over $30 for this evening.   None of the people working there are Vietnamese anymore, I'd expect they are Chinese and just don't have the Vietnamese style that once made this a favorite place to eat. We were there at dinner time, 6pm, and it was pretty much empty.   If you want good Pho, go up the street to the 168 Market and find Pho Sing Sing in the shopping center. An excellent place to eat good Vietnamese food by a Vietnamese family!",

This is how EXCELLENT pho supposed to be:  1. Large bowl with enough noodles, & enough amount of meats.  2. Broth is correct!!!! Not diluted like the other bad pho restaurants I've tried & does not taste like Hu Tieu. The spicing is correct: I scent cowbone, star anise, and lots of ginger and roast onions in that broth; THAT'S HOW CORRECT PHO SUPPOSE TO TASTE LIKE.  3. Your server also ask us to include a separate small plate of onions soaked in vinegar, & a small bowl of liquid fat. THAT'S ALSO HOW CORRECT & TRADITIONAL VIETNAMESE PHO SUPPOSED TO BE!!!! EXCELLENT!!!!  4. Your Com Tam plate is also excellent. Almost to compete against Com Tam Thuan Kieu.  5. Cha Gio (egg rolls) also good; very crispy & well spiced.   But this is what I like most about your restaurant:  When my buddy orders Com Tam while I order Pho Dac Biet, technically, Com Tam served a bit slow. But here, the Com Tam is served to the table at the same time with the Pho Dac Biet. EXCELLENT GUYS!!!! THAT'S HOW IT SUPPOSED TO BE!!!! All foods should come out all at once!!!! Not like other bad pho restaurants where one person receive the pho, but the one who orders the Com Tam has to wait while their buddy is finishing their plate. Overall, good service.   So far, I have nothing bad to comment you.   I will be back to your restaurant someday when I'm in town. I'm hoping you keep it up with the good work like you did in my last visit.   Overall: 5/5 stars for you. Keep up the good work Pho Saigon 8 of Spring Mountain Rd.",

Hu tieu tom cua had very strong smell of seafood.",

Love that.   Everybody's hustling through the busy lunch and noone skips a beat. My only beef with the hustle and bustle today is the lack of napkins. Wow. Dont get me wtong, Im a fan of using my pants , but not even one when my food came. 2 servers said they bting some asap... Still waiting... Doesnt ruin my pho experience, this place is still the best in town. Mental note, Bring napkins next time.",

What I like about Pho Saigon 8 is that the broth alone can be drank as a soup, and that is why I am giving them 4/5 stars.  For me, it's all about the soup. When I took a sip of the broth, I absolutely fell in love with it. I did not need to add anything to it, it was not watered down, not too overly oily, not too salty. A definite perfect balance that makes you devour the bowl within minutes of being served.  While cost is a bit higher then usual $7-$8 a bowl (small), I absolutely think it's worth it to cure your hang over or just as a meal! As it stands, this is the spot to be now for pho after a hard night in Vegas.",

    "text": "Best pho I've ever had! I usually don't like pho because I think it's too bland and most people prepare them in a way that the broth and the meat really smell (I'm sensitive to beef smell especially, if it's not prepared carefully). Anyways, this place is good! I don't remember the name of the pho I got, but it was spicy and had \"special\" noodles that took them a while to prepare if they have to make a new batch. The pho had a subtle pork flavor broth, and the spicy paste adds the right amount of kick (not too hot where your tongue is in pain). And FYI to those people who love flavor, pho is not meant to be super flavorful like thai boat noodles and such. Think of it as your chicken noodle soup but Vietnamese style.   I also love the spring rolls, they actually had quality pork, and the egg rolls. The egg rolls came with all the veggies so you can wrap them in it! I've never had that before! It adds that needed veggie crunch to your egg roll.  And what amazes me the most is GOOD SERVICE! lol I'm very impressed! The waiters are polite and they don't give you the look like most Asian restaurant workers give you. Overall, good experience and I'm always down to go there when I'm in town.",

Anyways I just can't move past what I've experienced in this place. The service was mediocre we ordered two pho bo vien, avocado smoothies and spring egg rolls. I'm not writing this review to comment about the ambience of the place or the sodium levels of the food, I'm commenting about the nasty cockroach that I found crawling on our food!!! Yep, that's right a big brown cockroach! I would have snapped a picture but I was so disgusted and busy spitting out my food and the waitress took the food right away. We got up so fast... Eager to leave. The waitress kept apologizing but I just can't bring myself to say ' it's okay' because it's not! It simply is not OK to serve paying customers cockroach infested food needless to say I'm disappointed and disgusted, prolly scarred for life too!  Go get yourselves an exterminator!!!",

She ordered exactly what she would order in Reno but boy was she disappointed when she tried her order. I didn't really know what the difference was compared to what she was used to but I guess it was really that bad since after having only 3 spoonfuls, she gave up to the point that she decided she didn't want to finish her food. I felt embarrassed because on our way there, I was prepping her to look forward to some awesome pho but the only thing that she had was disappointment.",

My boyfriend had a terrible experience and swore off pho but I told him he just hadn't been to the right place. So one day we stop by and I tell him to try one of the combinations with meat since I know he isn't a fan of chicken. He was hooked. Whenever he wants a pho fix he always mentions this place so I feel like he's definitely in love with the dish now. That's not all they have here though. They have a wide variety of appetizers from vermicelli to skewers and spring rolls. They have a lot of iced teas as well which are delicious. The place is super clean and whenever I go the service is on point. Definitely a great place to go for a quick eat or to catch up with friends, while enjoying some delicious food.  I would recommend the following: #16 and #21 for the meat lovers in your life #29 for those who don't want meat (tofu) #61 and #66 for the chicken lovers of vermicelli noodles  Hope you love this place as much as I do!!!!  #vietnamesefood #pho #lasvegas #chinatown #restaurant",

The service is impecable and jaw dropping it's hard getting service like this now days. They bring u everything u wanted without asking !!!! They asked us if we needed to go boxes they brought all the perfect sizes and even tiny ones for the sauces !!! We didn't have to ask for one thing and we have kids. I've had many different plates and they were all delicious. They're incredibly clean here they clean from the chairs down to the condiment caps it's awsome. Would definitely recommend",

We thought we'd get pho tonight (1am) and looked for late night or 24 hour places. We found Pho Saigon 8 and saw that it didn't close until 5am - Great! We won't be those people that come in a half hour before closing!  We get there and they're hours say they close at 2. So we had to make a decision whether to stay or leave. We really wanted to give this place a shot so we walked in. The woman at the counter looked up and asked if we were with the only other table there. We said no and she goes, \"Oh....well we're closing early today...sorry...\" LOL first of all, sweet cheeks, you're dealing with two servers and let me tell you - we would never turn away a potential tip. So we turned right around and went to Viet Noodle Bar right down the street - which is AMAZING, also where we're about to tip 30%.  Idc where you have to be, you never close early.",

Bun Ga Nuong 7.45 Grilled chicken over vermicelli and vegetables  74. Bun Cha Ha Hoi 7.95 \"Ha Noi\" style grilled sliced pork & pork meatballs served with vermicelli and vegetables  54. Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong 7.45 Grilled chicken served with steamed rice & vegetables  47. Hu Tieu hay Mi Bo Kho - Small Noodles with beef stew (egg noodles)  The noodles were freezing, the chicken had no flavor and was really dry and the beef stew was so oily and salty that we couldn't get past the look or smell. It was the worst food and such a waste of money. We will not be going back.",

Thanks fellow yelpers, this is a great place!! I loved it!  We ordered the summer rolls, but I don't know why the server got confused with spring rolls... but anyway they were SO good!  Hers were SUPER fresh, mint, thai basil.  Also ordered Banx Xeo (crepe with shrimp, bean sprout and veggies i.e. carrot and turnip that has been seasoned ahead) this dish came with mint, thai basil, thai shiso (not sure if it's called like that but it does taste like japanese shiso!)  And of course the Pho was GREAT!! sweet broth, just perfect for a cold night!  It did strike me as interesting that there was no fish sauce on the table.. not that the broth needs it, but oh... well just an observation.  Many people were eating here for dinner, majority asians but some westerners as well.  The menu is HUGE, we did not get a chance to order dessert it was too much food, good food!!",

As others have stated, the broth is a bit on the salty side.  I don't mind salty, but it tends to overshadow some of the sweet component of the broth that makes pho unique and not just some generic noodle dish.  I ordered #18, dac biet - which includes rare beef, tripe, and tendon.  There was a really large chunk of tendon at the bottom of the bowl and that was my favorite part.  I also ordered a banh mi french baguette for one dollar which helped sop up some of the broth.  The place is clean, easy parking, and super fast service (pho arrived less than 2 minutes from order).  I'll be back for sure.",

Once seated it took a bit for a server to come over and take our drink orders, he was working hard and doing a good job.    Once the food came we were on our own.  The food was ok, nothing special that would make anyone in our party run back to this place especially since they have several locations.  Like I said after the food came you were on your own.  If you needed more drink or anything else you had to try hard to get someone's attention and if it's not the right person, hence a guy clearing tables, he has NO problem letting you know he does not do that and he will be gracious enough to NOT let anyone else know your table is in need of something.  So you are left to try and catch the attention of a friendly person who will either get you what you need or let your server know.    It is a busy place, most are friendly and try to help, the food is ok but overall and I guess it's hard when you are as busy as they were, keeping the place clean is a challenge.",

My appetite was ruined and I just wanted to leave. Without making too big a deal I showed the older waitress and she told me it was just an onion, then walked away and had someone else help us and rambled on and on in a different language. The only reason for the 2 stars is the nice girl who helped us after. Won't be coming back. Be better.",

Sometimes, the place you REALLY want to go to is closed, with no reason posted...so in those times, you go to your old standby.  Pho Saigon 8 is my standby.   I've always had good food here, although the service sometimes leaves a little to be desired, as was the case yesterday.  I went with my boyfriend, best friend, and girl friend, and we were seated right away.  When our server came by to take our order, my best friend said \"Can we please have someone wipe down the table?  Its VERY sticky.\" Server said \"oh ok.\" took our orders and walked away...and did not come back.  A runner came out with the veg for our pho, and my friend said to this one: \"Before you set those down, we had asked to have the table wiped down, as its very sticky.\"  She apologized, and asked our server for a rag...and was ignored.  So she went over and got one herself and took care of the table.    After that, we had no problems   The food quality was standard.  Not as good as the other place I wanted to go, but it definitely satisfied the weeks of cravings I had been having!    I'll gladly come back to Pho Saigon 8.  Its not my first choice anymore, but it will certainly do in an emergency.",

We arrived around 2:30pm on Monday 12/29/08. It was pretty crowded, but we were seated right away.  We ordered #1 Cha Gio - Vietnamese fried egg rolls $5.45; #11 Pho Tai - large bowl of noodle soup with rare eye round steak $7.50; and #54 Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong - grilled sliced pork, served with vegetables and steamed rice. The food came out right away and everything was really good. We wrapped the fried egg rolls with large lettuce leaves and dipped them in the sweet chili sauce; it was delicious! I added the jalapenos and hot sauce to my pho and it was yummy too! And the sliced pork was great too! We devoured everything! When we were done, we went to the cashier with our table number to pay. The food was great, but the prices were a little higher than most Vietnamese restaurants. Next time, I'd like to try the chicken pho, beef stew, and the Korean BBQ beef ribs.",

I always see 1 or 2 other staff members in there but they never help out. They just sit at a corner table and eat. Maybe I'm just going during their lunch breaks?!   That said, don't come in here thirsty because you'll never get a refill on water. And to top off the water issues it's always room temperature. You'd think ice cubes are a rare commodity at this joint!  But yes, still 4 stars because the pho (broth mostly) makes me happy in my pants!!!",

Twice in the past 2 weeks we've dined here, and twice we've gone home feeling some kind of indigestion - both of us, and both our kids.  It's weird to explain this, but we have to attribute it to what we had eaten there.  It is all too coincidental.  Any pho you select here is delicious, but something just isn't right anymore.  It has got to be the freshness or quality of the ingredients.  I had even tried their Bun Rieu, vermicelli noodle and crab soup, for the first time and left here feeling less than satisfied.  The crab meat just didn't taste fresh.  Lastly, according to the server, they've changed the way that they make their Da Chanh and Soda Chanh, fresh lemon drink and fresh lemon soda.  It tasted different this time around; even my son thought so, and you know kids' palates...you change a simple ingredient and they can taste the difference immediately.  They either put some weird syrup in it now or they use different lemons or limes...hard to say, but it had a strange, almost close to a lychee-flavored taste, to it.  Unfortunately, they forgot the key ingredient - \"freshness.\"  They should have stuck to their original way of making it.  It was very thirst-quenching then.  Bittersweet Adieu...",

I came during a very busy time for lunch, and saw a lot of Asian families here. This is a good sign. Like most Asian restaurant, there is very little to no service. Sit, order, eat, pay, out.   The pho is good here. The broth is good, but the noodle is lacking like all the other places in town. In terms of portion, this place doesn't serve as big of a portion than Pho 87. Pho Saigon 8 is a little more expensive than other places if you do a comparison of price to portions. However, it is tasty for what you get.  The other issue with this place was I felt full after eating the bowl of Pho, but 5 minutes later I was hungry. I do have a big appetite, but I just got the case of Chinese Fast Food Syndrome, which all points to MSG. For me personally, I could care less about MSG. I could even eat MSG ice cream wrapped in bacon. But, for those concern about MSG, I'm fairly certain this place uses MSG.  This is a decent pho place. Very tasty stuff. Is it the best pho place in Vegas? Nope. But it should be satisfactory for most people.",

I didn't get to try the pho here yet, but I did get the Bun Bi (Vermicelli Noodles with lemongrass beef and vegetables).  It's just as good as any other place.

    "text": "Everything's relative.  I've read some disappointing reviews on Pho Saigon 8 from some Californians here on Yelp.  You see, they come from environs where Asians are not a small minority, but a small majority.  Just by virtue of sheer statistics, I'd expect that the pho experiences they've had are \"better.\"  That said, I love pho.  I've been eating it for years.  I've lived in NoCal and SoCal, and in my opinion, Pho Saigon 8's a good joint.  As the best in Vegas, it may not better the best in Cali, but I still only go here whenever I crave pho since I live here in Vegas - and I have frequent cravings.  I've eaten pho from about half a dozen different spots in Vegas, and this is the best one out of all of them from a value and pho quality standpoint.  Pricing is pretty reasonable - not a killer deal, but a very good one relative to the other pho restaurants in the area.  There's a wide variety of different pho combinations (deriving from variety in the combinations of beef offered, from flank to tendon to beef balls to tripe).  One observer noted that the broth is quite salty and not oily - she is dead on.  I have a weakness for saltiness, so I don't mind it, but you'll be reaching for water after you finish your pho, especially if you delve into the broth.  Another small plus is that they are quite generous with the basil and sprouts add ons relative to other Vietnamese restaurants I've had pho at.  Also, since the restaurant is relatively new, the dining area seems relatively clean, if spartan.  Pho Saigon 8 always seems busy whenever I go, which is good from a food turnover standpoint.  The bathrooms aren't particularly nice...a bit skeevy...but could be much worse - by Asian restaurant standards, I'd say it's slightly above average.  The servers are generally workmanlike; not particularly friendly, but not rude either.  You may have to work to get their attention if you need something though, and they never check up on you after serving you your food like non-Asian restaurants.  The non-pho dishes I've eaten and seen eaten by friends have always been of comparable quality to the pho too.  The pho comes out quickly, and the restaurant can accommodate everyone from single diners to large groups.    I'd like to give this a 4.5 out of 5, but since you have to award a 4 or 5, I'm giving it a 5 because I eat here regularly as a fan of pho, it has very good value, and I believe it to be the best Vietnamese food in the area.  As a bonus, they don't have any annoying credit card minimums which seem to sneak up on you in some of the local Asian restaurants.",

    "text": "It has been long a while since I dine at this facility. This place looked different since my last visit. So they had recently renovated and it was much improved as I recalled. The place looked pleasantly clean and service was good and quick...perhaps because it was after 1:30pm and the place was practically empty.   I ordered a bowl of chicken soup with clear-rice-noodles (I think they called it glass noodles due to the transparency of the noodles). After dressing my bowl of soup with fresh herbs and bean sprouts, I dug in. First bite was ok. The shredded chicken breast was tuff and bland and the noodles were fine  as far as noodles go.  However, the second serving of the noodles were noticeably different in texture from my first several bites/chews. It was soft, tuff, stringy, chewy and it didn't feel right in my mouth. So I grabbed the clump with my fore finger and thump and removed it from my mouth. I looked at this clump of tangled noodles and it took me a few seconds to see that this clump of tangled noodles weren't all noodles but  a clump of tangled twine and noodles. WTH. I signaled and showed the waitress and she was very apologetic as she quickly removed the twine noodles and my bowl of soup.  She was going to let the manager know and also to bring me another bowl of soup as I had already lost my appetite and politely declined. I was still thinking about that weird sensation of gnawing on that prickly twine and that weirdness hadn't subsided from my thoughts. I ordered a portion of egg rolls instead and my wife and I finished our meal.  So I was going to let it go as my wife and I walked up to the register to pay for the other stuff (the crab meat soup and the egg-rolls).  The lady who rang up our bill and we paid. My twine noodles soup was not in the bill, rightly so. However, not a word of regret or apology from this lady as if she didn't give a damn. Thus, prompted this review.   I hope this review will help them to see how a mistake or a moment of carelessness could easily remedied with a simple sorry or a little bit of humility.",

My family and I walk in wait to be seated as usual and the server started to talk to us in Spanish thinking we are Mexican which is whatever we get that all the time we ended up seating ourselves and waited a couple mins for them to give us menus waters keep in mind no one greeted us I ordered the food I know a lot about Vietnamese food because I grew up with it waitress who is a usual waitress she always has her hair in a bun she has braces sometimes wears leggings that are see-through lmao she likes to act like I'm dumb when I order  but  also she's always rude and racist I can tell the way she acts with different people after they gave us our food they didn't come ask us if we needed any more water napkins etc. my daughters Boba was so mushy over cooked and nasty. totally sick of the discrimination and rudeness Only person that was nice was the guy waiter that had brought over my daughter her  Boba drink besides that will not be coming back here ever again.",

Instead of refunding/taking the extra orders off, they made us take the dishes and pay for it. On top of that, we ordered a vegetarian dish and it came out with CHICKEN it in. When we told them, the servers just stood there and basically said they couldn't do anything about it. We're from out of town and this was our go to place for vietnamese food, but after this we're never returning.",

They also served me a cup of soup which was delicious!!!  Cons: You're forced to be seated next to people you don't know and you're also forced to share the siracha/hoisin sauce with them. I would prefer that they separate the tables for some privacy. They're not that quick to fill up water. They ended up filling my drink towards the end but I would still like to have the water throughout my meal.   Overall great place to eat at!!",

Service 4/5   Food 5/5  Price 5/5  I came with some family visiting from out of town and they were able to accommodate a party of seven easily. We ordered pho with beef and variety meat bowls (6) of them, the grilled chicken with rice and 6 egg rolls. There was plenty of plates of toppings for the pho including bean sprout, limes and mint. The fish sauce for the chicken and the egg rolls was also tasty. I mixed up some hoisin sauce and Sriracha to dip the egg rolls in. The chicken was tender and seasoned well.  The bill came out and most dishes were about $10. Very reasonable for the price since all the bowls of pho were large.   Definitely one of my favorite pho restaurants in Las Vegas. Of course I will come back again.",

This flavoring was very authentic to those who cook Vietnamese food. My daughters ordered the traditional pho tai and they said that it was above average.  We also ordered the tri colored dessert and it was tasty.  There was nothing that stood out from the dessert other than it was good and we would get it again.  This place was definitely not disappointing and the price point on the menu was very reasonable.  The place is located about 5 mins away from the Chinatown plaza so getting there was an easy.",

It tastes amazing and you can't get it anywhere else.   When it comes to service, I think that they are fast and nice. I always get greeted and seated right away when I walk in and the food always comes out fast. One of the servers even gave me a free calendar since they give out free calendars around New Year's!

So how does one decide which one to go to??? Family, close friends, and the help of Yelp reviews are what I usually go off of.  So this little gem way off the strip.. and past I dunno how many other pho restuarants along the way.. was suggested to me by my family about a year ago and still remains to be one of my favorite pho places to go to while in Vegas.  What typically differentiates pho restuarants from each other is the combination quality and freshness of the ingredients, how everything is cooked.. but most of all, the broth.  There's no doubt that most people tend to add hoisin sauce, sriracha, lime, and various other condiments to cater to one's taste... but you certainly need a solid foundation to begin with... and the broth here is most definitely done very well.",

It's just a little farther drive down spring mountain rd.   I've had the pho, vermicelli, and the rice dishes here and everything is good! You can't fail with whatever you order, so don't worry! I always end up caving into ordering the fillet mignon (bo luc lac) with french rice because I just can't say no to garlic! They make it better than the restaurants in little saigon in california! If you're a garlic lover like myself, you'll love this dish because the beef is drenched in so much garlic, you'll have enough to eat it with the rice too!",

I did feel like there was a lot of meat, and I really liked that. There were a couple of complaints though: The eggrolls that we ordered was a little bit too greasy though, but the meat packed inside was decent. Also, compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in LA/SoCal, I kinda feel it was a bit pricey. Furthermore, the service with us was extremely lacking. A group of Vietnamese guys came in about 15 minutes after us, sat next to us, and ordered after us, and were finished with their meals before we even got our soups. Made us feel like if we were Vietnamese, we definitely would have received better service.",

The restaurant was spacious; clean and bright with modern decor. The staff was hilarious and super accommodating! My friends asked for things I've never heard of for their pho and the servers immediately brought out the requests and in large quantities; some sort of herb, the fat from the broth and onions soaked in oil.   My order of charbroiled chicken over rice vermicelli was so refreshing! Loads of noodles and chicken! Yum! Awesome lunch!",

My buddy in the car pointed out at Pho Saigon 8 as we were driving down spring mountain. What the hell, I said as always. Already tried 5 different spots and all came up short of being good Pho. Got seated and was brought these huge, color, and pictured menu. Right off the back I knew this place was a real authentic Vietnamese joint.   Went here 3 times in 2 day.enough said. Pho tai large : soup was very, very flavorful but the large there is our                            medium here.. And the bowl was $7. Wtf.. I know                           prices have gone up, but how does sink water increase                           prices?? And the onion oil helps inchance the flavor of                           Pho. Try it. #19 Beef Stew/ French bread : Soup was flavorful with nice size beef                                                          chunks.

Kim Long II- to bland Little saigon - large is nothing but water and soup was decent Pho Huong - Brutal , No flavor Pho Hung - Attention, your pho taste like crap. No flavor",

Admittedly, you don't come to Saigon 8 for its fantastic decor.  However, where the place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in a great meal for a steal! We started with their veggie spring rolls, which were perfect -- not too oily but just enough crunch -- and  accompanied by a fantastic brown sauce.  No sooner had we finished washing down the spring rolls with Soda Chanh (Fresh lime soda), servers were clearing away the appetizer plates to make room for the star of the show: steaming pho in a delicious broth, accompanied by the classic pho condiments (cut jalapeno peppers, bean sprouts and fresh Basil). In one word: yum.  And, when we found that the bill for 7 people came to just under $90 -- double yum! I heartily recommend this place!!",

The meat within the wonton tasted like it was previously frozen and it didn't have a great balance of meat and veg.

In any event, the key to good pho seems to be the broth (blinding flash of the obvious).  And whatever they do to their broth, it has a much richer flavor, much similar in the sense that the right broth makes miso soup or ramen excellent.  Even at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, this place is crowded, though we got a seat right away.  It has big tables for parties of 10 and it was being used as such, rather than a bunch of small parties.  The service was incredibly good for a bustling Asian restaurant and tolerant of our non-pho expertise.  As a note, instead of getting a bill at your table, when you pay up, just note your table number to the register.  Very efficient.  After being charged $12.99 for essentially a grand slam Denny's breakfast and $3.99 for a glass of juice at the casino, I was happy to pay $35 for 2 large bowls of pho, 1 small bowl of pho, 2 order of spring rolls and 2 hot teas.",

The soup wasn't that spicy but had an ok amount of flavor. Wish there was more flavor.   I like this place bc they have lots of noodle soups, not just the Pho. They have bun rieu - which I haven't had in a long time. I usually eat this at my grandma's house.   Its quite a drive from the strip. The prices are decent.",

    "text": "Pho Saigon 8 is my favorite Pho shop in town. I order the same thing every time I go so my review doesn't encompass the restaurant as a whole but for a solid experience please feel free to follow my lead.  Upon walking in you will typically be greeted with \"How many?\" After they are informed of the number in your party they will typically point across the room to your table. Service is routinely cold but efficient,everything is quick, if you are not clearly asian and you order pho' expect a condescending fork to be dropped at your table.  I usually order the spring rolls and a large pho tai which is rare beef. About 1/5 of the time you will get a bowl that is lukewarm or a bowl that has sat for 1min too long making your rare beef well done by the time it arrives at your table. Its just a necessary evil of dining here. The spring rolls are light and fresh tasting made up of shrimp, noodles, herbs and served with a hoisin sauce. The Pho Tai typically has a great salty broth perfected with some siracha, jalapenos, sprouts and lime. If you want a great filling $8 meal just order the pho and you should be good to go!",

I think that once u have have had a good experience at a resteraunt you're always expecting the same . Thats definitely not the case here. First experience the service was actually good  & the Pho was really good probably one of my favorites I've tried and I've been to quite a few vietnamese pho   restaurants . The pho was ok last night not even that good barely any meat or noodles .  I tried flagging the waitress several times even as she was passing by me she blatantly ignored me as i was trying to  order some spring rolls which came at the end as I was almost done with my bowl of pho because she took it to so long for me to place the order for them .

Maybe I'm just a bit pickier than most, or it could be that there was only one item on the menu I could eat and it turned out to be a greasy mess. Unfortunately it wasn't pho either since all of their pho is beef or chicken based.  It was probably my mistake for expecting to find vegetarian pho, which I've had in all the pho restaurants I've been in from Texas to California. I guess Nevada is the exception, despite the wide variety of vegetarian cuisine in Vietnam thanks to a large Buddhist population.  My review is probably only useful for those who are vegan/vegetarian. For all others you can probably safely ignore anything I have to say about the food here.",

I got really thirsty afterwards, and I got a headache! Ehh....I would have given it 5, but the taste just got to me afterwards...In addition, the service was just awful after our food came. Our drinks and food came right away, but when it was refill time....not a soul came by to visit! We even asked for refills when we did find someone, but we waited too long and decided to leave...

If you have a rental, venture up the strip and turn west on Spring Mountain (Circus Circus and Sahara, near Fashion Show Mall). Go about 2 blocks, and between Wynn Road and Decatur, you will find the asian shopping and restaurant district of LV. Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, you name it.!  Pho Saigon 8 is in this area. A large place seating up to 100 (25 tables of four). It must be run by the second generation, because it is clean, has quality decorative modern furniture, high ceilings, clean floors, computer POS terminals, and tasteful 18x24 art pieces of young Vietnamese women. Popular love songs, but no big screen DVD variety shows!  Their name implies they only serve Pho, but they serve a large array of typical Vietnamese dishes. Yes, Pho Bo (beef) and Pho Ga (chicken) ranging from $4.50 to $7.00; but also Hu Tieu and Mi (Pork or Seafood Soups with Rice or Egg Noodles $7.50),  Com Dia (Rice Plates $6.95 to $9.00), Bun (Vermicelli noodles including the popular  Bun Bo Hue, from $6.35 to $9.50) and deserts (3 types of Che) and drinks (i.e. Vietnamese coffee, coconut juice, plum soda, etc.)  The Pho was good, albeit the sprouts and basil were a little wilted. This is a pleasant atmosphere with pretty good food and acceptable service. Not sure what the 8 represents in Vietnamese. It might imply that the restaurant is run by Chinese, since 8 in that culture is good luck, and also refers to longevity, as in the popular myths of the 8 immortals.",

We picked the right spot and the drive from the Venetian wasn't far compared to driving from SF to Vegas.   Soup was very flavorful and thick which was awesome. Had beef chunks...a good amount of them in the bowl- not chewy or dry at all. The noodles were a little thinner than what I'm used to, but this is at a different area so I shouldn't fault that- chewy noodles and fresh. Also had a couple carrots in the bowl which was nice..it wasn't cook all the way through to where it was soggy and I thought it was just right.   I always ordered the beef strew with egg noodles in S.F at the usual spot I go to and thought it was pretty good, up until last weekend. Pho Saigon 8's beef stew was so good...I can't subject myself to anything lower.   Oh yeah....I went there a second time and ordered the same thing right before hitting the road and driving home. Again...it was awesome.",

Better yet, it was the old retired Vietnamese solider working behind the cash register making our iced coffee.  The Pho' and iced coffee helped significant to cure the hang over after a night of clubbing in Vegas.  However the attire and attitudes of the servers are the highlight of the restaurant.  The broth was very flavorful and we thoroughly enjoyed it after being buffetted out.  Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas and need a cure for my hangover from the night before.",

    "text": "How does one ever choose which Vietnamese restaurant to go to when they are everywhere and their names are only differentiated by a number?  Because someone else must bring you there first, and that brings me to Pho Saigon 8.  A packed place on Saturday afternoon, a bit of a wait for our party of 7.  It gets a bit crowded by the front because people are waiting to be seated while other people wait to pay.  (Note: You pay at the register after your meal, so don't wait around at your table for the check 'cuz you won't get it.  Just remember your table number when you get to the register, otherwise you'll be one of those dorks who has to walk back to the table just to find out what your table number was.)  I had a typical bowl of pho with everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Accompanied with it came the standard fresh bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, lemon, and jalapenos.  This place also provided some other leafy green to throw in, which is always a plus.  I don't mind the lemon, but sometimes I do like the lime in my soup though.    Like all typical pho places, all the tableware is on the table for you to help yourself with.  However, this place only provides a limited amount of napkins, not the whole napkin dispenser like some of my other favorite pho places.  I can be messy, and my nose is constantly dripping from all the sriracha sauce I use, so I like to have an endless supply of napkins available for my disposal.    Overall, a decent place.  Their menu is quite extensive, so you're bound to find something for everyone in here.  They even offer durian milkshakes, which is something you can't find or smell anywhere.  It gets crowded though, and to me, that's a good sign in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  Update: 04/23/07 - Went back and tried their Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($7.15), which is grilled chicken (or sliced pork) and egg rolls with steamed rice.  I replaced it with their French rice for a bit of variety.  I've been missing the five spice chicken rice plate from PPQ in San Francisco, so that's why I decided to try their version of chicken rice plate.  It was definitely disappointing!  No skin or much taste at all.  Service was blah, I had to ask for tea twice and it didn't show up until after my meal came.  By then, I didn't want my tea anymore.  I know not to try their chicken rice plate again.  Update! 10/10/07 - Brought some out of town guests for some pho and this was our safest bet for them.  I ordered 18. Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet (Small $6.35).  One friend really enjoyed the soup here.  He said it had a lot more flavor than some of the other pho joints he's been to, mostly in the South Bay.  We also ordered the 7. Banh Xeo ($7.50), also known as a Vietnamese pancake.  The crepe was lighter and crispier than the one I had at Pho Hung Restaurant, but it wasn't loaded as much.  It came with a mountain of greenery to eat with your crepe too.  You can't complain that they are being skimpy on the fresh veggie stuff, that's for sure!  The BF ordered 37. Banh Mi Bo Kho ($7.00), which is beef stew served with a small baguette of French bread.  He likes to get this a lot at Vietnamese restaurants.  Another friend was really impressed that they offered red rice too since she rarely sees that on the menu.  I'll up their rating from a 3 to a 3.5.  (I added pics of our eating in the business profile this time!)",

She hooked us up with hot water, instead of the cold variety and brought our food out in like 10 seconds flat! I ordered a #16, which was different cuts of beef with some soft tendon and nice noodles and broth. It was a yummy not too oily basic broth and the noodles were just the right texture. The meat didn't taste like leftover bits, which was nice and the price was just right! I think it was just under $9 which included tip! Highly recommend!!",

I've been to this place so many times since my family likes Vietnamese food and they have many other dishes besides pho, so it's not a bad option for a large party. If you order food to go over the phone then don't expect them to make it for you beforehand unless you come in and pay first, or at least that's always the case for me. The last time I was there to pick up some food they didn't have it ready for me so I ended up waiting, and when they're done they didn't even bother to bring it to me while I was sitting in the front wondering why it was taking so long. The crispy noodles were not that crispy and I was very disappointed considering it used to be very good. I have had many bad experiences with the customer service I don't think I will return any time soon. Some of the waiters are rather rude. But overall the food is alright, I've had better.",

    "text": "This is my favorite pho place in Vegas! I'm from Hawaii where I'd eat pho maybe once a week..... okay, fine. I'd eat pho at least twice a week. It was my favorite food for a couple of years and I was fixated on it. During that time, I tried a lot of different places and acquired a taste for what I like.  Pho is beautiful like that. While I believe there are objectively bad places, there is certainly no \"best\". It just depends on what you like, how your taste buds prefer things before it goes down.  Pho Saigon 8 is that perfect balance for me here in Vegas and I'll tell you why:  The broth! Amazing- perfectly balanced to me. Not too much anise, not too much cinnamon, not too dark, not too light, not too greasy, but just greasy enough to be comforting. I always order my meat on the side because when it comes in the broth is always gets overcooked. First I squeeze some lemon/lime on it, then into the bowl it goes piece by piece as I'm ready to eat it, but remember to add the rest of it before it gets too cold to cook it at least a little.  Ngo gai! But wait.. we'll get around to that.  Pho is a labor of love. My boyfriend thinks I'm crazy because I spend about 5 minutes after the steaming bowl arrives just customizing it. You have to find your ideal balance of sour (citrus), salty (fish sauce), spicy (sate, sriracha, chili paste, fresh jalapenos) and sweet (hoisin). Each of the elements are provided on the side and you add your own condiments.   There's the whole part with the beef, but then there's the sauce to dip the beef in. I mix a little hoisin with some sate which you have to ask for (it's refrigerated in back). Sate is chiles ground with shallots and shrimp in oil, slightly sweet but earthy and spicy. It is my favorite way to incorporate the spicy aspect into my bowl of pho. I add citrus as I go, to change the flavor a bit, starting with no citrus at all. I always request Ngo Gai (picture included) which is like a kicked up more floral cilantro. It's incredible, although not typically used in pho tai. Thai basil is a must with it's refreshingly licorice-y flavor, bean sprouts add crunch. There's even textural variation throughout your bowl that you can adjust!  I can't say I've ever had the self discipline to order anything other than the pho here.. I give into temptation every time. I'm a big fan of Vietnamese style beef stew and Bun Bo Hue, but I just can't not order the pho! One of these days.. I can, however, vouch for the spring rolls which are good and come with lots of mint. The bahn xeo is tasty and more than an entree size, even though it's on the appetizer list.  A unique offering at Pho Saigon 8 is the soda with egg yolk and condensed milk. I haven't seen this anywhere else in Vegas, and it's like a custard soda. Just the richness I want after a light bowl of pho. Absolutely delicious!",

I'm not sure if it's the broth, the noodles, the meat, the vegetables, or all of the above, but this place is DAMN GOOD!   The staff are always super friendly, and the restaurant itself has a good atmosphere, although I'm usually just taking it home. Not to mention the prices are great value for what you get!   Next time you're out with friends, or maybe a hot date, don't make a 'phoking' mistake and go to Pho Saigon 8!",

    "text": "While traveling around spring road near Las Vegas, I stumbled upon this pho vietnamese restaurant that was recommended to me from a local. He said this place was the best he tried and he went to most of the places on this road. Let me tell you, there are plenty of other choices for Vietnamese restaurants around. I definitely took his word for it because he's a crazy foodie who loves to eat.   Inside, it is ambient. The waiters and waitresses are Vietnamese and the service quality is excellent. The inside is decorated with Vietnamese culture and is clean. The pictures on the menu look better than the food themselves, but the fresh taste of ingredients is definitely there.    The food is very cheap, I would wager based on the pictures I've posted, everything is about 10$ ish and lower. The appetizer I ordered is the spring roll and it was immaculate.   The parking outside is full and hard to fill probably because this place is so good!!!! The outside is hot and surrounded by other small restaurants on a large open road.    If you are wondering if it is noisy inside, it is peaceful. The desserts here are very cheap, 3$ and below. The smell of the food is just mind blowing, and the service is about 10 minutes of waiting. The drinks come out fast, less than a minute and refills are also quick.   In the end, if you love Vietnamese food, this place is top of the line in quality, service and price. The meal I had was a tofu and vermicelli combo. The other ordered item was a grilled shrimp and vermicelli. The only Con is nothing. I highly recommend this place if you are hungry and want to give Vietnamese food a chance. One of the best Vietnamese food I have ever eaten. Cheers!",

I'm not sure what's changed but what's suppose to be a thick, red based soup turned out to be thin clear broth. When you order this noodle, the waitstaff always let you know that it's a thick soup. See pics of what it's supposed to look like and what I got.   Had to make sure I placed the right order and although the waitress confirmed it's the right order and she previously also told me that it comes with a thick soup, it was far from what I had ordered and let her know the soup is thin. Waitress response was oh they like to change it up every now and then! WTF? Do you change the pho soup every now and then too?    This #40 noodle soup has been consistent for years until now.   2 stars for the clean atmosphere and quick delivery of our order.   Sadly Pho Saigon 8, we must part ways.",

Usually we would head to Pho Kim Long but we thought of the busy parking lot and customers at that place. So Pho Saigon 8 it is. Less crowds and no hassles of finding parking so far.   Service is okay. Simply just bring what you want and your order and check up on you once. My husband and I ordered the same thing #14 pho noodle soup with round steak and tendon. It was good especially on a cold night. The beef broth soup was to my liking with enough flavor and not bland at all.   We will definitely be back. Price is reasonable and not as noisy.   Tip: on a cold night, dont sit near the entrance. The ins and outs of customer through the doors sends a wind chill your way. The soup warms you up but later it will dissapate towards the end of your meal.  Oh, i deducted a star. I believe the restaurant could use and updated look.   HAPPY EATS!!!",

We had a table of 10 people. 9 peoples orders came and one of those 9 even ordered an additional plate of food. We finished all of our food and within the time we were all eating, we asked if the last order was coming three times and they said it's coming. It never came and we were already almost done with the food. The server came and checked if we already got the order and ate it instead of checking if the kitchen fulfilled that order already. We were already done eating so she just ate our appetizers instead of an actual entree.   The bo luc lac, which is shaken beef was cooked medium rare and it was extremely chewy. The onions were raw and the rice that came with it was overlooked and hard, almost as if it was a few days old.   It's been two times where they fill the water on one half of the table and not the other half.  Service = 1star  Food = 3star",

The broth here is what makes it so good. I always get the pho tai gan (comes with the steak and soft tendons). Honestly, it's the only one I've tried. It's such a long time between trips out to Vegas, that I'm always craving the same thing. If you haven't had pho before, there is hoisin sauce and siracha or another chili sauce (siracha is the more spicy kind with the green top, the other kind is in the cup with the spoon. I'm a weak asian so I go for the less spicy kind :X) that I usually mix together in a small sauce dish and dip my noodles into it.  To drink, they have amazing coconut water. It's so sweet and refreshing. If you want to be healthy, order the kind from the fresh young coconut (not as sweet, but still very good). For any of you asian readers, the che 3 mau (three bean dessert with coconut milk) is so reminiscent of our childhood. I'm not really sure how it tastes to westerners, but the dessert is definitely top 5 on my dessert list.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.anitaeat.com&s=14efe95c768295c052c5ff4eddff6e4d46bf1ac720e22cab1ca53e8f3aec1c76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">anitaeat.com</a>",

The waiters are polite and courteous - they didn't get offended or gave me a blank stare when I asked for a fork.  The place is nicely decorated and crowded., but we didn't have to wait to get a table.  Awesome place to go to if you are in Vegas. It was only about 10min drive from the strip. I'd recommend this place if you really want a quality bowl of Pho in Vegas.",

It was so good that I ended up back a week later, only to discover that while it was still pretty good, their plastic drinking glasses and plastic soup spoons reek of bleach or some other cleansing agent. Nice to know they are sanitized, but I could live without the chemical infusion with my lunch.   Good soup, clean place, but a little too heavy on the cleansers.

Started off okay, as we promptly got our drink orders taken and had a chance to look over the menu. Looked like a nice extensive menu! The woman taking our food order was different from the man who took our drink order. I was slightly worried because she did not write anything down, and she later had to come back to clarify a part of our order. I also had to repeat my order to her 3x - but perhaps I wasn't speaking clearly enough.  Anyway, food arrived and I added in some jalapenos, basil, and chili sauce which enhanced the soup. However, the well done beef brisket pieces were extremely fatty. So much that I couldn't even eat them. The soup was okay, but not as good as what I get at Lemongrass Cafe.   Unfortunately after we received our food, no one came by to check on us and it was difficult to flag down someone to get a water refill. Granted, I don't usually have high expectations for service in Asian restaurants, but it sucks when you feel like you're being purposely ignored.  Not planning on ever coming back here. Not much positives to warrant it.",

I got the #18, and the soup was pretty darm good.  Not the best I've ever had, but probably one of the better ones I've had, especially in vegas.  It's a bit more beefy and less marrow-y/stinky, and doesn't have as much onion flavor as I would like, but it's still a pretty densely flavored soup.  One strange thing is that they didn't have any fish sauce at the table - we were going to ask for some, but ended up not needing it since the broth was pretty tasty (even though it was stink-less).  The summer rolls are so-so, and kind of on the pricey side, but they do have these really delicious chargrilled pork summer rolls that were REALLY good - they're pretty much pork sausages wrapped with scallion and a crispy egg roll shell with a really tasty satay dipping sauce.  Yum.  As a side note, they don't really give you too many vegetables, but if you ask for another place they'll give you one.  And the basil and bean sprouts were really really fresh, which is always a big plus.",

She then tells the guy we were following and he waves come this way again. And as she turned her head she whipped my fave with her ponytail! Wtf??? We sit down and get water. We ordered hot tea and we got our appetizer before the tea. The spring rolls were not only disgustingly gross and Not fresh but the shrimp were not even cleaned! Disgusting!!!!! We got our pho and I asked to order some eggrolls since the spring rolls were nasty! Needless to say I never got my eggrolls because they never put my order in. I ended up paying $30 for the most disgusting Vietnamese food I've ever had! And our table was dirty! Sticky and dirty! The place even felt dirty!  Do NOT go to this place, unless you like dirty shrimp, old wilted lettuce, horrible service and like dirty dining! This place should be on news for their Dirty Dining segment....

We used to live in Henderson and loved Pho Saigon 8, but now that we live on the other side of town we decided to try their Spring Mountain location.   The decor is identical to the Henderson location, but the food is not nearly as good. The dining area is huge and the wait staff were friendly and even played peek-a-boo with our little one. We ordered the egg rolls and we both decided on grilled pork vermicelli. The egg rolls were OK, but the vinegar sauce on the side was lacking in flavor. The vermicelli was a biggest disappointment of the night. The pork didn't have the usual rich grilled flavor and the vegetables looked wilted and old. I didn't touch the lettuce and scooted the limp carrots to the side of my bowl. The noodles seemed old and were cold and lifeless. The flavors were muddled, not the bright and vibrant dish I was hoping to receive. We also shared a thai tea which tasted off too. I took a couple of sips and decided I was done.

However, their pho is excellent! Especially during slow hours, their soup base is perfect! Not too salty, and they are really generous with the amount of noodles they give. I suggest getting a large for just 50 cents more. And ask for the meat on the side if you prefer your meat to be more tender and soft. The thin slices of meat cook really fast in the hot soup and gets really hard and overcooked eventually.",

    "text": "I went here for the first time yesterday with my family, and let me tell you Pho Saigon 8 has theeeeee BEST pho I've ever had in Las Vegas! Their pho broth is so tasty and it doesn't taste like water.. Unlike the other pho places I've been to. My brother isn't the biggest pho fan in the world, so he had their Korean BBQ plate & my daughter had their grilled chicken plate. Both came with a generous amount of rice, vegetables, & their nuoc cham sauce. I tried both and they were both sooo delicious! If I could order Pho, Korean BBQ, and Grilled Chicken.. I so would do it!   Anyway, the place is nice & clean. It didn't take very long for us to get seated by the servers. The only reason why I didn't give this place five stars is because their service isn't all that great. I really appreciate servers who smile and are attentive, but you won't find that here :( I guess you can't pair up great food with great service.  Despite the whole crappy service thing, their food is on point so you'll definitely find me coming back here for more in the future :)",

This pho restaurant is a bit far but worth the drive. It is a big place so no need to wait for a table. Very clean and many severs for quick service. The soup broth is very good, not full of msg. It does not make you thirsty for days after consumption.  I get the small Pho and it is more than enough for me. I have never finished a bowl of pho before.   Egg rolls are also good. Crispy hot and meaty filling with lots of lettuce and mint for wrapping. My favorite!  Potent Vietnamese ice coffee will revive you for another night of debauchery.",

When I first moved the Vegas 8 years ago, I picked Pho So 1 as the best place to eat pho, but that place really went down hill about two years ago when they changed cooks. PS8 wasn't on the top of my list back then because they were very inconsistent with their food.  About a year ago, I noticed the food at PS8 got better and stayed consistently good. If you read my reviews before, you know that I always seek out and try new Viet restaurants as soon as they opened, but nothing came close or beat PS8 so far.  Beside Pho, I highly recommend the pork chop rice dish and the grilled pork vermicelli noodle. Their soda lemonade (viet style) is the best in town. They also accept all types of credit cards.  One more thing that I'm very impressed is the fact they haven't been on dirty diners list since I moved to Vegas and that is quite an accomplishment for an Asian restaurant. (LOL)",

The service has never been good and I didn't think it could get worse, but it has! The table next to me ordered after I did, we ordered the same thing but they got their food before my dad. My dad finally got his food 15 minutes after the table next to us.   Then I ordered the vermicelli, which came out quick, but I had to sit for 20 minutes until my dad got his food. Then when I actually started eating I noticed most of my lettuce was spoiled! It was turning brown and gray! So disgusting. The only thing I was asked when I brought this to someone's attention was if I wanted new lettuce! Was I really supposed to pick out all of the bad lettuce an eat everything else around it? An then I was still charged for my meal!   Avoid this place! Go to Pho So 1 down the street. Much better!",

It was over five months ago so I'm trying my best to recall the details of my visit.. Service was typical of a pho restaurant. We only saw the waitress when we ordered and when the food came. I remember the broth and meat being decent.  My issue with this place was the price and the waitress when I was placing my order. I believe it was $8-$9 for a large bowl (but their large was equivalent to a small/medium on OC!). I asked her if they had 'pho tuoi' which translates to fresh pho noodles (it's slightly thicker than the one they usually use). I had to explain to her that it's thicker noodles and she claimed that they do offer pho tuoi. When my bowl arrived, it was pretty obvious that they just gave me the thick white hu tieu noodles! Ugh, it already took forever to receive our food so I didn't even bother to send it back. I'm definitely never coming back here again. I should have known better than to expect good pho in Las Vegas.",

Easy access and parking.  Staff are friendly enough, but the food is what I come for. Egg rolls are hands down some of the tastiest I have ever had and the Pho is always hot and fresh. The portions are plentiful but you don't walk away feeling overly full. I really enjoy having mine with chicken, bean sprouts, a lil mint, lime and hoisin sauce. Sometimes I use Sriracha to kick up the heat.   They are many choices of where to have Pho in our city but this is definitely my favorite place.",

If you're debating between Pho Kim Long and Pho Saigon 8, come here no question.   Despite what I said in my last review about the service being lacking, you need to consider where you are and what the restaurant deems to be important.   This place is always insanely busy. Your order will be taken very promptly and the food will come out within 10 minutes. That is what their staff emphasize in order to consistently serve and please the masses.",

My all time favorite thing here is there spring rolls with peanut sauce. Just the perfect amount of sweet and peanut sauce. The only thing this place ever lacks is service sometimes. I come alone all the time and sometimes a single table no matter where I go I end up being not in thier priority list. as long as my drink is filled and food is on time. I'm happy.

My husband and I arrived here at noon on a Saturday. Sure enough, the place was packed, but I think we waited less than 10 minutes. I will say, the pho broth here is very good. We both did enjoy our food and we finished everything. However, this place still doesn't compare to our ABSOLUTE favorite pho places back in California. My favorite pho place is in San Jose and his favorite pho place is in Antioch. Even though this place doesn't compare, it is the best pho we have had out here in Vegas so far.

    "text": "My family and I have been coming to this location of Pho Saigon 8 for over TEN years! Long before, my family and I enjoyed the food here because it's your traditional Vietnamese restaurant. However, we noticed how all the workers there would NEVER smile or made us feel welcomed. They all looked miserable and I've never seen a restaurant look that unhappy. No other restaurant fully satisfied the way this location did so we just kept coming back. As time past with each visit, we felt that the food wasn't worth the terrible service anymore so we stopped.   Now to the present, It has been about five years since I last ate there. I wanted to show my boyfriend one of the restaurants I used to LOVE as a child. I was willing to give them a second chance despite the crappy service.   Upon walking in, the restaurant was completely different than how it used to look. It seemed so much better with brighter lights and new seatings. It's just a whole new renovation! I was pretty excited to sit down and enjoy some hearty pho. I saw some familiar servers from years ago who still looked unhappy (haha). Lucky for us we got a different server.  Our server welcomed us to our table and handed the menus with a smile and a positive vibe. I ordered my favorite #11 noodle with rare eye of round, it's simple noodle and beef but simplicity at its best! My boyfriend ordered #21 noodle with rare eye of round, flank, brisket, tendon, and skirt flank. He chose that order specifically because it has a lot of meat in it.   Our pho tasted delightful and perfectly balanced. I admired that it was steaming hot and that the noodles were soft. The meat tasted a little bit plain but the broth made up for it. We also ordered a side of egg rolls which was so crispy with savor. I'm not a huge fan of veggies so I normally don't like eating vegetable egg rolls, but this was one of the exceptions!  Overall, I'm thrilled to see that this restaurant is improving itself little by little compared to how it was years ago! Slowly but surely believe they have the potential to be better if they just had friendlier service. Maybe next time, I'll invite my family to join so they can see for themselves. This location won over my second chance and I hope they won't lose it.",

Wanted to try this place instead of our regular go-to-pho which is VIET NOODLE BAR.  When we're settled down (BIG GROUP, 3 TABLES), server came by, dropped the menu right infront of my friends and I. It was literally dropped in a very disrecpecful manner. Then said he will be back to take order. I kept it to myself and let it go.   Before placing our orders, we specifically asked that our bills be separated because its 3 big families. There were 14 of us. Server said they will have it separated at the end when we all needed to pay by the counter.  Then he starts taking orders, he was rushing everybody and he acts like he doesn't give a sh*t! He talks to our group like, \"hey, you ready?\"  Finally our food arrived, this time a runner had them. After each orders where placed on the correct person, we asked that we get 3 extra bowls for the kids. Again, this one also has an attitude, smirked as he said yes!   During meal, I decided to open up about it to the group and also they felt irritated.  So we finished and ready to all pay by the counter. Then cashier said \"we dont split the check\" we are all like, what the hell, waiter told us cashier will do it. The lazy server took all our orders all in one piece of paper. When it should of been 3 different checks, but he said no problem. So then there was 2 guys already trying to tell my group that they wont split the check. I'm already infuriated so I said, in their accent, \"dis sum boosheet!\" Magically they can now split it. Like wow really?! My friends and I didnt mind paying it all in one bill but lying to us in the first place, thats what irritated us. If you said 1st thing when we asked you cant split it, fine, we pay in one bill, but the fact that you said you can split it at the counter is something different.  Here's the thing though, we love the food here, its great! Really can't go wrong with it! The bread they serve is so soft and flaky but the problem is the customer relation. It would of been better if the servers are robots, then we would understand that they dont have feelings.",

When you can see the long salt flakes on the edges of the bowls and feel yourself getting thirsty while you are drinking the soup, you know it's loaded up with msg. I would recommend against eating here if you are sensitive to msg.   The fish in the fish stew was so old it had freezer burn on it. But other than the frozen fish and msg overload, the food is decent and this place is open very late.",

    "text": "Long time goer but first time check in just for the fact how party and I were treated.   Everyone in Vegas knows that if you're not the countryman of the restaurant you're eating at, you're not going to get the best service. This especially True in this location. In the past I've received so-so to fair service. Seated and order taken quickly, water refilled promptly after once or twice by bothering the servers. Their model is to serve you fast and turn you quickly.   This was not the case when my friends and I dined here. She is Nigerian and she brought her sister-in-law and cousin to check out this place as it is her favorite spot in town. We were not greeted promptly, nor seated when we walked in. However other guests after us were seated fairly fast.   We came at around 630pm so we knew we were coming during their dinner rush. In the past, when I have come here with friends, whether it was the lunch rush, the slow lull between rushes and previous dinner rushes, we were seated given waters and orders taken promptly.   This was not the same experience this time around. We were seated, given napkins and the guy left us alone for a long time. This was the start of the downhill experience. Tables around us were being sat and their orders taken while the four of us were looking around for a waiter to acknowledge our table.   When we finally got the attention of one waiter, they came to get our order and we had to ask for water after waiting over 10 minutes to be acknowledged. For a party of 4 and a child, guess how much water was given to our party. 2!!! ARE YOU F*ING KIDDING ME?! Bean sprouts and basil was placed in the center of our table and I asked for more because it was not enough for 3 large and 1 small bowls of pho that we ordered. We were seated in the central area of the restaurant that was half both half chairs and next to the christmas tree so we are dead center. A couple (white and asian) were seated next to us and after our orders were taken, the waitress took their order faster than we were shown.   When our food was delivered we had to ask for them to give us the remaining waters! I had to remind another server that we asked for more bean sprouts and basil but was not given to our table. I am a few bites in to my pho when I got a hold of another waiter and that finally gave us an even smaller portion of bean sprouts and basil. While looking over to a group next to our party, which was a party of 7 and a mix of white, asian and latino and they had 2 large plates of bean sprouts and basil. During this time my friend and I were looking around the restaurant and noticed that the v servers were being more interactive to the other tables and we were being ignored.  She and I looked at each other and we had the same thought. We were being ignored because the table was mostly African American.   We requested extra noodles for my friend's daughter and one of them to be dry so it was easier for her daughter to eat. Our request was ignored and given to her in broth.   Now the time came to place her to go orders for her husband and brother. Very surprisingly we received that much faster than anticipated. Definitely faster than we were being serviced for our dining experience. She was handed a large paper bag for her to go order. She went through to start separating her orders because it was going to two different households. Once again she was being ignored for her request of extra plastic bags.  Being petty now, she started asking for more to go containers because she had left over broth in her bowl that she wanted to save for her lunch the following day. Her sister-in-law also had leftovers and when she flagged a server down to ask for two to go containers they rudely brushed off her request and didn't fully listen and only brought one to go styrofoam container. Getting irked her treatment, she pointed at the other bowl of leftover broth and asked for another once since the server walked away the first time with fully comprehending what she asked for. He came back and with his back turned and talking to the group of 7 he reaches back and with enough force basically slams the to go cup in front of my friend's cousin and that WAS THE LAST STRAW!  Never have we been ever treated or serviced like this in the past and we for sure will not be coming back to this establishment ever again!",

The fried spring rolls are really great. 9/10 the vegetables are super fresh & the rolls always come out hot and crispy. We think the pho is really tasty. The last night we had pho the brisket was so perfect & flavorful. My 8 year old splits a bowl with me and we order a side of the amazing grilled pork! The flavor of the pork is out of this world...a little Smokey & sweet. Super yummy! The staff are all very friendly! We come here often due to it being a very clean restaurant.",

I ordered the #16 for myself. My pho had plenty of good quality meat, and we were given a good portion of veggies. I was given extra green onions and bean sprouts by our waiter which was very nice of him.   I enjoyed my pho but the broth was a tad bit on the bland side. I had to add a lot of hoisin and sriracha sauce to give it some pep. I'm also only giving a four star mainly because they were a stingy on the rice noodles, especially since I ordered a large and it didn't seem all different from the small.   The late hours are a big benefit, and I'm glad I can get some good food after most places are closed.",

I ordered 3 Pho's, with 2 appetizers and waitress said she could not honor coupon from YELP. I asked why? She just left and no one could rectify why. Pretty disappointed in your service if you are going to be offering coupons and free glasses of wine with entries.   Came here for lunch after checking out other places decided to come here because of the many reviews it has. The restaurant is spacious a lot of tables, the servers are friendly and helpful and very fast! We sat down and immediately had water served. Our order came out in minutes and it was very fresh. I absolutely love Pho and can say it was very very good! I will definitely be coming here again.",

My friends and I were munching on the flat noodle sate, Bun Bo Hue, shaky beef and some strong Vietnamese iced coffees.  Portions were reasonable and everything was well seasoned. Shaky beef is a must order and so is their BBH. It packs some heat. This spot is very popular with the locals and I saw plenty of diners early in the AM.",

And it goes without saying that you typically won't find the best service at any Vietnamese restaurant but the server we had was straight up rude. Looked annoyed when I asked to sit at another table when she was trying to seat us right by the kitchen traffic when there were plenty of seats available elsewhere.   Waited a good 10-15 minutes for our pho when it would usually take less than 10 (not a busy night either). Food was meh. I mean, it'll get you by in a pinch but I don't recommend eating here anymore. Got the most watered down Bun Bo Hue I've ever seen. Not at all how it used to taste (or look). Adding insult to injury, the cups, spoons and bowls were dirty too, wth! Such a bummer, this used to be my all time favorite pho spot. 63 check-ins. But not anymore. Skip this place head down the street to Viet Noodle Bar. Phenomenal tasting pho and great service (if you can believe that!). You won't have to beg for napkins, straws, water refills, or your check like you have to here lol!   Sorry Pho Saigon 8, you've changed. :(",

It is flavorful, well priced, not over oily and not bland like youre eating dish water soup. Their spring rolls are amazing as well. I brought my kids one night and got the vermicelli and rice dishes - they demolished it!  The ONLY downfall to this place is the service. Sometimes they are a little lax and dont come around often enough. Some of the waiters dont listen to what youre actually asking for(condiment wise not food), and appear extremely rushed.

It is on the expensive side for Vietnamese noodle soup.  The extra large bowl was $8.25 but the size is just a regular size bowl when compare with other restaurant.  A good thing - they do wash and clean their bean sprouts.  The rice and pork chop just come with 1 piece of very THIN AND DRIED CHOP with plenty of rice - again not much food for the amount that they charge for the dish.  NOT GOOD.  I have to agree with a couple of other reivews.  NOT MUCH SERVICE.  They just drop the food.  NOT VERY HELPFUL asking about the menu.   COMMUNICATION IS LIMITED.   WATCH OUT FOR THE MANDATORY 15% TIPs FOR PARTY OF 6 OR MORE -  EVEN THEY ARE NOT VERY HELPFUL WITH THE SERVICE.  IT IS BURIED IN THE BILL.  I ENDED UP PAYING THE TIPs TWICE FOR NO SERVICE.  WATCH OUT!  The bill was a little over $100 for a party of 6.  I think there are better choices to go for the amount that we spent.",

After getting my beverages with a few minutes looking at the menu, I gave my order and started to read the local Filipino (English language) newspaper.  I swear, my hot steaming bowl of pho came out in less than five minutes.  Granted, I know that the ingredients for pho are probably ready (\"mise en place\") to get it out to the customer but it was quick.  Twenty minutes from walking in to walking out?  I know where I need to go if I need to eat with no time on the clock.  And it was good food (item #18, and the broth was a bit saltier than I like).  I didn't get a chance to case the joint, as I was given literally the first table as you walk in.  But, I saw Viet families and some other non-Asian folks enjoying their meals.  Since it is farther away from the Strip, I would assume the clientele is more civilized and respectful (re: not drunk, no loutish behavior).  Will try out the other pho joints, but Pho Saigon 8 is a good Mom and Pop to seriously consider.",

They have bigger bowls at Pho Kim Long. Over all I say its not bad. I will come back here just because the Pho was great. Service could be better but hey no one said you have to be happy at work.

    "text": "I am an absolute fan of vietnamese food and have eaten at many restaurants.  This one definitely stands out from the others and I know there are a lot of vietnamese restaurants to choose from in that area.  When my family traveled to Las Vegas, we actually dined here twice because we were pleased to find such a great restaurant the first time.  The broth is what I consider the most important part of a good bowl of noddle soup.  The beef AND seafood broth were both spectacular and delicious.  I like the atmosphere and the quality of the pieces of meat. Only bad thing is the price.  I do not like how there are other restaurants just down the street for a more affordable price for a little less  in expectations.  That knocks it down one star.  The restroom is a bit dirty but its nothing extreme.  You should go try it out!",

    "text": "This review is so troubling for me because of my deep love for Pho Saigon 8 on Eastern Ave. I am a regular there and have never experienced anything less then great, efficient service and consistantly high-quality food. I don't know how they were ever able to open a second location based on the first. Yikes.  My friend and I walked up to the front door only to have 3 employess with aprons and name tags on smoking in front of the front door. Literally blocking the entrance. One opened the door while talking over us with his cig in his mouth. It was a disgusting way to enter a restaurant (ithrough a plume of smoke) especially when you're starving.  Upon walking in,  nobody said anything until we asked if we just seated ourselves. The employee, looking bothered by the interuption, asked how many and looked behind him and pointed to any table. Never even stepping away from his task. So, she and I chose the closest table. We then had to ask for a menu which appeared to annoy them as well. She and I were kind of in disbelief as we wondered if we should even stay? Afterall, we have both frequented the second location and enjoy it so. A woman came to the table and stood there, never asking anything. My friend ordered her Thai tea and I ordered the same with boba. The woman left. When the tea arrived I can tell you fairly (not because of the awful experience) that the tea was watered down and the boba was mealy. So gross. I didn't finish it.  When the waitress came back, she stood there for a minute and said \"do you know what you want?\". Again, another sign that we should have departed.   We did have a good laugh that the menu prices were crossed out with marker and re-written in with higher prices.   The food came quickly and of the quality I am used to which was a nice relief from the otherwise disappointing experience. Nobody ever came back, we had to get what we needed ourselves from other tables. I saw another server holding his pack of cigs on the floor in front of tables. He eventually went outside as well. When finished, we went to the register only to see both people behind the register eating Balut with their hands only stopping momentarily to take people's money while still chewing. No handwashing, people. BLECK.  By this point we were especially grossed out at the sanitary standards (smoking servers went right back to work, no handwashing) and wanted to get the heck out.  I am almost so bummed out by this experience that I don't even want to go back to the Eastern location!  What. A. Shame.",

Cleanliness, there was a fly in the bowl of my noodle soup... need me to say more???  Service, worst than their food.  Waitress turned her back on us when we tried to order, didn't apologize when I told her about the fly and just took the bowl away.   The manager DEMANDED that we have to leave tips because we had 10 people when we don't want to.  We paid for our food without gratuities, the manager ran after us and said that we eat and run, and he's going to call the police to report us.  All these time I thought gratuity = reward for good services  Pho Saigon 8, this was my first and last.  Before you tell anyone that we're cheap, please tell them the real reason why we didn't want to leave tips.  Just for your information, this is the very first time I left a restaurant without leaving tips regardless I have been to many bad restaurants but your service trump them all.",

    "text": "I am not normally big on Pho, but there are times when one could use a good hot broth. I am staying in Vegas for the winter, and tried the Pho at Pho Huong Saigon on Decatur as it is closest to me. The experience there had me thinking there MUST be better Pho around, particularly as this is Las Vegas's asian strip with many Viet Pho places.   So I  yelped and found the highly rated Pho Sai Gon 8.  I went there and found it to be crowded for the lunch rush - a good sign I thought. I order the chicken Pho, with both white and dark meat.   5 minutes later the Pho arrived, packed with meat and noodles. I dug in.  The good:  - Excellent quantity of food.  - Lotsa flavor.  The not so good  - The broth was oily and the saltiness reeked of MSG. For the first time ever eating Pho, I didnt drink most of the broth. - The meat was tough and remained so as it sat in the broth. - The service was perfunctory, with the crowds of people. I left a dollar because someone did come along and refilled my water, otherwise I was left alone. - The Pho was pricey at 7.50 for a large bowl.  For the first time ever leaving a Pho place, I left unfulfilled and wanting food. I considered going to the cheap and cheerful BBQ King chinese joint behind Pho Saigon 8, but settled for a sardine Bahn Mi at the little bakery in the mall.  With all the choices around on Spring Mountain, I wont be back at Pho Saigon 8.",

The menu is concise, standard Viet. They actually have stuff, too. We've been to other joints and ordered menu items that are no longer available. They haven't been available. They will never be available. What, you can't change the menu or something?   One time, on a whim, we just tried the pennyworth drink. Had no idea what it was. It tasted like grass.

We waited 5 minutes and were seated and I ordered my usual Pho Dac Biet, beef noodles with everything. Their broth was really good with not much oil which is surprising. The noodles were cooked perfectly, not too soft with a bit of bite left to them. The meat was also cooked well, the tai, raw meat, was really tender. The gan, tendon (my personal favorite), was also nice and soft. I wish they had culantro but at least they had limes, basil, jalepenos and bean sprouts which is a must. My friend got the Goi Cuon, the summer rolls, and they looked pretty good with the shrimp and pork. The cafe den da and sua da, iced coffee with sugar or milk, was definitely strong and kept me up which was the point. When I come to vegas again I definitely will come again and try their Banh Canh, thick rice starch noodles, with either the traditional shrimp and pork hocks or the thick orange soup with crab.",

Born and raised in NYC's Chinatown I definitely know my Pho.  My gf is Vietnamese and from Boston where the Pho is even better than in NY.  Pho is all about the broth.  I, for one, love my soup dark, beefy, and with a little bit of oil from the bones of the beef.  Pho Saigon 8 has a much lighter broth in color and taste.  It does however, give it a more refreshing and cleaner tasting broth.  *If your broth tastes like its missing something, add some Fish Sauce (Nuoc Mum), but be warned, a little goes a long way!) The deep fried egg rolls/spring rolls were ok as were the summer rolls.  I like mine made with the white rice paper instead of the generic yellow eggroll paper.  It has little air bubbles popped on the skin that gives the eggroll/spring roll some added crunch and texture.  The summer rolls looked fresh and tasted good with the peanut sauce. The limeade soda (Soda Chanh) is good.  Many locals have prasied this place and I can see why.  Not a bad spot to get some Pho.",

We got several recommendations and we couldn't decide, so we randomly picked a place.  Luckily we picked Pho Saigon 8.  We were seated right away and by the owner no less.  We ordered the following: egg rolls, spring rolls, 2 special pho bowls, 1 cubed tender beef dish, and 1 rice with grilled pork.  The egg rolls and the spring rolls were pretty standard for vietnamese apps, although the dipping sauce for the spring rolls was better than usual.  The bowls of pho were good and the pieces of meat were generous.  The beef dish had such tender big chunks of meat that were cooked to perfection.  The pork dish was standard, but tasty nontheless.  This was a welcomed escaped from the over priced food and buffetts on the strip.  Total bill was around $50 for 4 of us and my favorite part of the meal was my green soy milk, mm mm sooo good.  I highly recommend this place to any wary travelor to Vegas.  Hope this helps!",

    "text": "I feel like there must be an alternative pho universe here when I hear people talking about how this restaurant is so awesome and gives too much beef. I guess they've shrunk them down so much that we are made to believe we are getting more even though it's actually less. We usually go to Pho 8 or Pho So #1. All the Pho start at a large for $8.55. You can ask for smaller but it defaults at large. Business tactic I presume. Any other place you are given a small at a lower price and not the other way around. I always order #13, beef and flank. The noodles came out bunched up, as if they took it out from the bin and stuck it into the broth soup without giving it a light cooking. The last 2 times I came, I thought the broth was too cold because it couldn't fully cook my meat. This time it was hot. It's getting a bit inconsistent. I got a little turned off by some cream in my bean sprouts and spearmint leaves. They were polite and grumbled it must've come from the jalapeno. Really? I quickly ran to the restroom to check my forehead. Afraid my better half wrote stupid on it that morning when I woke up late. But they brought me another. It's just not normal to have cream in a Pho restaurant. But at least they gave me a new one. Whipped cream isn't a big deal but I was afraid it might be silicone or something. Asian restaurants aren't the cleanest in the world I hate to say.  As for the beef, you get the same if you order small or large. They just give you more noodles pretty much. I thought it could use a few more pieces given the large bowl of noodles. Normally I get beef on the side but it's pointless if the broth is not boiling hot so I stopped asking for it on the side.  There's really no favorite Pho place for me anymore. #1 has gone down ever since I heard they opened a second location and moved the cooks there. Now the soup tastes more fatty and oily. The broth here is not fatty or oily.",

One example is Viet Bistro - their pho broth tasted like artificial pho seasoning diluted in water served in a bowl.  Big mistake serving that to Vietnameses b/c they'd never pay to eat your crappy food twice.  You'd, of course, find many Vietnameses eating at Pho 8...that's a very good sign!",

For me, a regular bowl has always been big enough to satisfy my hunger. The portion sizes may not be as big as the ones at Pho So 1, but are very well worth the money. The soup is great and doesn't taste as much of MSG as many other pho places do, the meat comes out fresh and red like it's supposed to, and the noodles are neither under- nor overcooked. Of course, soybean sprouts and limes are served with the bowls, as well.   The service is good. I have yet to find an authentic Vietnamese restaurant where the servers actually smile at their customers, but they're getting the job done. Since there is no hostess, and the waiters are often busy, customers often just seat themselves. Once the customer is seated, the servers will quickly come over and take the order. I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 minutes for my food to come out after ordering it. While the customers are eating and talking, the servers are good with keeping the drinks refilled and following up on any other requests.  The bill is paid up at the cash register. There is always someone there, and the cashier is pretty fast, so customers can walk out almost immediately after they finish their food. This is my go-to Pho place. Remember to tip!",

I usually order the house special (pho dac biet) with a side of rare beef, green onions in oil, pickled red onions, and a Vietnamese coffee to boot. It's usually my first stop into town before I check in and my recovery food after a marathon of clubbing.  If I still have room left over I order the three color dessert.  By the way, I'm Vietnamese and can get particular when it comes to my native food.  It's a good sign when you walk into a Vietnamese restaurant and see a good portion of the clientele Vietnamese.  When I want to eat Vietnamese food in Orange County I got to Bolsa/Westminster and nowhere else and when I'm in LV I go to Saigon 8 off of Spring Mountain.  Why settle!",

I can't believe that their food portion size went down & their quality of food went way down stream.  I am not sure if I wanna come back and have another Pho here any time soon......  Maybe, the chef went on vacation or something??!?!?  I am not too sure if  Pho Saigon 8 is worth recommended to you as I had both pleasant and not-so-pleasant experiences.

I found out about this place from my GF and hot damn if it isn't one of the better pho places around Vegas.   When you arrive the parking lot has ample spaces for you to park. Walk into the restaurant and you are hit with the scent of pho all over and you'll feel your hangover start to subside. Their iced coffee with milk is awesome as well. It's the old school drip style that drips into a glass with a layer of condensed milk at the bottom. When the coffee finishes, pick up the strainer and be hit with this aroma of some good coffee and you'll feel awake before the coffee even touches your lips. If you want to feed our hangover they also have a small selection of beer as well.  They have all the standard fare pho and dark/white meat chicken pho which is just as good as the beef. Regular or large bowls are available. If you're feeling rice they also have that along with other standard apps like spring/egg rolls which are just as good.  The only dessert I ever get at Vietnamese restaurants is Che Ba Mau...if you don't know you're missing out. Their Che Ba Mau is ok but nothing really to write home about. It's a good finisher if you've still got room for it at the end of the meal.  My only gripe with this place, which is only because when I'm full I feel pretty lazy, is that you have to walk up to the register to pay for your meal. I think of it as a good thing though because you're forced to get up and move after you eat a good meal instead of vegeing out while you wave your hand up to get *makes writing check motion* the check.",

We seriously conversed and observed for a good 30 minutes to see if others were given checks. We then realized people were walking up to cashier and saying their table number. Needless to say, we felt stupid...cashier laughed it up also.  On to the food, we ordered spring rolls, meatball pho, and veggie pho. The spring rolls were excellent, fresh veggies served alongside these little deep fried packets of awesome. Always wrap them in lettuce dipped in sarachi, epic. The pho was extremely flavorful!!! The broth was savory and just a little hint of mint at the end of the taste which is exactly how I like it.  Service was extremely fast, streamlined by the ordering process which is a plus and a minus. A plus for speed but a minus for personalized service: seriously, my only gripe, otherwise Pho Saigon 8 is a lock!!! Try it!!!",

We ordered 2 different bowls of pho and an appetizer of deep fried Vietnamese egg rolls. The egg rolls were actually pretty good, however the pho was terrible.  Trust me people I am well versed in the world of pho and when I say it sucks, it sucks. The broth was the most uneventful bland liquid I've tasted in a while.  I shouldn't need to continuously doctor up my pho by adding ingredient after ingredient to provide my taste buds with the slightest resemblance of flavor.    Ok so the food sucked. Fare enough, lets leave.  Easy feet to accomplish right...wrong.  God forbid you get somebody to acknowledge you after your food has arrived.

To make matters worse, I ordered the chicken pho thinking that it would be perfect for a hangover.  As I stirred the noodles around, a dead spider came floating to the top.  How authentic!  I nearly threw up.  Being that I wasn't gonna get any more fluids than from this bowl of spider pho, I fished the little guy out and took a few sips.  I would later pay for this mistake 1 hour later by spewing chunks not from my mouth, but from the other end.

All that aside, I liked it!    Combined with the fact the service was pretty unfriendly, and the pho wasn't any better than a couple of other spots I've been to in town, I probably won't be going back.  2.5 stars and rounded up to 3 stars for the overall experience, I guess.",

However, last night as I ordered the Vietnamese Egg Rolls, I noticed a gnat on the lettuce. It grossed me out a little bit. I know that these things sometimes happen, but obviously the lettuce wasn't just washed. According to the bf the egg rolls are lacking in size (he's comparing them to the Pho So 1 egg rolls). I think its decent for what it is and the price is reasonable.",

If you have never been to an \"authentic\" Asian restaurant, I'll let you know that you need to send a friendly wave when you need something.  It isn't impolite, and is actually customary.

Besides you will save more money eating off the strip.  The place was very clean and staff friendly.  No long waits at dinner time and our food was served immediately.  We ordered the Pho with steak and Bun Tom Thit Nuong (grilled shrimp and grilled steak with Vermicelli noodles).  For starters we ordered some fried Spring Rolls.  Very good!  Overall the food was very good.  The restaurant was twice as big as any Vietnamese Pho place we have ever been.  Very clean and staff friendly.  Fast service but a little overpriced.  For instance 4 spring rolls for $5.95, in California you get 6 for that price.  A larger size bowl of Pho was priced at almost $7.95, a dollar more than Cali.    Food   =    B Staff     =   B+ Decor  =   B+",

Eggrolls were no good - soggy and lacked flavor.  It came with only a little pork as well.  My friend got spring rolls - those weren't very good either.  Some got the pho, which I did think tasted flavorful and good.  The small size was too small for my firend, though, which is why she ordered the spring rolls.  Peanut sauce was not that great either.  And another got this red, spicy looking beef udon soup.  I didn't try it, but she loved it.  By the time we left, there was a line of people waiting.  Oh, they serve Vietnamese coffee in those little metal strainers, which then drips into a cup of a ton of Condensed Milk.  They gave us cups with ice.  OMG - the coffee was so good.  It wasn't the usual Cafe du Monde, which has a distinct chicory taste, but way better.  Both my friend and I raved about the coffee.  Service is pretty bad, too.",

Nice, clean restaurant, a little small but they make it work, and it has working AC! Something Pho So 1 was lacking.  I ordered the Large #26 which has tendon, tripe, brisket? I can't remember perfectly but it is my go to set of meats in my pho.  The pho was good. Tasty and not too salty.  My only complaint is that the pho needs more noodles, a little more meat and more jalepenos to put in it.  I did read someone's else review that said she usually orders 2 larges and I should of.  A large just has more soup? Does that make sense? I felt like I was not full but hungry.  I could have eaten another bowl definitely.  The spring rolls were great also.  I would definitely good again and get more food.",

I told the server right away and he took it to the back without telling me a word of what he planned to do.  Pho Ga:  Ugh, could someone please tell me why yelpers are saying the broth is flavorful and yummy?  Far from yummy, the diluted soup tastes like boiled water with a splash of chicken broth and a little salt.  Could not eat half of this bowl.    The only thing they had right:  Vietnamese coffee.

About 5 mins later my pho came out, but not my friend's bbh.... we had to yelled out at the server to get her attention and asked where's my friend's order? Did you guys forgot about it? Honestly, We were about to leave that place but my friend had an appointment at next door salon, so we tried to be more patience... So when her food came out, she had few bite and had to run.

That is not proper customer service right there. When she asked what we want to order, we did our best to order our food in our Vietnamese language. Don't get me wrong, yes, my siblings and I looked white, but we're actually Vietnamese in ethnicity too. She complained to my older brother and asked him why not let them speak in English. I'm like, wow, are you being serious? So after she took our orders, she whipped out 3 forks and some chopsticks because she assumed we don't know how to use chopsticks. This seemed kinda racist and should've asked if we needed any forks before bringing it out to the table. Terrible. Food was okay, not the best, but we can live with it. Sorry Saigon 8, but you disappointed me this time.",

My boyfriend said he was going to take me to china town for pho. The miracle cure for sickness. I surely didn't believe him.   Walking in I was amazed by the aroma of the building which was beefy goodness.   Being seated immediately we were given menus but every single pho item looked too similar. How the heck was I supposed to make a decision?! When the waiter came I took trust in his experience and asked if he would order for me and I let him know I was ill. He looked my boyfriend and I up and down and said two #16. One small for you, one large for you. We laughed and said we would also order a side of egg rolls for an app.   The egg rolls appeared within minutes. When we entered the place was half full and now we noticed the place was packed. Great sign! The egg rolls were in a translucent wrapper and you could see the shrimp and veggies. It was very meaty and fresh and was accompanied by a peanut sauce that looked like gravy. I mixed the red pepper sauce with the peanut sauce to get a spicy salty sauce for the egg roll. Yum!  Next the pho came and my boyfriend immediately said he could have gone with a small bowl. I was a little reluctant as I am picky when sick and the fresh fish that it came with was weird. I'm not used to getting a dish with bean sprouts, fresh herbs and jalapenos with my soups. Alas I trust my boyfriend and dug in. My pho first off was only 8.60 had tons of brisket in it (and another meat I cannot remember) noodles, and onions. My favorite. The broth was the best broth I've ever had in my life and I've had tons! Speaking from experience was I ate only broth for 4 weeks after my tonsils and muscle lining underwent removal. The broth was beefy, flavorful and had depth. There was an enormous amount of meat. Every sook full had meat and onions. The fresh herbs when added kicked up the flavor. After finishing about 1/4th of my bowl my lungs expanded. No joke instantly I felt relieve.. I could breath! Next I could breath through my nose as well. My fatty self couldn't stop and I ate the entire bowl.. Feeling completely better. I was amazed. So amazed I asked to have another bowl of it to go for work tomorrow in case tomorrow morning i woke up sick.   This is gonna be my go to place when I'm ill.",

    "text": "This place is pho-tanstic!   Two of us arrived on a quiet afternoon and filled our table with fresh spring rolls, hot coffee with condensed milk, and two huge bowls of pho. The spring rolls had an abundance of ingredients tightly wrapped within. You can see through the sheer wrap and find large pieces of shrimp. Dip it into the peanut sauce and savor each bite. The hot coffee was particularly refreshing since we were both sleep deprived. My bowl of pho had rare eye round steak, flank, brisket, and soft tendon. The broth was the star. The flavor was so blatant that you can tell they spent hours putting this concoction together. The broth had a tight grasp on each strand of pho making you yearn for more after each bite. The meat was tender as well but the soft tendon really did the works for me. It was so delicate and spongy that it absorbed most of the broth. Each bite came with a burst.   This is another surprising find that I will look forward to repeating when I am in the area.",

Today I found a roll of plastic wrap about an inch wide of some sort in my pho. I tried to ask the waitress what that was, she said sometimes that gets in there and quickly took it from the table and ran off. Because of that, I will not be going there again. Because I didn't like her answer. And I take off 2 stars. I will stop at my 9th check in, bye Felicia   Haven't been to this place since I found the plastic in my pho, thought I'd see if it's worth going back, lol still the same, that old lady waitress still don't smile, bad service, so I will stay away a few years and maybe I'll try again or not.

I asked if they could put my rare beef on a separate plate (bc I like it very rare), but they wouldn't do it bc they said there's \"too little meat to separate.\"   My family loves the durian smoothie here because they use real, fresh durian. They have filtered water.  Spring rolls are expensive; they're like $5.35 for two rolls. When they came, the rice paper was still a bit wet, which was a great way of telling me that they're fresh, but premade. It's pricy, but I love these spring rolls and the stuff they put in it. The shrimp are a decent size as well!",

My parents just returned from Vietnam and commented that the broth here was much more flavorful than what they ate over there.   I feel the portions are decent for the money, my only request would be more tendon pieces with the pho. Everything was cooked well, my parents did not like the appetizer - it was a sausage wrapped in a spring roll. I thought it was okay.   It wasn't too full on a Friday night, but the food was fresh.",

The first time I tried this place years ago, it was really good and then I came back again around 2012. I noticed even that visit in 2012 wasn't as great as my first visit. Now, 2014, I found out the old owner had left which explained the decline in EVERYTHING for this restaurant. Customer service AND food were absolutely horrible. Gordon Ramsay needs to host this place in Kitchen Nightmares!  The server had a horrible attitude and wouldn't let me make modifications. Hello, you're a vietnamese restaurant, not a high end michelin star place so slow your role! In the end she still got my order wrong. I ordered the chicken vermicelli w/ cha (steamed egg quiche) w/out vermicelli. My order came out w/ vermicelli and NO cha. I figured maybe she forgot and it wouldn't be in the bill so I didn't bring it to her attention, but after we got the bill we noticed she did charge us for it!  Chicken Vermicelli - Noodles were over cooked, chicken was disgusting. I've never had chicken as dry as the NV desert in the summer. There was no flavor to the marinade either and too much black grill marks. TBH, they used chicken thigh and it shouldn't be this dry/bad. This is probably the first time I couldn't finish my plate because the food was so bad. Normally I hate wasting food so I would suck it up and try to finish it, but this was just beyond edible.  Chicken broken rice plate - Again, same crappy chicken that I had in the vermicelli. Rice was super old and dry. Everything seemed microwaved  Pho tai bo vien - The beef was overcooked as well as the noodles. The bo vien was ok  Bun Cha Hanoi - OVERCOOKED PORK, again marinade was off. At least the veggies seemed clean & fresh  Mi cha siu kho - the cha siu (bbq pork) was like rubber/microwaved. Again, my friend couldn't finish this plate either  Cha gio (egg rolls) - not the best I've had, outershell wasn't crispy enough. Was too oily  Bo luc lac - Normally anything w/ oyster sauce & garlic seasoning/marinade should taste good, but this dish like all the others weren't palatable. Plus the portion was small for the price  So basically we paid and left hungry still. Never coming back",

    "text": "There was about a year and a half where my best friend and I came here every Monday for post-workout pho, sometimes, even without having actually worked out. As far as Vietnamese entrees go, I'm sure I'm just scratching the surface, but I've had vermicelli (cold noodles with veggies, meat and fish sauce), rice plates, pho (noodles with assorted meat, usually in beef broth) and the French-Vietnamese sammiches. This place wins at the first three. I actually haven't even checked the menu to see if they have sandwiches because the other stuff is pretty darn good.  Both the fresh spring rolls (pork and shrimp), and the deep fried spring rolls (wrap them in lettuce with pickled veggies and dunk in fish sauce) are good ways to jump off the meal. For drinks, I like their hot tea and the Thai tea was surprisingly good as well.  In terms of actual belly filling picks, I prefer either pho or vermicelli to the rice plates, and depending on the season, will heavily lean towards one or the other and consistently order that every time. Obviously, when cold, I'll get pho, and when it's hot, I'll order vermicelli (try the grilled pork with fried spring rolls!).  I've tried Pho Kim Long (har har har), and felt it just didn't stack up to Pho Saigon 8. This is definitely my favorite Pho place in Vegas.",

It is well west of there.  One reviewer mentioned smelling the fish sauce at the table.  Sorry, they don't have fish sauce at the table unless it comes with the specific food you ordered.  They have srirocca (hot sauce) and hoisin (sweet sauce) at each table.  I don't know how you can complain about service here.  You are given a table, and a waiter quickly comes to take your order.  If you order pho, which I usually do, it takes three to five minutes to arrive.  There are three types of broth for the pho, and all are delicious.  I have been to Pho Saigon 8 scores, perhaps hundreds of times over the years, and never received a poor dish or bad service. I consider it the best pho in town, and it is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  Oh, and I have met several of my favorite Vietnamese professional poker players here.",

They are smaller, less flavorful and not as fresh.  The pho broth and noodles taste as if they use less MSG than most other places which is a good thing.  The meat portion in their dac biet is about average.  They do offer the same wide variety as many other vietnamese places, one thing i do advise people not to order is there bun cahn sai gon #42.  Horrible dish, gelly like soup, and during the time i ordered it, the noodles were hard and not prepared properly at all.",

I'd give it a 3/10, it was cloudy, salty, and probably not fresh.  The really bad: the banh xeo here is quite literally the worst i've ever had in my -entire life-. Not only was the batter terrible, but it appears that they may have just pre-made the \"shell\" and baked it, microwaved some bean sprouts and shoved it in there.  My advice: go to Jenni Pho or Que Huong instead.  The only reason this review does not have a 1-star is because those are reserved for restaurants that give me food poisoning or are filthy.",

Mi soup broth is great as well, they give u so many wontons.  2 sizes but both bowls are massive.  Favorite dish there is Com Tam Bi Cha Suong Nuong.  The pork chop is tender/great flavor compared to other spots and their egg cha is superb.  I normally am unimpressed with egg cha at other places even tho i love it, so its awesome that I'm able to enjoy it again.  And their Bi is not overly dry which is great.    The restaurant is big and their turn around time for tables are quick even though they get busy alot.  Service is a hit or miss.  I mean its a vietnamese restaurant, ur not gonna be catered in royalty.  Just expect your first requests for items to not come and be patient to flag them or someone else down for it again.",

They'd probably get the same amount of business as PKL with how delicious their entrees are. I'm going to keep comparing both Pho Saigon 8 to PKL just because in the Pho business out on Spring Mountain, PKL really has the title for \"Best of Las Vegas.\" I believe this place has so much potential if only they'd consider making some arrangements that can pull in the interest of foreigners, travelers, and even locals. Their food is mouth-watering; I can't even begin to explain! I love ordering their Korean BBQ and they're not even a Korean Restaurant! Their Pho tastes so authentic as well! I love how their selections, so much goodness in such a limited menu. I really suggest you give this place a try. Don't expect too much from the environment but their food is off-the-charts amazing :)",

I went here 2 more times by myself and got the same thing, it was around 10 am on a weekday when I had these heavenly encounters. The service was impeccable. Then on a Saturday morning I decided to share this with my family, and the service was very slow, and the tendons were not added in the soup. Also, I tried the fresh rolls for the 1st time, and they were too sticky, the rice paper was too moist! So... the reason for my 4 stras: Try not to go here during busy times..other than that, this place and the soup is awesome!",

    "text": "Definitely my favorite place to get Vietnamese food.   Some other places offer great pho, but not much else after that. Other places offer not so great pho, while offering other great Vietnamese dishes. This place offers both.   The pho especially has great broth, which is served piping hot. And the portions are pretty decent for the prices. The restaurant itself is pretty clean as well, something you might not find at other establishments.   Service is a hit or a miss for me though. 80% of the time service is better than most other establishments. The other 20% isn't bad service, just mediocre. They're pretty fast and attentive, but few speak English.   Don't forget o get Vietnamese coffee when you go. =p",
