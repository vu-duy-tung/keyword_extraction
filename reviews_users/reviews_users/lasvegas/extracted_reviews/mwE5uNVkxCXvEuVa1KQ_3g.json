Ordered Nachos 5 sec after my friend did. They came out 15 min apart. Then my Nachos were noticeably smaller even after friends have been eating the other Nachos. No portion control or consistency. I ordered a beer with my Nachos but it seemed like the bartender didn't want to pour it, cuz he took forever to do so. The bartender acted like he didn't want to serve us and focus on his friends at the end of the bar. Idk but for the first time here wasn't that great. It wasn't even that busy. I was surprised for a Saturday night. All in all not worth it unless you live next door to one and can walk.",

As usual, the first drinks were finished quick and we're ready for more. The bartender was busy, but didn't seem to have that sense of urgency.  He would talk to people for like 5 min and then finally go to the next group to get the next groups drinks. Finally round 2  is served. Meanwhile, each of us are down over $40 in these tight machines.  The food comes and looks delicious.  Unfortunately there was no flavor in any of our pasta dishes. It was weird, cause it looked so good and I wanted it to at least taste ok, but NO FLAVOR!   Round 3 was served. No one asked how the food was. Maybe they know what the answer would be. Just to cut to the chase and finish this story, we had about 5 beers each and 3 shots. They comped 2 drinks!!! We were playing the whole damn time!! The absolute worst was when my friends girlfriend came to pick us up, there was some fight in the parking lot and a guy pulled a gun on the other guy! All these police came and had the guys on the side of the road!  Bartender was super slow to serve, machines super tight, food sucked, didn't comp drinks for players, and guns and police!

We love that there is a separate entrance and section for the restaurant so you can bring your kids. We had Megan as our server and although she was busy she was extremely sweet, attentive and all around a really great server!

    "text": "Two of us went on a Sunday night just for appetizers and drinks and to check the place out. I was a little worried it would be hard to find because there isn't much in Southern Highlands, but it's well lit. The only suggestion I would have is to put a sign right on Pyle and Decatur so that Pyle is easier to find. The bar was pretty full so we sat at a table. Server arrived right away with menus. The specialty drinks all looked pretty good. As far as cost they were a little more expensive than I expected but not Strip prices by any means. We ordered the Distiller's Delight and the Mad Mule. Both were tasty. We also ordered the mashed potato bites and the crab bites. The crab bites were a little on the pricey side but they were tasty as well. The mashed potato bites were bomb. I could have eaten another order of those if I had been so full. Our server was attentive, refilled our water, asked if we needed anything, so no complaints there. We moved to the bar after we ate as space had opened up. I overheard someone complain about how smoky it was, but I completely disagree. There were maybe three or four people smoking in the whole place. Bartenders were very attentive and checked on us several times. Really the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars are the prices. If you live in the area I would suggest you give it a go! We will go back again for sure.",

I was there the first weekend and service was awful. food was so so but i found it and cocktails pricy.But its new and was very crowded. i understand. Tried again last nite and not much better! service was better but not very friendly. this was noticed by all 4 of us there for dinner. Again not impressed with food and drinks are pricy for what tbis place is! glad to pay but make it worth it. i live very close and was excited to have it in our area. i will try again because i want it to be good and its close. i will review again.",

Didnt care for their salsa or their avacado egg rolls but really enjoyed their fried artichoke hearts (minus the mayo dipping sauce-surely you can come up with something a little more creative).  The fried calamari was excellent! Not rubbery and not overcooked-perfect coating-nice and crispy-yummy.   Prices are what you'd expect at a place like this meaning it was reasonable.  Super cool bar area!! Cozy and inviting.",

One i didn't know i was in Twin Peaks the woman  bartender walked around with her boobs all out and kept saying \"I gotta make my tips somehow\", if that was the case why doesn't she work at a strip club if she's so worried about her tips then her customers.. Im glad the gentlemen bartender was around because without him i would not been able to order a drink..   But i want to thank you for amazing food and amazing bartender, i believe his name was John.

The one thing I've had that I didn't care for was the burnt ends sandwich, but I'm sure others might like it - wasn't bad, just not my favorite.

The drink deals here are great as well, and the service is even better. All of the employees are friendly and attentive, especially the wait staff. My server Rachel was probably the best waitress I've ever had, she deserves a raise. The extra side of ranch she brought really made my sandwich (as well as my day) a spectacular one. Thanks Rachel. 10 points for Gryffindor.   If you've never been to Distill before definitely give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. Between great food, great entertainment, and even better service there's no other bar I'd rather spend my money at. Seriously all I can say about this place is...WOW!",

The mashed potatoe balls which many have recommended were less about the potatoes and more about the cheese, jalapeno, and generic Italian'esk breading, which strangely enough tasted like the same breading used on the mozzarella triangles.  The fish and chips were coated with a heavy thick batter which was soggy and undercooked and the chips were bland tasteless soggy luke warm bag fries.  Awesome.  My martini arrived on the rocks in some kind of mixed drink / beer glass, which, considering they have like 6 different kinds of martinis on the menu, theyd at least know how to serve them.  Having sat down in the bar area, we at least anticipated being able to have a few drinks and hang out, its not as though there were no other tables open, and we did have a 80 dollar cheque open.  Needless to say, as soon as we opted to not have dessert, our bill immediately arrived and the card was wisked away and returned 60 seconds later, which was THEE fastest service of the night.  I guess we're more interested in turning tables than having people order a handfull of 12 dollar drinks.",

After those two items .. nothing else is even worth mentioning. Mediocre soups lacking any kind of seasoning and a dry BLT that left my girlfriends face sadder than the amount of bacon on her sandwich. The worst part of all was the customer service. Our waitress was designated to the restaurant section away from the bar and struggled to manage the few tables that exist in this section. She managed to make us wait 15 minutes prior to greeting us or taking our drink down followed by an additional 15 minutes for delivery. This place was an embarrassing experience to say the least . I wouldn't recommend it unless I was already hammered looking for good bar food to sober up.",

    "text": "Third time here everything was great until midnight when the graveyard bartender came on shift. I have never felt so disrespected In a place of business in my life. I had a French martini with the previous bartender, who made it well (9:30pm John) my drink was perfect and it tasted  exactly like it's supposed to be made. I re ordered my drink at midnight as we were with a group of friends and the graveyard bartender delivered my drink tasting off. I  went over to the bar and asked the bartender what he made my drink with. He begin to explain what he thought was in the drink (wrong) instead of asking he was pissed off when I told him what was actually in the drink. He then prepared a new drink, as i waited at the bar. The new drink was prepared and delivered in front of me looking completely different and tasting different as well. When I asked the bartender If he thought the drink looked different than the previous prepared he ignored me... I proceeded to taste the drink and told him that the drink tasted differently as well. I told him I had no problem paying for both drinks but the first was almost undrinkable. He then swiftly grabbed the drink from me and immediately and abruptly poured it out in front of me... ignoring my concern. I sat back down with my large group of friends astonished by his disrespect and unprofessionalism. I told our waitress my concern who was very busy and a complete sweetheart. She notified our table that his name was Ryan and that she was very sorry on his behalf. How is \"Ryan\" about to work graveyard at a bar in Las Vegas and not know how to make a french martini.. Even so.. How do you allow yourself as a bartender to be offended when a customer patiently and politely tries to inform you on how to make a certain popular drink... And be rude and disrespectful to the customer. I am blown away by the lack of professionalism what a poorly run establishment if they allow rude bartenders to treat paying customer with disrespect during after hours... Is this how you train your employees? I will continue to notify everyone I know of this bar and the graveyard bartender and his lack of respect to customers. I am embarrassed for you distill. 1 star how horrible",

It was delicious. Wasabi dressing was refreshing, just the right amount of tuna, crispy won tons, savory warm roasted red peppers and cucumbers. AJ was our server and she visited our table numerous times to make sure our food was good or if we needed a drink refill. I definitely recommend this establishment and will return!",

Their staff is always polite and gives you that neighborhood vibe. Of all the gaming/local bars this is my go-to for the best food! My favorite thing to get is the Distill chicken sandwich it comes with bacon and avocado and I like to add jalapenos. Their bread is Always very fresh as well! (I always admire a place who uses fresh jalapenos over pickled) Everything from their house salad to wings to dessert are all quality items nothing is ever lacking! Thanks for being a staple in the Southern Highlands Community!",

If you are looking for a chill bar, dim lighting, TVs for sports watching, a few slot machines, plenty of seating, a couple couches, two pool tables, and light background music, then you would feel comfortable there. The ambiance works for a local neighborhood bar.  The food was overpriced and full of lackluster. The pretzel bites were equivalent to something you would buy in a grocery aisle and spray too much Pam on before microwaving. The mozzarella sticks looked really good, but were unremarkable. The buffalo sliders were more bun than chicken and the chicken was overcooked and very crunchy. The fries weren't great, they had no crispiness or flavor, and tasted like they had been frozen for a long while. The service was quick and attentive.   Don't go there for the food or expecting a drink selection beyond every other local bar. Go there because it's close and you just wanted a place to hang out, otherwise don't go out of your way.",

Everything on their menu is huge! I highly recommend the buffalo chicken wings. It is a great big portion and it tastes great. I like to get their house salad. It is only about $5, but it is sharing size. You can't go wrong with the sliders either, there are various types to chose from. The worst thing on their menu is the chicken pot pie....just don't order it or you'll regret it.  ATMOSPHERE: I love to come here with friends and play pool. It's one dollar per game. The staff is super friendly and quick with orders. It is a great place to hang out so it does get busy daily.",

The salad arrived, then the appetizer right after, and not two minutes later, the entree and burger, which was pretty much everything all at once. We had to ask the guy who brought them out to take them back until we could start the appetizer. My salmon was great, but the burger was almost raw.

I have to admit unless you're familiar with the area it's secluded and might be difficult to find. However, as a local bar to start coming to ... I enjoyed it. There are pool tables and different seating areas. If you just want to eat, or appear you're not in a bar, there is a restaurant section blocked off for non-smokers.  Our server was super friendly.  Since it's Ash Wednesday, the fiance and I decided to try the fish and chips.   The fish was a little too oily for me, but the fish portions were huge.  The drinks were reasonably priced.    Overall, I would come here again, bring friends, enjoy some drinks, and hang out !",

Spiced up the beer a bit. Food is - bar. Slightly overpriced. Calamari are equivalent to chicken fingers. Ahi - 2 oz for $12. Pretzel bites were pretzel bites. Pickle straws were mediocre. The bar is smokey and the \"restaurant\" is mini and enclosed in glass. From the bar the restaurant looks like a feeding zoo! Out of the 6 items we ordered (including drinks) they were out of 2. Cool light fixtures. Nice staff. Would return if I was taking someone home from the airport on a late night flight who lived in southern highlands and we needed a bite.",

Me and my  boyfriend came here after work for some food and drinks , I was craving their infamous mozzarella triangles we ordered those chicken wings and fish and chips .our bartender Aby suggested the fish n chips over another thing on the menu we were in between and let me just say I'm not the biggest fan of fish n chips but this order was amazing the fish was so fluffy and the batter was incredible ! Thanks again ! The wings were just as great and the mozzarella triangles never disappoint ! The service was great everyone behind the bar was so nice and helpful (for as busy as the bar was ) which was awesome I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area :)",

This time, there was no staff in the bar when we arrived at 3pm and we waited for 5 -7 minutes before ANYONE showed up. Our waiteress, Crystal, was nice and attentive. The manager ignored us, since we were only sitting at a table and not gambling. I mention this because he made a point to greet all of the guest that were playing video poker. Also, for the majority of the time we were here, the TWO bartenders could hardly stop talking to their friends sitting at the bar to wait on customers in a reasonable amount of time. We watched as multiple customers walked in, took a seat at the bar, and waited while the bartenders finished chatting with their friends to look around to realize that there was a new customer at the bar. This is the exact reason that we left without getting a drink the first time we tried this place.",

I like a neighborhood pub with video poker, decent food, and a chill ambiance - this isn't the place for that.  that jukebox is nightclub-loud!  A good chunk of people were hollering to communicate with one another in perhaps an attempt to ensure they were being understood but it just added to the cacophony of the place.  Some people might dig that and feel at home in a place where you can't hear yourself think but that's not my thing.  What really soured my experience were other rowdy patrons.  Not rowdy in the fun way but rowdy in the obnoxious way.  People who angrily scream f-bombs in some sort of misguided attempt for attention.  Looking 'round, customers and staff all were clearly annoyed but no one from the bar took the initiative to quell the brewing storm.  I cashed out and bailed from what I saw as an inevitable confrontation between those folks and the patrons who came to have a good time.",

I asked for the creamy dijon sauce on the side. I am a health-conscious eater. One of the bartenders asked me how I liked it, and she said how much she loves the food there and gave me an extra tip. She said she orders the chicken \"dry\", to avoid the oils/butter they use when making it. She also recommended the egg white omelette. Breakfast is served all day, so that is awesome.   I will definitely be getting the chicken dinner again and I will be trying an egg white omelette sometime.  Atmosphere is cool. Service was good. Beer selection is decent, but I'd prefer even more craft beers. Great addition to Southern Highlands, and I am looking forward to many visits here.",

We were greeted immediately and asked if we knew what we wanted, however we just sat at the table so wanted to look at their menu. Server came back and I ordered an Redd's Apple with Fireball shot (25 oz) and my boyfriend ordered a beer. Another server or manager came over and checked on us. She was very friendly. We also ordered the medium chicken fingers with sweet potato fries. It was pretty good & yummy. I enjoyed my beer. It was recommended by a friend. The cinnamon from the fireball shot kind of made my Apple cider taste a \"little\" like Apple pie.   Anyway, we received great service. They were very attentive and friendly. Also chatted with us. Plus the food came pretty quick. So that was good because I wanted to eat while I drank.   The atmosphere was cool. Not smokey in there at all or anything & had nice decor and lighting. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves there. I think there was also a birthday party going on in the lounge area. They also have pool tables & gaming machines in there.",

It is typically very slow so it's easy to get attentive service. At bars I typically get bacon and eggs. At Distill that also includes hash browns and toast. They are both fine. I believe the hash is probably frozen, but it is still tasty. There is no kids breakfast on kids menu so order one egg and bacon side a la cart for my 4 year old. Works out well for us as hash and toast is a lot of starch and we can split that easily enough.   Coffee has always been good. I take it with two creams so have to remember to remind server to bring more cream with refill (they consistently bring 3 with first cup).   Only real complaint - Door faces east and metal handle is not covered. Really?! It's Vegas that metal gets hot. Cover it for goodness sake.   Bottom line I'll keep coming here for breakfast.",

Similar to their sister restaurant Remedy, they offer all ages family dining / a non smoking environment in a small fishbowl of a room just to the side of the bar.  Of course, you have to walk through the smoke to get there - smoke so heavy that you need to change clothes to get rid of the smell.   Don't get me wrong, I love a dive bar.  I lived at Dinos for about a month.  But Distill falls somewhere in the middle of a dive bar and a restaurant- and unfortunately on my visit they fell hard.   As for the food, I had their new braut which tasted very off. And the seared ahi, which was underwhelming.    Despite the taste of the food, the service was friendly and prompt.",

You seat yourself but the servers greet you very quickly. The drink selection is great and the menu has a big variety of food. The prices are pretty awesome, 4$-$20, for appetizers to full meals. They carry craft beers and the normal beers. Have great sounding cocktails.   They have a good music selection and it's not too loud inside. Many televisions and casino games to be entertained by, they also have arcade games and 2 pool tables! They have a personal jukebox for the entire place where the customers play the music they want. Just download the app. Nice atmosphere with cool lighting. They even have a nonsmoking area. They got a cool lounge area with classy seating. The booths are very well made too.   Highly recommend this bar to everyone, tourists and locals. Will definitely be coming back here! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  for a great night out without breaking the wallet!",

You can see the location on their FB like page.  At night it's lit up VERY well by the signs and the words on the building.

    "text": "This is a good bar with good food.   I have been here twice now, and it never seems to be very crowded, but that's a plus for me because I never have to wait. I like that the restaurant is glassed off from the bar, so it is quieter and appropriate for families. If you are looking to watch sports, this is a good bet.  I love the decor. The light fixtures are unique, and everything is dark, but it still feels clean and cool.   As for the food, it's all quality. I like the fried chicken sliders in particular. It's what I crave if I am craving bar food.   The service is a little touch and go. The servers are quick to take your order, and the food does not take very long, but once you have your food, the servers really seem to not check in too often. It's hard when you need something for your food or need a new drink. On the second visit, my order was also wrong. They were apologetic, but everyone else was done eating before I could even begin.   I will likely be back.",

While we realize it is St. Patrick's and it was busy, there is no reason that we should be sitting at a dirty table  (with the prior patrons' drinks, dirty ashtrays, and paid bill) for nearly 15 minutes, with at least 4 separate wait staff (3 girls, 1 guy) walking by without so much as an acknowledgment. We live 5 minutes away, as do a lot of our friends. We will suggest The Lodge at Cactus from here on out. We will not be back.",

We only got appetizers and they were decent for the price. The patio looks amazing (it was cold when we went) so we'll be back for drinks again.",

No, we should have been compensated for the coupon we were wanting to use. The food took forever to come out. My steak was tuff and cold.

    "text": "So we've tried this place three times in the past year and every time was a NIGHTMARE. last year just before 2017 Christmas time we came in about 1am and tried to get a beer and pretzel bites. Signed up for a players card , got a beer each for two of us. There were two male bartenders who both dissapeared after giving us our one beer and someone else delivering our pretzel bites. We had put in HUNDREDS each to the IGT machines and still not even a check in from bartender. After well over an hour after snack delivery (probably hour and half after initial beer delivery) I got pissed and went around bar to other side by bathrooms where the oversize graveyard bartender was chatting with a group of girls leaning over there machines like a king pin and hadn't moved for a LONG time. I told him umm excuse me but I want to close out my check since I can't get any service what do I owe you. He responds with ohhhh  I'm sorry no no no  you don't owe anything because you were playing. Even with the bad service I STILL tip him well and leave with NO intention to come back after such poor shit service and let it go figuring it was a one off. Had a similar experience shortly after and never came back.  Well today (grave 10/17) we came in around midnight after a long day of activities/work figuring hell with it we'll give it another go given it was so long ago. Well, said fat bartender who had NOBODY else in there did give the three of us our beers fast. We had two others in our group join us right after who weren't even drinking. Of the three of us drinking we had two drinks and a simple one shot cocktail. We had one small order of pretel bites and decided to go play pool since we were not game ling and the two non drinkers wanted to play.   This ended in disaster. Nobody EVER checked on us after two very long games of pool (none of us are very good players although we love the game). So eventually one of us went up and ordered a few more drinks from the bar for the drinkers. He said he came out of bathroom and stood by bar FOREVER while bartender bullshited with this group of three that had come in and sat on backside by bathrooms and caught his eye THREE times before he loudly said umm excuse me can I get another round of drinks??? Before bartender says oh oh oh yeah I'm sorry buddy. Keep in mind this was our first drinking stop of night so besides enjoying our game of pool we hadn't been drinking or out anywhere, just enjoying meeting some friends!!!!!!  After second round drinks we quit the pool, two of our five left and we went back to sit quietly at bar, pay our table and finish drinks to leave. When we went back to sit a new group of 3 had come in and start near our old chairs. One on our group  of remaining 3 made a joke with them to break the ice and sat near them with back turned and carried on our own conversation. We paid the tab, tip included and finished our beer. At this point one of the girls in this new group nearby us stumbled by us, plopped drunkenly in a chair and said to her friend very loudly \"I failed the breathalizer outside I have to order a ride\". My friend in our group of  three joked quietly still fcaimg us and I mean QUIETLY with back still turned to our new group of nearby patrons \"yep you failed\". That's it. He DID NOT engage in a conversation or nothing just made a QUIET remark over his shoulder to their loud stumbling drunken comments. Well the fat barkeep who refused to wait on us all this time decided to come running over from nearby and LOUDLY yell for all to hear \"hey buddy DO NOT yell at my other customers like that.\"  Embarrassed as all fuck because we had received SHIT service, been embarrassed and berated while these drunk dumb sluts got served on spot we walked PROMPTLY out the front door. We we're FURIOUS at our treatment especially after our shit service for the couple hours we were there. This fat bartender needs to be FIRED and I want a resolution!!!!! We will be taking this to management!!!!",

    "text": "Great little hidden spot. They're menu is awesome with a lot of variety, very reasonably priced and full bar. You can dine in their dinning room which has booths and tables or dine in the bar area which also has the bar top, tables, and smaller tables with lounge/chase chairs. It's was incredibly loud in the bar area so we chose to eat in the dinning room so we could hear each other chat but then went into the bar area for drinks after dinner.   Menu: MUST TRY THE MASHED POTATO BALLS. Omg they're unreal. it's basically a baked potato with chives and butter, mashed up, and fried into little balls served with a ranch dipping sauce and a chipotle sour cream dipping sauce. I we had them in both the dinning area and bar they were that good. The grilled cheese is served on big soft texas toast with a generous amount of fries. I ordered the western burger with the black bean patty which was tasty but i was a little disappointed the black bean patty wasn't made in house so the patty was kind of slim. And of course its served with a generous portion of fries.   Drinks: Very reasonable priced drinks and they also have happy hour! i looked a few of their house wines and the pinot noir is their best quality. I ended up ordering that and was very pleased. They also have about every flavor vodka and flavored rums as well. The bar area is very relaxed with serves in the area in addition to the bar tenders. They even offered us water bottles on our way out the door while paying our check which i feel the gesture went a long way.  Top notch in service and genuine for sure.   Bill: We split the bill, signed for my half of the bill and somehow i was still charged the full bill so i have to give them a call and get that fixed. So may just be sure you check your account before leaving the parking lot.",

We sat in the little smoke-free room (although we were dying to go sit out by the bar, but still too smokey for us, womp.) The new expanded menu was impressive! I went back to being vegetarian and my partner still eats meat. The vegetarian options here are AWESOME. I ordered the bean and cheese dip, avocado rolls, and in the past I've had the buffalo cauliflower. And my partner had the nachos and some other dish that I can't remember because I was so involved in enjoying my own food, I don't think I even looked up to see what he was eating ha. Their bar drinks are good, a little weak on the EtOH factor, but definitely tasty. Still wish they had a larger beer selection, especially of local or west coast brews. Hopefully with the changes they're making, this could be something they'll work on (please?)     Look forward to coming back here soon :)",

Crab cakes are fishy like imitation crab (expected) but without sauces not good. Husband liked his French dip though. No siracha suave or anything ruined it for me.",

On all of the previous visits, my drinks were comped including a visit earlier that day. When I came for dinner, I bought a friend. We ate dinner and when we got the check, I was charged for 1 of my 2 beers. I'm not upset that I was charged but I'm upset that I wasn't informed ahead of time that I was being charged. Inconsistency and lack of communication impacted the tip. I'm one that regularly tips above 20% but think I may have left $2-3 this visit. Great food but not sure I will continue to visit. I also went to Fireside and the food is just as good with a better beer selection which is free while playing. Gonna miss Distill because I really liked the place.",

That being said, support our local businesses, PT's, \"The evil empire\" is building restaurants on every corner, the McDonald Monopoly effect.  Literally, PT's will go into an establishment and offer the owner 50,000 cash to put their machines in.  In other words, you might not be at a PT's per say, but they have a hidden control, monopoly effect wise.  Golden gaming  owns PT's, and indirectly owns small business owners with their machines in their establishments.  All in all Distill is my home away from home!",

There was a large group of young and loud (obnoxious is more the word) guys and girls who were overly intoxicated sitting at the bar behind us and were so over the top we left after the following series of events. My boyfriend had gone to the bathroom and I was approached by one of the guys from this group not once but 3 times creepily trying to talk to me about hooking up with him. When my bf got back to the table the guy hit my head with his arm (not sure intentional or not) but when he was asked to be mindful of his surroundings the creepy guy almost started a fight with us. I've been here many times before and never had a problem and food and drinks always hit the spot. My only request is that your staff be more aware of the customers and how intoxicated they get, as well as if they are in a smaller area where they are encroaching on other guests seating area to be mindful and maybe move them to a space that fits them. We were sitting by the fireplace and we were there way before this other group came in.  Just realized this is for southern highlands location when it was meant for summerlin. I do apologize but it won't let me delete.",

We walked in and sat ourselves at a table. The bartenders saw us walk in but no one greeted us. We waited for at least 15 minutes until someone went to our table. We went here on a Sunday afternoon so it was pretty dead. We contemplated on leaving to go to another place because no one bothered to check on us.. Not even a quick greeting to tell us that someone would be with us shortly. We ended up staying and ordering food & drinks. The server was not bad, she was polite but the service was very slow.  I ordered a margarita from their speciality cocktail menu.. Probably one of the worst margaritas I've had in while. Overall, the place has potential as the inside looks good.

Until about maybe 30 mins into it when I was asked to move from a unique (1 of 2) machine at the bar so a woman (who had just won and cashed out a decent amount, I can assume at the other,) wanted to play where I was sitting. Not one for playing a a machine while my hands are dirty, due to the appetizer sampler that had arrive 5 mins prior, I was waiting to play until finished. Though my boyfriend next to me was playing his machine, and having already been asked if we were playing, I was asked to move to a different seat. Thoroughly upset I was too polite to say no and speak my mind.   Felt it appropriate to add as well the women's restroom was in poor order. One of the two stalls was not only out of paper but had toilet seat covers covering the floor of the stalls. As accidents and people happen, I would have not paid attention to this if weren't for the fact I could hear myself even speak out loud due to the loud music. I don't often mind this being in my mid 20's but really?  As good as the food was (reason for the 2nd star), and as regular as we would have become living and working just down the road, we won't be returning. Which is saddening since Molly's closed and the food was good.   Don't expect to stay in the seats you may choose or get common courtesy in this establishment unless it's from Brianna.",

I can appreciate this was to separate the smokers from the non but still a little weird layout as it really looked like i was in an aquarium by myself. The service was just ok, a little too much standing around and gossiping for me (should be done out of sight of guests). And the food is similar menu to Summerlin with basic bar food and nothing that really screams.... gotta come back for that except the dessert. Bread pudding ... YES! no raisins...YES the the 3rd power.

Used to be an Italian place which was pretty bad, Distill certainly upped the ante with the whole reclaimed wood, Edison bulb feel that seems to be the go to look for a restaurant that wants to be \"different.\" Layout is clean, good place to watch games with multitude of screens, pool tables, and an enclosed dining area.   My food experience was a bit of a letdown though. Had the fish tacos with it being rubbery and over seasoned. My wife had probably the most disappointing fish and chips ever--soggy and greasy. I mean, it's fried guys, hard to mess up. We have a theory that it sat at the pass and just drowned in its own oil. The positive was service where they recognized our displeasure and comped us the meals. I'm going to give them a pass and will try them again, chalk it up to it being new.   Anyway, they are trying. Next time I'll just sit at the bar, have drinks, and enjoy the view...rraaar.",

We found machines to gamble out right away. The bartender was friendly we ordered drinks and food. The problem is when the food came out. I got a western burger the bacon came out barley cooked it looked raw. My boyfriends food came out with a bug on it! It was dead laying on his plate in the middle of the food. It took us a couple minutes to flag down the bartender and we informed her of the meal. She grabbed the plate said eww and what do you want me to do? Grab you another one or just take it off. At this point we were so grossed out we just wanted to leave. We grabbed the bill and the food with the bug was still on there. I had to ask them to remove it. No one ever said sorry about it or a manager didn't even come talk to us. We will never return here again.",

My mapquest took me to a residential area in the middle of nowhere on W Pyle Ave.  I had to call Distill in W. Charleston to get the cross roads.  So for those looking for this local bar......South Decatur and W. Pyle Ave.  Whatever you do.....keep heading south on S. Decatur until you see Distill sign on your left.  Anyway, the service was really good.  Our waitress,Danielle was very attentive.  She made sure our glasses were full and our plates were cleared when needed.  As for the food, I really enjoyed the fried mashed potato and the grilled chicken with vegetables. The chicken was very flavorful!  The vegetable was cooked just right!    As my stress reliever drink from getting lost trying to find the bar......it was so soothing and comforting that I forgot about being stressed out!!  LOL ( I had the Cinnamon Apple Sour- Infused Orange Cinnamon Whiskey, Redd's Apple Ale and Sour.)  I enjoyed my dinner and service.  I would recommend this bar to my friends and family.  Looking forward to visiting again!",

Distill's changed that for me, though!  Minutes from where I live and a great atmosphere.  You've got a good-sized bar in the middle, some tables and lounge-type chairs along the outside walls and a couple of pool tables just outside of the separate dining room area.  I stopped by for their grand opening last week around midnight.  Missed the main crowd but it was still super busy.  Despite the volume of people I had no trouble getting up to the bar and being served in a timely manner.  Went back again today for lunch and tried the Western Bacon Burger with fries and washed it down with the Redd's Apple Ale they have on tap.  Delish!  I've only been waited on by two people so far, one of them my friend Kristina who's been serving me for close to a year now, but it seems like everybody on the staff is on top of their game, friendly and happy to work there.  That's a big plus because I've been to my share of bars in this town where there's drama going on with the employees and employers and that just kills the vibe for me.  Distill's a great place and one of my new favorite hang-out spots!",

The service was great and we had a few people check in on us as the night went on.  We ordered cocktails and a few appetizers and I was impressed!  The cocktail menu was a little different and right up my alley.  We ordered the street tacos (which were some of the best I have had in a bar type atmosphere) and the mashed potato bites (so decadent and delicious).   I'm happy!  We will definitely be back.

My friend got seats right by a tv for us.   It was a little weird because I didn't know if we were supposed to order at the bar or not since I couldn't tell if there were any workers actually waiting on tables. It took a little while for her to get to our table, but she eventually got there. Their menu is pretty big, plenty of things to choose from! I never crave burgers... ever. But I glanced at that part of the menu and was suddenly craving lol. I opted for the western bacon burger (or something like that) with sweet potato fries. & my friend ordered a (chicken?) quesadilla. We also got a couple or Jameson & ginger ales. Honestly, the burger was goooood & so were the fries. The burger was a little too drenched with bbq sauce but still very tasty! I'll probably get it with bbq sauce on the side next time or just tell em light. The fries were perfectly crispy.   Service promptness was okay but very friendly! I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.",

However, the treatment me and my guests received from the bartender was completely unacceptable. We had over 30 people there that we brought in the party. Easily spent over $700 for everything. After being there for probably four or five hours, one of the regulars began to sexually harass all of the females in the group. When one of the females stood up for herself, the regular became aggressive. At that point the bartender, instead of standing up for the females that were getting harassed, decided to tell off and cut off the female claiming that she was harassing his regular and that we needed to leave. When I came up to ask the bartender what happened and to explain to him what the regular was doing oh, she got an attitude with me. Multiple times trying to contact management and let them know what happened and just got the runaround from management. It's a shame because this place was a great place to go. But I will not give a dime of my money to a place that does not protect Women or even attempt to rectify a bad situation.",

I definitely love the menu and the consistency in quality and taste.  The pot roast spring rolls are a must! Packed with pot roast flavor and crisp pastry. I order these everytime. The Mashed Potato Bites are also amazing! I've like the Jalapeno Popper Burger. Very delicious. The cream cheese and bacon toppings are so good.  The Pot Pie is flaky and the roasted chicken and vegetables inside are delicious. Definitely up there with chicken pot pies of tried. The fish and chips are not bad. My gf likes to order them here. We never have room for dessert! We once made it 1/4 into  Bread Pudding.",

Very attentive and even brought us a lit of Sushi places that her coworkers recommended for later in the day. I originally thought they still had cheese curds on the menu, unfortunately it was an old yelp review that I had seen them on, but she talked us into getting the mozzarella sticks instead and they were just as satisfying! We ordered the gyro to share, which was so good and a salad which tasted so fresh and yummy! My 4 year old had the sliders which she gobbled up. Very awesome food and amazing service!",

It's kind of disheartening to see this and is happening more frequently now then last year. Let's keep it fair for all your patrons that come and spend money at your bar. Just happened again tonight at the Broncos/Texans game. Never heard one announcement by your female or male bartender.",

    "text": "After starting an episode of Pretty Little Liars @ 5:15 I found out HH ended at 6. So we grabbed our shoes and rush down Blue Diamond to get our HH on!!! We arrived around 5:35ish. It was a Sunday and the same playoff game was on every TV. We walked in and it was really loud, I'm going to assume it's because of the playoff game, because after it was over i could actually hear our waitress and talk to my party without yelling.  We came here as a group for bro beers. We grabbed the big chairs and put them in a circle with two tables in the middle for the apps. We started with chips and salsa and a personal pizza. The chips and salsa were a good choice nothing crazy special but it was perfect thing to keep me from ordering all the other delicious looking items. I was trying to be good. However, i tried the pizza and it was yummy. We order some HH drinks and started the night. I started with a vodka redbull. They have nice heavy glasses. We joked when it was close to 6 that our waitress was avoid us. She came back right at 6 and said she had a large party and she would add another drink for HH. NICE! After everyone showed we just chit chatting and looking around. They had some really funny signs. One of my favorite was the big D that pointed to the bathroom. hehe, I thought it was funny. After a few cranberry vodkas I had to use the bathroom, I walked in and thought I was in a club. The music is super loud in the bathroom. I just couldn't understand when it transformed into a club. After walking out of the club I noticed they have Buck Hunt!!! I am awful at the game but it's super fun. I wish i would have had some cash to play. Distill was a fun adventure that will defiantly be had again.",

Now, the food is always overlooked.  Pancakes, always dry and burnt. Ordered pancakes at least five times in the past, and always so bad.  Last hamburger bun, burnt.  Meat so over cooked and dry.  Beef tenderloin skewers, so overcooked and dry, couldn't even bite into them. In the garbage they went.  Avocado eggrolls used to be big and nice presentation.  So yummy! Again, overlooked and smaller.  Fruit bowl was slimmy. I hate writing this but come on, please have the kitchen step it up like it used to be!    What happened lately?  Also, bartenders, acknowledge a customer when they stand at the bar. I know you're busy, but at least say I'll be right with you.  And don't keep having a conversation with other customers talking about the weather, etc, when you have customers waiting.  Bad customer service!   Waitresses in dinning area are great! If the above was fixed, I'd give this place ten stars!",

The Southwest salad and bacon cheeseburger sliders are especially yummy. Nice furnishings, TV screens, and overall atmosphere.  NFL specials make games fun. Really appreciate the drinkable house cab!",

    "text": "We use to love to come here...especially on Friday nights because of their Clam Chowder....Now they add TABASCO SAUCE to the Clam Chowder (can't find one recipe that has that in their Clam Chowder recipe.  My stomach does not tolerate spicy food.  This past Friday night, we went there, and I didn't get the clam chowder, but my boyfriend did.....he said it was so spiced that he almost couldn't eat it.  I understand that some people enjoy spicy food.....but shouldn't tabasco sauce be a \"condiment\" that people can add, and not the chef altering a traditional clam chowder?    This past Friday, I went there specifically to have their Buffalo Cauliflower, but not tossed in the spicy sauce.  The pieces of cauliflower were small, the were deep fried to long to the point they were almost burnt, AND they, too, have been altered to have some type of spicy seasoning added to the breading.  I was talking to my daughter-in-law about it yesterday, and she said that the last three out of four times they went there, their food wasn't any good.  They, like us, are not sure we will continue to go there....which is a shame as we use to frequent it at least once a week.  There are other options out there, and we are probably going to take our business elsewhere.",

First football sunday of the season and it wasnt that busy. The bar seats were mostly full and there were a few tables, including ours. My first drink came out with lip marks all over the rim of the glass, and my friend's shot of jameson was watered down with the mixer... no alcohol at all. They were replaced, but then at least three of our entrees just flat out didn't come. We had to seek out the staff and ask where our food was MORE THAN ONCE in order to have it brought out to us. We were still charged for all of it. I might think again before coming to this spot.",

    "text": "Used to go here all the time couple of years ago and LOVED it. Couple of friends and I would come for casual drinks and great bar food and service was always impeccable. The good memories are probably salvaging this review to two stars to be honest because these last two trips are far from accommodating.  Came couple of days ago on a Thursday during happy hour after not being at this location in awhile. Bar wasn't particularly busy with maybe 10-12 people inside at the time. Sat at the bar and ordered a pretty standard cocktail. Bartender was very attentive at first and when it was time to order my second drink I ordered the tacos on the happy hour menu after she gave me the spiel on them. Around 30 minutes I was pretty anxious on when I would be actually receiving my food. It was around the 45 minute mark I noticed the couple next to me almost done with their food who ordered their wings about 15 minutes after me. When I asked the bartender politely if my food was on the way her response was, \"I actually forgot to put in the order but I can put it in now and not charge you.\" I assured her it was okay and don't worry about it. I didn't think too much of it and closed my bill.  Just came back from this location again maybe an hour ago on a Sunday night because my friend wanted to have a surprise birthday shindig for her boyfriend who is also a close friend of mine. Me and a friend ordered our food which consisted of me getting the shrimp stir fry and he ordered the Thai turkey wrap. Again, same bartender, around the 45 minute mark of waiting again we addressed politely when our food should be arriving. Her response was, \"it should be coming out, someone must've put it to come out at the same time.\" She was the one who put in the order, no reason to deflect the blame. The food promptly came out maybe 10-12 minutes after asking. The stir fry was okay, the vegetables seemed a bit sturdy for a stir fry. My assumption is that they maybe forgot the order and tried to hurry up the order. While we were eating our meal we weren't checked up on after to see if our food was okay, kinda seemed like they just didn't care.  Another friend from our party also ordered the buffalo cauliflower maybe an hour after we did. After waiting an hour and a half she also just decided to close out her bill without receiving her order of food. Preparing a cauliflower dish should not take over 10 minutes. The traffic for the bar wasn't anywhere near capacity.  Maybe I'll come sometime in the future but these last two visits were very disappointing.",

Our roommate had tried Distill via Postmates a few days before and raved about it, so we decided that we wanted to try it out.  The place was packed, but we were able to find a table to seat the 6 of us.   We had:   appetizers:  Mashed potato bites Fried mozzarella  BBQ Beef Empenadas  Mashed potato bites are 100% the star.  It was our favorite dish of the entire night.  Believe me, you need this in your life.  Served with a chipotle sour cream and ranch (although they are great with the BBQ sauce too), they are little bites of potato heaven.   All the apps were good, but those were definitely the best.  For entrees, we had the Cuban, which my husband said was pretty standard.  The steak tri tip platter, which was to die for, and the cajun chicken alfredo, which was good, but a little too spicy for me.    We enjoyed our visit, and definitely plan to come back for happy hour and pool!",

I think the bread pudding tasted great but it would've been better if I had it fresh versus having it delivered to my house. The fried chicken sandwich is one of the best I had. Even after being delivered and not being hot and fresh, the chicken was still very crispy. I loved the flavor of it and the flavor and heat in the spicy slaw. I still get fried chicken sandwiches in other restaurants trying to find one as delicious as the one I had here. The avocado egg rolls are delicious. They reminded me of the ones at BJs. They came with a dipping sauce that went well with the flavor. I can't wait to come back when I'm in town to try more of their menu items!",

By the time she brought us our drinks she was settling into a groove and she was able to breath a little.   The appetizers by themselves were delicious. The calamari was some of the best I have ever had. The fried grilled cheese was a flavor explosion! Such a creative dish.  The main dishes crushed my expectations. I was expecting bar food and instead I got a \"90\" Fat Boy burger that was superior to anything else in the area. It was one of those that is so good you can't stop eating, even though your gut is about to bust open. I'm looking forward to getting back to try another burger.   It might be a little out of the way and off the beaten path, but Distill is definitely worth a stop. If you like a quieter meal, head into the dining toom side. If you like some noise, the bar side will suit you well.",

    "text": "Update: how convenient of this bartender to not give receipts to the individuals of our group after they've paid. Definitely need to file a dispute somewhere to make sure this doesn't become a common occurrence!  I would have rated this place a 4 stars if it wasn't for the end where our bill was incorrect and the bartenders' (Ryan G.) response was \"that's the way it is\" just because we are the last ones to leave. We leave a tab open for ourselves (group of 5 people) not for others to charge their shit onto our card and the bartender had no right allowing people to charge onto our card or even to add items that weren't paid for because he couldn't pay attention. Did he pocket cash and we ended up responsible for the two added items, very possible. That constitutes fraud and management should keep a closer eye on this guy. If it's not this guy, then this bar is taking advantage of large isolated groups that come in and adds on items that weren't ordered to increase profit.   We ordered two sex on the beach, a pomagranite punch and a whiskey sour and ordered one water (not bottled) before shift change. Then at the end we ordered two tequila shots, somehow wings and an AMF drink were added to our tab when we decided to leave and close the tab.   I tried ordering my tequila shots earlier in the night, but Ryan was too busy showing some customers what was on his cellphone instead so I left and returned to the counter a bit later for it and to get quarters for the pool table again. I tried to hand him his tip after getting my coins, but he just turned around and walked away after handing me quarters, so it ended up being placed under the rubber mat on the counter. Kind of explains why our tab ended up incorrect because of his negligence and lack of attention or he pocketed the cash that was paid from our other group and decided to use us since we paid with credit. Make sure to keep/ask for receipts if part of your group pays cash.  AGAIN BEWARE of leaving your tab open, for the reasons above which is why I was skeptical at leaving it open in the first place, but since it wasn't busy(Monday evening) I thought we would be ok. How terribly wrong I was. How is it fair to overcharge customers because you couldn't do your job properly?  Pool tables cost $1 each game (uses quarters only or maybe it just works better with coins). We came in a little before 11pm and unfortunately I didn't get the names of the original bartender or waitress. He was great, seem to have a sense of humor from our brief encounter and waitress was good, could have been better, she seemed like she didn't want to be there and didn't seem too happy when I told her my sister was still deciding what her first legal drink should be, it had only been a few minutes since we arrived. She warmed up a bit later and was very attentive, frequently coming back to check up on us and apologized for taking long in bringing my boyfriend the water he requested. Both were definitely better at providing service than Ryan did.   Restrooms were clean, a plus. Large area to hang out and yes a bit smokey. You can smell it once you pass the first set of doors. I may or may not return to this establishment.. since our first experience here turned out like this.   I was really hoping I could come back to this place and take advantage of their loyalty program versus going to PTs/Sierra Gold or all the choices in Downtown area. But there are plenty of other bars with more games and better service around town that will gladly take their customers",

All the action was in the enclosed bar. Many people sounding drunk and a little crazy which was odd for noon on a Sunday, but hey, it's Southern Highlands right? And they were having fun. A Randomly located bar/ restaurant but seemingly clean and didn't smell of smoke. To start we had a cider and I ordered a Sams 76 which was printed on the corporately designed beverage list. \"Sorry we don't serve Sams 76\". Ergh! I had an Oktoberfest and it was cold. We ordered a Rueben sandwich and a melted cheddar cheese brisket sandwich as well as the daily soup: jalapeno corn chowder. The corn chowder was 20 minutes away from being a dip. Verrrry spicy and we couldn't finish it. The Rueben tasted like a little too much vinegar and the meat was a little tough. The brisket on the cheese sandwich was basically 'deli' meat. The bbq sauce smothered on that sandwich saved it to some extent but we would not order any of  those items again. We will try for breakfast and see.",

It's a little dark when you walk in but I like that, I don't like a well lit bar. The atmosphere was very laid back, there's a separate dining area off to the side if you don't feel like inhaling smoke the entire time.   The service was great - our server was very nice and attentive. The food was also pretty good. They have a happy hour menu with small bites and beer for good prices. We tried the chili cheese fries and we added a fried egg on top, delicious! We had the chicken dinner and a burger... The chicken dinner was a chicken breast with a creamy sauce on top with a side of potatoes and veggies. The burger wasn't cooked how I liked it (the other person likes it medium instead of medium rare) but it was good, came with fries too.   Would definitely come back for more beers and good food. Great place!",

The potatoes weren't mashed and there were potato cubes inside. The seasoning was off too. On another prior visit, the tacos were just mediocre. What happened to the food? I guess I'll just stick to drinks here. Service is still attentive or decent.",

Waited 5 minutes nothing. Called again, finally the guy that seated us came to the table.  Some excuse about Crystal being busy with 30 people. Yet he peeked out of the kitchen 3 times. Something about he thought Crystal was handling us. He took our drink order and left.  After 5 minutes we left. So sad, we heard the food was good. Service counts guys and staff needs to step up and help each other. If someone is handling like 20 people, then YOU take care of the others....",

Each time I've been here it was for breakfast, I haven't drank at the bar yet but if it is anything like its breakfast then I look forward to it. This is one of those separated eating area/bar places which is pretty cool as I don't like to inhale a plume of smoke when I eat food.   I ordered the Ham and Eggs (poached) which came with hash browns and roast. The food was delicious and the hash browns cooked just right, I was going to order pancakes with it but decided not to because I was stuffed! The portions are definitely healthy as I was satisfied.   The service was superb, she never left us alone for too long and refilled our drinks when they started to get low. The prices were very reasonable for what you get, my check was under $8 for my breakfast. The decorum was very modern and lighting matched the ambience, there is a semi-private dining are off to the side that was suitable for my group.   If your in the area and looking for a reasonable good breakfast spot this is it, I'll have to check out the bar one of these days and see if it pairs up with its dining room service.",

Definitely looking forward to industry Wednesdays after 10PM, awesome food and drink specials with your industry ID. Favorite thing on the menu: Avocado Egg Rolls $7.99, Mashed Potato Bites are good too. Yum! Of course they are still working out some kinks, and I'm not super crazy about their beer selection, but I will hopefully be able to update to 5 stars soon. Yay for a new local bar!",

I've been there all different times of the day and always get exceptional service.  I like to come and gamble, eat, and have a few cocktails. I haven't had the best of luck on the machines but that's nobody's fault. The machines are always clean with a great selection of games and bonus money you earn playing with a card.  The food is unbelievable considering it's just a neighborhood bar in the middle of the desert. On top of a top notch menu they run specials daily and have an awesome happy hour.  Without a doubt my favorite bar in the city of sin! If you don't know now you know!",

    "text": "If you live on the southwest side of Vegas (Southern Highlands or Mountains Edge area), this bar is tucked away in a corner off Decatur and Pyle. But worth the find!  My friend Olivia introduced me to Distill a few months ago. We started coming here after work to de-stress, eat and have a few drinks. There are two parts to this place: there's the actual bar, which takes up most of the space here. Large TVs for sports, tons of tables to sit at, the entrance is the main entrance at the front of the establishment. The second part is the actual sit-down, restaurant section. It's separate from the smokiness and loudness of the bar area. And much more intimate. I prefer to sit here. And the entrance is off to the side.   Seating is by choice. We usually love to grab an open booth. Happy hour is from 3pm to 7pm! My roomie ordered the chicken lettuce wraps off the happy hour menu. And my goodness. I honestly think those were THE BEST lettuce chicken wraps I've had in Vegas. The chicken was shredded and so juicy. I couldn't take a pic because I was way too hungry, unfortunately. I ordered a side of sweet potato fries - which were nothing short of amazing - and a whiskey ginger ale off the happy hour menu for $3! My coworker ordered a BLT and she seemed very pleased with her food. But then again, I've seen her order multiple items here and she seemed to thoroughly enjoy the others as well.  Please order the chicken lettuce wraps, even if you don't make it in for happy hour.   And ask your server for a loyalty card! It gives you points on all your future visits and access to their other bar properties around the Vegas area.",

She recommended some turkey waffles. I have never heard of such a contraption. But the way she described the succulent Turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry, gravy, and syrup topped on a breakfast waffle had my mouth watering.  I didn't need a menu. I ordered before she was even done explaining what it was. This is Thanksgiving on a waffle the week before Thanksgiving. This was the best invention at the best bar in town. Thanks Nicole!",

Now how that's even possible is beyond me (someone isn't washing their hands who's preparing the food or not washing the vegetables properly). 2 hours after eating this, I became VERY SICK and began puking. Classic food poisoning. Generally this is my favorite veggie burger, but I usually go to the summerlin location to get it....this was my first time having it delivered and it came from this location. Again, when food poisoning comes from vegetables there's a clear lack of washing.....gross. WASH YOUR HANDS AND WASH YOUR VEGETABLES! What restaurant gives customers food poisoning from vegetarian food?! Disgusting, I can't even imagine what the meat products do. In fact, maybe management should check out that entire kitchen or the health department because again FOOD POISONING FROM VEGETABLES ISNT NORMAL. Avoid this location unless you want to be sick.",

The bartender Ryan was quite possibly the worst we've seen in any local Vegas bar. An order of a Cosmo on the rocks was delivered appearing as pink lemonade from the \"gun\". When he was informed that it wasn't satisfactory, the attitude began. Attentiveness was abandoned and it was as if we were 4 customers with an incurable disease. Another drink was ordered and we were \"informed\" if we didn't like \"this drink\" we'd have to PAY for it, as if we couldn't scratch two nickels together. All in all, we won't be returning.  Ryan, Sir, don't get so butthurt when someone says they don't like how you made a drink.  You surely missed out on good money from us. Cheers.",

    "text": "You'll need a compass and Dora the Explora's map to find this place, but it's worth the trip.   Distill is definitely going for that 30 something crowd with its old school video games and \"loungey\" vibe. This is enhanced with multiple large cozy chairs and soft couches lining one side of the bar. To quote my GF, \"it didn't feel like a sleazy Vegas bar\". This is True, the sleaze factor in here is low, but so is the excitement level...which isn't a bad thing. Sometimes you just wanna sit in a dimly lit location, drink a few craft cocktails, and just chill with friends.   The decor is modern influenced with giant letters, canvas \"paintings\" and random light bulbs on the walls that you're starting to see everywhere. Distill is also very clean, which sadly can be a troublesome thing to find with most local bars in the Valley. The staff here are super attentive and make sure you've always have something in your hand; my glass was never empty for more than a minute. I was going to give this place a 3 star rating, but the food won me over and welcomed that coveted extra star.   I'm not a big carb lover, but this place got me right in the feels; fried Mashed Potato Bites and Mini Soft Pretzel Bits, yowza! These might have had meth in them cause I just couldn't stop eating; then I found myself getting fired up when finished them. My food anger only subsided when the Seared Mahi and Carne Street Tacos were placed in front me. These were good, but I definitely have had better seared fish and street tacos. Trust me go with the Mashed Potato Bites you won't be disappointed!  If your not hungry try the \"Distiller's Delight\", a very good and refreshing drink for a whiskey based cocktail. It has Bulleit Whiskey, orange bitters, Sprite, and some other tasty items. Very good in my whiskey drinking book. Great especially after a long day in the Vegas heat.   Distill is a great spot for a laid back weekday night cap or for the upcoming football season. They have copious amounts of TVs. Party on dudes!",

The best thing on the menu that I end up craving is the happy hour fried artichoke hearts. I also enjoy the rueben. I can only give it 3 stars even though I eat here often. As other reviewers have mentioned the level of service quality depends heavily on the staff that is working that evening. Some of the staff are excellent and some are not. Also the food can be somewhat hit and miss.   My wife and I agree that the salads are all very basic and not worth the money however I will reiterate that some of the more savory dishes are excellent. I love the Cure burger as well.",

I come here with friends quite frequently to enjoy a few beers, play video poker, and share some pretzel bites (you have to try, they are the most addicting little nuggets - they come with the cheesiest cheese and a horseradish honey mustard). Distill is also a good spot to watch games, although it can get pretty packed like most bars.   Patrick and Mo are two of the bartenders we see a lot and they are great! Quick and readily available if we need anything. They engage with us too which always adds to our positive experiences here and are also why we enjoy coming back.   Would definitely recommend checking out Distill if you want to grab drinks and appetizers, bar food, or even dinner with friends.",

The service here is always on point no matter what time of day.  As far as food?  I've had a chicken wrap and built my own breakfast burrito in the middle of the day!  I love that.  Breakfast anytime is always a plus in my book.  TV's are all over the place, and you can definitely get whatever game you like on at any time.  Well over twenty beers on tap, Red Bull, crown apple and the latest and greatest.  The only downfall here is that sometimes they are too packed and if you like to gamble, it can be a bit hard.  But other than that, I typically never have anything negative to say about anyone or anything here.  Out in the middle of nowhere in southern highlands, so it's not hard to miss!  Check them out!",

I ordered the steak with demi-glaze that came with a medley of roasted potatoes (red, purple & sweet potatoes) and grilled asparagus. I ordered the steak medium rare & it came medium. I had to send it back. The second steak came back a True medium rare. The steak was \"tough\" though...like from it being frozen too long & then defrosted days prior to cooking. It did not have that \"fresh meat\" taste. The demi-glaze was a little too salty & the asparagus looked & tasted like they had been frozen & not fresh prior to cooking as well. I was disappointed. On the bright side: the potato medley was good as well as the side Caesar salad. Stick with the traditional bar foods & skip the entrees. Also, stay away from the ahi tuna...does not taste fresh & has a metallic fishy aftertaste. I have ordered it twice & experienced the same problem.",

Chicken fried steak and the 90s fatboy burger were good but after I had the burger I got insanely sick. I feel like there was a poor preparation of the meat and mishandling of the avocado in the burger. I don't know if I would consider going back if they don't know how to properly cook and prepare food",

The last time I was here was probably about four months ago. I was here with my girl friend and it took 20 mins to get a greeting and finally took our drink order. Then it took another 20 mins to just get a menu. And they weren't that busy and there was three bartenders and two servers working that night.   But since then I've had a wonderful experience here and will come here more often now!",

Came with ranch and another dipping sauce with chipotle base (I'm guessing).  Also, I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla which was blissfully delicious!  The combination of flavors included a little spice , pico de Gallo, cheeses some herbs and a whole lot of taste! I will frequent the place and enjoy the ambiance of a locals bar, friendly welcome of the bartender Elliot, and the quality of good food at great happy hour prices!",

Our food arrived after about 40 minutes.  They completely forgot one of our group members order and they charged an extra 1.50 to someone who ordered extra gravy. Despite everything we went through the servers did not so much as demonstrate a hint of empathy. They didn't seem to care at all. That was the worst part if it. I am not exagerating. I definitely will not be going back.",

    "text": "So we are local Southern Highlands residents since 2001 and we were excited to see Distill open up.  A new bar and restaurant so close to home. So the good news...great sports bar.   Cold beer, great setup, nice servers, clean, open and airy!  Perfect local hangout.   The bad news. ..The food is HORRIBLE...ordered pretzel bites and medium wings.  Pretzel bites were clearly frozen and reheated, gloppy poor excuse for cheddar cheese and a disgusting \"homemade\" beer mustard that was a soupy gross mess...sent that back.  Wings were ok...sauce was a little too vinegary.   Ordered avocado egg rolls at Servers recommendation. ..bad idea...it was a wonton wrapper filled with guacamole. ..looked gross...kinda like baby poop in a wonton wrapper.  Had zero texture and was just gross.  So we will be back for beer and cocktails..only.  Sadly I feel like they could have done better.",

    "text": "After reading some of the mixed reviews we decided to check out Distill for ourselves. Things started out great but quickly went downhill. First off the place is nice with a huge bar area and lots of TV screens. We sat in the restaurant area during happy hour and started with the Mashed Potato bites-and they were great, had a couple of HH beers and wells drinks to go with our food. We all got different sliders with sweet potato fires. One of the fries was very dark and the others which looked freshly made were hot but loaded with salt. The sliders could have been made out of cardboard as we never tasted anything so dry. The chicken cordon blu sliders was a chicken tender topped with the driest ham ever. We could barely eat any of them and decided to take them home to the dog and see if he could choke them down. Our waitress disappeared after we got our food and we sat for at least 10 minutes before we asked another waitress for to-go boxes.  When the bill came it was wrong-our HH drinks were at full price, when she came back with a \"corrected\" bill it had some of the drinks corrected but added another at full price. Not wanting to waste anymore time  waiting for a correct bill,we deducted the overcharge from our bill out of the waitress's tip and left.",
