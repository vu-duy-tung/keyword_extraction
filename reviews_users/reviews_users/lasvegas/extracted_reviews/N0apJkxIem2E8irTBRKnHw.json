    "text": "We ate here for dinner this past Monday night while I was in Vegas for a conference.  This is a cool, contemporary restaurant located inside MGM Grand.  I've eaten here several time before, but this is my first official review of this place.  Every other time I've been here, I've really enjoyed it, and this time was no exception.  We had a free appetizer for their blue cheese truffle potato chips.  YUM!  I would highly recommend these if you eat here.  They give you bread as well, so I was a little full when our meals came.  I ordered the gnocchi pasta with a sausage/marinara sauce.  It was outstanding.  My wife even admitted that she liked it better than her dish.  She ordered a ravioli dish that she wasn't particularly fond of, as she thought the pasta was a bit underdone.  Not inedible, just not exactly what she was hoping for.   They had some great looking desserts available (Red Velvet Cake), but we were so full that we couldn't partake.  Our server was very good throughout the meal, and the other helpers were quick to help with refills.  This place was 5 star for me, but fell short of that for my wife, so we'll go with 4 stars.  We were able to get out of here for about $70, including the tip, which isn't bad when you consider the fact that it's a Wolgang Puck restaurant.  I'll definitely come back here if I'm in the area.",

I honestly don't think I've had gnocchi that good.... ever.  Also, the prices were more reasonable than some of the other options, because if they weren't, trust me, we wouldn't have ended up eating there :)",

    "text": "My first experience was horrible but I ended up leaving with a smile. My entree came first and the appetizers took foreeeeever and it was nowhere to be seen after the entree was long done. It was to the point that the manager came to apologize and offer a complimentary chocolate souffle cake (or was it choco mouse?) and asked whether I still want the appetizers as they were done and ready. I was pissed but a little forgivng for expressing his apology so I kept them. When came the bill, he did not charge us for the late appetizers. YAY. As you can see, I was willing to give them a second chance and become a loyal customer. I love to eat here whenever I am in Vegas.  This is an open restaurant where you can eat and people watching at the same time if you don't mind the noise from the casino. The food and service are great, and ambience is lively, modern, and welcoming. I ordered mostly appetizers and nothing that I didn't like. To die for is the Truffle Potato Chips with Blue Cheese, all I can say is WOW. I also like Spaghettini; it's not your traditional spaghetti bursting with tomatoe sauce and grounded meat but it's a light vegetarian dish flavor right with a few key ingredients.",

I had one of the sides replaced with creamed spinach...  Which is supposed to be spinach with a little butter and cream.  Not butter and cream with a little spinach.  The food in general was so unnecessarily heavy, the creamed spinach was inedible.  The staff was very nice.",

I went because it was planned for me, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The food and atmosphere was pretty great, and the entire group I was with gave their cocktails a big thumbs up. I particularly liked the prosciutto and burrata salad. The duck on someone else's plate looked quite tempting and well-prepared, and the spinach I snagged off of someone's plate was some of the best I have had in a restaurant.",

It's an open restaurant on the casino floor and is easy to find. Service was quick and attentive which is always good, especially when four of your dining companions had been awake since 3 am EST and were dying for food.  We shared the truffled potato chips with Maytag blue cheese as an appetizer which were heavenly. For lunch, I had the caesar salad which was really good, especially because it came with a piece of bruschetta. The pizzas are big enough to share between two people, which is what two of my friends did. They actually got a half tomato, basil, and mozzarella and half pepperoni - needless to say every bite was eaten. The other big hit at the table were the ricotta gnocchi which everyone who tasted them enjoyed.  Prices are very reasonable; food was good; and overall it has a good atmosphere for a nice, casual lunch if you are at or near the MGM Grand.",

    "text": "Finally, a nice place in Vegas that you can get an affordable meal without compromising the environment!!! I love food, but I don't have the budget to splurge on every meal while I'm on Vegas. But at the same time, I don't want to eat Denny's the whole time either. I stumbled upon this place and couldn't be happier. The environment and decor of this place makes you feel like you are in Vegas, not at some cheapo place.   The entrees range from about $12-25, but the \"cheap\" part of it is the pizzas. A pizza is large enough for 2 people to share and they are only $12-15 each! But if you have a big appetite, you can get your own pizza and it's still a pretty good deal. I got the chicken, eggplant, cilantro, and pepper pizza. My boyfriend got the Italian sausage, pepperoni, and tomato pizza. Both were very fresh and served hot.   We also ordered dessert--chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream. It was light in texture but rich in flavor! My boyfriend ordered a Dos Equis on draft and it was $9.   The decor is pretty trendy and the restaurant is right in the middle of the casino. The only downside of this is you get a lot of second hand smoke from the casino. Our waiter was very quick and attentive. Overall, I'd recommend this place if you are looking for an affordable but nice meal.",

Came here at 11:30am thinking we could get brunch but was told their Brunch hoes are 10pm-6am. I forget Vegas time is different. GG. So good place for that post clubbing munchies.  On the recommendation of our hostess we ordered the Truffle Potato chips with Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce. I liked the blue cheese sauce but it drowned out the truffle. Still pretty delicious especially if you like blue cheese. Which I definitely do.   Entrees:  Ricotta Agnolotti, Italian Sausage, Broccolini, Sweet Peppers, Pecorino - The golden butter sauce for this dish went well with the vegetables but it didn't quite mesh well with the ricotta agnolotti.   Handcut Papardelle, Braised Shortrib Ragu, Crimini Mushrooms, Pargmigiano - Ordered on the suggestion of our server. Very similar to a stroganoff. I recommend this dish if you're looking for something flavorful.   Prosciutto, San Marzano Tomatoes, Goat Cheese, Mozzarella, Wild Arugula - Classic artisan pizza combo. Proscuitto was thicker than usually and made the pizza taste on the salty side. I wish there was a bit more tomatoes and arugula to balance it out.   Service: The staff seemed trained in fine dining style. For example when they pour water, they'll hold a cloth napkin around it to prevent splashing. It was the little things that made me feel like I was in a fine dining expensive restaurant.",

If you want a quick bite that is not fast food with waiter service, this is your place.  Don't go in expecting gourmet food because Wolfgang Puck's name is on the menu because you won't get it here.  You will get a decent meal at a decent price with good drinks.",

Conveniently located inside the MGM Grand. The food is always amazing. Never a bad meal. Service is also excellent. Way above average.  The first time we came here I had the ribeye steak and it was the best I had ever had. Since then we have eaten it all. My wife loves Mac n Cheese and says this is the best anywhere. The Chinois Chinese Chicken Salad....also amazing. As are the chicken and steak skewers, pork chops, Jidori chicken, etc., etc.  It is all good. This last week we were in Las Vegas for 5 days and had dinner here 3 times. Kinda crazy but we don't seem to be able to get enough.",

My 4 year wasted the cheese pizza (his favorite) couldn't understand why till I tasted it and was like yeah it's not great!   2) Drinks: Mixed reviews..... Margarita strong and tasted ok. Cranberry Mojito was yummy tasting but pretty weak.   3) Entrees: 2 of us ordered the burger and were told it was amazing! NOPE! No flavor asked for BBQ sauce or Thousand Island to spruce it up and was told they were out of both! Had to settle for ketchup and mustard! One person ordered the chicken wings. (Appetizer as a meal) Those were actually pretty good!   4) Desserts: These won me over and actually get 2 of the 3 stars. We had chocolate chip cookies, creme brulee, and key lime pie.   5) Service: Waiter was ok but we noticed we weren't offered anything like other tables and felt if it wasn't for the young man that kept replenishing our drinks we would have been forgotten. We weren't offered bread like other tables. We were brought the check and we politely asked \"Do you have dessert?\" as he is handing us the check. It was like he was trying to get us in and out but they weren't busy at all. Plenty of empty tables and no one waiting.   Overall: Not impressed for the price!",

We actually dined here twice since we were staying at MGM Grand, so I got a fair sampling of the menu. Your eyes will go wide from the ridiculous prices listed: $18 pizzas, $25 pastas, $16 appetizers! $8 sides? (are we in a steak house?!) Holy toledo!   But before your wallet has a heart attack, you can be assured that you'll get your money's worth! The portion sizes are meant for sharing.  Both times I ended up boxing up leftovers ... which usually never happens.  Blueberry pancakes with vanilla marscapone cream.  BBQ chicken pizza. Crabcakes. Wild mushroom agnolotti. The Brussels sprouts are insanely good! (yes! I went crazy for vegetables!) Apple pie. Banana toffee chocolate pie.   The Aviation cocktail needs work, it had way too much creme de Violette and not enough gin! save your $15 for the penny slots.  I love that this place is open past 4 am so I can indulge on late night eats!",

It took them while or needed to ask for it again couple of times with different waiter.  Second.. Our orders took too long..  We waited more than 30 min for our foods. It seems like their foods are saltier than any other restaurants that i have been to.. Calamari (too salty). Fettuccini (olive garden is way better). Spaghetti (very salty and has strange bitter taste that I can't really explain). Steak (outer part of the steak was okay but inner part had that old meat smell..). Overall... Bad food bad service... I do not recommend this place..",

We ordered the herb crusted salmon, house made wild mushroom ravioli, grilled burger and half jidori chicken and everyone enjoyed their personal dishes. I had the salmon and it was cooked and seasoned well. The bread basket was also good. The service was a little slow at first but ultimately we were well taken care of. I had a glass of the Beringer Cabernet which was also good. They also have a larger bar with tvs and full service for those people who want to dine a little more casual. I would suggest they update their online menu as the dessert menu is completely different from what I had seen and wanted to order.",

Super attentive. My water was constantly being refilled and whenever we asked for anything it was there within seconds.   I ordered the prime burger and it was amazing. The meat was primo and cooked perfectly.   The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars was because the host podium was poorly organized and became over-crowded.   But definitely would come here again and would absolutely recommend !",

The menu was limited for non-meat eaters.  The service was ok. I ordered a $15 glass of wine and was not offered a taste, nor did they present the bottle at the table. That's a MAJOR NO NO for me.  We ordered the homemade chips with blue cheese. They were okay, nothing to write home about.  My husband had the burger, which again was just okay. I ordered the ravioli which was good, but very small portion.  Overall, I would probably try something else of in Vegas again. Wasn't my fave.",

    "text": "After walking all the way down to Mandalay Bay late one night we looked for a non-fast food place close to our hotel (Monte Carlo) with at least average reviews. We luckily saw Wolfgang Puck Express was open late and inside the MGM, so very close. The restaurant is open to casino, and this particular casino smells heavily of air freshener. I know they don't want it to smell bad or like smoke, but I think they got a little to happy with the air freshener spray, lol.  At 2:00am there were hardly any other guests here so we were easily able to get the servers attention when we needed anything. I must say, service here was superb. Much to our surprise because it was 2:00am!! The staff is very friendly and accommodating to the guests. They really know how to make you feel welcome and that they are there to serve you.   I order the Chicken Salad Sandwich. The sandwich is served in what seemed like cinnamon raisin bread with a salad on the side. The salad certainly tasted fresh/clean. The sandwich was a little different tasting at first, but after a few tastes I quickly hooked. I guess I wasn't expecting the bread to be somewhat sweet. There are also grapes inside the sandwich. So a lot of flavors here that took me a few bites to get used to. But in the end I loved the dish, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone dining here.  Excellent food, attentive and friendly service. Great experience!!",

    "text": "While almost all of my reviews are planned ahead of time through my always growing to-do list, every once in a while I end up at a random restaurant with clients and the chance to try a random burger. Such is the case with Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, which is where I ended up at recently. Historically this scenario ends in disaster; I hate succumbing to peer pressure and ordering the default burger on some menu because I'm the 'burger guy' and everyone wants to watch me eat one, but in this case it actually turned out fairly well.  Located in the back corner of the casino near the Cirque theater and Robuchon, Puck is a large space that's very open to the loud surrounding casino. A minimal railing and some decorative elements define the perimeter of the restaurant, but it's mostly open to the slots and bright lights of everything around it. Picture your typical casino cafe setting filled with tourists and conventioneers. There are both lunch and dinner menus available depending on the time of day, and it seems like they are almost identical with maybe a few less items on the dinner menu. They both feature soups, salads, apps, pizzas and many main courses. Both also offer the Grilled Prime Burger with Vermont cheddar, smoked onion marmalade and fries, and that's exactly what I was pressured into ordering.  The bun was a bit too thick and dry, but acceptable with prominent poppy seed and onion flavors. It kind of reminded me of the bun I had at BurGR recently, but not as well proportioned; the bun to meat ratio was off as I had a good crescent shape of bun left over at the end. The meat was cooked a little more than medium rare, but seasoned well and had a good fresh beefy flavor. There was a bit too small of a topping of an almost cole slaw with shredded lettuce and onions on top, and two small tomatoes. The cheddar was melted well, but didn't stand out too much. The star and prominent flavor was the onion marmalade, both during and after my meal; it was sweet and had a good strong onion flavor. This was a very messy burger between the marmalade, mayo below and slaw juices, but overall way better than I anticipated.  The fries were also decent; your typical skinny variety cooked well with some skins and no oily flavor. This is both surprising and sad, as some strict burger joints I go to can't even get fries right these days. All of my pleasant surprises aside, I do have a major problem with the $17 price tag for this burger. Given the fact that most of the main courses on the lunch menu range from $20-39 a $17 burger seems ok, but I would counter with the argument that all of these prices are far too high and this is once again a case of a Strip restaurant taking advantage of the convention/tourist crowd while utilizing the name of a famous chef. So while this was admittedly a good burger, I wouldn't send you specifically to the MGM Grand to try it unless you already happened to be there and don't mind overpaying for it. Plus, with Mina's new 1842 about to open including hopefully a far superior burger, there will be better alternates on site.",

    "text": "This was our second visit to Wolfgang Puck's restaurant in the MGM.  The restaurant itself has a great upbeat modern decor, but being in the MGM with no walls or deliniation to speak of, there can be a bit of noise & commotion from the gaming floor from time to time.    After getting of the plane, losing a piece of luggage, etc -- it was great to sit down with a bottle of wine & the Maytag Blue cheese Truffle Oil Potato Chips to relax.  They are such comfort food!  We also shared a mushroom & leek pizza, with a great olive oil crust, with just enough garlic too.  It's a thin crust, that does have some give and toothiness to make it yummy.  WP's did have a winter tasting menu (their prix fixe option) -- and there were several nice choices, we just didn't want that much food.  But, for dinner, it may be a nice option for you.  Wait staff was fine -- waiter was pleasant to talk with, yet not too chatty.  Wine selection was nice -- went with an Irony Pinot Noir on the lower price end -- but it was fine after our day.  Total bill was $66 pre-tip.  If you're staying at the MGM, its a great place for a delicious meal.  Note -- they are also having a late menu - 11 pm to 5 am - so, gives you a much better option than MGM's Studio Cafe.",

A friend ordered the calamari and it was utterly flavorless. For a main, I ordered a pizza. I was expecting a WG wood fired pizza to be amazing. Instead, it was simply average. I'd asked for it to be a bit crispy, and if anything, it was soggy in the middle. The wolfgang puck Sauvignon blanc was too sweet for my liking.

We ordered the \"Tempura Battered Fish\". It was not tempura battered, definitely beer battered. Also, the fish was so small and the batter so much that I felt like I was eating batter only plus it was greasy.

The crust was a bland white dough, void of any flavor.  The salads were the same.  You would expect at least the \"Caesar Salad\" to be vibrant with flavor, but it was not.    To reiterate, everything was good, but not great.  We expected more of Wolfgang Puck.  What made this restaurant a standout was the great service of the staff.  They were all excellent.",

We sat down and were pleasantly surprised by a rather ecclectic menu for so late.  The hottie got the BLT and I got a stack of pancakes.  The BLT was da bomb!  It was so good I wanted to go back the next day just to order it again.  Instead of the flimsy little bacon you usually get, Wolfgang gives you a large thick piece of pork belly.  Sooooo good with a nice amount of flavorful pork fat and smokey meat.  Crispy toast and also some avacado for creaminess.  One of the best things I've ever eaten.  Oh..... well as you can see I ate most of the hottie's BLT so she ended up with most of my pancakes.  The pancakes were nothing special but they did give you a nice heap of blue berries and a great vanilla mascarpone that acted as the butter.    I would go back again and again just for the BLT.  Next time I want to try some of the pizzas.",

The pros, calamari appetizer was excellent, lightly breaded and not at all greasy or tough. And we didn't have to wait to be seated at all. Now for the cons, my pepperoni pizza was super doughy and swimming in grease...not exactly what I had in mind for a 22 dollar pizza, Vegas or not. My husband enjoyed his fried chicken sandwich but really, how hard is that to make? My daughters chicken tenders looked exactly like what you'd get at Dairy Queen, no joke. I guess I just expected more considering this is a Wolfgang puck establishment? I wish I had caught our servers name but she was practically nonexistent so that was near impossible. I had to ask twice for my water to be refilled and the wait time for everything we got was long...I definitely won't be giving this place another shot, especially considering how many amazing restaurants are within walking distance from mgm.",

    "text": "Exterior = 5/5 Located inside of the MGM Grand right next to the KA theater. We looked everywhere for it and it took some time to locate it. Looked nice and clean on the outside, wasn't many loiters when we went for dinner.  Interior = 5/5 Clean and a little small but it was nice. The noise level was okay considering the casino was right outside our seating area. It does get louder closer to and at the end of KA shows.  Service = 5/5 Very prompt. They constantly came by to check if we had full water or if we needed anything additional.  Order = 5/5 Truffled potato chips: the chips had a nice crunch and the truffle was yummy. My boyfriend was not a big fan of the bleu cheese since it overpowered the truffle a bit. It is also messy so have your napkins at the ready.  Ginger lime ice tea: was refreshing with the ginger and lime combination. Balanced out our meal.  Moscow mule: they served it in a old fashioned looking cup so I thought that was cool. It was good, the lime was strong which I liked. Wasn't too strong on the alcohol, but you can always go get drinks on the casino floor if you are looking for more alcohol.  Jidori chicken: the chicken was soft and not dried out, which is why I don't generally like to eat chicken. It had a nice crisp on the skin when you bit into it. You have to make sure you eat each chicken bite with a scoop of potatoes and their rosemary jus sauce. I was so sad when I ran out of potatoes to go with my chicken so maybe they should add more potatoes haha.   Prosciutto pizza: my boyfriend loved this, it was very simple. The arugula complimented the prosciutto and you can taste the flavors within the pizza. I was getting full from the chicken that I didn't eat too much of the pizza. However it tasted good even after we took it home for leftovers.  Price = 5/5  We were satisfied with the price we paid considering it was Wolfgang Puck and in Vegas. Definitely more enjoyable than the in house buffet this time around  Overall = 5/5  Hint = Go after a show starts, it will be relatively empty. If you go right when a show gets out it is super packed. Also when they ask if you want bottled or tap, the bottled is not free but super better tasting than tap.",

A simple skirt steak and some sauteed beans. 52 minutes and the steak was almost raw. Hardly a case of an over complicated order.

We had a group of 7, and went to Wolfgang 6 times within a week, just for the pizza :)  Price wise they're also very reasonable for the quality.  Downside: anything else but pizza is disappointing. The butternut Pasta is very tasty but it's such a small portion that you'll be hungry and will need a second entree. The salads are also disappointing: feel like the lettuce was just washed and put straight on the plate, with 2 cherry tomatoes cut in half, for $18.",

Although it was a bit of a wait to get our order in, the food was amazing. The Big Eye Tuna Tartar was fresh and the Sesame wonton chips were a great combo with the tuna Tartar. There was a layer of fresh creamy avocado on top. Absolutely divine!  For our mains, we ordered the linguine and a curry fish special. Both were absolutely delicious as well.

I of course got the vegetarian ravioli (was a corn stuffed pasta) was iffy on ordering it at first but it was very tasty and flavorful. I'd definitely come back here again.

    "text": "Came here for a super late night meal with the hubs after the KA show @ the MGM Grand. Located adjacent to KA Theatre.   We went with a chopped salad and the nightly special of a 19-oz bone-in ribeye with roasted potatoes and broccolini.   I mentioned that we were sharing and the waiter/kitchen was so kind to have split the salad for us (I guess they didn't want to clean my mess haha!).   The had the dressing on the side for the salad to keep our late-night dinner somewhat light. The chopped salad was refreshing. A mix of baby butter lettuce and spring mix, cherry tomatoes, haricots, garlicky crotons, black olives and topped with freshly grated Parmesan.   Then the entree arrived. MAN! The ribeye was beautiful. Topped with a red-wine reduction. The steak was cooked perfectly- ask for medium-rare +.   Otherwise you aren't eating it the right way!  Nicely seasoned and perfectly seared on the outside. Lots of cracked peppercorns which I like.   The meat was tender and juicy. Medium-Rare + gives the center a nice red-pink. Not too bloody and definitely not overly medium where it gets too tough. The both of use were silent as we ate. Just savoring the meat lol! The hubs was using the meat juices that had mixed with the wine reduction as additional sauce for each slice of meat..nothing left on the plate it was that good.   I think had it not been such a nice restaurant, one of us would be gnawing on the bone!  Service was excellent very attentive by our waiter and the other wait staff. Our water never went empty.   The dishes on our neighboring tables all looked amazing. Someone had the Seared salmon with quinoa and the double-cut pork-chop with whipped potatoes. I was a little jealous, but not really!    Highly recommend stopping by for a bite.",

My 12 year old niece can make better than this   Fried calamari, taste not bad bcuz of the sauce. Without the sauce will be tasteless.   Mushroom pizza, Bloody damn salty and watery. It's not from cheese it's from inside. Felt like I was they were serving frozen pizza. $18 mushroom pizza, I had to return it bcuz it was damn salty  I ordered Italian pizza, which is I had to wait but it's okay. As soon as pizza arrived,  First pizza was burnt underneath the pizza n over cooked. I had to cut it with the knife to get a slice. Second, as soon as I pull out the slice of pizza, all the topping n cheese fall off from the pizza, only left with burnt pizza dough.  Third, I had to cut pizza with hand, it rips pizza like it does not look like a pizza.   I spoke with the manager (Asian person), his cool. I felt bad for telling him. Return the pizza twice. I love pizza but this was the bad pizza I have had.   Food is zero quality Ppl, they are cool.  I would give them 2 or 3 star range but yelp is all about food and venue, I would rate them 2 stars  They need to change the menu or change the chef And make every fresh from scratch.  Manager comp all the food. I was expecting that but will left tip for the server. $26 tips.   Bad part, I had to run to restroom after bcuz my stomach was hurting",

We started with the waiters suggestion of the crab cakes and they were sooooo good. Great suggestion my friend.   My BF had the ribeye and it was cooked to perfection. It was super good. The potatoes were amazing. They were small potatoes I think and deep fried but had this scrumptous feeling when you bit into it. It was like an airy potatoe. There had to be some type of coating to get it like that. But it was soo good!  I had the spaghetti and meatballs. It was okay but a little too spicy for me so I couldn't get the full marinara flavoring. The meatballs were huge though. But I'd have to get something else next time.  Drinks were always filled, plates always cleared. I love great customer service. I would suggest this place if you're looking for good food and good service.",

    "text": "Wow...the best 3 AM mac 'n cheese I've ever eaten. REALLY it was 4 AM, since the clocks had just been switched back that night. I had announced that I NEEDED to find some mac 'n cheese, and ohhh how grateful I was when Wolfgang Puck's appeared as we turned the corner. So can you trust my 4 AM-in-Vegas mac 'n cheese testimonial? Absolutely! That was some damn good macaroni and four cheeses. Hot, creamy, and salty...and tucked into the perfect little cast iron pot to safely house some 1500 or so calories. Exactly what I had wanted.  And then there was the, \"I just want something small\" - famous last words of a man. My husband ordered a wood oven pizza with prosciutto, Kalamata olives, oven dried tomatoes, basil pesto, and goat cheese. After unattractively housing my dish, I tried a piece of the pizza (sans crust - tummy was starting to protest), which was fantastic. Kalamata olives blow me away every time I eat them on a pizza or flatbread. Just delicious. My husband apparently agreed; he ate all but two slices of the rest...and then we went upstairs to our room and he ate those two. Gross, but not really...it WAS that good.  We were in and out pretty quickly and all cravings were satisfied! Definitely loved it. And I have no doubt that the place is incredible for lunch, dinner, and the like...but for now, I will remember it so fondly as the late-night keeper of the mac 'n cheese. Yummmm.",

He suggested desserts for us that were off the charts good. We had the chicken and the sea bass both very delicious.  We sampled the peach cobbler, creme brulee and the beignets all equally delicious  (hard to believe we were  just going to have a few appetizers but it was so good we stuffed ourselves. My daughter asked for a Dr. Pepper they didn't even mention that they don't serve Dr. Pepper they just sent someone to run and get some for her. Now that's what I call service! Also one of the head guys, I think his name was Kane , was amazing stopped by several times to make sure we were taken care of and to admire the baby. So enjoyable.

My salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. I hate when a salad is over dressed. I did get chicken breast to go with my salad and it was a bit overseasoned to the point of being too salty.   All in all, this was a fun restaurant and a good dining experience but just remember, you're paying casino floor prices..so don't get sticker shock when the bill arrives.",

Best group of people I have met in all of Vegas. Even of the food was bad ( and it is really excellent) the staff would make it a great experience.   Speaking of food, everything from the pizza to sandwiches to drinks were first class. We ate there every day for a week and were not disappointed with any choice.   Once we split a Ruben and the plates came with a full helping of the side of potato salad on each plate. They also do half portions of the soups which is a great option.   We recommend this Puck outpost without hesitation.",

We were staying at the MGM hotel and after coming back from Fremont street we decided to go back to the hotel, do some gambling and have a slow night. But first, we were hungry so I found great reviews about this place on yelp and it was on my hotel. Kaaaaching!  We decided to go with small plates to share between two. We picked a chopped vegetable salad (cucumbers, zucchini, tomatoes, onions, peppers) that came with feta cheese, garlic croutons in a creamy greek dressing. Best salad I've ever had. It was so light and all the vegetables tasted amazingly crisp and fresh! The garlic croutons were a dream and the feta and dressing brought it all together.  We also ordered the spicy tuna tartare with avocado, pickled ginger, cucumber, and sesame wontons. Delicioussssss!!! Beautiful fresh chopped tuna and perfectly balanced dish.   It's hard to say which of the plates was the favorite but the truffle potato chips with the maytag blue cheese sauce were so freaking good. I can't emphasize it enough. The truffle chips are topped with a warm blue cheese sauce that elevated them to perfection.  For dessert we had a Smore pie. Chocolate cream pie in a graham cracker crust, with toasted marshmallow and vanilla ice cream. OMG. WINNER!!!  I wish the Wolfgang Puck here in Orlando were like this one, but it's not.",

My bf had the Italian omelet, and it was stuffed with mushrooms (his fave!).  His potatoes were a little salty according to him, but I thought it was perfect.  Both entrees were huge and we were stuffed.  This place is really great for casual dining, its right in the middle of the MGM casino.  I probably would come again.",

The dressing was amazing, light and the whole thing was covered with these little crispy things (aged parmesan and toasted crostini maybe?) Delicious. Would go back just for the salad.

Location is actually horrible, it's an open layout overlook the Cirque Ka theatre (which filled up quickly) and the smell of smoke from the nearby casino nearly made me lose my appetite. Food itself was so-so. For appetizer we ordered the crispy fried calamari, pretty good although I would have preferred marinara over the lemon aioli. For entree I ordred the white pizza with chicken, spinach, garlic and feta. Pizza is large enough for 2 people to share, I barely ate half and boxed the rest. Once again, alright but nothing to brag about. Husband ordered the grilled salmon, once again nothing special. Which is my ultimate conclusion about this place, alright food, nothing special. With the plethora of options in Vegas and on the strip, I would pass on this one unless you are looking for something convenient and moderately priced. Side note, right across from this restaurant is Joel Robuchon, a 5 star (and extremely price) French place. What a dichotomy of choices !",

We ordered what was supposed to be fried chicken wings for an appetizer... instead we got these really strange fried bone things. They seriously looked like a fried wontonwith a huge rat bone sticking out of them. And to our surprise, there was supposedly chicken in there mixed in with some strange tasting batter and some sort of vegetable...we couldn't tell. The strangest thing was that on the menu it literally said fried chicken wings, not 'weird mystery meat and vegetable drumstick thing'.   Everything else we ordered was either greasy, oversalted, or just overpriced. Puck needs to either take his name off this place or revamp it. Skip it and eat somewhere else.",

I'm a huge fan of their steamed mussels - they give you a crapload of steamed mussels in this garlicy-cream sauce and some sourdough bread w/ bernaise sauce... all for $21.  Unless you are a mussels lover, I would recommend that you share this dish with someone else b/c like i said... they give you a crapload of mussels.  I like all their pasta dishes.  The noodles are always cooked al dente and their sauces that compliment the pasta are always so tasty!!!    Overall, I think this is a great place to eat dinner if you want something other than a buffet and are not really feeling the desire to splurge lots of money on food.",

My friend had a pear drop martini and I had a mojito- I liked her drink a little more. Our waitress was wonderful- I told her we had a show to get to and she quickly took care of the check and boxes to go. Then she brought us bags before we even had to ask.

    "text": "At Best Average and Nothing Special  Was staying at the MGM and thought dining at the Wolfgang Puck's Bar & Grill would be a good experience. Overall I would say it was average at best and there are many more places with similiar price tags that has better food.  The ambience is what I best remember of the restaurant. It was very hip and very well done.  The problem with the restaurant is the noise level. It is located right in the center of the casino, so the place can get very noisey. If you're looking for a quite dinning experience this not it.   The food here is ok. The planting and presentation is excellent but the food is just ok. Appetizers start at $10 up to $20. Had the grilled chopped vegetable salad and this was the best part of the whole dinning experience. My girlfriend had the pizza and it was ok. Nothing special and had better pizza at my local pizza stop. I had the flat iron steak and that was ok. It wasn't anything special either and just as good as my local stop. The portion size was good to poor. The vegetable salad was enough for two, the pizza was about a 12 inch pizza. The steak was a small amount steak and you had more fries than steaks.  The prices here are about double than most places.   Overall it might be nice for a lunch or to say you've been there but overall nothing special.",

We were sat in a nook and the decor reminded me of a country kitchen--it was cozy. I got the gnocchi which I thought was great!

We were seated promptly despite not having a reservation during the lunch hour. The menu is small (one page worth of food) but varied. I ended up getting the prime steak panini and potato salad. Great mix of flavors with the panini and barbeque sauce dip (with a hint of horseradish). The potato salad was probably one of the best I've had...it wasn't too sour and had just enough mayonnaise to keep it rich.   Unfortunately what brought this rating down for me was the service. Slow service. It took a while to get our check, and even longer to get back my credit card. I think I only saw the server once after my food came.",

    "text": "Thinking of the tuna tartare is making me moist. The menu here, especially the appetizers, is brilliant. This is one of my favorite lunch time restaurants in Vegas.   The atmosphere of Wolfgang's is incredibly trendy. The restaurant is almost all white and features lots of curves. The tables were nice and chairs were pretty comfortable. The menu's were also presented very uniquely as they were posted on a wooden board and held on by a rubber band.   The service was exceptional. Our waiter originally thought they were out of the tuna tartare (I was completely distraught and screamed like a little girl) but then checked and reported to us that they just got a new shipment. Appetizers were served promptly with the entrees coming just as we finished up. My soda glass was always atleast half full.   I definitely recommend the appetizers. I've already mentioned the tuna tartare which is one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life. It's a spicy tuna topped with avocado and served with lightly fried tortillas and a little bit of the most amazing chile sauce I've ever had. Seriously, the thought of the tuna tartare brings my buddy to tears. It's that good.   We also enjoyed the crab cake appetizer which was also quite exceptional.  For my entree I've had the mussels and the fish and chips. The mussels were served in a lemon garlic sauce with foccacia bread. The portions were extremely generous and it was a meal that I enjoyed very much. The fish and chips were disappointing because this restaurant does not have malt vinegar! Luckily the fries were the bomb. You also get one of those mini catsup bottles to impress the ladies.   Overall this is a breathtaking lunch and is highly recommended. Poker comps work here! Get the tuna tartare please.",

I chose the Organic Chicken (with Garlic Potato Puree, honey glazed carrots, and spring peas).  We all tried the raspberry \"Flirtinis\" which were really good.  The food was excellent (hot, excellent flavor, crispy skin on the chicken, great tasting vegetables) and was reasonably priced.  The restaurant itself was open and airy with a definite Crate and Barrel appearance and a semi-casual atmosphere.  The wait staff was efficient and friendly.  I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.",

There was one with just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. ;)  I had the gnocchi with sausage. It was good. I finished it all. It wasn't spectacular but nice solid gnocchi--not literally.  The steaks ordered at the table were reported as being perfect. I had a bit of the flat iron and then had a second bite.  After that I had no room for dessert. Bill came quick and we were outta there.  A word on the steaks--reasonably priced($35 & $45) compared to craftsteak where the cheapest steak was $45.",

Melissa was our server and was FANTASTIC! She knew the menu well and helped us with our choices. We were very crabby upon arrival as we had just flown in from other parts of the country and had problems connecting at the airport; tired and just anxious to get checked into the hotel, settled and have something good to eat. The minute we entered this restaurant, everything changed for the better! The staff could not do enough to please. I had the chopped salad that was to die for. It was as if they had just gone out into the garden and picked the fresh butter lettuce and other mix. The presentation was lovely. The dressing was spectacular and the portion was oversized! Others in our party had the wedge salad and were equally pleased with freshness, portions and flavors. We shared a gourmet pizza that was the perfect size, picture perfect and the flavors were amazing! The crust was delicious! If you like espresso, you must try theirs! I have never had an espresso experience like this. We all walked out of that restaurant refreshed, full and very, very happy! Great food, great service. Great for people watching. Highly recommend this restaurant and I can't wait to visit again!",

His restaurant in the GTA failed, his line of soups can oven be found in the clearance bins at the grocery store, and his line of over-priced sandwiches in airports are a joke.  So when a salesrep offered to take me to Wolfgang Pucks Bar & Grill I was a little trepidatious.  Its a very open concept restaurant in the heart of the gaming floor near the Cirque du Soleil store.  We were looking for a casual dining experience and that's what we got.  As an appetizer we started off with mac and cheese and a house salad shared across the table.  The Mac and cheese was awesome.  The cheese was creamy with a distinct flavour.  If my 6 year old were present even he would have loved it.  For the entree I had the wood-fired chicken pizza.  I picked it because it had a number of veggies on the pizza as well.  It tasted good going down.  The portion size was quite filling.  I couldn't finish the last slice.  This visit left me with my opinion of Wolfgang Puck increasing favourably.",

It took me and my boyfriend over 50 MINUTES to get our dinner, and it was something very simple too - plain linguine pasta w garlic oil and a beef plate.... Does that really take an hour to make?  On top of that, our waitress was new and was in training. I have nothing against that, esp since she was trying her best to cater to all her tables. But honestly, If she was in training, shouldn't the Waiter that's training her keep an eye out for her to make sure she's doing okay? I asked for a box for my food twice and still didn't get a box so someone had to come and do it for me. We had to ask several people what was taking so long with our food, and when we asked for bread we had to ask MULTIPLE TIMES TO MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I get if the restaurant is just so packed and hard to remember all tables' orders, but if I have to ask them multiple times for the bread, my box, AND my main course meal.. There's a problem.  Oh, and our total came out to $88 which was not worth the quality of this food NOR the horrible service.",

We got complimentary rasin bread to start off with butter. After looking at the menu we decided to start off with the crab cakes which was delicious! I wish they were bigger, but they were perfect bite size, but 4 pieces for $18 was a little much.  Afterwards, I got the spicy clam with linguine. They were VERY generous with the clams and there was bite sizes of bacon mmm very good.  The bf got the meat loaf which was cooked just right. There was onion rings on top and the mash potato stacked on the bottom of the meatloaf. I loved the mash potato because it was really rich and savvory.   We enjoyed both dishes and our waitress gave us a complimentary cream brulee. She was very sweet and took our picture and told me that it was facebook worthy haha.  All in all, I had a wonderful experience at Wolfgang Puck. 1 appitizer. 2 main entree. free dessert. This was my first time at this location. Next time, I want to try the upscale resturant because the only downside was that it was an open area so the slot machines were distracting and I didn't free like I was at a resturant. It was great for people watching with the open kitchen which made it very homey.",

It's awesome for efficient service and is open till the wee hours of the night :)   This time we had the...  1. tuna tartare - which was raw tuna mixed with spicy mayo, a little bit of teriyaki sauce (as far as my tastebuds could tell) and topped with avocado. Almost like a sushi without the rice! It was delicious! The crispy golden wanton chips were the perfect companion for this dish. Too bad we only had 4 chips!!! Unlike at Pacific Catch where they give you more than you can count!   2. Crab cakes - The waiter was very accommodating. Even though crab cakes was not on the menu for the evening he put in a special request for us. They were delicious!   3. Lastly, dessert - chocolate beignets -  my favorite!!! Except this time, they didn't have chocolate, instead they had regular beignets stuff with light citrus tasting custard. It was even better than the chocolate beignets! Chocolate beignets with chocolate dip can get a little excessive and I could never eat more than 3. However, regular beignet felt much lighter in comparison and I could easily waffle down 4 with  a nice not-too-sweet caramel toffee dip.",

We shared the starter (tuna tartare 21 dollar) which was very good. Our son wanted a lasagne (21 dollar). Remark : very strange taste. The shrimp pasta (26 dollar) was too expensive. The fish of the day was very casual (33 euro) so also too expensive. We ended with a pear cheesecake (12 dollar) which was better the day before somewhere else.... The cafe latte was ok (4,50 dollar). The waiter was too pushy for his tip, in spite of a bill from 162,42 dollar..... The prices are raised and we don't see a reason why... no extra service or something special to order. For being 'a brasserie' it's not worth at all. We will not return, because for this price, we can eat better somewhere else.",

    "text": "We found ourselves still awake, a little drunk, and starving at 4am on a Thursday morning while staying at MGM and realized there were only two options for food.  McDonalds (ugh) or Wolfgang Pucks.  Wolfgang Pucks totally overexposed itself.  I think of WP and think of airport food or frozen pizza.  Or well.. just commercialized bullsh*t.    But, there was no way we were going to McDonalds.  We found our seats at the bar, told the bartender we had a Prima card and he immediately put in a free order of Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese and Chives.  Looking through the menu we stopped on the \"Croque Madame\" - Grilled Ham and Gruyere with Fried Egg and Mixed Green Salad and both decided that we should each get one.  I mean, come on, who can split a croque madame.  Now here was go.  The potato chips?  Stupid good.  Truffle sauce lined the bottom of the plate.  The blue cheese was soft and scoopable and we finished every last morsel on the plate.  Amazing.  But the croque madame was the winner.  Actually it was the food winner of the entire vacation.  Never in my life have I tasted something so sinfully delicious.. ham, gruyere, bechamel, the perfect fried egg... holy heaven.  The thing was bigger than my head.  The side salad was tossed with a dressing that actually tasted like a breakfast salad.   I finished the entire thing and still wanted more.  My opinion of Wolfgang has been forever changed back to the great chef, leader and brand we knew him to be.  If you're in Vegas, I swear to god you need to stay up late - go to Wolfgang Puck - order the croque madame and potato chips... and your trip to Vegas will be worth every dime that you lost in Vegas.",

The pizza was a surprising combo, it was good, but it did get slightly soggy, too much sauce maybe? I loved the salad that came with mine it was wonderful, if a bit over dressed. Arugula, spinach, various baby tomatoes (heirloom?), and parmesan. The chicken was good but a little salty, and though our waitress said she loved the sauce it wasn't my fav, which is fine, there was a bit of lemon to squeeze over the chicken, it worked. And - I had to leave a whole piece of chicken. Too much food, and when you have a thing about food going to waste...",

    "text": "Words cannot begin to describe how atrocious my experience was at this restaurant. I am still bright red. I have never felt so humiliated in my life. Everything started out fine, we were seated promptly, the bread was nice and very fresh, the Pinot Grigio was good. To be fair the starters were delicious, I shared the calamari with my brother and tasted my dads ribs. Both were great choices, then the mains arrived....to say my ravioli tasted like a microwave meal...it was completely bland and the edges of the ravioli on the outside of the dish were rock hard, the way it would be had it been microwaved. I decided to ask the server, an overweight woman with dark hair pulled back, if it had in fact been microwaved. Let me point out that I was polite in asking, I have worked in enough customer service jobs, food and hospitality, retail etc, to know what it's like to be at the receiving end of irate customer complaints...well the condescension that my query was met with. I have never experienced such rudeness, she spoke to me like I was a two year old, calling me sweetie, and smirking whilst telling me they had no microwave on the premises. But that she could make it all better if I wanted a new one. At this point my dad and brother were half way through their meals and I didn't want to sit watching them eat and then have them sit and watch me eat. So I declined the offer. On collection of our plates, she turned to the bus boy and whispered something while smirking and jerking her head in my direction and he then looked over at me and they both walked off. At this point I went to the manager and while I was waiting the server swept in when she saw where I was headed. She then became apologetic in the most False way claiming I had misunderstood. The manager was standing beside us and he began to apologise. I sat back down and she brought dessert menus but I said I didnt want anything, my brother and father took menus to look, but at this stage I was so mortified and on the verge of tears that I had to ask them not to order anything so we could leave asap. Eventually she returned and when they said they didn't want anything she said they had intended on comping dessert despite the fact that I had already said I didn't want anything and it was only after everyone had refused dessert that we were told...how convenient. Ten minutes later the bill arrives, ravioli included! Could not believe they included it after everything. I have never been more appalled by service of this level in a restaurant that supposedly has a good reputation. Stay away!!",

The Truffled Potato Chips were delicious, and I'm not sure if Wolfgang Puck should put his name on this establishment. I should note that my buddy and I only had the Prime Burger with Vermont Cheddar and Smoked Onion Marmalade along with the chips so we had limited exposure to the menu. But hey, a great restaurant is supposed to make something simple into spectacular, and from its name the burger sure \"sounded\" delecious. While the name of the burger lights up your eyes, you palette is left bored and dismayed. Though it was cooked perfectly to my request of rare, there was no flavor that sprung out of the tender meat. Even the fancy smanshy cheese and onion stuff was bland and undeserving of the written text in the menu. Grab a beer and the chips here, but look elsewhere for simple, good eats. Yes, I do realize that's difficult in Vegas.",

    "text": "NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!    It started out pretty good. The restaurant is located inside of the MGM across from the Tropicana. They seated me right away. It was slightly busy.   Our waiter was very attentive in taking my order.  I ordered the 8oz. Filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts with bacon. A glass of Stella and a water.  I ordered my steak medium, I wanted to substitute but the waiter said he couldn't do that, in return I ordered the Brussels sprouts. The steak was BADLY cooked. It was burnt on the outside, overly cooked. While inside was cooked correctly. I couldn't get past the burnt taste every time I bit into it. The steak was chewy and I found nerve tissue in the steak as I tried my best to swallow it.   The potatoes were ok, they were over whipped or diluted. The taste was absent, but the asparagus was nicely cooked. The Brussels sprouts were also nicely cooked BUT the bacon had so much fat I wasn't even sure the taste was there, it felt like it may have been old or stale.   I informed the waiter of the displeasure with the steak. Rudely he replied..., \" what do you want me to do?\" And walked away. Never returned to check on me. I asked for my check and he said, \"sure, I'm busy with two other large order I'll get to you when I'm done.\" The bill summed up to about $92 dollars. I had two small bites of the steak, he didn't compensate nor remove it. Didn't offer to do anything else.   Worst Vegas dinner experience EVER!",

Ordered a couple cocktails, appetizer, entrees, and a dessert. The food overall was pretty good. The appetizer of the potato chips with the blue cheese sauce was DELICIOUS! I ordered the Prime burger and it was also pretty good. Fries were meh. The beignets for dessert were spot on. Overall a good meal.   The service- The buser Rako (I hope I'm spelling his name correctly) was AMAZING. Someone promote this man to server. The waiter/server was okay but not great. Took a long time to take orders, didn't really check on us much... felt bad giving him a tip and Rako either getting nothing or just a tiny portion. We made sure to let Rako know we loved him though. Tip for management: want 5 stars? Make Rako a waiter/server. He embodied everything a server should be. The rest of the wait staff basically stood around not doing much.",

The restaurant looked pretty packed, but the hostess sat us within a couple of minutes. There were many options, which made it very difficult to choose from. We settled on: Truffled Potato Chips, Caesar Salad, and a Chef's Special (sadly the name escapes me) The truffled potato chips were so good, it hit the spot for us. The salad was pretty good. The chef's special was perfect, it was a pasta dish with slow cooked beef, and red sauce. The portions were just right to share between two people. We had enough room for their half dozen chocolate chip cookies, and a side of milk.  Don't be surprised by the cost, it is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant on the strip.",

This place is nice and casual, perfect for families as well. It's a place you go to looking casual or fancy, dress it up or down, doesn't matter. I would recommend to try it when in Vegas and confused about which of the thousand restaurants to pick from.",

Wings were really good and crispy, just not very many.  And the pork chop was good as well.",

I couldn't make a reservation online but I figured we'd be ok for a Wednesday afternoon. They were busy but we didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered the chips with truffle blue cheese sauce. Boss doesn't eat cheese so we ordered it in the side. The cheese sauce is so good it should be illegal. My boss ordered the turkey club (comes with bacon and ham too) and i ordered the French dip. The foods prices are a little high but the portions are fairly big and but more importantly the food is serious quality! Over of the best French dips I've excellent had. The sandwich is served with a  order of giant onion rings. They were cooked perfectly. Great batter to onion ratio. They tasted light and airy. Since it was my birthday, my boss ordered me a berry cheesecake, he knows that's my favorite! Cheesecake was good... Although i was so full I could barely eat it! Service was pretty good even though our server seemed busy. Can't wait to come back.",

It's so simple but great quality with a delicious crispy skin.  The upscale yet casual menu & ambiance give a great in-between for those looking for good food without the stuffiness of some of the fancier restaurants nearby.  **TIP FOR THE SPORTS-HEAD** The bar plays the games at low volume, making it the ideal spot to catch a game & a good meal. Bartenders are friendly & attentive too.",

I was shocked to find that not many restaurants are open passed midnight. There are plenty of fast food restaurants but when in Vegas, my husband and I want to experience different and unique places (not your standard fast food). Luckily this bar and grill is open late and provided the exact solution we were looking for!   We ordered a pizza and the half jidori chicken plate. We didn't say we were sharing but it was so nice of the staff to split our plates evening. This created a simple and small touch but really left a lasting impression. It's the simple things that go along way! Overall they were both absolutely delicious. We didn't expect the chicken to be so tender and flavorful - it was so fantastic we couldn't stop talking about this dish days later. Definitely recommend! Don't get me wrong, the pizza was good too - but the chicken was so delightful!   Turns out that because we enjoyed our experience so much and know they're open late - we will be visiting again and can't wait to do so!",

The potato chips were too over drenched in truffle sauce causing a majority of the potato chips to be soggy. For my entree, I ordered the shrimp pizza to try something new. The mozzarella on the pizza was very fresh and tasted good with the pizza. However, the crust was not one of the best Italian crusts I have tasted. I took a bite of my sister's order of linguine with clams which had very nice subtle flavor that was not too overpowering. Unfortunately, my sister said the clams still had sand in them which made her run to the restroom to rinse out the sandy mess. I would come back again only if I'm in the MGM grand area but it would just not be my first choice. My friendly reminder for you would be to stay away from the clams or else you'll encounter a sandy mess!",

I love the presentation & how all of it combines so well.. the herbed remoulade, marinated cherry tomatoes, avocados were better than any Louis I have ever had.  Kudos to the chef!  Grilled Ribeye was cooked to perfection w/ a wonderful red wine au jus, fresh time & the caramelized shallots offered a nice flavoring, even tho I did not eat them.  The mash potatoes under the Ribeye almost tasted like a polenta, so flavorful!    The Grilled Octopus was a chef's special & as long as I have supported Wolfgang Puck restaurants he changes his menu up seasonally, like a Spagos for instance, I fall in love w/ something & next time it's gone.  These creations are absolutely mouthwatering.  The Grilled octopus & potato melt in your mouth.    Thankfully the chef could make the Shrimp Fettuccine that I am so in love w/!!  The buttery Fettuccine, Scampi Style Shrimp & that garlic is where it's at!  Not a fan of the Italian Sausage Pizza.  It was overwhelmed by caramelized red onions.  The creme fraiche, mozzarella, garlic & Fresno peppers gave it a nice touch so next time, no onions for me.    Thank you Chef Puck & chef's we don't see that truly deserve the credit.  Wish all things could remain the same & I am looking forward to the new one at Caesar's Forum Shops.",

I ordered a burger with bleu cheese and was shocked at the beautiful presentaion, size and flavor. It was big enough where two people could share and be satisfied.  The side of fries were salty but decent. I mean there fries.  The prices were a little steep but remember you are paying for the name as well.  Overall, it was a memorable meal and a great end too my night at the MGM.",

    "text": "WTF??   I just had the worse experience at your restaurant at the MGM Wolfgang Puck last night with seven of my friends at about 3am...   I ordered the eggs benedict with wild mushrooms instead of spinach. On my first bite of the mushrooms I had something weirdly chewy in my mouth. I was absolutely shocked and disgusted to suddenly discover it was a large blob of pink chewed chewing gum!!   We immediately called over the waiter who's first reaction was to say it couldn't have come from the food because it would have been more melted -????? I flipped out and demanded to see the manager stat.   After quite a wait and asking twice the manager came over and was very apologetic offering to comp my food and order me another. I explained there was no way I could eat ANYTHING now as I was literally sick to my stomach. I also told him that after working in the service industry for over a decade around the world (including Vegas and i personally owned a restaurant/bar here) I was surprised he wasn't going to comp the table for such a shocking health code and trust violation. He said he couldn't do that.   As we were talking security started hovering around our table and me and my party were mortified that the manager had called security because of our complaint. I asked him if the above camera was angled towards us and he said yes. I told him to review the footage to verify the authenticity of the situation. He said the best he could do was take something of the bill.   We were being made to feel like we were doing something wrong for complaining. The way the server, manager and security handled the situation was beyond appalling. Everyone in the restaurant was staring at us as the security just stood a couple of feet away from our table watching us eat. It was so embarrassing. At that point we closed out our check (the manager took off 25%) and we left immediately while the intimidating security hovered over us like criminals and followed us out of the restaurant  I wonder how Wolfgang would have handled the situation if he had been there himself.  Shame on you 'Wolfgang Puck MGM' :(  #WolfgangPuck #WolfgangPuckMGM #MGM #WolfgangpuckBarandgrilllasvegas #ShameonYou #Disgusted #TerribleService #shocked #ChewingGum #angrycustomer #badrestaurant #healthcodeviolation",

We ordered onion rings and a Caesar salad for apps, and a flatbread & chicken sandwich for our meal, everything came out tasting great. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and a great beer selection. We are frequent Vegas vacationers and will definitely be back to Wolfgang Puck in the future.",

We specifically requested a vegan pizza without any cheese. After eating the pizza, my daughter and I got extremely sick, unable to hold our bowels, stomach pains, etc... we weren't initially sure why. We returned to the resturant that evening at 9:30 p.m., and learned from a waiter named Darren, that the pesto sauce does indeed actually have cheese in it. He apologized, but I'm definitely planning to express a formal concern to a higher authority as it ruined entire day of our stay. Great food, great place, but we had a horrible vegan experience. However, we went back the following day and a waiter name James told a manager named JoJo what happened. As a result, she gave my entire family a complimentary vegan dinner! ...and it was great!",

Wolfgangs burger is the way to go. Great quality. Charred meat on the outside and medium rare on the inside. They even cut the burger in half if you wanted to share.   Pizza was bland and tasteless. There was no flavor and it lacked salt.   The service is superb, the burger was good for $17 but the pizza really sucked.",

    "text": "I could have sworn I reviewed this place the last time we were in Vegas!  We visited the first time on a whim and were so taken with the Jidori Chicken, we returned for my friend's birthday!  He was pretty excited by the suggestion so we walked all the way to MGM Grand 2 or 3 miles away just to order it.  The mushroom bisque we had before wasn't on the menu this time, so we ordered a split of the chicken with a side of the roasted cauliflower with Parmesan cheese.    Jidori Chicken has a lovely crunchy crust and they serve you a half chicken over Yukon Gold mashed potatoes with a soy sauce glaze that is richly salty and satisfying.  The cauliflower is very rich.  It's great, but lots of cheese and butter so make sure you share the calories!    Service at this 24 hour joint is top notch.  They split the order no issue at all and no fee.  Prices are about average for the typical upscale casino restaurant.  $28 for the chicken which is a fair (not huge) portion and $8 - 10 for sides or appetizers.  Drinks are what drive the bill up, of course, so order with caution.    We happened to mention that we were there to celebrate a birthday and they brought us a special creme brulee for dessert at no charge!  It was a little weird now that I think of it since we turned down the dessert menu.  We were stuffed, but it was so wonderfully creamy with a perfect burnt sugar crust we managed to down about half of it.  Burp.",

Filled with nutella and a served with a banana cream dipping sauce.  Service is a pretty big influence on the experience overall and our server and bussed solidified the 5 stars. Robert, our server, was very personable and funny. He had some great suggestions as well.   Josh, our busser, was extremely polite, quick to clear any empty plates and/or ask if we would like refills.  I noticed two things he did that I have NEVER experienced before. The first was he a sked for permission to clear the plate, he didn't only ask if we were done he asked if it was ok if he clear it. The second was when he was setting up for our desserts to arrive. He set the women first, then the children and then last the men. Old school manners that get noticed and go along way!!",

    "text": "I made reservations 2 weeks ahead prior to my trip to Las Vegas. I would recommend reservations, for Wolfgang gets pretty packed. This restaurant attracts many being located by the MGM casino. It is located by KA ticket booth as well as MGM's concierge.   We arrived here to dine before a show and waited a few minutes before being seated even with reservations. Our waiter comes shortly afterwards with onion bread and butter. My friends couldn't stop eating the bread.  I quickly ordered the Truffled Potato chips (3/5), thinking it would be amazing from previous Yelpers dining here. These chips are drizzled with Maytag Bleu Cheese. I was quite disappointed when I took the first bite, for there was some factor lacking in this appetizer. We asked for Tabasco sauce and jalapenos, which made the chips taste x10 better than previously. The waiter gave us 4 cute travel sized Tobasco bottles! I had to take one home. Anyways, these chips are great for munching on in front of a TV, not at a restaurant.  Unfortunately, we were quite full from our lunch several hours before. We decided to order another appetizer, Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers (4/5) served over a bed of coleslaw. I enjoyed these more than the chips. The steak skewers (5 of them) were juicy, like the juices were crying out when the steak was being cut. The house steak sauce was neither spicy nor sweet. It was between the middle, which went well with the coleslaw.   Our waiter refilled our bread basket when we asked for more that he gave us some for to-go as well. My friend was pretty happy. The atmosphere is casual but still modern/contemporary-like inside. This place is open from 11AM-6AM, so it's great to eat here any time with your date or group.",

    "text": "Slacking on these reviews,, but trying to get back into it :D.   Decided to come here because we were staying at MGM and didn't want to go through the hassle of going to another hotel and rushing back to get ready to go out. I made the reservation day of at around 3 pm for 14 people and told them that we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday and they were able to accommodate.  When we got to the restaurant, we were led to this little room near the wine rack. It was nice because there was a sliding door that separated us from everybody else, so we kind of got a private room. When we sat down and looked at the menu, it had \"Happy Birthday Eric!\" on the top. I was so surprised! 5 Stars for printing out new menus just for us :) Service was amazing. Always checked up on us and everybody who served us was very professional and friendly.   The menu is not too extensive, but there was a good variety of food. I ordered the ribeye and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was light and delicious, but I've never had bad fried calamari. The ribeye was very good. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Came with potatoes and some veggies. The glaze was a little on the sweet side, but not too overbearing. I was also able to try the chicken breast and let me tell you, it was the juiciest chicken I have ever had. Probably would get this the next time we come here. The food did take a little while to come out, but I think it was cause they wanted to serve us all at the same time.   All in all, food was good, service was amazing, and boy did they make us feel special. Last but not least, we had a party of 14 and they didn't even charge the 18% gratuity!! Our waiter told us that he was leaving it up to us, but of course we gave the 18% for the wonderful service we received.   TAKEAWAYS:  + service!!!",

    "text": "This Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill is a semi open space just by the MGM casino, within eye sight of the Cirque Du Soleil box office.  There for a slightly late lunch, I was told it would be 10 minutes for a table or I could grab a spot at the bar immediately.  I pounced on door #2 and made myself comfy.  Too bad they didn't seem to have a purse hook.  It was rather awkward perching there with a purse balancing on my lap.  I ordered up their chicken salad sandwich $15, and gee, wasn't it just terrific?  It was a mix of sweet and savory, of soft and crisp.  Even the green mix salad accompanying it was good.  It beat me though... I had to give up and leave a slice of bread behind... bringing shame to the clean plates club.",

Instead of being diligent and paying attention to if you need assistance or are trying to get their attention, they interrupt your meal every 2 minutes. They ruin every biteful of food. Are you okay? Do you need anything? I need to eat my meal in piece. By the time they left us alone all our food was col. Especially some blonde male waiter. WHenever I think about going here, I have horrible flashbacks of being harassed, biting on my rfork, and the worst dining experience imaginable. Take my order and leave me the hell alone.  Bring me my food, and then leave me alone again.   I have eaten here alone and still been constantly harassed. It's insane. No one wants to be interrogated while eating. The food is good but there's no time to put it in your mouth between all the verbal questions you are asked, and then forced to answer while they wait around for the answer with bated breath? How's everything? they ask again and again FINE until your shadow darkened my plate",

We got the pepperoni olive pizza & steak skewers.   The pepperoni was housemade, but it may as well not have been because I couldn't taste the difference. It was overally a bit too salty (maybe they should've taken into account the saltiness of the toppings before seasoning).   The steak skewers were tender, but the slaw wasn't dressed enough. The presentation was nice though.  Service was prompt & the bartender was friendly.  I would only go back for the people watching & random funny attention.",

It was a salty water \"soup\" with uncooked onions (lots of them) there were no parsnips in the soup at all (which was listed as an ingredient on the menu).    I wasn't served by my waitress, and when she finally did come to check on me, I asked if the soup ($13 bowl of soup) comes with bread or crackers... she said, \"we don't usually offer bread to our lunch customers, but I guess I could give you some if you want\".  Also, I was seated next to some wood bark object, that they have separating the restaurant from the casino, and when I got a good look at it, it was dusty and filthy. So gross... had I noticed prior to ordering my soup I would have never eaten there.   Really?",

The first night we splurged on an excellent salmon dish, prepared perfectly and complimented with a fresh garden salad and brussels sprouts (without the bacon). The service was excellent and I enjoyed the not too loud environment. The second time we went mainly because many of the other restaurants had closed (who knew places closed at 10pm in Vegas!?), but it was an equally great meal! I was happy to go back, but obviously on such a short trip we had hoped to try other restaurants. This time we shared a salad and pizza, I made my half veggie and my friend had chicken on hers. We both ate all of our slices and left feeling great for the evening ahead! If you can splurge definitely try a seafood dish, and if you are feeling a little more financially reserved, the pizzas are a great and filling option.  Enjoy :)",

    "text": "I came here Sunday August 4th for dinner.  I had the lasagna, 2 friends had the pizza and 2 others in my group did not eat.  It was an average meal.  Fast forward to 10 hours later, early Monday morning, I woke up to a churning stomach, went to the restroom where I proceeded to spew out red tomato sauce from BOTH ends.  It was a terrible morning.  Both of my friends who had pizza woke up and had considerable GI discomfort all morning.  They weren't as bad as me, but they were not enjoying life.  Essentially, our Monday drive home was miserable.  The two who did not eat were fine.    I called the restaurant Wednesday evening, after I felt better to let them know I had possibly gotten food poisoning from their restaurant.  The manager immediately doubted me -- blaming the sickness on too much drinking (absurd).   I had maybe 5 beers the entirety of Sunday.  So unless a server shoved a bottle up where the sun doesn't shine before serving me, I have a hard time blaming it on the beer.  Not to mention, I'm in my 30's...I went to college...I am fairly familiar with alcohol sickness and hangovers.  This was not that.  I explained to the manager that there were 5 of us and we all ate at the same places all weekend, except for Sunday night, when only 3 of us ate...the same 3 that got sick.      The manager proceeded to proclaim that you get food poisoning 72 hours after ingestion.  I had to look that up...it's not True.  Why he would lie?  I have no idea.  He just really didn't seem to even being open to the notion that his restaurant got me sick.  Regardless, I didn't call asking for anything...I only called to inform them of the events and how my friends and I narrowed it down to their establishment.  The manager asked for my contact info and told me their general manager would get back to me in 24 hours.  It has been 5 days.  Not expecting that phone call...and I'm not expecting to ever eat at a Wolfgang Puke establishment again.",

    "text": "Pretty overpriced, but its getting hard to tell if that's just the Vegas thing, or because it's got Wolfgang's name attached to it. I say overpriced, but shockingly they also have one of the cheapest items around as well: their pizza. The pizza was ridiculously cheap compared to everything else, was under $20 and was more than enough for two people (we had a box to take the rest home).  The people near us had a burger and steak, and neither seemed too happy with their choices. The burger was cooked beyond recognition, looked like a huge hunk of coal.  Their pasta looked good, but not almost $30 a plate good.  Oh, and our pizza was decent, a little plain though. The crust was ridiculously basic, no flavor or spices added to it, overall didn't have a ton of flavor, but if you're drunk or high I'm sure it tastes pretty good. Just don't order a soda or anything, they're like $5 each or some nonsense. Their wines start at like $70, so that was really off the list for us to try.",

And the bus boys were also very accommodating.  The food was delicious. The Chinese chicken salad thing was excellent and so were the pizzas.  The waiter automatically brought out desserts for my friends birthdays without me having to even tell him which was very very nice. And everyone said by to us as we were leaving.

    "text": "Having experienced terrible service and food at a fairly expensive restaurant during a previous visit, my group decided to find something well-recommended and decently priced. Also, celebrity chef restaurants were brought up, and because Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill was right by KA, it won!  We were seated in a fairly short amount of time [it was a bit after 9pm on Sunday, but still busy]. The decor was interesting [plaid ceilings and floral glass \"walls\"]. The restaurant is on a platform overlooking the waiting area for KA and was right near the MGM casino. My friend noticed after dinner that there were a ton of servers, but only one female server which was quite the opposite of... everywhere!   The waiter seemed very jazzed about dinner and explaining everything, and we were worried when he didn't write anything down, but he was awesome! Braden was nice, funny, got everything right, and he was great about checking in with us. Our water glasses were always full, and our food was amazing! There were multiple people who did the water, drinks, and food serving [they did bring out the food to the wrong people, but they got the orders right so what does it matter?].  My mouth was watering just reading the menu, but I wasn't feeling great so I thought I'd pick smaller options--hah! I got Mac'n Cheese and Roasted Cauliflower. The Mac'n Cheese wasn't anything amazing, but it tasted pretty good with the cauliflower in it. Two people at the table got the lasagna, which tasted like regular lasagna, but it did have a nice presentation. My sister got the gourmet burger. It was $25 and SO worth it! She asked for medium, and it was pretty pink and soooo flavorful! It came with thinly sliced and fanned avocado, all the fixings, and incredibly tasty fries. I believe my boyfriend got the Italian sausage pizza with goat cheese, and that was also super tasty and a decent size.   The only complaint we really had was that the ginger lime iced tea did not taste at all gingery. We agreed that this place was pretty great, and if we're ever in Vegas again we'll have to try one of Puck's other restaurants!   Last bit--they had quite a large group in there at several long tables, so they can accommodate big groups!",

    "text": "I was highly surprised by how good Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill was.  So much so that we came here 3 times in our 5 day, 4 night stay.  Obviously it's a little on the pricier side because it's Wolfgang Puck but I thought the flavors were super good and consistent.  We definitely paid for quality and taste.  Actually, the portion sizes were generous as well.  The first time here, my friend and I ordered the Pork Belly BLT and the Garlic-Chili Glazed Wings.  Holy hell.  Both were really good.  The BLT was delicious especially with the use of arugula instead of typical lettuce and the pork belly was very flavorful.  Even though it was good, I still felt like it was lacking something.  Maybe a stronger sauce or more pork belly?  Not sure.  But the pasta that came with it was lackluster, next time I would ask them to sub it out with fries or something.  We barely touched it, better to save our calories for more tequila ;)  As for the garlic-chili wings, they were really yummy and good-sized wings.  I liked the flavor on them.  So much so that we ordered them again after our night at Tabu Lounge.  One of my friends got a different salad each time she went and she really enjoyed them.  My favorite was the Caesar salad with no white anchovies.  The cheese that accompanied it was potent but in such a good way :P  We were able to split the salad three ways no problem :)  I can't say anything about the drinks since we didn't order any but the service was very good as they consistently refilled our water glasses.  I guess they know us drunkies are dehydrated :P  I would definitely come back to try some of their other fare on the menu.",

    "text": "I've walked my here a few times and wanted to try it. So on my most recent trip to Las Vegas we have it a try after we caught a show. There was a short wait, less than 5 minutes, and we were seated. As soon as I saw there was a burger on the menu I was done looking. My dad had the same. As it turned out this would cause a major problem. Our server was great. I forget his name but he's an Oakland A's fan so he's alright in my book. The food took awhile to come out but they were busy despite the short wait for a table. A runner brings our burgers mine medium rare and my dad's medium. He places mine in front of me saying its medium rare then the same for my dad but stating his is medium. Wrong on both counts. It spurns out the forgot he had them as they should have been placed. So I got a medium well burger, still wrong no matter who's it was supposed to be and my dad got mine. I cut it open see it's over cooked and shrug it off as I'm hungry but still a little disappointed. My dad sends his back. I eat while he's is being cooked and my dad gets his when I'm done. He really hates that. It always ruins his meal having to wait and eat after everybody else is done. The burger for being over cooked for my taste was still very good. There was something about the pickles on it that I can't place but was so darn good. Luckily my dad hates pickles so I got some more. I liked the food and would be willing to give it another try but I hope then don't make the same simple mistake again.",

    "text": "You saved us when we were dying of hunger after watching the late show of Crazy Horse Paris.  My friends and I were wandering around MGM Grand looking for a place to chow down and stumbled upon you.  I've never eaten at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant before and don't count all those stands I see at airports or canned soup in the grocery store.  We did a quick scan of the menu and were sold.  No problems at all getting seated about 10 PM on a Saturday.  Originally I was going to order the mushroom, leek, taleggio, thyme, and asparagus pizza but something amazing caught my eye.  The sweet pea and goat cheese filled tortellini with wild mushrooms, Parmesan, and TRUFFLE shavings.  I must have been a pig in a former life (literally not figuratively) as my eyes light up whenever I see that magical word on the menu.  It also came garnished with snow pea leaves - one of my favorite Chinese vegetables.  The portions were huge.  That caught all of us off-guard as we weren't really expecting that from a nice restaurant.  Plus we had eaten at the Bellagio buffet earlier in the day so wasn't looking to have that much food again.",

Nothing was too special. We had the soup of the day (black bean) the prosciutto tomatoes and Kalamata olive pizza, and fries.  Service was good. When the bread came to the table it was ice cold so we asked them to toast it up, which they did. Small things like that make a difference. The fact that we got refrigerator cold bread ruins the name of the restaurant.  Bottom like.. This place was just okay.",

Food: Pizza - I didn't like this pizza neither did my boyfriend. I guess we have a pretty high standard for pizza. The pizza was pretty greasy, which made the crust wet and everything tended to slide off the pizza. Also the pepperoni wouldn't tear that easy so we ended up eating the whole pepperoni at once.  Pasta (linguini with clams) - I loved it! The pasta was home-made and you can really taste the freshness. The chewiness and thickness was perfect, which was a big must for me. The favor could of been a little bit better, but it was good enough for me.   Price: Each entree is about $20-50, which is pretty normal for places in vegas.   I would recommend this place to anyone!",

    "text": "LOVED LOVED THIS restaurant. In fact so much we went twice during our one week stay at the Signature. First time there were six of us, four adults two children under 14.  We made reservations on opentable (6pm) The restaurant called me the day of to confirm our reservations. They brought us nice warm bread and butter!. We ordered calamari, rib eye, flat iron steak, pasta w/shrimp, veggie pizza, and a shrimp caesar salad. ALL I can say is DELICIOUS. No complaints what so ever. The staff is on point! Our water glasses were constantly being filled, our iced tea glasses were always filled to the max. On the second visit with two adults we ordered the sausage pizza and a caesar salad. The staff is so on point that I had to ask for the Manager to tell him about our fabulous meal.",

Once with six family members, once with for family members and once by myself at 2am. Strangely I received fte best service at 2am. Each time I ordered the steak sandwich which was excellent (although a bit grisely). Not a great deal for $22 but not bad for hotel food prices. To bd honest, my visits with the family were a bit pricey ($300-$500) but the food was good and the service was pretty good too.  I like this place most for a late night snack after a long night doing Vegas type activities like dancing, drinking, and gambling (Ahhh the good life). Anyway, good food, good service, fair prices (for a hotel). 4 Stars.",

We ordered two pizzas with the intention of sharing.(They are very big for one serving I thought). My wife had a Roasted Chicken, House BBQ Sauce, Corn, Pasilla Peppers, Red Onions, Cilantro and I had the Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese. Both were good but I preferred mine. Before the appetizer was brought out, we were given some very tasty bread. Two pieces had Caramelized Onions on it...mmmmmm! Due to the size of the pizzas, much was wasted and there was no room for dessert. The service was exceptional. Definitely worth the money",

    "text": "Worst customer service, so-so food= not coming back to Wolfgang's. Total bummer. we were really excited to eat here while staying at the MGM for a convention. We were there for WPPI and had a group of four photographers.   Super cute decor and good vibe, until we were greeted, or should I say not greeted by our server. It seemed as if we were bothering her by sitting down. Crappy attitude from the minute we sat down. Total ruined our vibe instantly. We tried to stay focussed on fun and not her crappy attitude.   I asked a few questions about the wine and she acted as though I was a complete idiot. She did not even understand my questions. Ok, moving on. Our food came before our drinks...WTF? We are in Vegas! Ok, they bring two out of four plates of food, then drinks, then the other two plates, over a 8-9 minute stretch. Frustrating!   My mushroom raviolis were good ($25.00) , my friends gnocchi was soft and mushy. Spaghetti;s were fine.   Manager happens to stop by our table and asks how things are. I decided to tell him what a bad experience we were having. He was apologetic and said he would make it better. He asked if we needed more drinks and kind of pushed that we all have another. We said ok. It was as if he was going to buy us a round for our troubles.The waitress never came back, he served us the rest of our meal.   Bill comes, he did not comp us even one thing. He acted as if he was going to and then nothing. Whenever a manager gets involved usually at least one think is comped. It was actually shocking. We had explained how we were here for business and how she ruined the whole vibe...anyways. We then said how disappointed in the whole night and especially our bill, when he pushed drinks on us and then didn't even comp them. He said he took the waitress out of the equation and thought that was enough. We didn't leave a penny for tip, and will definitely not go back next time we are in Vegas!   Go to the Asian Express in the food court, tasty cheaper food!",

The rigatoni with sausage was comfort food perfected. I didn't try the steak skewers, but my friends that had it, loved them. The last dish we had was a pizza with prosciutto, feta, basil and olives. It was rich, but delicious. The service was friendly and efficient.",

Wide open to the MGM casino which was great for people watching. Food was very good. My wife has the spagetti and she was raving about it a few days later. I had soup and salad (I know, sort of odd) and it was great. The salad with the blue cheese dressing was one of the best I have ever had. Small but excellent.  Prices are about what you would expect.

Salad with apples, aragula, spiced almond and dates - awesome! The best of what we got.  The service was mediocre.

I would recommend reservations for dinner for sure.  The salads are HUGE but you can ask for a half order (which I did the second time).   Butter Lettuce Caesar: 5/5 - love that it has anchovies, Humboldt Fog Cheese, garlic croutons.  The texture of the butter lettuce has a great crunch without being too watery like green leaf can be (w/ the stem).  Chopped Vegetable Salad: 4/5 - it was a very hearty salad - similar to what veggies you would get in a Greek salad; includes Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons, Creamy Greek Dressing  Sauteed Maine Crab Cakes:  5/5 - the textures worked really well together.  The crab cake had a crisp outside and full of crab on the inside; served with tomato relish, and a delicious basil aioli; just wished they had this as an entree.  Pizza - Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese:  3/5 - the crust could be more crunchy and less soggy, but they really loaded the toppings on, especially the prosciutto.  Pizza - Spicy Sopressata, Salami Toscana, Pepperoni, Sausage, Red Onions, Goat Cheese, Jalapenos:  3/5 - big serving and lots of toppings, but the crust would be better if it weren't soft/soggy in the middle, but more crunchy.",

I came here the majority of my stay because I wanted to be safe and they have a dedicated GF menu. The first night I got the ravioli- it was really good, but $21/plate is pretty pricey not to be filled up after eating. The second day I ordered the GF Margherita pizza and was kind of disappointed. The flour was brown (not sure what they used) and very bland/dry. There was too much sauce and not enough cheese and I was STILL not full after eating (it was $18 I think). I asked the waiter for a side of steamed veggies and got a yummy medley of cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and green beans. The staff was very nice and sensitive to my gluten allergy, so I would visit again if I stayed here.",

    "text": "First of all, I would like to say that I like the way they decorated Wolfgang Puck. It looks really nice on the outside and that kinda attracted me when we were walking around the MGM.   I also enjoyed the fact that this restaurant is a late night place because we went to watch the Ka show which was until 10-11? and that place was open. It was another reason why I love the place.  My friends and I decided to try this place out and our total party members was 8. The waitress that served us wasn't that great because I didn't even know she was my waitress until the check but the bus boy that served us was excellent. The water never ran out on us because the bus boy knows when to come back every time.   The menu that we got was pretty unique and I wanted to try everything but i only have one stomach. I got the fish of the day which was the halibut. The halibut was lay on top with the smashed corn and spinach on the bottom with roasted garlic. I really liked it. I love the corn and i love spinach so it was definitely a nice combination to me. Well its not only the spinach and corn that was great but the halibut was absolutely fresh. It had such a nice taste to it which was light yet flavorful. The inside of the fish was fresh and i can easily just slice through with my fork. I'm kinda drooling as im typing this hahaha.  ANYWAY I liked my entree' but i also got a mac and cheese with my friend and we shared half. It wasn't the greatest mac and cheese i tasted but it didnt taste bad. Personally i wouldnt recommend it though because i find it pricey and its not the best m.a.c. Although i don't recommend it and it is consider a side dish, it does get you full because there is 3 different kind of cheese in there so it is cheesylicious.  Anyway i also tried the other things which was pretty nice. I don't remember all the names anymore but most of the things that I've tried on the table was pretty good. I just personally didn't like the pizza. I mean I'm not saying that it is nasty but its like nothing special. If im gonna pay this much for a pizza that tasted around the same as most of the place then I wouldn't exactly recommend it.   Anyway it is worth trying it out so come here if you get a chance.",

I seriously could've eaten the whole plate myself. Very rich flavor and the bleu cheese was the best I've ever had. Steak skewers were my second favorite, really tender & the sauce was terrific. Calamari was good but didn't stand a chance against Federal Hill's.  Heirloom caprese salad was refreshing and the crab cakes were good but tiny. They did offer to give us an extra because only 4 came in an order.  Wish we had time for dessert because the chocolate beignets looked out of this world. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll def come back.",

Came around for dinner and were seated, water glasses filled, and drink orders taken almost immediately. They have unlimited, complimentary bread, which was delicious! Majority of the menu was either spaghetti, pizza, or meat (burger, fish, steak). We all ordered a different type of spaghetti. I'd highly recommend the linguini with Manila Clams, Garlic, Pancetta, Chili, Wild Oregano because out of all four dishes, that one was the best. My friend did add lemon to give it a little kick.  We ordered two marinara sauces - Housemade spaghetti and spaghetti&meatballs. They're your generic spaghetti with basil, tomatoes, and garlic, only differences was the type of tomatoes and that one had meatballs and one did not. Both of these dishes were so, so, SO salty that I drank about three giant gulps of water per spaghetti bite. And normally, I LOVE salt, BUT I had pee like crazy pregnant woman afterwards. o___o Too much salt!  The last dish we ordered was the Wild Mushroom Agnolotti, Sweet Peas, Caramelized Shallots, Parmesan. It was pretty good if you like more dough-y, lightly sauced pasta. I personally did not like it and felt it could be more flavorful, but each to their own. Also, they don't put salt or pepper shakers on the table (arrogant? or doing a classy look?) and they did not offer parmesan (even though they offered the table next to us parmesan. hmm why?).  Overall, food: 3/5. Service: 3.5/5.",

I have to say we were very pleasantly surprised as to how good the food was.  The Blue Cheese  Potato Chips were out of this world! ($13 I think) then we both had a glass of reasonably priced Malbec and Lasagna ($20 or so) for both (which is delicious) made with Bechamel, as my mom does!  We didn't want to spend more at L'atelier, and didn't want to do the ghetto Buffet :)  so this was a great and tasty option with free show (people watch) It's amazing how people go dressed in Vegas LOL Portions were very good as was the service.  For sure will be back, especially for the Blue Cheese Potato Chips!",

I've eaten at Wolfgang in LA and wasn't ever totally blown away so I didn't have high expectations here.   Chinese chicken salad was a really good salad.  I especially enjoyed the candied peanuts and the nice kick in the dressing.  They should sell those peanuts! I'd buy a case of them in a heartbeat!  Wood fired mushroom & broccolini pizza.  Pretty excellent pizza, in my book.  Loaded with toppings.  Easy sauce, just the way I like it.  And foldable, like the perfect NY style slice.   Service was above par as well.  She brought out our salad split into 2 servings without us even having to ask her to.  Gotta love those attentive servers.   All in all, a great dining experience.",

We wanted Craftsteak but all these high end steakhouses in Vegas close so early.  This choice worked out great though and I would never hesitate to eat here again (at a normal time or in the middle of the night). I opted for the meatloaf and it was great. My friends ordered the pepperoni pizza and the organic chicken and they both loved their choices.   Service was very good considering how busy it got. The focaccia bread they bring out was delicious also.",

I was received by a male and female bartender, the latter of which was just a bit snotty to everyone at the bar.  The hours are quite good compared to the other local restaurants.

My friends and I stayed at MGM Grand; I called for late check-out, packed all our belongings, headed out to find brunch, and stumbled upon this gem. It was surprisingly not packed considering it was prime grubbing time, but I'm not complaining!  My girls and I ordered our food and it came quickly; I got the french style omelet with field mushrooms, cheddar cheese, and tuscan potatoes. Sounds simple enough, but it was seriously delicious! Especially with all the sriracha I drenched it with, omnomnom.  The service was exceptional: friendly, attentive, yet never overbearing. More of our friends came to dine with us and they gladly pushed tables together.  I had a bite of everyone's food (mix of pizza, sandwiches, salads) because I'm curious and annoying like that, and all of it was scrumdiddlyumptious. They even have a decent beer selection.  It was great to recap and close out our entire trip with a place that has a relaxing/cozy/comfortable atmosphere and service that makes you feel at home.",

They've always been very receptive and never given us issues in redeeming. On our most recent trip, we ate here twice - lunch and dinner on separate days.  I love the decor and environment. It feels like it's dab smack in the middle of the casino floor and you get a good view of everything going on around you. Some might not like that if you want a quieter dining experience, but I enjoy it. Service has always ranged from good to excellent. Food is always good.  On our most recent trip, for lunch I had a French omelette. Was pretty good, cooked well. My wife had a crispy chicken sandwich, she enjoyed it. For dinner I had a Jidori Chicken dish that seemed like a brick-pressed half chicken. This has been my go-to meal here over the years, and it was pretty good, though a bit overcooked on this occasion. My wife had the fish of the day, which turned out to be red snapper. She enjoyed that as well.    In sum, I'd say this place is the epitome of a Yelp 4-star restaurant. I hope it never goes away as it's almost becoming comfort food whenever I'm in Vegas, but who knows with how fast things change in Vegas.",

I didn't have any appetizers either. The chicken was not as flavorful as I would expect.   The reason I am giving the place 4 stars is for ambience, price was decent and customer service was awesome (the manager even came by to ask if I was good-could have complained on chicken but ahh it was all good- I did eat it but I was still hungry late on)   I would recommend trying something else on the menu though.",

Also had a glass of Wolfgang Puck's Cabernet Sauvignon, which was a perfect pairing with my pasta.",

Maybe you had no time for dinner while trying to save your ass at the gambling table, or maybe you want Taco Bell's fourth meal without the \"Taco Bell\" part in it. There's nothing like eating a quality, non-shitty meal at 2:30am after a night of gambling, and for serving that up in the middle of the night with solid service, this place wins a fifth star.  Constant water glass refills, super awesome server (Bobby, I think? I was sober but am struggling from sleep deficit right now...), and good eats. I had the fettuccine with shrimp, which was so good, fresh, and well balanced that I ate the entire bowl.   As I'm a skank for bread, don't forget to ask for some since it's pretty good, albeit cold. Here's to you, Wolfgang Puck, for successfully finding a way to put more money in your pocket and good food in my mouth simultaneously.",

Sure she mentioned the days specials (well rehearsed I might add) but she got the pizza wrong & did not put in the calamari. Salad came fast because it was ordered right off the bat...pizza was refired and calamari came later on. You can tell she forgot it because it was listed last on the tab. Would have been nice to enjoy them together. She also offered parmigiana & red pepper flakes when the pizza was already half gone. I had had to ask for another bar drink rather than her offering. I recommend she repeat orders back to the guest so she can be sure what was ordered..too many mistakes for a place of that caliber...she was still tipped well though..",

They're open almost 24/7 (okay 6am is pretty 24/7 to me!) and they're located in the MGM which is just a sprawling mass of activities and food alike.   I've gotten various things there from steak, to sandwiches, to fries. Nothing was amazingly standout, but nothing was terrible or bad or even average. Everything was pretty good and the service was amazing even at 3am.   I would highly recommend this, but only if you're staying in MGM. I definitely would not uber or taxi here in the middle of the night, it's not worth the drive!",

    "text": "Walked in on a late 1am Friday morning.  Basically hungry from our flight and just wanted that White Castle craving to go away.    Luckily, there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated right away without reservation.  The dining area was set up nicely and clean.  Appearance was colorful, modern, and quite unique.  We were served by Albert, and he was attentive from beginning to end.  Only that's about it.  So, we started with the Truffled Potato Chips ($11) with a blue cheese sauce.  These were superb, but not anything to rave about.  I mean, I love truffle and I love blue cheese, but it couldn't keep my mind off those belly bombers.  I guess the chips and sauce really brought out the saltiness.  Meh, I knew I should've gotten the tuna tartare instead, oh well.    Now the Ceasar Salad ($13) was a winner, well kind of.  Fresh baby romaine leaves with the Ceasar salad dressing.  Though it tasted great, I personally thought it was small for the price.  The croutons were big and tasteless as well.    Then there was the Half Jidori Chicken ($28) with vegtables, a potato puree, topped with rosemary au jus, and a side of kale salad.  Now, for $28 this better be the best chicken ever.  It was excellent, but not the best ever!  Full of flavor, but you had to mix it all together to drown the over-saltiness.    Because of these dishes, we ordered their cheapest bottle of white wine, the Nuschese Pinot Grigio ($32).  A suitable choice especially for the chicken and salad.  A surprisingly enjoyable wine.  Thanks again to Albert's recommendation, it made for a good compliment.  We just killed that bottle!  So, overall, I've gone to several Wolfgang Puck locations and this just confirms I'm not a fan of his style.  After spending a total of $103 for two people, I simply feel this place is overrated and overpriced.  This place already put me in the hole!",

Our Hosts greeted us at the restaurant entrance and seated us with a view of the theater and gift shop.  Lots of activity as KA plays nightly.  Evan, our waiter, and Jose our busser, took great care of us as they made recommendations, cleared dishes, refilled water and coffee, and checked on us periodically.  The waiters and waitresses are well-trained, attentive, and a good representation of the WP branding.  Jose brought out a complimentary Garlic - Onion Foccacia which was very tasty.  The wife and I started with the Truffle Oil and Blue Cheese Potato Chips.  These babies are ADDICTIVE -great with a beer.  The chips are thick and crispy and oozing with cheese and truffle oil.  Good late-night, people-watching, beer food.  For entrees, the wife had the Butternut Squash Ravioli and I had the Grilled Sea Bass.  Both entrees were perfectly prepared.  We also had a side-dish of Brussel Sprouts which was so large that we could not finish.  To close the meal, we split the Chocolate Souffle which comes with Vanilla Ice Cream and a side of chocolate sauce.  The souffle had a nice even coloring and a perfect baked rise to it.  Magazine perfect presentation to the souffle.....apologies as I did not take a picture of it!  Overall, a very good dining experience in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a large casino.",

The potato chips that we ordered as appetizer is quite tasty and I am quite satisfied with my lamb skewers, tender and juicy. The food quality and quantity are both decent.  One thing disappointed me is we got charged by the sparkling water. It may sound confusing but I guarantee the waiter and waitress didn't mention one word about how they charge it for the entire time. So, here is the story: when they asked us what we wanna drink, we said just water, and they ask regular or sparkle, and my friend said sparkle. At that time we all thought sparkling water is for free because it's listed in the water option. We didn't realized  that they charge extra $18 for two bottles of water until we checked the bill later on! I don't think that's a legit way to make more sales! They should have asked us whether we need another bottle plus it's not free but they didn't! So be careful folks! Just ask them \"Hey, I heard you charge for water...hmmm not sure if we need to pay extra $5 for ice?\"",

I actually liked my friend's pasta more than my entree but that was probably because I had wayyy too much mushroom pizza during my Vegas trip hehe; I was obsessed.

    "text": "We arrived at the MGM Grand late after a long travel day, we decided to eat here based on a few things, as I stated it was late, I didn't really feel like going outside the hotel and didn't really want to extend the day by a few more hours eating at one of the more exclusive restaurants inside the hotel. I've eaten at several of Wolfgang's Restaurants around the country and I rate them all the same \"predictable\" don't confuse this with anything negative these restaurants are just a safe choice but not outstanding for the prices in my opinion.  We were very happy to see although they were quite busy we were seated immediately, after a few minutes our server arrived he was friendly enough and explained the specials and quickly got our drink orders  THEN THE WAIT BEGAN!  It was apparent that the kitchen was backed up for this hour of the evening but then again it's Vegas, our server did make it back to our table periodically to assure us our food would arrive at some point, then he returned and told us the burger I ordered was very popular and the grill could only accommodate just so many, then he returned  to tell us that no matter how long it takes the chef ( I was thinking short order cook) never rushed any orders to ensure each burger was handcrafted and magnificent. At this point I really didn't care and wish I had made a run to In N Out.  After more than 45 minute from placing our order the kitchen delivered our meal the $17 burger was beautiful but slightly well done so I was slightly disappointed since I ordered it medium rare but it appeared to be \"well crafted\" I guess, this 1/2 pound of ground prime beef topped with fresh crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, pickles, onions and spicy mayo all stacked on a fresh pretzel bun had the making of something special but it was a little over-cooked. The server offered to fix it but it was much to late even though he said it would take only a few minutes I wondered how could this be the burger in front of me took almost an hour. The fries that accompanied the burger were delicious and served hot. Would I try them again I don't know there of lots of restaurants in Vegas so the three star are really related to the service mainly the kitchen service maybe it was a bad night at Pucks.",

I started with the Caesar's salad. While it was good, I would have liked the traditional white anchovies in the salad, instead of just dressing, croutons, and Parmesan cheese.   I ordered the braised short ribs for my entree, and it did not disappoint. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the accompanying polenta was creamy and flavorful.",

Wolfgang Puck's gets kudos for an extensive gluten-free menu, convenience, and great customer service.  You're not going to find exquisite delicacies here. You're going to find standard American fare but done really well. I'm a fan of the gluten-free pizza. The prices are about what you'd expect for a named-chef restaurant on The Strip, but if you play MyVegas online, there's usually some sort of a meal discount you can snag from there.  The restaurant has an open layout, so you're going to be able to see the casino floor and Ka theater from wherever you sit in the restaurant. DINE HERE BEFORE THE SHOW GETS OUT. There's a huge rush afterward. Mid-late afternoon has always been a great time to get a meal here in my experience, and you can also eat late night.",

Since it sits inside the casino floor, there is not much to look at. Glad they have bar seating for us solo diners and have I think one or two tv's.   I like sitting in the bar so you can interact with the bartender, instead of looking all alone sitting in a table by yourself. Maybe it's just me.   The food I give high marks. I got the truffle chips smothered in blue cheese and boy it sure hit the spot. The star was my fra diavolo with Seafood. I asked for non spicy sauce and it was done per my request. The pasta was truly al dente and the amount of seafood had me so full.   The pizzas look good. Big enough to feed two or three easily. They are not individual sized.   Overall, left this place very full and very satisfied. Time to walk this meal off!",

Relyn, was great; she was courteous & attentive.  We ordered the Shrimp Pesto Pizza and one cocktail to split.  The pizza was freshly made and tasted great.  The pizza contained a lot of large shrimp, not the small ones and the pesto was just right.  Total for the meal was $42.22, not including tip.  I recommend Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill inside the MGM Hotel.  This is my analysis and I have not been paid or coached to write this review.",

The burger was just alright, nothing special and not a lot of flavor. I think the cook is allergic to salt or something. The pizza was super greasy but other than that it tasted good. The only thing we actually enjoyed were the crab cakes, those were really good. I'm guessing we came on an off night because they have pretty good reviews and we've been to other Wolfgang restaurants that were delicious. But, tonight was definitely an upset.",

There was a bunch of people so we figured we might as well check it out.  I got the prime grill burger which was pretty good. The meat patty was pretty flavorful and tasty. Not really a fan of the puffy buns since it didn't really taste like much and was pretty much just a source of carbs. The lettuce and tomatoes were nothing special. The fries could have used some work since it was pretty soggy for the most part. If I'm going to pay more than $20 for a burger and fries, at least give me crispy fries lol. The rigatoni was okay, but the meat sauce portion was pretty skimpy. The dish looked like it was only worth $10 but of course it was more than twice that. Not sure what was so special about it. Also tried the spaghetti and meatballs which was average as well.  Service was not that great as well. Our waitress didn't really check up on my table and I literally had to tag someone else for water refills and to ask for more ketchup. Getting the bill also took a while and luckily we were not in a rush.  Overall I would not come back to this establishment. It's one of those tourist traps that y'all should avoid. The meals you get here can be easily gotten for cheaper at another place like Bucca di Beppo. The portion sizes are also pretty small for the price you pay. The flavor department is also lacking for the most part.",

Blue cheese chips seem to be a hit here.. it's too bad I don't like blue cheese. it's an open space restaurant where you can see the rest of the casino... it's separated with colorful panels... design was impressive. When it comes to the food, we got the veggie pizza, the calamari fritti and the best thing we ordered was probably the Caesars salad. We left out the anchovies and it was just perfect. Service was fast enough. good crowd. overall pretty good experience.",

For an appetizer we had cheese fries with wild boar meat and a fried egg (recommended app of the day). Chocolate Souffle for dessert and that was my favorite thing and I am not a huge chocolate fan. The service was so-so.",

    "text": "After an early evening arrival in Vegas on Friday, we wanted a relaxed place with good food without going over the top (Had Michael Minna's StripSteak and Bouchon booked for the following two nights).  This place was fine for that purpose.  It is on the casino floor so there is quite a lot of noise, but it didnt detract from the exprience.  My Dad had the burger which tasted great and I had the scallops, seared to perfection and very tender.  My wife had the shrimp risotto which was nice, although a little too rich for her taste.  Mum had the Halibut I think, I cant remember, so it wasn't anything mind blowing.  Wine list was good but not overwhelming, so easy to choose a couple of good ones.  The server was knowledgeable and did help out (which is good because I dont think they had a Sommelier!).  We ordered the Bonaccorsi Pinot Noir which was reasonably priced for wine... and more to the point, for wine in vegas.  (Different experience at StripSteak I can tell you!).   All in all, exactly what I expected for the food and the price to match.",

I should have gotten up and left but the waitress was nice and said they would come the whole meal and get me a new pizza. After waiting for the new pizza, already losing my appetite, I ate a slice and got the rest to go.  Before the check arrives the manager come to our table (I thought just to apologize about the food) and says he's sorry but the waitress miss spoke and only that pizza was getting comped.

My husband ordered a dessert, the brownie sundae, which was the saddest thing ever. My souffle on the other hand was amazing!  Half of our dishes got bussed and a waiter never returned to get more drinks. My husband had a soda and had to ask for refills. We never got water refilled.  We all tipped almost nothing - which is unusual, but this service was terrible. The worst service we have ever had.

Tips: - We ordered the ribeye and told them we would be sharing. They will split everything (vegetables, steak, etc.) for you without an additional cost. Nicer restaurants typically do this for their customers, but some will charge a fee.  - My dad asked for Tabasco sauce with his pasta (I know, kinda weird), and they gave us a handful of cute travel-size Tabasco bottles to use and take home with us.

I ordered the crab cakes and the antipasti plate. The crab cakes were delicious! Full of nice chunks of crab and it went perfectly with the fresh basil aioli it came with. The antipasti plate was very good, great selection of cured meats. The prosciutto and salami were spectacular and so was the fresh BURRATA!  This plate also came with some marinated vegetables and some grilled bread. It all went very well together. My only complaint is that they only give you 3 slices of grilled bread for the whole plate of antipasti, the meat to bread ratio was a little off. My boyfriend got the Prime Burger and i had a bite, it was soooo good! The meat was cooked perfectly and the condiments it came with made it even better, I especially liked the coleslaw the put in the burger. We will definitely be back, they also have a late night menu that would be worth checking out.",

And it's not the one-too-many-drinks talkin'. A better alternative to the McDs or chinese options offered in the food court.   So my latest order was the wood oven roasted mushrooms, asparagus, leeks, thyme, taleggio. A nice big pie, thinking i won't be able to finish it, but then I look back at the plate and it's empty. I really like this pizza, nice combination, and the ingredients are well prepared. Score!  The serving size was good, price is a tad high but just about worth it. Plus the service was friendly and attentive. On the border, deserving 4 stars.",

    "text": "I stayed at the MGM Grand for the 2015 Splunk conference. I came here twice. The first time, I just came for a couple of margaritas. The second time, I had some Old Fashioneds and a pasta dish.  The service was good both times. I was provided with plenty of water, and my drink level was maintained.  I appreciated the good selection of food on the menu. I heard a message on the resort sound system that said the restaurant had a special late night menu, but the one I got seemed pretty complete to me.  The pasta dish (the tortillini) was tasty. I think it was the most standout food I've had in Vegas, and I've tried several places. I ordered the dish late at night, about 1 AM. It came within 15 minutes. The margaritas and the Old Fashioneds were consistent, poured \"heavy handed\", and did the job. I got the Old Fashioneds made with their house blend of bourbon, and it was good.  Overall, I feel that Wolfgang Puck really delivered. I didn't walk in here expecting food or drinks that exceeded that which I am used to in my hometown, consistent with what I have had in Vegas. But they offered consistent service levels, and I really enjoyed my food. I would recommend this place, especially for people looking for a late night munch while gambling or otherwise enjoying the MGM resort. Responsive, friendly service, and a good bite to eat. Drink prices are spendy, but consistent with other offerings in the resort. I spent about 90 dollars on the meal and four drinks, before tip.",

When making the reservation, the hostess asked us if we were celebrating anything. I informed her that we were celebrating our 3 year anniversary and that we were in a long distance relationship.  When we were seated and brought our menus, I was so surprised. At the top of their menu, they had \"Happy 3rd Anniversary\" printed on the top. Yes it was something small, but it meant a lot to me. We both ordered the linguini pasta with shrimp and it was amazing. We ended with creme brulee for dessert and it was delicious.  The wait staff was great and we never had to really wait for anything to come to our table or for our drinks to be refreshed.  Thank you for making our anniversary dinner so great!!!",

    "text": "Wow what a surprise. I didn't expect to have such a great experience because we ate here just to kill time before catching the KA show, but I was proven otherwise. We did have to wait a little even with reservations but it wasn't too bad. One thing that didn't make sense is their layout, where people were literally standing around waiting for their tables around other diners who are eating at their tables. There wasn't really a good place to stand around to wait aside from around the other diners near the hostess desk, so either you go to the casino floor and play the slots machine or you go to the packed bar which you also need to be seated for.  But once we were taken to our table everything else went smoothly. The food was great. We had the fish of the day which was halibut over this creamy sweet corn sauce and the Grilled Salmon with artichoke puree accompanied by a delightful blood orange champagne and a drink we can't remember the name of but was some version of the mojito. We ended dinner with the most delicious banana and toffee cream pie with yummy toasty crust.  Service was a little slow but attentive. We understood that they were very busy. They also had this small wine cellar room which we saw an intimate wedding party mid-celebration. It was very romantic.  Last but not least, the restaurant is right across from the KA Theater. So conveniently for us we just had to stroll across to get to our show.",

This restaurant is also very convenient as we often stay at MGM, so it makes for a quick and easy bite to eat on our way out.   Anyways, I have tried the chicken soup (classic chicken soup with big chunks of chicken) and the spicy tuna tartare.  I have also had the french style omelet with Tuscan potatoes.  This meal makes for a great hangover meal when you are too late to catch breakfast.  But the real reason we keep coming back here is for the PIZZA!  Wolfgang knows his pizza and he certainly does it right!  We have tried probably every pizza he offers on his menu (I think about 5) and they are all stupendous!  I really enjoyed the mushrooms, leeks, and goat cheese and the hubby prefers the classic pepperoni!  The dinner menu is like an extension of the lunch menu, so I'm sure it makes for a fabulous dinner as well!    Love your pizzas Puck!",

I also like how their menu changes with the seasons. I remember the calamari being really good. As well as the pizzas and the rib eye steak. YUM. And of course, I really liked their drinks. They use real fresh peach puree for their Bellini's!   The only thing I didn't like was the openness of the restaurant. If seated near the sides, you could watch people on the slot machines while you eat. I also don't like it when people walk by and stare at you while you eat. Other than that, if you are seated in a nice area, its all good.",

We had celebrated two birthdays in their private dining room on two separate occasions and the service and food were incredible. My favorite items on their menu: glazed Asian-style chicken wings; fried calamari (probably the best I've ever had); the Vermont Cheddar Burger (top 3 burgers I have ever had). Their cocktails are unique and refreshing. The pineapple mojito I tried there is my favorite cocktail of all time. The only thing I imagine some people might not love is the openness of the space. It's not really a four-walled restaurant; there are illuminated floral panel screens that are approximately five-six feet in height that separate the raised restaurant from the casino floor. I've never had to wait for a table, the service has always been spot-on, and overall, this has become my favorite place to dine. Can't wait to go back in April!",

Liked the \"bar food\" variety on their menu so decided to give it a shot even though most entrees were priced at around $25, pizzas around $15 so not too bad. It's fenced off but open to the casino, which is nice. It was an upscale-casual vibe (if that's possible). The service was impeccable! Truly. Meatball pizza as an app was delicious and I've had some serious pizza in Chi-town and NYC. It took about 15 minutes to get the pizza, which we expected, but as soon as it came out the manager came right up to us, apologized for the delay on our pizza, and immediately told us that they would be buying us dessert (we were a group of 4). Not one of us knew what delay he spoke of, we just sort of froze at the mention of free dessert, which i'm not a big sweets person, but free is free. I had the steak skewers...UH-Amazing taste and texture. The garlic chili wings were good, but they seemed more teriyaki glazed to me. The truffle potato chips were great for blue cheese lovers. The short rib was fantastic as was the flat iron steak with fries. Oh, the fries were incredible. Hot and crispy, and stayed like that for a while. We decided to share two desserts in case they were too big. We were super stuffed because we had already ordered all of our food before we knew we would be getting the free dessert. We chose the banana banouffee(?) and the pineapple upsidedown dessert, both were topped wtih homemade ice creams and syrups. Believe me when I say that these desserts were the most amazing creations to ever hit my tounge. They were just beyond description! Yes, both of them! I've had so-called good desserts before at places like Ferrara's and Serendipity in NYC before, but those places were just generic, processed, super market ice cream compared to Wolfgang's creations. They really were unbelieveable. I cannot wait to go back to this place, and the great thing is that it stays open til about 6am I think! We paid about $200 for 4 people.",

Things I recommend - for appetizers, the tuna tartare. For entrees, the turkey meatloaf and calves liver (yes i'm a carnivore if you couldn't already tell, but both were really good). The calves liver sounds kinda gross, but it was actually a very tender cut, with fried onions and pancetta.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant as an alternative to the restaurants at the MGM Walkway (which are slightly pricier). More casual ambiance, but a great place for a quick bite and no wait for tables.",

It's clear that the staff are well trained and attentive. My wife ordered the salmon on a bed of spinach and tomato. I ordered fried calamari started, with the linguine & steamed clams in a white wine sauce for main course.  The calamari was prepared well, but some of calamari was rather tough - perhaps that is what should be expected when ordering seafood in the desert.  The linguine was very tasty and I would have that again - except that it seems the clams were not cleaned properly - some of them had sand in them. This makes the dish somewhat crunchy and you don't know whether there will be sand in the next bite.  My wife really enjoyed the salmon.  We enjoyed Wolfgang Puck. If the sand wasn't in the clams and the calamari was tender, I would have given this restaurant a 4 or 4.5 star (if that were possible).",

For the last 10 years, I have shared wonderful delicious meals with both my family and my girlfriend by enjoying the soft tender delicious chicken, the flavorful fettucini alfredo, and of course the crispy, tasty French fries that cannot be overlooked.  When I saw the sign of this restaurant at the early hours of 2AM in Vegas, I at first thought to myself, I must be drunk, this place cannot possibly exist here and be open at this time. Well on this Thursday night/Friday morning at 2AM, Wolfgang Puck was open for business! Me and my girlfriend were quickly seated at one of the tables with a several people around the restaurant enjoying a late snack. Unlike my previous experiences with Wolfgang Puck, this menu they provided was much fancier and lacking my usual orders. Seeing a to the complexity of the menu and not knowing what each selection contained, we played it safe and ordered a regular cheese pizza. Despite my ailing tummy and pulsating, painful headache, I managed to enjoy one slice of pizza. In the moment that I could taste the slice, it provoked thoughts about the good old Wolfgang Puck days in SF. I wish I could have had more pizza, but my body denied it. It was a nice to taste once again was Wolfgang puck meals were like and sad to see how this economic downturn we are still consenting has ruined places such as Wolfgang Puck.  The service was good, the single slice of cheese I had was great, and my hope for a new Wolfgang Puck in SF remains.",

    "text": "Great food! Attentive and accommodating service.  My boyfriend split a pizza with a friend of ours. -Roasted Chicken, House BBQ Sauce, Corn, Pasilla Peppers, Red Onions, and Cilantro Pizza. (great!!!)  My boyfriend also got: -Chinois Chicken Salad, Candied Peanuts, Crisp Wontons, Chinese Mustard Vinaigrette (so good! very fresh!)  I split a pasta dish with a friend. It was a delicious corn, chanterelle mushroom, and cheese ravioli with truffles.   Can't find the exact description online at the moment. FANTASTIC. I absolutely loved it. I couldn't think of anything I'd want to have changed with it as far as taste goes. Perfect.  I of course, would have liked a bigger portion. I did split it, but even if I hadn't, I would have wanted to eat a little more. The split portion was like a taste of an appetizer for me. Good thing the BF let me have a slice of pizza.    I find that the Pizzas are the best value here for lunch. $15 gets a nice medium sized pizza with incredible flavors and fresh ingredients.",

We ended up sharing a margarita pizza and a side of Mac and cheese. First of all the Mac and cheese was god like. It was the best I've ever had, and definitely worth the 12$. The pizza however lacked character, it wasn't bad or anything, but it was just very simple. I thought they would put some spice to it, or try to make it their own like many other places but it was very simple. It was good, but I was expecting more from it. I ordered a Rouge Mocha Porter which was great, but it was just above room temperature so it wasn't very refreshing. My girlfriend ordered a raspberry lemon drop and she enjoyed it, she described it \"good but strong\" which can be a good thing or a bad thing haha. Overall I would enjoy eating here again on my next visit, very close to the west wing too!",

Each of us ordered a drink, all of which were refreshing and delicious. Since we were staying at the signature and knew we would want leftovers, we also each ordered a pizza. We ended up sharing a chicken pizza, mushroom pizza, and prosciutto pizza. We housed the first few pieces before Aran packed it all up to go for us. The pizza was equally delicious (if not more so) as a late night snack. :)  Service was quick and friendly with the right amount of personality and follow up. Which is more than I can say for a lot of places in Vegas who sometimes come across as insincere.",

The bleu cheese chips are very heavy on the bleu cheese, so if you like bleu cheese, these are great ... if you are a marginal fan of bleu cheese, then the chips are still pretty good.  The calamari was good and the sauce was good, but I like mine a litter crispier.  The salmon was very tasty with potatoes and asparagus, but I would have liked more sauce.  The tortellini was also tasty but a bit al dente for our taste.  The desserts were awesome.  We dropped nearly $170 plus tip for that meal, so be prepared.  I would suggest trying Mesa Grill in Caesar's Palace for I think better food and about the same spendiness, if you only want to splurge once.",

    "text": "My husband works at MGM. We have tried a good amount of places there. I recently tried Wolfgang Pucks. I always pass it when I visit him, so I was curious.  I had the Truffle Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce to start off with. Oh my goodness! These have to be the most spectacular potato chips I have ever had. Then again, almost anything cooked with truffle is amazing.    I was told that the organic chicken was very good. And for my first time there, I always think a chicken dish is pretty safe and hard to ruin. It was quite good. It wasn't dry at all, and the skin was cooked just perfectly. I like the skin to be pretty crunchy.  It was served on top of garlic potato puree, honey glazed carrots, and spring peas.  Carrots were perfect. I like mine a bit undercooked to give it that crunch texture (If you want soft veggie, go eat baby food).  The potatoes were very good to my tasting, but I am not a potato connoisseur.    To top off dinner we shared the chocolate beignets. I was expecting the old fashion beignets (like the square ones from New Orleans at Cafe Du Monde). Of course, leave it to these chefs to re-invent them. These beignets were almost like donut holes, BUT BETTER! They are almost like the texture of chocolate souffle that is rolled into a ball. And inside this ball was core of yummy chocolate-ness.  To compliment it all, it was served with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce.   Service was decent. It was incredibly busy when we came, so I am not completely sure how they normally are. I would actually give a 2 1/2 -3 stars for service. But the potato chips and beignets make me want to give them four overall.",

I had a flat iron steak that was burnt on the outside, mostly well on the inside. Resembled beef jerky. No offence to beef jerky.  I had to flag down the waiter, Darren to have it done over. The second came out medium-well. Taste was horrible. A mound of blue cheese with some kind of sauce. I guess it was suppose to be demi. We also had a chenois salad. Bland other than the sesame oil. You might want to introduce your cooks to salt and pepper. All food was under seasoned. The chicken soup was fresh but again, no flavor. The bread was fresh. That was my dinner. I ordered an ice tea. Never received it. I had to ask for water. Twice. Even though two different servers came to our table to fix items. Darren spilled water on the table, never cleaned. It. This guy needs to be trained properly. He had way to many tables for his experience level. No manager in sight. No manager came over to apologize . Probably the main problem with service. We come to vegas several times a year. Won't be going to any joints with has the puck name.",

The ambience is very casual.. Staff is always super friendly. The wine list includes my favorite Riesling (yay!) however, you will run into some obnoxious intoxicated people.. But then again, it's Vegas and they are open til 6 am.   Do try: -wild mushroom fettuccine in light cream sauce and truffle oil  -flat iron steak with blue cheese butter -butter lettuce salad with white anchovies -all their flat bread pizzas  -white or red sangria -calamari  -caramelized Brussel sprouts  On Vegas prices, I feel like the food should be worth more. The flavors are wonderfully non complicated with simple seasoning. Do try this place. I guarantee you will be coming back.",

So all I could taste was onion.  So I told the waitress that the salad was over whelmed with onion and I couldn't eat it.  She had a attitude so I just decided not to reorder anything.  Then the manager came and try to fix the situation and offered me something else.  So I decided to get chicken noodle soup.  That's pretty basic it hard to mess up soup so I thought.  It was flavor less and there was veins threw out the chicken.   I was done at that point and grossed out.  You would think that a restaurant of that stature would make sure there food was Delicious.

    "text": "Stumbled across this place while on a business trip. Needed a place to eat that could accommodate a small party without a long wait as many from the group were hungry and tired.  The atmosphere was nice but unimpressive; partially because it is located inside of a casino with flashing lights and lots of noise, and partially because it is a small venue within a large casino and it felt a little crowded and claustrophobic. Regardless of the overall atmosphere our group received a great table, a little more private than the others, and next to the open kitchen.   The menu didn't seem to impressive at first; pizza, burgers, potato chips... seemed just like a regular bar. So why was the food for of pricey and what made this place so much better than a regular bar. It was the food! Who would of known that pizza didn't have to taste so average and that potato chips could be so outstanding.  I had to go back a few months later, for business again, and this time I brought my husband. Our first night in Vegas I insisted on returning to Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill specifically for the Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese - out of this world - and splurged on some dessert. Honestly I don't recall what my husband got but the Raspberry Chocolate Chip Souffle I got made me a fan of this Wolfgang Puck for life.  If I ever go to Vegas again I will definitely dine here; but what I really want is for Wolfgang to put one of his restaurants in Philadelphia so I can enjoy the chips and souffle anytime I want.",

The group I was with got more traditional pizza and seemed to like it although my mother's crab cakes were almost miniature in size and that was strange. Pizza-wise...

We also order a Chinese salad with small won strips. It's like CPK's Thail grilled chicken salad, but man oh man, this was by far the best Asian chicken salad I've tasted. It was well-marinated, chicken cooked perfectly, and rich flavors without no salty taste to it.   As for dessert we had Senca Green Tea & Orchid Oolong Tea, from Art of Tea. These are organic tea, and my goodness, it was very tasty & heavenly aromatic. Plus we order the banana-coffee cream pie with their house-made carmel maple syrup.

After I dropped off my luggage in the room I ran down to play some blackjack for an hour or so. At that point I was ravenous and needed a bite to eat. This casino is huge but many spots to eat at were already closed for the night. I wandered over to Wolfgang Puck and it was still open.   Open until 6 am so its a life saver when drunk and hangry!   Pretty decent cheeseburger here. Big and filling. Fries are shoestring style and just ok. A few craft beers on tap about six or so such as Full Sail Amber.  Plenty of seating surrounding the floor, and a nice bar area I sat at. The bartender on duty that night was attentive enough and got me my food and drink pretty quickly. Overall, no real complaints here, but a bit on the pricey side. It is in a casino after all. Not a bad spot to grab a meal, especially in the middle of the night when on a gambling bender.",

Our waiter came over immediately to take our drink orders (tap water) and informed us of the specials.  Complimentary bread (onion focaccia and Italian) and butter was served. The focaccia was excellent, Italian somewhat dry.  We opted to share the Asian Chicken Salad and the Sausage and spinach pizza. The Asian Chicken salad was excellent and they split the salad onto two plates (a nice/convenient touch) and was very filling.  Shortly after, the pizza came out and it was piping hot and very good.   A little hard to cut with our butter knives but very good.  A perfect amount of food for two.  Total tab with tip $43. Our first experience at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant and we'll be back!",

    "text": "So let me begin by saying the plethora of restaurants in Vegas can be super daunting. There are almost too many to weed through! We decided to grab a bite to eat on a Friday night - wanted something good but not too expensive. Landed here based on its Yelp rating and general price point.   EH.  For starters, the atmosphere is Vegas ... Like you can see the slots from the table so that's neither pro nor con, just note worthy.   The staff was pleasant. Very efficient hostess and super friendly waitress.   The food is what lost me. For starters, I actually had a kinda tough time choosing something to order. The menu kinda has variety but at the same time has a lot of similar items so if you aren't feeling a certain vibe you may find it limiting. Our issue was it sounded good but what we saw on nearby tables didn't look as great as it read. So we started out with Calamari, the man ordered the clam linguine and I ordered some mushroom pizza ... The calamari was pretty good!! Not the best I've had but definitely solid. It came with a spicy sauce that was great! The rest of our meals were very very mediocre. For the restaurant of a household name in cuisine I was very underwhelmed. Nothing was bad ... It was all just EH ... And for a $90 dinner for two in one of the dining capitals of the world I was very unimpressed.  Next trip I won't return here. It isn't bad but who wants \"eh\" in Vegas?! And it is overpriced for what you get. Go elsewhere.",

We asked the hostess what her favorites were currently which was the chicken wings and chicken milanese. So we ordered that and a pepperoni pizza.  The wings were $16 which was a little expensive, but they tasted amazing. They were lightly sweet with a Latin fish sauce and had chilies (which brought the entire dish together). 5/5  However, that was the only thing about the meal that was good.  The pizza came and when we tried taking a bite of it, the toppings (cheese and all) just slid off. Granted it was hot, but i do not prefer eating pizza with a fork and knife. 3/5  The chicken milanese was overcooked and dry. I have had chicken milanese before and it was flavorful. At WPB, it was lacking in seasoning, flavor and tenderness. The salad on top was overdressed and overly salty. I did try it together and it did not do it for me. I have a feeling instead of it being pan fried, it was deep fried by the dryness of it. 1/5  We didn't order cocktails, as there are places with more reasonable prices. I mean $17 for a muscow mule, which is: vodka, ginger beer and a little lime. We just went to whiskey down and had amazing whisky at that price.  I would say, get the wings and maybe some fries and then get out, not worth the price for the quality of the food.",

    "text": "Incredible.    Yeah the portions are smaller than most restaurants (who overfeed us anyway) but it is WORTH it.  My husband got the four cheese ravioli with meatballs and I ordered the White corn agnolotti with lobster and it was so delicious and unlike anything I had tasted before.  They were a delicate pasta with a hint of corn and truffles with tender pieces of lobster that melt in your mouth.    Absolutely mouth watering.  The bread the waiter brought was delightful, with an assortment of what I believe was French bread, sour dough, and a unique and tangy olive bread.    Not to mention the alluring atmosphere of a French street paired with \"street\" performers in the form of a flutist and violinist.  Very romantic and classy.  Wolfgang puck lives up to his hype with this winner of a restaurant.",

Margherita: Light crust, chewy and crispy at the same time, flavors were good but not great. Just your typical margherita pizza on a thin chewy/crispy crust.  Italian sausage: Hmm I liked that sausage. That's what she said. Great flavor on this one especially with the caramelized garlic and sharp pecorino romano cheese.   Must have: Blue cheese truffled potato chips. I fucking loathe blue cheese but oh man these are soooo good. Rich, creamy, savory, crunchy, buttery delicious.   Side note: They get an extra star for the panty dropping delicious potato chips.",

If you don't like mushrooms, which I don't, don't convince yourself that the mushroom pizza will have a little mushroom on it. Because it will come to you fully covered in mushrooms and you will not enjoy it. The crust was good, the pizza was generally oily.  This place is just alright. The prices are good compared to what else you have around.",

The chips with the sandwich are really bland, I left most of them.  Kind of disappointing when you're paying $15 for a sandwich lol.  Pork Sandwich - 5 Salad - 4 chips (with sandwich) - 1 Service - 2 Price - 1  The prices at MGM's restaurants seem out of control, even for the strip.  I live at an MGM property and i'd like to go more given that it's close, but even given that I can afford it I feel ripped off to a certain extent after every meal :(  If you want a good sandwich head to Earl Sandwich at Planet Hollywood and pay 1/3 the cost.",

It is also open very late which makes it the best choice in the hotel for dining after 10pm.  Apps: You HAVE to have the chicken soup - so fresh and tasty. I always start a meal with a bowl of the soup Chinese chicken salad is good too - large portion  Lunch: The lamb sandwich is amazing, don't pass it up Pizzas are also good and pretty large Burger is good  Dinner: The last 2 visits I had the Kobe beef special. It's a great deal, about $47 and steak is very tender. It also comes with (literally) a pound of potatoes and cauliflower on the side. Very large portion and vegetables are perfectly cooked. Probably the best Kobe beef deal in town. I had the salmon once and it is good The flat iron steak is pretty good The thin breaded chicken breast is nothing special, I would pass Spaghettini with tomato sauce is a great light dish, very fresh and flavorful and vegetarian.  Dessert: I believe I had the cobbler or fruit pie and it is very good and big enough for 2. They have good loose leaf tea selection. For lunch the fresh cookies are good too.  Complaints: Only real complaint is the service is hit or miss. If you eat at the bar, the bar tenders are nothing special but I once had a very good female bar tender that checked often on me and my meal.",

Mr. Robuchon was calling my name, but we had no money to pay for it this time :)  It was packed but we had reservations and were seated quickly.  It's sort of sitting out in the middle of the casino but covered separately.  Standard WP fare - salads, oven baked pizzas, Californian menu... we enjoyed our meal, but it's nothing to write home about.  The bread was okay - I enjoyed the olive bread in particular, but the rest was average.  We both had the Caesar salad with bruschetta to start, and I had the sausage pizza and my hubby had the gnocci.  The salads were decent, and the pizza was quite good - nice thin crust, non-greasy with the nice oven taste.  The gnocci did not have enough gnocci... there was a ton of the sauce left-over afterward.  I think the quality is fair for the price... it's mid-range for price and also for quality.",

She seemed very apathetic to us being seated in her section and kept asking for drink orders even though a few of us hadn't even had a chance to pass the drink menu around.  When it came time to order she just came by to see what we wanted with no explanation of the menu or specials.    I wasn't even aware of the specials until I heard a nearby table get a list from their waiter.  I ended up ordering the Grilled Chicken Skewers and Salt & Pepper Wings off the appetizer menu, and they were some of the best items I've ever had at a restaurant.  Overall, not a great experience, but the food made up for it.

The lobster pasta was really delish, it has a little kick to it.

For appetizers, my friends and I shared the Maryland Blue Crab Cakes. The dish came with four crab cakes and were stuffed with crab meat. They were also nicely presented and flavored.   For my main dish, I ordered the Sauteed Seabass with red pepper sauce, cauliflower rice, and vegetables. The fish was cooked perfectly. The fish was SO TENDER and the skin was super crisp. The sauce, rice, and vegetables added complementary flavors to the dish. One of my friends ordered the ribeye and was kind enough to let me have a sample. The ribeye was the best I've ever tried. It was beautiful, cooked just right, and flavorful.",

It's big so splitting was great.  Why I wasn't impressed with was the ingredients- iceberg lettuce with a bunch of other stuff mix in. Very ok. Server up charged avocado - we bit - it was $4.  Seriously!!!!  Entrees - so very, very disappointing, especially for the price.  Pepperoni pizza was excessively greasy AND it was $18.  The gnocchi was as $26...very tasty BUT portion was terrible given $26 price tag.  Salmon pizza and as excellent but was $29.  Chicken skewer appetizer was very minimal & had skin on.  Was $16.  Not impressed.    Had much higher expectations. Will not be back.",

    "text": "Came here twice during our Vegas trip -- once for dinner, and once at 4:00 am before our flight home. Both times I was so impressed with how good all the food was! They cook up some really unique flavors here with very quality ingredients. Servers are also very friendly, and they really go above and beyond to make your experience enjoyable.   My thoughts on the food:  Truffled Potato Chips w/ Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce: Ordered this appetizer since its the top highlight on Yelp, and was blown away by how delicious this was. The potato chips were thick cut, fresh, and pipping hot -- it paired perfectly with the creamy, tangy blue cheese sauce. I don't even like blue cheese but I'm in love with this dish! (5/5)    Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers: Very tender cuts of steak, thoroughly seasoned and covered w/ their house steak sauce. The dish comes with 5 decently sized skewers, but is a bit on the expensive side at $18. (4/5)   Garlic-Chili Glazed Chicken Wings: This dish definitely satisfied my chicken wing cravings! If you've ever tried Vietnamese chicken wings, these have a very familiar taste with the strong hints of garlic and chili. Each wing/leg was generously glazed and very flavorful! (5/5)   Prosciutto Pizza: Also ordered this dish as it was one of the top highlights on Yelp! My friends really enjoyed this pizza, but I thought the goat cheese was a bit too strong (albeit, I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese). Regardless, I still really liked this pizza because the prosciutto gave it a really rich, buttery flavor. (4/5)    Italian Sausage Pizza: LOVED this pizza! The contrast in flavors from the creamy ricotta, the sweet roasted peppers, and the juicy Italian sausage was perfection!! I might be a bit biased though because I pretty much devour anything with ricotta lol, but also the crust on both pizzas were cooked perfectly -- very thin and crispy.  (5/5)     Also wanted to mention that the complimentary french bread we got at dinner was amazingly good since it was freshly baked, hot out of the oven stuff! They also threw in some garlic/onion & rosemary infused bread sticks that were super buttery and moist. The french bread at 4 am was just so-so, but that's to be expected haha",

The best thing of the night was the bolognese. The pork chop is a huge portion but a tough piece of meat. The calamari was shit. There was more fried squash than calamari. The butternut squash ravioli was the smallest $26 portion I've ever seen. I had to ask my waiter for a lemon 3 times. The only thing that could make this dining experience worse is food poisoning.",

    "text": "Tricky Tricky Mr. Puck...  I stopped by to eat with some friends while staying at the MGM Grand. It is one of the more visually pleasing restaurants in the hotel. But Ah! Don't be fooled by the fancy shmancy set up.   The design/layout is what lures you in, but the food and service don't coincide with the \"ooh lala\" look and feel of the restaurant.  Roasted Chicken Pizza (Roasted Chicken, House BBQ Sauce, Corn, Pasilla Peppers, Red Onions, Cilantro): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=H5RWZB8RrQoK6RevxxDAzw&userid=B8CqppjOne8X4RSJ5KYOvQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> *I thought this pizza was good, but it wasn't above average. The crust was too hard for my taste and the BBQ sauce was overwhelming after awhile. I can usually fit about 3 (or 4 or even 5 on a good day) slices of pizza in my belly but I got tired after 1 and 1/2. That is so not like me. Even my boyfriend said, \"You don't want anymore?\" with a surprised look on his face. lol He knows I love me some pizza pie!  Apple PIe (Oatmeal Crumble, Cinnamon Ice Cream, Caramel Sauce): *The oatmeal crumble was a nice touch, but I didn't love the crust or the apple filling. I've had better. The cinnamon ice cream was good. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qSKv1xTclyWYmPZo2iylKg&userid=B8CqppjOne8X4RSJ5KYOvQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  The service is what really ruined the experience for me. We spent a lot of time waiting, especially for the food and for the check at the end of the meal. Our waitress wasn't very friendly either. It bothers me when waiters or waitresses just take their time dilly dallying like the rest of us don't have things to do. I needed to get ready for the David Copperfield show dammit! lol   Overall, not the best but it's okay.",

The skin comes out beautifully crispy, and the meat is so juicy and flavorful. Adding to the flavor is the Rosemary sauce that is served on the chicken. It truly is the best chicken I have eaten. It also comes with mashed potatoes and greens, both of which are good, but are overshadowed by the chicken.   My gf ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which were equally as good. The sauce is flavorful, and the meatballs were tender and juicy. Not to mention the pasta was perfectly cooked.   For dinner they serve bread; so crusty white bread and focaccia. The focaccia is my favorite as there are caramelized onions on top. For dessert we tried the creme brulee. There were tons of vanilla beans in the custard and a nice layer of sugar on top.   I tried some English breakfast tea to finish my meal, it was average but the most disappointing part was how expensive the tea was. In terms of value, most of the dishes were reasonably priced, and portions were enough to satisfy you.   With all these positive remarks, why just 4 stars? Service. The first two times we are here, the service was impeccable. The waiter was attentive and had good conversation. The busboys and servers were prompt and attentive. But the last time we went, our waitress was terrible. She was slow, only checked up on us once during the entire meal, and we had to chase her down to get our check. Other people in her area also had the same issues. While I wont hold this against the place for future visits, it did leave me a bit unhappy.   Minus half a star for the service we got last time, and another half star for the rip off tea.",

The place was packed, but service was still perfect...friendly, yet efficient. He got us through dinner and out without rushing us, but in plenty of time for our show. They even had a kid's menu, a relative rarity for the Strip.  The steak skewer appetizer had nicely charred yet tender and juicy hunks of steak with a refreshing slaw on the side. I had been dying to try the Chinese chicken salad, a signature dish from Wolfgang Puck's flagship Chinois on Main...considering the huge portion, it was surprisingly light and refreshing. The Prime burger was huge, juicy , and perfectly done. The accompanying fries were the equal of any frites we have ever had...what was really nice was that they were scorching hot. Chicken fingers for the little one were gobbled up. And the one fine dining entree we chose was delicious...a pan-crisped sea bass fillet nestled amongst Mediterranean veggies in a light, flavorful broth.   This place was a terrific choice for us, and will definitely be in our restaurant formation on our next trip!",

I am sure they make great drinks here and I would love to come back and get a drink that was made without a rush. I would also like to sit and enjoy it.

I ordered the vegetable salad to start and it was a large portion and really fresh! Then I ordered salmon and it came with a really great mixed zucchini vegetable and pine nut mix on the side. The salmon was cooked perfectly and seasoned really well, crispy on the outside. The wine prices are reasonable. The restaurant is very open, they have an open kitchen, and our table overlooked the casino which was great for people watching.",

Then we decided to look for Rainforest Cafe...but for whatever reason we got to Wolfgang Pucks first and decided to stop. We were hungry and tired of walking around.   I was hesitant because the Wolfgang Puck in LA that used to be on Sunset always had the worst food. Buying so glad I gave this place a chance.  I loved the decor and ambiance. The staff were all incredibly friendly and our waiter was great! I wish I could remember his name!   Also our food was sooo good!   Loved it! Will be back!!",

This did create a rather loud atmosphere, but also offered excellent people-watching opportunities (a Vegas must!)   My wife and I loved the truffle chip appetizer and we also enjoyed our Margherita Pizza, but the highlight was absolutely the Warm Vanilla Beignets for dessert. With Nutella and a banana filling, it is a must if you eat at Wolfgang Puck in MGM.",

Truffle potato chips smothered in blue cheese sauce. Heart-stoppingly delicious! Great pizzas. The manila clam and bacon spaghetti comes on a giant plate, and it's rich, creamy, full-bodied from the bacon. So good! I remember dessert being good the last time, but we didn't make it this time...too full!  Service was amazing. We had a 2-year-old at our table and our waiter instantly brought a mini fruit plate to keep her happy. Water glasses were always full, even when the place was packed for lunch.   I would definitely go back on our next Vegas trip!",

The tuna tartare was really good, definitely a must try. The black mussels was slightly salty and the toast with bearnaise didnt really work. Neither did the fries with bearnaise/ ketchup sauce. Actually, everything just tasted extremely salty that night, even the bread.  Since we were fans of mussels, we decided to give it another chance by coming here for lunch again. This time, the mussels were perfectly cooked (although the toast, fries and bearnaise still didnt work). We also ordered the crab cakes which were so amazing - this is how crab cakes should be done!! The grilled shrimps on the capellini were also pretty good.  The service, however, really needs some work. They were either too eager to clear our plates, or didnt bother to clear them at all. The waiters are slow, and it is extremely difficult to catch their eye.   I would come back not for the service, but for the appetisers and mussels and almost round the clock opening hours. Then again, I'm biased towards mussels. I'm giving this place a 3.5 stars, but am picking 3 for the crappy service.",

The waitstaff told me it would be a 40 minute wait for a pizza but it was more like 20 minutes (I guess they thought I would be pleasantly surprised and leave a bigger tip). The margherita pizza was pretty awful looking, the cheese has blended in with the sauce and it looked like pink paste on a crust. The mac and cheese was just alright. The shoestring french fries were probably the best part. If you're staying at the MGM Grand, I'd skip this place unless you are really drunk and hungry.",

But it IS in a casino at the MGM Grand  Kobe Beef  specials  CLEAN  Great vibe  TOTAL TURNOFFS  The wait staff acts like they work next door at Joel  Robuchon....one of the most expensive and highest rated in the US. The female staff is especially heavy on the attitude despite  most being eligible for most plain and homely.  Service is just BAD. Inaccurate orders. Orders sent to the wrong table and just shy of frenetic. And this is off peak.  Needs a makeover. The tumbleweed wreaths that adorn the elevated dining area are easy to spot....but the place has  not been spruced up in years.  I LOVE this place and have eaten great meals dozens of times.

    "text": "Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill (MGM) Las Vegas Strip, NV 10pm Tuesday 6th August 2013 Four Stars  I was very impressed by the food and service.  We were given water and bread upon sitting down.  There were three types of bread (Olive, Rustic, and Cheese).  The 2012 Elk Cove Pino Grigio from Willamette Valley had a definite crispness and acidity with a touch of sweetness.  The chopped Salad  had Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons, Tomatoes, Black Olives, Pickled Okra, and Creamy Greek Dressing.  It was light and refreshing and was not overpowered by the olives. The Spaghettini was simple but well executed.  The house-made al dente noodles acted a perfect vehicle for the plum tomato, basil, and garlic marinara sauce.  The Grilled Shrimp Capellini with Jumbo Shrimp was similarly delicious.  The Shrimps were a little over but the pasta and spicy sauce hit the spot.",

    "text": "Wish there was a half star because this wasn't quite four stars but it wasn't quite three either. Overall the service and food are good but was disappointed by the over salting of two dishes.   Also before we went downstairs we checked out the menu online and decided we were interested in ordering the pappardelle pasta with short rib and the roasted cauliflower side but was told the menu was old so of course the two items that we really wanted weren't available! Kind of a bummer a big hotel like MGM can't update the menus on their site. Not a huge deal but something to note if you're the type of person who likes to check out the menu online beforehand.  We started with the sweet chili wings that were really excellent, very crispy and the highlight of our whole meal.  We also had a half order of the maytag blue cheese chips which were tasty but not sure what the hype was about. The chips came out to us covered in so much sauce more than half the chips were soggy so we didn't even finish our half order.  I had the corn tortellini which seemed like a seasonal dish they added onto the pasta section and although the flavor was very good it was way too salty. The fiance had the spaghetti which was a huge portion enough for two to share. The meatballs were really great and very soft.  Since we are staying at MGM for a staycation we needed a restaurant that was kid friendly and overall this place is a good pick to keep it casual yet still have a decent meal. Not sure I would never return though as there are much better places to eat at that price point in MGM .",

It's always a good idea to call ahead just in case especially if you're a big party.   The service here is impeccable! The hostess showed grace under pressure.  She was taking reservations on the phone and at the same time, respectfully asking for my information. She seated us right away and our server came by to ask for our drink orders. The staffs know their menu well enough to make recommendations. I like restaurants that ensure that their people are well-trained and knowledgeable.   I have been here for business meetings a couple of times. I always order their pizzas. My favorite one by far is the Mushroom Pizza. I changed it up a bit and went for the Prosciutto Pizza today. It is delicious! I think you can never go wrong with any of their pizzas. For appetizers, I recommend the truffle blue cheese chips. They are addicting!   I would love to come back here and try their dinner menu. I think their excellent customer service and their wonderful drink selections are good reasons to come back.",

They had a \"cowboy menu\" for the rodeo, that included petit filet.  Their Tuna Tartare was really good.  Spaghetti and meatballs were really yummy, portion was huge, I think 7 meatballs!  you can share that plate for sure.  My daughter LOVED the gnocchi with sausage bolognese.  The wait staff was very attentive.  I was disappointed that the restaurant is actually \"in\" the casino, not walled off...so it was pretty smokey.  (yuck).  They also \"forgot\" that is was a special occasion, even tho I reminded them when we got there and didn't bring the candle...I had to go tell them and then they brought another dessert, it as was awkward.  :-(",

Took a bit of time to find this restaurant and required some assistance from MGM hotel staff. It's hidden in the back left corner of the casino.   We got seated immediately and our server/bussers was friendly and attentive.  When I stepped away to wash my hands after ordering, a busser immediately came over and folded my napkin into a fan (I was gone for less than 2 minutes!). My mom and I were impressed, this was definitely not what we expected from a bar and grill. Our water glasses were never more than half empty- and we were thirsty after a whole day of avoiding fluids since we were on a bus tour.   Our food was delicious and very hot. The Italian sausage pizza had the right amount of sausage and cheese. The truffled potatoe chips were amazing- it was essentially wiggle fries (often seen at carnivals) with a healthy amount of blue cheese sauce.   We both agreed we would definitely come back if we were in Vegas again. I'll absolutely make a note to try other Wolfgang establishments on the strip- next time!",

They offer some great complimentary fresh bread for a start as well. Sometimes I find myself eating here more than once when I visit Vegas.

It is literally directly in front of the entrance of KA and the food is great. We had the Mesquite Steak Skewers for an appetizer and they were phenomenal. My wife had a pizza and I had the Lasagna. Both were fantastic. We finished the night off with a Chocolate Souffle which we great. The service here is also top notch, Sarah, our server, and all of the staff were friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back. One of the coolest things we noticed is that everyone who works there welcomes you as your are coming in the restaurant and being seated.

    "text": "Asian-glazed chicken wings = 3.5/5 Flavor was good, nothing popping. Could have used a sprinkle of salt to enhance flavor.  Pea Soup with Truffle Oil and Morels = 4/5 I liked this dish.  It was pureed smooth and drizzled with truffle oil (and crema, i think) with a few morels in the middle.    Meatball Spagetti = 3.5/5 Eh.  If you're going to serve spagetti with meatballs it either better be in 3D or be really, really out of this world.  Most people can make a decent version at home so if you're going to pay $20, it better blow my mind.  It didn't.  NEXT!  Mussels in white wine with chorizo = 4/5 You get a LOT of mussels for $25 so it makes this dish worth it.  The flavor of the broth was good, cheesy bread was so-so, and the few chorizo slices act as an accent rather than a main ingredient.  The server had to empty my shell plate a couple times before I was done with all the mussels that I got, so if you like mussels this dish a good one.  Some friends ordered the ravioli and said it was really good, but I didn't try it, so I don't know.  =P  Overall - you need reservations if going during main business hours - service (ours at least) was pretty good - we told the server we were catching a show, food came out promptly - portions were a good size - appetizers were $10-15 and entrees $18-30.  So about $$ if ordering an entree and beverage and about $$$ if you're going for 3 courses.  So, overall.. good food, but but nothing special.  I agree with Jaye V. saying, I wouldn't put my name on it if I were Wolfgang.  =P",

The cheddar bread is delicious. I ordered the mussels, which was a heaping (at least 1.5 lbs) in a creamy, spicy red broth, with bread and homecut French fries...perfectly crisped. Everything tasted so fresh. My sister got goat cheese and spring pea manicotti. Waitstaff was very attentive, bringing heated washclothes at the end of the meal. Highly recommended.",

The service was efficient and warm with our server being quite a character. The steak main was cooked perfectly med rare with just the right amount of seasoning, and the charred crust was smoky and sublime. The accompanying potatoes would be one of the best roast taters I have had. The seasoned and crunchy shell to the moist and soft innards all made for a cracking side. The linguini also had well cooked proteins with a light sauce that didn't try to over power the prawns. Wolfgang has impressed us again with well cooked food and great service, what an easy way to fill the stomach before seeing David Copperfield! Food 8.5/10 service 9/10 decor 8/10",

Ordered the Truffled Potato Chips, the Wood Oven Roasted Mushroom and Spicy Sopressata Pizzas and finally for dessert, the Chocolate Souffle.   The chips were delicious.  Very flavorful and fatty.  A perfect late night snack.  The pizzas were large.  I wish we had known how big the pizzas were before we ordered them.  Because one can easily feed 2 people.  The pizzas tasted alright, nothing special really.  But really how often do you get bad pizza?  The souffle was super light.  And even though the pizzas were not finished off, the souffle sure was.    It was nice that there was a restaurant open that late that served up a wide variety of food.  Also the atmosphere, while being out in the middle of the casino, was modern and semi private.  Prices were a tad high, which is why I had to drop the rating down to 3 stars.",

Two of my friends shared the brussels sprouts with bacon and a pizza, and they very much enjoyed those. I shared the roasted sweet potato with kale and the chopped vegetable salad, with the creamy greek dressing swapped out for chinese mustard vinagrette, and both dishes were very good. I do enjoy how accommodating they are to dietary restrictions, by allowing us to swap the dressings, and also having an entire gluten-free menu. All in all, a pretty good place, but I would try something new if I were back in the city.",

The pasta dish was removed from the bill but still paid over $60 for 1 glass of wine, a salad and 4 half dollar size crab cakes. Hope everyone else has a better experience I think this place still may have potential.",

I tried a little bit of everyones entree at my table . I split the halibut, which I though was perfectly cooked and a good size for two to eat. my friends got seafood pasta, which perhaps could of had more cheese. another dish we tried was the leek soupe and classic calamari appetizers. :) overall a good dining experience, my only complaint is that its great for groups, but not very private or intimate being that there were no windows where we sat. you cohld pretty much catch conversations from random bystanders in the casino walking by.",

They had like a glaze and a lime flavoring to them. I'm sure i'm doing the actual description no justice, but they were amazing. Chicken wings are one of those items so common in every restaurant and bar, so I was like \"ehhh, these sound good\", and still expected them to be \"ehhh\", but they were more like \"whoaaa\".

Being a vegetarian it was easy for me to know what I wanted so I requested a ceasar salad with grilled salmon and the pasta with the seafood inside. I waited about 15 minutes before my food made its way to me. As I waited I sipped a mimosa. Ceasar salad was out first, it tasted really good although it was more of a serving for 2 and not 1. I wasn't even finished my Ceasar before my pasta came out. The waiter asked if I wanted him to hold it while I finished up my salad? I replied Yes. To make a long story short, I'm a detailed kind of girl. This was my first time at Wolfgang Puck at MGM and I was pleasantly satisfied. I honestly do believe you are in fact paying for the name but nonetheless if your name can rake in big bucks and everyone knew how to do it. Everyone would do it. Like I said, I will be back!",

Located inside MGM Grand, right across from KA theatre, it has a classy casual feel to it. Even though most of the dishes on the menu were pretty expensive for what they are, Wolfgang didn't disappoint. I had the crispy chicken sandwich and it was delicious or maybe I was super hungry hahaha! It cost $16, but it was a good size and it came with a potato salad on the side.",

The menu changes of late haven't been for the better and the quality and service is dropping with it. I know,the wait staff is hustling but messing up 3 things on one order without even as much as an apology? I have eaten here probably 50 times, it's a regular stop in Vegas because it has always been fast quality good food at a fair price, even more than fair compared to other places close by, but as the food quality dwindles and the food choices on the menu get worse (while at the same time continuing to remove some of the better things), there is little if no reason to go here anymore. There are just too many other choices that are better than where this place stands today. Hopefully they will get it together but I am not betting on it. Their light and tasty calamari has become a greasy mess, the pizza that was once well cooked and crisp looked like they were just in a rush to get it out of the oven. They used to have a nice shrimp and grits type,dish called shrimp Diablo, it was removed from the menu. I had virtually a ball of ginger in my chinois chicken salad which came un-split, though when we ordered it we said we were splitting it and they had always split it for us in the past. It's clear this is a place that doesn't care anymore so neither do I.",

My wife and I visited the MGM this past week and not being much for gambling, we went for the food and pools that Vegas has to offer. This place totally let me down. The only thing worse than the food was the service. The tuna tasted like it had been defrosted for a week or more. The waiter completely ignored us and I'd say all around the food just sucked for a better lack of words. Emril's Fish House was fantastic. Down the strip we ate at Guy Fieri's place and that was beyond excellent. Wolfgang's was one of the worst experiences that we've ever had. You could burn the heck out of my steak and I wouldn't return it, so it takes a lot for me to complain. Seriously. I would rather eat chips and a soda in my hotel room before going back to this eatery. This resturant served us low quality food, forgot our wine completely and still put it on the bill. If I was Wolfgang, I'd make changes right away, starting with a well trained staff. Go to any other resturant that the MGM has to offer is my strong recommendation.",

Actually CPK wins by a large margin.  And dont even get me started on the pushy waitress. Not only was she pushy, but she lied to us. She literally lied. She said (after we ordered) that it was going to take a long time to cook our food and that an appetizer would be a good idea.......then they brought out the complimentary bread! Had we known there was complimentary bread we wouldnt have ordered the appetizer!!! Which by the way was $16!!!   FYI, our food came out promptly. Literally 3 minutes after we ate the complimentary bread and the appetizer. Boo. What a waste. Our waitress was terrible and she earned her NO TIP. Never eating there again.",

    "text": "We came to Wolfgang Pucks on July 25th, 2015 to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of my two dearest friends. We were a party of five, not a large party but it was not the norm. We had several needs that required special attention and accommodation. One of our guests was using a wheelchair for an injury so we required a larger area for him to maneuver around during the meal and we brought with us two bottles of our own champagne to toast the Anniversary couple. We had inquired earlier in the day about a possible corking fee for the champagne and our hotel made the reservation for us via the hotel Concierge. We made our way from our hotel to the restaurant, and from the minute we entered we treated like celebrities. Our waiter was named Robert and I can say, without a doubt, that this young man made the entire evening unforgettable. He shared with us a little about his family and his personality was so comforting and welcoming. The staff that worked alongside of Robert paid attention to every single detail. Robert made certain that our orders were correct. His staff working alongside of him made sure that water glasses were NEVER empty. Our champagne glasses will always FULL and our food was spectacular. Our bread baskets were always full too.  He did not miss a beat in his service. He knew the balance of helping his guests and also giving us time to enjoy our meal with our friends as we celebrated. He treated the Anniversary couple like royalty. He made sure they were noticed and recognized. He made certain the entire experience was completely enjoyable. Our appetizers were tasty and just as described on the menu. Our entrees were served hot and to point. No long wait either. As soon as our dinner was complete, Robert came out with two special desserts for the anniversary couple giving them the spotlight. and makingit a night to remember. I can't express strongly enough how spectacular his service was. Robert was sincere, attentive and his personality was so memorable that we , as an entire group, will never forget him. We came visiting from Los Angeles with no expectations at all but he exceeded every goal of great service. Not only that but Robert also took it upon himself to discount a portion of our meals in celebration of the Anniversary couple's special day, as well as comping us the corkage fee. Who does that? If you want a great meal -- and the food was SPECTACULAR so thank you to the chef -- and exemplary service and an all around enjoyable dining experience then make your way to this location. It is an experience you will not regret. I want to take the time to thank the entire staff at Wolfgang Pucks for their hard work and dedication to us, the customers.  We felt like we were family and even better, we felt like we were VIP's from the way we were treated. I come to Las Vegas usually every year and I have been quite a few times over the years and have NEVER experienced such GREAT service from any restaurant or it's staff. This was beyond belief. It's been a couple of weeks and people I talk to are almost tired of hearing me speak on how great this place is. Thank you again for making this a night of all nights and one hell of an unforgettable experience. Robert, thank you so much for all you did to make this night special for my friends anniversary but most of all thanks for sharing a little of yourself with us. It was a pleasure. And to the management of Wolfgang Puck's, don't let Robert get away. He is a treasure you should value because service like that is RARE!!!! Great place, great food and GREAT experience.",

This place is awesome! Great spot to people watch, have some yummy cocktails and the food, oh the food is to die for!   Per usual when in Vegas you tend to need food around 1a.m.-ish, we wondered over to the MGM and came across this gem of the strip. The restaurant has a very open hip contemporary feel. I wasn't able to have a drink as my hangover from hell wouldn't allow it, but the cosmo and other fruity concoction at the table next to us looked great! (Props to Georgeann G. for ordering a glass of wine!)   I ordered the Spaghetti with meatballs..... probably the best I have ever had. The meat balls had chunks of garlic in them and the pasta was cooked just perfectly, not too raw or over done, perfect. Everything else that hit the table while we were there was great as well. I highly recommend this place!!!   Enjoy! Viva Las Vegas!",

Its rather funk and modern with a pretty wide array of cuisine, very likeable....I always am a bit concerned with these multiple celebrity chef restaurants.    After all , Wolfgang Puck cant be everywhere  But he must have a good chef at the namesake bar and grill.  I had the chicken soup, not as good as Grandmas, but darn close.  Since I was not starving, I also had the salad.  It was very likeable with many colors, textures and a very tasty dressing  My friend loved his steak, but then again baste anything in butter and it wil be enjoyable.  I never met Mr Puck, but he must have great standards, partners and processes....because I never have had a bad meal",

Wolfgang was the only option in the MGM past 11pm. The looks of this place kind of puts you off. There are these huge ring things around the front of it. Despite the daunting looks of this place the staff was pretty nice and they were BUSY. One of the many thing I love about Vegas.... that it can feel like its noon at 1am in the morning.  I got the Mushroom, Talleggio & Leeks pizza. Which was just what the doctor ordered for my post midnight hunger pains. But they put raw leeks on the pizza. I think the heat from the pizza is supposed to cook the leeks. But they put so many on that the sheer heat of the pizza couldn't cook all of them. Raw leeks not my favorite thing to eat.   Server took a really long time bringing me my drink. I almost canceled but I needed a little whiskey (I'm a whiskey girl through and through). I got the Makers Mark + Peach drink. Which quite frankly was the best idea EVER! Peaches and whiskey what more can you ask for? Giving 2 stars  because the menu is overpriced and service was slow + raw leeks. With all the culinary delights in Vegas I don't think I would come back here.",

Haha, but in all seriousness the chicken wings are perfect. A delicious sauce and slight crunch, yet perfectly tender. I've been scarred for life - all other chicken wings pale in comparison.  Now, the Kobe burger...it's like butta. Juicy, tasty, mouthwatering good. It's not very big, but it so filling. The boy and I always have to split it in two.   The last time I was there I also got the pumpkin ravioli...I think.... Well, obviously it was forgettable and not amazing. I do recall it being good, but it might as well have tasted like cardboard alongside the wings and burger.  I would like to say that the last time we were here the service was lacking to say the least. It wasn't particularly crowded at that time yet our server was nowhere to be found for a good 5+ minutes. Hello?! Maybe they were understaffed because I looked around and another group that had been seated nearby also had confused looks on their faces and no water or utensils in front of them.   So, that's my two-cents. Enjoy, Yelper's!",

First off,  I ordered a pizza and the pizza was HUGE and it was sooo delicious! I could only eat half and was sad to not be able to bring home the other half since we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room. What a waste! I hate wasting food! I should have totally shared. The prices of the pizza was around $15 but it's pretty darn big and yummy. WAY better than CPK which is roughly around the same price and yet a tad smaller.  But the worst thing about this place is its service! We waited a long long time until they finally took our order and waited over 40 minutes until our food was finally cooked. It was an insane amount of time. This was on a Tuesday night! It wasn't even a weekend but I guess they were still busy. But I still personally feel waiting nearly an hour is just absurd and retarded. They did take one of our meals off because we complained but it was just the $8 soup taken out. They should have given us 50% off the whole bill since we waited so very long.  So next time you come here. Share the pizza and enjoy it! It's delicious and I might come back just for that but as long as you know the service can possibly suck, just either accept it or don't come here at all.",

After almost 25 minutes (we were already done eating) the manager strolls by us, barely even acknowledging us, so rude and says he'll take care of our drinks and walks away. Didn't apologize or seem the least bit concerned that we were unhappy with our food. As the manager of a restaurant you should be friendly and attentive, we got none of that.

All had their drinks and bread on the table and had ordered their dinner before we were even asked for drink orders.  We sat with menus to the side ready to order for 15 minutes while our server stood across the restaurant from us and talked with another server. My husband started with chicken soup. The veggies in it were crips and fresh but the soup was rather bland.  I ordered the salmon with fingerling potatoes and spring peas and a stone ground mustard sauce.  The salmon was to be cooked to medium.  The salmon arrived and was served on a plate full of frozen peas and carrots and there were 3 halves of fingerling potatoes on the plate.  I have seen ahi tuna filets cooked more than my salmon was.  Only the outer 1/8th inch of the flash was cooked, the rest was Luke warm at best and totally raw.  There was a wait assistant near our table filling water for us and others and he checked with us right after our food was dropped and asked if we needed anything else he was polite and friendly.  Our waiter stopped by about 5 minutes later and didn't actually ask how things were just said \" things are good here, ya?\" and walked away.  Over all I was totally disappointed with the experience.  I have had better food and service at Applebees (which is total garbage)",

They accomodated our party, inquired about food allergies, time constraints, and whether or not we were celebrating a special occasion. We arrived earlier than expected for our reservation and were seated immediately. The service was superb and we never had to request a refill on our drinks. We ordered the Truffled Potato Chips, Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce as an appetizer and they were superb (if you are on a diet, this is not the dish for you). For entrees, we ordered the Grilled Prime Burger, Vermont Cheddar Cheese, Smoked Onion Marmalade* (no onions), which was amazing. The waitress warned us that it would be a 25 minute wait for the burger because they are prepared to order and it was TOTALLY worth it. The meat was cooked perfectly, the bread had a sweet taste, and the fries were perfectly crispy. We also ordered the Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese Pizza. DELICIOUS is an understatement! This pizza is definitely big enough to share either as an appetizer or entree.",

    "text": "Wolfgang Puck's restaurants hold a special place in my heart...the first really nice and delicious meal I had when I moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Vegas, was at Spago in Caesar's Palace.  I was homesick and lonely and apparenly, In the right place at that time, everything was superb.  After that,  I discovered Postrio (in the Venetian), which served up the most incredible Lobster Sandwich I EVER tasted!  Unfortunately, Postrio closed and the Lobster sandwich disappeared with it!  If anyone who works for WP in Vegas can tell me if any of the other venues serve that amazing sandwich, I will be there,  tail wagging and with friends! Fast forward Sunday, February 24, 2019,  I made a reservation at Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grille in the MGM for my friend, her husband  and another couple visiting for Laura's birthday.  Everything we ordered was wonderful!!  Here's a list of what we tried and LOVED!  The passionfruit mojito,  the Maryland crab cakes, the big eye tuna tartare, the mesquite grilled skewers, the roasted beet salad with goat cheese, the Italian chopped salad, the snapper (\"dinner special\"Ah-mazing), 12 oz. NY strip (one couple shared this), roasted Brussels (best I've had, sweet and savory) and roasted potatoes!  For dessert, everything we tasted were so worth the extra calories!  The chocolate cake with ice cream,  the creme brulee,  the beignets which reminded me of churros and the apple tart with ice cream!  While  All the desserts satisfied our sweet spot, my favorite was the creme brulee and the chocolate cake! What pairs well with great food?  Great service, of course, and it was!  Aubrey was prompt, professional, had a great sense of humor and took extra special care of us.  The manager, Kane, was awesome too, he circulated and checked on the guests frequently ensuring the guests were having a positive dining experience!!! Thank you to all the staff you really made an impression on my friends and topped off my girlfriends birthday celebration!",

All of this was topped off by a brownie dessert with ice cream and toffee. All the while the drink selection and service was great. Made an incredible decision to eat here!!!",

Soups, Sandwiches, Pizza, Entrees, there's a ton to choose from.  Best appetizer - Truffle chips with blue cheese sauce. My recommendation is to ask for the sauce on the side. The chips tend to get soggy after a few minutes but overall super tasty.  Burger - also super yummy. The burger itself is very flavorful and the ingredients are fresh. The fries it comes with were so-so in my opinion. Presentation is fun but the fries were a touch cold and not super crispy.  Lobster Bisque - tried this simply because it sounded great...which it was pretty tasty but was expecting just a touch more flavor. The lobster was cooked well and there was quite a bit...not sure I would order again though.  All in all you can't really go wrong with anything you order. It has all tasted great, the staff and service are excellent.",

The chips are drizzled in truffle oil and blue cheese and curds, so satisfying! The steak was tender and served with a coleslaw so for the amount of food and the slaw it makes a really decent light bite. We ordered the white wine sangria which was very watered down and kind of flavourless unfortunately. The service was really great, both servers were very friendly and prompt in taking our order and the food came out fast. I'd say drinks aside (which they may water down all the booze here who knows) it was a really nice experience!",

    "text": "Coming off my less than satisfying meals at Nathan's and Pan Asian (granted, they're food court joints, but still!), I was in dire need of a \"real\" meal.  Unfortunately though, by the time I could grab dinner (10pm), my options were limited, especially since I wasn't in the mood to wander far.  Insert Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, whose namesake I'd long been curious about, but had never bothered trying.  But hey, if work is going to pay for it, why not?  Beyond my curiosity about Wolfgang Puck, coming here was also driven by how easy it was to grab a table, as well as their hours (11:30am to 6:00am?!).  Looking over the menu, several things caught my eye (they have appetizers, salads, pastas, pizzas, and a mix of entrees), but I wasn't quite sure what to get since I wasn't familiar with what their namesake is known for (as in dishes, not his multitude of restaurants).  -- ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS with Crispy Kale...$12 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wolfgang-puck-bar-and-grill-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=F0ijYEWTingrcT077Zbeqg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wolf...</a>) Not sure what to make of this one.  The sprouts and kale were fine and the bacon added a nice saltiness.  However, the bacon wasn't a pleasant surprise if you don't eat pork (it's not listed on the menu) and made the dish both greasy and a bit sweet (it might have had maple on it).  -- RIGATONI with Fennel Sausage Bolognese, Parmesan, and Italian Parsley...$26 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wolfgang-puck-bar-and-grill-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=RdAVp_Cwk0W6DhijCnqcTw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wolf...</a>) I would've been happy with something warm and comforting, but this was great!  The portion was quite fair and it tasted fantastic!  The pasta was well cooked and not overly sauced, but the bolognese was the star - not super sweet, well seasoned, and just a bit meaty.  Well worth ordering!  As far as service goes, it was pretty awesome, but still had one major flaw.  While the hostess and \"assistant\" servers were super friendly and helpful, my primary server was lacking on the latter.  Particularly when it came to answer questions about what they/Wolfgang Puck are known for; sorry, but, \"Uhh...depends on what you like\", \"he's good at everything he makes\", and \"pizzas seem popular\" don't really do much.  Other than my primary server, as well as that sprouts dish, my experience here was surprisingly satisfying.  I may not have had high expectations, but it was still a solid meal and I'd be happy to get the rigatoni again (or to try something new).  Though I may not go out of my way to come back, this is a good option to have late into the night!",

The hostess seated us right away, luckily there was no wait even though it looked to be very busy.   Our waiter was so nice and personable. We ordered the steak skewers, chinese chicken salad and the lobster and crab pasta. The steak skewers came out first and I was pleasantly surprised by how tender and delicious they were. The slaw that comes with it, pairs perfectly with them. If we were hungrier I'd probably order another. The chinese chicken salad which is a Wolfgang staple was yummy. The pasta was great as well. Our waters were consistently refilled by the assistant waiter/busboy which was awesome since we were dehydrated from walking around in the Vegas heat. They had excellent customer service here and we really felt welcomed. I highly recommend stopping by if you're looking for good food.",

The restaurant is seated beautifully in an open space with just enough decor for privacy and exclusivity. Our group quickly ordered from a variety of drinks that came out tasting like Christmas joy, arriving promptly after ordering. We ordered a bevy of appetizers including the Truffles Potato chips, Tuna Tartar, and Grilled Steak skewers. Once again everything arrived quickly and made for eye opening dining. Everything was presented beautifully with unique pronounced flavors. You could easily have gotten lost in the appetizers alone. For the main courses we ventured into steak territory with a Flat Iron steak, Filet Mignon, and New York strip. Once again each dish arrived quickly and as requested. To say these were some of the best cuts of meat ever tasted would be an understatement. Each was breath takingly delicious, with well thought out sides that mixed in unique flavors. With our buttons nearly popping off our pants we went in for dessert with a chocolate cake and a tasty tea to end the night. Fantastic service, servers, and amazing food makes this money well spent for a great dining experience.",

The bar was directly behind this woman and covered in reserved signs. Pointed out the reserved signs and she just repeated that you can't reserve at the bar it's all first come first served. Headed to the bar and asked the Barman if we could sit at the bar. He rudely said no, couldn't we see the seats were reserved.   Staff offer unnecessarily rude service. Would rather spend my money elsewhere -  Vegas is full of bars and restaurants, just pick another one.",

Making a reservation with the hostess was seamless and although the myvegas rules are to print out the voucher in paper, they'll honor it as long as you can show them your code and activated the points at the mlife counter.   Food and drinks were wonderful, and the environment was great! Casual dining or a dressed up outing (we chose the latter) are all welcomed. We got the wild clam linguini and one of the sausage pizzas, along with a glass of Riesling and an old fashion. I LOVED the linguini, so flavorful and perfectly salty, which paired well with the Riesling. The pizza was great too, although I thought the crust was a little too thin to hold all the ingredients on top of it. The old fashion was really tasty as well.   I highly recommend trying this place out. Not too expensive and a great alternative to all those Vegas buffets.",

It's in the vicinity of the Ka Theater and decided to stop here for a quick dinner before the Cirque du Soleil \"Ka\" show.  Anyway, they were pretty busy the night we decided to stop and eat there but we chose to sit at the bar to get seated right away.  The prices were decent and the food was pretty good.  Our server wasn't too friendly but our food came out quickly. My favorite thing was the Truffled Potato Chips because they were fresh and covered with blue cheese sauce. I don't remember anything else I ate and that probably goes to show how great the rest of the food was. They have a good selection of beer on tap and is overall an OK place to stop for a bite to eat and have a few drinks.",

But Josh was quite possibly the WORST waiter I have had in my 43 years. We were lucky enough to get our check thrown at us without any thank you or have a good evening to say the least. Josh spoke in incomplete sentences in a quick manner as if we were burdening him. I honesty have never felt that way In a higher end resI have been a big fan of Wolfgang Puck since my teens and I was very excited to finally visit some of his restaurants. Josh ruined what was the beginning of a celebratory birthday before a concert. Other waiters seemed great and took time with their tables and even thanked people as they left.

The BBQ chips were crunchy and fresh.  Not oily at all.  Wish it came with more!   Ordered a pizza with Italian sausage, baby spinach, onions, chiles, mozzarella cheese.  It was really good and cheesy.  The pizzas are made in the front, and I could see the chef put it into the fire burning oven.  It came with 6 slices, super yummy.   Our server was very friendly and accommodating, the only thing is it took a long time for food to arrive.  Took about 40 minutes to arrive, as I watched the chef make dozens of pizzas.  He was the only one making the pizzas. Was starving by the time the food arrived.   Overall nice experience and made it even better with a bogo coupon! Next time I want to try this Chinese salad that everybody around us got.. It was a huge mountain of mixed/chopped salad.  Looked really good!!",

    "text": "We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.  I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.  I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal.   They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.  Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant.",

The chicken had no flavor, under seasoned and dry. I felt I could have just walked out and they wouldn't have noticed. 4 tables seated after use were served food before they took our order. Then the food took another 30 mins plus to arrive. Not a bad place, just lackluster service and bland food. And it wasn't even busy",

    "text": "Hmnn, well it's convenient so 4 stars there. I was proud of the host for getting us through a group that was intent on taking a selfie near the rose wall or pillar (whatever it is) right by the entrance.   Let's get right into the food. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with pine nuts + the blue cheese potato chips (or whatever they are called).   The chips were delicious, well worth $12 or so. Perfectly crisp chips with a generous amount of toppings and cheese. 9.1/10.  The ravioli, hmmnn, I'm not sure but I was a little thrown off bite by bite. There's balsamic in the dish but it's plated along with what I think is melted butter... sometimes you get a bite with too little and sometimes you'll get some with too much acidity. I'm conflicted of whether or not they should have garnished with the pine nuts or not as they sprinkle them in the middle... it's not too little that you ignore them but it's not so much that it's apparent it should be part of the dish. Overall the squash was really overpowered and also very minimal amount stuffed into them. I know because one fell apart and I saw how little came out. This dish I believe was $24 and I'll give it a 6.8/10  The server was really attentive until it came time for the bill, sat there for what seemed like an eternity although maybe he thought I wanted to enjoy my tea.   I didn't get water, actually, not only did I not get water but everyone around me got water and a refill; I eventually had to ask.   No spoon for my honey, which I thought was weird. I would have used the spoon that I got in my place setting but there wasn't one in there.   Not sure I would come back. I wouldn't mind it if it was on someones agenda based on location convenience but there are a hundred other places I'll go first.   The total for my bill after tip was $55. That includes hot team, the potato chips, and the pasta.",

    "text": "Very pleasant Vegan meal experience! Great food, great service, couldn't have had a more convenient location as it was in our hotel lobby!  No wait to be seating for dinner around 7 pm...nice. We decided to share a pizza since we saw other tables and they definitely were large enough to split. We also ordered a salad and they were nice enough to split it for us!  We saved 2 slices of pizza for midnight munchies...best idea ever!! It really hit the spot after a long night of walking, gambling, and (responsibly) drinking.  We also ordered 2 sangrias, one white, one red, both delicious. In the end, as far as prices for Wolfgang and Vegas go, not too bad. This meal will still cost you a pretty penny but you can do more damage at other Vegas sit-down restaurants.  If you need a quick but descent bite before a show (which was what we needed) then I highly recommend this place to you! There is a food court in the hotel but it feels very food-court-ey so beware for that. You are on vacation, enjoy!!",

The actual chicken piece was a good amount and tasted good.  The skinny bartender girl, didn't know how to make an old fashioned. She put sweet vermouth in it. I immediately noticed from the taste, asked if she could make it again without it, she said yes. It was the sweetest old fashioned I have ever had. I couldn't drink it. I didn't even bother asking for another drink.  Could have just asked how to make it, instead of trying to guess. Just saying.",

My husband and i were in vegas over the weekend , and we decided to eat at wolfgangs since it was right across from the cirque de sole show we were going to see.. we really wanted to love this place , simply because it was wolfgangs.  The food was super bland . My pasta noodles were hard and under cooked didnt have any flavor at all. The portions are really small also . It wasnt what i thought we would get out of wolfgang pucks place . You always think spectacular when you think wolfgangs , and it just wasnt spectacular at all !!! My husband had  chicken skewers and they were under flavored also . The garlic bread we ordered tasted like the frozen texas toast at Ralphs . Im sorry wolfgang but it just wasnt impressive !!!!!",

We were seated promptly and our server was there almost immediately to take our drink orders. The menu is not extensive, but that was a plus for me as we were in a bit of a rush. The prices seemed a bit steep (I mean $27 for spaghetti and meatballs?! Common!), but the portions were quite large and we all had trouble trying to finish our meals.  Food: Meatball Pizza--This is a very good sized pizza and I could only get through about half of it before I hit my limit. It was pretty good but there was a bit too much meat on it for my liking, especially for a thin crust pizza. Spicy Spaghetti and Meatballs-- This was pretty good, but for $27 I'd pass. Cheeseburger-- I haven't actually tried this but everyone on my table who ordered it had no leftovers so...it must have been aight.... Truffle Potato Chips with Blue Cheese sauce-- These are soooooo good! If you like blue cheese or cheese in general you'll love this! Oh how I wish I had some in front of me right now! French Fries-- Would I go back to a restaurant specifically to eat french fries? If they were Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill french fries, hell yeah! So good!  Service was quick and our drinks never ran low. Overall a pretty good pick.",

I had a pineapple-ginger mojito (really good!), the 3-cheese mac & cheese (very large portion, I could have eaten it as a meal, or it's a very good size to share) and the flat iron steak entree.  I really liked the 3 cheese mac & cheese, it comes with a cavatappi pasta, melted cheese, and breadcrumbs on top - although there was a minor implementation issue - it comes in a deep cast iron dish about 6\" x 3\" x 3\" or so.  The cheese on top was boiling when I got it... but there were a couple cold bites in the middle.  They weren't *hard* cold per se, just not fully heated.  Not enough to bother sending it back because other than that it was terrific, and there were probably only about 2 bites of the whole thing that were cold.  The flatiron steak was good too, it came with fries and a few green beans and had a wine sauce & a teensy bit of blue cheese butter.  I really only had one bite that tasted like blue cheese at all, would have liked a little more of that, but the steak had good flavor and the wine sauce actually worked really well to allow the fries to soak into.    Service at the bar was friendly, not as 'in-depth' as you're going to get at a table, but no complaints.  I am still trying to decide whether to go back there for my last lunch of the trip or whether to try Emeril's (which I ate at several years ago but not this trip)...decisions, decisions!",

So we were very pleased to have good food after midnight.  It's a fine dining experience with a casual spin. I saw people in jeans with their beers from outside bars, as well as suits and ties. The hostess pulled my chair out for me, and the server was spot on with timing.   We got the soup of the day \"Split Pea,\" it was yum. Also the mushroom pizza. Holy S. To die for. It had leeks, brocollini, fresh thyme and loads of salty tallegio. I tasted a hint of sweet over all the savory goodness and the server said they use a bit of honey in their dough - yep, that's it. SO GOOD.   I love love love this place. And honestly, it was one of the smaller dining bills we had in Vegas and probably the best food. GO HERE.",

    "text": "First, I want to note that this restaurant in MGM is not called Wolfgang Puck Express.   The real name is Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill! Someone made a mistake when starting this review thread...  So on to the food. I had a braised short rib dish served with some sort of pasta filled with cheese. There were also cooked mushrooms and spinach that came with the dish. It was very tasty. One of my friends had the skirt steak with fries, which also had great flavor.  The service was top notch and very attentive. Our water glasses were constantly being filled up. This is especially important in Vegas where the weather is very dry.  The dinner prices were very reasonable for a \"name brand\" restaurant. Most dishes were in the $18 - $30 range.  I had to take away one star because our table bread arrived cold. They gotta serve it warm to get five stars.",

The staff here are very friendly and go above and beyond to take care of their customers. Our waiter was attentive and even split our bills without us having to ask. The food came out very quickly which was great. The pizzas can be satisfyingly shared between two people. I am only deducting one star because the sangria we ordered was mainly ice in a pitcher and the ladies' restrooms had no toilet paper in either stalls. I had to bring some from the men's restroom for a friend.. Once I told a waiter, they were quick to restock. My friend also received a complimentary cake for her birthday. I will def be back the next time I am in Vegas.",

    "text": "Elevating a simple (and slightly old school) dish to something special definitely wins brownie points in my books, and that's what this place does well.  I had the Chinois salad with candied cashews, shredded chicken, cabbage, ginger and soy dressing (and normally wontons, but not for me), and while I was hoping (and expecting) it to be decent, it much surpassed my expectations. The presentation was stunning and the flavours all worked together beautifully. In addition, one of my fellow diners shared her truffled potato chips which was one of the most decadent and addictive things I've ever tried. Unreal. Finally, we shared the chocolate souffle for dessert, which was light and airy but also more than satisfied my sweet tooth. Everyone else was very happy with their dishes, especially the pizzas.  The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was sophisticated without being stuffy or pretentious. You are in the middle of the MGM casino but somehow the dividers and the atmosphere of the restaurant itself doesn't make you feel like you're among rows of slot machines and blackjack tables. For the quality of the food and the service, the price point is very reasonable. Definitely worth checking out on a future visit.",

The product is always consistent and wonderful.  I have tried the entire menu which consisted of amazing pasta dishes, fish specials, and great salads.  Just yesterday I lost the battery on my phone and they provided me with a portable iphone 5 charger at the table.  It's always the little things that make such a great experience.  I will continue to recommend the puck to all friends staying at MGM (breakfast, lunch, and dinner)",

This used to never happen, but on the last few trips, it's become a frequent occurrence. My friend ordered fettuccine shrimp scampi, and the fettuccine was undercooked. Still a decent restaurant, but now, the prices don't justify the quality imo.",

(and i have never buy a salad because i think its not worth the price, i can get something else for that price which is like around $5.) it has chopped Vegetables/ salad, Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons, Creamy Greek Dressing. my bf got the pizza with Italian Sausage, Roasted Peppers, Mushrooms, Smoked Ricotta, Onions, Parsley.  we waited about 5 - 10 minutes and then my salad came out and few minutes later the pizza came.   the salad is like the best salad i have ever had! love the tangy, sour and flavors of the vegetables. the pizza was absolutely bomb! it was flat and was packed with flavor. it was not greasy and i totally love the food here.  the second experience was great also... however, the salad did not bring back the same memories of when i first had it... i ate the whole salad the first time and the this time i just ate half of it. the bf had the mussels with sausage in a tomato sauce. the mussels were really good. they give you a good portion. the price is a bit pricey but totally worth it.  if im ever in Vegas... i will definitely come and eat here again and again.",

We just walked right in - there wasn't a wait, and there were plenty of tables. The drinks were expertly crafted. They have the BEST hurricane I've ever tasted. So smooth, so good. My aunt got the Raspberry lemon drop... three raspberry lemon drops, actually. The staff was beyond wonderful and even went out of their way to chat about the NFR showing on the TVs. The chicken noodle soup was the closest I've found to my mother's homemade, and the salmon I had for dinner was divine. It's a huge slab, so it was good for two meals. My aunt had a fantastic spicy shrimp dish and my uncle got a tender, juicy steak. For dessert, the creme brulee was heavenly. There wasn't a bad thing I tasted and the service was impeccable. I have absolutely nothing negative about it.",

This is a great group to have in Vegas, and I will definitely be back next time I'm there.  As a matter of fact, we loved it so much, this was the only place we really ate.  (Unless you count our liquid diet.)  ;)  The restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  I love the openness of it, with the colorful dividers.  A great way to showcase the dining room, but still let us see the casino.  The food was so good, but the item that really sticks out to me is the corn beef sandwich on pretzel bread.  Yes you read that correctly.  It was so good!  I asked for no cole slaw, so the sandwich was corn beef, melted cheese, and spicy mustard.  ON PRETZEL BREAD.  This is one of those rare food items that I don't even care about the caloric content.  I just want to shove it in my face!  The potato salad was excellent, and the pasta salad was fresh and summery, but filling enough to soak up some of those dangerous pool drinks.  Speaking of drinks, sample their sangria.  Strong, flavorful, and unique.   Five delicious stars!",

I ordered the steak skewere and they were well seasoned and tasty. The creamy slaw underneath was extremely fresh and delicious. My lady had the grilled salmon and she said it was the best meal she had in Vegas - I think that says it all as we stopped at a lot of great places during out trip.

It was yummy yummy!  Pork belly was tender and perfectly seasoned.  It was hard to eat and totally sucked when I had avocado and pork belly hanging out of my mouth when hot stache guy walked by.    My friends shared the vegetable chopped salad and a pizza.  They were stoked as well.   So 5 stars for eye candy + 6 thumbs up  = as many stars as yelp will allow me to give.

They might have been a little over priced, but I am sure getting fresh crab to a desert isn't the easiest.  But the highlight of the night was the gnocchi.

I suggest the Corned Beef Reuben with Sauerkraut and Swiss on Rye with Potato Salad for $15 if you want a good deli style sandwich. The Fish of the Day (Halibut) with Wild Mushrooms and Pearl Onions, Creamy Corn Puree and Tomato Fondue for $31 was also very good. For salads, I thought the Chopped Vegetable Salad with Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons and Creamy Greek Dressing was very good and can easily be shared with people as an appetizer.  The portions vary between the dishes. I thought the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel-Sausage Bolognese for $23 was a little on the small side compared to the Sweet Pea and Goat Cheese Filled Tortellini with Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Reggiano for $25. You also can't go wrong with the Grilled Prime Burger with Vermont Cheddar and Smoked Onion Marmalade for $18.   The Crab cakes were delicious, $17 for 4 crab cakes. When comparing Wolfgang Puck's prices to other MGM restaurants, this place is very reasonable and the servers provided excellent service both times I dined. Nice atmosphere too. I would go eat here again.",

The server said, \"you mean medium\".  I said, \"No..kinda towards the rare...I want it still pink inside\".  A different server brought it and said, \"Here's your rare burger\".  I said, \"Medium-rare?\". She answered, \"Sure\".  It was raw.  All the way raw. And so cold. But then I realized, my fries were cold too.  And my husband's food was cold.  I just couldn't eat it.  I waited until they came to clear it to say anything, but she picked it up and said, \"Oh....looks like you didn't enjoy this\" and walked away before I could say anything. So....weak service, weak bar, and cold/improperly prepared food (don't know if that is on the server or the cooks).",

    "text": "Disclaimer- This review only applies to the bar (no food was ordered)--went here while waiting to get into Ka at MGM.  Specialty cocktails are $10 a piece and have a lot of potential.  That being said, after trying two: The Flirtini (how could I resist?? I love Sex and the City!) and the Pear Drop, I was left disappointed.  Having bar-tended before using the free-pouring method, my bartender here consistently under-poured, despite the generous tips after every round.  Any martini (such as the two I ordered) should not have fruit/sweet n sour as its dominant flavor.  I would have loved to give more stars but when the drinks are weak, what can you say?   How about this: stick to their beer. They have Stella and Newcastle on draft, which alone should warrant a few stars!",

    "text": "During the extremely long day that started at home in Philadelphia and ended, finally, in Las Vegas meeting my best friend, I had been dreaming about martinis. Mmmmm, martinis. It had been a ridiculously long week and I really wanted to have a relaxing late-night dinner with some smooth, wonderful martinis. Ahhhh, martinis.  We ended up at Wolfgang Puck while wandering through the MGM Grand, so hungry that we were too delirious to make a real decision. Luckily, everything was fantastic. I had some of the best gnocchi ever - even the sausage in the sauce was good, and I don't even like sausage - and Jess had a hamburger, which she kindly gave me 1/4 of, and it was so yummy. For dessert, we split the chocolate souffle, which is easily enough to feed ten people and their horses.  But the martinis! Seriously! Everything I had been dreaming about and more. Jess tried something raspberry-ish that was quite tasty, but I had the pear, and it was EXACTLY LIKE BITING INTO A PEAR, except there was no biting involved. Just delightful, relaxing sipping. Thank you, Wolfgang Puck!",

I ordered some truffled potato chips covered with cheese, an order of fried chicken and I got an Oatmeal Stout and a few Doppel Bachs. The chips were really good and matched well with both choices of brews that were suggested. The fried chicken was very tasty with the right amount of crunch and yet still keeping plenty of juicyness in the chicken.  The 2nd visit we got the chips again, plus steak skewers and had the Doppel Bachs. The meat on the skewers were very tender and tasted pretty good but not anything mind blowing like the chips.   We actually went back 3x for the chips other than what i've mentioned above.",

    "text": "I give this place four stars for complimentary cookies and desserts. Yes, I'm serious. The chef giving our large group free dessert is awesome!  The restaurant is pretty standard trendy Vegas casino floor restaurant - open seating, a bar area, and a private room (which is where we sat, and was pretty cool since it was ensconced in glass). The staff was very friendly and brought us things in a fairly timely manner, and was good to us despite the guaranteed gratuity (since we were 15 or so strong).  The menu as someone else pointed out is standard Wolfgang Puck fare - pizzas, pasta dishes, a couple meat and fish dishes. The menu is almost like Postrio's. We ordered several pizzas for the appetizer and I had a slice of the tomato/burata mozarella/basil one - pretty good, the cheese was very gooey, and it was thin crust. I'm not a huge pizza fan, so it wasn't a big deal for me.  I must say though, I really liked the breads they brought out, with the soft room temperature butter. Mmm.  I ordered the chicken milanese for my main course, and it was huge. Instead of one chicken breast, it looked like four chicken breasts had been hammered thin, breaded, and fried. It was very delicious, along with the spinach/tomato salad. I was surprised that I liked this dish, seeing as how I usually don't like breaded chicken.  For dessert we had warm cookie plates that came with oatmeal raisin, almond tea cookies, chocolate brownie like biscotti, chocolate chip, and possibly some others. So good!! Also had chocolate brownie bar, which is a bar made with chocolate mousse and had a brownie bottom, with raspberries.   Overall, great place for a large group of people, and seemed to have something on the menu for everyone!",

I highly recommend the apple salad (huge), mac and cheese, prosciutto and pesto pizza and the Tuscan potatoes. I don't care too much about portion sizes so long as the food is good, but you get both here: wonderful flavors and generous servings.  My only real complaint: the atmosphere is a little strange. The restaurant is on a platform but there aren't any walls separating the restaurant from the rest of the casino, just railings, so you're right in the fray of the slot machines. That said, it's the ONLY drawback. Definitely worth giving this place a try.",

I don't know what they did to this BLT to make it take completely different and better than any I've ever tasted.  It comes with a delicious side of pasta salad that isn't over-dressed like a lot of other pasta salads.  I had the Ricotta Gnocchi which was like eating little clouds that just melted in your mouth. It's just enough to keep you satisfied, but leaving you craving for more when you're done.   I had a taste of my friend's artichoke pizza as well. Wolfgang really knows how to take the simple and make it extraordinary. Its the perfect place for lunch. The prices are affordable considering you're in Vegas. Its fancy but simple.

Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars.",

What stuck out to me about this restaurant was the service.  Everyone who worked there was superb at what they did.  The first time going I ordered the mushroom ravioli which was superb. The good experience that night was seemingly shared by everyone else in my party.  The second night we went it was still a great experience, however there were a couple of downsides.  I ordered the gnocchi and was told that I'd probably want to order something else with it because it's not enough food (despite being $30).  Another person at my table was told that their burger would take approximately 35-40 minutes if they wanted it cooked medium (which seemed a bit outrageous.). The food we received that night again was very good.  I elected to go with a salad and the gnocchi (which was tiny, so a big shout out goes to the waiter for being honest).  My friend elected not to go with the burger but enjoyed a soup and salad as well.  The bread they bring you before your meal is great too.  Overall factoring in price, taste, service and overall experience I'd rate this restaurant of Wolfgang Puck's a 4/5.",

It was the best salmon i've had. about $30 - Appetizer = Sausage Pizza was good. sausage wasn't too salty. good size as an appetizer.   Overall, everything was really good. Decently priced.

I will say, the price is up there though. I think it was 17 bucks for the pizza.  The dessert that I ordered was pretty good! I ordered a chocolate souffle that came with caramel ice cream. It takes about 12 minutes or so to make, so if you are in a rush, I don't recommend this. It was warm, creamy and delicious. :)",

    "text": "The last time I was there in August 2016, the food was AMAZING. Fast forward to April 2017, the food was so far from what I had last time. The only thing that remained consistent is the crab cakes. We tried the truffle potato chips with Point Reyes blue cheese sauce; it was good, slightly on the salty side, but still pretty bomb. I got the burrata cheese agnolotti and it was the saltiest thing I've ever tasted in my life. I was sooo hungry and I hate wasting food so I tried my best to finish, but I was dying. I was taking every bite with a mouthful of water AND wiping my tongue with a napkin in between bites. I ended up leaving almost half of the plate. The BF's spaghetti was okay, though they used linguine instead of spaghetti and the meatballs were mushy and tasteless. The sauce itself was decent, but the small portion and mediocre taste is not worth $26. I can't believe how different my 2 experiences are. The service was on point both times, so I give 2 stars. I don't think I'm ever going back; there are a lot of better options on the strip.",

There was no wait for table, and the setting was very nice. I wore leggings and felt very underdressed, but not too out of place.   Service was wonderful, and the food was excellent. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and my boyfriend got the linguine with shrimp. Everything was perfect, and probably the best pasta I've ever had.   Drinks were very good, and I was super happy to finally get a Moscow Mule in a copper mug! Everywhere I ordered it from never had the copper mug, but Wolfgang Puck didn't disappoint. My boyfriend ordered a Manhattan, and it was perfect. A lot of other bars we've been to tend to use cherries and tons of ice instead of orange peel with just one block of ice, but the bartender did it the right way here.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone. I think it beats a long buffet line with unsanitary people grabbing food with their hands from a hot tray any day.",

We ended up getting the Mac and Cheese to start off. It was rich and creamy. They also brought us a selection of breads. We were a little full and our food hadn't even come out yet.   The food came out and it looked amazing. My potatoes were a little salty or maybe I'm not used to it cooked like that, but it was still good. My steak was cooked just how I like it and green beans were perfect!! My friend got the chicken and she said it was ok, nothing special. She also said her mashed potatoes were a little salty as well.   Overall good service and good food.",

Service was unimpressive as our waitress seemed more interested in people watching than serving us.  We sent a message with her tip.  Lunch is going to cost you $20/person unless you share.  Skip the pizzas - very over-priced and very under-whelming.  Reminded us of a frozen pizza only $25!!  Sadly, the typical celebrity-chef chain restaurant.  Very confident that Wolfgang Puck would not eat here.  Paid a lot of $$$ for his name and got so-so food.  If you go, stick to the salads  as they are very good and close to being worth the price.  Stay away from the club sandwich and pizzas and drink water.  For the price of a beer, you can get 3 at the casino bar 20 yards away.",

There isn't anything special about the decor or ambiance.  Service: Our server was nice and friendly. Food came out quickly.  Food: Nothing special....this is where Wolfgang (consistently) falls short.  -- Vegetable Salad - just okay and a bit on the salty side. For $16 they could have at least thrown some avocado in it! -- Linguini with Shrimp - good flavor, especially the cherry tomatoes, but the shrimp was rubbery.  -- Chinese Chicken Salad - my cousin seemed to enjoy this, I didn't taste it.  Overall: I find Wolfgang Puck restaurants to be average in general and this particular one is no exception. We won't be returning.",

The food is amazingly delicious, which made my family and friends visiting this place come here twice during our 4 day vacation there! We couldn't get enough of it! The food can be a tad expensive, but its Vegas! Plus, its Wolfgang Puck. Definitely give the pizza choices there a try, as well as their pasta dishes. Think those two were what we loved the most about our experience there. I recommend the Italian Sausage, Creme Fraiche, Mozzarella, Red Onion, Fresno Chilies , Baby Spinach pizza, as well as the Linguine, Steamed Manila Clams, White Wine-Garlic Sauce, Tuscan Olive Oil Pasta. Those two were our favorite dishes.   Service was a little slow, despite it not being very busy during the time we were eating there, but the food definitely made up for it. Think our first waitress was training someone, and we did trouble our second waitress the next day a bit, so i can't really be mad at them about their service quality. They were still very polite in everything they did. They are also located in the MGM casino, so it was very convenient for us to come here and dine. Definitely is going to be one of my favorite spots to eat at in Vegas!!",

Pricing wasn't bad at all, casual style and cuisine.  CRAB CAKE APPETIZER: Four small cakes, didn't hold up too well, plated with a tasty creole mustard remoulade.   CHILI-GLAZED CHICKEN WINGS: Awkward pile of a portion, stacked like firewood on the plate. The wing I got looked like it came out of a lab and seemed to be a rib instead of a wing? Flavor of the glaze was light and wasn't spicy.   PIZZA: Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese Crust was amazing, prosciutto was high quality, cheese and pesto were delicious. Felt like the kalamata olives didn't work with the other ingredients, made the overall flavor profile too salty for my liking.   BEIGNETS: Large order of seven pieces, stuffed with a light lemon filling and served with a toffee-like dipping sauce. Flavors didn't work well together but pastry was light and well-constructed.  Service and setting were alright- tables are quite small and even with just three of us, drinks, and a limited number of orders, things were crammed onto the table with barely enough room.  Plates weren't cleared when they were empty but instead had to be picked up when the next dishes were brought out, either poor timing or a lack of attention.",

I've seen a few comments about the service, and it really wasn't all that great.

I would've expected the prices to be much more extreme but it wasn't! My gf and I shared the Pork Belly BLT. Honestly best BLT of my life. Forget the bacon because pork belly is a much better substitute. And the pork belly was a pretty thick slice in my sandwich! I love pork belly and get so annoyed when the slice is so thin where I can't even taste anything. So for the price point and the amount of meat I got... YES to this place!   The fries were addicting too! My other gf got the burger and the meat patty was super juicy! I liked how I could really taste the sharp cheese melted all over the burger. Yum! I'd come here again !",

I spent a while looking at the menu and finally ordered the Crispy Chicken Milanese (breaded) with a side of arugula and cherry tomato salad. The mustard sauce to pour over the chicken was yummy. The chicken was solid as well.  Although this dish was not entirely exciting to be eating in VEGAS BABY, it was a safe option. Like I said, it's open all night so when the options of places to eat goes down, I would say this is better than going to your standard 24 hr. hotel cafe.",

So during my stay at the MGM Grand we just had to try his restaurant on the casino floor.  The food was so delicious like always, everything tasted so fresh like it was just coming from the farm directly to our table. My wife loves the chicken wings appetizer and there is no other like the one we enjoyed here. I ordered the spicy tuna tartare and it paired amazingly with a glass of off-dry German Riesling. For main course we had the Jidori Chicken (the best chicken ever, in Japan they eat it sashimi style because it is so natural and organic and safe) and the Porcini crusted Scottish Salmon served with peas and smokey pork belly was also  phenomenal! My wife had a refreshing pomegranate margarita and she loved it. For dessert we enjoyed a really good creme brulee, nice crust and very good texture with a nice balance of sweetness.  They make very good cappuccinos here too.  Our server Kyra was very attentive and friendly without being too disruptive of our meal. She made us feel right at home.  We will certainly be back!",

We returned to this restaurant after a great experience four years ago, but this time it was very mediocre. The restaurant was extremely crowded, it felt like they've added more tables - packed in, and when you are on the edge of the restaurant it feels like you are eating in a casino. Our waiter was extremely casual and friendly but we barely saw him all evening. The food was not what you'd expect from Puck: Bland, basic. The pizza was flaccid. The steak was just OK. Maybe it's great for late hours eating in a casino but for a nice dinner with important people there are hundreds of better options in town. We got the feeling this place is on cruise control.",

Ive tried their potato puree and it is seriously addicting, I could eat just that as my meal.  I've tried their pizza which is tasty.

Service was very spotty, seems like no one manages front of house.  Atmosphere was..well,,it's in the middle of a casino - take a wild guess!  The server was raving about their pastas so I had the special - lobster ravioli - and my wife ordered grilled salmon with roasted corn salad.  Sounds great right?  Well, not so much.  My lobster ravioli was actually three (3!) cheese ravioli served with a bland \"lobster\" sauce and chewy bits of spiny lobster (langouste, actually as much a crawfish as a lobster).  The ravioli were chewy (not al dente), the langouste were rubbery and the sauce had little/no lobster taste.    Three ravioli for $36, $12 apiece for undercooked cheese ravioli and chewy rock lobster bits.  Had we not waited so long for the food to show up I would have sent it back.  The salmon was small but well cooked.  Flavor was pretty good, but the corn salad accompaniment was nothing special.  Cost $33.  The basket of breads was good, and the seasonal soup (chicken tortilla) was really well prepared - the only item we had that was worth the price ($12).  Two and a half star food at four-star prices.  Rated R (Ripoff).  So I would eat here for breakfast/lunch. If you insist on eating dinner here, order lunch - burgers / truffle potato chips / etc.  Avoid the pastas and be wary of the \"specials\".",

The only time we ordered more than 1 course at dinner, all the food came out at the same time.

Modern decor mixed with occasional pleasantries such as non abrasive check ins from time to time.  No complaints, rather just simple praise on a menu well done. There is a jalepeno cocktail on the menu that will rock your socks off, er, mouth off. Liiiii.....ttle caliente for my taste, but tasty nonetheless. Truth be told that my lips were on fire in the end even after eating my meal and bread to accompany. I did notice our waiter remembered us when we came back the next night for drinks which totally sealed the deal for another go in the future.",

Instead of running ozone generators to remove the smoke smell, they tried to cover it up with this overpowering odour.  I could feel my nose hairs burning in my nostrils. Chef must know because to compensate the food was overly spicy and loaded with basic flavours most likely to compensate for the horrible mgm odour. I'm glad he did, made eating there bareable. The place needs to be closed off from mgm. I recommend to avoid the mgm if you have asthma",

Good crust, waaay too soggy middles. Cmon wolf. This is supposed to be your specialty. French fries were excellent Wife ordered scottish salmon, plain and boring, but then again what salmon thats not wrapped in a handroll with a side on ponzu is? Not cheap, its moderately heavy. Wine list not impressive, and all bottle about 2.5x regular price. Stick with the diet cokes. Service was great, couldnt help laughing at all the cooks and waiters gawking at anything with a skirt pass by on new years eve. Poor souls! Oh yeah caesar salad was so-so. Thats all I can comment on, all our party ordered. Its ok but nothing super duper delish.",

From the moment we were seated we were surprised by the service and attention to detail. My water glass was never less than half empty during the entire course of our meal and we were asked numerous times if we needed anything else.   We ordered the 'Truffled Potato Chips, Maytag with Blue Cheese Sauce' and 'Wood Oven Pizza with Roasted Mushrooms, Broccolini, Leeks, Thyme and Taleggio.' The potato chips were something different than standard truffled potato chips. The blue cheese was bold enough to pair well with the truffle oil. All in all, making a complex tasting potato chip. Yummo! The pizza was great, although, I felt that the crust was tough and a little over cooked. The selection of toppings were unique for a vegetarian pizza and created a wonderful mesh of flavors.   I would definitely come here again for a causal dinner or late night bite when I'm back in Vegas.",

Tonight we visited Wolfgang Pucks Bar & Grill across from the KA theater. What a difference. Excellent food (Best damn chicken wings I've ever had!) and Chinoise salad delicious. Wife had linguini with clams. Pasta cooked perfectly. They even brought her the little clam fork. Service was outstanding from our waitress Natalie (who was training and was always attentive (friendly but not imposing, just right) and always checking with us) to the other team members who made sure water glasses were always full, bread was available, and dishes taken away promptly. Those guys at Mercato have very big shoes to fill in their former Puck space and have not hit the mark.",

Drinks had a little kick. Shrimp pizza, mushroom ravioli, shrimp fettuccine. All light in flavor but not the least bit disappointing. The shrimp in the fettuccine we too large to not deveined.

My first came out medium to medium well. Hate sending meat back. Then I guess to show me they sent out a charred burger. Why is it so hard to make a well done burger that's not burnt? Probably just better off not eating meat because I certainly don't trust the safety of our slaughter facilities to eat medium cooked hamburger. But that's another issue.",

The passion fruit mojito was really good (it was part of the reason I wanted to go back a second time ;) ).  The BBQ chicken pizza was really good, the sauce was sweet and tangy, the peppers had a little kick and the crust was perfect.

If you like blue cheese, I highly recommend trying these.  My husband had the grilled steak skewers as an entree, while I had the organic chicken. The steak was tender, flavored well, and the coleslaw was fresh and tasty. The organic chicken was beautiful, not just in presentation but also in terms of taste.

If it was busy I would understand but it was 3pm on a Sunday and not busy at all. There was a lot of people walking around not really doing anything. We waited about 10 minutes and were about to walk out when she finally came over to our table. After finishing our appetizers and waiting for our pizza she never came over to refill our drinks or check on us. She was however about 10 feet away from us chatting and laughing with the hostess. We had to ask a busboy to refill our drinks. And my boyfriend had to ask twice for his water refill. Service was overall disappointing but if you want a good meal you won't be disappointed with the food.",

The caesar salad and the gnocchi with ricotta did not disappoint. I always get a caesar here because they do the dressing right and it is tasty. Don't forget to try the house sangria as well! Come here before a show at MGM or after one, they're open pretty late and they do not disappoint.",

    "text": "On a Saturday night at 7pm, my husband and I were seated right away. We ordered the Butter Lettuce \"Caesar Salad\", MEATBALL WOOD OVEN PIZZA, and HOUSE MADE SPAGHETTINI PASTA. The salad was fresh. The Humboldt Fog Cheese was too strong for Bryan and I. But it was a good salad.  The homemade pasta dish had the simplest ingredients, which were tomatoes, basils, and garlic. It looked so simple that I didn't even take a picture. But the dish was amazing! The pasta was fresh and al dente. The sauce was packed with flavors. I couldn't stop eating. The meatball pizza was another surprise. The first bite was like a party in my mouth, which I didn't expect at all! There were layers of flavors, like the creamy Mozzarella, the sweet tomatoes, the fresh basil, and the tasty meatball. Everything went so well together. My husband loved the pizza absolutely.  Even though we were a bit full, I just couldn't pass the dessert. We got the RASPBERRY CHOCOLATE CHIP SOUFFLE. Wow..... It was light, a little tart, and very chocolatey. It was the best souffle ever! That was the perfect sweet ending.  Overall, my husband and I were very satisfied. For the two of us, our check was about $65. It wasn't expensive for a famous chef's restaurant! The food was simple. It wasn't some expensive ingredients, but everything was delicious. A simple meal can go a long way if food is cooked right. It was a very memorable meal. I couldn't wait to go back. Maybe we will try the one in Los Angeles!",

The portion was a good size for us to share. The crab cakes were good as well, but not the best I've had. I would still recommend them if you're a crab fan though!  I ordered the beef short rib ravioli and really enjoyed it! It was served with a delicious sauce and was topped with some delicious vegetables. I love my veggies! I had a delicious passion fruit iced tea and my glass was never empty. Our servers were very attentive.  My boyfriend ordered the Beef Short Rib entree and it was tender and flavorful. The portion was a very good size, so we were both quite full after our entrees. Despite this, we decided to give their desserts a try. We ordered the Pineapple Upside Down Cake, but it was way too sweet for my taste. The sorbet it was served with did help tone it down a bit, but it was still too sweet for me. This is a place I may have to visit again.",

You should definitely try one of the pizzas here and there is another one I want to try when I come back here next.  Our waiter was great! He had knowledge of the menu and was just overall great! Cups never empty and he checked regularly on us.  Portions were nice size didn't leave room for dessert this time around. Maybe next time I will!!

Both dishes were very delicious! The chicken in both dishes was cooked perfectly, it was moist and full of flavor. The crispy chicken was just as described, crispy and delicious. It was served with a grain mustard sauce which was a perfect complement to the chicken and salad it came with.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, but the service was slow. We gave ourselves plenty of time in order to make our show and we still cut it a little close. Our dishes were still delivered hot and we never had to ask for refills, so overall I can't complain too much. We still made our show in time and had a wonderful dinner.

We took ours to go, since we wanted to chill in our room and get comfy while eating. Ordered the roast beef sandwich, which apparently the couple next to us was eating (and when they heard what we ordered, they said it was a good choice). It's always nice to know if the food is good!  Portions are big! And I hope they were, because the prices were a little bit on the higher side! The roast beef sandwich tasted really good! Delicious meat, loved the horseradish spread, which wasn't too strong, and the  bread was just the right amount of crunchy. Chips were hand made, and were a little bit underseasoned, but easily fixed with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Definitely prefer underseasoned chips/fries to overseasoned, since that is a very easy fix.   Seriously, that sandwich was so good and filling, we had to take a nap right after eating.",

Too bad the people that wander by do not make for good people watching.   The food is delicious, but what made it better was the overall service. At points they were inattentive, but the complete experience was not bad. The fact that we shared everything and did not have to ask for anything to be split or an extra plate was amazing. They served our crab cakes, burger, and kabocha pumpkin agnolotti pasta as separate items for us. That simple gesture was impressive to me.   The crab cake came in an order of four. The light mixture of tomatoes and basil enhanced the sweetness of the crab well. The burger was salty. It is not a knock your socks off type of ordeal. The pasta was my favorite. The kabocha resembles a butternut squash and takes on the flavor of the brown butter sage sauce. The toast hazelnuts adds a much needed textural variation.   We ended our meal with the chocolate beignets. NOT A BEIGNET! It is more of a chocolate lava cake doughnut hole. They are good if you look at them like that, but as a beignet they failed.",

Wow, we ended up being impressed.  Nice menu, great choices, and prices reasonable.  To start, we ordered the Pink Lady Apple- Pear- shaved Fennel- Raisin-Shropshire cheese- sherry vinaigrette salad.   It was EXCEPTIONAL!  Fabulous....   it was such a generous size that even with sharing it, we each had a very large portion.  We loved it.  I hope I can duplicate it at home, it was soooooo good.  My son had a designer wood-fired oven pizza and declared it the best he ever had. (I think it was the Margherita, can't recall for sure).  Also the crab cakes.. yum.  Really good, not full of filler, just nice crab!  My spouse had handmade gnocchi, and I had spaghetti and meatballs.  Both excellent.... loved it.  The meatballs melted in my mouth, sauce was perfect.  Great service.  Nice casual atmosphere (not \"flip flop sloppy\" casual, but you dont need to go to too much trouble).  Convenient to MGM guests.  Wonderful place to eat!   And the price was not so bad compared to many of the other restaurants in the MGM and along the Strip.  Reasonable and very very good!",

Roasted peanuts and shredded chicken all chopped into fork size combinable bites.  It needed salt, but otherwise, quite good.  The caeser is legit.  It comes with anchovies thick , rich, creamy dressing, and parmesan.  The bread basket is very nice too, three choices, foccacia, french and a raisin served with softened whipped butter.  Thank you WP, I absolutely hat e it when my butter is cold and rips my bread.  Next we shared thje pork belly BLT and the sweet corn ravioli.  The BLT was good but didn't knock my socks off.  The portion was large; the sandwick was served with a big bowl of flavorful pasta slad.  The pork belly was delicious, of course.  I was dissapointed in the caliber of tomato on the sandwich.  It was a cheap snotty slice expected form a fast food burger.  The ravioli was pure bliss.  Sweet corn puree delicately placed in between fresh pasta, and topped with shaved truffles, shaved parmesan and bitty buttery mushrooms.  Whoa! So good.  MIL had a salmon burger on special and it quickly dissapeared, must have been good.  We finished with a latte and the choclate beigneits with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.  They were essentialy molten doughnut holes with an enjoyable bittersweet flavor.  My latte was perfection.    I was surprised when our bill was only $90.  Seemed reasonable to me for three people with three courses in the MGM for lunch.  I even had food to take home.  This is proabaly my 5th time dining here at WP and they really do a nice job.    Service was good, we ended up getting everything we needed.  A bit slow, especially for the level of business, but we weren't in a a hurry.",

    "text": "Many Vegas restaurants compete for glitz and glamour, so it's a real treat to be able to dine at a restaurant simply for it's homestyle comfort foods, and that's what Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill brings to the table time and time again!  Simple classics such as freshly made potato chips are dressed with truffle oil and a blue cheese dressing. Veal ravioli is gently tossed with mushrooms, brown butter and crisp sage.  A crispy chicken milanese is set apart with an arugula salad and cherry tomatoes.  And dessert is simply divine: a banoffee (banana and toffee) cream pie with a sugar dough shell, and bruleed bananas; a sorbet trio served in a brandy snap cup and topped with fresh berries.  Service needed slight improvement, granted the floor (both restaurant and casino) were busy, but the food should definitely be on everyone's checklist of things to see and do while on the Strip.",

Got there 15 minutes early and was seated immediately, even though the place was packed. Service was great, they must have been refilling our water every 5 minutes. We're big water drinkers, lol. Staff were friendly, and everything came out in a timely manner. Started with the Maytag truffled potato chips. Absolutely amazing! In my top ten of best things I've eaten. Main course I had the flat iron steak. Cooked correctly, but wasn't overly impressed with the flavor. Seemed like a standard steak you could get at any restaurant. The fries were regular old fries. The green beans were great though! For the price I thought the steak and fries should've been better. Still not bad though. My wife had the shrimp scampi fettuccini. Shrimp were huge and delicious! Noodles weren't so great. Fettuccini is my wife's go-to meal, and she didn't finish half of the noodles. Again, didn't taste bad, we just were hoping for more. Also had the Mac and cheese that was okay. So I probably wouldn't go there again, but I might see if they'll do the Maytag potato chips on a to go order. Also, I thought they might do something nice for our anniversary, since they had specifically asked what the occasion was when I made the reservation, but all we got was a Happy Anniversary from the waiter.",

But actually, I hadn't planned on coming to this restaurant; I had originally planned to go to another restaurant.    Well, after losing some money at gambling, I decided to go to here instead, since it was cheaper than the other.  Oh my goodness, it was THE BEST decision I have EVER made!!  We hadn't made reservations, and so, we got there at around 7:00PM on a Monday evening.  They told us that the wait is 10-15 mins, but we only waited for five.  My husband and I ordered: 1. Garlic-Chili Glazed Chicken Wings with Scallions, 2. Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese, & 3. Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Onions and Oregano.  It was ALL delicious!  We were stuffed that we couldn't order dessert, and I regret that now.  We were able to be a bit casual, which was a nice change.  The ambiance was really nice.  The hostess and servers were really polite, and our server checked up on us periodically.  And even more importantly, the prices were VERY reasonable for the quality of Wolfgang Puck's meal.  We paid about $70 for the two appetizers, one pizza, and two drinks (not including tip).  I highly recommend this place. :)",

We spotted Wolfgang Puck and knew he was a prestigious chef, but we were almost swayed away by the fancy looking decor, because we thought everything would be overpriced.  We checked out the menu outside and saw that everything was pretty reasonable ($15-$30 for most dishes). It was so hard to decide on what to order because everything sounded so good!  I had a bite of everyone's food and I loved every single dish on the table! I'd have to say my favorite of everything I tasted was the BLT, because the bacon wasn't your ordinary bacon; They were thick slices of pork belly \"glazed to perfection,\" as my friend kept saying!  I ordered the Ham and Turkey Club, which I know sounds boring haha, but it was so good! They PILED the meat and there was a third slice of bread in the middle, probably to keep all that ham and turkey from sliding around. The bread was crispy, and the portion was huge! They cut up my sandwich into four sections, and I only ate two and took the rest back to our hotel.  My friend's pizza was also delicious! I believe it was the Prosciutto and Goat Cheese Pizza: Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese.  I highly recommend going to Wolfgang Puck! The prices aren't outrageous, considering you are in Vegas, and the food is superb.",

But I did remember to order the Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce. :) It was good, but I wouldn't say delicious. The chips were freshly made, but a little to hard for my taste and the sauce was creamy but didn't have enough of a blue cheese kick. I also wish the sauce wasn't drizzled on but as a dip because if you didn't eat it fast enough it becomes sloggy chips.  Our friends had the cheese pizza which they said was delicious. We had also ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi, Sweet Fennel Sausage Bolognese. It was good especially the sausage bolognese, I just wished there was more of it on the plate. The gnocchi was good but after having a couple it became too heavy for me. Then we also had the Grilled Prime Burger, Vermont Cheddar, Smoked Onion Marmalade, which was a good hamburger, but nothing special. The decor of this place is pretty cool and you do feel like you are in the middle of the gambling action even though you are eating.  I would love to go back and try their desserts and some other dishes.",

I ordered the Prime Flat Iron steak with blue cheese butter, red wine sauce and fries $39.  I asked to substitute my fries for roasted cauliflower, they said \"no problem\".   I had a pre meal \"peach infused martini\" which was refreshing and tasty.  Flat iron can be a tough cut, the server assured us they are marinated for a long time and would be tender. He was right, my only comment would be that my piece hand some connective tissue that could not be cut with the knife, let alone chewed.  I had to surgically remove it in order to get the good part. My partner had the Ribeye ($48) and was all good! Two in our party were celebrating their anniversary, and the server brought out complementary cheese cake for them. Nice. The only other issue I had was that after the meal was complete, the server disappeared, and took awhile to bring checks. Over all, not a bad restaurant, but not really setting itself apart from the many options here.",

It is an open restaurant in the casino of the MGM. It wasn't loud when we went, due to the hour. There were only a couple other tables occupied & one server to the whole place. However, service was amazing! The waiter was friendly and courteous in demeanor, and very attentive. The busboy was also very attentive and kept our waters filled and other needs met.   My boyfriend ordered the chicken salad sandwich, which came with a lemon-y vinaigrette side salad. The sandwich was unique, but tasted good to him, and include grapes, and a hearty fruit & nut bread.  We started with the blue cheese truffle potato chips that everyone was raving about. I actually sent them back. I was so excited to try these as I love truffle & blue cheese! But to me, it didn't quite work. The chips were very oily. The sauce was warm & creamy, kind of like alfredo, & there were large chunks of blue cheese, which I actually felt was overwhelming! The warm sauce also made the chips in the middle a bit soggy. The waiter was incredibly gracious when he took away the dish & insisted that we not pay for anything we don't love.  For my meal, I got the wild mushroom pizza, which I ate for the next 2 days! It was very flavorful with the addition of leeks, broccolini, & some garlic. It was a bit oily, but after a couple blots it was good.The crust was also the perfect thickness.  Overall, a great option for late night quality dining with great service!",

    "text": "Went in last night for a solo dinner at the bar.  Bartender was prompt and courteous despite being fairly busy, as were his partners that would check in every now and again.  Multiple times they would come out with food that was \"extra\" and give them to folks at the bar to share.  Nice way to go about sampling and building camaraderie.  My dinner was really good.  Huge braised short rib, cooked perfectly with a nice creme fraiche horseradish sauce.  Underneath was a really good crispy spatzle that added nice texture to the food overall.  I also opted for the roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon confit.  A little too seasoned for my tastes but cooked well and still enjoyable.  The glass of Sangiovese was not great, the cocktails were very good.  Pricing was very reasonable for a casino and named restaurant.  All the food and drink mentioned was around $65 pre tip.  Rare to see a short rib dish around here for $30 norm seems to be around $40  Good meal and service, one note is that they are not owned by MGM so if You're an M Life member you won't get points, but the bartender told me that they will add them at the desk upon presentation of receipt.  We'll see but no biggie if not still worth a great meal!",

    "text": "We were staying at MGM and walked by Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill a few times. Finally, a couple hours before my bittersweet flight back to California, we figured why not. Plus we were short on time too.  Strange to say that the decor was actually quite elegant and simple, especially since it was right smack in the casino, but while in the Wolfgang Puck bubble, you'd nearly forget that there's a casino all around it.   Our server was very accommodating and funny, without being obtrusive.  The menu isn't overwhelming and a fwe items actually caught my attention. We ordered the corn chowder soup, burger with avocado and bacon with fries, organic chicken with veggies and yukon gold potatoes and the vanilla creme brulee.  The bread basket was a great way to start the meal, crusty, warm, doughy bread with a ton of soft slightly salted butter. They had an olive bread too whichw was just OK. The soup wasn't spectacular, it was more soup and less chowder in terms of consistency, but was flavored well either way.  Our entress looked yummy. I will admit though that the burger looked much more appetizing. Generous serving of fresh avocado and thick cut bacon atop that burger. Pretty sure he liked it. The chicken was seasoned nicely, tender and moist, although nothing to write home about.  I should have opted for either pizza or a burger as well.  I'm typically a huge fan of creme brulee, but this particular dish was missing the vanilla part of its name, and was very eggy less custardy, if that makes sense. Actually didn't finish it if you can believe that.   Overall, I would have probably fancied my meal better had I ordered something else, but that's what second reviews are for.",

It was around 8:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night and our wait for a table was about 5 mins.   I ordered the Calamari & Mushroom and Truffle Pizza as our appetizers. Both were really good. The Mushroom with truffle pizza was the best pizza I've ever had. I also had a couple of Pineapple Mojito's and it was excellent.   My entree was Wolfgang's Chinois Salad. Absolutely yummy however for $16, I expected it to be off the hook. Given the upscale feel of the restaurant and its ambiance, I guess paying $16 is a little justified.  This restaurant is a must try if you're ever visiting or staying in the MGM Grand Hotel.",

A few of us were cashing in their myVEGAS rewards and it went through without any hassle. The staff and their friendly attitude already set us in a good mood.  Without further ado, the food was A+. For the appetizers, I was able to try a bit of the tuna tartare and that was delicious. The flavors blended together so nicely that I wished I had my own order.   As for the entrees, I had the grilled salmon and frankly, it was one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had. It was seared beautifully; the outside was crisp while the inside was slightly undercooked. I also got to try my friend's Ribeye (great) and the Linguini with grilled shrimp (as a pasta lover, this was very good). Moreover, I tried Brussel sprouts for the first time here and I couldn't stop eating it!  Overall, I felt that this restaurant was worth the hype. Everything, from the food to the service, was on point. I would definitely dine here again if I'm back in Sin City.",

It is flavorful, fresh, and definitely hits a \"comfort food\" sweet spot. Their spaghetti and meatballs are also good, so I would recommend them.  I was not personally a fan of the pizza, I'll likely give it another chance some other time. But have avoided it since the first time.  Drink selection is very good, and they have a good Anderson Valley Gose sour that I like. More expensive than back home (Portland, OR) - but I haven't found anywhere else to get it when in Vegas, so it is what it is.  Staff has always been fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. Seating time is hit or miss depending on how busy it is, of course, but the open seating at the bar can alleviate that depending on group-size.  My only qualm, and I obviously did not take off any stars for this, is that it is a very open establishment in the midst of the MGM casino floor, so it is very smokey. If that isn't your thing when dining, you may want to look elsewhere to eat. Otherwise, check it out!",

Service both times was awesome (Jeremy- you rock and we can't wait to get divorced and re-married at your drive through chapel!). Easy to substitute sides with the sandwiches if you desire.  We had onion rings instead of a salad (cause we are on a health food kick) with the club sandwich.  Onion rings were crispy and not oily.  Sandwich had a nice aoli.  BBQ pizza freaking rocked (another choice made with our healthy diets in mind).  Fries were skinny and crispy which is my favorite!  The lamb wrap was a little heavy and I would skip next time around.  Might have been nice with a tzatziki sauce.  Also, price of soda was a little steep-4.50. I was glad I opted for an alcoholic beverage instead as it was probably a better value.  For lunch, this is a great option.  We will return.",

The cheese sauce comes out warm, but we had to wait a while for our food and I didn't want to fill up on chips so they got cold and kinda gross. So make sure you eat those chips while they're warm! I also had the short ribs pappardelle, also amazing. The pasta was al dente, the short ribs were moist and flavorful, and the sauce was perfectly creamy with the added ricotta.

Staff was friendly enough, I sat at the bar and the female bartender really took care of me. She was helpful and checked on me just enough as I enjoy a football game on the screen above the bar.  Food was just okay, nothing special. I started with a seasonal soup, it happened to be butternut squash, flavorful but not overly feeling. Followed it up with the tempura battered fish and chips. Fish was a little too greasy for my taste and fries were lukewarm and nothing special.  Best part of the meal was the pineapple mojito, well crafted, great hint of alcohol and nice flavor with the pineapple. Well made drink.  All in all, you can go to say you went but I wouldn't rush to make it on the hit list unless you can get a comp from the hotel.",

    "text": "NOT YOUR TYPICAL WP RESTAURANT - THIS ONE SUCKS! I can't believe that the Los Angeles Airport WP Express has better food quality than this traditional restaurant.  The overall food presentation was pathetic, the tastes were odd, and this was certainly not worth the trek or new $7 parking at the MGM.  As a fan of Wolfgang, I was excited to try this restaurant.  HOWEVER, the food items that we ordered were sub-par and a massive disappointment.  Here's the cliff-note version: 1.  truffled potato chips, Maytag bleu cheese sauce - maybe crispy fries would be better than soggy chips; cheese sauce ROCKED but how can you go wrong with cheese? 2.  grilled Jidori chicken skewers - too many different flavors that was distracting:  yuzu and aioli mixture was confusing and stymied the succulent chicken.  BUMMER! 3.  Italian sausage, creme fraiche, etal. - salty and lacked flavor other than too much salt 4.  house made ricotta gnocchi, etal. - swimming in tomato sauce, mushy gnocchi, no \"wow;\" another pass! 5.  wild mushroom ravioli - OVERWHELMINGLY SALTY; we sent this back because there was no hope.    When our party of 4 left after our brief visit, and the general comment was \"eh,\" then it is safe to say that the entire experience was terrible.  The saving grace was the service; our server Zak and busser (didn't catch his name) were both on-the-ball!  They were both attentive and professional while Zak was apologetic for our crappy food.  In fact, I felt bad in that he didn't make the food, he simply took our order and had it delivered.  Although the service was good, I wouldn't return.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PARTICULAR WP RESTAURANT!!!",

The tuna tartar appetizer is really fresh and delicious. I also got the Italian sausage pizza, which is a bit salty and heavy but still good. Couldn't eat more than 2 slices. The fettuccine pasta, surprisingly, isn't a cream sauce, but it's still yummy and the pasta is extremely chewy. It wasn't heavy at all and it had a nice veggie ratio.The burger. So delicious and the cole slaw was extremely generous. The fries weren't amazing but they did the job of making me pick at them over and over. The chicken entree wasn't too great either-I've had better mashed potatoes, but the chicken was so soft and tender that it tasted almost like salmon and it was cooked masterfully.  Best of all? The service. We had to change some things around on our bill since we were separating between rooms but the server was extremely nice about it, even when he had to get the manager involved. The waiters made sure my water was always filled to the brim and they got us new bread quickly every time we asked for it.  Will be back, as always.",

We were seated by the hostess, and shortly greeted by our server.  He was super nice and helpful as well.  He genuinely seemed to enjoy his job.    After much time pondering the menu, the GF decided on the breakfast tartine, and I ordered the mushroom pizza.  We also ordered a side of the market corn.  The breakfast tartine was interestingly presented.  Imagine a scrambled egg omelette served on top of a thick slice of bread.  It was good, and the crispy potatoes served with it were excellent.  The pizza was fantastic.  I have never had taleggio cheese, and it tasted great with the mushrooms and truffle.  The corn was a great side.  It was like fresh corn mixed together with vegetables to form a salsa like dish.  Don't tell anyone, but I even put some on top of the pizza and it made the two dishes even better!    Great service and good food.  What more can you ask for?",

A business gathering in Vegas led us to finding a restaurant that was pretty well known and \"all around\" for everyone, there's one of these in many major cites across the states, so we planted ourselves down at the bar, wrapping the corner on a weekend afternoon.  I was craving breakfast at 2 in the afternoon and even though they weren't serving it, they had a buttermilk biscuit egg sandwich with sausage and cheddar on the menu that was calling my name, one of the best I've had hands down.   The bartender was on point, he kept the wine coming and the water flowing as I was dehydrated and probably needed about six glasses by the end of lunch. This Wolfgang Puck is at the MGM, in the middle of a lot of action, he had some suggestions for us after we wrapped up our late lunch and went on our way.  -Eric Statzer",

And it didn't help that there was an obnoxious group of people so loud and out of control that the floor manager had to talk to them and apologize for them to us which was appreciated.

    "text": "I never thought I would write a five star review for a Vegas restaurant. In all my visits to Vegas, I have always felt somewhat disappointed by the food offered. Maybe my expectations are too high because the prices are so damn high...  Either way, I am proud to say that my recent meal at Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill was an all-around, excellent experience. Yes, the prices were up there, but the food and service actually made it worth it.  I have to agree with Denice Z. that this is an amazing people-watching spot. There's really no need to even have a conversation with your dinner date with all the hilarious people walking around. Why talk when you can stare? Unfortunately, you will eventually be encouraged to look away when your food arrives. My husband and I started off with some drinks (the pineapple ginger mojito was delicious) and the caprese salad. The caprese could have used more mozzarella, but the tomatoes were so flavorful and divine that I barely noticed. I love that they tossed some onions and greens into the dish. So good! They also bring a basket of focaccia/Italian bread to the table which is soft and fresh. For our main dishes, we went with the three cheese ravioli and spaghettini. Both were delicious and very filling. I could barely make a dent in my spaghettini after the bread and caprese, but I did my best. I love the chunks of tomatoes and sliced basil that they mixed into the sauce. Seriously tasty!  I will tell you that all that food totaled over $80 and that didn't include tip. So it was definitely not cheap. But if you're looking for a nice meal out in Vegas that's not overly stuffy or formal, I would definitely recommend it. It's right in the heart of the MGM and I guarantee there will be plenty to see and eat! Enjoy yourselves!",

Drake deemed his dish the epitome of the phrase.. \"winner winner chicken dinner\" hahaha however, my dish was just alright.. I think there was wayyyyyyy too much cheese and not enough eggplant.. =(   i really wanted to love this place because drake and steph thought it was soo good.. i really liked brian's crispy chicken tho.. but i did love love LOVE the pomegranate mojito  i gave it 4 stars because my friends loved it so much and it was great seeing them happy haha im corny. yea so?",

I've eaten here years ago and found the food good, but not amazing.  However, on this night everything was spectacular.    My osso bucco was so succulent I even dug the marrow out of the bone (nasty, huh?) and sopped up every bit of goodness with the creamy Parmesan risotto.  I couldn't help it though. Chef Lewandowski reduced me to a caveman discovering the primal joy of meat meeting fire.    Even my friend's pan roasted chicken was incredible.  When was the last time you had roasted chicken that made you pause after the first bite to marvel at its juicy goodness?  I can't wait to go back.",

It looked alot better than the buffets we've been to. With no reservations, the hostess sat us down promptly with the waiter coming by a few minutes later to take our drink order. He suggested we try a few items, of which we ordered all. Never heard of a hanger steak and doesn't sound too appetizing, we ordered it hoping for the worse... well, I have to say that was the most amazing piece of beef I have put into my mouth. So juicy and tender... aaahhhh... As pricey as it was for a slice of meat, I would run back here to have one. If we ever go back to Vegas, I would need to make a stop here for a piece of steak.  Now I understand the hype behind chefs... I bow down Wolfgang Puck... Amazing.",

So after asking around and consulting Yelp, we found this place right in the middle of the MGM Casino. BOY were we lucky! Service was as to be expected from a classy but casual restaurant. Waiter was attentive and knew his menu. The choices were mouthwatering. We had the italian pizza and my partner had the Burger with Vermont Cheese. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G on all levels. Wonderful! Would highly recommend!",

Everything was delicious!  The butter that came out with the rolls was whipped and creamy and before you know it, we were gobbling up the bread and butter that came to the table.  WHAT A MISTAKE!  Of course we ate too much so that by the time our entrees came out (flat iron steak with fries, rib eye with carmelized cauliflower), we were so full!  Still, that didn't stop us from thoroughly enjoying every last morsel.  Oh, the food was so good....  Our waitress was friendly and quick and my only regret was that I didn't order more mojitos.",

But, it's True! read on....  Wolfgang Puck had the honor of being my last meal in 2007 and what started out as a seemingly average dinner of Organic Chicken with Garlic Potato Puree and Rosemary Jus, I mean seriously I have that like every night.  My meal was accompanied by a vodka tonic and a nice sauvignon blanc, but it just wasn't enough to make me feel like my last '07 wasn't somewhat disappointing.    Until....dessert.  Imagine how bored I must have felt to pass up chocolate brownies, crme brule and other delectables to settle on bread pudding.  I even gripped about how long it was taking to come out saying that it was just bread pudding and it shouldn't take long.  So imagine my surprise and delight with the king-size portion arrived topped with vanilla ice cream and surrounded by custard and accompanied by an Irish Coffee...mmmmm. At first bite, I knew...this is living!",

I had a lemon drop to drink. Weak. For 13 bucks, it was not worth it. Didn't do much for me and the sad part is that I'm a total weak sauce.   Then we started off with the crab cakes. They serve 4 mini crab cakes about the size of fifty cent coin. It was pretty good. It was topped with a tomato relish, that lighten up the crab cakes. They were pan fried so they were as heavy to begin w/ anyways. They were small, but that was expected.   I had the tomato, basil, and mozzarella pizza. Also known as the margherita, which would have been a much simpler name when it came to ordering purposes, but i guess the former is much fancier? Who knows. But the pizza was good. But usually always is. Simple ingredients. Can't really mess it up. The bf had the fish of the day which happened to be halibut. It had to be the smallest portion ever! With no sides. It had a sweet corn puree under it and nothing else! For 30 bucks!? Soo not worth it.   I don't think you get much of an experience from Wolfgang so I can't say even if the food is cruddy that you'd have fun. But if you really must try it then I guess there's no stopping you.",

Happily this Wolfgang Puck outlet fits that small niche with reasonable and very good food.  I had the 3-course prix fixe menu: heirloom salad/cheese salad, scallops (3) with reduction, and bing cherry cheesecake with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream for $40. An excellent deal esp since a similar scallop dish on the main menu was like $35. My dining companions had the ricotta gnocchi ($22) and chicken artichoke stuffed pasta ($21). They said that both their dishes were good. Additionally, I had ice tea ($3.50) and other person had two glasses of sparkling wine ($9 each). Total before tip was $112.62. Cheaper for Vegas.  Our waitress was very good. The only goof was that the server of the food didn't get recipient of each dish right. Also the cheesecake came a bit quickly too. Always made sure the glasses were full of water and ice tea.  Verdict: Not all Puck restaurants score, but this one is a goal.",

After a very positive experience there I knew it would be a definite hit on our first night in Vegas when both my husband and I were too beat to stray very far for dinner.  With so many expensive and upscale options in all of the casinos on the strip, it's nice to find a place that has all the taste and style without the insane cost.  Started out with the truffled potato chip appetizer--  Highly recommend I had the gnocci and my husband had the spaghetti & meatballs, both delicious, and topped off dinner with a slice of the lemon cheesecake, which was big enough to split  (I do hate when places get skimpy with dessert portion size).  We would definitely return, in Vegas or in AC!",

At the bistro I had the lobster and bacon club sandwich which was also great served with garlic shoestring fries.  and for desert get the raspberry ice cream with chocolate cake can't remember the exact name for it right about now !  as for appetizers, make sure you try the pizza and popcorn shrimp because those deserve 4 1/2 stars !",

You couldn't ask for a better crew. They all are really the very best. Being on first name basis with all of them makes your dining experience more personal with the feeling that they will see to it that you will have all that you desire for your meal. I believe Jason is the top in management with JP and Jaimie seeing to it that the rest of the staff take care of your every need. Josh is exceptional as your bartender, being very attentive to your needs. Edwin, your chef see's to it that every dish is as special as the last. Christian, being your polisher makes sure that everything is polished above standard and very presentable.  Each of them always presents you with a smile and warm greeting.  And then there is the food, oh the yummy food. They offer many wonderful dishes, never to disappoint. I can't say enough great things about the food. You just have to go and experience it all as we have and I am sure that Wolfgang Puck will also become your favorite place to go to also. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Chinois Chicken Salad: O how I love thee. In the midst of a heavenly mustard vinaigrette rests a mound of hand-picked vegetation, poultry, and cashews. What a dramatic presentation and reasonable cost for a dish that will absolutely blow your mind.  The fusion of two worlds into one salad dish shouldn't be overlooked. Roasted sesame seeds, peanut oil, soy sauce, sesame oil, Napa cabbage, carrot thins, snow peas...the list goes on. Asiatic Americana, perhaps? Crisp and fresh, the cabbage was the captain of this dish and the chicken slices played the role of commander in chief--fortifying the plate with a cosmopolitan tenderness.  If this fresh and crisp salad isn't enough to satisfy your palate, try the Rigatoni with fennel sausage in a light bolognese base. Wolfgang reaches a happy medium between sweet and savory--think of the midpoint between traditional marinara and vodka sauce. The pasta tubules are firm, but not too firm. Perhaps a tad over-salted, but this is compensated for with an appropriate spice-heat level, accentuated by the sausage (blended inconspicuously into the sauce base.)  The service was of a high caliber and the atmosphere didn't disappoint. My expectations were exceeded, especially for Vegas, as servers were extra-courteous, smiling--indicating a happy-to-help attitude, and appropriately checking in on the quality of the meal.  This particular review would warrant 5 stars, however I determined that a reasonable deduction should be made for the length of time in meal preparation: the time between order and arrival exceeded 50 minutes. I'm no fan of rushed foods, but the dishes ordered could have been prepared more expeditiously.  I highly recommend Wolfgang at MGM Grand. Make a reservation and enjoy your meal!",

After spending too much time gambling, I ended up panicking trying to find a nice place to eat  at 2 in the morning. So i picked WPE which was conveniently close and open! We ordered:  Truffle chips- dont' get it. didnt' find anything special about it. and i hate blue cheese. all hype my friends  crabcakes- so juicy and moist. get it.  vongole- very large in portion. and soo delicious. best dish of the night  mesquite skewers- pretty good.   shrimp tomato pasta ( i forget the name)- They were out of the original pasta so used angel hair instead. big mistake. Worst dish of the night. We barely touched it. It was so bland, i just ate the shrimp.DON'T GET IT  We ended up not finishing a lot of the food because we weren't aware that the portions were relatively large and forgot 2 isn't our usual dinner time.",

Mac n' Cheese was quite delicious, cheesy, some gooey, crisp bits at the top.   I had the chicken milanese, which was ridiculously large. I couldn't finish it. Still, it was quite refreshing after all the bread and pasta I was eating. Oh, wait. Mac n' cheese counts as pasta. See? I need to have it in every meal.   Sangria. Cool, refreshing. Light. With a little zing. Seltzer? Sparkles? I'd get another. More, please.   All in all, wait wasn't too long. And they take reservations. If you, in theory, don't want to wait.   Our waiter was okay. Pretty attentive. But...occasionally I had to chase him down. It's all good though.",

    "text": "Great little place right in the heart of the MGM casino! We decided to eat dinner here before playing a little and the location is super convenient. The service was very friendly- there was a short wait but the very friendly hostess provided the option of texting your cellphone when a table is ready which lets you wander around the casino floor while you wait.   Food was really good. There isn't a huge selection but what they do have they do well. They brought a basket of warm bread to start which was delicious. We started off with the Calamari which was tasty and cooked just right. We then shared a the prosciutto topped pizza which was amazingly delicious and more than enough for the both of us to share.  My only word of caution is that you best avoid this place if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke. This restaurant is literally in the middle of the casino with no walls separating it from the action and so you do have players lighting up all around. But then again if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke then you shouldn't be anywhere near a Vegas casino in the first place.   I'd have to respectfully disagree with those the have criticized the pricing- for Wolfgang Puck in a Vegas Casino this was very reasonable priced. The pizza was the most expensive one on the menu priced at around $18 and the Calamari around $14- that's a bargain for a nice restaurant located in a Vegas Casino. But perhaps its because I'm from New York and used to being overcharged for everything.",

Very good homemade chicken noodle soup. Ate here for a few days and it was consistently on point. Solid service. Open 24 hrs too! Side note, those potato chips everyone writes about are not that great, though unique, they are very heavy handed, blue-cheese completely overpowers truffle flavor, they are just sauced chips in the end. French-fries are also not spectacular, but side salads are perfect.",

Enjoyed a \"late night\" meal with friends - truffled potato chips and Wood Oven Roasted Mushrooms, Broccolini, Leeks, Thyme, Taleggio Pizza.  OMG, the pizza was amazing; we ate at the bar and the service was perfect.  Generally, if I'm out of town it's more fun to eat at more than one place but the food was so good I went back with my friend for lunch the day we left.  We had the Fuji Apple Salad with Fennel, Golden Raisins, Dates, Shropshire Cheese, Spiced Almonds - everything was shredded and it was delicious.  We chose the Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese pizza, and it was great. The bartender made my friend a \"Pear-tini\" that was off the hook.    Thank you for 2 fabulous meals!",

I originally suggested we try Pub 1842, but we decided to eat here upon suggestion of the friend she came with.  The menu choices are okay, but not great in my opinion. There is mostly pizza and pasta with a couple other choice such as a burger or a steak. I try to stay away from foods containing gluten, so there weren't much options for me to chose from as I didn't want to pay that much for a steak. I ended up getting the Heirloom Tomato Caprese from the appetizer menu for $17. It was good, but I don't think it was really worth $17 and I was hungry a few hours later. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I think I would rather go somewhere else. My mom and her friend got the burger and she said it was pretty good.",

We were seated within 5 minutes, and had two very attentive servers.  I had the grilled steak skewers: perfectly cooked, in a sweet and spicy sauce. My friend had ricotta gnocchi in ragu. Both were fairly yummy.  The best part of meal was the coffee and the chocolate beignets we had for dessert.

TIP: SHARE!!!!!! i really wish we had looked at other people's dishes so we would've realized that each dish was a hefty portion. i think we assumed it'd be like those other expensive places that charge you $$ for a tiny portion, but this place gives you a good amount. i'd highly recommend sharing...!!

We put our name on the list with the hostess for what she said was a 20 minute wait.  After about 20 minutes, she called our name and we walked up to the hostess stand to be led to our table.  At that point some guy came up and said something to her.   All of a sudden she led him and his party off to be seated.  A minute later, she returned to tell us that \"it would be a few more minutes while they prepared our table.\"  A few minutes turned into 10 minutes.   From time to time, she offered various excuses, but there we stood at the hostess stand, awkwardly waiting for \"our table\".  Eventually a different hostess came up to us and asked if we minded sitting out in an area that was inundated with cigarette smoke.   We were so tired and hungry at that point that we said OK and had a meal of overcooked gnocchi and cigarette smoke.   It was clear in retrospect that our hostess had decided to give away our table to someone she knew and then had lied about it.   Not good.",

Oh well, one downside: I don't know what I bit into, but it was as hard as a rock. I was worried I chipped a tooth, but everything with my tooth is okay. I like the setup, it's kind of trendy, but casual. You can watch your chefs prepare your pizza right in front of you.",

At no time at all did the waiter come over and apologize for the dealt! Therefore, we got up and were ready to leave and here come the waiter with our food! We decide to stay what the heck we waited this long! My husband ordered the mushroom pizza and it was delicious! I ordered the Prime burger and there was nothing Prime about it! The bun was burnt and the burger was dry as heck! The manager came over and offered us dessert and we declined and he comped by not so Prime burger, which was nice! Long story short your safe with the pizza but don't order the not so Prime Burger!",

It was my boyfriend's birthday and we didn't even tell the server, but from our conversation he was able to tell who birthday it was and sent out a birthday treat.  So sweet of him.  Everything we ordered was so great.  I would definitely come back.  My girlfriend and I came in on Sunday morning to Tuesday and we ate here.  My boyfriend was here since Friday and went here twice, since it was so good.    One dislike is on Sunday night, you can't really make reservation which was very frustrating.  It didn't take us that long to find a table, but what if we had to wait a long time, I would had been unhappy. lol",

On our first day we scoped out the hotel and noticed this quaint, but stylish restaurant nestled in right by the Ka Theatre! We knew we had to try it. The next day we called ahead of time to reserve, and they said they shouldn't be too busy as it was a Tuesday night. That night of Ka, we just showed up and were seated immediately. We were promptly greeted by our friendly waiter. Based on a previous review I read, I was very intrigued to try the \"Truffled Potato Chips.\" Oh boy was that review right! Our family devoured that plate in a matter of minutes! The cheese sauce was, hands down, the best cheese sauce I have ever had. (And for those of you who don't like blue cheese, don't worry, you could hardly taste it!) I ordered a plain burger with a few toppings. It was very tender (not my favorite, but still a marvelous burger). For dessert we ordered a Creme Brulee. It came on a huge plate with lots of fruit. It was very delicious. When we received our bill we were shocked to find how affordable it was. We were expecting twice what we were charged! In the end, this restaurant is affordable, delicious, stylish, and very close to the Ka theatre, and we can't wait to come back here.",

Pretty certain I will be returning as soon as I can :-) My boyfriend and I decided to have our anniversary dinner here. Making a reservation with them was a breeze. I was asked if there was something we were celebrating and if there were any dietary restrictions. When we arrived, the restaurant was very busy, but we were seated quickly. I was overly excited about how they personalized our menus to say \"Happy Anniversary!\" with the date on them. We ordered the truffle potato chips to start and a pasta and pizza dish to share. The linguine in white wine sauce and clams was light yet flavorful. I'd love to learn the recipe for this sauce! And the mushroom pizza was hands down the best mushroom pizza I have ever had. Wish I wasn't so full- I would've killed it! Our server (sadly forgot his name) was amazing and very attentive through our whole visit, and even brought us a creme brulee for dessert, which I loved! Everything was great, and if I am ever in the MGM again, I will for sure be eating that pizza.",

Our water glasses were never empty, which was very good since we all needed to hydrate.   Food - Absolutely amazing! We ordered the park chop that was the best pork chop I have ever tried in my life! Juicy, full of flavor and cooked to perfection! The chicken was also extremely flavorful and juicy. The cauliflower was amazing too! I could eat it all day! I ordered the prosciutto pizza. The pizza was a perfectly cooked crust, full of very good prosciutto, a light red sauce, mozzarella cheese, goat cheese and fresh arugula. Also the bread they served was fresh out of the oven and was a mix of a sourdough and another one that had caramelized onions. Sooooo good!  I was very glad that I had such a great dining experience with my friends to enjoy with me. This is now one of my new must eat at stops in Vegas. It was that good!",

I was excited to eat here since I've dined here a couple years ago before and had a good experience.  My family was really happy with where they sat us and how welcoming they were! Everyone had smiles on their faces and was so friendly.  Pork chop entree: My sister got the pork chop entree and it was served so beautifully! The meat was good, a bit too dry for my tasting but regardless it was still really good. Especially with the sauce they had on the side!  Flat iron steak: I had a rare flat iron steak and it was cooked perfectly rare, the way I liked it! They had just enough seasoning on it and the dipping sauce that was served with it complimented the steak very well.  Fried calamari: One of the best that I've tasted! Dipping sauce made it even better! It's lightly battered and not too crunchy. Yummy!  Braised short ribs: My dad had the braised short ribs which was super tender! Definitely would recommend this dish to friends.  Mediterranean Sea bass: it was the special for the day! My mom isn't much of a meat eater so she opted for fish. The fish was really good and I am a fan! Especially for those who aren't feeling like steak or pork, sea bass is the way to go!   Salmon entree: My brother had the salmon entree which was good, but nothing too impressive. It's pretty basic compared to everything else they have to offer on the menu.  The complimentary bread is yummy too! Especially the ones with toppings on it haha good balance of sweet and salty on the bread.",

    "text": "Wolfgang Puck doesn't disappoint! And you can have access to his deliciousness up until 6 AM. Open all night long!  It's past midnight and there's still a 30-minute wait, so we walk around to kill time. By the time we're seated, we're excited to see whether the hype is True. And it's definitely worth it for good food at this hour. So...what to order?  FOOD: --------- We started with the **Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers**, which was much larger than one would expect for an appetizer. 5 divine skewers! The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth, and the savory flavors burst forth. What a pleasant surprise!   I'm a total carnivore, but the **Vegetable Pizza** really hit the spot. You can't go wrong with oven roasted tomatoes, basil pesto, mozzarella, and Nicoise olives. Sometimes pesto is a nice change.  And finally, there's no way we could resist the **Three Cheese \"Mac 'n Cheese\" **. I thought the price was a little high at $12, but when that sucker showed itself I understood everything. Even the meaning of life. We were again pleasantly surprised by a fairly-sized portion that helped induce food comas all around.  Although prices are higher than the super casual cafe around the corner, the quality of food at this hour is really quite impressive.  SERVICE/AMBIANCE: --------------------------- Crowd is mixed; you'll see people of all ages here. Most are stopping by after a long night in either casual or fancy attire, depending where they came from or where they're headed. So you'll see business suits, skimpy club attire, grungy gym clothes, and even hipsters. You should never be surprised in Vegas.  My only issue is with the service. The hosts were polite, but our server took forever to take our order. We must have waited 15-20 minutes in our seats before ordering, and this is after we had already waited 30 minutes outside. He provided great recommendations and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but he NEVER came back to check on us. When we wanted to pay our bill he was socializing with one of the other servers, so I had to go ask him for it. I'm sure the other staff there are not as negligent as he is. At least I hope not!  TIP: Overall this place is great for late night and I definitely recommend it when you're staying at the MGM Grand.  DATE TIP: Ohhh yeah, open til 6 AM. Perfect for your Vegas late night date night schedule!",

    "text": "This place is the perfect example of overpriced food.   You would think that a restaurant named after a recognized chef would be somewhat satisfying right? Well wrong, not here. My experience at Wolfgang puck was one where I wished I went to shake shack down the street instead of wasting my time and money here.  For all the entrees on the menu, they are priced from 25-40, so you expect something you would get out of a 4 star restaurant. Unfortunately what you get here is flavorless food that is dry and underwhelming in all aspects. I feel like whoever is cooking the food just puts it on the grill and wishes for the best. There is no seasoning on the food at all. The food that I was putting my mouth was like a large solid of nothing; my water had more flavor than the food and my water only had one lemon in it.   I am in no attempt trying to bash this place at all but if you are presented as a \"fine dining\" restaurant then serve food like one.",

I was tempted to order the Thanksgiving dinner, but it was too much food for me.  We tried the Maryland Blue Crab Cakes, Pumpkin Tortellini, and Sauteed Scottish Salmon. The crab cakes were nicely browned on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. The dish was served with a tasty Basil Pesto Aioli. I loved the flavors of the Pumpkin Tortellini, which was made with brown butter and sage--everything blended so well together. The tortellini was fresh, although the folds of dough were a bit too thick for me. The salmon was nicely cooked, and the mushroom ragout and pork belly were nice additions to the dish. Our friend had the Roasted Turkey Sandwich (the cheapest, but the most filling) which he said was really good.  Service was good. It wasn't crowded when we went, so the food came out quickly. The waiter was friendly and checked on us pretty often.  This is a convenient spot to grab some gourmet food on a budget.",

    "text": "Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but this place didn't live up to its great reviews and four star ratings. I went with a large group for a friend's birthday dinner. We were seated in the back near the bathroom and man the table was so uncomfortable. The table had high bar stools that were so close to the actual table, nobody had enough leg room. It was off to a bad start...   Be careful when they ask you what water you want. They offer $9 bottles of water and they don't specify the price when they ask you if you want water. The table started off with calamari for appetizers and this was good. The only good part of the meal. The avocado green sauce was delicious and the roasted peppers that came with the calamari was a nice touch.  For my main dish, I went with the manila clam linguine. My boyfriend went with the burger. A few others opted for pizza, the pork chop, and a few of the pasta dishes. The pizza seems to be the best main dish out of the bunch. It's a decent size and the thin crust was good. I heard the pork chop was on the drier side. The pasta dishes were such small portions. The burger was pretty average. The fries that came along with the burger were actually good. For myself, I was pretty disappointed. I understand linguine usually is a simple sauce but this had no flavor at all. Thankfully I enjoyed my clams and had a decent portion of that.  I didn't get the good vibes and delicious food that other Yelpers were noting. Again, maybe I ordered the wrong thing? But this place, for lack of a better word, sucked.",

Not what I expected, sorta just out in the open, all Vegas casino raw. No privacy or distinction really.

    "text": "We were a little disappointed when we had made a reservation weeks in advance for 5 pm dinner on December 16th only to show up to a ghost town the night of. We found a lovely woman (wish we asked for her name) in the restaurant who had indicated that they were closed for the night to replace the flooring, but would resume regular dinner service the following day.  She said she would make our reservation for tomorrow evening and make sure we \"will be taken care of\".    We arrived the next evening and it made up for the mix-up before.  There is a certain standard at Wolfgang and that was apparent during our service. Our server was very courteous and attentive. , there are servers going around tables specially to refill waters and drinks. The complimentary bread basket contained roasted garlic focaccia and whole grain bread.   We started with Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers ($17), Creamy Slaw, House Steak Sauce, cooked medium. The sauce was a combination of tangy (think A1), and sweet BBQ. The steak were cooked into perfect bite size morsels and just melted in the mouth.  We ordered the Jidori Half Chicken, Braised Kale, Yukon Potato Puree, Rosemary Jus ($28) and \"Spaghetti & Meatballs\", Spicy Tomatoes, Garlic, Sweet Basil, Pecorino Romano ($24). I was expecting the chicken entree to be a broasted chicken, instead it was a pan fried chicken at of the potatoes that were so fluffy, you'd think they were whipped. The meatballs were the best meatballs I've ever had! It was a blend of beef and pork, with a little bit of panko bread crumbs. The portions are so satisfying, we needed a to go box after eating what we thought was a huge portion of our meal.  For our troubles, we were comped the appetizers. Our total if we had paid full price would have been $74 before tip.  We came here last year as well and the consistency in the food and service has not changed. We are likely to make this an annual stop, it's so good!",

We order (party of 2) pizza, grilled chicken with veggies, and a large salad. enough to feed four!  Okay, He serves our water.. and leaves. (where is he for the soda, wine, or tea?)  Comes with our food and asks if everything is fine.. \"yes\" and leaves.   Now the older couple next to us is served. HE went to them about 4 times to make sure if everything was fine, if they needed more water, more cheese on the salad, and desserts..  He came to us ZIP- ZERO- times. maybe it was our age, maybe we did not look like the good tipping type. so he catered to the older couple.  the bus boy came and served me more water. Guess who got extra tip?   I was fuming. since i still wanted dessert, but was never asked.. he just brought us the bill.. And HE still got his good tip...  was it deserved?

For dinner, I went with meatloaf and the hubby ordered the prosciutto pizza.  I wouldn't normally order meatloaf for dinner, but it sounded like a good option to go with the wine.  The food was pretty good.    This would probably be my second favorite place of the MGM restaurants.  It is a good option for decent food at decent prices.",

The pizza is good but pizza is pizza, and it's not something I really crave at a fancy restaurant.  Now, as for the dessert, that was really impressive! I had a chocolate souffle with vanilla bean ice cream- on the house for my birthday! Service is really fantastic here. I have also tried a few other desserts, all of which are delicious.  Pricing is very reasonable here too for a celebrity-owned Vegas restaurant. Portions are decent, unlike many other higher-end restaurants.",

    "text": "1.5 stars  So no one told us that you could starve to death on a Monday night in Vegas. After midnight, we gratefully stumbled in, happy to get anything at all to eat.   Hopes were high. Although this place is in the middle of the casino, the design feels chic and modern. But then reality set in.  The waitress actually snickered at my husband's cocktail order, and it wasn't even a girly drink! He was a bit taken aback. (The weird thing is, the waitress snickered again later, a propos of nothing. So I think the snickering is some nervous tic, an unfortunate one when you're dealing with the public, but nothing personal.)  We ordered the Italian sausage pizza. How to put this? It was awful: a drooping, oily, tasteless mess. It was not possible, physically or psychologically, to eat it.  We got the hell out of WPB&G as eagerly as we had gotten into it. One star for nice design, half a star just for being open, minus three stars for crimes against pizza.",

Each one was perfect and next time I am going to get the spaghetti and meatballs. Wife had the tuna salad sandwich which was very good.

    "text": "I was excited to finally venture out of the typical Vegas-buffet dining in my first Vegas trip minus parental units.  The moderately priced Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is the best way to enjoy a fine-dining experience without breaking the bank.    The atmosphere of the restaurant was very welcoming and casual-chic, and I liked that it wasn't entirely closed off and had an 'open-air' feel relative to the rest of the hotel floor.  It's great for people-watching, quiet enough to have a chat but not too quiet that anyone would have an awkward time.    My best road-trip buddy J got straight to business and ordered moules frites (mussels and fries) done in the traditional white wine, tomato-basil Meridian style.  Served with bread slathered in a bearnaise, WPB&G got this classic just right.  Mussels were meaty, and PLENTIFUL, the fries were herbed and crisp.  The juicy stock leftover from the mussels portion was great to eat with bread.  Our male contingent sprung for the market-priced fish of the day, which was pan-seared and served in a tomato broth of sorts akin to a bouillabaisse.  Unfortunately, he got the 'worst pick of the night' reward, because the tomato sauce drowned out the delicate taste of the fish.  My order?  I chose the most disgusting thing on the menu--calves liver.  But guess what.  It was good.  The hickory and glazed crust lent a certain sweetness that hid the livery taste...well, up until the last 1/4 piece when I couldn't finish it because it was just too much.  That it was served with crispy onion strings, cipollinis, sauteed spinach and pancetta definitely helped as well.  I would definitely come here again to try the seasonal items, and sample the tasting menu!",

I picked this place because of the high rating on Yelp and it seemed like a low key place to eat right before catching Zumanity across the street at NYNY.   For some reason after taking a quick glance at the menu, the gf and I weren't feeling the food. Maybe because it was \"bar\" food and we've been eating Earl of Sandwich everyday since we got into town. It took a while to decide, but we decided to split the butter lettuce caesar salad and the entree of organic chicken. We also ordered the honey lime aid; perfect for those into sour drinks.  The portions are huuuuge so it was good we split the food. Very simple and traditional take on classic dishes.   Service is fast; there's so many waiters attending to you and some even dressed in suits!",

The hostess at a time had walked someone to the table, but she had to come back to grab some menus and didn't say, \"I'll be right with you\" or something along the sort, which would have been thoughtful to make the guest feel acknowledged. One manager, Steven, was standing in front of me for a second and noticed me peeking at the menu. He then asked if I have been helped yet, which I had not, and walked me over to a table.  My first server--I had forgotten his name--knew menu items like it was nothing. My order came out promptly: First, the house salad, which was perfectly seasoned, not drenched in dressing. The tomatoes were not overly ripe. Second, the butternut squash ravioli, topped with a yummy salmon filet (or choice of chicken or shrimp) where you actually get the option on how \"well done\" you would like it. That's a first! I was skeptical about trying this pasta combination, but the aged balsamic on the ravioli complimented the salmon VERY well. It almost tasted like a sweet, fig glaze. Mind you, the entire service, even if I was on a call, my new server Reiko can constantly checking on me, without coming off as intrusive. He was always polite and smiling when he visited. As for the dessert, I would have liked to seen a more elegant plating. The glaze looked like they took a spoonful and dumped it on the plate, then tapped the spoon around. I feel a consistent or neater design would elevate the presentation.",

I found the toppings to be a bit on the stingy side and there was hardly enough cheese to call it a pizza. It is better than the airplane food. But with all the great vegas restaurants this place needs to up its quality or quantity of toppings to beat out the competition. California pizza kitchen does it better just a few stores down for s lower price, more toppings and also better packaging for travel.",

All four in our party ordered the drink special which was some kind of Pear drink.  It was very good but a little on the sweet side for me.  Kind of expensive for being a special.  $18 each I think.  Our waiter told me about a 20 oz. New York Steak special that was not listed on the menu, that came with Mashed Potatoes and Creamed  Spinach for $78.  A little too much money for me at lunch so I passed on it.  Then he said they had the same thing but with a 12 oz. Steak for $48 he thought.  So I ordered that.  Then he said it might be $52, I said that was still ok.  Then after he took all of our orders, he came back out and told me it was $56.  This is the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.    My Wife ordered the Prime Hamburger and said it was really good.  She loved the nice char that it had.  She said it could have used a little more sauce.  My Steak was cooked perfectly and was really good.  It didn't need a steak sauce but the steak sauce was very good also.  The Mashed Potatoes were very creamy and good.  I ended up pouring my left over sauce on my potatoes.  Great place with great food. Just a little spendy for lunch.  But it's Vegas, baby!",

My friend had the crab cakes and mashed potatoes which she thoroughly enjoyed.  My pasta was amazing and topped with Parmesan instead of the whipped ricotta.  In addition to the bread they serve, Kelly also provided us with garlic cheese toast which was perfect with my pasta.  Thanks again Kelly for taking such good care of our late night hunger.",

Pepperoni pizza rings in at $20; it in no way compares to the pizza that we ordered during our last outing. These two items plus a glass of wine came to $52.  I wouldn't return unless there were no other options. Better food can be had at a more modest price, even on the strip.  Service was fine, but nothing exceptional. The resto is in the casino, so it's loud.",

And this is actually a less expensive version of Wolfgang Puck dining.  Everything at the table was unbelievable.  The winning dishes were probably the burger and the rigatoni in bolonese.  Prosciutto pizza was top notch also.    The drinks were amazing too.  Definitely recommend!!",

Late diners beware that it closes at 10 on weekdays, and if you walk in anytime near closing, you won't even e seated at a restaurant table. We walked in around 9:30 and were told the bar seats were our only option. No problemo, we are simple diners and just needed a quick bite after a long, arduous day in Sin City.    As a self-described brussel sprouts aficionado, I would say - DO NOT order the Brussels and Bacon. They were glazed with some type of sweetish sauce that was just not good. I took one bite and then decided that I would reluctantly pick out and eat all of the bacon (which my friend didn't seem bothered by). Then I just prodded and pushed the sprouts all around the plate, which is when our bartender seemed to take notice. He asked how things were and we gave him our honest response and he offered to remove them from our bill - an offer that we happily accepted.   The Wolfgang Cabernet was delicious and paired well with the Rigatoni that I ordered. Michelle had the mushroom ravioli which she said was good (I took her word for it because I loathe mushrooms).   Those with gluten allergies will happily enjoy Wolfgang's gluten-free menu, and those looking for a quick bite to eat in a no-frills version of an \"upper scale\" dining spot should be satisfied with Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill!",

I sat at the bar and had a beer and the crab cake appetizer. It included 4 small crab cakes which were awesome. I followed that with some sort of Pita, not wanting to break the bank with a larger entree in addition to the appetizer, and the pita was pretty good. You can tell that the prices, hours, service, and quality of this place are popular with semi-regulars to the strip, as the people at the bar sitting next to me included a camera man for the fights and two other guys who were there with the press or a sponsor, so this is the sort of high end working mans gourmet dining option of choice. The atmosphere, service, and value were great and the hours make this an excellent place to stop for a lunch or late late lunch before attending an event or while taking a break from a meeting or conference.",

I had a horrible experience trying to book another dinner for that same weekend where a restaurant was requiring a sign a contract and put down a deposit for a group of 16 and was pushing me around from person to person. I thought that was ridiculous, but Vegas requires weird things like paying for the first night of your hotel in advance, so I thought maybe this was another Vegas thing.

The meat was moist and tender. Garlic mashed potatoes were great. Honeyed carrots and string beans retained their crunchiness and flavor. Unfortunately, due to the large serving, the flavors got really monotonous after a while, and I gave up on about a third of the chicken. My friend had the raviola, which was injected with some kind of rich cheese and broth, and topped with more rich sauce. Again, much too rich after the initial explosion of flavors.",

For my main I had the agnolotti, these wonderful little bite-sized ravioli type pastas that were filled with a tangy artichoke & 3 cheese puree, topped with darling little green clover looking parsley...DELICIOUS! I would definitely eat here again if I ever return to Vegas...My husband had the flank steak topped with a oozey yummy lump of blue cheese and fries...he liked it =). For dessert we shared the 3 sorbet in brandy snaps COVERED in berries....it was SO DELICIOUS. Amazing. My husband had a beer & glass of wine, I had a non-alcoholic Mojito...For all this we got out with a check of $97. Not too bad considering how delicious we found everything to be!

She ordered the burger medium.  It took a very long time for our food to arrive and when it did, her burger was cooked very well done.  The waiter offered to have another burger made.  We had waited quite a while, and everyone was nearly done with their meals, all of us sharing with my sister-in-law whom still had no burger.  The waiter came by and my sister-in-law said to just cancel the order because we had already waited too long for it.  He said that he would take care of it.  A few minutes later, someone who appeared to be a manager came to the table delivering the burger we had already asked to be removed from the order.  My sister in law, frustrated at this point stated \"No, I don't want it now\".  The manager walked away.  A few minutes later I noticed the manager with a waiter standing in the middle of the restaurant pointing at our table and mocking my sister-in-law like a school yard bully.  I very discreetly informed our waiter that I thought it was highly inappropriate for his manager to behave in such a way.  Moments later the manager stormed up to our table and began raising his voice at me and scolding me for my \"perception\" about what had taken place.  He then went on to blame the whole incident on the waiter, who had done nothing wrong.  I won't be back.",

I came to the MGM location on a double date during lunch time, and they have a pretty extensive menu at the expected price range.   I ordered the white pizza, which was topped with ricotta, caramelized onions, garlic, chicken, and spinach. I loved that the pizza was not overly creamy, and the ingredients were just the right amount to not overwhelm the thin crust. My boyfriend had the burger, which had a hefty patty that was cooked perfectly. The seeded bun was a nice touch, and the shoestring fries were crispy but not oily. My best friend had the chinois salad, which was also an extremely generous size. The flavors were great, and the dressing was not too heavy as to overwhelm the veggies. Her boyfriend ordered the fish and chips, breaded to the ideal ratio and revealing perfectly flaky fish in the inside. Overall, we had a really satisfying meal that didn't overwhelm our stomachs and left our tastebuds happy!",

For dessert, I ordered the chocolate souffle because I saw a yelper post the dessert picture. My sugar addiction immediately  kicked in and said I've got to have one of these.

I'm typically the type of person who has to have meat to feel satisfied, but that dish satisfies every taste bud. Anyways I wanted Spago's, but didn't want to trek my way down the strip in 110 degree weather so I decided to give Wolfgang's restaurant at the MGM Grand since I was staying at the hotel. Menu here had similar items as the cafe menu at Spago's. For starters we tried the truffled potato chips with blue cheese. It was good, but not sure if I would order it again. Felt there wasn't much to it just potato chips topped with a truffle cream sauce and chunks of blue cheese. For the main course my boyfriend and I ordered the sausage pizza with a sliced peppers, white sauce and a green veggie that I think was either kale or spinach and we also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti and meatballs tasted almost exactly the same as the spaghettini at Spago's but with meatballs. Meatballs were soft, melt in your mouth deliciousness. Flavor in the sauce was on point. Pasta was homemade (A MUST!). Perfect texture. Thank you Wolfgang for providing food consistently at both restaurants.",

The pearfect martini is incredibly refreshing & flavorful. If you have time for dinner, try the carmelized cauliflower and house made gnocchi. Both dishes are fantastic and just the right portion size. Even though those are the only two dishes I've tried, everything else I've seen looks equally impressive.

Another reason I rated this place 5 stars was that their Menus weren't greasy. Many restaurants have fancy menus but they are very greasy and covered in oil because they never change them.  The place is also pretty clean. We had a Japanese American waiter that always refilled our water. My son has an egg allergy so we asked the waiter if their pasta has eggs. The waiter said that they had eggs but he suggested that we could get rice noodles that were gluten free. We said no thanks so we asked him for a grilled cheese sandwich and asked if there bread has eggs. The waiter checked then said it has no eggs but then he said the fries that come with the grilled cheese are fried in the same basket as the calamari which is covered in egg coating. We said it was ok.  We enjoyed the food very much. I would recommend this restaurant to other people. Again, the only thing is that the food is a bit pricey.",

After being sat, someone came by and filled water glasses for us, but it was at least another ten minutes before someone talked to us.  I still don't know if he was our actual waiter or not.  He didn't introduce himself, didn't ask what we wanted to drink and didn't mention any specials.  All he said was, \"were you ready to order?\"  I've had better service at Steak n' Shake.  No, we were not ready to order, but the beer I was going to spend $9 dollars on all of a sudden didn't seem worth it.  Also, changed my mind on not getting the $36 meal and just sticking with an appetizer.  After realizing the service was going to suck, we wanted to get a snack and get out.  So I got the crab cakes, wife got a salad and we shared the bleu cheese chips (that they forgot about and brought out after everything else).  We left satisfied with the food, all of it was very good, but what a service disaster.  I would expect this is not the rule here and would go back based on the quality of the food.",

Not to mention, the plate can easily be shared between two if you aren't super hungry (but you know you need something in your stomach to deter a potential hangover in the morning).   Grilled Steak and Eggs with Tuscan Potatoes and Herb Hollandaise Sauce. Mmm doesn't that just sound good to you?   The steak, ordered medium rare, was cooked beautifully (none of that tough dry steak nonsense here). Loved how as soon as I cut into the meat with my steak knife, the firm flesh revealed a warm red center. Juicy, flavorful, well-seaseoned deliciousness.  My friend and I asked for sun side up eggs, which were perfect for eating right over toast (you can choose sourdough, wheat or white, served with butter or jam on the side), and them tuscan potatoes were bombdiggity. They reminded me of smashed potatoes except they were prepared in a way where crispiness was not compromised. Dip with ketchup and you've struck gold.   I don't think I could eat steak and eggs anywhere else... I've been spoiled so. I'll be sure to return the next time I'm in Vegas for crazy drunken shenanegans!",

I ordered the chicken soup, which they modified to accommodate my allergies and the half chicken. I was SO PLEASED with their attention to detail, care for my allergies and fast service. The experience, atmosphere and food was IMPECCABLE.  We were so happy we called the manager John over to thank him and commend the wonderful service from Daren.  In return,  he offered desert for the table. I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas thanks to this. I'm so thankful and I'm absolutely in love with Wolfgang Puck. Come by, you will be so happy you did!! #wolfgangpuck #wolfgang #amazing #food #vegas",

For $15, I'd say it's a steal for vegas and very generous portions! I'm totally going back for more next time!",

It didn't seem busy and there were several tables open but I waited. After being seated, We were given three different waiters that were not of much help when asking for recommendations. The food I ordered was pretty but, lacked flavor. Of the items I ordered, the only edible one was the mac n cheese. It's hard to screw that up so I wasn't surprised that it tasted good. The ambience of the restaurant is very casual and neighboring tables are very close. I would not recommend this place and found it to be a last resort.",

This time I was pressed for time and it was the only place that didnt have an excruciatingly long wait time and I'm glad I gave them a second shot.  The staff was AMAZINGLY nice and attentive.  I swear the waiter must have been watching our table and only our table that night.  It felt like my water glass was being refilled every time I took 3 sips.  I also mentioned that me and boyfriend were sharing everything and they went ahead and split each dish for us ahead of time.  Great service and attention at its best!  Chicken Noodle Soup - who orders Chicken Noodle Soup in Vegas?  This gal thats who!  And if you do too then you wont be disappointed.  The soup is very light and not overly sodiumified (is that a word? oh well)  12 oz Ribeye - A little salty but chargrilled to perfection.  The side potatoes were also quite yummy.  We stopped the waiter to ask him how they were made. Its a 3 step process that allows the potatoes to be soft and mealy inside while being amazingly crispy on the outside.  If they served these with a sauce I could just order these as an appetizer all on their own.  Another good thing about this place...open all night.  You can get gourmet food at 3am instead of your regular ole greasy pizza.",

My wife raised her hand during our conversation and the manager came over to see if she needed anything.  That's service.  Love the space IF you are seated in the right direction.  Only negative is that some sight lines look right out on the casino floor.  When I dine, I'd rather have a break from the slot machines.

I took between 2 and 7 people and everyone had nothing but great things to say about their food and experience. The chicken  noodle soup tasted like it had just been made on the farm by grandma. The chicken salad sandwich was superb. They make their own chips there and they were great.  Try Wolfgang s when you're there - you can't go wrong!",

    "text": "\"You better shut your mouth,\" I told him, trying not to sound like Brandon St. Randy. \"That has to be a lie.\"  But no, my husband assured me he was telling the truth. If Yelp was to be believed, there was a Wolfgang Puck restaurant open until 6 a.m. We'd been burned by high-end late night dining before - places closed during dead times, menus more limited than even the limited ones advertised. But still, we are night owls, and we desperately want to believe in something other than cafe fare or Thai at 2 a.m.  \"But it's Wolfgang Puck,\" I dithered. See, we had once watched Puck rather gleefully butcher a duck on a late night talk show. Mike and I love ducks. We don't eat ducks. We had decided right then that we didn't care for someone who could laugh while using a cleaver on one.  But we were also hungry. And, let's face it, all of our favourite chefs butcher ducks. We just don't happen to see them. And we do love trying new places...  \"I'm not going to sit in some trendy high stool with my short legs swinging,\" I told Mike in the car. \"And I don't want to deal with a bunch of clubbers talking loudly and importantly about their own awesomeness at the next table,\" I warned him. \"And if it's loud, forget it.\"  We were shown to a comfortable (if slightly small) two-top in an unpretentious open area where we could watch casinogoers pass by. (Surprisingly, it wasn't noisy.) Even though it was just after 11, we got the full menu.  Mike began with the \"Chinois Chicken Salad, Candied Peanuts, Crisp Wontons, Chinese Mustard Vinaigrette.\" I had a chopped vegetable salad. Mine was very nice, but Mike's salad got frothy adjectives from the first bite until, well, if you were to ask him about it now, I'm sure he could still give a five-minute talk on its virtues. They should schedule him for the next TED conference, honestly.  Mike continued his theme with the Crispy Chicken Milanese, declared to be \"really, really good\" (because he was out of words after that salad). I had a sort of mushroom Stroganoff with green beans, and I have to say \"sort of\" because it isn't on the online menu and I'm having to look at photos to jog my memory because my memory just refers to it as YUM YUM NOM NOM.   I didn't scrape my plate clean, much as I wanted to, because everything was so delicious that we had to save room for dessert. (The leftover pasta made a fine lunch the next day. How often can you rave about the taste of the pasta and actually be referring to the noodle, not the entire dish? That's how good it was - I was gushing about the taste of the noodle itself!)  To reluctantly finish what was an unexpected taste bonanza, Mike ordered the caramelized lemon meringue pie (with blueberries). I ordered the cherry cheesecake with pistachios (also not on the online menu). We both then ordered our butler to kidnap Wolfgang Puck and force him to be our personal chef. (Because in the fantasy where we can afford Wolfgang Puck as our personal chef, we can also afford a butler. Although our True fantasy at this point was probably a private chauffeur, then we could've spooned in the back of the limo, basking in the afterglow of such a meal.)  I don't know if I can forgive Puck about the duck, but cognitive dissonance is no problem when your brain's being pumped full of happiness chemicals after a meal like this.",

Probably some of the best food I can remember eating in Vegas. I ordered the prosciutto pizza which had kalamata olives, oven-dried tomatoes, goat cheese and a drizzle of basil pesto ... This was heaven on a plate!  If you've read my other reviews, you know I have a serious relationship with olives, especially on my pizza. Mmmm....It was delish! My friend had the half chicken and it came out looking pretty amazing as well.  I thought prices were really reasonable (considering it's Vegas and in a hotel) and service was good. I would definitely make an attempt to eat here again on a future trip to Vegas!",

IMO, it was the best meal of our trip so far. Here is what we ordered:  1. Spicy Tuna Tartare, Avocado, Pickled Ginger, Cucumber, Crisp Sesame Wontons  2. Truffled Potato Chips, Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce  3. Agnolotti with Asparagus, Smoked Ham, Fresh Ricotta and Parmesan  4. Fish of the day (halibut) with sweet corn puree, blue crab and lobster cause americaine.  Everything was amazing and the service was super good.  The only shortfall is that it's a bit loud because it's located on the casino floor. But the food was so food you really don't notice it too much.",

Let me start by saying I sat there for a while before my drink order was taken. After I ordered my phone was nearly dead and my charger wasn't working, I asked if he had one behind the bar I was told no but later saw there was one all along.   The bartender was polite but put everyone at the bar before me for some reason. I kept having to call him over for more water & tea. It seemed as though he thought I wouldn't tip as much as the others or something.  That wasn't even the worst part... The food was bland bland bland.  I ordered the roasted chicken with Yukon potatoes and creamed spinach. The portion was big but the food had absolutely no flavor. The tea was the best part of my meal. If in Vegas I recommend sushi samba, joes stone crab or any other restaurant besides this! I definitely won't be going back.",

Started with the truffle potato chips and the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla.   The soup was very good. Great cumin and corn taste.  Couldn't stop eating it.  The potato chips were close to the best dish of the night.  The potato chips were fried to perfection.  The MayTag blue cheese sauce was awesome along with the MayTag crumbles.  The truffle oil tied it all together.    The wife ordered the pea tortellini with a white wine butter sauce, pea shoots and English peas.  It was pea-riffic.  The stuffing in the tortellini was so good.  So sweet and rich.  The sauce was the same way.  She licked the plate.  I ordered the ricotta gnocchi bolognese.  Best gnocchi I have ever had.  So soft and delicious.  Was not pasty.  The sausage bolognese was spot on.  Great tomato sauce with a mild Italian sausage.  I could eat two portions.    We finished with the chocolate souffle.  It was worth the 20 minute wait.  So airy and delicious chocolate.  Served with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream.  The server tops it with all of that and then you dig in.  Delicious!!!  Will return over and over.",

Sorry to be of little help here. I'm trying to catch up on my Yelping and this isn't quite as fresh in my memory as it was before the four Sailor Jerry and Coke Zeros I've consumed. Just joshing.

    "text": "***Not as expensive or overpriced as the many celebrity chef restaurants in Las Vegas (though still pricey), Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is a decent spot that serves satisfying (though not great) food***  Despite the many well-known restaurants (especially those backed by celebrity chefs) in Las Vegas, there are not many that are open for lunch.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, which is located on the casino floor of the MGM hotel, so convenient.  I believe it is open all day and Wolfgang Puck utilizes better ingredients than a lot of its daytime sit-down competition.  Despite its convenience, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is just an okay restaurant (not a great one).  Most of the dishes are fine and taste good, but I have yet to have something here (in my 3 visits) that felt noticeably better than the food other good Vegas restaurants put out.  Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill sits smack down in the middle of the casino.  It is pretty open to the casino with no big walls.  Maybe it was where we sat or that the casino was not that busy, but the smoke-filled casino did not feel that obtrusive here.  The decor has the look of a bright cafe with light yellow and golden brown colors and nice but casual tables and chairs.  We started with the truffled (strong truffle flavor) potato chips, which were topped with a chunky and rich Maytag blue cheese sauce.  The housemade chips were flavorful and seasoned right but unevenly crisp--some were crisp and some were soft (some chips were made even softer / soggier due to the heavy coating of blue cheese).  Overall, it was an okay starter though you may want to steer clear if you are not a fan of blue cheese.  We also shared the Chinois Chicken Salad, which was tossed with candied peanuts, crisp wontons and a Chinese mustard vinaigrette.  Overall, it was a flavorful and fresh salad with a good balance of ingredients, but it was not as good as the original Chinois Chicken Salad from Chinois on Main in Santa Monica.  The reason was that the salad was over dressed.  It kind of lost its crispness and it was overdressed in the vinaigrette (too soggy).  For my entree, I had the BLT, which included maple glazed pork belly, arugula, vine ripe tomatoes, and avocado on buttered sourdough toast.  The pork belly was sweet and flavorful.  I thought it was going to be braised and soft (and then crispy on the outside); however, the pork belly here lacked that tender texture.  Instead, the pork belly's texture was more dense like thick bacon or lean spare ribs.  It was still good, but I would have preferred a thicker piece of braised (tender) pork belly over the spare rib-like texture here.  The lettuce, tomato and avocado were all fine.  Like the potato chips, the sandwich was heavily dressed.  I was not a big fan of the sourdough.  The bread was okay, but it was over-buttered and slightly greasy.  The BLT came with a side of cold vegetable pasta salad, which was a standard cold pasta salad.  I tried my friend's kabocha pumpkin tortellini with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan.  I had a very similar pumpkin tortellini dish at Drago Ristorante in Santa Monica.  The pasta dish at Wolfgang Puck was flavorful and pretty good (probably the best thing we had here).  That being said, I liked Drago's version better because it was lighter, had a more subtle flavor and was less complicated.  Service was very good.  The waiter Jeremy was a very nice guy.  He was pleasant and friendly as well as enthusiastic and passionate about the food.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  Prices for lunch were okay.  There were several options here that were around $20 or less.  You would pay about the same at some of the Las Vegas cafes, but I imagine you are more likely to walk away satisfied if you spent your money here.  Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill has convenient hours and puts out tasty (though not remarkable) food.  I've been here a few times and the restaurant has shown a lot of consistency in delivering (at the very least) decent food.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill a decent and safe option for lunch in Las Vegas.    The MGM Grand hotel provides complimentary parking (both valet and self-parking via a parking structure).",

    "text": "Girls' Night Out at Wolfgang Puck at MGM.  This was my first time here, or at any of Wolfie's restaurants, for that matter.  I loosened up with a nice Prosecco.    The four of us shared three entrees:  the mushroom and leek pizza, the Chinoise salad, and a huge chicken schnitzel.  Before the food arrived, we munched on the fabulous bread, and I could have filled up on that.  But I'm glad I didn't.  The salad wasn't my choice, and I wasn't expecting to like it; I don't like to lard it up my salads with fried wonton strips, and the candied part of the peanuts wasn't enticing.  I like my peanuts straight, thank you.  The dressing was described as having a Chinese mustard base, which I always skip.  But, voila, it all worked, and it was fantastic - I wished the portion had been larger.  But the size of the schnitzel more than made up for it:  it was huge, freshly fried, hot, and not dried out, and covered with an arugula salad with cherry tomatoes that topped it to perfection.  Five stars on both of them.  The pizza, which brought ol' Wolfgang his fame, was a disappointment.  Oh, the topping was wonderful: plenty of dark, earthy mushrooms and a terrific taglio-something cheese.  But the crust wasn't baked enough.  We sent it back, and its replacement was baked a bit more, but it was still droopy and missing something.  Then I realized that the texture was completely different from the hardened semolina wheat I trained my chops on in a lifetime in New York.  This pizza crust could never rival that, no matter how long it was in the oven.  The wheat is just too soft.  Service was excellent, from the waiter, manager, and busboy.  Before check time came, I asked about the 20% discount offered to locals that I had read about just recently.  The waiter said they didn't offer it.  He sent the manager over without us asking, who repeated that it wasn't an option, but that they do offer locals a free dessert for every two people.  So who'd pass on dessert, even though we really didn't want it.  (Well, my FRIENDS didn't want it, but I have no will power).  We ordered the Valrona chocolate torte, and ice cream with berries in a crispy shell.  It took all of my strength to leave a bit of that chocolate cake on the plate and waddle out of the restaurant.  The highlight was when my friend surprised us and paid the bill with her points.  That was an even better dessert!!!",

    "text": "Came for dinner. We chose to come here because it was the closest restaurant with a good variety of food at affordable (for Vegas) prices. The decor is modern and the tables are exposed to the casino floor but are comfortably far enough to not feel like your being watched by passers-by. We started with the beef skewers and calamari. The calamari was delicate and seasoned nicely. The breading could have used a tiny bit more crunch. The skewers were cooked to a perfect med-rare and still managed to have some char marks on the outside. Drawback, the meat is fatty and can be gristley and can't necessarily be bitten off the skewer without having to gnaw on it for a minute. Pretty embarrassing if your making out with a skewer in front of others because you're trying to pull off a bite. Best forego the skewer stick and use a knife and fork. I had the Chicken Jadori with cauliflower instead of mash pot. The chicken was delicious. It was an open, almost entirely deboned half chicken (only thigh bone), that was seasoned and broiled creating a wonderfully crisp seasoned crust that contrasted the juicy hot chicken underneath. The dish was great with texture, freshness and portion. The flavor was on point but about half way through gets a bit salty from the crisped seasoning. I was ok with it though. Very satisfied with what we ate.",

Working in the restaurant business, I tend to be a bit snobby and prissy when it comes to service at other restaurants and usually, I'm disappointed.  This was NOT one of those experiences.    I was staying at the MGM and attending a conference and didn't want to venture far for lunch.  After a horrible lunch experience at Emeril's on my first day of the conference, I decided to give Wolfgang's a try on day two.  And it was such a pleasant experience, I came back on Day 3 as well.   First visit: - We were greeted pleasantly by the hostess  - Sat a nice table near the glass  - promptly greeted by our server (Jeremy) who thoroughly explained the specials and also recommended a cocktail.  The Pearfict Martini thing was great!  - We were in a bit of a rush, so we ordered quickly.  Two of us had pizzas and one had a shrimp scampi thing.  Everything was pretty awesome.    - All food came out in a very timely manner and waters/drinks were refilled even through the entire restaurant was completely full for lunch.    - The support staff (bussers/runners) were great and Jeremy was very attentive and on-point as well.    - We were in and out of the restaurant in 40 minutes and still had time to get some Starbucks before we headed back to the conference.    Second Visit: - Jeremy was actually near the entrance to greet us and recognized us and sat us in his section.  Restaurant was almost empty.    - Quickly ordered some food.  Had the Cheesy Potato Chips thing.  They were pretty darn good, but also very rich.  Too much for two people.  I had a pepperoni pizza and she had a caesar salad.  Salad was average.  Not amazing, just good.  Pizza was good, just like the day before.   - Service was, once again, great.    Overall, the staff seems very professional, detailed and well-put-together.  I was impressed to find such good service in a \"casual\" las vegas eatery.    Thanks for the awesome service and great food.",

My husband and I sat at the bar and were quickly attended. I ordered a lemon drop which tasted Like heaven. Let me tell ya I'm SUUUPPEEERRRR picky with my lemon drops. We ordered a few apps, tuna tartare, crab cakes and calamari. Enjoyed every single one of them. Only wished the crab cakes were slightly bigger. The tuna tartare was our favorite we can order a whole bowl of this stuff and we'd keep eating and eating. Overall experience was amazing. We are never disappointed. Until next time",

I made a reservation a few weeks in advance for the group and thought that it would be more difficult with such a large group but Wolfgang Puck made it extremely easy. The food was excellent- we shared some appetizers (chicken wings, Brussel sprouts, etc.) and I had the butternut squash ravioli for dinner. The service was great and the birthday boys even got their own free desserts, which were delicious I might add. Overall it was a wonderful dining experience and I'm glad we chose Wolfgang Puck for our celebratory dinner.",

The shrimp on the pizza was good but the dough was paper thin and the crust was tough. The crab cakes however were a lot better. The presentation was nice and they were packed with a ton of flavor. I've always wanted to try this place and I'm happy I did. I'll probably give Wolfgang Pucks another try but with a different dish.",

    "text": "The finer things in greater variety.  Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is a bit misleading in it's complexity.  One quick look would expect a great place to grab a quick drink and some pub food, and you wouldn't be wrong in that regard, but you'd miss the other amazing entrees covering seafood, pasta, and more.  I started my meal with the tuna tartar.  The fish was packed with flavor, topped with fresh avocado and a spicy sriracha aioli sauce that blended savory and spicy with just a hint of tart.  For my main course, I split their mushroom pizza and seafood pasta.  The pizza, more catered to the bar lover's food, consisted of a variety of wild mushrooms, layered evenly so that each bit had a different flavor, then topped with a black truffle sauce for added punch.  The seafood pasta was loaded with shrimp, scallops, and fish, covered in a creamy tomato sauce that felt rich and satisfying.    And while you can get free drinks at any of the slot machines, I recommend enjoying one of Wolfgang's cocktails.  Their moscow mule was packed with smooth vodka that went down easy and refreshed me for a night of partying.    Wolfgang is a fantastic way to start an evening of debauchery or relaxation while you're in Vegas.",

Maybe the wait staff are told to get customers in, make them spend lots of money, and get them out as fast as possible.  We came in for a late meal, after 10pm. There were plenty of seats.   When we ordered just two appetizers, Kristin pressed, \"Are you not very hungry? Maybe you two could split a salad, too.\" Umm, no thanks. We know how hungry we are.   Making this review two stars because at least our food was good. The wings were solid - though not the best I had in LV - and the crab cakes were moist. But they were way over priced for the size, which was basically 4 mini bites. Thank goodness there was (hard) bread to eat.  More than 3x did someone come and try to take our plates before we were done. Kristin quickly put down the bill and said, \"There's no rush\" and smiled quickly - but too quick for us to see her scowl.   Maybe she was having a bad day, but a little attitude can go a long way. This meal was memorable - and not for a good reason.",

I had the cranberry mojito which was really delicious. Were they not somewhere just short of $15, I could have easily ordered another...and then another. The husbo and I decided to have appetizer dinner and shared the truffles potato chips, the chicken wings, and the steak skewers. Everything was good, with the skewers being the standout. The only real downside with the food was that it all cooled down a lot after just a couple minutes. Maybe if the plates had been warmer or the food hotter, it wouldn't have been as much of an issue.   It wasn't a cheap meal, but nothing is in Vegas. Our server was really friendly and quick and someone else was doing a great job keeping our dirty plates cleared and our water full. All in all, lukewarm food aside, it was a good first meal in Vegas.",

The Cobb salad had good amounts of everything, super quality ingredients. However, I found the vinaigrette very assertive with acid. If I ate more than two bites of lettuce without something else between, my tongue was burning.  Friends split a burger, one with cheese and one without, they did split plate, super cute. Friend tried $16 Old Fashioned after she spied the oak cask on the bar and asked about it. She thought it was excellent.  Thanks Wolfgang, another splendid meal. Total was $90 plus tip.",

We made an RSVP for 6:00pm since we had to catch a show at 8:00pm. Our server was a young gentleman named Shawn. He was great. Very friendly, professional, knowledgeable and overall made our experience here amazing.      Time to order drinks, Shawn recommend a great glass of wine and my God son just had an ice tea. We started with a Chinois chicken salad (split). I was very impressed, it was as good as the one we had at the Chinois in Santa Monica, California. We also had the steak skewers and fried Calamari as an appetizer and it was yummy.   For our main dish, I ordered the Rigatoni for my entree and my God son had the prosciutto pizza (the crust was to die for). They were both delicious. Tons of great flavors and I would highly recommend them. The servings were great sizes, and we were both stuffed.     Shawn (our server) asked if we wanted desert and we were both too stuffed, but he did recommend a couple of good ones. I told him, we'll be back soon and well be sure to leave room for desert next time.   If you are staying/visiting MGM and looking for something to eat, I highly recommend Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill. Make sure you ask for Shawn, he's amazing!",

It's located across from the KA Theater so it's really easy to find.    We had great service all night long.  He gave us great suggestions and very attentive throughout.  He told us the drink special they had that evening.  It was Buffalo Trace Bourbon, root beer and chocolate shavings.  I'm not a bourbon drinker but I actually ordered a second one because it was so good.    I chose the Rigatoni for my entree.  It was fantastic mixed with fennel sausage bolognese, parmesan and fresh ricotta.  There was no way I wasn't going to finish it.  My husband had ordered the Grilled Prime Burger.  Of course I had to try a bite.  It was juicy and satisfying.  I loved the onion marmalade spread on the burger.  Really made it pop.    Since we come to the strip for various shows, I can see us visiting again really soon.  Thanks for a great dinner!",

The pizza my husband got was over 20 for a personal and we've had better pizza by the slice. The corn agnolotti pasta I got was good, but was the tiniest serving. Thankfully we had an appetizer, that helped my hunger. We got the tuna sashimi, and I thought it was good, loved the crispy wontons. My husband wasn't as impressed. Overall, the food was just sub par for the pricing. I expect to be wowed at these restaurants with a well known chef attached. The only superior thing about the restaurant was the service. Our waiter was attentive, quick, and had a great personality. Very kind and funny.",

It was nice that we were able to have a semi private room, that made things nice as our dinner was absent of a lot of the noise and bustle that I usually associate with Vegas!    We shared a couple appetizers, the crispy Jidori chicken wings and the Fritto Misto.  Both were solid but nothing spectacular.  If I had to reorder again, I'd probably skip the wings as they don't seem to be worth the price.  For my main dish I got the Maine Lobster Fettuccine.  That was a great dish, pretty generous with the amount of lobster.  The tomato sherry cream sauce was great too.  Pricey dish, but nice if you want to splurge.  For dessert, we shared the Passionfruit Cheesecake.  Yum.  I love passionfruit, so I'd definitely order that again!  The sweetness of the cheesecake, the tartness of the passionfruit, and the texture of the coconut flakes were a nice blend.",

It was a nice restaurant and all of the staff greeted us as we arrived and went to our table.  We tried the steak skewers as an appetizer. They were good, but not great. I wish we had gotten the chips instead. I ordered a prosciutto pizza and enjoyed it. They didn't short you any meat on the pizza. It was the prefect size for me. Halfway thru my meal a waiter walked up to me and offered Parmesan and crushed red pepper, but you would have thought they would have offered it earlier when I had first gotten the pizza. My girlfriend really enjoyed her pasta and I liked the bite that I tried as well.   You are going to pay Vegas prices here, but it was a nice meal and we enjoyed it. It's worth a try and pretty quick meal for as quality of a meal as it is.",

FOOD We had the Steak Skewers and the wings. The former was alright. It was a little undercooked for me. They should probably start asking people how they would like them cooked. The wings, on the other hand, were really good and the sauce is delicious. The calamari was really good too. I guess there are fried lemon in there. My dad and brother had them. My dad liked it but my brother didn't. I didn't get a chance to try it, but I might like it. Beware of the hidden lemon when you order this appetizer.  CLEAN Everything seemed pretty clean, no complaints here.  Overall, I might go back to try some other food.",

They have a decent menu where there is a selection of appies, mains, and desserts.  The service is attentive and friendly.  The place is spacious with lots of seating spread apart from each other and some have a view of the casino.   The waiter gave us complimentary warm bread and butter to start, which was nice.  We had the prime hamburger. It may be the sauce, because the burger was incredibly flavourful.  It was also guite big and included cheddar and onion marmalade.  It was accompanied by skinny crispy fries on the side.  The chocolate souffle with vanilla ice-cream was a nice finishing touch to the end of the meal.    A bonus of this place is the hours. Mon-Tues, they are open 11:30 am-12 am.  Wed-Fri, they are open from 11:30 am to 6 pm and Sat-Sun  from 11 am to 6 am.  When you want a good late night dinner and everywhere else is closed, this is the place to go.  The price is reasonable too.",

    "text": "WP Bar and Grill @ MGM is still one of THE BEST places to eat in Vegas no matter what time of day it is IMO. AND It's even better if you have a BOGO or $25 comp from the MyVegas app!  Last Saturday was my 3rd time visiting WP @ MGM. We were still a little full from lunch but wanted to eat something before our flight. The hostess and and server were kind enough to seat all 6 of us together and still allow us to use our MyVegas comps (which is usually 1 per table). We really appreciated being able to sit together as this was our last meal in Vegas and we had our toddler and both sets of grandparents with us.  I couldn't be happier with the way everything turned out. We were seated all together at a spacious table and service was EXCELLENT. We decided to order the Margherita and Housemade Italian Sausage pizzas, spaghetti and meatballs and a grilled prime burger. We all agreed the pizzas were delicious. Covered with the perfect amount of cheese and seasonings they had very distinct flavors. We were all surprised by how soft and tasty the crust was. Every now and then I'll leave my crust but it was hard to stop eating. Our son loved the meatballs but the spaghetti had a hint of spiciness which we thought tasted great! The prime burger was fresh, juicy and tender and those golden, crispy fries were hard to waste. We all had a good time and left Vegas with fully belly and happy memories. Thanks again WP for another great experience!",

After 45 minutes im looking at the waiter who is too busy flirting with the hostess not giving a damn that we have gotten no food that i asked \"hey is the food coming soon\". They completely forgot to make it, then the manager comes over to ask whats the problem... with the worst possible attitude. Trying to convince us that it takes so long to bring a half chicken and a pizza. Lost it at that point and we left. No manager should ever come over to customers to convince them they are wrong about waiting an hour for pizza and a chicken. Managers name is Brandon Clayton.",

We waited forever for our waters - the beer we ordered came sooner than the water - and I only got a refill when I was already finished eating. Good thing BF had beer, I could drink his water. Oh, that beer btw was $9. It was Hoegarden on tap, but still. And I don't mind paying the price, but the service was just sucky. I ended up with two lattes on the bill, and when I brought it up, the waiter was a bit pissy about it. I ended up getting a double latte in exchange. My suggestion, btw: give me another latte -didn't ask for double- that you already charged me for, so you don't have fuss with running the card again. They don't seem to have to-go containers for liquids, I had to carry my latte in a lidless soda cup. Fun.",

Service was generally fine as the place wasn't that busy on a Tuesday night at 10.    Started off by ordering the calamari app while i figured out where I was going with the rest of the meal.  It arrived shortly afterwards with a noticeable sheen to it.  I like my fried calamari dry and not glistening.    Talked with the waiter about the specialty pizzas which are a big part of the menu.  He suggested that they were just pizzas, interesting, but  'just pizzas'.  Wound up with the chicken milanese which he suggested would be a decent amount of food.  The entree arrived and was 2 board-like pieces of overdone chicken beast with an arrugula salad with grape tomatos on top.  Made it through just one of them before giving up.  I was pretty disappointed with the flavor and texture of the chicken (too dry).  I had higher hopes for the meal but at least the restaurant affords generally good people watching from most tables.    Note: this was my first Yelp review and expect to wind up with much more to follow.",

We ordered a special appetizer with heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese.  It is similar to a caprese tomato salad.  This tomato dish was incredibly flavorful.  The tomatoes were so fresh and sweet.  Really, I could eat this every day.  It was that good.  It's the main reason we came back a second time.  I thought the price of $18 was a bit high for an appetizer, but my husband and I shared it.  We also ordered their popular spicy chicken pizza which is enough for 2 to share.  It was also made from fresh ingredients.  I would highly recommend the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill as a casual restaurant to go to in Las Vegas.",

We had a party of 12, no reservations and were seated within a few minutes (it was about 9 pm) big plus to start with. Drinks were great and served pretty quickly. I had the calamari appetizer which was cooked just right. Crispy and tender! The fries capers really add something to the dish too. I then shared the pancetta wrapped meatloaf with a friend. Not something I would normaly have but glad I did. really flavorful and the pancetta was a nice change from your standard bacon. This came with some potatoes, super creamy, and brussel sprouts, perfectly seasoned.  A very satisfying meal and for Vegas very reasonable priced. Service was attentive without hovering.  Would definitely return!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on our last day in Vegas and boy was it a good call (on my part haha).  First time eating at any of the Puck restaurants so I was excited and had high expectations.  We got there right when they opened at 11:30am and were seated promptly.  Our waiter was awesome and we always had our waters refilled without having to ask (we always seems to have that problem everywhere we eat out).    Drink: I ordered a non-alcoholic drink called Ginger Lime Iced Tea $6 (I think) and it was pretty mild on the ginger part.  My boyfriend didn't taste the ginger at all.  Despite that, it was a pretty good drink.  Food: Boyfriend ordered a basic pizza $15, fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, basil.  I'm assuming they go light on the sauce already but my boyfriend asked for easy sauce and got practically no sauce but the crust was good enough for my carb crazed man. I ordered the BLT sandwich ($16) because I saw that pork belly was in the mix instead of bacon which is why I've never ordered BLTs to begin with.  I have officially dubbed this sandwich THE FIRST CLASS SANDWICH.  The waiter warned me about what pork belly really is and how it's not like bacon blah blah blah.  I said \"Honey, I know exactly what I'm getting into.  Pork belly is one of my guilty pleasures.  I dunno if the other reviewer who had this was expecting something salty like bacon and actually expected bacon because she kept calling it \"bacon\" (bacon is cured, pork belly is not), but the sandwich they served me was flavorful to it's True taste!!  Somehow it wasn't a messy sandwich to eat because they took the care of prepping their food.  No avocados slipping and sliding, no greasy mess so the bread stayed crispy!  Simple ingredients, nothing complicated. Every bite was HEAVEN!!!!!  I gave my other half to my boyfriend because he was starting to regret not ordering it when he took a bite!  The side pasta salad was awesome, balanced flavors, the olives totally made it!  Overall the great food and service totally made the price worth it and we will definitely be back for more!!",

On the other hand my friends were not so lucky. One ordered the chicken and couldn't tell any difference between that dish and the grilled chicken sold in the college cafeteria. The other had the short rib and it was over-cooked. The most miserable guy had the onion soup which was too salty and the claim pasta, in which the pasta was raw. They were disappointed with the dinner that day. And the price was kind of high especially regarding their dishes. Not recommended if you want to find a good place with budget, but the location, the service and SOME of the dishes were fine.",

We requested a table away from the casino and were given a private table which did not smell like smoke at all! Dinner was delicious. My husband had the rib eye and said it was out of this world. I customized my own meal by having the chopped vegetable salad with grilled chicken and a side of steamed brussel sprouts. It was perfect! This place will accommodate any and every request. Oh and we got free dessert for our anniversary as well! Our waiter Carlo was fantastic. If you are thinking of trying this place but are unsure, GO GO GO!!!!",

I went to Vegas recently with a group of gfs and we stopped in for late lunch and drinks.    First off, we had Robert as a waiter and he was great!  Everyone was so nice and we had so much fun dining here.  The girls and I ordered a few plates and shared the following:  Apps -*Spicy Tuna Tartare, Avocado, Pickled Ginger, Cucumber, Crisp Sesame Wontons -Crispy Fried Calamari, Cucumber Slaw, Lemon, Gremolata Aioli  Entrees -Linguini, Manila Clams, Garlic, Pancetta, Fresh Chili, Wild Oregano -*Steamed Black Mussels, Chorizo, White Wine, Garlic, Grilled Sourdough, Fries, Smoked Paprika Bearnaise  Dessert -Chocolate Beignets  I believe we had another app but it was something basic and has been taken off their menu.    It was delicious!  Everything!  We all agreed our favorite dish was their Linguini and it was so good that we grabbed it for dinner the next night!  Everything was flavored and cooked well.  We were disappointed with anything.  We were already full and weren't planning to get dessert but the table next to us ordered the beignets and we had to get it.  If you've never had it, it is basically a french version of a munchkin except they had melted chocolate inside each.   So if you can only order one of each, go with the tartare and the linguini.  You won't be disappointed!!",

    "text": "Was in Vegas this weekend with friends for a birthday celebration and we decided Sunday to have lunch at Wolfgang Pucks restaurant at MGM. I'd never eaten at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant so I was excited to try it out.  Sad to say I'll probably never eat at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant again.  We all enjoyed our food, but the service was HORRIBLE.   It started with our waiter basically throwing the drink menu on the table. When he came back, the first thing he said was \"do you have any questions?\"  How about your name?  Luckily we were ready to order so he took it and then we waited, and waited, and waited. It took almost an hour from when we sat down till we received our food.  The tables around us all got their food before us, even tables that sat down after us.  One table sat down after us, ordered, ate AND paid before we got our food.  At one point the waiter came by and my friend asked him where our food was and he said it would be right out.  I was getting ready to go find the manager to ask about our food when the manager came to us.  He said our food was being plated as he spoke, but it still took another 5 minutes for it to arrive.    After the manager talked to us, our waiter barely came by our table; he wouldn't even make eye contact when he walked by.  He did manage to clear my drink glass, but didn't bother to ask me if I wanted another one.  After the wait we'd had, I would have taken a second drink, but I guess he didn't want us to linger.    It was also disappointing that the manager didn't bother to compensate us for the long wait and crappy service.  We're not sure why the manager came to us, but clearly he knew something was wrong. How about trying to make it right?  If he had, I probably wouldn't be writing this review.",

    "text": "Mmmm, every bite I ate was better than the last.  I thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal.  I ordered the Maytag Bleu cheese chips for an appetizer and fully plan to go back for another one of these before I go home - so yummy.  They were simple - homemade potato chips with bleu cheese sauce topping them, but they were the favorite appetizer among the group I was with.  For dinner, I had the special - an 8oz filet, crusted with blue crab and served with some kind of spiced bearnaise sauce (I forget what the spice was).  On the side, I opted for the crispy Tuscan potatoes.   Everything was really delicious.  The steak was cooked just a little rare for my taste (I ordered medium), but I have come to expect this with filet as it's so thick.  The bearnaise, oh the bearnaise.  I could have ordered a bowl full of it.  The crab crust on top was also very tasty.  The bearnaise and crab elevated the steak, and the combination was perfect.  I highly recommend the Tuscan potatoes.  They are simple - red skinned potatoes, sliced and tossed with olive oil, salt and some herbs, then flash fried.  They were great.  I was almost talked into the fries, as they are supposed to be excellent. I had the opportunity to try some from one of my tablemates, and they were good, but fries are fries.  So glad I went with the potatoes instead.    Now, the ambiance...  It is nicely decorated and our server was very good.  He gave us excellent advice and recommendations.  It is very LOUD, however.  The restaurant has a patio effect, and is open to the casino, passerby, etc.  They have music playing on top of all of that exterior noise, and in order for it to be heard, the music has to be quite loud.  When our server was on the other side of the table explaining the specials, I couldn't hear a word he said.  I was with a group of seven, and I had no hope of hearing those at the other end of the table.  By the time we left, my voice was scratchy as if I had been to a concert.  In summary - food was absolutely fantastic.  I'm going back for lunch just to eat it again.  But don't go if you're looking for a quiet, peaceful or romantic dinner.",

It was just what the doctor ordered for a nice lunch in a chaotic casino.   There were so many good looking sandwiches on this menu, we had a hard time deciding on one to try, but settled on the pork belly BLT and split the special tomato soup. Both were great, but man oh man, that BLT was to DIE for. It was so simple, but each part was done so well it blew us away. A must get for sure! The tomato soup was good too, made a bit too acidic for me, but still good. The cheese sandwich that came with it had goat cheese, which I love and it was great for dipping.   The service here was great and next time I'm in Vegas I look forward to coming here for dinner, as I see based on the yelp reviews that is fabulous as well.",

After winding my way through the casino I finally found my destination and took a seat at the bar. Freddie (I'm assuming he's a manager) and I chatted for a bit while I perused the menu. I decided on a Elderflower martini to start and was incredibly pleased with my choice. This drink was literally perfect and I would've had another but as I said...this was a work trip =) Next came the Maytag bleu cheese chips, hello delicious! I only ate the chips saturated with topping because I knew my entree was on its way...but hello, this dish is sinful and pure yum.  My main course was perfectly cooked, piping hot white fish with tomatoes, spinach and a creamy slightly sweet corn based sauce. It was really simple but oh so good-I'm very glad Freddie recommended it! Finally I had a sweet sorbet that cleansed my palate just so...after thanking the staff for their time and wonderful hospitality I walked er rolled back to Mandalay Bay.

I still can visualize it clearly--- an obnoxious, bright orange rose-patterned wall that made my head spin not only because I was hungover but really because it made a pretty \"loud\" statement. Decor is nice and modern, and it is a pretty casual restaurant. No dress code---(I've been there, walking from restaurant to restaurant because each kept rejecting the guys' outfits) so you don't have to worry about being underdressed. DO dress casual, DON'T dress up. Casual does not mean they're not professional! They provide good service. To be entirely honest, when we were there our server was busy tending to her larger parties. While I acknowledge that yes, larger parties do require more attention, we felt like we did not get as good as a service from her than the other table. However, the bussers and food runners did make sure we were taken care of, so the experience was  good nevertheless. Since it was a light lunch, we got three things but it was more than enough. The wings and the skewers were amazing, I would definitely go back to get them again. We also got the salmon entree, but that one was just okay. It was good, but noting memorable.",

They even pulled our chairs out- something that doesn't happen everyday.   Let me start by saying that the truffle potato chips were the best thing I've ever eaten in my life and I would travel back to vegas JUST for them. Anything made with truffle oil literally makes my tummy rumble with hunger when I think of it, and this topped EVERYTHING. So much flavour and deliciousness in one dish. It was like kettle chips on steroids. SOOOOO GOOD. I also had the salad (which I can't remember the name of) but it was the 'asian' one? with wonton crisps and candied cashews. I remember this salad used cabbage.. which I hate.. so when it came, I was like 'shit.' but then it tasted SO GOOD. Wow, I am seriously mindblown. What kind of chef runs this place? Excuse me for drooling all over your restaurant. Boyfriend ordered the prosciutto pizza and it made his stomach happy. I personally didn't try any since I've had pizza 2 days in a row and got sick of it already.. oops. Also, there was a guy who always made sure our water was full. Dehydration is common out in vegas but definitely not in this place, where they make sure after every few sips, YOU NEED MORE WATER.  The service was phenomenal and y'know.. us canadians.. we're used to tipping 10% where we're from (because min wage is higher), so the usual norm of tipping 20%+ was strange and uncomfortable to us since we've entered the US. However, this place DEFINITELY earned their tip and we were happy to leave a great tip for amazing servers.",

Fries were just regular skinny cut fries. Nothing special. I finished my burger because it was so good.   My girlfriend got the linguini with garlic sauce, pancetta, and steamed clams.

I tried the world renowned blue cheese chips and in my view the salt in there was so overpowering that it did make it a bit unpleasant to get down and it didn't help either that they lost heat pretty quick. I did like the water if that counts?  Entree wise since it was lunch I went with a pizza and although I don't remember what I had exactly I do remember the taste and alas it tasted just like the name: a puck. Well maybe not that far, but it by no means has me coming back for more at all.",

The gluten free pizza was surprisingly good - difference between this and what you might get somewhere else was the pizza dough, which seemed homemade (as opposed to the mealy cardboard one might come to expect).  The only reason I wouldn't give Wolfgang's a fifth star was because the service was so slow.  We were eating between lunch and dinner, so I was confused why everything was taking so long.  Make sure to order your next drink when you have about half left.  This restaurant seems to have better hours than most of the restaurants at MGM.",

Our Meal: $153.64  Appetizer: Sauteed Maryland Crab Cakes w/ Basil Pesto Aioli & Tomato Relish $18.00  Salad: Chinois Chicken Salad, Candied Cashews, Crisp Wontons, Chinese Mustard Vinaigrette $16.00  Entrees: BF- (1) Mesquite Grilled Ribeye, Tuscan Potatoes, Sauteed Morels, English Peas, Red Wine Jus $48.00 Me-(2) Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak, Blue Cheese Butter, Red Wine Sauce, Fries $37.00 Dessert: Warm Chocolate Brownie w/ Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - $12.00 (comped)   APPETIZER: Crab cakes were the size of a half dollar (being generous) with four on the plate. Unfortunately they left no real memory other than small and not fabulous. A 5 out of 10.   SALAD: They split the salad in two with both HUGE portions. It was delicious with an even amount of tasty ingredients to make you fall in love with it. This was a winner, a 10 out of 10.   ENTREES: Our entrees took 30 - 40 minutes or longer. They said it was because the ribeye was ordered 'well done'. (Other restaurants have no problem cooking well done in a timely manner.) My bf loved his ribeye and all the accoutrements that came with it. He would give it an 8.5 - 9 out of 10 (just an FYI, he loves ALL food). Flat iron steak was rare and flavorful but a bit tough with grit, that happens with these steaks sometimes. I didn't finish the skinny fries as they weren't 'amazing' but they were fresh, crispy and 'fun' for a minute. I would have preferred mashed or baked. Fries seem to make the plate weak especially at $37.00. A 7 out of 10.   DESSERT: The desert was 10 out of 10- a \"Warm Chocolate Melting Brownie with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream\". They dont 'do' bday's there meaning they dont sing and embarrass you but they did make a beautiful plate with kind wishes. The dessert was comped which was very nice, especially at $12.00.   Overall if in Vegas again I would go back but for the salad mostly.",

I had Gnocchi ricotta pasta with tomato sauce. It was delicious. The sauce was especially good. My vegan wife got a salad that they made special for her with lots of veggies and no high calorie dressing. They were very accommodating of her dietary needs. She said it was \"yummy\".   The food came quite quickly. This is the type of place that you can have a sit down meal for 2 hours, or order quickly and be be done in 30-40 minutes.  Prices are average for the Las Vegas strip, high for other places but on par for this area. So I can't complain.  My only knock was the pre-dinner bread. It wasn't bad, but completely average. But, it was free and you shouldn't fill up on bread before a tasty meal.   I would definitely go back again. In fact my wife asked that we come back again tomorrow.",

Ordered the Margherita pizza and woo howdy was it amazing. The dough was crispy and soft, the sauce wasn't too much and did not overpower the cheese along with the basil. It was a simple pizza but a well balanced one at that.  Also the ribeye steak looked and smelled delicious and I'm awaiting to return back and order that for dinner.  I'll probably just end up doing that tomorrow.",

I have to admit, I was a bit worried about how the food, ambiance and service would be, considering the celebrity chef name, but I was not diappointed.    I love the layout of the restaurant.  First, it is located close to the KA theater, so is really convenient for a pre or post show bite to eat.  The restaurant itself also has really nice decor and is open to the casino, but is not loud or smoky.  There is a bar when you first enter, and you can order food there as well.  The menu is pretty diverse.  I love the burger, the wood fired pizzas, the chinese chicken salad, the apple salad.  Most of all I LOVE the truffled potato chips.  I pray that they NEVER remove these from the menu.  They are so damn delicious.  The chips are fresh and covered in blue cheese and truffle oil and just amazing.  The restaurant has a decent beer and wine selection and the staff is always friendly and knowledgable as well.  The other great thing is that they are open LATE.  They have a graveyard menu and close at 6am, then reopen at 11am for lunch.  If you are out late partying and are staying at the MGM or nearby and need some decent non-food court grub, hit up Wolfgang Puck's!",

We countered this by ordering from the appetizer menu, and sharing a bunch of different options.   I feel like calling this place a Bar and Grill is a tad misleading. The overall ambiance is too fancy, and the prices on the menu are too high.   We tried: - Steak skewers -- cooked perfectly to medium, which was a pleasant surprise!  - Chicken wings -- WOW! What flavor! Tasty, tangy, yum! - Brussels sprouts with confit bacon -- delightful. The sprouts were cooked until tender and caramelized.  - Crab cakes -- tasted fresh. Plenty of crab meat!   Other members of our party ordered the Cobb salad, the calamari, and the truffle chips. Though I did not personally try these dishes, I heard that they were all solid.   Props to the server who made a mistake on our order, but rectified the situation without missing a beat.   If I'm ever in the MGM again, I would return. However, I would not go out of my way to come back. This place is just a bit too expensive for my idea of a regular restaurant choice.",

And though we only had water to drink the staff made sure our glasses were kept full. From the hostess seating us until the time we left everyone was very attentive and we appreciate their efforts. We really had a wonderful experience. It's these kinds of experiences that keep us coming back. Stay strong Las Vegas!",

The blue cheese chips were good but the tuna tartar on the other hand that was a different story. As soon as it came out I could tell it wasn't fresh. The color of the tuna was dark almost with a purple tint. So i gave the benefit of the doubt and tried a bite, It tasted so fishy and rancid I spit it out. I won't be back for a while",

This is the very place I tried Tuna Tare Tare and fell in love with it! and hands down the best compared to other one's I have tried here in Vancouver and *NOTE Hawaii Wolf Gang Puck Tuna Tare Tare is not the same at all!!!  Everytime I go to Vegas it's a must!  *NOTE! For an Appetizer its pricey for this Tuna Tare Tare ($20) but definitely worth it!",

Didn't really like the gravy or whatever it's called that comes with it soy suave based-ish. But nice garnish because no alt or pepper provided !",

When we walked up there wasnt a line so were able to get a seat asap. Our waitress was very nice..not hella attentive but nice. I ordered the crab cakes which were to die for!!!! They were moist and kinda of crispy . Those were the best crab cakes I've tasted....well actually that was the 2nd time I tried em in life so maybe that's why lol. My friends had the Mesquite Steak Skewers and a ham and turkey club or somethng. Everything looked and tasted good!   Downside and why they only got 4 stars: HELLA EXPENSIVE! My crab cakes were 17 dollars and my drink was 12 ( I got the Bellini) and even though everything was delicious, my crab cakes were the size of hush puppies! and I only got 4!!! I understand its a appetizer but if I would had known they were going to be that small, I woulda gotten something a lil more filling. I know its Vegas and everything is way to much that's why I didn't trip that hard, I just wish I gotten more food..even a  lil salad on the side of something lol!  But overall, service was good, food was great! I'd definitely come back again and get a app and a entree.",

The first course was a chopped vegetable salad, and for the entree our guests had the choice of the chicken or steak.  Our guests are still telling me how delicious everything was.  We got our cake through them also for a very low fee and it was divine (2 layers, one was chocolate genoise/tiramisu, the other was white sponge/white chocolate mousse with berries).    Our host was wonderful and attentive--I met him the day before when I dropped off the cake server, champagne glasses, cake toppers, and placecards.  We chatted for about 20 minutes the day before about why we had chosen Vegas to get married and that sort of thing--on the day of, he was super sweet and he made sure everyone was taken care of completely.  Our party was in the small private room, with the wine cabinet against one wall, and it was very nice.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars was due to a mixup with how the cake was to be paid (I'd faxed the info in about 6 weeks prior and I have no idea what happened to it).  They were less responsive over email than I would have preferred but it all worked out in the end.  It was better than I could have imagined.",

My bf ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and it was $25, so he thought this was going to be the best plate of spaghetti and meatballs that he ever had.

The prices are reasonable and it is situated on the floor of the MGM casino so there is always plenty to see. They have a honey lemonade that makes for a great cocktail when ordered with grey goose.  Pros: Food, price, beverages  Cons: Since it is on the casino floor, it lacks intimacy.",

    "text": "Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill is inside of Crystals mall in CityCenter.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of the mall and is really easy to find.  It's located next to other restaurants in Crystals such as Social House and Mastro's.  It's open restaurant seating gives it the feeling of a food court type establishment.  But obviously much more upscale to align with the Wolfgang Puck branding.  I admit, I've heard great things about it before from other friends.  I'm also a big fan of Italian food so I was anxious to try it.  So we came here late on a weekday night.  There was no wait and the restaurant was light.  We decided to sit at the bar as there was happy hour bar menu.  I'm not sure if that was a good choice.  While the service here is great, the prices for what you get in food and atmosphere were not.  Now don't get me wrong.  The food isn't bad, but I expected more given the reputation and prices.   The food itself is tasty.  They seem to keep their approach on food very simple... which I prefer.  But overall, I think that there are better alternatives for the prices.  ie. Trattoria Reggiano at the Venetian  To mention, we had: -  Roasted Cauliflower -  Wild Mushrooms Porchini -  Steamed Spinach -  Spaghetti and Meatballs -  Asparagas Salad with Panna Cotta and Prosciutto  I'm sorry Wolfgang, but I'm not a fan.",

We stopped for an aftershow dinner following the 19:30 Ka show.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs with a side of grilled asparagus and it was great ... lots of food, comfort food at that, and nothing to be disappointed about.  Admittedly nothing spectacular, but overall filling, pleasing and hit-the-spot tasty.  I also recommend the chicken wings, sweet glaze with a nice chili burn.   My companions had the chopped vegetable salad (looked great), a simply fantastic looking Cabrese salad with a startling assortment of heirloom tomatoes and a brace of thin crust pizzas that smelled terrific.  Everyone in my party were pleased with both the food and the service.",

    "text": "This will sound strange but since my poor experience with a certain famous chef's restaurant in NOLA (I won't say who just that he says \"BAM\" a lot) I have been dying to find another chef that has the same status or popularity and prove that not all celeb chef's build a restaurant and then just leave it to others to run (sorry Mr. Bam but I was deeply upset by the food). So Mr. Wolfgang Puck was put to the test and he passed with flying colors!!   The Puck man owners just a few (I believe he has 6) restaurants in Vegas, we decided on Puck's Bar & Grill located at the MGM Grand. I'm going to start off by saying how HOT the staff is!! They were really sweet too, extremely helpful and had the timing of the food/drinks down to a science. The decor has an elegant yet modern-bold style to it, a lot of white and glass, plus it is open so you can watch everyone walk by from the casino.   The menu has this rustic (hence Grill in the Bar & Grill vibe) beach front bistro feel to it. Beautifully cooked and nothing short of fresh ingredients, each bite was just what was needed to satisfy the taste buds. Calamari was excellent, Spicy Tuna Tartare was mind blowing, best tomato salad I've ever had, and a tomato pizza (which I have to say at first I was like pizza really) but it ended up absolutely an excellent way to combine all the ingredients of the night.   So what really separated the two chefs are two very important things to a diner. Flavor and price, Puck hit the flavor perfectly and what he didn't do is sacrifice your wallet to get those flavors unlike Mr. Bam. The portion sizes were just right too, unlike Mr. Bam. I can't say that I have given up on the Bam but he needs to take a few notes from Wolfgang.",

    "text": "I'm not saying anything original to observe that Wolfgang Puck has over-extended his brand.  Anything Puck-related, thank I've experienced, suffers from the same problem.  It isn't hard to stumble on to something excellent, but there isn't a level of care that ensures excellence at every turn.  You also get the added problem of the snobbishness of a fine restaurant coupled with the incompetence of a chain.  I'm not sure if I ever had great bread at a Wolfgang place, it seems that they'd rather do something \"interesting\" rather than delicious.  It's the sort of bread that was popular in the 80s, and it's a habit worth breaking.  The waiters, as far as I can tell, do not write orders down.  When this happens, the body language of the waiter lets you know if he got the order in his head.  This time, his clueless expression led to our being unsurprised when a soup went missing.  He returned well into the meal, long after soup time. We also ordered a cured meat platter with toast and burrata, although completely delicious, was served without explanation of the types of meat.    Keeping with policy, I won't comment on other's dishes unless I have a taste, so despite other's disappointment, my veal ravioli with brown butter, mushroom and sage was amazing - and the portions were far more than I could handle.   In all, an uneven and overpriced experience, but it's a nice, casual meal when one of the stuffier nearby eateries won't work.",

Next time I might skip the cheese burger and just drink the martini's with the souffle.

The second time, we had the Chinouis salad which is Wolfgangs famous chinese chicken salad and it was delicous. His pizza was eh.   The service was good the first time and terrible the second time.

Because I thought the food lacked so much, I am going to make this a short review, because it doesn't even deserve that much time from me!  My mother ordered the pizza. Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Unos, etc. have it one-up, hands-down on this places monstrous version of pizza. To give you an idea of how bad it was, my mother sent it back and the table next to us to one bite of theirs and were too shy to say anything about it.  I ordered the Chicken Milanese with Spinach greens. The salad was good, the chicken came out of a box...or that was at least what I could easily assume about the paper thin, overly crusted, tasteless thing called chicken. In addition to my meal, my excitement led me to order a side of pureed potatoes. Ummm....WTF did they serve me? No taste, no seasoning, no....nothing. White sloppy mush!  Grandma had that delish looking beef on sticks. Not too much of a complaint there, but specify how you want your meat. Each stick of meat had a varying degree of \"done-ness\" ranging from charcoal burnt to red and bloody. Not sure what the intent of that was.   Overall, not again. Where is Denny's?",

I'm not sure if it's supposed to be that way, but I prefer my bread to be warm.  Shrimp scampi: I'd never thought I'd say this but the noodles were too tough. I love my pasta al dente but this was a couple minutes before al dente. The dish was really flavorful and there was a good amount of big shrimp, but it was way too salty. They are pretty heavy handed with the salt here.. I had to drink a lot of water with my dinner.  Mushroom ravioli: it looked like a small amount at first, but the ravioli was pretty filling. Once again, the flavor was pretty good, but it was pretty salty. I really liked all the parsley they put on the dish. Mushroom pizza: pretty good but I didn't try enough to really have an opinion.

This one located in the MGM just across from the KA Ticket office is excellent.  Delicious and hearty American fare at reasonable prices (for the generous portions). We got the burger, pork belly sandwich, and a side of mac and cheese - for two people, we were stuffed and ended up bringing half of our dinner home for late night! The sandwiches were $17 each (but both had huge sides of fries or Greek macaroni salad) and the Mac n Cheese was $12.   Service was top notch and continuously attentive. The ambiance is casual but still contemporary inside with an open-faced layout facing the casino outward. Great for dates, small groups, large groups, or just to get a bite to eat any time of the day. They are open daily until 5AM!",

The menu has though - they removed a few of my favorite items, while raising the prices of others. However we still go here regularly because we know we are going to get a great meal in a fun atmosphere - there are no walls, so you are literally in the middle of the casino, so its great for people watching.",

She said the food was good but the waiter (Albert) was the most inattentive server she has ever had. After he took their order, he never came back to check if the needed drinks or anything like that.. the next time they saw him was when he dropped off the check.. they ended up not tipping Albert but making sure to personally tip the buser (Brandon). Not trying to speak negatively on the restaurant, overall their experience wasn't bad. Just didn't like his service",

When I came with my boyfriend, their oven was broken so after we spent time looking at the menu and deciding on pizza, we had to go back to the drawing board. That basically eliminated a third of the menu. We decided almost immediately that we wanted to skip to dessert but had to wait a while for the waitor to come back just to give us a dessert menu. Then my boyfriend wanted the chocolate souffle but they were also out of that. The Creme brulee was decent but not amazing and the ice cream sandwich was very good and creative. Also the cherry sunrise is a nice and tasty drink! Unfortunately we had to wait a while to get the check and then for the waitor to pick up the check as well. The bus boy was very attentive! We always had water in our glass.",

    "text": "Use ur M life points here!  We stumbled here the first day for lunch because were gambling and needed a break from all the losses. After finding out we could use our M life rewards here, we came back again the next day!  This originally wasn't on my list of places to eat, but being near the casino floor we decided to stop in for what we thought would be a mediocre but quick lunch. The waiter came by and gave us the normal spiel of what were the specials for the day, which I honestly never pay attention to. However, my boyfriend does, and he noticed that their special, NOT ON THEIR MENU, was a salmon burger with corn based slaw onions etc.   FOOD we ordered from both visits: SALMON BURGER - omg. AMAZING. this is OFF THE MENU so if you're coming here and you love salmon as much as i do and love corn as much as i do, make sure you ask for this. I've had salmon burgers elsewhere that i thought were great, but this is amazing!! I'm so glad that our waiter came by and mentioned that it was off the menu. If i weren't coming back to try the other recommended items from yelpers the second day, i would've ordered it again.   TRUFFLED POTATO CHIPS with MAYTAG BLUE CHEESE - ordered this per yelper's recommendations. SO YUMS!!! the potato chips were not thin but not super thick, made just the right width with the right crunchiness. I love truffle oil and I love it when its used right. You could definitely taste the truffle oil on the chips. It's not overpowering. I'm also generally not a big fan of blue cheese on anything else but my salads, but there wasn't enough. Plus you can always brush it off when you're eating the potato chip, it doesn't leave a residue taste on the chip either.  CRAB CAKES - ordered this per yelpers recommendations as well. they come out in 4 or 5 what looks like tiny crab cakes, but they are made exquisitely and I have to say even being located in desert nevada, these crab cakes were fresh and delicious! I hate it when people put in so many crumbs it takes away from the crab stuffing or the crab flavour. That wasn't the case at all. It wasn't an overpowering crab taste either. I highly recommend ordering these!   REUBEN SANDWICH - My boyfriend ordered this. I'm not a huge fan of Reuben's but he said it was ok. He asked for no cheese on his reuben, but it came out with cheese anyway. The one good thing about this was he asked for a substitute of a salad for his french fries, and the salad that came out was fresh and delicious!  SPICY TUNA TARTARE - this was a good order. I tried a few other tuna tartare's that week in vegas and this was definitely the best one that I tried. I liked the wonton's that came with it too. the chip was thick and crunchy.   BBQ PORK SPARE RIBS - Ordered this bc we had M life points to spend (WUT WUT in the MGM). They were made well, but being from the south I've definitely tasted better ribs. but since these were comped ribs, I have no complaints. hahaha.  SPICY SOPRESSATA PIZZA - my boyfriend ordered this as well. I'm not a fan of spicy things on my pizza but he was A BIG FAN OF THIS PIZZA. He highly highly recommends it.   Didn't have room during either visit for dessert but nothing on the menu super caught my eye.   ATMOSPHERE/DECOR: i loved the decor! it was spacious and light, with enough ambiance to create a non-casino feel. It had an open view of the casino games around us, but also enough baracades (these round wooden bigger than life wreath type things) to close you in on your eating and dining experience. It does get a lil loud but not loud enough for you to yell to your eating mates.   SERVICE - service was great. The waiters were always attentive but not hovering, and they always made sure that we had water in our cups (which we needed since we came in the middle of scorching hot 120 degree July). I also liked that they sent things out as they were ready, not \"when they're supposed to come out.\" Really liked that about the place.   I love this place. It's incredibly REASONABLY PRICED, even if you don't use your comp points here. I loved the casualness yet classy feel of the place. Definitely HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you're in the area, or if you just wanna stop by for a quick lunch. Its a good break from all the smoking as well. Huge props to wolfgang and chef Scott Irestone for the amazing work they did here!",

Although it was late there was a wait list for seating (4th July does tend to get pretty packed) but we were seated within five minutes and had drinks almost immediately after sitting down. The menu is extensive and all of the meals sound delicious! I had the grilled Salmon and my boyfriend had the meatballs and we were definitely not disappointed- absolutely delicious. Another high point of our experience was the attentiveness and overall awesome of the servers, very knowledgeable, friendly and prompt.  It was such a fantastic experience and I definitely recommend Wolfgang Puck to everyone who likes excellent food and great service!",

Well it's been over 30 minutes now and i was just told it'll be another 10 minutes.. awesome. Fries came out cold, the burger was delicious. All i have to say is i was the only person sitting at the bar at the moment and i saw 3 people get carry-out orders before my Order ever came out was disappointing. Hopefully something gets done about it. I will update.",

Wolfgang's service and food have been consistently good, which seems to keep some regular customers over the weekend.   The bar is a one of the best seats in the house! The bartenders are always on top of everything where my water was always filled and the dishes were always ready to be peppered; top notch! Wolfgang is a nice restaurant, but still casual enough where they have items priced from $15-30 (including pizza, sandwich, pasta, fish, and burgers).   -Dishes-  Linguine Pancetta with steamed clams: My go to dish at Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill! I always order this dish when I drop by Vegas. It's flavorful and the balance between the clams and Pancetta makes this dish buttery good.   Cesar Salad: Visually pleasing and tasty with the right amount of dressing.. One of the best Cesar Salad I have ordered, nom!  Burger and Fries: Burger layered to perfections; juicy meat with fresh buns! The fries are 'to die' for as well; no stale fries!  Tortellini Short Rib with Squash Puruee: This dish is a balance of the sweetness from the squash and heavier sauce versus the Short Ribs. It's great! This dish is a slightly lighter than other, which is a great option for a smaller stomach.   Overall, great food with chic decor inside MGM!",

I initially saw that they had the Fettuccine Alfredo, perhaps on an old menu however when I arrived I asked my waiter why I no longer saw it and he says that they often change the menu to add variety.  He was such a doll and had the kitchen make me a special plate of the fettuccine with any additional items that I wanted to add like chicken and mushroom.  We started with the Maryland Blue Crab Cakes, Basil Pesto Aioli, Tomato Relish.  For dinner my colleges had the House Made Ricotta Gnocchi-Fennel Sausage Bolognese, Parmesan, Italian Parsley, Braised Beef Short Rib-Crisp Spaetzle, Horseradish Creme Fraiche , and the Linguine-Steamed Manila Clams, White Wine-Garlic Sauce, Tuscan Olive Oil.  Everyone was satisfied with their meal, the Fettuccine didn't knock my socks off it was pretty average much like the picture I took of it below.  For a starter you HAVE to order the Truffled Potato Chips, Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce...one word...HEAVEN!!!",

It was a fairly small serving though, so in hindsight I'd recommend each getting your own entree here.. which is what most people do anyway.  For dinner, we had an amazing Thanksgiving feast. Don't tell my family, but it was the very best Thanksgiving meal I've ever had. It was three courses, starting with a Beet & Burrata salad and ending with a pumpkin pie fancy type dessert.  For the entree, there was turkey (white breast meat), an amazing shredded dark meat (I usually hate dark meat!), sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, and stuffing. It was $49 at lunch for this menu, and $55 at dinner time. My husband and I most definitely shared this and we left waddling. There is no way one person should ever consume that quantity of food.  We also had two hefeweizens. The one on draft was very good, but the one in the bottle didn't even resemble a hefe style beer.  Definitely make time for this place!",

The guy was on his game and handled things I've seen a whole crew couldn't do. The guy was on , serving customers, dishing out plates, cleaning areas, greeting people, and not skipping on doing a great job on the drinks. Props to the person that hired him and a major kudos to Donte!",

On our last night here we ate at Wolfgang Pucks and to our surprise this was the most amazing experience we had eating out. Our waiter Daren was the most friendly, polite and professional  waiter that I have had the experience  in dealing with. The food was excellent, the recommendations from the  staff was right on point.  I travel a lot for work and have never experienced  the attention to detail as I did during my visit to Wolfgang Pucks Las Vegas restaurant.   If you are ever in Las Vegas do yourself a favor. Stop by Wolfgang Pucks  for not only and amazing meal but also an amazing  attention to detail from Daren, Andrew and the manager John.  I highly recommend  this  establishment. You will not be disappointed.",

My experience wasn't bad by any means, but after having been to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR restaurant the night before, this place fell short of my expectations.   I got their linguini with shrimp, which was good, but for the restaurant I was in and the price I was paying, I would have wanted something that blew me away. This dish did not. My friend got their fish with a side of pasta, and her fish was a little on the dry side. We had to ask for bread a couple of times--it wasn't automatically brought to our table. The ambience of the restaurant was ok--a little too floral for my taste but you could tell it was an upscale place.  I did like our waiter--he was friendly and helped to customize my friend's order so that she got the pasta on the side instead of the veggies, and he didn't charge her extra.   I would say there are too many other restaurants to try in Vegas, you wouldn't be missing out on anything passing over this place.",

    "text": "Came here with my friend for a late lunch, and we had a wonderful time! We shared two dishes, as we were planning to eat later on with our other two friends. In short, the two dishes we ordered are a must!!  Truffle Potato Chips with Blue Cheese Sauce - both of us were not a fan of blue cheese (but a huge fan of truffle!!!), so we asked to have the sauce on the side. When it arrived, there is a huge bowl of truffle cheese sauce goodness, and a small side of crumbled blue cheese, which we just ignored and was respectively offered to taken away by the sweet waiters. What a delicious appetizer it was! That sauce is absolutely DIVINE - you can really taste the truffle and it being paired up with cheesy scrumptiousness is like pairing peanut butter and jelly; it just goes perfectly well. (If there was blue cheese in that cheese sauce, we didn't taste it!) If you don't care for the crumbled blue cheese, we really do recommend asking for the sauce on the side! Having to dip each house made crispy chip into the sauce made it a little fun, and we didn't have to deal with any soggy chips or sauce being unevenly dispersed.   Salmon with Herb Marinated Couscous, Lemon Creme Fraiche, and Parsley Pesto - We saw the table next to us order this, and it looked delicious! When asking which dish on the menu was it, she told us it was the salmon and that it really is delicious as it looks. Per recommendation, we ordered it! The waitress asked how we would like the salmon cooked, and medium rare is what we picked. The salmon came out cooked to perfection; pink in the inside, flakey, moist, and bursting with flavor with the help of parsley pesto on the top. This paired with the tasty couscous with a light creamy lemon flavor of the lemon creme fraiche was a wonderful combination. The couscous also had bits of pine nuts and golden raisins, which gave great texture and little sweetness to the dish. The dish was garnished with basil, which is always a plus because basil + pesto + salmon is like the tasty trio!   We finished everything and left completely full! Service was nothing short of amazing and accommodating - with smiles, plate changes, water cup constantly filled, etc. I only wished our other two friends were with us so they could experience a yummy meal....... also so we could have ordered more and tried out other dishes heh heh.",

    "text": "I never thought twice about eating here until friends came to town and someone in the group suggested dining here. Since I'm in a money-saving mode right now dining at this mid-level spot sounded like a good idea for eating on the Strip. The atmosphere is lacking as the restaurant is completely open to the MGM Grand casino making it impossible to ignore the ringing and buzzing from slot machines or the buzzed clientele of the hotel, clubs, and dayclubs. Fortunately, the food made up for all of that.  Corn chowder soup ($12) - lots of corn kernels and bits of bacon in a velvety smooth soup. Great flavor.  Butter lettuce Caesar salad ($13) - portions are big so you may want to share. Like a True Caesar they put anchovies on it.  Spicy tuna tartare ($21) - not bad. A little on the sweet side with its use of soy sauce for its Asian influence. The flavors were ok and I liked the sesame crackers.  Lasagna ($21) - who knew you could find good lasagna in a restaurant owned by an Austrian that serves a fusion of multiple cuisines? It was a perfect combination of savoriness with the sausage bolognese and sweetness from the cheese and bechamel.  Cheese and basil pesto ravioli ($21) - I didn't try it but the person who ordered it had to send it back because it wasn't cooked all the way.  Ricotta gnocchi ($23) - dense but still tasty.  Steamed black mussels ($25) - another dish that was huge. Good enough for two to share. Plenty of plump, juicy mussels in a savory sauce.  Chicken fingers ($6.95) - always a crowd pleaser for kids. The portion size was large enough for 3 kids to share but we only have one. There were plenty of leftovers for the next two nights.  The food here is simple, as they cater to price conscious tourists who aren't adventurous eaters, but it's executed well. The menu is all over the place with Asian, Italian, and American dishes so chances are you and everyone in your party will find something to eat. It's not a destination restaurant, but certainly a good option for those staying nearby or those looking for a reasonably priced meal on the Strip.  3.5 Stars",

We ordered burgers and the blue cheese potato chips, beware that these are addicting, rich and filling.  We only ate at the bar so I can't really speak to the waitstaff but the bartenders were great, I never had an empty water glass and as I was getting low on my ordered drink they were quick to ask if I wanted another.

How do we know? We saw a man in the motorized scooter drive up into the restaurant, park, get off, and walk to his table.   Other than that, the table where we were seated was in full view of the flat screen TV which was showing the nude version of \"The Bride of Frankenstein\". It was a pretty old movie and the station that aired it had no problem blurring out the boobs etc.   Oh, back to my food. The chicken soup was superb. Chock full of chicken, carrots, celery, and potato, the broth was so clear and fresh tasting.  I could have and should have made a lunch out of the soup and roll. The wild mushroom ravioli in parm cream sauce was delicious. And filling. And mushroomy. OMG there was an over-abundance of a plethora of 'shrooms. Enoki, portobella, oyster, button, you name it and it was both in the sauce whole and minced inside the ravioli. I could not eat all of those mushrooms. I had to leave half of them on my plate. I washed it all down with a really great glass of pinot grigio. Fantastic lunch.   The space is open and airy. In spite of the fact that slots and blackjack tables are on two sides of the restaurant, its not smoky at all. The decor is all white \"laquer\" with blond wood and red accents.   The restaurant is visually appealing and the food is delicious. I'd go back. I'm a fan!",

Truffle fries were highly recommended and delicious, although the blue cheese almost competes with the truffle oil flavor. We ordered the capellini with shrimp  and the mussels. Both were very good although the mussels dish was huge. It probably had 40-50 mussels in it. Everything was pretty reasonably priced for what you got as well. I will definitely come back here if I'm at the MGM again.",

They are made fresh to order with this blue cheese cream smothered all over the chips, and they are to die for.  Whether I'm dying for the appetizer or just passing by, I have to get my blue chip fix at Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill.  This is a great restaurant that's open to the casino floor and very comfortable.  They have a way of making the space feel private despite it's open floor layout.  Service is great and the food is great!  I love the menu choices.  All the food feels clean and not heavy on the stomach.  That, and his flavor combinations are really nice.  There are some things that you'll find just average, like most hotel eateries, but if I had to choose one thing that stands out here, it's the damn blue cheese chips.    Grab a seat and have the chips with a glass of wine or a beer.  It's good and worth the stop.  Sure, other restaurants try to make it, but only Wolfgang's makes it right.",

I called the place and had no trouble at all getting a reservation for 7 people at the time I wanted.  This place is in a high traffic part of the casino so it's also really loud, which was intensified by an obvious bachelorette party seated next to us, lol.   The service was less than stellar and I had to ask for bread 3 times, when it seemed to constantly be coming out to all the other tables automatically. Three of us at the table ordered this fancy-sounding Pink Lady Apple & D'Anjou Pear Salad. The presentation was nice and it tasted pretty good. Not the cheapest food but not terribly overpriced.",

But the surprising part was the garnishes... there was some kind of garlic butter spinach on top, and the plate was lined with a pesto sauce (can't remember what kind).  The tastiest part of the meal, however, (besides the salmon) was the creamed white corn that the salmon rested upon.  I've never liked creamed corn (from the can) but this was VERY good.  It had the consistency of Cream of Wheat, and not the nasty, slimy creamed corn you used to eat as a kid.  Great, great food... I will definitely go back, I'd like to try one of their steaks next time I go.",

    "text": "3.75 stars.  You want to know what easily was the biggest disappointment of my last Vegas trip?  That I didn't get to have a second session of drinking with Dave, one of the most awesome bartenders I have ever met.  Seriously, if you happen to be in the MGM Grand in the next two or three months, take the opportunity to sidle up the bar if you happen to see a tall bald headed dude working.  You won't regret it.    My first night on my last trip to Vegas involved a moderately lengthy stay at the bar at Wolfgang Puck.  It was a slow night, and the bartender inquired about what was obviously a look of pain on my face.  \"I hope my face doesn't contort like that when I'm playing poker,\" I noted, knowing full well that it certainly does not.  He asked what was bothering me, I told him, and then I stated that it wasn't really a big deal (and it's not).  He then proceeded to tell me what happened to him the previous night, and let's just say it put EVERYTHING into perspective.  The night was still young, and before you knew it, there were rounds upon rounds of drinks, including two comped ones on Dave, as we ran the gamut of his own incredible night and simultaneously mocked the idea of what most people consider problems.  As I was leaving, he noted, \"You get it.\"  He was talking about life.  And he gets it as well.    There are other reasons to come here aside from incredible service.  The actual drinks at the bar were nicely prepared, including a Manhattan preparation nicely chilled with carved ice.  The bar is well stocked with fun rye whiskeys, scotches, and bourbons as moderate price points.  The Shishito peppers and short ribs I ordered may have been short of magnificent, but were solid nonetheless.  At worst, it is certainly a reasonable alternative to NobHill for those who'd like something nice while avoiding L'Atelier's pricing.    While I get this isn't exactly destination dining and the atmosphere is kind of weird (located in the middle of the MGM Grand), it isn't a bad place, especially on Fight Night, to watch the legions of craziness descend upon MGM Grand while sipping nice cocktails and judging everyone in your vicinity.  Yeah, I think I'll go back here on my next Vegas trip.",

The staff was still very friendly, and service was quick. I ordered the Prosciutto/Olive/and Goat cheese pizza, the crust was crunchy not soggy and the flavors blended well. Others with me had the minestrone soup, loved it and two had the Chinois Chicken Salad, they raved about it. We all ordered a glass of wine here, the wine was much better and less expensive than Rouge. Two thumbs up!!  Day two. On a quick break from the conference I was attending, two of us in the goup decided to go back for lunch. Again, service was very friendly and service quick. This time I ordered the minestrone soup and I have to say it really was delicious. The beans cooked perfectly and the veggies were done with a bit of crunch. I would have licked the bowl if I could have, it really was so good.",

    "text": "Soup and salad $25... Worth every penny. I would do it again in a heartbeat. Reason... the flavors were spot on. I enjoyed both dishes more and more with each bite. Chicken soup and Butter lettuce Caesar's salad simple but I liked the attention to detail. Lettuce was very fresh (I grow my own, so I appreciate this). Very simple but the flavors were very well balanced. Chicken soup, again very simple but very well balanced. Chicken, had very nice flavor - brined?  Wife had fish and chips. She loved it.Fries were crispy, just the way she liked it. Fish was fresh, batter very light and crispy. Funny, fish reminded me of deep fried dish In some fish tacos I had down at a SHACK down in Baja. Both are are excellent, except the one in Baja were $1 a piece. You don't have to pay top dollar to get good food.  Service, excellent. They were all attentive and friendly.  Overall a great time. We will be back.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  We were back for a second meal... This one dropped on all counts. Pear and Apple salad was too vinegary and overdressed. Why do people like so much dressing on their salad? My mistake to not ask for the dressing on the side - thought they would respect the freshness of the produce and dress it properly.  Pizza was good, but was only okay for $15. Reminded me of CPK.  Service was good but not very friendly.  5 stars for the first visit, 3 for the second. 4 stars overall",

We order two plates which they split in half so we could each try a little of both plates. The prime rib sandwich was perfect, and the spaghetti was amazing.

Plus my boyfriend is wearing sandals and I'll be damned if I'm going to hike all the way back to the Riviera (!) to change. Ugh... Oh? What's this? A bar and grill in the middle of the casino? Hmmm... Oh, it's Wolfgang Puck? Ok, hell, why not. I'm a sucker for celebrity chefs.   We walk in at about 10:10 pm and are seated promptly, our waiter almost immediately coming by to ask for drink orders. All I had was water and the bf had a beer. Menu was interesting... like a bar and grill menu done right. Good old chicken wings and pizzas, as well as things like tuna tartare and crab cakes. I ended up getting the steak skewers and a Caesar salad. The bf got the burger.  Let's see here.... (thinking back through a hazy fog of blurred-together Vegas memories)... The bread basket they brought: okay but cold. The boyfriend liked the olive foccacia, I would have liked it if it weren't the temperature of an ice cube. The Caesar: meh. The low point of the meal. I liked how the romaine leaves were left whole for me to cut up, but I didn't care for the dressing. Little too lemony. My own homemade Caesar dressing is better. Plus I kinda like croutons, The bruschetta was pretty good, but the croustini could have been a little less thin and wafer-y. (Yes, I know, I'm being ultra-picky.) The steak skewers: Yum. Cooked perfectly. Nice presentation. Tasty house-made steak sauce. Someone else said the slaw it came with was underdressed, and they were completely right. Actually It wasn't really dressed at all. But I could excuse that, cuz the steaks were so yummy. Here's the pathetic part: I was feeling so shitty that I couldn't even finish the entire tiny little appetizer. There's five skewers, with about three or four bites of steak on each. I ended up taking two back to my room. Yeah. Beyond sad. But man they tasted good cold at three in the morning...   The bf's burger: Can't really offer any useful commentary as I was not even remotely interested in taking a bite... under normal circumstances i would have been all over it. His fries were awesome though. I wish all bars had fries like this... and menus like this...   We had to box up our food and scramble the eff outta there cuz for some fool reason we wanted to rush up the strip to see the last free pirate show thingy at TI.... which they cancelled anyway when we got there at the last second. C'est la Vegas, I guess. But yes, Wolfgang Puck is pretty good grubbin' for the money, and a great option if you don't happen to be clad in business casual at the moment and/or don't feel like spending $100+ on dinner.",

    "text": "It was close to 10pm midweek in Vegas and we were both starving and desperately needing something for dinner. We walked past this restaurant and decided to give it a shot. The decor was beautiful and from the moment we walked in the service was superb. Looking at the menu I was excited to try a number of things. I settled on their house sangria, bbq chicken pizza and the blue cheese truffle chips. As soon as J heard that red snapper was the fish special of the day he knew he had to order it. We were both really impressed with the truffle chips, they melted in my mouth and I could have made an entire meal out of them. When we got our entrees I dug into the bbq chicken pizza which was good but nothing outstanding. J's excitement about the red snapper quickly faded when he realized it was completely raw on the inside. We notified the server and he quickly whisked it away to get a new piece of fish cooked. About 15 minutes later he came back with another piece of fish and had J cut into it while he was standing there and sure enough the fish was raw again. Another 15 minutes later he came back out and the fish was no longer raw (yay) but as J was eating it he didn't have much to say except for the fact that it was now so overcooked that it was dry and had lost most of the flavor. By this time it was late, he was hungry and didn't want to wait for yet another piece of fish so he still ate it. A few minutes after finishing our entrees we got a surprise from our server who brought us coffee and a phenomenal chocolate souffle on the house due to the errors with the fish. It was a really nice touch by our server because he truly did seem frustrated for us with how messed up the fish kept being. I want to try this place again next time we are in Vegas because the service was top notch, but hopefully the food will be more consistent next time",

We told it to our waiter and not only he suggested the best dished that they could provide to meet our needs, but also he managed to give us the most enjoyable dinner time by maneuvering everything from taking orders to handling the check.  We had Chevre and apple salad, Spaghetti with meat ball and Chevre and Sweet pea tortellini. They were all good, especially the tortellini, which reminded me of the same kind of pasta dish I had in Tuscany :)",

    "text": "After a long day in Vegas we checked in to the MGM Grand and were looking for a casual restaurant close by to eat at. Although I have heard his (Wolfgang Puck) name throughout the years many times, I have never ate at any of his restaurants or had any of his frozen meals. I ordered the mussels and were very surprised when they came because there had to be 50+ mussels on the plate. They were good (but not great). My kids had the Spicy Meatball Pasta (it was a little to spicy for my son although he does like spicy foods) & the Homemade Spaghetti (daughter loved it). My wife had a steak which was good but did not leave a lasting impression. The service was great until it was time for the check when we didn't see our waiter for 15 mins. Bottom line is that Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is a nice casual place to get a bite to eat (at the MGM Grand), just don't expect to be blown away by the food. 3 1/2 stars.",

Since the drink I had here was not the first of the evening, or afternoon rather, my memory of this place is a little foggy. But I do remember cute waiters and cringe-worthy prices. I had gnocchi which did not make me swoon, but the pizza kinda did and so did the chocolate mousse cake. Also, I like the fact that the portions are small. Minimalist decor, but warm and modern, i think the furniture is from ikea, or at the very least some scandinavian country. Its in the middle of the MGM Grand, so check out the tigers while you are there and marvel at mans triumph over nature.",

Firstly nothing really fun or interesting about this restaurant. Just another standard place open to the casino floor.  Food was ok- we all had pizzas, salads and calamari but after going to Lavo on the last night this place SUCKED for the same price point.  I would tell people to make the effort to go to Lavo (at Palazzo) instead.  My calamari at WPuck was greasy, a small helping and lots of tentacles for abou $14.  At Lavo it was plentiful (enough for 3 ppl!!), so tender, no tentacles and $16!!!  Puck's was not the worst but not the best by a mile.",

    "text": "Was in vegas for a few nights on vacation. I wanted to check out this WP Bar & Grill in the MGM. I checked the hours and planned my day around a late dinner here, all good so far.  We arrive at the MGM and ask a Security Guard which way it is, he says it is closed and they close early whenever they feel like it type deal.. um ok? Leave bummed, not much open, end up at Denny's :|  I double check the hours and they should have been open. Anyways the next day I call and speak to a manager(didn't get \"her\" name). I explain the situation to her. She said they close early on that particular for \"years\" and that I probably got the wrong hours from google or a 3rd party site. No worries, maybe I made a mistake perhaps and thank her for her time.  I check online, google, MGM, and then WP Bar & Grill's own site, they should have been open! I call back and explain this to her, she proceeds to scream at me, yelling, and berating me! I am in utter shock, I've never been treated this way before. She yells \"what do you want me to do about it now?!?!?!?!\". I explain I based my day around eating at this location and some form of a comp would be nice, she yells at me some more and says \"no\". I ask for her name and she puts me on a endless hold to get rid of me.  I call back and explain to the girl that answers the phone(not her), I speak to a different Manager Brad - who was very professional and polite btw. He apologizes and asks me to come back in and he will take care of us. I explain to him I actually have a reservation at WP Lupo tonight but would try to come in the next day.  On our way to Lupo we passed the WP Bar & Grill in MGM and we got to speak to Brad in person. Again, he was very nice and apologetic, encouraging us to come in.  I explained we were literally on her way to Lupo but would likely come back tomorrow.  We never ended up coming back the next day but after some time at Lupo we wondered why were getting bonus dishes, appetizers, and desert compliment's of the chef. Brad went a step beyond and actually called Lupo and made things more than right for us.  I would have left 1 star based purely on the insane manager I first encountered but it would be wrong to fault WP as a whole for her actions. Brad rectified the situation even though we were unable to find the extra time to come back and eat there, so I am neutral at 3 stars... and 5 stars for Brad and for WP Lupo(which I will review separately).  I'd still recommend WP Bar & Grill as it genuinely did look good, just look out for a crazy Manager, who hopefully is no longer there or has been reprimanded.",

We were able to get in with a 20 minute wait and they text you when your table is ready, so you can wander off and gamble.  Everyone was rushing around the restaurant like they were crazy, but it didn't seem particularly busy, just steady.  Our server was fairly attentive and everything was delivered quickly.  We were feeling pasta and I had the sweet fennel sausage bolognese while the husband had spaghetti and meatballs and both were delicious, although I have to say his spaghetti and meatballs were the better of the two.  The meatballs were so tasty yet had a delicate well made texture to them.  The bread that they serve is fantastic and warm.  My only disappointment was they were out of burrata and I REALLY was craving burrata and tomato salad... actually, I still am!  Overall, it was a good service, delicious food, reasonably priced and we were in and out pretty quickly.  Definitely recommend.",

Calamari was very bland, \"red\" sauce was out of a Sam's Club can, Caesar salad was overdressed and contained radicchio, and the pizza was notable only for a decent thin crust - cheese was thin and leather-y, tomato sauce very thinly applied, and there were only a half dozen small pieces of basil.  Should have had some fresh tomatoes in one form or another, decent cheese, and a lot more basil.  Also very noisy, with Puck's music competing with the casino music.  Good service, however.    If you're in the MGM and want a decent meal, try Fiamma instead.  Cheaper, quieter, better food.",

    "text": "Our dinner started out great and ended up crappy.  I'll cut to the chase to say, our server, Evan was nice but at the end of the meal got lazy and unattentive.  The danger of an open kitchen- you can see your dessert done and no one picks it up.  Our skillet brownie sat there for 10 minutes, while the banana ice cream melted.   No one picked it up.  It sat on the counter while the Pastry Chef paid no attention to it.  She let it rot there.  If it was me, I'd be yelling for a server or food runner.   The other danger of a slow night is everyone standing around.  At one point, while our dessert was sitting, there were 7 servers and bussers STANDING in the back area near their POS.  This is a managers nightmare.  But we never saw a manager.    I'm giving this dinner 2 stars for starting off good and for our food- crab cakes, chinois chinese salad, Linguine Fra Diavolo and the Wild Mushroom Ravioli.    Servers - when you drop a check, pick it up.  Our server chose to talk to another table and never came back.  Another server picked up our check after we waited 15 min.    The service in Vegas is usually very good.  This was not.  Sorry, Wolfgang.  This ones a miss.",

The only flavor was from the hard as heck bread and too many alfalfa sprouts. I make much better more flavorful chicken salad. It tasted like it had nothing in it but mayo and chicken. I expected pizazz. My family's food was also just ok which is fine if you are paying ok prices. $18 for a chicken salad sandwich that tastes like it came out of a vending machine is not ok with me. We will not be back. Corporate takeover has failed these Iron Chefs who are not conducting oversight.",

It's rare to find dishes like this at hoity toity (sp?) strip restaurants.  Number two, the octopus salad.  The dressing is some sort of lime and chili concoction I believe.

No sooner did I finish my dinner, then out came an incredible vanilla bean creme brulee with little pieces of cut fresh fruit on top and Happy Birthday perfectly drawn in chocolate on the serving plate.

We ordered: - caesar's salad: this was pretty good, especially the anchovies - yum! - spaghetti and meatballs: the noodles were strange, I'm pretty sure that they're not Italian pasta or maybe it was a \"healthier\" alternative and that didn't taste too good. The meatballs though, they're perfectly cooked - salmon: my friend got this dish and it was alright - he wasn't too crazy about it Overall, it was a meh experience.

You go eat because Vegas has become a haven for foodies within the last ten years (and because you're a bit of a chunky monkey who thinks about food first). Anyway, fast forward to us driving around with both our phones tuned to the Yelp! app to find a good place to eat. Thankfully we skipped the likes of IHOP and Denny's near the airport to find a Wolfgang Puck's restaurant open 24/7 in the MGM. Yeah that's right, forget the little sandwich delis that used to be the only place a gambler could get a late-night bite in a casino, it's now all celebrity chefs and gourmet food.  The restaurant is terraced slightly higher than the gambling floor, but has a completely open view so you can munch away and do some people watching at the same time. The menu had several good options, but we decided on the Truffle Potato Chips and Wood Oven Mushroom pizza. The truffle potato chips are crazy good; fresh fried potato chips that are still warm drizzled with a super rich blue cheese sauce and topped with with bits of truffle. How can you read that description and not start to salivate? The pizza was also solid.  Bottom line, whether you're commiserating after having just lost a fortune or are a gourmand on a late-night munchie quest, my buddy Wolfgang won't disappoint you.",

We had ordered two appetizers to share and they didn't bring them out. When they brought our entrees, I told them to cancel out appetizers. Later they brought out appetizers!! And still charged us for them even though we barely touched them.   But my snapper entree was very good, everyone else enjoyed their entrees  and my group enjoyed the bread basket.   We ate here because we were going to a show at the MGM afterwards.  The services was so embarrassingly sloppy, I doubt we want to be made to feel so bad again by coming back.",

I will admit I was drinking while playing craps so my memory of the discussion with the waiter may be a bit skewed but I do remember him telling me what were the best gluten free menu items.  They did not have a gluten free menu but the waiter was able to tell me what items were safe.  I settled on the flank steak and mashed potatoes. I gotta say the flank steak was delicious. Cooked to a medium perfection that I love and flavored extremely well, I remember enjoying every bite of this dish. I cleaned my plate for sure.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the whole visit at the restaurant and do not remember if I asked the normal questions to our waiter but I felt fine after the visit and didn't have any sickness problems after dining at Wolfgang Puck.",

Pizza seems like the only choice, so it was so great to find a real restaurant by such a great chef open late to serve hungry people. We attended a concert on a Monday and we didn't get out until very late and were needed to eat some food. This place did not disappoint. We got seated right away and our waiter was amazing. He was incredibly on point with the menu and able to answer any questions from our group. My husband and I shared a salad and a burger. I told the waiter that  we were sharing and they evenly split both items, which was really great. The Cesar salad was simple but the dressing was amazing and evenly coated the lettuce. It came with cherry tomatoes and unlike most restaurants that serve things that look like tomatoes but never actually tastes like them, these were amazing, they were sweet and actually tasted like a real tomato. The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. It came with fries too which were great.Three of us all got  the same burger. One friend got a pepperoni pizza and was very pleased and someone got the crab cakes. Once the food arrived no one spoke, everyone amerced themselves in eating and everyone was incredibly pleased. there were several cocktails - two moscow mules and I had an amazing cocktail here is was a lima sour I believe and it was plum/lime inspired. I ordered it because I had never heard of it and it was great. Two thumbs up and my first visit to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. If/when we are in MGM I plan on eating here again.",

Josh the bartender is easily one of the best on the strip, and there are a lot of bartenders on the strip. He is extremely friendly, and provides fast courteous service and makes you feel welcome.  (I had just lost a bundle & probably didn't tip him enough!  I'll get you next time Josh!!)  I had left my rewards card on the bar & Josh left his post & chased after me to be sure I got it!

It was really good, but I'm not sure there is much you can do to make that really stick out and showcase a restaurant. But in the end, I can still remember parts of that sandwich that caught my attention. Bread was toasted so that it was the right combination of crispy and soft (not scratching up your mouth), and it was thick enough to get a mouthful without making it impossible to eat. Good balance of meats to non-meat ingredients.  Might have to go back and try other stuff, but for a quick bite before hitting the road, totally reasonable stop.",

I noticed one patron who got an undercooked hamburger and left half of it uneaten.  I also noticed one patron who got tough steak skewers.  For the price, they really should have better consistency.  However, I've always enjoyed my meal.  The space is a bit cramped at the bar.  It seems the space wasn't well planned.  Casinos need more bar space as there are a lot more single patrons.  It's like casino planners think the more slots they have the more customers they will have.  I've never seen a person choose (from the dozens of places to go) the venue based on the number of available slots (there are always hundreds available).  However, my friends and I usually start the night off with a meal, so the better the restaurant choices, the more likely we'll start off there.",

We headed on down to the MGM and walked around for a while before finding it.   It was a Friday just before noon, so it was a little early, and we were seated right away.   We took one look at the menu and both knew exactly what we were having. I started with a Raspberry Lemon Drop martini and he started with a Coors Light. I got a Cuban Sandwich and my dining companion got a Roast Beef Panini. Both came with homemade potato chips.   The atmosphere was comfortable and casual, yet very appealing and not loud for being in the middle of the casino.   The food came rather quickly, just as the place was starting to fill up.   The sandwiches were great! My Cuban had the right amount of everything, including pickles on the side so I could add more. I typically do not care for homemade potato chips - apparently these were the exception. Dining companion really enjoyed his roast beef. The arugula was a nice touch to the sandwich.   Overall a great meal. I would go back without hesitation. In and out in under an hour.   The food great, the service spot on without being annoying and the price fair at $50 for everything plus tip.",

The food was good (read: PORK BELLY BLT), our server was nice, drinks were brought out quickly and water was filled promptly. However, the service was SUPER slow. and I don't mean the kitchen was slow. I mean we all almost finished our drinks and then some, and our food order had still not been taken yet. And it was definitely not crowded at all while we were there. Open tables abound!  We ate family style (cuz that's how we roll). Food rating:  Sausage pizza: Good. Although we did not see actual sausage bits on it. Looked a lot like the Sopresata pizza: Also good. Tasty! Fuji Apple salad: Pretty darn good. Crisp and light. Chips: AWESOMENESS. Covered in melty cheesy goodness with bleu cheese chunks and parsley. Nom Nom Nom Pork Belly BLT: The absolute shiznit. Orgasmically delicious. I deconstructed that bitch and ended up just eating the meat. Hella good! Almost good enough to earn Wolfgang another star, but my feet hurt from walking to and from the conference and all over McCarran airport, in 5 inch heels and I am not in a giving mood right now. Pineapple ginger mojito: Good, but I'd prefer the Raspberry lemon drop: Really good if lemon drops are your thing. They're not MY thing, but this one was pretty damn good (like how I like my men: strong, and able to quench my thirst).  Our server was really really nice though, and accommodated us by splitting our bill three ways (for ease of company expensing later). Employees were nice and smiled and greeted us as we came/left. Overall, good experience. Had a good time with the work peeps - The only downside was the wait , so minus one star, especially because we ran the risk of being late to the first session of the conference. To be clear I started with four stars because the food overall was not so great to give it five.  Three stars, covered in braised pork belly!",

Unfortunately, the MGM restaurant scenario is starting to require you to win some money at craps or Blackjack, so that you can afford their dinners. This place is nice and the least expensive between the restaurants of the hotel. However, I don't think it's anything that special. The food is good and cooked well, but $25 for a plate of pasta feels a bit much, don't you think? The service was good and the decor is nice as well. But you turn the eyes and you're still next to a gambling table...I can't really make up my mind on this place. It's average...I would call it an upscale version of a Cheesecake Factory with some better cooking!",

A personal thing I dislike about these types of restaurants though is that they have the water glasses out forever until someone sits at the table, that makes the glasses smell bad once you put water in them. I think it's just me though, but I had to stop breathing when I drank water so I wouldn't have to smell the wet dirty glass smell. Like I said though, this is a personal thing, and maybe other people can't distinguish the \"smell\" like I can.  I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the cod, the salmon was extremely good and so was the cod, the salmon took the cake though. We had a side of brussels sprouts (I love them) and the pork belly bacon they used was very awesome as well, I could have just ordered two sides by themselves and made it a meal!  Overall, I loved it and will go back when we go back to Vegas. We were staying at the MGM so the walk from our room to the restaurant was negligible which was also a huge plus!",

I wanted to pull the plate to me, put my arms around it, and growl mine, mine, mine like a little kid.  I like that the restaurant is located just steps from the gaming floor and opened late. The decor and ambiance is open and bright. Prices are typical Vegas hiked casino fare, but that's pretty much everywhere on the strip.

Definitely not a good place for a first date or a meeting or catch-up-talk-story kind of place because it is open to the public but my boyfriend & I enjoyed ourselves, nonetheless. We were shouting at each other rather than talking cause it was so loud but we were laughing the whole time. It was fun.   Now that you've been warned about the noise, onto the food. It's delicious. Seriously. The complementary bread and butter was yummy and they didn't hesitate to give us seconds once we were done with our first basket. Oh, and the servers were great! Very friendly and attentive. Refilled our drinks almost instantaneously. Okay, back to the food. My boyfriend got the Grilled Burger. It was huge, tasty, juicy and flavorful. He devoured it.   I ordered the Jidori Chicken and Potato Puree with Veggies. I practically slurped that Rosemary Jus because it was just yummy. The chicken is pan seared and baked. Honestly, the juiciest chicken I have ever had in my life. Not dry or over-salted at all.. it was seasoned perfectly and I was sad after my last bite.  Since we were locals, we ended with a complementary dessert to share. (They won't ask if you're local. Just tell them you are & they will be more than happy to hand you the dessert menu). We got the Beignets with Citrus Custard inside and Caramel Dipping Sauce. I wasn't a big fan of the citrus custard and would have loved for it be simply a vanilla custard but I liked it for the most part.   The price is cheaper than most restaurants on the strip. I was looking for something that wasn't solely burgers but I didn't want to splurge too much so this place was a great choice. Will definitely be back someday!",

It's MGM casinos all around but in the middle is a really nice, upscale, elegant place for modern dining. I think the setting could be perfect for every occasion-- date, group of friends, family, business, etc.  I ordered the pizza which was the least successful out of all the dishes I tried. The pizza itself was okay, but if you're gonna have pizza at fine dining, it generally needs to be very creative and different, or just mind-blowingly awesome. The pizza is on par with other pizzas, but more pricey. You're better off trying other dishes on the menu.  I had a couple bites of a sweet corn and cheese ravioli which was fantastic. Everything on the plate balanced really well together and you could tell the fresh quality of the ingredients on the plate. A friend also ordered a halibut with spinach which was amazing. I'd recommend trying those!   The service was great and the food was reasonably priced. What more could you ask for?",

    "text": "So a friend and I was walking around MGM looking for a place to eat before our show. We werent dressed up so that eliminated all the fancy restaurants.. It was either Wolfgang Puck, The food court or Rainforest Cafe.. and I was not going to eat at the food court or rainforest an over priced sit down version of the food court.. So we had no choice but to eat at Wolfgang Puck.. honestly i am not a big fan of wolfgang puck but it beats the food court.. As i entered in the restaurant with a complete attitude of \" I hate wolfgang puck\" , my mood started to change....   The waiters and staff greeted you welcoming you into wolfgang puck..I was slowly start to brush off the i ahte wolfgang puck attitude...  As we sat down water and beverage was taken immediately.. i said to myself hmmmm... ineteresting.. love how fast they work...  The server was really friendly and informative.. gave us the specials and had a positive attitude really good guest service skills pretty impressed..  I was pretty impressed how often they refilled our water and bread basket without being told..  So the food finally came and i was in shock. I was supirsed how huge the portions were.. I ordered the burger and my freind had the pizza i must say DAYUM! Wolfgang! i am impressed.. loved the juicey burger and loved the fries.. PIzza was awesome also!  For dessert we had the Banana siffoule it was mmm mmmm good!  Overall Wolfgang shocked the crap outta me.. Love this place! ive had the wolfgang puck cafes at the airport and was not impressed at all that's why i was a bit hesitant to eat at this wolfgang puck but im glad i gave it a second try and i would definitely dine here again!",

Highlight of our meal was the asian chicken salad... lots of greens, lots of crispiness, and lots of flavor.  Ordered the Mushroom Pizza as well... eh... not the greatest.  Was quite dry and unspectacular...  Also had the burger which was quite delicious... thick and juicy patty but for $17 you just can't justify paying that much for it... (until you remember you're in a casino).  Overall, this is a nice option.  Nothing too fancy here though...  there are a lot of better (and more expensive) options in Vegas if you're looking to excite your taste buds!",

    "text": "\"Wolfgang Puck\" equals top-notch cooking with the sensible, clean tastes of California cuisine. But then there's \"Bar and Grill\" which equals accessible, unpretentious food. And this combination is exactly what this restaurant provides. The menu was mostly pizzas and pastas in the $15 to $25 range plus the usual range of entrees ranging from $25 to the more than $50 steaks.  Jeannene and I went with the the crispy-fried calamari appetizer. The batter and tenderness is what you would expect from any restaurant, let alone Wolfgang Puck's, but the star of this plate was the lemon aioli which was the perfect thick (but not goopy) creamy consistency and had the necessary acid. For the main course, I had the rigatoni with sweet fennel sausage bolognese. It was a creamy bolognese, which I've never had, and the rigatoni were half the size than the pasta I'm used to. Both were improvements as the pasta was not clunky and the sauce had the cheese factor you often expect in an Italian dish. Jeannene had a corn tortellini that she had no compaints about.  To drink, I had the Trampled Rose, which featured rye whisky with five-spice syrup and cranberry liquor. The sweetness countered the blunt rye, which in turn kept the sweetness from being cloying. It tasted like Thanksgiving. Normally I get two different drinks but this time I demanded an encore,  As far as ambiance, it is an open-walled dining room in the MGM Grand's casino so it is either irritatingly noisy or full of energy depending on your mindset going in. As for me, the simple, perfect foods lowered the level of pretenciousness so I'm going with \"calm amid the casino storm.\"",

Our total bill was less than $50, and that included 2 non-alcoholic (boooooring) drinks on top of the food mentioned.

    "text": "I ate lunch at Bar & Grill on Thursday during the first day of the NCAA tourney.  I sat at the bar, which was served by a single bartender.  She appeared to be VERY busy to the point I think they should have had someone else over there.  But, for the most part, she managed.  I didn't have to wait on water refills or anything like that.  But, she was in need of some help I think.  I had the BBQ chicken panini with fries.  On the side, I requested the maytag blue cheese sauce they served with their potato chip appetizer.  The sandwich was very good, and large.  The onions were caramelized nicely and the sauce was more sweet, but didn't totally lack for flavor.  I prefer things a little spicier.  The fries were thin and had herbs sprinkled on them.  They needed salt and pepper, and were really good when those were added.  Large order.  The maytag blue cheese sauce is crazy good.  They clearly just made it, as the bowl was warm and there were still a couple of chunks of cheese that hadn't melted.  The blue cheese flavor comes through and the herbs they add complement it well.  This is an excellent dipping sauce, get it if you come.  They charged me $3.33 for it, which was fine, but I was not told that when I ordered it.  So, that was surprising to find on the bill, but it's worth it.  I just would prefer they mention it when I ordered it.  The beer selection left a lot to be desired.  Only 6 on tap.",

I had the Prosciutto pizza which came topped with San Marzano tomatoes, goat cheese, mozzarella, wild arugula, and you guessed it...prosciutto. The prosciutto was like butter! It was thinly sliced and just melted in my mouth. At first, I thought the kitchen may have left the goat cheese off but a few bites into it, it made its presence known. Wasn't visible, but a tasty hidden gem! The crust was thin and delicious! Had the char marks from the wood fire oven and a nice crunch.

Every single adult LOVED their meal.  I had a huge salad with fresh roasted chicken and a bowl of chicken noodle soup.  It was absolutely yummy!! The pasta dishes around me were equally as good (piggie me sampled most of them). And most importantly, the service was great.

It's rather small, but has a large glass party room. Small bar!   If you're ok with spicy, get the grilled shrimp appetizer! The shrimp are huge, the polenta pairs perfectly and the spicy red pepper sauce gives it the perfect kick.  The Halibut was good, but nothing special.

Started with spicy tuna tartare, the chips were so thin and crispy, fresh tuna with avocado on top, light with enough flavors.   Steamed black mussels, with French fries: the mussels were so tender, great with the creamy cheese sauce, the sausages in it looked so yummy, but I couldn't taste it.   Hubby had clam linguini, same as I ordered last time: very delicious, the texture of the linguini was perfect, the smoked crispy pork belly bites were so flavorful.   I had a Bloody Mary first, it was a weak drink, I ordered a Corona too. Our food was very good, not too heavy for late night, but still satisfying. The service was good like always.

So shady. The waitress asked if we wanted still or sparkling. We said still. The bus guy came over and poured our glasses with water. A minute later our waitress came with a bottle of water and pushed away our other water glasses and filled new ones with that. That water was $9 on our bill.   The waitress, like a used car saleswoman, kept trying to sell some appetizer to every table. She would give a hard sell and say she would refund it if people didn't like it. It was easier for us to say no because I don't eat duck, but you would not believe how salesey she was. I was kind of afraid of her - she had very odd energy.  I don't recommend this place.   Mediocre food, but what do you expect at 2am I guess.",

So good and flavorful, not as heavy as I would have thought. Chicken salad-5 stars. This salad is huge and is so filling. Candied cashews, huge chunks of chicken, wontons, cilantro, plus much more. This salad has an amazing dressing with a wasabi flavor giving it a kick. Would definitely eat here again.",

    "text": "This place is so amazing! Let's start off the least liked item we ordered... The truffle chips with blue cheese sauce. They were mediocre. They didn't have an over powering blue cheese taste, however had a strong smell of the truffle oil. Also They are potato chips not fries.   Second item we ordered was the Caesar salad. And wow it was delicious. It isn't a classic Caesar salad because the dressing they use is a garlic dressing. But wow it is really really good. (Mouth is watering as I am typing the review). The romaine leaves were not chopped up, but more of a rustic approach. With tomatoes on top. And a few croutons on top.  Third item we ordered was the spaghetti and meatballs!! Holy moly!!! This was one of the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had. The meat balls are homemade. We had them split it for two and man it is a lot of food! We couldn't even finish it.   They also give complementary bread, however we opted out. Didn't get to try the dessert but I am sure it's great since everything else was fantastic. The staff here is very friendly. Would def. come Back! Great vibe and beyond delicious late night dinner.",

The food was consistently good, yummy in fact, but nothing really stuck out and the menu didn't have anything particularly interesting for my taste. Crab cakes were definitely nice and meaty-not starchy like they can be in some places- and the sauce that came with it is good. The steak skewers tender and good- reminded me of home made bbq. The Pinot Grigio I had was decent. Overall good experience if you're looking good, affordable food late night at the MGM.",

I'm a bit of a foodie and tend to avoid restaurant chains, but my husband and I were at the MGM late one night and felt like eating at 1 AM!  Wolfgang Puck was very noticeable because the restaurant is very bright and very open. Which made it look very welcoming. We sat at the bar and our bartender was very friendly and took the time to go over some popular items on the menu with us.  My husband got the burger which was soooo good! The meat patty was thick and cooked perfectly. The bun was fluffy and tasted fresh. Fries were crunchy. It was just a damn.good.burger. I got the spaghetti and meatballs which did not disappoint. I couldn't tell if the spaghetti was handmade or not, but it tasted amazing. Meatballs were perfectly flavored. And the red sauce wasn't overpowering. They also topped it with mozzarella cheese and basil which was made all the flavors come together nicely!  We got the apple crumble for dessert which was sweet and crunchy and came with vanilla ice cream! I was very impressed with this place. The food was great. Service was great. Everything was reasonably priced. Beautiful and bright atmosphere. Will definitely come back.",

They can't be that outstanding if I don't care to recall exactly what they were.  I DOOOOOOO remember our appetizer though. We saw a tables nearby with all the same thing!! So we wanted it too. Turns out their truffle chips with blue cheese was one of the most popular items on the menu. After biting into one, I could see why. Explosion of flavor with every bite. It became too much when you kept eating it without alternating flavors.   If you are to eat here, I recommend the TRUFFLE POTATO CHIPS!!",

We started out with the Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese and man, this sh*t was bomb!  I normally don't like blue cheese at all, but it must have been a really good grade because it tasted great and didn't smell at all.    After we shared the Spicy Soprasata, Salami Toscana and Pepperoni with Green Chilies Pizza and this even topped the chips!  If you've ever read my reviews or been to Gaspare's and ordered the Bruce's Special, you're gonna love this pizza.  Not as good, but great in its own way because it's different.    Didn't have any trouble with slow service like other reviewers stated, but we did sit at the bar and took it back to the room.  Bartender was very friendly and made sure we always had water, lol.  I am definitely looking forward to coming here again and sampling items apart from the late night menu.  I know Wolfgang has a few restaurants in Vega$ so hit me up if you know of one I should try!",

On second thought, maybe I would return if I ever find myself in Las Vegas, dining alone, and have remembered to bring my earplugs.",

    "text": "Wolfgang Puck was our first stop after arriving in Las Vegas. Hungry and tired from the long flight (just kidding it was only an hour) we needed to have lunch and a drink. We had our 21-year-old Grandaughter with us, and found it just weird to hear her order a drink- She was a baby just yesterday. She got carded and took great joy in showing her ID. The bartender spotted it immediately. He surprised her later with a fabulous dessert. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and I must say, they were right up there with some of the best. Mr. H enjoyed a scrupulous pulled pork sandwich. Our girl ordered a Pizza. It's True that the old Wolfgang knows his pizza. If this franchise were in Oakland I would start eating pizza.   Now, for baby girls dessert. On a very large plate, a slice of banana cream pie was placed next to a halved Bruleed banana. I believe that was the best banana I ever tasted. I mean really...who brulees a banana. \"Nothing says dessert like a propane torch\". Yes there was even a dollop of whipped cream. AND, on the plate, in chocolate, was a hand written Birthday wish. What a fabulous way to arrive in Las Vegas. Our experience was so great that we decided at that moment to have our Thanksgiving dinner there. It too was amazing.  Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill is located in the MGM Grand.  I Highly recommend it. It's not to fancy and not to casual.  Great food and great service",

I couldn't decide between salad or pizza and settled on ordering both and requesting a box right away to take the left overs.  The waiter informed me that I could get a half salad, which I did and it was the perfect amount.  I had the chopped vegetable salad with olive bread and creamy greek dressing.  I expected the bread to be soft, but it was fried croutons.  Pretty tasty, but more tangy/vinegary than I expected out of a \"creamy\" dressing.   The pizza was huge.  I had the mushroom, leek, and goat cheese.   Shared with friend and still took half home.  Friend had the cuban sandwich, her plate looked a little sad with just the grilled sandwich and a handful of chips and vast empty plate area crying out for a pickle or green garnish of some sort.  It was pretty tasty, but not really what I expect from a cuban.  The roasted pork had a citrusy marinade and was juicy, but I don't think it went well with the cheese and pickle (sweet).     overall great value.  cuban sandwich, mushroom pizza, salad, and two non-alcoholic drinks, tax + 20% tip = $47",

She took my food order, & before I could get the words out, she walked away before I could even put in my drink order. I waited for her to come back so I could tell her, but she did not come back until we were finished eating. I should have asked one of the many people who brought out our food & cleared our plates, but I thought she would eventually come back...& since it was her job, I'd wait. She came to to give us the check. That is all. It's a good thing the food was good because the waitress was truly bad at her job.",

The Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in the MGM Grand, serves a contemporary \"bar and grill\" menu artfully executed.  The restaurant has an exciting bar and a beautiful glass enclosed private dining room.    I always have a personal gourmet pizza, no you can not have any, It is too good! They are perfecto e mundo.  The Fritto Misto consists of calamari, zucchini, shrimp, olives and served with a lemon aioli, which is exciting to both look at and eat.  His wine list is primarily of California wines and the desserts are made in house.   My husband loves their sandwiches.  The  peppered Prime Beef, with aioli and white cheddar on a baguette with potato salad  or the smoked turkey, ham and bacon club with herb aioli and baby greens are his two favorites.   Prices for sandwiches are between $13.- $16.00.  Pizzas are from $12. - $14., so no breaking the bank here to enjoy a good lunch!",

Get the ginger line iced tea, it was excellent, as was the service - from the host to the busboys, everyone was awesome. OK...Part 2.  Because EVERYTHING at MGM closes at 10pm (except this place), we ate here again the very next night.  We had the chinese chicken salad, brussel sprouts, chicken wings and the chopped veg salad.  Everything was great.  Food that is.  Service was uneven.   We may end up back here again, actually.  I can't believe everything else closes so early.",

There was plenty of chips on the plate for the two of us to share.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her grilled salmon which was moist and flaky. I had the flat iron steak which was very tender and cooked perfectly. I savored each bite with a little of the maytag blue cheese sauce left over from the potato chips. Delish!  The staff is friendly and very efficient. Our server was smiling all the time. Unfortunately, she also didn't check back on us after we started our meal (she showed up immediately after we were served to make sure it \"looked\" okay).  Maybe I hold Puck to higher standards but this restaurant and meal wasn't particularly memorable. I was expecting outstanding and got good. Most of the time that's good enough for four stars. But not a pricey high-profile celeb chef restaurant in Vegas. It's a very solid three.",

I had a ceasar salad and my sister had the greens salad - both of which we very well prepared and not drenched in dressing. The bread before our meal arrived was very good too, especially the one with the onions on top. I also had a glass of the 2012 Napa Chardonnay - nice and crisp. The server was very attentive and willing to make customization to our order. Overall did not feel like a heavy dinner so got exactly what we wanted.",

    "text": "First off, tbh, I've only been here twice. But, both times I was happy with the quality of the food served to us.   This place is located in the MGM Casino, but once you're inside, you kind of forget you're in a casino - unless, of course, you look out the glass things. They have a cool wood design thing around the exit, and the rest is very modern. White tables, glass almost everywhere. I really like it. There's almost always a wait for it, but so far, it's only been about 10 - 15 minutes for us until we're seated.   Generally, everything on their menu is quite pricey. However, I feel like that's simply the cost for going to a celebrity chef's restaurant.   The first time we were here, I got the salmon, which was flaky and good. However, even though it was really empty, our food took forever to get to our table! And to top it off, everything was cold! We were so disappointed. However, our waiter at that time was very courteous. The guy (a cute one, I might add) who brought our food to the table overheard us say we were there to have a dinner celebration for my grandma's birthday. We thought nothing further of it. He disappeared for a while, because he wasn't our waiter. However, at the end of the meal, he came back with a slice of a chocolate tart for us, with a lit candle stuck into it! We were so touched that he remembered (not to mention, it was free! )  Our second time here, the food was way better. Their bread basket is a mixture of all kinds of things, including pretzel bread and carmelized onion topping square of fluffy bread. I was quite satisfied with the overall service, but I feel like the people who work here are quietly snobby. When I asked for another basket of bread (because our food was taking quite a while), the waiter made us repeat our request twice, with an incredulous expression. What? Just because a majority of the people there were pretty girls in short dresses doesn't mean I have to eat the tiny amount they pretend is enough for them. Just give me more bread without your judgement, please!  My mother got the organic chicken with veggies and yukon mashed potatoes. Let me say, I still crave those veggies. I think they were butter sauteed. Whatever it was, it was soo delicious. The chicken was yummy, as well.   I got the lasagna, because I was craving something filling. Though many people would be outraged at me ordering something so simple, I feel like it was well worth it. There's nothing typical about this lasagna. At first glance, I was quite miffed that I had got one small looking square. However, halfway through, I realized that through it was small, whatever was in it made it really hearty. I was full about halfway through.  Yummy!  Another great thing : They're open until 6 am !",

I've eaten here several times and have had the calamari (so-so), the mesquite grilled steak skewers (amazing), truffled potato chips (very good), buffalo cheese pizza (incredible), calves liver (stupid good), caramelized brussel sprouts, yukon gold potato puree, banoffee, and pineapple upside cake with vanilla ice cream.   Basically everything there has been incredibly good. This is another place that I always hit up when I'm in Vegas and I'm hoping the last time I was there was just an off night because I would hate to find it's no longer worth stopping at.",

    "text": "Probably my favorite Wolfgang Puck in Vegas. My lady and I came in late on Friday evening with the restaurant being decently busy. No wait, and we were sat down immediately by a very nice hostess. I started out with a delicious Moscow mule, it was a very classic Moscow mule just extra gingery, which was very nice. We stuck to a couple appetizers and dessert since a big late night meal wasn't what we were going for. We got the crab cakes, tuna tartare, steak skewers, and calamari. The crab cakes were probably the best I've ever had. It tasted SO fresh, not fishy at all and the sauce underneath it was perfect. And perfectly crispy on the top and bottom. Tuna tartare was great. Not fatty, good seasoning and taste. The steak skewers, were a touch fatty, but cooked perfectly with a great Korean style taste. The calamari is really what blew us away. It was perfectly chewy, lightly breaded, great taste, and a great sauce on the side. And FINALLY something different than a spicy aioli on the side. Really really delicious. Loved the shishito peppers that came with it as well.  Dessert was really my only complaint. For such a big chocolate souffle, I felt that one small scoop of ice cream wasn't enough. Overall, it was just OK.  (We went for an additional scoop,$2.50)  Overall, loved the restaurant, food, service and, location. I'd love to come back and give the entrees a shot! And try a different dessert!",

    "text": "Had lunch here.  It's a beautiful restaurant that opens out to the casino.  Chinois Chicken Salad - had this many times before.  It's a good medley of greens topped with crispy wonton strips and candied peanuts.  I wish the dressing was a bit more flavorful, but overall it's a good salad with lots of moist chicken!  BLT - husband had to order this because the menu described it as pork belly.  It looked scrumptuous as the thick bacon, arugula, and tomatoes were between two grilled pieces of sourdough.  IMO, the sandwich was decent but could have tasted WAY better if there was some sort of maple glaze and smokiness to the bacon.  It tasted rather bland...  The side pasta salad was delicious tho!  It was tossed with salume, feta chesses, and some veggies.  Oh, and the appetizer calamari was pretty good.  It arrived looking a little undercooked but it did have a rather nice crunch to it.  The aoili dipping sauce was a wonderful accomaniment to the calamari!  Prices are decent and I think it's a good spot for lunch, especially if you're here for a convention..... Well, you really have no other choice because all the other places are open only for dinner.  Guess I'd be back, but only if I had not other choice.. Or on someone else's dime =)",

Also, we ordered the iceberg lettuce salad with cherry tomatoes, red onion, and extra blue cheese dressing without the bacon. All the veggies were fresh & each bite was crisp & yummy!

Decor: Classic with a modern twist. Their bar was beautiful, and I adored their tableware setup. Although you are quite exposed to casino-goers, you don't notice it as the ambience is very good.   Food: I love bread...especially free bread. Thy give you tons of it! And they're different types (baguette, whole wheat, and even focaccia!), arrive warm, and with tons of butter.  I ordered handmade linguine with mushrooms, which was cooked perfectly. It was a huge portion and very filling. I love handmade pasta, so this was a huge plus. It's also nice to say that I've finally had the chance to try a restaurant by Wolfgang Puck!  Service: Great!!! Never once was my water glass empty, and our waiter checked on us several times throughout the meal. Drink orders were also timely.   I'd definitely go again for the pasta. I'm not sure if the pizza was any good, as no one in my group ordered it, but I'd definitely go back for the bread too!! :3",

The atmosphere felt cozy, and I enjoyed the chill ambience the restaurant gave.   Service for the most part was pretty attentive and brought our drinks out pretty quickly. A couple of us went with one of the IPAs on the menu (forget the name), but it was solid. Otherwise, waters and the complementary bread (which was very fresh & tasty) were refilled frequently without having to ask.   Now as for the entrees, I can understand a bit longer prep time due to having a large group, but I felt the wait was a little ridiculous. We had to wait almost an hour (45~50) minutes for the first few entrees to arrive, and the rest came periodically after. The food itself was good, but I wouldn't say spectacular. They had standard American fare such as burgers, sandwiches, pork chops, and steak options. I went with the steak & fries, and I thought my medium steak came out a little too cooked (the edges tasted burnt and the meat was very stiff in certain areas). Other people who ordered the rib-eye and pork chops had positive responses though.  Overall, the service was attentive and the bread was fantastic. It's a great atmosphere for having a conversation over nice drinks & the food tasted good as well. Only downsides were the wait time and the steak coming out not as desired. Would recommend!",

I came around 3pm and the restaurant was busier than most. I was surprised!  I ordered the BLT, which was delicious. I'm a really big fan of maple glazed bacon, so I had to try the maple glazed pork belly, and I am so glad that I did. The maple glazed pork belly was AMAZING in terms of flavor. The pork belly itself wasn't melt-in-your-mouth orgasmic tasting but it definitely met expectations. I also like how they mashed up the avocados so it was more like an avocado spread rather than slices. It helps spread the avocados into each bite!  I'd come back for the BLT.",

We had chicken wings and crab cakes. Both appetizers were good but the chicken wings were on a different level. I would go back just for those. The service really wasn't too great and considering there were only a couple other tables there at that time there was really no excuse for that. If you're looking for a late night bite with some above average food I would recommend you take a stroll to the MGM and eat at Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill.",

That's what we got on a recent Saturday afternoon (before the big fight...they were busy!) Yet, we still were able to walk right in and plop down at the very busy bar.    Never once were we made to feel wrong for just wanting drinks. Husband really wanted some iced tea, and I was happy to have a nice Chardonnay.  (or two).  Reasonable prices.  Will say that ALL the food we saw get served around us looked awesome.  Had we not been full, we would have happily ordered more. Both of us were glad we picked this place to have an enjoyable refreshing sit-down!",

After 35 minutes and having finished our first course, finally ordered glasses of the well wine so we could get a drink. For a Vegas place to not sell us drinks is crazy. They lost several hundred$ of business that way.  Two entres (ravioli) were sent back... one had no sauce and the other was cold. Beet salad was good and pizza was decent.   Having been to many Puck restaurants (Spago, chinoise on main etc...), I would guess that Puck has never been in this place but just sold them the use of his name...",

We asked our waiter for some olive oil for our bread instead of butter, and he said he'd bring it but he ended up forgetting and we had to ask someone else. For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the sea bass and I ordered he agnolotti. We were surprised that the portions were a lot smaller than we had expected for the price, and this being a 2 dollar sign restaurant. The food was tasty, there just wasn't enough of it. We ended up getting a Chinese chicken salad to split to supplement. The salad actually was huge! They came out on separate plates to begin with so I don't know how large the full salad order actually is, but we were happy with this portion. Looking over at another table, the pizzas look like a decent size too. We decided that if we came back and got a salad and a pizza to split, that would actually be a good deal, so this place can be worth it if you know what to order! Other thing that helps is this place is literally across the room from the entrance to Ka, so if you're planning to see the show, it's super convenient! Overall, I probably wouldn't seek this place out unless you need to be somewhere in the MGM and want a salad and/or pizza!",

Sure, sure...you're probably saying \"it's just another Wolfgang Puck restaurant\" and isn't really considered a \"destination restaurant\" or gourmet.  We choose to come here for quick and casual California-style lunches.  Their wine and beer list isn't really all that extensive but I will say that the beverages are served at a proper temperature.  Their signature truffled potato chips with Point Reyes bleu cheese sauce is a MUST try.    Service is always pleasant, friendly and attentive.  Our server, Jeremy, was a amicable, charming and had a most soothing voice.  His voice mesmerized us as well as his attentiveness.

    "text": "We were drinking at the MGM Grand casino bar area and it was getting late, so we decided to get some grub grub. The bar tender told us that Wolfgang Puck's kitchen is open the latest. So we walk over to get us something to put in our bellies to soak up all that alcomahol.  I ordered the tuna tartare which was probably the highlight of my night. I'm trying to find a picture of this dish, but I guess I forgot. But I do remember the taste and it was definitely sublime. I also remember smashing the heck out of it.  My two friends went with the Bacon Mac and Cheese. I remember trying it out when they asked me if I wanted taste. It was definitely quite good. Prolly one of the best Mac and cheese I've ever had.  Ok, so I'm now a believer. Wolfgang Puck is actually a pretty good restaurant. I've always wondered and never really had the inkling to try this chain out, but now I know. Good food, good service and good company.  Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!",

This restaurant is open to the casino floor, so it's a little louder than most of the others in The District area at the MGM, but not so bad as some. It's fairly smokey though, and honestly, all the smoke is by far the worst thing about Vegas. I split a Fritto Misto and a pizza (Italian sausage with goat cheese and peppers) with my co-worker. The food was ok. Not so great that I would crave it, but edible and nothing tasted bad. The service was good and the prices are average for a restaurant inside a casino. I wouldn't seek this establishment out on a future trip, but wouldn't object to coming back in.",

We sat down here with one of our vendors for a quick lunch and more than half of the conversation was about food that was surprisingly delicious for a big brand like this. The staff was very attentive and supremely knowledgable. If you are not sure about what to order from the menu i would recommend asking staff for recommendation.   We started off with Truffled potato chips that was dressed with point reyes blue cheese sauce and the  Big-eye tuna tartare finished with avocado, spicy mayo along with a side of sesame wonton. Both were spot on!! Perfectly cooked and presented.  For the main entree i ordered the Sauteed seabass with sides of gulf shrimp, caramelized sunchokes in a tomato-saffron broth. Close to mediterranean style and no words to describe this. Highly recommended. I would also recommend the Half jidori chicken cooked in yukon potato puree and finished with rosemary jus and parsley.  If you are looking for a best place to eat while at MGM then look no further.",

It seems Wolfgang's  restaurants can be counted on for quality - it has not decreased as time goes by.  We stopped in for a quick bite at this location in MGM Grand before a hockey game at T-Mobile Area.  Had a simple meal of shrimp pesto pizza and a Caesar salad.  Both were delicious!  The shrimp served on the pizza were big and fresh. The Caesar salad was well executed with baby romaine lettuce and was not over-dressed.  Also tried the barrel-aged bourbon in a classic Manhattan cocktail - very good to say the least. Service was quick and friendly.",

Got here at 1 a.m. Yes. 1 a.m. As this is one of the few restaurants open late that aren't fast food. The place was almost a ghost town so our seat to eat time was quick!  They close at 6 a.m.  I ordered the spicy wings which were the highlight of the night. They weren't overly spicy but just a hint of kick. The fried calamari was the loser of the night. Not terrible but not as crispy as I felt it should've been. The 3 cheese Mac n cheese was my Neutral dish of the night. It wasn't great but it was really good if that makes sense. Tasted just a bit too plain for me though. Let me say again, All food was good though.   All and all I experienced great service and \"good\" food so I will definitely be back.",

A basic one sided straight to the point menu is all you need to taste his latest bar and grill style treats. Lemon cheesecake was my first choice to start off my journey.After my first bite I wasn't impressed but it came with blueberry thyme compote which it needed to complete the dessert,now we're taking. Next I ordered the Duck Bratwurst,not the greatest  presentation but its bratwurst on a plate.So,the plate came with potato puree,caramelized cabbage, apples and confit bacon.If you have ever seen the movie \"Mirror has two faces\" I was about to do the same.Putting each one of these flavors on the fork and tasting it,now I knew what he was going for.  The hostess was stoned faced grumpy and our server was okay because she was nowhere to be found on several occasions but knowledgeable.One  thing I forgot to mention was that they now make their pasta in house.Reservation are not required but recommend after 5 and that's my take,Peace",

Honestly, I have tried their seafood pasta and three different types of pizza and the food was no better than OK. The pasta was fine but nothing special and for the price they charge for it, I can cook much better myself. The pizzas, especially the vegetarian one was too salty and taste wise, it missed more of tomato (sauce) flavor which is the base of any pizza!   I do think that for the quality of the food this place is a bit overpriced, so I guess if you are dying of hunger and you find yourself in MGM in urgent need to eat, go for it, but if you can wait few minutes, go elsewhere.   I would not come here again for the food for sure. However, the beer selection was decent and I have to say that the service was very nice and attentive.",

The place was simple chic. Wait staff extremely friendly and very very attentive. Tea left filled constantly. Really a GREAT experience.

Tried the crab cakes (tiny pieces, comes in 4) that were tasty. But for ~$20, I really cringe. I know, I know, it's Vegas.  The seafood pasta ~$25 was really good too, the sauce tasted light and authentic, there was plenty of seafood. Split between two, each person gets a super light/lunch portion. But it was perfect for us post-KA.  Between two people, one appetizer and one entree plus two drinks ran about $75.",

Chef Wolfgang Puck's menus are a wonderful expression of his unique style yet tailored to each of his restaurants. Plus some signature dishes that are throwbacks to his past restaurants. The pasta dishes were enjoyed. As others have mentioned, the portion sizing of the gnocchi was a bit underwhelming. Exceptional flavor and perfectly executed gnocchi... but noticeably smaller than any other dish on the table. The rigatoni was al dente and well sauced. Great sausage flavors. The two \"winning dishes\" at our table were the hamburger and the Chinese chicken salad. The burger... perfectly cooked to order, a delicious onion jam as one of the toppings, and really nice buns. The salad... it's not just \"the original \" but clearly the best rendition of a Chinese chicken salad e-v-e-r!  Fresh, well balanced, full of variety for a taste sensation in each bite... and a deliciously mild yet flavorful dressing. All of this plus great service... it's hard to beat this experience!",

About 5 minutes later, a waiter came up and asked if we've been helped. He placed us at a table right away. The waitress took our food and drinks order together as we were in a bit of a hurry. Got water while we waited. Waited 10 minites for our other drinks we ordered so we looked around curious.. our drinks were sitting on the back bar waiting to be served. Our waitress seemed to be just wondering around. She must've been day dreaming. 4 more minutes later she brought the drinks over. Got our food in a timely matter, but never refilled our water. We had to get the attemtion of another waiter. I ordered the chicken salad sandwhich and it was delicious. ..until I almost choked on a 2 inch long chicken bone. Not trying to get anyome fired but in my first experience here, it was not worth the $$$.",

There crab cakes are amazing, they have a green tarter sauce thats so sweet and tangy at the same time.  We ordered the sausage italian pizza and clam pasta.  Both were delicious except the pizza was a little too oily for my taste.  The pasta was so good, next time when I come back in August I will be ordering the pasta.  They also had a special dessert that day which was vanilla ice cream with pineapples, apples and pie crust.  The dessert was to die for, I usually don't like pies but this was good. Can't wait to go back to vegas again this summer and go back to wolfgang puck.",

    "text": "This was easily the worst meal of our trip.  Decided to come here since it was around ten at night and most other places were closing up, figured it couldn't be that bad since they were busy and its a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, right?   Wrong. Started out with their wings and a \"Caesar Salad.\"  Wings were bland, the dressing that came with them even more so.  To their credit, they tell you the Caesar isn't a proper Caesar salad, but once again, completely bland, cheese not good, disappointing. Not as bad as the Entrees though.  I had the Ricotta Gnocchi with fennel Bolognese.  The Gnocchi themselves were mush, bland, and the sauce definitely did not taste fresh at all.  My brothers Linguini with Clams went basically untouched, and honestly, we're not picky eaters, at all, and it was ten at night in Vegas so of course we'd been drinking.   We told the server we didn't really enjoy the food, and he didn't seem too surprised.   He offered to take something off, but we declined, and just got out of there. With the quantity they do at this restaurant, it seems like the quality has been sacrificed and its all been streamlined.   We'd considered eating at Bouchon that night, and with prices that were pretty comparable we definitely made a mistake.   Extra star for service, but the food is one star at best.",

My last visit changed that view. I ordered liver and was served a horrendous piece of meat after a very long wait that was overcooked. After sending it back I was sent another veined piece of undercooked meat. The manager could not figure out what to do. The place is run by a crew of untrained teen agers or so it seemed. I wrote to Puck and was never favored with an answer. Stay away.",

I was told that the burger served here was the best around, and being that half of the solid food i eat happens to be hamburger, i couldn't pass it up.  The atmosphere was great, open air to the casino but also secluded enough. The multicolored glass panels created for me a very relaxed feeling, always a benefit when enjoying good food.  Or was it thebeer. I dunno, plus one for having good micro brews!  Let me just preface the review of the food with one sentence. The service rocked. Our waiter was polite, attentive, and on point. Even when he was away attending other parties another, equally skilled, waiter was there to make sure we were attended to.   Now to the food. In an attempt to show how classy i can be, even at lunch on a Monday, i ordered the tuna tartar with crispy wantons. It came in a cylindrical presentation with a layer of fresh avocado on top. Just next to it was a streak of red sauce, the base of which had to be Sriracha or some similar red chili sauce.  This is probably the third or forth time i have had tartar, and it went down well. The tuna was tasty and had a nice soft texture. It went well with the avocado.   If you love burgers, this one will make you see god. It was perfectly cooked, moist and de-licious. It came with fresh pickled cucumbers, butter lettuce, and a sweet onion marmalade. I will be buried with a bottle of ketchup right next to me, but on this burger, it wasn't necessary. All the elements included worked together, unlike most time i eat a burger where half the stuff wilts next to my french fries. Which were also good, never doubt a Frenchmen's restaurants ability to bring the frites.   Go there, eat a burger, smile.",

    "text": "I was not impressed with this restaurant when we first arrived, but after eating the food I changed my mind.    First, the restaurant is right in the middle of the casino floor, surrounded by noisy games.  It has 3/4 height glass walls, so there is even less separation from the casino.  Also, the interior is sterile and white, like Martha Stewart designed a school cafeteria.    We had to wait on the casino floor to be seated because the restaurant has no entry or waiting area.  There are just 3 steps up from the casino to the hostess stand.  At first we thought we were in line to talk to the hostess, but soon we realized the people in front of us were just waiting.  Pushing past them, we finally got our name on the list, and the hostess told us to go stand at the bottom of the stairs with the other people blocking the entrance.  It was a really inefficient system.  Now I'm done complaining.  Once we were seated it was a really pleasant meal.  The surrounding casino didn't bother us at all.  The waiter was attentive.  We enjoyed the wine we ordered.  The pizza I ate was good, and the gnocchi with sausage sauce my husband ordered was wonderful.    To qualify that statement, you need to know that I was a vegetarian for 9 years and I still don't eat red meat.  I even make my husband cook chili with ground turkey instead of beef.  But the next time we eat here, I am ordering the sausage gnocchi.  It was that good.",

I have to say the chicken was very good and exceeded expectations.  It had a crust on the outside and very tender and juicy on the inside.  The gnochi had lots of flavor and good texture.  For lunch I think we dropped 80$ with three drinks included so not terribly bad.  It is worth a visit for sure.  I was tempted to try the 17$ hamburger but it looked so huge that I would have to split it with my wife and she was not in the mood for a burger....all in all a very nice dining experience.",

This restaurant was situated right across the casino from the KA theater so it was perfect. The portions were actually quite a bit larger than I expected for an upper scale restaurant. We all ordered appetizers, drinks, entrees and 1 dessert. The total bill came to $200, which I consider a bargain. We all enjoyed our food. We had crab cakes, veal ravioli, rib eye, salmon, chinois chicken salad, and calamari. Everything was delicious, although the veal ravioli was not seasoned enough for my taste. The rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The pineapple mojito was a sweet new treat. Our waiter was very cordial and was great at making suggestions. All in all we loved the place. We sat at a table right next to the edge of the open casino and had no problem hearing or otherwise. I will definitely return to eat here!",

However, the sevice was subpar at best, not something I would expect from a place like this.  The bartender ( a cute female) took my order, refilled my tea (after asking me what it was - I guess with a whole 6 people at the bar, its hard to remember what everyone is drinking), and that was the only interaction the entire hour I was there.  Not once did anyone check on me to ask how the food was or if I needed anything.  I know this sounds critical, but when you are paying $25 for a pizza at lunch, I dont think its too much to ask if everything is good and if I needed anything.  Some parmesean cheese would have been nice, but hey, I ate the pizza anyway.  Bottom line, sit at a table if you are eating here, for it looked like ths servers were very attentive.",

Well, we started off with a manhattan and mojito.  The manhattan was absolutely delicious.  Our app of choice was the blue cheese truffle chips...divine!  Perfectly cooked chips with large chunks of quality blue cheese and a drizzling of truffle oil.  For our entrees I decided on the wild mushroom agnolotti, made up of peas, caramelized shallots and parmesan.  My guy went with the double cut pork chop, polenta cake, caramelized brussel sprouts with a maple-mustard glaze.  Wow, I had a bite of the pork chop and it is the best I have tasted, ever.  They cook it in a charcoal burning grill and the flavor is outstanding.  My dish was great, but that pork chop dish gave me serious food envy.  Everything on it was outstanding.  I dream about it.

    "text": "after the long drive and late arrival to the hotel, our party was ridiculously hungry for some real food. because we were also lazy, i decided to look up a decent/ reasonable place to fill our grumbling tummies and found this place.  it was conveniently located within the hotel that we stayed at... and open late.  score!  the food was not too bad.  we tried a few of their pizzas and burgers and while they weren't out of this world awesome, they weren't too shabby either.  i think another yelper summed this place up nicely by saying that it was 'unmemorable'.  there was nothing about this place other than the pretty walls/ decor that was particularly worth taking note.  the restaurant is also conveniently located across cirque du soleil's ka- which unfortunately meant that it's also right next to the casino area, so the smell of smoke kind of permeated through and annoyed me. all in all, this is just somewhere you go to fill up on simple, hearty fare late at night. not someplace you should go out of your way to try- but if you're already there and hungry, why not?",

If you're staying somewhere in this giant hotel-casino, consider Wolfgang Puck for all your late-night dining needs. The pizzas are a bargain and were so tasty! I think that during a long weekend, my roommates and I tried at least three or four types and enjoyed them all. The drinks looked very expensive, but if you're eating at 3 am, you're probably not continuing to drink even more, right? Breakfast items were also pretty good -- I think we had eggs benedict. Mmm!",

We ordered, the calamari and truffled potato chips and both are Hella good! Then I saw this beautiful pasta dishes. I remember my husband got the pasta with clams and mussels I tasted it too and I love it. I ordered the ravioli with pancetta green peas... I love it too...and for the dessert we tried this lemon bar cake that is tangy and not too sweet... It is quite good. Wolfgang knows what he's doin for sure. He has some more resto in Caesars palace and next time Im goin to try them when I get back to Vegas... What I like with it is the fair prices...  Wolfgang pucks creations in a good price....",

Followed by our wonderful server who was very knowledgeable about the menu items and very helpful by suggesting some of her favorite items. The bus staff was also amazing -- I never seemed to be able to have anything other than a full water glass, and used dishes were promptly removed.  At first glance this restaurant seems a bit pricey, but if you realize its a big name restaurant and its in a strip casino, prices aren't out of line. We enjoyed our food, cocktails, and loved the delicious dessert. I will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "This is probably my biggest disappointment in service and food of my whole trip. I ordered clam linguini and had shrimp fettuccini delivered. When we told the server, she was apologetic and explained they were out of clams so they gave me shrimp. She explained she should have asked but went for it.  Mistake #1. Your server should already know if you're out of product.   Mistake #2. If you didn't have what I ordered, I should have been asked to order again. It is so strange that your server didn't ask or communicate the issue.  When I ordered the clams, the server asked if she could bring some garlic bread. Sure, I said. When my check came, there was a charge for $8.   Mistake #3. The communication was misleading. My table already had a pizza. I didn't need to purchase garlic bread. From the way it was communicated, I believed it came with my non-existent linguini.  The server acted like she didn't want me to order anything else, and just took the plate away. I asked for a spaghetti and meatballs. While my husband finished his food, I waited for my spaghetti. The food itself was okay, the sauce was a little acidic and didn't have the large plum tomatoes described on the menu. Honestly it tasted like canned ravioli with basil mixed in.  Our server dropped a beer on the ground right in front of us. Accidents happen, but this didn't really help the rest of the issues.   When the check came, I was charged for both the clams and the spaghetti. We waited another several minutes for the server to remove the linguini.   She came back with the ticket.... and the item STILL hadn't been removed. At this point we were extremely frustrated, we were late for our next event. We had to wait 15 mins for the whole ticket fiasco to get sorted.  Check arrives.. and I'm surprised to see the spaghetti at full price on my ticket. After making us wait and failing to confirm my order, and upcharging me on bread--- I didn't have any compensation for my time.   Mistake #4 Failing to value your customer's time is poor business practices. What ever manager was on duty at the time should be fired. This night was pure chaos.   My husband gave the server his credit card and suddenly she dropped to the floor in a panic. She just realized she had lost another customer's card! She was running around and crouching on the floor with our card as she searched for the other customers. What.. is going on with this restaurant? What a nightmare!   I would not recommend this place based on this experience.",

This double cut pork chop I had the pleasure of eating was the absolute best pork chop I've ever eaten and a True game changer. In my opinion (partial to being a pork lover vs. Beef) this particular chop blows any steak out of the water.  Its cooked to perfection. It's like an inch or so thick, perfectly tender, seasoned to tantalize and savory to soothe the soul. Highly recommend trying this exceptional piece of meat, I couldn't even finish the other sides and my mouth is watering all over again now craving this very expensive but very worth it pork chop. Bravo on nailing everything a pork chop should be, I'm a fan for life!!!",

The crab cakes tasted good but there wasn't that much chunks of crab and even though there was four of them the size was tiny. The entree was a good size though, got the prime rib French dip. The chocolate souffle was my favorite out of what we ordered! Overall I think if you keep mainly to the entrees and dessert it's a good place to eat at",

    "text": "This was my first time going to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant and I had lofty expectations, which honestly weren't met. Compared to a few other places, the prices for the food weren't outrageous so that was a plus. I went with my mom who ordered steak skewers and a house salad, I got the spaghetti and meatballs and chose to order a bread plate for $5. My mom's steak skewers were okay, nothing special to me but she enjoyed them, so that's all that matters. The bread was just okay. I mean, sure it's plain bread with butter but something was lacking. What was most disappointing were the meatballs in the spaghetti. No flavor at all and my mom told me they tasted like they were frozen. All I know is they were big but tasted like nothing. The spaghetti sauce also was lacking in flavor. Some garlic or something was needed. In other words, I've made better spaghetti with sauce from the local grocery store. To top it off, our waitress was very inattentive once we got our food. She only asked us how our food was once and then we had to wait forever for her to come back so we get the check. Then we had wait even longer for her to actually bring the check. It was all right, but I wouldn't return. Food needs more flavor, it was very bland. Oh, and I had a bit of a minor stomach upset for about two days after. Nothing major, but the next day, I felt nauseous and hadn't eaten anything since dinner at this restaurant the previous night.",

    "text": "You know the restaurants you see in airports? The ones that seem like a refuge of comfort when you're hungry, but you know in your heart they're just not all that great? Sometimes they're really pleasant appearing, but undoubtedly you still become aware of the fact that you're in an airport.   That's how I feel about Wolfgang Puck. It would not have been my choice for a last dinner in Vegas, but after a great, albeit long, concert at the MGM garden arena, I was going to take the nearest restaurant available out of sheer exhaustion.   The menu covers the basics of what you'd expect a bar and grill type to serve; pizzas, pastas, burgers, salads, etc. Extensive alcohol nonetheless, but where in Vegas is that not automatically assumed?  I had a really hard time deciding what to rate this restaurant. The food was pretty good, I'll be the first to admit. I had spaghetti and meatballs, and those balls were fire. Very light, but exceptional flavorful.   But this just doesn't cut it for Vegas. When I'm here I want something that's gonna make my eyes pop out of my skull. Something over the top, that elicits those uncontrollable sounds one makes in the throws of (food) passion. Not something that's pretty good, with a large price tag slapped on due to name and location. I've been to taco trucks on the side of the road with more excitement.   I don't know, I guess this is partially my fault. I should have known better, should have maybe looked harder. I guess the whole establishment just struck me as boring. There's nothing inherently wrong with it by any means, I just think for the price point, you have a plethora of better options at your finger tips. Seems like most people enjoyed their meal here, so take from this what you will.",

They have dedicated water servers so we always had water and plates were cleared promptly! So why the 1-star hit? The atmosphere! They call it a Bar & Grill so maybe I should have expected noisy with crammed and just ok seating. However, the prices led me to think up-scale dining....$40-50 for a steak dinner.  I had something more like Bavette's in my mind's eye.",

His award-winning manner and level of service sets the bar so high, other servers cannot even see it without a telescope. If you're lucky enough to be looked after by both Reiko & Christian then this as a good as it is ever gonna get for you at any restaurant. I've been to nicer, pricier places with so much more fanfare and prestige but I have not received service comparable at these other \"notable\" dining establishments...the service at Wolfgang Puck tops em all. On a recent stay at the MGM Grand we ate there twice a day...no need to go anywhere else. The manager hires quite well and both the front & back staff perform their duties in superb fashion. Try the filet mignon, it's hard to get a truly rare steak anywhere, they got mine right...all four of them. Nice assortment on the menu, full bar...everything you need but what sets this place above the others is the service. Not too much, not too little and always with a personal feel that appears sincere. Reiko must love his job...he got everything right every time. Complete attention to detail with a sly wit and contagious smile. My wife and I are demanding consumers who work in the food service industry so if we're 100% satisfied then everyone else will be a million percent satisfied. Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill...don't leave the MGM without hitting it. You can thank me later.",

Sausage on the pizza was not seasoned well and not enough cheese. I wanted a coffee and was informed the coffee machine was down - your coffee machine broke and you didn't either fix it or find a replacement before daily open at 11:30am? That's just poor management. We got a margarita pizza to go, opened the takeout box and revealed two leaves of basil...had to send it back and ask for more basil to be added to the not-so-margarita margarita pizza.  Take you $$ somewhere else for a better value meal. You have too many good options in Vegas to be spending it on mediocracy.",

My friend insisted that we tried the truffle potato chips from the rave reviews she got from yelp, so we did. Extremely underwhelming... It was not even hot. The chips didn't feel super crispy. We felt as if they had this sitting for a while, ready, possibly from a previous mistake. Very salty. We had to ask for jalepenos and tabasco sauce to break up the taste of the sauce. It was just Bleh...  You get a free bread basket. Oh my goodness.. The bread was amazing.. I didn't want to eat it since the chips were bad enough but I could not help myself. We even asked for more to take back to our room hahaha.   We also ordered the steak skewers. You get 5 pieces of steak. This was really good and well cooked! It was on a bed of cole slaw, also good.   Would I come back? Yes. They seem to have a lot of items and we didn't get to try a lot of things too. Maybe my rating will increase after trying different items.",

Our group of eight was lucky enough to get a table right away at 6:30pm for a mid-week dinner. After that it started to get real busy.   5 stars - Focaccia topped with caramelized onions. Complimentary. This was the highlight of the bread basket that everyone was clamoring over. The focaccia was savory, soft, warm, and really got us all hungry for dinner.   4 stars - Vegetable Pizza. Oven Roasted Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Mozzarella, and Nicoise Olives. My favorite kind of pizza is always one that starts with a base of pesto and cheese. This one hit the spot. I liked the thin crust that had just enough veggies to not weigh down the pizza or make it soggy.  4 stars - Spaghetti. Plum Tomatoes, Garlic, Sweet Basil, and Pecorino Romano. Thank you for getting the pasta right. It was cooked to a perfect al dente with a nice chew to the spaghetti. The marinara sauce was a good balance of sweet tomato and savory garlic and Romano cheese. I liked every twirl of spaghetti with this dish. Very good.  Our table got a few desserts to share. The chocolate souffle was the favorite, served with a scoop of ice cream and chocolate sauce. Second were the beignets served with a berry jam. These were bite sized and light. Last were the half dozen chocolate chip cookies. Nothing much to rave about there.   Overall, this is an ideal option for groups with a lot of menu options for everyone to have a great meal.",

Ordered the half chicken entree, it was delicious but hard to finish. Everyone seemed to enjoy their entrees and our server did a great job keeping an eye on us and making recommendations. Would definitely go back.",

I got a burger and fries. The burger was delicious very good qualoty meat. The fries were okay. I got a margarita which was $14 and it was the smallest margarita ever! I like ranch for my fries and the ranch was not good. I personally did not care for the atmosphere. I felt it was overpriced and wish I had gone somewhere else. Service was good, but slow.",

We were on the fence about sitting down for a late meal but they playfully assured us we would love it.  Our server was exceptional.  For a place as beautiful, yet casual as this is, the service was as good as I've ever had in any restaurant of any caliber.  He knew exactly when to recommend things, his timing of stopping at the table was perfectly paced, we were not rushed nor did we ever find ourselves needing anything thanks in part to the great food runners and bussers who kept waters full and the table clear.    The food was what you should expect from a big name on the Vegas Strip.  The Jidori Chicken Skewers were exceptional.  The truffled chips with blue cheese sauce were fun to share and the house made gnocchi......my gosh was it special.  Finished it off with the ice cream sandwich which was Nutella ice cream between a brownie top and bottom...accented with caramelized bananas and candied hazelnut.  Phenomenal.  Add it to the list of incredible dining establishments in Vegas and at the very top for late night options.",

And with Wolfgang Puck's name all over vegas, I was really apprehensive of coming here. In this case, Wolfgang Puck came through. With a more casual and wide open atmosphere I've really enjoyed my lunch experiences here. Located inside Mandalay Bay, you need to follow the maze towards the back near the Ka entrance. This last instance I had the prime rib dip sandwich and it came with some crispy onion rings. The roll was solid enough so it didn't fall apart when I dipped it in the thicker than expected au ju. The dip part coated the sandwich and was not too salty and went well with the horseradish sauce that had a good enough kick but not overpowering. My wife and father-in-law had the fried chicken sandwich that a lot of other patrons were ordering and it was stacked with a generous piece of fried chicken, pickles, and some kind of orange sauce that was good and made up for the chicken that was a little dry with a side of sweet potato fries. My mother-in-law had the margarehta pizza which looked average. But we were well taken care of, and the good was brought out quickly.  We will always make a point to come back here for another lunch go around.",

The food didn't take long to come out either.   We weren't too hungry so we ordered a few things to share. Pretty much every review I saw they got the truffled potato chips so I had to try them and they were delicious! Crispy chips with an amazing truffle cheese sauce and the blue cheese just added that extra salty tangy flavor to it.   We ordered the prosciutto pizza and it was really good. My favorite part of it was actually the arugula on top since it cut the richness of all the cheese and added a freshness to the pizza. We also got two of the pastas to share; the rigatoni and spaghetti & meatballs. Both were excellent and very flavorful, I liked the spaghetti more.   To end our meal we shared the chocolate souffle. I was hesitant on if I should get it or not at first since I was extremely full but I'm so glad I chose to. It was one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had. It had a nice crunchy top with a nice fluffy and rich inside. It also came with a caramel ice cream which went really well with the souffle. Eating them together is the way to go not separately.   Overall an amazing experience and I'll definitely be back if I'm at the MGM Grand.",

On our last night in Vegas, we couldn't figure out where to eat and when we walked by here we knew we had to eat here. My sister checked out the menu outside before confirming my pick.   We were seated inside which was good because I had zero desire to sit outside because it was too noisy.  Our server was nice. I didn't catch his name, but it was the Asian guy who was a little short. He was suggesting what we should order so we went with his recommendations.  I got the Caesar salad because that's my favorite.My sister got the Baby Iceberg salad and my other sister got the Prosciutto pizza. We also shared a pasta plate, but I can't remember the name of the dish. Before that, we started off with the calamari for appetizer. It was delicious.  We still had a bit of room for dessert so we ordered a couple things. First was the Warm Vanilla Beignets which comes with an order of 6. We also got the Chocolate Souffle because we figured why the hell not.I LOVE LOVE LOVE the beignet. I almost died. It has my favorite thing inside..........NUTELLA. They won my heart with that one. The souffle was good, but the shock of the nutella wouldn't escape me.  It was such a great meal. We went up to our room right after to nurse our food baby.  I don't remember them, but I'm sure I had great dreams that night.",

The thing that kills me about this place is that they charge you for drink refills and they don't tell you about it. They keep asking you if you want more ice tea only for you to realize at the end when you get the bill that these cheap bastards don't give you free refills. The rule here is water only. I ended up paying the most I ever paid to eat by myself and the food wasn't even that good. Your server barely does any work as it's a team that does it all. All in all this was a disappointment but was the only place I could go in a rainstorm in Vegas. I've been coming to MGM for 10 years and it's a damn shame what happened to this Wolf Gang Puck's restaurant. Eat elsewhere and if you do come here don't forget they charge up the ass for drinks.",

We were starved and need food STAT. Wolfgang Puck actually had a bar with a couple of TVs that were playing the football games. NICE!  We were promptly seated at a table with a great view of the game. We were greeted immediately by our server and were offered the specials and a run through of the menu.   We ordered a steak sandwich ($22), the Spaghettini ($20) and a draft Firestone Pale 31 to share ($8). The steak sandwich was flavorful and had a side of fries. The Spaghettini was simple and fresh. It could have used a little more salt or cheese, but otherwise very filling and loved the flavors.  Great option to have a nice meal in MGM.",

This place had well rounded and balanced menus for both kids and adults. I loved the potato chips, and bacon blue cheese burger. I will say that we had one issues with a bar tender who was very rude, but the manager Brad was over the top accommodating. Not only was he receptive, but he immediately took care of it. He asked me to please come and dine again, and we did. He made up for the rude bartender and truly made the Wolfgang brand proud. We will now be seeking out Wolfgang restaurants any time we r in Vegas. Thanks Brad!!",

Appetizers were decent.  Tuna tartar was a bit weird having sweet soy on too to create a syrupy mouthfeel.  Calamari was calamari, nothing special.  Crab cakes were actually quite good.   I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs because how can you go bad with a classic right? Pasta was cooked well, but the meatballs were just salty balls.   Friend of mine got the Rigatoni which was also salty.   Is the chef tasting the food before sending it out?  Our server was terrible and not attentive at all and the busser/backwaiter was more helpful and attentive. (Didn't catch his name, but is a local and the first time he gambled he said he won $300. Hope you read this) We were never asked if any of the dishes were ok. Had to wait about 15 minutes  until the backwaiter asked if we were all done and wanted the check. When the server drops the check he doesn't even say a word. No greeting when leaving from any of the staff other than who? Another backwaiter!!  Manager that was wearing a bright red shirt doesn't care about anything except texting and using his phone on the floor. Doesn't table touch any of the tables nor have any idea of what is going on in the restaurant. He almost greeted us on the way out, but looked at us and continued to lean on the counter and continue his conversation with the hostess. Nice!!!  Overpriced and service sucks for what it is. Sorry for the negative post, but I want my hour and a half of my life back..",

We ended up getting a bunch of appetizers, sides and pizzas which were all well made and delicious, and reasonably priced. So in the end it worked out.   Drinks were on the excessive side in price, averaging around $14 - more than several of our reasonably priced meal items.

I had a blackberry cocktail it was strong and good.  My entree was a sausage pizza variation.  The sausage looked like salami.  I've never had sausage look like that and I've been to high end Italian places before.  Food was good, but over priced.   $80 for a small pizza, one drink, one soda, lasagna and appetizer.   I wouldn't return to pay that much again.   Food was brought out quickly and wait staff was attentive.",

I had the gnocchi and that was delicious. The staff is very attentive and it is very comfortable here. Do not miss out you will love it here.",

The half chinois salad I had as an accompaniment was very good, but considering the size of the half portion, it's a good thing I didn't get the regular, as it was huge.   One attractive feature about the restaurant was they have a decent sized gluten-free menu for those that must adhere to that diet. One thing I would like to added as a designation to the menu are those items that are dairy-free as it seems increasingly people that have one form of food allergy typically will have others as well.   Overall a very enjoyable experience and I would definitely go back again and recommend it to friends.",

It is located in the lobby of the MGM Casino. You are in the middle of the casino when dining here, so be prepared for the same smoke odor you get at the poker tables. This place is not known for breakfast food but here we are at the cusp of lunch, which is also when they open for the day. The best way to fight a hangover, oily food. A mistake, really, for this place at least.  -=-Reuben-=- Not the greatest Reuben. It's a bit expensive for what you get. Rye is not the tastiest bread, but coupled with the tasteless meat cut of the corn beef and the overly spread mayonnaise, it's not gonna be good eatin for today. It was super oily for what it was. I probably wouldn't dine here again, but that famous name of familiarity will attract customers again and again.",

We ordered the chili chicken wings, which was quite tasty, but my boyfriend bit into one of them and discovered it still raw. We told the server about this, and instead of just giving us a different wing or even apologize, he took it and disappeared in the back. He came back later only to tell us that it wasn't raw, and that the pinkish color was from the brine. Funny, the rest of the wings weren't pink, so what makes this one so special? Oh maybe because it was raw! Of course, my boyfriend spent the rest of the night throwing up in the bathroom.  Needless to say, we will never come back here. For one thing, they serve raw chicken to their customers, and two, they felt the need to argue with us when we reported this problem to them.",

The burger is huge and comes with some of the best fries I have ever had. I tried their sangria once and it was ok.  The last time I went, i also noticed they had a pre fixe menu.

THE ORDER:  Butter Lettuce \"Caesar-style\" Salad, with croutons and whole white anchovy: 4.5 stars.....really good, but not perfect.  Chopped Vegetable Salad: AMAZING!!!! 5 stars...the BEST salad I have ever had....the textures and flavors were amazing! I'd never had SHAVED feta before this salad, and it gives you a complete different exeprience with the cheese....The variety of goodies in this salad is out of this world. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT!  Spicy Tuna Tartare with Avocado, Cucumber, and Wontons: 4 stars.....really good and fresh...could have used more spice (heat). The cucumber was chopped and mixed into the avocado, which contrasted the ceaminess of the avo, with a nice, bright crunch.  Maine Crab Cakes with Tomato Relish and Basil Aoili: 4.5 stars....the crab  meat itself was excellent.....the tomato on top was amazing....i wish there was more sauce because it was sooo good!  THE SERVICE: 5 stars..... I won't bore you with the details, but the service was AMAZING!!!!!!! yes.... AMAZING!  I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK....it was a bit pricey, but you pay for quality....everything was so fresh and yummy!  xo- andrea",

A friend and I sat at the bar and shared 2 appetizers.  I originally thought we would get 3 but the first 2 were plenty of food.  The Crispy Fried Calamari with cucumber slaw was excellent.  The calamari was so tender and the breading was light.  I don't remember many details on the slaw that was with it because it was pretty bland.  Didn't matter to me though since the calamari was so good.  We also ordered the Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers.  The steak was melt in your mouth good! I'm not a big fan of any type of sauce on steaks, but the house steak sauce complimented the meat!  There were 6-7 skewers on the place and the meat was a few bites per skewer.  I wish we could have gone back for a full meal, but I will certainly head back there the next time I am in Vegas.  I had this place in mind for a late night snack because they are open until 6am, but we never made it.",

The pizzas are awesome - great crust, fresh flavors, and a good size. The salads are good too, except the chopped vegetable salad which had flavors (primarily the overwhelming pickled something gross) that did not work for me at all. The menu description made it sounds like a cheese/cream salad, and instead it was very dry with a strange combination of vegetables - asparagus, pickled onions, pickled something green that was so salty it hurt. I don't recall tasting feta or creamy garlic at all. The other salads at my table (green, chinese chicken) looked amazing though. Can't go wrong with the pizza margerita. The cocktails are very good here too, with fresh fruit ingredients and a strong pour. I really liked the banana cheesecake.",

The service and the food quality here is top notch, and the decor is cool, with colorful decorated glass slabs separating the dining area. Seeing as it is just as reasonably priced for lunch as the $20/person buffet and the creepy diner looking Studio Cafe, I choose this any day. I'd prefer quality over quantity.  Off the bat, the coffee is incredible. Just what you need to counteract all those vicious cocktails from days prior.   The butter lettuce ceasar was fabulous with the aged foghorn bleu cheese, and we asked them to go easy on the dressing. It was still lively and flavorful while being light and delicate.   The mushroom omelette, pretty good. Not the most incredible omelette I've tasted but it was up to snuff. Needed salt and hot sauce. The potatoes that come with it, however, were ridiculously amazing. Perfect crispy outer texture, lightly peppery, hot and soft inside. Soo good!!!",

    "text": "When someone in our group suggested a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, I was worried that it would cost an arm and a leg. But on the website, it said the average tab per person is $31 to $50. That didn't sound too crazy, so I said OK.  We had a group of about 12 and made a reservation in advance. Our table was ready to go when we got there. It's a beautiful restaurant. Lots of warm reds and yellows. Low lighting. Very intimate.   My husband and I split a bottle of the house Cabernet, which was good. Then for an appetizer, we got the bruschetta with heirloom tomatoes. It was great! So fresh. Highly recommend!  For an entree, I ordered the Grilled Pacific Salmon with bacon, potatoes, baby vegetables and some kind of mustard sauce. Wow! Such great flavor! There was not a morsel of food left on my plate. Not a morsel! My husband had the Organic Chicken, and he said that was good too.   The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. Even the bus boy was great with taking away plates.   I had a really good experience here, and I felt like the food was priced right and was a good value. Check it out if you happen to be near the MGM.",

And it did not taste good. The chicken drumettes had almost no meat. Blech. The tuna tartare was nice enough but lacked zing.  Yawn.  The truffle and bleu cheese potato chips tasted good but they also tasted confused.  Choose one intense flavor to focus on, but not both.  I am giving them 3 stars because we got great service and our bartender was both a gentleman and patient with our drunken hazing.  I will got there again because it is convenient, but not because I like the food.",

There were 4 of us in our party - all different tastes and one vegetarian.  Menu easily accommodated us all. We ordered appetizers and meals and did a bit of a table share -- everything was off the scale.  Highlights were the Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers, Chinois Chicken Salad,  Rigatoni with Sweet Fennel Sausage Bolognese, and of course the pizza!!  We are a particular bunch and frequent all the top chef locations - - this is a repeat to our list and a must do when in Vegas!  Love Wolfgang Puck food and style.  Have to say I recently bought the Puck Oven and put some of his recipes to the test in his oven - made delish meals in a flash!!  Thanks WP!",

I LOVE crab cakes! and boy do they do it RIGHT. it's not your usual crab cake with tartar sauce. oh no. it's 4 lightly crumbed/fried wondercakes set atop a delicious pesto sauce and topped with a juicy tomato salsa and watercress. what a wonderful twist!  _all other entrees (salmon, chicken, steak)_ delicious. each with their own unique and well complemented sauces.   _pizza_  Love the crust. freshly toasted from their oven behind the bar. toppings are fresh but it didnt have that stringy cheese that I like =[  _Chocolate Souffle_ OH YUM. =D it comes in a huge ramekin and baked to perfection. puffy top. soft and steamy cake layer enveloping the melty steamy gooey inside. served with a side of vanilla bean ice cream. AMAZING =D Better than Roy's Hawaiian Fusion. but a step behind Nobhill's banana souffle!  we also got a fruit plate and when we ran out of ice cream. we used the souffle as a thick and luscious fondue for the strawberries and bananas =]",

I ordered an Old Fashioned cocktail, although at first I had a hard time bringing myself to spend $20 for 1 Old Fashioned but once I broke down I would consider it to be the most worth while high end cocktail I have ever had, in fact so worth while I ordered a second. It was made table side right out of the cask, and might I add was the most smooth bourbon I have ever had. I sat through the whole meal and was offered small amounts of their orders. The entire meal of what I tasted was astounding and the service was of the highest quality. It is a perfect restaurant to get a high end meal for occasions such as anniversaries, birthdays, wedding dinners, or just a nice date where you want to impress. I give it a 10/10 and I will be going back",

First night in Vegas and I didn't want fast food, but wasn't prepared to drop a few hundred on two bites of fish and some kitschy gourmet fries, either.  Searching Yelp... Wolfgang seemed like a fair balance between the two.  Four of us made our way down to MGM to have a nice dinner and were certainly not disappointed.  Our orders ranged from the spicy tuna tartare, to two different types of pizza, to the organic grilled chicken.  Everything was super savory and delicious.  Service was wonderful - our waitress was very informative and shared details about her favorites on the menu and even took some time to stop and talk to us about some of the workings of the famous restaurants/chefs in the area.  Her friendliness was much appreciated and definitely helped contribute to a great experience.  The friends we were with had been once before and indicated their first visit wasn't very memorable - but after this trip, had changed their minds.  The food was fantastic.  The service matched.  I'm pretty sure I could order anything on this menu and be totally satisfied... but that tuna tartare - was one of the best dinners I could've asked for.  Well balanced in flavors and texture.  We will most definitely be going back!",

Vegas yes is a 24 hour city but have you noticed when you get out of the club at 3am or after a long night paying vegas's light bill on the tables that every decent place to eat is closed? I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to food so eating at a little deli at 3am after 6 hours of dancing and 2 bottles will not work. This place is my savior! The food is fantastic! One of my favorites is the mushroom pizza. Their pizza is freshly made, dough is not very thick, and always cooked to perfection. Their gourmet style burgers are delicious and yes those truffle chips with blue cheese are yummy! On their regular menu they have a Chinese chicken salad that is amazing as well! Honestly I have never ordered something here I did not like. Best of all the service is fantastic. The wait staff there is on point! No matter what time you go!",

    "text": "This was the best place my boyfriend and I ate the during our last trip to Las Vegas.   We stayed at the MGM Grand Signature Suites and walked down to the MGM Grand from our room, to find somewhere for dinner. Unfortunately, everything actually closes at 10:00 pm and this was the only thing still open for dinner in the hotel. We regretted not eating earlier, but what a happy mistake this turned out to be!   Prices were higher than I thought they would be for a restaurant labeled a \"bar and grill.\" The appearance of the restaurant does not give you the feeling that it is a fine dining or gourmet establishment. However, upon receiving our food I was pleasantly surprised. Also, the service was very good, our server was a young Asian woman who was friendly, extremely helpful and polite. She was also very diligent about keeping us aware on the status of our food, refilling drinks, etc. Very impressive considering that our table was in a corner far from the kitchen. We also got complimentary warm bread and whipped butter before our meal.  What we ordered: For an appetizer we ordered the House Chips, which were \"truffled potato chips, Maytag blue cheese sauce\" (about $12). Great portion, outstanding flavor. For entrees, I ordered the Mustard-crusted pork chop, which came covered in a  rhubarb chutney, on a bed of semolina \"fondue\" with aged balsamic and a side of patty pan squash. My boyfriend ordered the Pancetta Wrapped Meatloaf, Mushroom Gravy, Yukon Gold Potato Puree, Fried Onions. (Both of our entrees were around $32). For dessert, we planned to take it to go but the souffle could not be done to go because it is served in the same dish it is baked in. It took about 10 minutes, because it is prepared to order, and was well worth the wait. It came out in a large bake dish the size of a large soup bowl, with two ramekins of ice cream and a large saucer of hot chocolate sauce. The server did a \"table service\" and prepared the souffle for us, cutting it open and pouring in the ice creams and chocolate. Slowly, the wonderful souffle puffed up and expanded before we quickly consumed it. To go, I ordered the Chocolate Beignets, which are small chocolate filled donut holes with a side of caramel sauce and ice cream. This was prepared to go and we ate it in our room.   The portions and food quality here were amazing. It was very rich, but not sickening, was not overly salted, not under or over cooked and everything was well balanced, nicely plated and extremely delicious. I would definitely eat here again.",

They are the best truffled anything I ever had. Truffle fries ain't got nothing on these chips. You will want to save the dish when you're done so you can dip anything else into it.  The flat iron steak was okay. It was made medium rare the way I like it. It comes with a mustard sauce but I didn't think it really goes well with the steak or fries. The fries go better with the truffles anyway :p  Hard to say if I would dine here again for a full meal if I come back go Vegas, but I will def come back just for the chips.",

    "text": "This will be a review of my experience and my meal in the order I received it.  As I sat, I found the bar area to feel a little crowded, the TV was too high to comfortable view from the bar, and the bartender was pleasant. I hate the fact that Coca-Cola has a monopoly on beverage service at any of the \"M-life\" Hotels (or whatever - thats the rewards card anyway LOL), as I am a Mt Dew and Pepsi product person myself, but not much you can do about that. I had a can of Root Beer, which was okay, a little different, a little gourmet, but what you would expect at a little nicer restaurant. They had a large variety of liquor, from cheap to very high end, definitely something for everyone. I believe they had an extensive selection of quality Scotch of varying ages as well, if I'm not mistaken, although I don't drink when I go to dinner typically.  I ordered the chicken soup, Mesquite Steak, and a side of french fries.  The Chicken Soup was a bit different.. IDK if it was the herbs, garnish, or what but it didn't taste like chicken noodle soup. It wasn't bad, but not something I would get again.. The broth was not chicken flavor like what you would expect from a typical chicken stock made with chicken and a traditional mirepoix of onion, celery, and carrots. The noodles were great, I would have liked my carrots to be cooked (not still crunchy..) but understand that may not be the same for everyone. I have the ability to, and often do, eat at upscale or higher end establishments - the kind where they don't put salt & pepper on the table because the thought of salting a chef's creation to your liking might damage his precious ego LOL - so I understand that things are cooked and prepared much differently than they would be at a steakhouse w/ a lower price point. However, I wish this restaurant (and others) would give the option to go for a different side. For instance, as I said, I also ordered the Mesquite Ribeye which came with a sauteed broccoli and tomato concoction which I was not at all interested in trying. I was a little disappointed to look at the menu on the board out front (electronic) and find a meal only to end up with a different menu inside. Not sure what happened but I initially hoped to get a different steak preparation that was on the menu out front, but wasn't on the menu when I sat down. There was one bartender that was pleasant and outgoing, I sat at the bar BTW, there was another gentlemen behind the bar in orange (like the wait-staff) that didn't talk or didn't talk very much, the same seemed True of the (rest of the) wait staff... What I mean is, when presented with your food there's typically a short conversation along the lines of - \"here's ur food...\",   \"Need anything else?\", \"enjoy!\", etc... I didn't get that, but the bartender checked in and I was okay with everything, just wanted Salt - shoot me LOL, which they brought me. Overall, the meal was Good.  The steak was done to my liking, it's always nice to find someone that knows how to cook a steak to a medium temperature, and the \"Mesquite\" flavor was good. It was not anything overly flavored - it wasn't lacking flavor either, it was a pleasant addition to the normal flavor. The steak was a quality cut, not overly fatty, and was trimmed correctly for a ribeye, again - something nice to find is a person the doesn't under trim or over trim a steak that's meant to have some fat in it. The meat was tender but firm, as it should be, and it was a good steak.  I also ordered French Fries, as they arrived, which was more than I could say for the waiter who I bumped with my arm as I turned a little because it startled me when he was presenting the plate (from behind me) because, as I said, everyone but the bartender seemed to be working their way through \"Mime College\". They might have said something low or quick, but it certainly wasn't much or substantial enough for me to hear or notice, IMO.  In conclusion: Soup - 7/10: I ate it, it was okay, it wasn't anything I'd write home about. I know it's just \"soup\" but the stock/broth was really different to me. Steak - 9/10: There wasn't anything in particular I would change about it, short of not getting it \"Mesquite\" (didn't see that as an option), but for whatever reason - it doesn't deserve a perfect score in my mind.  French Fries - 9/10: They're FF, I mean, what can be reviewed and talked about with french fries!? Well, at least a little bit! I can talk about anything a little bit, LOL, they were actually REALLY REALLY GOOD!  It's hard to explain, not any one thing I can put my finger on, but they were flavorful, done to the perfect crisp-ness, not over or under cooked, seasoned and/or salted to the right amount - Just a REALLY GOOD french fry.",

The first thin you might notice is that you're somewhat exposed to the public so it can get pretty loud - not a first date place if you want something more intimate and if talking/listening to your date is on your agenda.    We got truffled potato chips, mussels, salmon, bass, beignets and banoffee.  Truffled Potato Chips: Homemade potato chips with blue cheese sauce drizzled with truffle oil, Served hot and crispy. I'm not a fan of blue cheese but I liked this because of the truffle oil. 5/5  Steamed Black Mussels: Comes with grilled sourdough, chorizo, white wine, garlic and smoked paprika Bernaise. Very interesting twist to a boring bivalve. 4/5  Barbecued Pacific Salmon: Served with caramelized white corn, peas, baby heirloom tomatoes,arugula and crispy onion rings on top. I don't like peas so I was busy sorting my peas from my corn.  The crispy onions saved the dish. 3/5  Bass:  Comes with baby artichokes, white beans in tomato-olive vinaigrette and Romesco sauce. This was more interesting than the salmon. 4/5  Chocolate Beignets: Dusted with powdered sugar and omes with a caramel dipping sauce and vanilla ice cream. They look like chocolate cake doughnut holes but they're less dense. 3/5  Banoffee: It has the consistency of a cheesecake. Not too sweet. I was very intrigued by this as I've always wanted to try banoffee pie. This is my first taste of it and I was not impressed. I'm hoping this is not the best version of said pie because if this is it then, forget it! 3/5",

Overall I would recommend this restaurant to people looking for something at MGM but don't think I would seek it out again due to the limited menu selection.",

I've found service in Vegas to be all over the dial. Great service at Guy Savoy's and Rao's of course, but there are the hidden gems like Michael's and YellowTail. Wolfgang's definitely makes the HG list!  WHEN YOU GO- The place is open till 6 am on weekends and has an excellent early morning drink menu (it's Vegas- get your drink on 24/7). You can reserve, but the walk up wait was 5 minutes on a Saturday night at 8pm.",

The ambiance was actually really nice, considering it was open to the middle of the casino. The service was attentive and the setup of the dining area was really chic.   I had the mushroom pizza, spicy spaghetti and meatballs, and the chef's soup of the day. The pizza was cooked perfectly...just the way I like it: Thin crispy crust with just the right amount of toppings in every mouth watering bite. The spicy spaghetti was indeed spicy but not too much to handle.   Overall, this place was cute...it works if you're looking for a casual dining experience.",

Based on the pic it almost looks like something you'd get at Cheesecake Factory.  Aside from the presentation though, the chicken was cooked very well and the crispy breading actually tasted like a lot of love was put into it.  It didn't blow me away like the Risotto I had before, but I still enjoyed it.  Service still wins me over here as our waiter was very helpful and always checked on us.  3 stars for the food and 5 stars for the service, which averages out to 4 stars!

    "text": "I have come to realize that Wolfgang Puck's name is ALL over Las Vegas.  He seems to have a restaurant in every casino on the Las Vegas strip (am exaggerating but you get the idea).  My boyfriend ate something with pancetta in it last year and it changed his life.  He kept talking about it all year long so we decided to reawaken his taste buds by returning to Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill.  There seems to always be a wait but never a long one.  The restaurant is practically smack dab in the middle of the casino making it easy to find.  Unfortunately I was sitting right next to this giant light in the ground that blinded me every time I shifted in my seat.  I was tempted to ask to be seated elsewhere but I was too hungry to move so I just sucked it up.  But the next time you're about to get seated next to this giant twine sculpture with the light in the ground, I advise you to ask to be seated elsewhere before you plant your bottom.  We were disappointed to see that the menu has changed since the last time we were there and my boyfriend could not find his heavenly pancetta risotto dish and settled for a pancetta wrapped meatloaf instead.  I quickly snuck a peek at yelp to see whats good and decided on a wild mushroom ravioli.  The waiter sadly informed me that the dish was no longer available and recommended the gnocchi with a bolognese sauce.  Although I was a bit disappointed, I went with his suggestion.  We also decided to start with the crab cakes as we were both ravishingly hungry by this time.  The crab cakes came out in four tiny little cakes.  Albeit rather small, they were packed with flavor.  I would return just to get three orders of the crab cakes for myself.  The pancetta wrapped meatloaf was nothing like your mother used to make.  The pancetta was baked to a nice crisp while the meatloaf was soft and juicy.  My gnocchi was good but I probably wouldn't get it again.  It was not very memorable and it was just so-so to me.  I think I was just bummed that I didn't get to try the ravioli that my fellow yelpers raved about.",

I cut through the breast very carefully so as to not damage the freshwater pearl that must have been in there. I never found it.  That was my first night in Vegas. It was a wake-up reminder that I wasn't in Austin anymore. But Wolfgang's is the only sit-down place open after 10:30pm in the MGM. This means 2 subsequent visits, each more stellar than the first. Both exercised my economic know-how.  Visit 2: mussels with frittes. Yummmm. Huge serving, enough to share. But saying the word \"share\" is saying \"charge me an extra $4.50 because I don't know what else to do with that money.\" Dumb. As the words were coming out of the boy's mouth, I knew we were toast. .. toast wedges came with the mussels... Hold on while I yummmm again.  Visit 3: we were golden. Linguine with clams for him, spinach side for me. Also known as: we SHARE both of those, in fact combining them for a delicious dish. They should include spinach in the linguine by default; it's all too pale otherwise. At $6 a spinach side, it was a way better deal than getting charged for sharing.   And that's how you work the system, kids. Don't let them take you down. You wont win Vegas - you wont take my house, my money or my honey from under me. I'm from Jersey.",

I like turkey and avocado so the smoked turkey, monterey jack and avocado on whole wheat grilled panini was excellent to the last bite. An ample portion of avocade was provided. The baby greens side salad was decent but not memorable.  Bruschetta appetizer was satisfying but nothing out of the ordinary.  Place itself is smack dab in the MGM casino and it's not really secluded from the casino. So don't expect an intimate quiet experience.   Service was very attentive as my water and ice tea was constantly being refilled without even asking.  Bottom line: I like this place and worthy of a try if you are looking for a casual bite at MGM. A bit pricey but I thought the turkey avocado panini was a winner.",

    "text": "Food tasted good but the server we had was so bad! He didn't come back to take our orders. For a really long time. He only came over because his boss noticed us staring around finally. Then after he took our order I saw him roll his eyes as he started to walk away. At the end of the meal he literally hovered over and over again while I wrote the tip and signed the credit card slip.",

    "text": "These are my top 5 favorite things about this restaurant:  1.  They are open from 11:30 a.m. until LATE into the night (I think they close at 6 a.m. in fact), so if you're looking for a classic lunch, a great dinner, a post-midnight snack or a very early breakfast, this is your place (they actually serve breakfast items from 11 p.m. onward).  2.  Location, location, location.  They're right in the center of the MGM next to the Ka (Cirque du Soleil) theater and easily accessible from everywhere.  3.  On their lunch menu they have an amazing BLT which I often get without the \"B \"(thereby making it vegetarian-friendly).  It's awesome with or without the meat (maple glazed pork belly) thanks to the wonderful combo of guacamole, arugula, and tomato on grilled sourdough.  I would also suggest getting their delicious onion rings on the side instead of the pasta salad.   4.  The Chinois salad - with or without chicken - is a Wolfgang classic and a consistently great dish.  I believe it's available on every menu (lunch, dinner and late night).  5.  The service is always friendly and prompt.  Some other items that deserve a mention: tuna tartare, corn chowder (when available), and pretzel bread.  My only criticism is that the desserts always seem off - we've tried the pies on multiple occasions and they consistently have that \"refrigerator\" flavor.  But overall, I love this place and highly recommend it.",

    "text": "3.5 rounded down to 3 stars. Just catching up on my reviews from my Vegas trip earlier in the month. Had to place the reviews on hold because I ended up getting pneumonia just after getting back from my trip and I haven't fully recovered quite yet. I honestly wasn't expecting much from Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill so I was surprised as the food was pretty good.  We had be drinking quiet heavily before coming stopping by here for some much needed food in our stomachs. We ended up ordering the:  * Crispy Fried Calamari - pretty good. not the best I have had but above average in the land of calamari * Garlic-Chili Glazed Chicken Wings - I have to admit these would have been f'in tasty on any other night except this one. These wings were a little on the sweet side. They almost tasted like Garlic Chicken you might find at a Chinese restaurant but with a BBQ style to them. The problem was after consuming so many sugary drinks, the sweetness of these wings did not agree with no ones stomach. * Prosciutto, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese Pizza - The pizza was pretty good  The food was all pretty good but unfortunately it isn't something you can't get at a good Italian joint at home. In the end, WPB&G was just missing the WOW-factor and came off like your average joint despite having great service and good decor. 3 stars.",

I ordered the mushroom ravioli & the center of the pasta was cooked, but the edges of the raviolis had not cooked & were rubbery.  It kind of shocked me (not in a good way). I decided to try another bite- thinking maybe one was like that- but no, the next 2 pieces I ate were equally undercooked & rubbery. Unfortunately, I cannot say the meal was delicious, rather contrary.",

    "text": "We walked in with no reservations at around 10pm on a Saturday night but we were greeted and seated very quickly.  We ordered the almond crusted salmon main entree, the meatball pizza and the mesquite grilled steak skewers small bites (with some really awesome slaw) - all pretty tasty!  I absolutely loved the steak skewers - meat wasn't chewy and was cooked just right to my liking.  It went great with the slaw salad, and I'm not usually fond of slaw!  I think the only complaint I had was how we were greeted by our server.  She came, dropped menus on our table and said \"hi\" as my date and I were in mid conversation! When we looked up she was turned away as she had placed something on the other table behind us and was talking but we could barely hear her and we weren't even sure who she was talking to.  But when she turned around and came back to our table we got our answer and it took me only a second to realize she was actually already in the middle of the specials shpiel! Other than that service was fine.",

The Chicken Salad and Cuban are my favorites. The cheeseburger is fantastic as well.  Counter server Darbie provides excellent service, and manager Carrie keeps this place running like a well-oiled machined.   Overall, great food, great service, excellent value!",

Our drinks never dropped below 1/2 before they were replaced....not refilled....replaced!  We started with the homemade truffle chips with blue cheese sauce.....amazing!  The French style omelet and Tucson fries were pretty good but the\"BLT\" with maple glazed pork belly was super!  Had a nice brunch, thank you :)",

I wasn't expecting to like them as much as I did. The pizza was excellent as well. The portion was more than I could eat alone or should eat alone.  If you like a thin crust pizza that has great flavor don't miss this one.",

    "text": "The food was absolutely wonderful. I ordered a cup of their soup of the day ($6), which happened to be a beef and barley soup. This soup totally blew me away. The broth was so herby and flavorful, I couldn't bare to let a single drop remain in the bowl when I was done. There was tons of barley, good sized chunks of beef (but still bite sized), and some other vegetables in the mix. I kept eating it slowly because I wanted to make sure I savored each bite. I cannot compliment this soup enough. My main course was the salmon served with potatoes, arugula and asparagus ($32). I ordered the salmon medium well, and it came out perfect. A light crunch to the outside, and tender, juicy meat on the inside, and it was seasoned perfectly. The vegetables were delicious and cooked perfectly. They had the right balance of tenderness with crunch. I paired the meal with a glass of riesling ($11), which could have been sweeter, in my opinion (I love the really sweet wines), but it was still a nice wine. The atmosphere is pleasant, especially with the decor of the panes of leaves and flowers throughout the restaurant. The hostesses were pleasant and even pulled out a chair for me when we got to the table. Our server was also nice and helpful, and didn't forget anything, although he did give us the wrong check the first time (it was the check from the table directly next to us), he amended it quickly and with a sincere apology. It's a restaurant I would come back to because the food was just amazing. I could eat that soup every day for a week and I wish every piece of salmon I ever order would taste like that salmon. It was perfection.",

    "text": "Have you ever succumbed to peer pressure only to experience major waves of regret later?  Like that time you didn't want to wing-woman for your girlfriend because you had ill intuitions about the friend of the guy she likes.  This is Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill.  It bears a famous chef's name and lives inside a famous casino, yet is emptier in content than a stripper's conversation after the lap dance.  Our out-of-town friends wanted to visit Wolfgang Puck, I hadn't been there for more than a year and had no recollection of what I ate on my last visit, but out-of-town friends often get to make the decisions, so I suffered another forgettable experience at Wolfgang Puck.  We had the Pink Lady Apple & Pear Salad which was okay, if not a little drenched in dressing.  Then after our order of sea bass was rejected because the kitchen didn't get the fish that day, we got the organic chicken.  It was served on top of mashed potatoes, with roasted carrots.  Carrots were undercooked, potatoes and chicken were all right, nothing to make an impression.    Fifty dollars for a meal I would pay around fifteen dollars...  The latter probably would have a more authentic atmosphere, not a generic view of MGM tourists.  This is what's wrong with Vegas, a fraudulent copy to overcompensate for soul-less commercialism.",
