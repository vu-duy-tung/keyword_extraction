The place is located sort of strip mall and from outside, it looks nothing extraordinary but taste they offer is whole different league.  Everything tastes homemade and I think they actually make everything from scratch.    We had Carbonara with Chicken and Bolognese with meat sauce and both dishes were best Italian food I've had in my life.  Carbonara was really on point especially for me, because that Pancetta fat was like heaven on earth.  We also grabbed some Cannolis on our way out and we regret so much we didn't grab a dozen of them.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and visit here again.  Highly recommended!",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Trattoria on September 14, 2018 about 7:30pm. I ordered the Caprese Salad, Spaghetti with the Marinara on the side and Fried Mozzarella Balls. My husband ordered Fett. Bolognese.  The tomatoes on the Caprese Salad were soft and smushy. I took one bite and pushed it to the side. After us waiting for a very long time our food came. My Spaghetti was bought over to me by a guy by the name of Danny. The pasta was covered with Marinara sauce. when I told him that the sauce was suppose to be on the side, he questioned me as if I was not telling the truth. He stood there holding the dish looking at me as if I should just take it anyway. I told him I would take it but it was way too much sauce on there for me. He abruptly walked away appearing to be very irritated and annoyed that I would not accept the dish. I was expecting him to apologize for the mix up and that he would have the kitchen make it without again with the sauce on the side.   But, NO!! He left me sitting there feeling afraid to eat anything after sending it back, I think we all can relate to that fear. Anyway, at this point our server came by to see if we were OK and I preceded to tell her of our experience so far. Her name was JILL!! What a sweetheart, corrected the mistake made by the kitchen with lots of sincere apologies. I was not looking for anything other then good service. I understand mistakes are made, not a be deal. But that guy DANNY made ZERO efforts to make us feel welcome. This was our first visit and our last!! This place was recommended to me by a co-worker. I will not be recommending this place. We do however greatly appreciate the GREAT service and big efforts that JILL tried to give us. It was just not enough for us to ever come back. Being a business owner, I would never have someone like DANNY working in my business. You need more people like JILL.",

As an Italian, I can be rather critical of any Italian food I am presented with, but I can say I enjoyed my meal very much.  I enjoyed their tortellini soup, shared some of my friends salad which was beyond generous in portion and had all the good stuff in it - fresh mozzarella balls, olives, artichokes, etc., and I opted to have the spaghetti and meatballs for my entree.  Let me just say....their meatballs are FANTASTIC!  I thought the gravy (yes I said GRAVY) could have had a little more \"oomph\", but oh em gee those meatballs!  They they provided us with platters of cookies on the table...not a single one disappointed!  The staff worked very hard to please all us women, and the place is clean and comfortable.  My biggest disappointment about my visit was I forgot my leftovers!  I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this restaurant!",

Still as hot as if it just left the kitchen, I'm eating this now at my house (10 mins after picking it up) and it is JUST what I was looking for. This is a fantastic dish. Delicious, hot, fresh, worth the price. I dare say it equals the $30 spaghetti amatriciana at my work. The garlic knots weren't anything spectacular but it's a free addition so who cares.

The salad like usual was fresh and crisp. The meat balls were just like nonona's and the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was out of this world. Trattoria Italia has never failed us yet  and the owners are hands on people that are friendly and Aim to please just ask! I highly recommend this restaurant as it a cut above the rest!",

We came on a Saturday night; it was a little busy but they accommodated us right away. My husband ordered a Caesar salad and the farfalle al salmone. I had the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. Both dishes were delicious! The owner came by after our dinner to ask us if everything went well. He was very nice and courteous.",

    "text": "After finding this restaurant on yelp with great reviews, my husband and I decide to stop in for lunch. Let me start off by saying, the food is great. We ordered the baked pasta and a Cesar salad. Now the downfall. This is the first Italian restaurant, that didn't order bread when first sitting down. Originally our order included the bowl of the minestrone. We let the guy who took our order that we would like our salad and soup before the pasta. At least 15 minutes go by and here comes our baked pasta which was great cause it came out so fast, but we never got our salad and soup. The lady who brought out the pasta said she would check on it. She took our pasta away and then the guy who had taken our order came out and apologized for the mix up and then told me that they didn't have any minestrone soup. 20 minutes now after we put in our original order, you just now tell us you don't have something we had order. Long story short, the food was great. The service was horrible!! Definitely will not be going back here just because the service was so bad!! It's really to bad cause we really enjoyed the food!",

    "text": "I've been to this restaurant two other times and thoroughly enjoyed it. I've written reviews and called it a \"hidden gem.\" So, with great anticipation we invited our in-laws to share this great dining experience, except it wasn't so great. The bread knots were very good and the Caesar salad was good and large enough to serve 3-4. No complaints there. The rest of the family ordered pasta dishes that included sausage. They liked the hot spicy sausage but overall there wasn't much flavor and they said they would give their dishes a \"four.\" That's not what I had hoped for. Then it came to my dish. I started with the veal cutlet with a Marsala sauce. The cutlet was an almost wafer thin veal slice that was breaded with something that reminded me of breading on something you would find in the freezer section. It was like a fine bread crumble, I'm not sure how to describe it. It just wasn't very good. The flavor was just awful. It tasted like it was cooked in rancid oil. I had my sister-in-law taste it because she once worked in a food research lab. \"What is that flavor?\" She didn't know but she would not eat it. A Marsala sauce, in most places has a very rich flavor but this was was extremely mild and flavorless. Usually when faced with a poor meal like this one I will just suck it up and enjoy the sauce and pasta, but the sauce was not very good. So, on this occasion I did something I have done only a couple times in my life (I'm retired, so that is a lot of years), I sent it back! I ordered Chicken Saltimbocca. My expectations were up, this would be great! Wrong! It too lacked flavor, very bland. The chicken was cooked well and had dollops of cheese on top but there was no other flavor. Usually the sauce and the pasta are the best part, but not on this night. There were no add in flavors like artichoke hearts, prosciutto, mushrooms  sauted onions  or olives. These will give flavor, but when you do not add these types of things and it is just the sauce, you really have to nail the sauce. The Marsala did have mushrooms but it wasn't enough to cover the weakness in the sauce. I have written a glowing review of this place before, but this was like I went to a totally different place. Was there a different cook? Did they change their sauce recipes? Because everyone else gave it a four, I will give it three stars. Based solely on my meals, I would give it a one. The people there are very friendly and I know they take pride in their restaurant, but it is unlikely I will return.",

I ate so many of those garlic knots - they came out freshly baked and piping hot. As soon as we ran out of the basket, we were immediately given another basket.   In terms of entrees, I had the lasagna, my brother had the fettuccine Bolognese and my dad had the orecchiette with sausage.

She doesn't eat red meat like us and recommended me the Special of the Day! Before our entrees, the servers provided us a fresh basket of garlic knots and they were so soft and just baked. We tried their Minestrone and that soup was very flavorful. It took some time before we had our entrees, but it was absolute worth the wait! I had the Pappardelle with Shrimp dressed in Pesto sauce and it was DELICIOUS! My fiancee enjoyed her Eggplant Parmigiana with Angel Hair pasta. Afterwards, we thanked Milana for her kind and welcoming gesture. She went above and beyond and gave us a bunch of cookies to take home with us! Unbelievable and so generous!

Then, I had an eggplant parmesan and my husband had spaghetti and meatballs and both were a good portion size and very tasty! The service was very good and they came to fill up our water every few minutes.",

    "text": "I'm really disappointed in this place. I'm all for local businesses, but this one really dropped the ball.  I had ordered their gluten-free pasta a few times in the past, always let them know I had an allergy and all was fine. Last weekend my husband picks up our order, we eat it and about 25 minutes later I get a phone call from them. Someone else had placed the same order with regular pasta around the same time we did, and they gave me their order. WOW! When someone informs you they have a food ALLERGY, you take serious precautions to ensure those allergens are avoided. You don't accidentally give them the wrong order! That aside, I was willing to accept their apology for ruining my Saturday night (which was then spent mostly in the bathroom thanks to their screw up) and refund of my order. Nearly 7 days later I realize the refund still had not been issued. I contacted GrubHub who informed me a refund was not even being processed! GrubHub called them and they said they needed to speak to the owner before issuing my refund, who then said he was going to call me.  I never received a call from him, but I did receive one from Yelp relaying the owner's message that he wanted to see how severe my reaction was before issuing the refund!!!!!! Are you freakin kidding me!? I explained it to the Yelp employee and was then finally issued a refund. I can't believe I had to even explain to someone the level of my allergy to justify a refund of an INCORRECT ORDER! I understand mistakes happen but when it comes to food allergies in the restaurant business, mistakes  CANNOT happen! On top of that, the way this restaurant went about their own mistake was all kinds of awful. It's just not worth it in my opinion.",

    "text": "I've been on the hunt for a traditional Italian spot in the Henderson area for quite some time. What I have mostly found is disappointed and terrible food, until today when I found Trattoria Italia.  When you pull up it looks like a extremely small store in a strip mall. I was expecting 5 tables and a counter. When entering you're presented with two dining rooms which could easily seat 70 people. The place looks rustic and very much what you find in Italy. There are quite a few family size tables and the decor makes you feel at home. Sinatra was on the radio and the staff treats you like family. There were wine racks in the dining room as well as a wooden shelf with various items like olives, olive oil, canned tomatoes, pasta, etc. The lighting was dark but it fit the mood.   I found through speaking to the owner that it is family owned and they are from Sicily. Both him and the chef had a very thick accent and they were very humble. As guests entered I noticed that they were conversing in Italian with the owner. This place really seems like the local Italian spot in Henderson.  As for the food: I have finally found an Italian restaurant that doesn't over cooked pasta and freeze meatballs. The food is obviously fresh and the chefs puts his heart into the food.  I would definitely recommend this place to friends.",

Primarily for two reasons, the food is delicious & the prices are quite reasonable.  My wife ordered the Chicken Parmigiana for $19.00 and said it was much better than the 38.00 Chicken Parmigiana just down the road at another Italian restaurant. I also love the fact it's a family run local establishment.  The bread and oil that comes to the table is really delicious & you almost can't stop eating it all.  The menu selection is wide & they have a great wine selection too.  The atmosphere is defiantly casual so don't feel obligated to get all dressed up, but you can & still fit right in. Do not leave without trying the Tiramisu it's truly a wonderful treat & one of the deserts that put this place on the map.  Looking forward to going back!",

I did a triple take when my beloved Montesanos was not there.  So naturally we wanted Italian food so what a perfect time to try the new local Italian restaurant.  And I'm very happy that we did. We were greeted and seated by one of the owners named Pascal?  We were served by his sister whose Name Escapes Me but who had a lovely personality and attentive service. There were four in our party and we all ordered different dishes. The chicken alfredo , sausage and peppers sandwich , lasagna, followed by hand filled cannoli.  Everyone agreed their food was excellent. I'm so happy that the family-owned restaurant I lost has been replaced by a family-owned restaurant I am certain I will come to love.  It truly feels to me like a newer version of one of my old favorites.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience, excellent service, and relaxed atmosphere.  Not only will I be back, but I will bring more friends and family!  Please forgive any grammatical errors as I did this review on my voice app. :-)",

I think maybe if he wasn't on his stupid computer I would have got better service. The food here is very good but that was very disappointing. And the little bread knots that he gave me were stale. One time before I did order dessert to go and I was going to let it slide but that too was stale I think it's been sitting in the glass case for way too long.

Everything is authentic, the atmosphere is incredibly warm and inviting, and the staff is unmatched by any restaurant around . Do yourself a favor if you are on this side of town... stop in for a relaxing dinner, enjoy a glass of wine, and finish off your meal with a delicious cannoli or piece of tiramisu. I promise you the only thing you may regret is not being able to finish off the entire meal since there portions are very generous! The staff makes you feel welcome and like family, who wouldn't want to revisit such an inviting place with yummy food?!?   They are going to be an amazing success here! Welcome to the neighborhood  we cannot wait to come back and visit Trattoria Italia where Italian food is done right!! Thank you for an amazing experience, see you next week... or maybe in a day or two",

Do not skip out on the meatballs they are really really tasty.  Overall this place is amazing and I will be bringing alot of my friends back.  A truly hidden gem.",

Most of the staff is directly from Italy (I could tell that Italian was their first language), and both the ambiance and food are amazing. The owner, Pasquale, even came to greet us during the meal.  I had the eggplant parmesan as my entree and fried mozzarella balls as an appetizer. The cheese tasted so fresh; it reminded me of my trip to Naples. There was so much delicious dessert to choose from. I wanted to try the tiramisu- and it was delicious.   While I was there, I noticed that the restaurant was expanded with a new private dining/banquet room. I was so impressed with my experience that I decided to schedule our next company dinner there, as the new expansion can comfortably hold 80+ people and the price was extremely affordable.  I would definitely recommend this place as a \"must visit\" for tourists, and a great place for locals to make as their \"usual\"- especially if you want an amazing experience at less than half the cost of eating at the strip.",

There were two big ones in a very mild and delicious marinara sauce. I had the tortellini soup. I was stunned when they brought it out because it looked more like an entree. It was huge and again, very good. She had the veal parm and the boys had the chicken parm. Again, just outstanding. We haven't had good southern Italian comfort food like this since we left Boston 17 years ago. This is now our go to Italian restaurant. Oh, and the service if warm, friendly, and Italian.

It's a bit pricy but personally you're paying for quality Italian food, with a sweet bistro ambiance.  I loved it, and honestly haven't experience authentic Italian in a long time.

After about 4 months, we have been waiting to come here.  I like the menu and their flexibility as well.  1. Pasta - The wife ordered the Gnocchi with meat sauce and she really liked it.  I liked it as well, as the Gnocchi was both firm and tender and the meat sauce was very tasty.  They serve a very nice full serving and she brought some home for leftovers, there was so muhc.  I tried the Fettuccini aglio e olio with vegetables and asked for Vegan style, since my daughter is vegan and I was gonna give her some leftovers.  This was a fantastic dish. The fettuccini is home made, al dente, and the mix of garlic and oil was just right.  I really enjoyed the simple taste.  The veggies were cooked perfectly and very tasty as well.  I did not leave as much for her as leftovers as I intended...  2.  The pizza - ordered a large Pizza Capricchiosa, mozzerella, tomato sauce, artichokes, olives, ham and mushroom.  This was an excellent pizza, the mix of ingredients were just right.  The pizza crust was fairly firm and i was able to grasp it with one hand, fold it and bite into it the way i like to eat pizza.    3.  Caprese and Garlic Knots - We ordered the Insalata Caprese to start and the mozzarella and tomatoes were fresh, and mixed with oil and balsamic just the right way.  We enjoyed this very much.  The garlic knots were so fresh and so easy to eat.  I am afraid that if you don't control yourself, you will end up eating way too much.  We brought a lot of the food home, as we were really sampling what they had.  We also enjoyed their Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay.  The espresso coffee was also great.   All in all, a good place, good price and great service from everyone there.  I will be back.",

    "text": "I had mixed feelings about this new Italian spot. I came in wanting to like this place and the experience started out well. Pros are that there is plenty of parking, menu prices are reasonable, and I enjoyed my meal. Cons are that they are new so there are service kinks to work out and the sweets were not good.  On a Sunday evening my husband and I were looking for a casual Italian spot to grab dinner. Service started out great with a prompt seating even though they were busy. Our waitress greeted us quickly, drink orders were taken, and rolls were served.   The rolls to start were okay. I enjoyed them, but it wasn't like bread at other restaurants that draws me back in. I also had a glass of the house Muscato. Nice flavor, but it had a carbonated texture that turned me off a bit.  Chicken Marsala with a side of pasta was calling my name. It was a large serving that included two pieces of chicken. The portion was perfect since I wanted to save half for my lunch the next day. I really enjoyed the Chicken Marsala and would order this dish again. My side of Sauteed Spinach was loaded with garlic and delicious as well. My husband had Ravioli and said it compared to the canned version kids love. He said he would never return here based on his dish.   The waitress that had been friendly and attentive went MIA around the time the check should have arrived. By the time the check finally showed up I was armed with credit card to speed up the process, but she dropped and ran. Thus began the long wait for her to return to get the card and close us out.   While that wait began I went to the dessert counter to get goodies to go. It took an unreasonable amount of time to even get the owner to acknowledge my presence. Since they were busy I started out patient, but it ended up being excessive. He finally acknowledged me, but then the phone rang and he asked if he could grab it. I run into the same situation at my job so I was understanding and said it was fine, but then he didn't come back to me after the call. He wandered away and the process began again. I should have taken this as a sign, but I waited and ordered four desserts.   The desserts looked great in the case, but three of the four ended up in the trash. I'm a huge sweets person, but these were just a waste of calories. Texture and taste were all wrong on three of the four. The fourth I ate just out of confusion that it could really be so flavorless.   Overall, my meal was pretty good and the pricing was low compared to other Italian options in the area. I also like that the restaurant is casual making it a good option for families or nights where dressing up just isn't enticing. The bad service and bad sweets ruled this out for future dining out experiences, but I would consider them for take-out in the future.",

Once there, though, our experience was great from beginning to end.  Great food, great service, what can you say?  Nice ambience in the room, nicely decorated. The only small disappointment was the Canoli - it was just a little dry, but not enough to put me off. And our server threw in a tart that was outstanding.    The service was spot-on all the way, the food was some of the best Italian out there - luscious Veal Marsala to die for, wife had an outstanding fish dish.   If we lived in the area this would be a regular stop. Since we live 400 miles away, it'll have to be occasional.  Go there!",

In short, I need to be supervised. Cue Bethany E. She joined me for lunch here at Trattoria Italia to keep my carb intake in check. Long story short: we failed.  EGGPLANT RIPIENI: This baked eggplant dish is similar to eggplant parmesan but without the breading of most versions. Vegetable, sauce, and cheese, served bubbling. Goes great with the garlic knots, and the portion is large enough to serve as an entree. MUSHROOM RISOTTO: Special dish of the day but delicious enough to deserve a spot on the menu. Giant portion, saucy and packed with a variety of mushrooms. I couldn't get enough of this. Awesome vegetarian entree, may be even better with chicken.  ORECCHIETTE: Little ears pasta, my fave. Chewy, tender, tiny pasta pieces. This version is tossed with a light oil, broccoli rabe, and a rave-worthy sausage. This portion was the largest of them all and could easily be split and shared.   Our giant lunch was so filling and delicious that only a small late dinner was needed. The hefty portion of leftovers was helpfully escorted to Bethany's home rather than my own. Service was attentive without being intrusive, and location is cozy for a quiet date or ample catch-up conversation with friends. Looking forward to coming back for more!",

Are we so lackadaisical and comfortable with drive-through's and crap food that we don't move beyond that? That is why I search out all non-chain restaurants, the mom and pops and all the unique places that we can eat to support them so that one day they will be the prevalent ones. I invite you to reach beyond being comfortable and try a place like this one! Trattoria Italia is beyond all that in their restaurant and they even make a lot of their noodles/pasta in house. It may be a little hard to find but worth searching out! Owners Dion Gazzaruso & Pasquale D'Alba combine their Italian heritages and recipes to bring authenticity and a welcoming hospitality. It's located in a little strip mall on Eastern Avenue and may seem small but is so grand in their True Italian recipes and ingredients! We decided to start with an appetizer of sausage and peppers and it was fabulous with a sauce that is made in house. Yum! Our entrees were penne vodka pasta with chicken and a house made cannelloni, both great! Please join me in supporting True food! Hit this place up, you won't be disappointed!",

Going with a fellow Yelper Stefany means I'll be trying more than one thing.  I always say yes to that!  We decided to start with the Eggplant Ripieni.  Great decision on Stefany's part.  It's a bubbling baked dish resting in sauce and covered in cheese.  The sauce is flavorful and goes well with the complimentary garlic knot basket.  This appetizer is fantastic!   For the main attractions we split the special of the day Mushroom risotto and the Orecchiette. The mushroom risotto is incredible.  The huge dish of risotto was creamy and delectable.  I didn't want to stop eating.   But since we had another entree so I had to.    The Orecchiette is served with broccoli rabe and sausage.  The buttery pasta was combined with plenty of sausage and broccoli.  Again this was a giant dish of food.  We had plenty to take home for a second meal.    Dessert? They have a case at the entrance filled with plenty of tasty treats.  I was feeling quite full but couldn't say no to a cannoli.  But instead of the large I went with a mini cannoli.  The cannoli is fresh and indulgent.  The shell was crisp with no sogginess.  Yum!   To top off the amazing food, we had wonderfully attentive service.  She was good about keeping up with our water intake.  It was a great experience and I hope to be back soon for more!",

The complimentary bread basket was filled with delightfully chewy bread knots with a side of olive oil. When it comes to desserts they do not have a menu. Instead they have a display case of their Italian grandpa made fresh cookies, cakes, and cream puffs. We picked the cream puffs and finished every morsel of it. Yummy.",

We were visiting Las Vegas where a friend insisted we had dinner here. What a great experience. As soon as you walk in you know you're about to have a fresh, homemade meal. I got the Gnocchi which literally melted in my mouth. We tried the pizza and penne alla vodka as well which was equally as wonderful. The food came out not too fast but fast enough where we didn't grow impatient which I enjoy, part of going out to eat is the company and atmosphere not being rushed at the table. Reasonably priced. The pastries up front were fantastic and conversing with ownership while purchasing was a lovely experience. These guys are the real deal. Italians from Sicily, Staten Island and Long Island. I recommend this place to everyone in the area, I can't wait to return.",

We were greeted by the owners daughter, and served by her husband and brother. Bread rolls and water were brought while we looked at the menu. They also have several wines from Italy and Sicily by the glass which is nice.   We started with the pasta e fagioli soup which was delicious. A large bowl filled with cannellini beans, pasta and chunks of pancetta. A 5 star soup!   For our entrees we ordered the eggplant parmesan and the gnocchi with pesto and gorgonzola which is made in house. The waiter asked if we wanted a salad and I asked if they had a SMALL side salad. He said yes. A few minutes later a HUGE salad was brought out that could have easily fed 4 people. It was loaded with roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, buffalo mozzarella, olives, tomato and red onion. Although it was very good, I was a little upset I was brought a $9 dinner salad when I asked for a small side salad. A misunderstanding? I hope so.   The entrees came out and both were very large portions. You definitely get your moneys worth here, as well as leftovers for lunch the next day :)  The eggplant parm was big and covered in cheese. Served with a  side of spaghetti there was plenty to take home. The gnocchi were also very good, melted in my mouth. The sauce was very heavy and very rich, I could barely finish half of it.   The atmosphere here is genuine Italian Trattoria and with all of the friendly staff speaking Italian it is really an authentic experience.",

Overall it was ok but not sure we'd go back.",

Vegas water is gross lol We were greeted by a very nice server (I wish I had taken down her name!) After hearing the specials, I ordered the eggplant parm, my husband ordered the chicken parm, and my little one got spaghetti.   My little one wanted my angel hair pasta that came with mine instead of her own spaghetti, so I got to eat her meatballs. Yum! The eggplant parm was really yummy! My husband said his chicken parm was really good too.   For desert, I had an almond cookie, my husband had a canolli, and the baby had an almond desert with a cherry on top. All were really good!   Only complaint I have is that the kids meals are way overpriced. $8 for spaghetti is crazy.",

She ordered the gnocchi which was okay. When I ordered the Mediterranean linguine which is supposed to be scallops and shrimp in a light cream red sauce, I had asked the waited if the seafood was fresh or frozen.   His response was \"yes they are fresh...as fresh as they can be, cause we are in vegas\". To which I replied, \"what?\"  He replied \"yes, they are fresh\"  Later he came back and said they were out of scallops. Suspect sir.  He offered some alternatives to which I proceeded to order mussels in place of the scallops.   When I tasted both the shrimp and mussels they were both obviously from frozen. If not they were cooked suspiciously. The sauce was like hot red milk with no flavor.   Overall, suspect. For $24, that seafood pasta should be fresh or cooked better.  The waiter also mentioned that the Mediterranean linguine was one of their most popular items.   You're suspect trattoria italia.",

I usually don't order a meatball anywhere else because the meatball marinara from this place is the gold standard that most other establishments can't mimic.   There is just so much flavor in this and in every other item I've ordered here. You have to be hungry if you order the chicken Parmesan because it is a large piece of battered chicken! The garden salads with their oil and vinegar dressings have many ingredients. The spaghetti and meatballs are always good as the sauce is soaked well into the noodles.",

I know what great Italian food should be and this place does not live up to those standards. I guess for an Italian place out in the middle of Henderson, NV this place is considered \"good\" that's why they have almost 5 stars, but my experiences have been different. The last time we went in the service was bad (our waitress didn't know the specials to start off), the food was average (just like always), and the bill came out to $75 for two entrees and one appetizer, which I don't mind paying if the food is great, but it wasn't. This spot should be 3.5 stars at best.",

We are coming back for sure as there are several more items we want to try.  I do need to also say that the price is a little high.

And we decided instead of partaking in the yummy smells coming from the food truck that we would mosey over to this Italian restaurant for a good, sit-down meal.  SO GLAD WE DID!  You walk in and it smells divine!  This is now my Go-To for when I'm hankering for Italian food.  I mean.. there's lots of Italian places in Henderson that are tasty... it's just that this one is easy to get in and out of on Eastern.  Plus, their menu has a little of everything for everybody from meat eaters to pizza lovers to carb loaders to everything in between. AND I really like the homey, casual vibe inside. +The bread knots!  Seriously... could make a meal out of these with some wine.  Be Careful... they are addicting!  And best enjoyed hot out of the oven! +Arugula salad.... definitely shareable size. Super fresh and crisp!  The dressing is citrusy, tart, vinegary and went great with the green, peppery-ness of the arugula.  Just a hint of red onion and parm.  Perfecto! +Chicken Marsala - good portion size... unless you are starving.. you will be taking some of this home with you.  I only ate about 1/2... and it tasted just as good the next night when I warmed it up for dinner. Comes with a side of pasta... I mean... the \"side\" was enough to feed like 3 people. I'm not complaining.  I even mixed in the left over arugula into the pasta so I felt like I was eating healthier.  ha!  Well... I got some greens into my meal at least. +Capellini Andrea Korimba - this is a good size portion too... it's like baked pasta and eggplant parmigiana had a big baked baby.  YUM!  Mom took 1/2 of this home too. She said it was just as yummy the next day too.  Service was really good.  We arrived about 7:30pm on Friday and it wasn't packed so we were seated immediately and they brought out the addicting knots right away.  Since we had already had a few glasses of wine at Khourys beforehand we didn't partake in any more wine but they had a nice selection.  We saw some and smelled pizzas being delivered to various tables and thought we'd get one of those next time.  :)  I apologize for not taking any pictures, but I was just HUNGRY!  So, picture taking was not something I was thinking about at the time.",

We spilt a pizza which had large pieces of prosciutto and arugula with mozzarella. The pizza dough was so fresh. We are absolutely returning to try more dishes.

Would definitely order that again.   Entrees we got the basil pesto pasta with vegetables and lasagna. The basil pasta was perfect, not too much oil or cream for the sauce and there was just as much vegetables as there was pasta. The lasagna was also a big heaping portion and could definitely tell was homemade!

It's not a sports bar, and I don't want to watch Clorox toilet cleaning commercials on a huge screen as I'm trying to enjoy a romantic dinner. And then they had on some kind of Spanish soap opera? It's very random and not al all keeping with the tone of the restaraunt. Why not play old black and white Italian movies? If not something on theme with the restaraunt they should have nothing playing at all quite honestly.",

The entrees we chose were gnocchi ninni, chicken piccata, chicken Parmesan sandwich and orecchiette in a garlic oil with sausage and broccoli rabe.  My gnocchi came from heaven right into my plate. The sauce was a marscapone base with roasted red peppers, garlic and spinach. Creamy, dreamy, plenty to take home.   Most remarkable is the service, a family that made us feel like family. And the prices make this one of the TOP VALUES around. Grazie, Trattoria Italia, until the next time!",

Their chicken marsala is pretty delicious as well. Got a side of mushrooms and mixed some in, since I'm a big mushroom fan, although the side of mushrooms could have been a great side by itself. Great flavor. The meat sauce that came with the baked penne was yummy as well. There really wasn't a lack of flavor on anything.   For dessert, had the cannolis. Great way to end a nice meal. Yes, their meals are by all means not cheap, but you really get a great serving. Plenty of food for leftovers that were equally good the next day. If ever I get the craving for Italian again, I'll visit this place for sure.",

When the meal came I realized I was not getting my soup :(  The food was good but it was not very hot. We then ordered coffee and that was not hot.

When my husband received the check the server told us that she said she was sorry once already. She then took $9.00 off the check.   All my husband's customers had good things to say.

From the generous antipasti to the perfectly cooked home made pasta and dolci, this jewel is one of my favorites. They even have arancini! (a True Sicilian specialty).",

    "text": "Had an fantastic meal here today and an even more amazing experience!  I've lived in Las Vegas for 20 years and seen many \"Italian\" places come and go. Most are New York Italian but this is the first (off-strip) since (old) Roma Deli that is actually run by Italians!   This is no deli though. It's a Trattoria which is a type of restaurant in Italy where you can enjoy home cooked Italian food for a reasonable price, and this is exactly that type of establishment.  The dad comes in the morning to cook the sauces, dolci etc. and then the rest of the family come in throughout the day to operate the restaurant. You can tell as soon as you step through the door that the place has a buzz. The decor is cosy and warm but I think it's the personalities that really make the atmosphere what it is.   I love good food & wine, hearing the chattering of people, the clinking of glasses and the waiters talking back and fourth in Italian because it reminds me of Italy. Some lady on the table next to me wasn't a fan of the guys speaking in Italian or something and complained; I was relieved when I heard the owner tell her politely that if she doesn't like people speaking in Italian then maybe this wasn't the place for her.  Can't wait to come back! This is my new favorite spot and I will be happy to refer them any business i can to help compensate for people who can't stand authentic restaurants....I hope those people choke on their never ending salad bar!  Great food & wine at a reasonable price, warm & friendly service and a fantastic location...what else do you need?",

Our server was a lovely Italian lady, named Louda and she was most attentive.  My husband, Tom started with an appetizer of Sausage and Peppers.  The sauce was excellent as well as the sausage.  He then had the Pasta Fagioli soup and that was excellent.  He had the entree of Pasta in oil and garlic and loved it.  I had their Italian salad and our server suggested to me that I could order a half portion size which I did and it was plenty.  I also ordered a 10 in. pizza which was very good and Pasta with white clam sauce.  I prefer more garlic in the pasta sauce, but I understand why restaurants usually don't use too much.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and the clams were good.  I took a lot of my leftover food home since I ordered so much.  The portions are very nice and I feel the pricing is very fair.   We had several Italian cookies which were very tasty.  They do quite a good business and they do take reservations.  We look forward to a return visit soon.",

It's like my Nonna is in the kitchen cooking it, that's how good it is.  I brought my mom here & she's off the boat Sicilian.. and omg she was in love, the smile was amazing. It's hard coming from South Jersey to Vegas & looking for Italian cuisine. The Anti-pasta was banging, the prosciutto, parm, olives, roasted peppers were delicious. My mom got the Risotto w/fruiti di mare, and I got Gnocchi Tricolore(comes w/pesto, marinara & cheese sauce) soooo goood!!  And let's not forget the desserts.. the cannoli were amazing, and the tiramisu tasted perfect! We will always come here for Italian food, worth the 20mins from SW side of Vegas to East side!!",

This is ridiculous. My arugula salad had two underripe  tomato wedges. The calamari marinara tastes like ragu. The knots were flavorless. I am so disappointed and missing Montesanos.",

We ordered the fried mozzarella balls and lasagna, based on the recommendation of our waiter, and was very pleased.  Mozzarella balls were HUGE, and although, just 4 pieces in an order, they were perfect for 2 people. It was breaded nicely, not oily at all, and oooeeey gooey in the middle.  Lasagna has to be my favorite lasagna for the meer fact that it wasn't heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love me some baked lasagna that's cheesy and thick but, this was quite refreshing with the great amount of red sauce.   Don't forget to ask for the bread knots because (when hot and fresh) they go great with the aforementioned sauce of the lasagna.  Other than the food, we thoroughly enjoyed talking with the owners' son - I wish we got his name - as he talked about his family's business and when he first came here from Italy. It was a great conversation!  I will definitely be back =)",

The service was phenomenal and the food was incredible. We asked for recommendations on the wine (none of us are very familiar with Italian wines) and the server was SPOT ON with his recommendations! At the end of the meal the server asked if we wanted dessert- we were too full and had to decline. However, after a few minutes he comes around the corner with a giant slice of Italian wedding cake! It was amazing!!!  We would absolutely go back to this spot if we are ever back in Henderson.",

Most of the staff and owners are Sicilian, and over 80% of them speak with heavy Italian accents. The food and sauces are all extremely well prepared, with a number of surprises. And the desert counter, which are all freshly made here on premises, look and taste like an old world Italian pastry shop. All the appetizers and entrees have surprising flavors and composition. The one not to miss is the calamari appetizer, which also has Italian tempura vegetables and shrimp in it. This is an entree and itself. Also under the appetizer menu are the clams and mussels marinara. The sauce is spicy, but you can ask for the regular tomato sauce which is delicious.",

He makes every guest feel at home and like a VIP.    The restaurant is quant, simple, and comforting.  As soon as you walk in, it feels like you are in Italy.  There is no fluff or fancy features.  Instead, you feel like the focus is the food, and you will get a great home cooked meal.    We ordered the Meatballs Napoli, Eggplant Parmiagana, Gnocchi with pesto, and Lobster Ravioli.  Every dish was exactly what I had hoped for.  The meatballs were moist and airy.  The eggplant was a great balance of cheese, sauce, and eggplant.  The gnocchi was soft, without being overly chewy or doughy, and the pesto was outstanding.  The ravioli had good size bites of lobster, which remained in the perfectly folded ravioli.  On top of all that, the bread, which looks like rolls, is delicious.  I could eat that bread all day.  If you are looking for a home cooked Italian meal, this is your spot!  ALL-STAR PERSON: Pasquale.",

Trattoria ambiance & service:  The main dining area is one open room with a cool rustic Italian kitchen decor vibe complete with checkered red and white table clothes for a classic look.  There's a TV projection screen on the back wall displaying sports.  Our server was friendly and very busy through the night.  We had to wave her down for drink refills a couple of times but she took care of us immediately.  It appears they might have been understaffed on a Friday night.  The kitchen was great with getting our dishes for our party of 6 to us timely.  Trattoria cuisine:  We started with the squid and and calamari and both were great appetizers.  The calamari was perfectly crunchy and a generous portion.  I had the spaghetti carbonara and it was a treat.  The sauce was delish with the romano cheese and egg yolk. There was plenty of guanciale/pork in the dish to get me full.  I sampled the bff's spaghetti with clams in the white wine sauce and it was packed with flavor and had plenty of clams.  The penne and fettucine dishes at our table were also on point.    It's great to know that I don't have to drive down to the strip if I'm fiending authentic Italian dishes.  I'm looking forward to trying more dishes but that's another tale.  Enjoy! =)",

Located in a building with a few store fronts, by a Panera, it seems a bit boring or unsophisticated, but the inside is quaint and done with an Italian theme of paintings and decor, a small bakery with cookies and pastries greets you when you enter.  We were seated promptly and our server came over to deliver menus. Pasta, pizza and other Italian dishes are there for for whatever you're craving.  My daughter ordered the spaghetti, which she loved, my husband got cioppino which he loved, and I had shrimp pasta. I thought mine was good, although the sauce was a tad on the salty side.  Service was prompt, helpful and friendly. Would definitely try it again. (My daughter has since returned twice since we went a couple weeks ago.)",

I'll be donating this order of food to my neighbors who will enjoy this and I'll reorder from some place else.  Wish I could say this was a good experience but unfortunately this time is a total negative experience.  The chicken is burnt, dry and over cooked, nothing like the last time I ordered it from this place and as I've said above the salad had a large helping of olives.  I love places that pay attention to customers allergy needs......Maybe if I give this place my business again the kitchen will pay attention to the tickets...but after this total negative experience, I'll have to watch other reviewers first.

I got the chicken Marsala and the Baked penne for my boyfriend, he had it the last time we were there and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately tonight was a different experience. IDK if it was a different chef tonight or if they don't care about quality for the take out orders, but both entrees lacked flavor and the bread that came with the order was a bit burnt.

It took 20 min for him to stop by our table so I could order some wine, which wasn't poured in front of me or even placed in a wine carafe, so I could pour it. We finally received more bread about 30 min after ordering again. And this bread was worse than the first batch. It was small and hard and burned. It took 50 min from ordering to receive our food which was less than mediocre. My friend ordered a pasta and paid $3 more for Chicken. There were 3 small pieces, she waved the server over and even he agreed that she needed more chicken, which he had the kitchen make, but the kitchen is so slow the pasta was over halfway eaten before the chicken was served. But what I don't understand the most is that had we NOT mentioned it, they would've been perfectly fine serving us those 3 small niblets of Chicken and charging us. It took the table next to us over an hour to receive their food after we conversed with them a bit because service was extremely slow and everyone was wondering where their food was. I know it's not the servers fault the kitchen is slow. But he could've stopped by, checked on us and updated us about the food. I shouldn't have to wave a server down for everything.  A few other tables around us had the raviolis and BOTH sent food back because the raviolis were still frozen. I would never return here again. I love to give small business a try but this experience was awful. I came with 1 friend and wasn't with an entire group!",

The service was bad they hardly came around to check on us, our serving of bread was like little burnt rocks and the second was just funny (I'll insert picture) We could hardly get our waiters attention to order a glass of wine and it wasn't even busy. The food was way overpriced for what it was and after a little under an hour of waiting around, we finally got to eat. The food is mediocre at best and overall, disappointing I ordered chicken penne with a vodka sauce and paid $3.00 to add chicken, which would be fine, but when it came out it literally had three tiny pieces of chicken on it. When I requested more chicken they gave me more, which was probably the only good part of this dinner. Two other tables that had ordered ravioli, both sent it back because it was still frozen. (Which had also taken an hour to be brought out)  Would not recommend or go back.",

Arugula salad and garlic knots started the meal and was fresh and tasty.  Wife and i split a salad and it was plenty. Entrees weren't spectacular but they were enjoyable enough to draw us back. Everything tasted very fresh although my meatballs were a little bland - will go sausage next time as i liked the sauce a lot.   The deserts though are great.

    "text": "Finally a good real Italian restaurant in Las Vegas! I was born and raised in Italy so I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food, and I can honestly say that Trattoria Italiana is my favorite Italian restaurant. It's family owned and that gives that personal touch that you can't find in the chain restaurants; I met Milena, her husband Ninni, her brother Pasquale, her son Giovanni, Laura the waitress, and they were all so nice to me and my family! I like the atmosphere because it feels like being in a real Italian trattoria, I like the table clothes on the tables (typical in Italian restaurants but not here in the states), the bread is phenomenal, they make it with pizza dough and it's still warm when they bring it to the table, and the list goes on. I and my family will definitely go back to Trattoria Italiana!    We went there again for my husband's birthday the other day and we both had pizza: it was really good and I'm going to post pictures so you can see what I'm talking about!",

    "text": "I need to preface this review by stating that I have lived 2 minutes away from this gold mine since it opened over 10 years ago. I am incredibly disappointed that I hadn't tried this place prior to my first trip here about a month ago.   This is our second time eating here and it was as good this time around as it was the first time. The garlic knots (which are complimentary) were warm, fresh, and delicious.  We got the mozzarella balls as an appetizer. Amazing  The balls are gigantic and the cheese is fresh. It's served on a bed of marinara which is super flavorful (if you can make the garlic knots last, the marinara sauce would go great with it).   For the main course I ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It's my go to Italian dish and I am heavily judgemental of places based off of how well this dish fairs. I have to give it an A+. The fettuccine noodles were cooked al dente and there was just the right amount of sauce.   Overall, I definitely recommend this place. The serves is good, the atmosphere is nice, and you really can't go wrong with the food. If you're ever in the area, be sure to stop by, you definitely won't be disapppinted.",

    "text": "Let me put it this way: if Trattoria Italia's Lobster Ravoli wasn't soooo incredibly good, this place would be a one star joint.   To begin with, most food comes out way under salted and under seasoned. Very bland. If you send it back it comes out just fine the second time around, but when sending food back just to achieve flavor becomes their M.O., something isn't right.   Positives: pizza is good, cioppino is good, and lobster ravioli is great.   Negatives: food is very under flavored, service at the front is very pushy. Prices are too high for what you're getting. Oh, and their caprese salad has microscopic amounts of basil, and a copious amount of spinach and lettuce. Seriously?! I didn't order a house salad with tomato and mozzarella.   As for the staff, I've just come across much more accommodating staff elsewhere. Customer service and family atmosphere is definitely lost in this dive.  Putting aside all biases from my former love of Montesano's, it really is not the best restaurant around. So many other places I will go to in the future besides trattoria.  Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely not.  Would I come back here myself? Only for the lobster ravioli.",

Our waiter, Daniel was super nice and just attentive \"enough\".. didn't hover but did seem to know when to check-in. We each had a special, Shrimp in pesto w/ pappardelle was INSANELY DELICIOUS! Osso bucco was also VERY yummy! Tiramisu was SPOT ON!!  Generous portions of excellent food. Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes. This is the real deal for casual Italian dining!! Everyone's treated like family! Just what you want in an Italian restaurant. We were in shorts & t-shirts as were many others, but there were also people dressed in dressier date night attire, so I imagine anything goes.  Ohh. We also had meatball appetizer and they were done to perfection - served In a nice sweet \"gravy\". Very tender, perfectly put together... just firm enough to not fall apart/not \"overworked\". Cesar salad was simple and tasty, with just the right amount of dressing. Croutons were crispy and delicate. Garlic knots that accompanied meal were tasty too (not dripping in oil like some places). That said, their olive oil dipping sauce was YUMMY too. Yeah. We will be BACK!!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this restaurant more. We came with friends who had eaten here many times and raved about it. That set the bar very high - maybe that was the problem. Our server was Santini, the owner. Very personable and very welcoming. Another reason for wanting to like it more. And they honored our reservation when they were very busy on a Saturday night. Still another significant plus. So why only 3 stars. They brought the bread knots to the table right away. A hold over from Montesano's (the prior Italian restaurant in this location)?? The knots they served were a bit stale as if they had been on the counter in the kitchen way too long. Didn't stop me from eating them, but they really weren't great. We started with a salad. The $9 salad was more than enough for 4 of us to share and still have some left over. A suggestion to Santini - offer a half size salad for $5 so that when I come with just 2 people, I can still order the salad without having to throw out half. For my entree, I ordered the chicken Marsala. It came with a side of pasta. The portion was large - no leaving here hungry. It was good, not great. My wife shared the chicken parmigiana with her friend. They split it in the kitchen for them - a nice touch. And the portion was huge. More than enough for 2 to share. Again, good but not great. My friend ordered the orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage. Now that was a good dish. So overall, it is a solid local Italian restaurant where you can go to eat, but not a place to go to dine. I will try it again. I really do want to like it more.",

They brought us out some rolls that were ok, and when our food arrived and I asked for Parmesan I was shocked that he turned around to the table behind us and grabbed a bottle of Parmesan, like you would see at a pizza joint, I would have expected an Italian restaurant owned by Italians they would have fresh grated Parmesan . The portions were nice, the food was hot. My eggplant was extremely soggy and mushy with way to much mozzarella cheese so I did not eat much. The side of pasta was good and my husbands pesto pasta was good. The service was good, but could have been better.",

We were definitely pleased and assured him we will be returning and telling others about this wonderful treasure. Prices were moderate for the high quality of food and service.

The filling is good but the shell not so much.  It would be better if they filled them at time of order.  Service isn't the best since they have a small staff so be prepared to wait and reservations a must in the evenings, as there is limited seating.  Overall the place is nice and the meatballs are good too.  We would return because of the good pasta and sauces and authentic feel.  Side note, would love to see fresh grated cheese served instead of the Parmesan.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. I'm almost don't want to review it because I want it to stay somewhat of a hidden gem but it deserves praise.  It is my go-to restaurant when I have friends visiting from out of town because I am always confident they will enjoy their food.  I love their garlic knots, fried mozzarella, and their antipasto appetizer is amazing, I highly recommend it. I usually always get a pasta dish or gnocchi and they're always so accommodating if I want a different sauce than what's listed on the menu or if I'd like to add in a different protein. Their pizzas are also really delicious. The TIRAMISU is out of control good. The cannolis are authentic as it gets too. I personally love that it is an family run Italian restaurant, and I love way they absolutely stick to authentic Italian cooking. They don't over salt everything like Maggiano's or other chain restaurants, the pasta is ALWAYS cooked perfectly, and they still know American taste because the portions are huge, and you can honestly be as big of a fat kid as you want at this place.  I personally also love that Trattoria Italia is informal because it feels so welcoming, like you're walking into a friend's place. Is that cheesy? It's True though. You can come here for a date, just after work, on a Sunday evening when you look like a bum, it doesn't matter. I've even come here once with my fiancee right after the gym.  In my experience, I've never had to wait longer than what seemed normal for my food or check to come to the table, and I've been there on busy nights. Yes, there are places that have gotten my food out faster, but again, it's never been so long that we all start asking \"ok where's our food?\" The price point of this place is also great. I don't think it's expensive at all. It's not cheap, and it's not cheap food, but it's still way cheaper than many Italian places, if not most. I definitely recommend, and will continue to be a regular as long as it is here!",

The case of baked Italian goodies up front was also very inviting.   Service was very attentive and knowledgeable with plenty of specials offered in addition to their normal menu.  The dinner rolls were little knots of dough with oil and seasonings, hit the spot. The food was the real treat!  We ordered some traditional favorites, the lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs which were both delicious.  The lobster ravioli and tortellini soup were also very tasty. I give this place two thumbs up and I highly recommend it for a great authentic Italian meal.  Will be back for sure!",

The food was lovely and our server was nice enough to comp our desserts and affogato for us.  I strongly recommend my dish the lobster ravioli over my friend's tricolore gnocchi (and I rarely say that about potato dishes ever) simply because the pink vodka ravioli sauce is to die for! Spongebob and Plankton knew what they were talking about when they said that ravioli secrets were worth fighting for.  Cautionary tale that their desserts are no joke in size, with cream puffs the size of saucers and truffles richer than Donald Trump. Honestly, it's like these desserts got their degrees and went back for grad school. Then to top off our visit, their affogatos were a great balance of creamy and bitter deliciousness.  There was simply no downside to our visit, I would definitely like to come back soon to try their carvery entrees.",

    "text": "I am not not an Italian food fan, but I wanted to try Trattoria Italiana due to the good review on Yelp. I arrived with a bottle of wine in my hand and had a reservation at 7pm. The ristorante was full and around 10 to 15 people were waiting at the entrance. The owner look at my reservation and  I got a warm welcome. No problem with the wine ($15 corkage fee). After a minutes we have been seated in the back room at a very nice table. Waiter came immediately serving some filtered water and drop some bread with olive oil at the table. Open the wine with a smile  and telling us the specials. The room was full and all table were taking. We Ordered some Calamari  (sauted) and Insulate Italiana for appetizer. 3 plates of pasta . My friend was happy to get the gluten free option. The owner touch the table during main course. My spaghetti were perfectly al dente. Dessert was tiramissu and the waiter was very nice to get out of his way to bring a little bit of raspberry and blackberry to my friend who is glutten free and dairy free. The food was serve in large portions . The service was exceptional. The prices very reasonable. The welcome from the owner was magnificent. A special thank you to DANNY R, our server who take is time, to explain the menu, give recommendation, open our wine, always smiling , spoke quietly with no rush to a difficult table of 3 who had 1 gluten-free dairy free, 1 vegan, an 1 normal menu. The entire experience deserve 5 stars! Because we spend a relaxing time with good food at a low price.",

I've always thought Italian is heavy food, but I have to say it was light and rich. We had lasagna, eggplant parmigiana, and the special mushroom raviolis. All was delish. Can't wait to go back and try something else.   This service was as authentic as you can get with Italians serving you. Great service by the way. You can tell there are a lot of regulars coming to eat here.  Overall, one of the best Italian restaurants in Vegas.",

We were previously pretty dedicated to Montesano's as our regular pizza place and, like apparently a lot of people, desperate to find a suitable replacement -- that it would be located in the exact same space would just be a convenient bonus.   Unfortunately, the search continues. :-/  We did a large half cheese/half pepperoni, it was just over $16 (there's a $1 charge for take out, apparently, which is...fine  \\_()_/ ) and it was incredibly mediocre. I think the photo kind of speaks for itself, but it was basically the taste/look of a pizza they'd serve in a high school cafeteria. It definitely is pizza, but it's not really what you wanted.   (It's about the same level of fulfillment as Blaze, just down the street, in my opinion. Definitely not the  new regular spot I was so ardently hoping for.)  The guy that answered the phone was super nice and the staff inside was nice, and it's possible that their actual entrees are where they excel and the pizza is just an afterthought, but for our experience, and what we were looking for them to do, it comes up pretty short.",

We ordered the Italia Pizza thinking that since it had its name in it it should be great. It was tasty but really lacking in substance. Needed a sauce of some kind a few more tomatoes.

The antipast they have if amazing, the cheeses, meats and vegetables are fresh and delicious. I usually get one of their seafood dishes and the seafood is fresh, not frozen like other places. They also have Stella on tap which is nice if you want a cold beer. The garlic knots are warm and made that day when it comes to your table. They have a large display case of desserts and pastries that changes often but my favorite is the cannoli which are always fantastic. All in all this place is very authentic and flavorful, and no it is not like Olive Garden which is fake Italian, its a million times better,  i have never been disappointed with Trattoria and will keep coming back.",

The special -  vegetable medallion - was not just beautifully presented it was outstanding in flavor!  The mushroom risotto (for those who enjoy mushrooms and a saltier taste) was exquisite!

I DONT BELIEVE YOU.\" SHe wants to give me pasta. No thank you. I told her why would  I skip lunch, come here after work only to get refunded for what I paid and take more time out of my day to gain NOTHING. She was absolutely ridiculous. And she was issued about the Yelp as she brought it up. Too bad. Stupid. Why was she fighting with  me.?? I got my refund and waves  bye. THEY DONT DESERVE MY BUSINESS. OR YOURS.   So I've been here before once and the food was really good. Today I ordered for lunch and picked up and brought back to the office. I found a long hair in the food as soon as I mixed it up. I called over to the restaurant and a male named Guisepee answers and tells me there is no one that worked there with long hair. I tell him I would like someone to bring me a replacement he said to me that I could just come back. I told him that I'm not going to clock out for a second lunch to fix thier mistake. He said 'I don't know what to tell you\". What kind of bullshit restaurant is this? He tells me to give him my number and he will Call me right back. 10 mins later and still no call. What a bunch of crap. Is this the way you treat people that are patrons of your establishment Family restaurant or not Someone needs some better training  And I need my money back. I WILL Never RECOMMEND YOUR ESTABLISHMENT  AND I WILL LET EVERYONE I KNOW About THIS.",

I've always went to a different Italian place that is a little farther but they have went downhill so I decided to give it a try one night with my family. Everything was delicious and everyone loved what they ordered.  They have complimentary garlic knots which are so good! The service is really nice and everyone is super friendly.  I ordered the chicken Marsala and I was not disappointed. It tasted authentic and amazing; there isn't anything bad I can say! We also tried chicken Alfredo, seafood risotto, and a pizza. They have a lot of pastry's and desserts that I didn't get to try but they looked very good. Definitely give this place a try and see what you think!",

Even though I'm not usually a lasagne fan I would order this in the future. We split a large Caesar salad which would have served four people. There was a slight hint of anchovies but it was so mild it might just be my imagination. Basically, it was a very good dressing. They also served little knots of bread. Ours came out of the oven pipping hot. The olive oil had a hint of garlic which was too strong for my wife, I loved it.  Had the chicken Cacciatore which came with a side of angel hair pasta. The flavor was very good but there were too many red and green peppers. They needed to add a few mushrooms. Despite my seeming criticism, I'd order it again without hesitation. This place is a definite find and will be our number 1 Italian Restaurant. The only criticism is the service. Our server was observed working 9 tables so we had to wait a while for our check. Another server took pity on us and brought our bill. But, one of the cooks ran all the entrees out of the kitchen to the tables so our food arrived fresh and hot. I've never seen this but I loved it. Don't hesitate to give this place a try.",

We want to like this place as the previous Resteraunt was one of our all time favorites. The owners are very nice and helpful I will give them that. They work the dining room well checking on things. We sat at a middle table looking into the wait station. We sat for 10 minutes before we were told who our server would be but I guess they forgot to tell her. Lots of staff in the dining room running around but no one stopped to check on us for the 10 minutes. When we were approached we ordered an appetizer and a glass of wine and for another 10 minutes no wine to the table as everyone kept working the POS computer for orders. We stopped one of the openers who handled the wine delivery. Mozzarella balls were very good and I had the Seafood Pasta which was very good and hot. Wife had the Eggplant park which the outer layer was hot but the interior was ice cold. Not a good fist experience but I hope they will get better and we will try again. They did deduct the eggplant from the final bill which is admirable. What I noticed is that there is an over abundance of staff on the floor but all doing different things at the same tables. The Server who delivered the food kept getting the tables wrong or brining the wrong meal to a table. Again I hope that in time they fall into a rhythm. The table next to us had the same issues with service and order delivery so it was not just us this evening. We did how ever receive a free dessert which was also very good. We will be back and hopefully my next review will be in the 5 star range",

    "text": "I wish I could give more stars, but just cannot. We went to this restaurant, thinking that it was the previous restaurant there, but it was a new eatery. We decided to try it anyway. They seated us immediately, which was amazing considering how many larger parties were waiting to be seated. We were a party of 2. We were seated at a very small table in the very back, and literally squeezed in. It's as if they found out the max seating they could get by with and stuffed tables in. I'd recommend they take out 2 small tables for 2 in that back area, along with a table for 4 in the other, larger, seating area. They've crammed too many tables in the eatery...and if you aren't comfortable sitting there, then why even go eat there? Let's put it this way: They had to ask the other small table of 2 to get up so they could serve us our food. We were that packed in. The food was okay. What we both had was bland. It just needed more seasoning. The service was really great. And I mean that. I think the staff really work very hard. I wish I could give them 3 stars based on that, but the experience was not that good. They even gave us a free dessert to go, which was fantastic.  This is a new location for this restaurant, so maybe they'll refine the number of tables and add a bit more seasoning to their food. They certainly had a great number of people waiting to eat there, so they have a good following. I wish them the very best.",

Very easy process to order thru the app. Food arrived as promised on time. The problems as I see them are this. Carry out package is simple foil tins with paper tops. Really not designed to keep food warm and leak free. The Grubhub folks use the standard insulated bags for transport. The time to get to my house from the restaurant is literally 15 minutes tops. Well the food had to be reheated and the lasagna leaked thru the top lid. So many new modern to- go type containers are available that are microwave friendly. I recommend that they use this type. Sure they cost a bit more but add on the price for carry out. They already do. The food my guess wasnt that hot when the delivery guy showed up to get the order. Quality was average. I prefer Buon Gusto or Bootlegger. Just saying",

In the past we have ordered from here from delivery services and the food is always good.   This was the first time for us to sit down and eat at the place.  Service was great from the hostess, to our waitress Jill.  We were always checked on by all of the staff.  Our water and pops never went empty.  We were very impressed by the staff especially being former food and beverage people.   Hubby had fettuccine Bolognese and I had the canneloni.  We brought home fettuccine Alfredo for our son.  We also had the mozzarella balls for appetizer.  Everything was really good and the portions are huge! Their regular marinara sauce is delicious,  not over nor under seasoned.  The olive oil dip they bring with bread is super delicious, I think with herbs in it.  It's a nice casual family friendly place.  I will definitely bring my friends and family when they come to visit.  You can go dressed up or in jeans and a t-shirt.   To top it all off, it is very affordable.  Especially when you consider the portion sizes.  We had an appetizer, 3 entrees, 2 pops, a nice glass of pinot noir for under 80 bucks.  I knew I loved their food, now I know I love the place itself!",

    "text": "I wish 10 stars was an option to leave for this little gem.  This is one of the best Italian meals that my husband and I have had in a long time.  We have been searching the city for a good Italian restaurant that has eat-in and take-out service and we just hit the jackpot.  The food is spectacular.  We wanted take-out this evening so this was a perfect test to see how good the food was and how well it would hold up for a short drive home.  We started off with the arancini.  One order included 4 enormous, freshly made arancini.  These were the best I ever had.  The order came with a side of sauce.  This was a zesty, home-made sauce, not the sweet stuff that passes for sauce in most Vegas restaurants.  Next, we split a Caesar salad.  The salad was large enough for two.  It was cold, crisp and fresh as a salad should be served.  We both opted for the chicken parmesan this evening.  The chicken parmesan comes with a side of angel hair pasta.  The chicken breast was enormous and so was the portion of pasta.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was juicy and tender, while the breading was crisp.  The pasta was perfectly al dente.  Again, the chicken parm and the pasta was served with a homemade zesty (not sweet) sauce that we have been craving.  This main course also comes with a side of homemade knots.  They were tender and perfectly chewy.  I assume that these are made from their pizza dough as I also make my knots from my homemade pizza dough.  We finished off this perfect dinner with their homemade cheese cake and chocolate cheese cake.  Again, True perfection.  The cakes were not overly sweet but still rich and decadent.  Also of note, when they packed our meals to go they made sure to pack all the hot food in one bag and all the cold food in another.  I cannot tell you how many times we have gotten take-out and other restaurants have put a hot entree on top of a cold salad or on top of a cold desert.  We have found our new go to for perfect Italian!",

I can never finish a whole meal, but this time I cleaned my plate. Two of our party highly recommend the flavorful and filling gnocchi ninni. Before our meal, we shared the Caesar salad. It was enough to share between four of us and the dressing was fresh and delicious. After dinner, our friendly and attentive server, Danny, surprised us with two profiteroles-chocolate and coffee. Both were devoured within a couple minutes, even though we were stuffed. Seriously, make time to eat here.",
