Be careful if you Asian...the 1-10 rating is pretty biased..meaning the food is mad spicy for a 3-4 level.  I had the yellow curry which was really flavorful.  My husband had the pad thai and my brother had the pad see ew, both which were good but just too spicy!  So I have to knock them down a bit, since they would not honor a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon I had.

    "text": "I searched up hot new businesses one night and happened upon this place. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and suggested going. He seemed a little hesitant about the place cause of the neighborhood but was open to trying it out.  And he actually went there before me on a lone venture a couple nights later. He enjoyed the food and got me pad see ew to go as a result. We went the next day together.  The restaurant really is small in area/seating space but it wasn't too busy the day we came in for lunch. It's a very casual setting. We were immediately greeted by the lovely server who remembered my bf the previous day. She was the lone server and delivered excellent hospitality and was very attentive our whole stay.   I love that the water came in a bottle and was ice cold. We got the free Thai tea with yelp check-in which was quite sweet but hey it was free x) not to mention was in a tall glass.   We chose the chicken satay as our free appetizer. The chicken was cooked perfectly and didn't turn out dry. The marinade on it wasn't overly salty or over seasoned.  The accompanying peanut sauce was delicious as a dipping sauce and the pickled cucumber salad which wasn't too sour or sweet complimented the satay very well.  My boyfriend ordered the drunken noodles with chicken.  He got it with medium heat which was quite spicy but manageable. I suggest getting it mild. Noodles weren't overcooked or mushy and it wasn't too saucy; just right.  I got the pad Thai lunch set with shrimp (as suggested by our server) and it was a nice portion of food. It included an egg roll (with a delicious dipping sauce different from sweet and sour), salad with a peanut vinegrette dressing, and scoop of rice which I didn't touch cause I had noodles as a main. It had the right amount of spicy; not too much to the point I couldn't handle the heat. The lunch set is a pretty good amount of food and I didn't finish anything on my plate except the egg roll lol but I took them to go.  I am actually eating my leftovers as I type this review and the pad Thai is still as good as yesterday. Lost some of its  moisture as expected but the flavors are still there.  Food didn't take too long to come out and you could tell they took their time to cook it to order.  Our visit was not complete without our souvenir pic with the cardboard taxi haha. And lucky for us the previous patrons already left so we managed to take a couple pics with no one around lol with the help of our server too. Don't forget to take one with it as well!   All in all, would definitely be back. Must try their desserts and curry.  Love that they are open till 4 am and that they aren't located right on the strip. It didn't  bother me that there are strip clubs and adult stores in the vicinity either haha.",

Waitress let us change the soup when we discovered this and was nice about it. The Khao soi soup is delicious (curry base)! Beware though- we asked for level 2 spiciness and that already had a good kick for someone who does not really do spicy (my mom was still able to manage though). The regular menu options(anything not on the lunch menu) are definitely for sharing (2 ppl... honestly even 3 if you are getting more than just one thing). Will be coming here again on out next visit. Yum.",

The egg roll and sweet and sour sauce was very good too.  Wait staff was not very attentive and took forever to come take our order and refill drinks.  I still recommend this place though.

    "text": "Parking was easy - there's a reserved spot right out front when we went at 6pm.   Ordered level 5/10 spice - not that spicy. The spice tray, particularly the hot pepper powder, was plenty to compensate though.   Tip - tell them upfront to make everything less salty (unless you really like savory dishes), as Thai dishes are generally on the salty side.  Ordered the hoi jor ($8.95) appetizer - soft and flaky on the outside, crab, shrimp, and pork on the inside - prepared wonderfully! This chow Jo dish is hard to make and difficult to find at restaurants, and the last place we had it was not great, so this was a delight!  The kao soy ($10.95) noodle soup is also a hard to find dish, as it is more of a Thai home-cooking style dish that is rarer at Thai restaurants - the Thai place in my home town stopped serving it, so this really hit the spot!   The drunken noodle ($8.95) and eggplant ($8.95) entree were very good, although you'll probably want to order an extra rice for the eggplant dish. Bring it to-go and make rice at home for a second meal! ;)  Also enjoyed the Thai phrases, decorations, and especially the drawings on the restroom doors of a man or woman peeing. Universal.  This place was so good, we'll be back tomorrow before we leave!",

It is located in quite a sketchy area, but it is worth the visit.  Though if you are alone, I would perhaps visit in broad daylight.  I ordered drunken noodles with chicken (spicy level 10/10), tom yum soup, papaya salad, and coconut ice cream.  The drunken noodles spicy level was out of this world - I am a girl that can handle my spices and have never ever had a problem regardless of how spicy anything was, but I could not even finish this dish (the horror cause I always finish), and definitely experienced heartburn for the first time afterwards.  It was delicious and worthwhile though, just be warned.  The papaya salad had the fresh tanginess that I always look for.  The tom yum soup was flavored nicely (though I would recommend this dish a little less, as it is more soup and vegetables are more scarce).  Definitely recommend.  I can picture having some spice-offs here, though in the future, I would probably order a lower spice level.",

Walked in, and no one approached us about seating. The staff just had tunnel vision and just looked down the whole time.  Once seated, took her 20 minutes to take our order. Ordered the Tiger Wrap, which she told us was unavailable. Ok, now if she would have approached us sooner maybe we could have had a back up dish. She put in our order for papaya salad, which 5 minutes had passed and we still hadn't received our waters.  There were only two of them on the floor and I noticed most of the guests had looked irate for constantly waiting and trying to flag down for service.   With such a long wait for just anything in general, and lack in service, and honestly no apologies on their end. We just gave up, she never returned back to complete our orders, give us drinks or anything for that matter. We gave up, cancelled whatever order we had and walked out. That is something I had never done before especially being in the industry myself. I had just never received such shitty service in my life like that, and we're usually understanding with these situations. They just lacked common knowledge and any kind of hospitality.",

The servers were friendly and attentive (and very good about refilling water), and the food was overall very tasty! Our appetizer and soup were fantastic, the pad see ew was just ok, but I suppose that's what we get for ordering such an Americanized dish. The fried bananas and coconut ice cream were a perfect delicious finish. Prices were super reasonable as well!  While we were there, there was a large (ie, 20 people) party that was very clearly a big Thai family birthday celebration. Our waitress even apologized for the noise, despite the fact that we were not at all bothered by them - after the raucousness of The Strip on a Saturday night, we were totally fine with more family-friendly celebrations.  We will absolutely eat here again next time we are town!",

We ordered koi jor (fried dumpling), red chicken curry with level 5 spice (not too spicy- I could've went higher so just FYI if you like things spicier), tom kha (shrimp soup), and boat noodle soup.  All were up to standards of authentic Thai food. I have relatives who are Thai and the blend of flavors was definitely almost as good as homemade. (Bc ya know, nothing beats homemade, am I right?)",

My children ordered the yellow curry with chicken at a \"3\" for spiciness. It was quite mild. I wish we would have ordered double the meat because there was not much.  I ordered the Panang Curry with chicken at \"6\" Again I didn't think it was spicy at all and wish I had added double meat or veggies. It was tasty but just kind of lacking something.  I also would Recommend ordering extra rice as we ran out but had tons of extra sauce.",

Walking in, it's nicely decorated with very friendly staff. The Thai tea with Boba is huge, coffee as well.  And delicious.  Don't ask for lite or no ice, it'll set you back .50 or $1.  Understandable since it's a large drink.  The Thai dumplings were the best I've tried.  The sauce that comes with it is sweet and sticky.   We also tried chicken fried rice and chicken panang curry.  The fried rice is typical.  Nothing special.  The panang curry was good but it needs to be spicier.  I was told spiciness depends on the customer but I wasn't asked.  What I had would probably be a 1 or 2, I'm told.  Personally I think it needs to be up there around a 5 to really taste like Panang curry.  This is a short walk from the Trump hotel/Fashion Show Mall.    I would definitely come back and try different dishes.  This will be one of those places that I need to visit when coming to Vegas!",

You will actually find it very near the Can Can Room on the west side of Industrial Road.   Items Ordered:  - Pot Stickers ($6.95) - Pineapple Fried Rice w/chicken ($8.95) - Boat Noodles ($10.95) - Pork Laab ($8.95)  Pot Stickers (4/5) (6 Pieces per order) Tasty dumplings served with a sweet soy sauce. Plenty of meat and tasted great bathed in the sauce!  Pineapple Fried Rice w/chicken (5/5) Tasted very authentic and plentiful in portion size! (I was actually telling my friend that the way they cook their chicken and their rice greatly reminded me of this little hole in the wall place we went to a few times, just a block away from the Grand Palace. Ahhh, I miss that place!) The fried rice included ingredients you don't necessarily find in some more Americanized Thai spots like raisins and cashews. I look forward to other variations of this dish in the future. Maybe some duck fried rice will be next!  Boat Noodles (3/5) I've never had boat noodles before so I honestly don't have anything to compare it to. The broth was a bit sweeter than I probably would have preferred, but was still quite delicious! Again, no complaints about portion sizes here! They serve you the boat noodles in a big ole' bowl! Very filling!  Pork Larb (4/5) For starters, they give you almost 3 times as much larb as what I received at Lotus of Siam a few weeks ago. The spice level was on point and made it much more satisfying this time around! Definitely having this again!  (+) No MSG!  (+) Enjoyed the decor and got a good chuckle out of those bathrooms signs! Reminded me of the ones I would see at some of the nightclubs/bars in Bangkok (-) Service was spotty. The staff was nice, but we had to hunt the waitress down to get refills for our drinks and to get our bill. There was only 1 other occupied table besides ours, so I didn't quite understand why that was the case. It wasn't terrible though and it certainly won't deter me from coming back. (-) not much available in the way of parking. Luckily we went during a slow time.  I really enjoyed my meal here today and I think I could even say it is in my \"top 3\" Thai places here in Las Vegas for the time being! I will certainly be back to try some more menu items!  Yay! I'm a fan!  4 stars.",

    "text": "Although the street seemed sketchy, the restaurant was actually clean and welcoming.  The tables were quite large and efficient for sharing food.   The food overall was really good but the portions were a bit small.  The pad thai was good but the additional $4 for assorted seafood was pricy.  There wasn't that much added in so I would just stick with shrimp only if you want seafood.  The chow mein was a bit too oily and the flavor was primarily egg like, strangely.  The papaya salad was alright, the portion was decent and it was refreshing.  The beef salad was really good, the beef was tender.  The seasoning wasn't overpowering and the spice was reasonable.  The eggplant dish was savory and although some pieces were a bit tough, it gave a different dimension to our overall meal.  Highly recommended.  The calamari came out hot and crispy; it was perfected seasoned and the sweet sauce surprisingly complimented it.   The drinks came in tall glasses.  The thai tea was good, not too sweet but the lemonade tasted diluted.  The large amount of ice in each glass could have contributed to the lessening of taste.   The pricing was reasonable and it was a good stop for a late dinner.  The servers were friendly but there was some difficulty communicating.  Despite the barriers, their hospitality was apparent.",

Went last night with my bf for the first time in a couple months and although our server was sweet, the service was so slow for barely any customers. They burnt our food and did not tend to the spicy level I requested. The food ended up being way too spicy for us and I didn't even bother sending it back nor taking it home. We also ordered fried ice cream and all we got was a ball of ice cream with no whipped cream or chocolate sauce on top like they use to do before. Very unsatisfying. To top it all of our bill ended up being more than $50! The most we ever would spend here was $35. They charged us for getting chicken with our noodles (which shouldn't be extra considering we can choose our meat), and another $4 for shrimp. I guess any type of meat is $4 now? Not worth it at all. Not a good way to end to our night.",

    "text": "An undeniable lifesaver here in Vegas for those pre-clubbing dinners or post-EDM nights when you just want to get something inside of your belly.  Thai St. Cafe is located just off the northern end of the Strip, and delivers (literally) some excellent food to get those starchy goodness into your body. I've ordered delivery as well as pickup from them, and it is a LOT quicker to do pickup. My first time getting delivery from them ended up in a 50 minute wait. You can bet that we were pretty drunk by the time the food came.  Some of the delicious items we've ordered include: - Beef Larb (spicy and tangy, and comes in big portions) - Seafood Pad See Ew (can't go wrong with these flat noodles) - Chicken Red Curry (again, another winner!)  Each entree is around $10 depending on any added meats to the meal, making it an affordable dinner for you and your friends. I am getting hungry just thinking about them while listening to my electronic jams. If you are looking for a great place that is cheap and delicious, there really is no better place. Thank you Thai St. Cafe for making our Vegas nights so wonderful.  Oh, and if you come dine in, there is plenty of free parking and space for seating. Another plus!",

    "text": "Ok, idk where to start. This might just be my longest review!  Ambiance was comfortable. It was beautiful...inside. Outside, not so much. It's right next door to the Can Can Room. So if you get hungry after watching some naked ladies, you can always walk over to grab some Thai food.   The music they were playing was a nice tone. Had to Shazam it cus it was cute. Top charted songs sang in acoustic by Sabrina. Mellowed out the mood, I like it.   Now, my friends wanted beer. The girl at the register told us that if we wanted some alcohol we would have to buy some next door at XO liquor. So the boys got up and went to grab beer. lol. That's cool of her to tell us. Business buds?   Anyway, the girl took our order. We got nervous cus we ordered a lot and she didn't write anything down. We expected her to forget something....and she did. B+ effort for her trying to play it off and telling us she was going to check on it. Hah.   Ok, let's get serious.  You have two huge foodies and a guy who knows 99% of the las vegas restaurant businesses that's tried everything walk in. (He owns a hood cleaning business.)  We all have high expectations, and were serious about eating. lol. We were hungry! Ok...  Ro Ti - YUM! Friend got their first and said it took about 20mins to get. By the time we got there, the ro ti got to the table. It was the best thing we ate there... 20 mins was worth it? Inhaled it in 2 mins. Friend only got it cus it was the cheapest thing. lol. $4.  We finally ordered everything else.   Calamari - Not too bad. I felt like I bit into air for the most part. It's very light, and it was battered ok, but when you bite into it, the calamari was teeny tiny. Since they were all teeny tiny, we had a small hill of battered up small pieces of calamari. At one point I bit into a hard piece where I thought my tooth cracked. I spit that out quick. The sauce it came with was good though! About $8.  Beef Jerky - I actually liked this plate. The sauce made it much much better. Not too hard to chew, just right. It's beef jerky... This was about $8.   Crab Rangoon - All it had was cream cheese. yeah...Not a fan of this, and I love crab rangoons! To be honest, the comment that Panda Express had more taste to their rangoons was said. I think this was about $8.  Boat Noodle Soup - This was a friends entree. We all shared though. I felt like he had the most generous amount in this entree bowl. Lots of noodles and lots of beef. It was WAY sweet. Beef was pretty good and tender though and the noodles were yummy, but the broth it was in tasted too sweet. $11.  Beef Panang - This was my main entree. Large bowl with an okay amount of meat. This, I believed was good for the buck. About $9 + Beef $1. Came with rice. Only thing about this plate was that it was sweet too. The waitress didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it. I thought to myself that maybe they had their way of making it. Gave it a shot, and I was not the happiest. I've had a lot of beef panang in my life, and I was sad that this didn't have spice to it at all.   Tom Yum Combination - Ok, this was my friends entree. He had HIGH expectations for this one. It's one of his most favorite dishes. Again, too sweet! He said there wasn't much in the pot. There were 3 mussels, and the rest were tiny pieces of  seafood chunks. He usually likes everything spicy, but again, we thought they made it a certain way and thought it was the reason the girl didn't ask. $9 + Seafood combination for $4.   Pad Thai - This was the plate that the girl didn't get in our first order. We had to call her again to ask about it. My friend was really hungry so he got a second entree on top of his tom yum. Which he knew it was going to be not enough. AGAIN, this was sweet. It was actually the sweetest thing we got. I felt like I put some sugar in my mouth. I couldn't eat too much of it just cus I felt like it was a dessert.  $9 + Combination $3.   I was a bit disappointed with the food we got. I feel like someone had a sweet tooth that night in the back and made everything too sweet. Not one plate had a spicy kick to it at all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a super spicy fan, but just a kick of it is what I like. I honestly came to try the mango and sticky rice dessert, but I realized it isn't mango season and didn't get it.   This was the first time my friends and I didn't finish any of our plates, well, except the ro ti. Which was comped by the owner because I posted a pic on Yelp right away. THANKS! He called the server to do it. We didn't  take anything to-go. I do give places chances again, so I'm not going to say I wont come back. Maybe it was just bad timing. It was late in the night.  Ratings: Ambiance: A+  Design: A (The lighting to take pics of food is superb! Every time you moved around on the booth, it sounded like a fart. haha.) Service: C+ (She forgot one entree and my friend who got there first said his ro ti took 20 mins to come out.)  Food: C (a-ok) Pricing: C+ .",

Tom kha was loaded with chicken and mushrooms and had a very flavorful and coconutty taste but was not overpowering. Crab rangoon had juuuuust the right amount of cream cheese.  It was a bit on the softer side so not too crispy which worked very well for our taste buds.  The curry was very creamy and coconutty which again I absolutely loved.  Pad see ew had loads of flavor and was a bit on the sweeter side compared to other thai restaurants I've tried.  We ended the meal with a complimentary roti.  It was a 4.5/5 for me on the food but the friendly staff, cozy ambience and awesome music selection really made the dining experience absolutely wonderful.  Highly recommended to thai lovers, I will definitely come back again!",

We ordered the typical spread of food such as egg rolls, soup, shrimp pad thai, orange chicken and 2 different fried rice. I must say, with the abundance of Thai restaurants around town, this place did not meet my expectation for taste. I prefer my usual Thai places I frequently dine at, which are located away from the strip. The Tom Kha soup is my favorite Thai soup. I like my broth w/ a more coconut milk taste. This soup did not deliver. On the other hand, the wonton soup was pretty good. Both soups were served in smaller pots compared to other places. I preferred the taste of the chicken fried rice over the pineapple fried rice. We ordered 2 orange chicken. This was unanimously the least liked dish. The orange chicken sauce was too strong. Shrimp Pad Thai was ordered mild (not spicy) but it still came out too spicy. The same happened with the Tom Yum noodle soup.  This place is conveniently located near the strip and prices are decent. While this is not my first choice when I think of Thai food, the atmosphere and service makes up for it. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but we all know it's not possible on Yelp.",

Although on Yelp it's says $3.50 delivery it was actually 5. We had drunken noodles, yellow curry , larb, chicken cashew, basil fried rice . Thai tea was free which was nice . Every thing was full of flavor and oh so nommmmms. I must say portion size was small, I'm so used to bigger portions lol . But flavor was there so I'll overlook the small portions, they did however forgot my chicken cashew so I had to call the restaurant and ask them to come back n drop it off, the staff however didn't offer anything to make up for that so I bluntly asked for a free side of pickled cucumber salad which after a minute of hassling she said ok . So thanks for the free cucumber since ur driver forgot my chicken cashew .",

Creativity levels are running on fumes. I took lots of pictures though.   *Came for lunch with my D-school peeps. Prices are reasonable. Portions are generous. Lunch specials are available.  *The place is clean, almost too clean. Decor is modern.  *Curry puff was not good. Pastry was dry, curry was dry. The curry filling was essentially a crumbly mass of bland stuff.  *Boat noodle soup: What I ordered. An interesting take on beef noodle soup. It didn't taste like Taiwanese beef noodle soup, pho, bun bo hue, nor galbitang. It was much stronger with a strong dose of sweet. I suspected the culprit was some sort of plum-like sauce, but wasn't able to confirm. My table-mates loved it. I, on the other hand, get very angry when things that aren't supposed to be sweet are sweet. (Korean wings, I'm looking at you.)  *Tom kha: very milky, very sour, just the way I like it. Mushrooms, onions, cilantro, and onions were plentiful.  *Spicy basil: took one bite, approved of the seasoning and the spice. Rated 4 stars by friend.  *Red curry: took zero bites. Rated 5 stars by friend. However, she found the 8 out of 10 spice level she chose to be inadequate. If you can handle the heat, even a level 10 here would barely have you breaking a sweat.  *Highlight was the Thai tea. Free with Yelp check-in. Served chilled in a huge mason jar. Fantastic blend of tea and milk.   *In the sea of Thai places in Vegas, this one fits right in as being perfectly (and slightly) better than average, but memorable more for its look than for its food. I've had much better in Cali. Must be the Vegas inflation again.  *40, here I come!",

My 5 and 6 spicy levels in my Thom Kha soup and Green Curry weren't spicy whatsoever. Everything tasted really watered down in the flavor, like it was prepared for Americans who are used to eating take-out Chinese food. My boyfriend also hated his orange chicken.   The weirdest thing was the rice. We didn't eat it at all. It smelled like it was boiled in toilet water. My boyfriend took a bite and exclaimed, \"This tastes like poop.\" I'm not sure whether to blame the restaurant or Vegas water on that one.",

So I came in alone after work and order some potstickers, Thai Boat noodles and Pad Thai. Potsticker had great flavor except it was an as steamed as it should be more crunchy than anything else. The boat noodle was good and when I got to the pot Thai Flavor was a a bit Bland so I try to add some fish sauce and more spice I took a couple bites and when I kept mixing it through I found a bee... yes an actual bee in my Pad Thai. I ate some of it which disgusts me more than anything else A and it was a whole bee. I'm sorry Services mediocre I am probably never coming back and I don't recommend anyone else.

Service is real prompt , and the ambiance is unique . We ordered tom yam soup along with pineapple fried rice and thai red curry . All the dishes are delicious and are beautifully served .The spice level is even well balanced just as we ordered. In exception  to the the location of the cafe overall it is a tasty experience .I would recommend this cafe for real thai food.",

If you want fairly priced Americanized Thai food served promptly, in a location that is very clean and pleasant on the inside you'll find that here.   Parking: It's in a strip mall off Industrial. It fills up fast so parking in front may be an issue. If it's daytime it's ok to park around back or find a space further away. But if it's after dark...and you don't find parking up front many of you may want to find somewhere else to go.   3 Stars. It's good, but not great.

It's one of my favorite cuisines and I've eaten Thai food all over the world (unfortunately except Thailand). Up until eating here, my favorite Thai food was served at this tiny little Thai Cafe at the bottom of my street in London, run by an immigrant Thai family serving truly authentic thai food. Thai St Cafe is as good, if not better. The food is stunning. The portions are plentiful. The staff are lovely and friendly. The hours are 11am to 4am!! They serve Curry Puffs!! NOBODY SERVES CURRY PUFFS!! These things are delicious!! Anyway, I digress. \"Well, if it's so good, then why only 4 stars,\" you might ask. Well, the service is pedestrian to say the least. If you're in a hurry, do not go. Actually, the food is so good, you should wait! That is my only negative thing though. Slow service. But everything else is top, TOP notch!! My fave Thai ever!!",

First time here as I was looking for a new off the strip spot and while the initial interaction leaves something to be desired since we had to wait a while to order especially when the restuarant was empty. The food was good and the spicy heat is right on. Now they do have some funky quirks such as charging more if you ask for less ice. Be mindful as the staff doesnt tell you of the add on. Gratuity is automatically added so be mindful.  Staff is friendly so that's nice. I'm going with a 4 star because the food was good and it made up for the initial experience. I'd give it a try again.",

First let's talk location. This place is in a funky building with the Can Can room next to it and Sapphire strip club down the way....  Inside is actually very well done. Nicely decorated.  Service was good and fast.  We ordered everything:  Hoi Jor - Really good! Huge portions  Crispy Rolls - Ok - but huge portions  Thai Dumpling - Very Good! Huge portion  Chicken Panang Curry - Good flavor. Very thin in consistency. I like when they are thicker  Chicken Green Curry - Good flavor. Still too watery   Chicken Pad Thai - not very good....no flavor  Chicken Pad See Ewe - Good, good flavor  Chicken Drunken Noodles - Ok-noodles we over cooked. Not much in flavor  Kao Soy - Good flavor! If I wasn't so full - this could have been a winner. Still very watery.  Orange Chicken - Meh. Sauce was good but the chicken was overly breaded.   Beef wrap - good. Different  Spicy Catfish - Pretty Good.  Pineapple Fried Rice - Bomb  Sticky rice - good  Good spot overall. But there are plenty of places out in vegas that I feel are superior.",

There were 4 tables sitting so they were by no means busy but still seemed as if they didn't want to work. I was excited to have found anew late night spot but left disappointed and the small plastic container of food for $4 more than I normally pay for Pad See Ewe did not make up for it. I will never return! Smh",

The place may be easily over looked because it's by adult stores and strip clubs, but they have bright lights saying \"THAI FOOD\" and marquee light arrows pointing to their doors. (Lol)   The food is good. Service was decent. I got chicken pad Thai number 7, and it was pretty spicy. Spicy levels are from 1-10.  We also got chicken fried rice and orange chicken. The last review for orange chicken I saw was complaining that there was a lot of sauce. My orange chicken was more like caramelized in the sauce. There was more fired dough caramelized in the sauce than chicken.   My boyfriend liked his fried Rice. I'll probably go again, but I won't order the orange chicken.",

We tried their Tom Ka Soup which was good, a little on the sweeter side but still good and nicely presented. We also had their Pad See Ew with beef and their Panang Curry which were the star of the night.  They were both so full of flavor and enjoyed them to the very last bite.  We ended the night with their sweet Roti drizzled with condensed milk and in the center some powdered cocoa as well as their Sticky Rice and Mango, and lastly their Coconut Ice Cream.  All were delicious but my favorite was the coconut ice cream!  The staff seemed a little overwhelmed but I think it was due to a very large party at the time.

PARKING: FREE, limited parking, quiet area ENTRANCE: a bit confusing because they have 2 (two) entrance doors but only 1 (one) works  INSIDE: surprisingly, inside is very modern, clean, organized with warm wood touch color and bamboo. Communal dining tables dominate the room.  RESTROOM: 1 (one) for each gender. Clean organized with supplies  DRINKS: The Thai Ice Tea and Thai Coffee comes as twice the size of your regular cup, shareable.  FOODS: ###Yellow Curry: a bit bland, not too much meats ###Red Curry: better taste than Yellow Curry, more meats ###Tom Yam Soup: a bit flavorless ###Pad Thai: taste good, mediocre presentation ###Egg Rolls: crispy, taste delicious  SERVICE: fast, friendly, helpful  This is a good spot for quick lunch.",

Ordered red curry combination. Received a chicken red curry. Politely told the server and she didn't apologize, just took it back with an attitude. She did not ask the level of spice for curry so it came out super bland. She gave me the smallest portion of rice with my curry. Asked for more and got charged. Looked over and could totally tell she was complaining to the other guy server about us. The guy server took over our table and although he was polite, I became super annoyed by the rude female server. I asked for the check and waited forever to leave. The female server did not have the balls to at least apologize and even check up on us. My boyfriend and I are regulars here and we will not be returning. I wish I had asked for her name.",

Fun decor, laid back jazz music, and good smells made it pleasant inside.   I was quickly greeted, seated, and served a drink.

Service could of been better though because he didn't come back to check in. I was the only one in the place at 1am but the employees with heeps of plates of food got more attention than me. I get micro portions compared to their plates!  I ate every bite of my meal and no one checked in on me but instead brought me a check. Lol really.  I only got an app so might of ordered more food or dessert, I should of been offered or asked if all was well before bringing my check.  Check your bill before paying! I asked for an ice tea to go since mine didn't get a refill towards the end and was empty on my table. Without saying anything he tried charging me $2 or more for the to-go cup of tea. Doh. Did take it off after I pointed out my displeasure and empty tea at the end. Do they normally charge for the to-go Styrofoam dishes for food, or just tea?  I rate them 4-5 stars for now and look forward to trying them again soon.   Enjoy!",

The waitress who is there late nights always radiates bad attitude and completely ignored us when we told her we were ready to order. Why are you in a service position if you can't be the least bit friendly towards customers? I understand I'd it was a one time occurrence but this has to have happened at least several times. The restaurant is never busy the times we've gone in and the only person in that restaurant who has been nice and provided good service was Julio. It's unfortunate to say but we definitely will not be returning any time soon and hopefully eventually they hire better servers.",

Then I got the red curry sauce with a combination of chicken, shrimp, pork and beef, a bit of a splurge, but then I was in town on business. It came in a bowl, like soup, with rice on the side. The creamy sauce was so good, succulent and delicious. The spice level of 5 (out of 10) was just right. Honestly, the shrimp were the least tasty part. I enjoyed every drop.  The restaurant had booths along the windows and back wall and wooden tables in the center, all empty. Everyone was seated around the edge. One waitress, several times, ran from a table back to the kitchen, as if placing the order were an emergency. I looked through the tinted windows as I ate, out at the parking lot and passing traffic. The Strip seemed very far away, which was fine with me. Inside, the overhead fans were all spinning as the air was filled with Thai music, playing from a Thai radio station, a nice touch. It was a cool little place, clean and well run.",

Lots of bean sprouts, and the only thing I would have liked was more vegetables in addition to the tofu that came with it. Also, I'm happy the portion was decent and not too big, and reasonably priced.  Server was very nice and very willing to check with the kitchen to make sure they could make the Pad Thai without fish sauce.  The location and exterior made me a little wary, but the decor and ambiance inside the restaurant was very nice.",

    "text": "Thai St. Cafe is located off the strip by Fashion Show Mall on Industrial Rd. For those not familiar with Industrial Road....there are many adult stores and strip clubs around. It's definitely not an area that I would go out of my way for but sometimes I make an exception, especially for some good eatery. Don't we all?  Ambiance was impressive. Far from the sketchy, ghetto-ness of its location and interior was very modern and hip. They even had a small stage with a microphone, I'm assuming they do some live performances?   Service was friendly and efficient. No complaints here.  First thing that caught my eye when I opened their menu was their Boat Noodle Soup. My server had warned me that the soup is rich and creamy which I did not mind. I loved the thin rice noodle which sort of reminded me of Japanese udon noodles but a lot thinner. It was very smooth. Beef in this was super tender. Soup had the wow factor. It is a cross of beef stew and curry. It had that richness and flavor of beef stew, but with a spicy kick you find in curry. I highly recommend this dish.  Also got to try their Drunken Noodle. I have never had this before so gave this a try and it was good! Again, I enjoyed the rice noodle except this is a flat rice noodle. I liked the fact that it was mixed with variety of ingredients including tomato, mushroom, bell peppers and onions which not only made it filling but made it look vibrant and overall a better presentation. I recommend this dish also.  Thai Dumpling was easily forgettable. It's a steamed dumpling, similar if not same as Shumai. It was clearly a frozen dumpling that was heated before it was served. Sad to say but frozen Shumai from Trader Joe's (It's called Pork Shu Mai or Pork Dumplings, try it if you haven't!) is actually better in my opinion.   I also want to mention that my water tasted odd. It had a soapy aftertaste. I'm used to the chlorine taste but my glass of water here tasted like it was mixed with dish soap.   Overall very pleased with my visit. I will be back again!",

Expect big bold flavors with great textures. The portions always look small when presented, but I always leave stuffed! Personally, I like to recommend the yellow curry with chicken for first timers. Everyone seems to love it. It is super velvety curry with fresh chicken, rice and veggies. It's a home run!  The food is very rich and so is the Thai coffee. Stiff, I recommend the coffee. It makes Starbucks look like child's play.",

    "text": "Tried this place with some friends randomly one night. It's on Industrial among all those strip clubs,  so I was a little wary, but I know some of the best places are in the cuts, and I gave them the benefit of the doubt.   From the outside,  it's a little shady,  especially considering the surroundings,  but the inside is actually quite charming. The decor makes it look like you're hanging out on a nice clean little street getting some truck food. The music was casual and seemed to all be acoustic selections from this Filipina singer Sabrina. Overall it had the feel of a nice cafe.   No alcohol served here, but if you go to the liquor store next door and bring your receipt,  you can byob.  Anyway, foodwise, I wasn't quite as impressed.  We sampled a few of the appetizers and entrees.  The theme for the night:sugar.  On the menu it says that they're not believers of MSG, but it seems like they just add a ton of sugar to make up for it. The pad thai,  Thai boat soup, Tom yum, and panang were all super sweet, and the panang was even a little sour? The rangoon and Thai beef jerky were ok, but nothing special, and overpriced. The fried calamari I liked. It had a hint of vinegar on top of the fried batter.  My favorite of the whole night was dessert, the roti drizzled with condensed milk. Nice, flaky, and buttery. The dessert isn't enough to come back, though.",

The restaurant itself is very nice, spacious and clean.   My party ordered a bunch of everything: both the papaya salad and glass noodle salads were great. Beef jerky strips were good. Pad-see-ew and pad Thai were decent. I didn't especially like any of the soups or fried rices we ordered. Green curry was a pass for me. The mango sticky rice would've been fine had the mangos been sweet instead of crazy sour. Young coconuts and Thai ice tea were excellent. Overall, food was okay for me.   The service was really slow that night. Our dessert and check took some time to come out.",

Another couple came in after us and were waited on first. They has two appetizers and their main dish served before we even anything delivered. Then when the food came 40 mins after we sat down they served our main course before the appetizer. And even then only one main course was served. My wife had  her meal half eaten before I finally asked where my meal was. They somehow didn't get my order placed. Not sure why they would think she was going to eat by herself. Very, very frustrating to go eat a meal and have this kind of service. By the time my meal was served my wife had finished eating and it was over an hour from the time we sat down until my meal was served. And it was not busy.  Which is all too bad because the food was pretty good. We both got pad Thai because we love it. It was tasty. Sort of spicer than most we have had but it was still very good. The crispy calamari is more crispy than calamari - not our favorite we have had.  But the pad Thai was excellent.   Just check the time from when we sat down till we finalized our meal: 1 hour 25 mins for two pad Thais and calamari.  In a half empty restaurant. Having said all that, it seems everyone else in the place was served quickly and taken care of. We know this because everyone that came in after us had left by the time we were ready to go. So it could just be an anomaly.   We would recommend it.  Bad service may have just been a one time thing.",

I bet \"Richard T\" can back me up  They always say, it's about location, location, location.   This enigmatic dining experience is quite possibly located in the most culturally flexible location in the world.   It's fair to recognize that this project delivers an experience for all of the human senses:   1. I can ~hear~ a parlay of different native languages layered with a consistent orchestra of ambulances and occasionally in this symphony you hear the disparity of another patients financial or romantic situation.   2. You can ~see~ transcendence in the the staff. The transparency of their service and the tranquil demeanor their team chemistry is great for their transient consumer base.   3. You can ~feel~ the difference between a spicy level 4 and a spicy level 5   4. The ~taste~ is great   5. The ~smells~ are particularly intoxicating. there is a lot of balance in their acidity levels. And the aromas in this venue are PHat  Don't go alone however; unless you really think you're prepared to go to that part of town and get served quite possibly the best pound for pound Thai meal in town..... and have no one to share it with.",

My lady was tired of the hotel food and prices so we got something different. She placed the order and I got the DRUNK NOODLES, spicy 10.  I had never been asked that question before back in California when ordering the DRUNKEN NOODLES but I was excited for this meal. The only issue was that they would not be able to deliver the meal to the room, hotel regulations against double parking in entrance!!! I get it though!  The food did not take long to arrive. It took about 30 minutes at most. After bringing the food up it was time to EAT!   The food was already smelling food before it even opened the plastic top. THAT IS HOW GOOD IT WAS! Once I laid out the food on the table and grabbed my fork I was ready. BOOM....spicy spicy and sweet. Not sure what other spices were added but the places that I have been to in San Francisco do not even match this spot!! The level of spicy is CRAZY good. Seriously, if you like spicy then this place when get it POPPIN all off in YO MOUTH!!!   Great dinner, great meal, fireworks of spicy flavor in my mouth and belly!  #spicy #hot #wickedgood",

I had way much more better Phanaeng curry (spelled Panang curry in most of the places). Fried rice was generic & had nothing bad or good to talk about. Thai iced tea was served in a huge tall glass.   I was kinda surprised that they didn't have any alcohol, not even Singha beer. Specially since they're in Vegas.  Overall, it's a great place to grab something good if you're staying in the Circus Circus or any nearby hotels.",

However it took another 15 minutes to get her new order. For the most part, I'd still recommend this place. I think the reason it takes so long for your order, lots of customers are ordering for pickup or delivery.   Atmosphere is great, don't let the outside fool you!

On our trip to Vegas, my boyfriend and I ended up taking a Lyft two different nights to get some great dinner. Food is amazing and authentic with good service. We tried the chicken satay which was so juicy and flavorful, dumplings, chow mein and crab fried rice which was beyond delicious. I'll be dreaming about it in my sleep! There is so much egg and fresh crab with stir fried onions making it the most flavorful and moist fried rice I've ever had. Don't miss this hidden gem in a strip mall... amongst strip clubs lol It's so good.",

The food options are like your typical Thai places. Tom Yum soup, Different types of curry, noodles and your rice dishes... I ordered the Tom Yum soup at a 3 and Damn that thing was spicy, but it was good even though it was burning my mouth I couldn't stop eating it.  I also ordered the Panang curry. It was a bit too sweet for me. The tilapia also really good, it was fried to a crisp with a sweet and sour garlicky sauce on top. As for the Beef salad it was just okay.... I've had better.",

I couldnt take it back because i was at work and I couldn't leave until my shift was over. I called the restaurant the next day. I told the manager the situation and he didnt care. I told him i could have gotten sick from eating that molded broccoli so i had to throw it away. He said he would not do anything about it because it was past 24hrs and i didn't have the food with me anymore.

The prices weren't too bad, reasonable cost that is perfectly appropriate for the quality. I would recommend this place, just probably for lunch and earlier in the day and not too late at night.

    "text": "First off, this place is located next to strip clubs, behind the Las Vegas Strip - so when my beloved Siri told me to take a turn into this plaza, I was almost about to take a U-turn.   But...this place has raging reviews & was the only thai that is open until 4 am (...and now we know why ;)) so I set aside my differences and went inside.   TOTALLY different vibe inside. Wooden tables, artistic decorations, clean bathrooms and  FAMILIES sitting inside enjoying their meal. My sister and I ended up ordering the following:   1. Crab Rangoons *appetizer* This came in an order of 6...and it was pretty on par with other thai restaurants. Nothing too extravagant, and definitely nothing that made you turn back and wish you never looked again.  2. Papaya Salad  This type of salad is my MAIN. Shredded green papaya, green beans, little dried shrimp, and peanuts PLUS spice level 7.....mmmmm good. However, some of the shrimp were WAY too dried, and during one bite, I thought for some odd reason I was chewing a stone. I hope I didn't lose a filling, but here's to hoping I never have to find out.  3. Pad See Ew  My sister ordered this dish but with fried tofu - as stated earlier, it was on par (my sister likes her spice to be as low as possible, so this didn't have the thai flavor I usually crave) - but I'll blame that on my sister's taste buds and not on the restaurant.    Overall, pretty damn good place. There's a lot more I'd like to come back and try - preferably during daylight hours, but it puts my heart to ease knowing that I can come in at 3 am and still be given good service & food.",

I know it's not the restaurant's fault on who comes in there, but by the looks of the outside area the place is in, you might expect this kind of thing to happen from time to time.   But nothing like this has happened to us before and we were just there trying out a new Thai restaurant.  I also wish the workers helped us more in getting this man to leave. It must've been the longest 4 or 5 minutes of my life while feeling in danger, while the workers stood far away from us at the counter and only asking this man to leave a several times.   There was no one else in the restaurant at the time except for the 4 of us at a booth and the workers.  This man who walked in, looked about 50 years or older, grayish balding hair, dirty looking clothes, a big sweatshirt, a big belly, and for some reason was carrying a big black cowboy hat on a string.. we could not see in his hands clearly but he had big carpenter looking gloves on.  He approaches our table with what looked like he may have been hiding something in his hands. Blocking the exits of our booth. He first asked where we were from, and we replied Hawaii. He then said \"what a stupid place Hawaii, why go there..\" mumbling other rude things, and he had a weird look in his eyes. Which we knew by now he must've been high or crazy, and looking for trouble.   We looked over to the workers who spoke up and asked him to leave. He ignored their request so we also asked in other polite, non-provoking ways to leave us alone like asking don't you have somewhere else to go?   He also ignored us and said somethings we couldn't understand and somethings in spanish.. And continued to stand in front of us. The workers asked again, \"Sir, please leave.\" He told them, \"I know my rights.\" And turned to us and said, \"Now observe what happens next...\" We had no idea what was about to happen since we didn't know this man or his intentions. I was expecting this to be the point he pulls out his weapon and threatens us.   He then said something in Spanish along with angry bible verses. He got louder and said something about the devil.  I thought we were all about to be attacked.   But instead, after mumbling more things, he finally leaves the restaurant. Someone said they seen him running down the street after this. We were very uneasy to go outside for a little while. We will be carrying a firearm next time we eat at a sketchy looking area like that, just in case.  Unfortunately that will be the last time we eat there. But I would recommend having takeout or delivery.",

Waitresses were all nice as well. I ordered the chicken larb and my coworkers had the regular sized yellow curry, lunch special curry, and Panang curry. The lunch portion was slightly smaller portions than other places in town. In all three curry dishes, there was a lot of curry and not very much rice provided. One coworker tried to order a spicy level of 10 and was talked down to an 8 but found that not to be spicy enough. As for my chicken larb it was probably the most bland larb I've ever had. I had to douse it with chili paste and jalapenos just to taste something. Service was also slow even though I know it was lunch time and we didn't order lunch specials. For some reason I was really put off by the cafeteria style plates that were pictured on the menu for the lunch specials. Overall not terrible, but I've found many other better hole in the wall Thai places in Vegas, especially with Chinatown so close by",

Besides that to speak on their delivery service I left very explicit but easy to follow directions (enter on this road, turn here, this is where the stair are, etc). They completely ignored every second of it. They called me to give them the gate code (they went to the wrong gate on the wrong road). Then I told him I would step onto my balcony so I could tell him where to turn since I have full view of the parking lot; instead he says yes thank you and immediately hangs up. He parks and ignores the directions again going to the out of service elevator, he walks back to his car and I'm waving at him with the light from my phone and whistled at him. He looks at me, stops... then walks to his car. Then I get a call asking me to come down because he can't find the entrance. At this point I think to myself that maybe he didn't get the special instructions I detailed. When I got down there I look at the bag and in big bold font it has all the instructions I detailed... why even bother if you're just going to ignore it anyway? I show him the directions that would have told him right where to go and he just smiles and says sorry. No effort given at all, I've been a delivery driver, those directions are there for a damn reason. Such minimal effort.",

    "text": "This review is actually 4.5 stars. Thai food is probably the greatest cuisine in the world. When someone mentions 'Thai Street food' in America, for most people the images of Pok Pok in Portland will stand as the measuring stick for anyone that claims to be doing this style of Thai food. There are good versions of this style of food in Vegas, as well as bad ones. Fortunately, I'm happy to say that Thai St. Cafe is one of the good ones. (And Chada Street is one of the 'not so good' ones :) )  So let's backtrack a couple of weeks prior to coming to Thai St Cafe. I was at Chada Street, the bigger name restaurant that was proclaiming to have the 'street food' of Thailand. Suffice to say, I couldn't see it. All I saw was Chada Thai and Wine #2. Not only that, the portions were smaller, and the prices higher. I was really disappointed with this spot.  Looking at the pictures of Thai St. Cafe, my hopes were definitely pointed towards the upward. Upwardian, you might say. So I came by on a dark and mysterious day. It's located on a shady part of town. But, isn't all great food, really. Walking in, I got the interior, it screamed Thai street. Lost were the pretense I felt at Chada Street. After sitting down, things kept on looking good.  Khao Soi. It's an underrated Thai dish. When one thinks of Thai 'street food', Khao Soi automatically comes to mind. And there are only a few restaurants doing this dish in town. Thai St. Cafe does it exceptionally well. Great curry, with wonderful egg noodles, just a winning dish. My only concern would be the raw red onion slices that they put on top. They were quite astringent, and they slightly overwhelmed the dish. Perhaps if they used pickled red onions, or roasted them, then it could have helped take away some of the sharpness or \"onion-ness\". But as a whole, I really liked it.  The Drunken noodles were spot on. I requested 'no tomatoes' in my dish (like always) because I feel that they do not belong in Pad Kee Mao. And you can disagree with me all you want. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. It was well cooked. As was the Red Curry.  The service was good. Our server made sure our drinks were filled, and was very friendly and helpful.   On a small side note, I think what was missing on this Thai street food menu was Khao Man Gai a.k.a. chicken over rice. If you call yourself a Thai street food place, you must have two essentials, Khao Soi (which they do) and Khao Man Gai. This, too, is my story and I will be also sticking to that.  I would love to come back here and try out more of the menu, particularly their boat noodles and lunch special. Michael K. out.",

Also had the opportunity to sit down, eat, and watch an Uber drive angrily kick out a naked drunk couple in front of the restaurant because they barfed all over the seats. Other than that, we ordered some classic plates, such as the pad thai, orange chicken, and the basil fried rice. The prices weren't expensive and the food was really good. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some affordable Thai food in Vegas.",

The decor is modern and industrial looking.  I like the clean look of it!  The menu was really helpful because it included photos of each item so you can get an idea of what is in each dish.    The service is quick and our server was very friendly.  The food is sooooo good!  It was so good that we came back the next night and ordered 'to-go.'   FOOD -  Spice Levels:  They are Thai spice, not American spice levels.  So be cautious when ordering your food. -  Pad thai:  Spice Level 3.  This was so good!  \"3\" was a good level for me as I do like spicy food, but not too much that I can't enjoy my food.   -  Boat Noodle Soup:  YOU MUST TRY THIS!  I ordered Spice Level 3.  This soup exploded with flavor.  It kind of reminded me of Bun Bo Hue (spicy pho), but with a lot more flavor to it. The beef shreds were so tender and juicy.  The beef balls were just as good!  I normally can't finish a soup bowl anywhere I go, but here I cleaned that sucker up!  Definitely give this a try!  I'm happy my fam found this place.  I can now add another food place to my list of Vegas eats!",

This one in particular was very interesting to try as the ratings were very good, but the area of town not so bright.  China Town is one thing, but the location of Thai St. Cafe on Industrial Rd. is a little off-putting.  The restaurant's inside is very nice but I wouldn't hang out outside.  I tried the eggplant and tofu and opted for 10 on the spicy level (top).  The level of spiciness wasn't over the top, burn your mouth, but it did make you sweat a little. The dishes I ordered seemed pretty similar though, as if they were all made in the same pot, with different veggies and sauces and meats added right before serving.  The taste and sauce were not mouth watering but still above average.  Not sure I will be back any time soon, but the prices are very affordable and portion sizes accommodating.  If in the area for lunch I would not turn down Thai St., but I will continue searching for the best Thai.",

Every time I've gotten the eggrolls they've been just slightly undercooked. Good, but they could use another minute in the fryer.   Overall still one of the better Thai spots in vegas.",

The ambience of the place is really nice and classy, which was super ironic, but the servers were really nice and friendly! It was a bit on the pricier side though, which was why I only gave it four stars. It was really good, but the price/deliciousness ratio was a little off, you feel? Overall though, I really enjoyed going there. Will definitely go again!   TIP: The noodle portions were significantly smaller than the rice portions, so if you're extra hungry, maybe you should get fried rice?",

The decor is clean and sharp. Very modern.   Weird to say, I loved the actual dishes. They were very different in a great way.   We had Tom Kha hot pot soup. I am in love. I don't live here and I don't know how I'm going to live without it. It was pretty hot, but in a good way. Next was the curry, I don't remember the name but it started with a P. It was great with tofu. We also ordered the orange chicken. That was super crispy, which was really nice. Drunken noodles with beef finished our meal. We ordered the heat level at a 4. That was a little too much for me (I'm a Wisconsin girl). The Thai iced tea was the biggest surprise. What a treat! Just order it, trust me.   Our server was more than helpful. She made excellent suggestions, even helped pair the proteins with the dishes. She was so attentive. Mind you, we visited at 11pm.   I can't say enough good things about this place.

They were supposed to close in 1 hour and a couple came to eat and they were turned out because they were closed... ???  Food tasted 7/10 it says no msg on the door but it felt like there was some msg in the food.. Not completely sure. And the tom yum I ordered, was delicious but not level 7 spicy as I asked for.  I didn't want to ask them to take it back and fix it because at that point I already spilled my water and the workers were irritated and had to move our tables and do all this extra work (which I felt bad about) so I didn't say anything.  Anyways, we Also ordered crying tiger 9/10 , wonton hot pot 9/10 (tasted somewhat healthier than the tom yum)  And drunken noodle 3/10(my friends opinion) he said they didn't offer enough for the price paid for.  The sweet sticky rice and mango also came with green rice which actually wasn't that sticky and $6.95! So expensive. Lastly, I'd have to admit. If you want the best bang for your buck don't come here, there's secret hidden costs everywhere and it's so expensive for mediocre quality food and they don't even offer enough to satisfy your hunger. I ordered side noodles for my soup; $3.95 Side order rice; $2.50  Tom yum soup is supposed to come with a meat any extra meat is extra cost. I didn't order extra meat just the meat that comes with it.. shrimp; $2 Drunken noodles about $9 for a pretty small plate.  I mean the inside is cute though and nicely decorated and fairly clean. It's just that this shop is set up in a plaza full of strip clubs and it's a little far from where I live. The only good thing is it opens late but even then they still don't let you come in at 3 when they close at 4!  I truly want to give this place another chance and think maybe their tom yum has potential to reach its ultimate spicy goodness! And that maybe we came on a bad day, hopefully they can redeem themselves I don't know. But their price point is still pretty terrible. 2 stars for now!",

The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I had the spicy fried rice, which was just \"so, so\".  The orders came out in a timely fashion too.  CONs--For starters, the waitress asked, on a scale of 1-10 how hot I wanted my rice. (10 being highest).  I said 10...but it was not spicy at all, not even a little bit.  They DO NOT serve alcohol.  I felt like having a Singha beer, but they don't have anything.  The only TV they had was not on, as I was looking forward to watching some sports.  Portions are very small too.  Would I go back?  No, if Las Vegas has plenty of anything (aside from casinos and strip bars), it is places to eat.  There are many Thai places in Las Vegas, so I encourage people to go elsewhere.  Simply put, the food just wasn't that good.",

    "text": "I preface almost every Thai restaurant review with this: My bf and I love Thai food. Well, he only orders chicken yellow curry every time, but the point is, we've had no shortage when it comes to our Thai food excursions. I can probably make an entire scrapbook of Thai cuisine, with half the pictures being chicken yellow curry. Go figure!   Enter Thai St Cafe. I was excited, really! Their reclaimed wood interior evoked cleanliness and a downtown-vibe feel. You've seen the type -- all the new coffee shops love this look. To drive in the hipsterdom of it all, Thai St Cafe even plants a bicycle in the corner.  Anyway, stars for being clean and invitingly pleasing, considering the surrounding location of Sammy Davis Jr Drive (aka Industrial Road).  Now the service: absolutely none. We came in right after the lunch rush, so we were the only table there. It was empty. Our waitress left us with menus and took our orders and that was the most communication between us. No checking up, no \"how is everything?\" nada. We wanted to order another side of rice, so we had to go to the counter and ask another guy for it. No drinks refilled. It was only after we got our check she asked us. Why would we want drinks now, we're leaving...  Food: I had their Tom Yum soup with shrimp (up charge), which was served over fire. I got a 2/10 spicy level, but it still was on the spicier side. It's okay, I could handle it. Plenty of mushrooms and shrimp, but too many onions for my taste. I tried some of my bf's chicken yellow curry and we both agreed we've had better. Seemed unbalanced, more coconut-y than most places. Overall, the lack of service ruined it for us and we probably won't be back.",

It may seem sketch at first glance next to Can Can Room and other adult establishments. However, I am so glad she mentioned we check it out. When you open the door, there is a cozy and friendly cafe atmosphere. The menu had so many delicious looking Thai meal offerings and it took a minute for us to decide. We ordered lunch special Chow Mein, chicken wings, and the best crab fried rice I've ever had! So much crab mixed into appetizing rice and our server said it was one of his favorites. I have to mention our meals came out quickly and were so fresh and delicious. As we left, all the employees were sitting together eating and they were all so friendly and thanked us and said goodbye. We will absolutely be back and highly recommend to everyone!",

On my first visit I never got a napkin (yes, I could have asked for one but it wasn't a big deal, and I don't think that the waitress came back after I got my food), and on my second visit, last Sunday both waitresses seemed to be pretty unfriendly. The word 'bitchy' comes to mind. There was no one specific action, but each communication I had with them was never polluted by a smile, and their thanks when I left seemed to be completely insincere. I'll keep eating here for now, but the ownership needs to step up their game. The restaurant seating area has expanded by probably 50%, so I imagine that they are doing well. They need to employ competent, personable wait staff or they will lose the ground which they have gained.",

I ordered for 4 people. they put my mixed veggies with oyster sauce into a styrofoam box and of course all the oyster sauce drained out and into the shopping bag. They veggies and chicken were so dry and tasteless without the sauce, I couldn't even eat it. They should have put it into a sealed box because.. that's literally what they use for everything else I am not sure why the juiciest dish would be put in a styrofoam box. Anyway, I called to give them a chance to make it right and they offered to make it again but would not refund me for the one dish. Then my coworker came in a showed me a plastic lid that she found IN HER FOOD. Needless to say, I won't be ordering from there ever again. There is PLENTY of other delicious Thai restaurants here in Vegas and this one is headed for the bottom QUICK. I wish I could add photos..",

Also, the sauce was cold and with no microwave available, it significantly cooled down the PadThai. I will know to ask for a small side, warmed up next time.

Broth was good. The curry puffs were not great I wish it had some chicken or something in there. I also ordered Tom yum vegetable soup it was a little to sweet for me. I had some shrimp and noodle dish I really like the shrimp in this dish.   Overall it was good for 1am, being delivered promptly, and in neat packaging with everything ready to eat.",

I think these people are very fortunate that they're one of few Asian places open this late at night. I would NEVER come here again. Our first entree came out exactly 17 minutes before the rest. Tom yum soup was flavored straight from the packet with no extra seasonings. Yellow curry was sugary sweet even though I specifically asked if it was sweet or not, was told no. Hoi jor or whatever it's called had odd texture to the wrapping. We almost walked out bc our food took so long. Asked to send back yellow sugar curry, but their cheap , shady mgr or owner perhaps, refused. You can go through my other reviews, I have never laid into an establishment enough to call them cheap or shady but this place is horrible unless you're as drunken as the noodles on the menu. I've also maybe one other time in my left not left a tip, this makes two. In 37 years. Came in with two starving teenagers, this is how much food we had left on our plates. Actually, nm, I felt bad and gave a tip after all, its not the poor waitress' fault the food sucks.",

I thought the Thai iced tea was a bit steep ($3.95) but then he brought it out and it was larger than I expected. Still a bit pricey, but worth it for a nice big glass of heaven.

They let you order your dish's spice level 0-10. I can eat spicy but a 1 spice level had a big kick.  We ordered -Hoi Jar (not bad, sweet sauce was good) -Crab Rangoon (rarely any crab meat) -Tom Yum Soup with chicken (Chicken was really dry, soup had excellent flavor) -Pad Thai (tasty and savory) -Pineapple Fried Rice (not the best one I've had) -Drunken Noodle (has a nice kick and depth, but was ok) -Yellow Curry (not too bad, a little bland) -Mango Sticky Rice (was really good for the price) -Thai Tea were huge! You can add tapioca too.  All the entree was mostly priced under $9-10! Which I thought was a great deal for the portion and quality!",

The location itself is relatively compact, especially in comparison to a standard restaurant, but make no mistake - this is restaurant quality food. The menu is concise yet carries enough variety to give the quintessential consumer enough to chew on (literally). The pictures are deceiving; don't be fooled, although the menu items seem rationed to small portions, the dishes are surprisingly plentiful. My boyfriend and I ordered the DRUNKEN NOODLES and the BASIL CHICKEN. Both were GREAT. I've only had Thai food twice prior to this and can say this was by far the best quality yet.   Summary: Considering we walked in with raging appetites and parted from the restaurant with leftovers, I would say that the food was more than satisfying in terms of portion and taste. Overall a great experience. Oh, by the way, they deliver for only about $3 to your hotel ($20 minimum).",

The food is so tasty and you even get to choose how hot/spicy you want your food on a scale from 1-10, allowing to please all tastebuds and members of the crowd.  The menu has a great selection of Thai salads, rice dishes, soups and noodle dishes and each dish allows your choice of meats, even tofu or vegetables if you're vegetarian/vegan. We've tried a bit of everything and have never been disappointed!   They also serve delicious Thai/bubble tea with or without boba/tapioca balls.   And every time we've been there, we've been met with genuine smiles and excellent service.  Please go there - you won't regret!",

We got this with chicken and tofu and it's stir fried with a red curry paste and every bite has the most flavorful lemongrass kick to it.

Neon orange crunchy candy coated fried chunks of chicken.  If that is your type of thing with a bowl of white rice, then you'd be in heaven.    Pad See Ew - also pretty good here.  Of course we had to get everything with spice level 0 for the kid but the ingredients all had good texture and felt fresh.

I've also had the Thai Iced Tea both times, once with boba, and with or without it's great.   The service is also awesome, very friendly, and quick! Both times I've been the restaurant was slow, which was nice because it is small. But hopefully for their sake it picks up, it's certainly worth the popularity. In any case, they seem friendly and ready to grow, so I'm sure no matter how busy it is the service will remain quality.

Same order I paid $65 for at my normal place was over $90 at this place.   My crispy egg rolls were soggy.   The dumplings I requested fried crispy were also soft and soggy.   Thai tea was way too strong.   Curry dish was ok but a little bland.   Chicken dish was thrown away. No one would eat it.   Fried rice tasted old.   Even the dessert - sticky rice with mango - was lacking. How do you mess up rice and fruit?! Well the rice was over cooked and mushy and the fruit wasn't what I'd call ripe.   Worst value for the money I've experienced in quite a while.",

OK I will take the order with no wrap, but wait theres more the beef was raw and not cut up correctly long fat pieces with gristle, Strange the menu pictures and decor dont match the substandard food coming thru the window!

    "text": "Khao soiiiiiiii!!! Been searching for a spot that compares to the khao soi I had in Chiang Mai! None came close, but this place is probably the most tasty I've tried yet.   When you try Thai food in its motherland, it's pretty difficult to find a place that satisfies your Thai tooth here in America! I don't know if it's nostalgia, or the craving for authenticity that draws me into Thai spices...other than the pure fact that Thai spice is inherently addicting to my existence! When youve had an amazing sexy bowl of khao soi in northern Thailand, you're hooked! And there's not many places that serve that heart warming noodle dish!   Thai st cafe comes close! I'm all about the drumstick to maintain authenticity and of course the flavorful broth! This joint meets the standard! Pretty yummy! I actually cannot stop thinking about how it made me feel every time that spoon and chopstick of goodness entered my mouth!   What I will dock off a star for is an unfortunate matter! MANGO STICKY RICE! I'm the largest fan of withholding the coconut milk! Just too much sweetness! The sweetness and sticky ness of the rice is more than enough. Butttt...I asked for the coconut milk on the side, and it came out drenched  and the sever insisted that it's for flavor! So I politely asked for just the sticky rice and mango. An unbelievably disappointing event happened after that! The rice was hard as a rock! And had zero flavor! I see why they drench it in coconut milk. I couldn't even enjoy it and it truly bummed me out!   In conclusion, no mango sticky rice to be enjoyed for me at this establishment, but I will come Back for that khao soi!",

Everything authentic and very reasonably priced. Menu is extensive and truly caters to every thai taste. We snacked on crispy rolls and crab rangoon which were both delicious. The food came and portions are plenty! I had the basil fried rice with shrimp. Everything was absolutely fabulous. Don't be afraid to venture off the strip for this place. Lyft can drop you off right at the door!   We asked about alcohol with dinner, and unfortunately they do not serve alcohol. However, our server Phil (who was fabulous) mentioned that they're BYOB and that there was a liquor store next door if we wanted to go get a 6 pack and bring it back! Perfect!

I did feel bad because we went about 30 minutes before they closed...and there were no other patrons in the restaurant. We told the server we can leave if they'd rather close up shop, but he reassured us that we can stay for as long as we wanted. He made us feel welcome and comfortable even if they were working on Christmas and they were technically supposed to be closing.

Anyways whatever down to the part you came to look at reviews for  THE FOOD: it's a 8/10 I've tried a bunch of different things from crab fried rice, curry, pad Thai, pad see ew, eggplant and many more. I think the only complaint I have about some of the things I've tried was the pork ribs they were like beef jerky it was a weird texture so I could eat more then one bite and the pad see ew some days it super good some days it's dry and weird tasting. So kinda a hit and miss..   Would I go back? Heck yeah lol food is a little pricey I mean each plate is like 9 and up but it's a good place to eat when I work so close. The parking is kinda weird it's in a strip club area and the massage places that kinda are sketchy. I wouldn't go at night alone. So be careful.  Oh the THAI TEA and THAI COFFEE is uhhmaze!!! But fatty. Lol",

We had a hair in one of our dinners and told two of the staff and they laughed and asked if we wanted a box  On the positive: 1. Food is yummy 2. People are kind 3. Very affordable   Hence my mixed review- I really enjoyed my dinner just not the experience.",

    "text": "I heard about this place from friends- it's not an area I usually venture out to, but I was intrigued by the idea of Thai street food in Vegas. Unfortunately, aside from the wraps, they have a pretty standard menu.  THAI CHICKEN WINGS: Good flavor in the sauce but otherwise a bit on the dry side, price was okay for the portion but this didn't stand out as something I'd get again. CRYING TIGER WRAP: grilled sliced beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, mint, cilantro, and rice wrapped in a tortilla with a spicy lime sauce. I really enjoyed the sauce and the tender meat, but there was no rice in my wrap. It was mostly stuffed with lettuce, which made it lighter than the burrito-esque food I was expecting.  Staff was friendly when I went to pick up my order. They did inform me that the curries were popular, and they were likely removing the wraps from the menu. Despite the seedy area, the interior was nicely decorated with dark wood and large color photos of Thailand street markets. Disappointed that they don't actually have anything resembling street food here.  NOTE: Pricing is a little high for the area, such as $10 for an entree without rice (additional $3) and all apps seem to be about $8. Not super high or anything, just not consistent with expectations for Industrial Rd.",

More noteworthy, they proceeded to argue with me, about the order being a pickup order.  They argued SO much I politely decided to cancel the order.  This is terrible customer service.  Of particular note is that they still have not refunded my money.  They charged me,  did not deliver, and did not credit my card for the canceled order.  Thus, the item is now disputed.  I would not do any business with this restaurant , the service is extremely poor and apparently they engage in criminal behavior.",

The staff is super friendly and isn't pushy at all. Everything is made to order and you can taste the freshness. I haven't had the opportunity to come in for their lunch specials but their normal portions are very generous and worth the prices so I can only imagine the lunch portions being plentiful and decently sized as well.",

The food was well seasoned, cooked nicely, and came out very quickly. I'm excited to try their other items and their menu is diverse but not overwhelming. The size was very fair for the price point.   Service - service was a bit slacking here but what service I did get was pleasant and nice. I requested no onions on my dish but it showed up with onions... oh well. lol but it wasn't so bad to the point that I wouldn't come back.

We had to split into two groups, at two separate tables since we didn't want to wait for one big table, and that's fine. It looked like it wasn't to busy, but almost all the tables were packed.  Food: OMG... Don't get the spicy food here. It was so spicy and my family and I eat spicy. They will ask you how hot you want it from a 1-10 scale, w/o warning you how spicy 10 is. We ordered the drunken noodles with chicken at a level 8, thai basil at a level 8 as well and both were so spicy for all of us, we could not eat more than three bites with rice. It The only good dish that we were able to eat was the yellow curry dish. That dish wasn't bad at all and it had a good amount of flavor. Again, only order spicy level of 6 or below.   Service: They need more employees. Seriously the food was not coming out at the right time together and they kept mixing the items we ordered with our other table. There was a group of maybe 8 that had been seated for a while before us and they were just getting their food when we finished ordering. They did not give us our glasses of water for so long! And they are so bad with refills. Oh and beware, they run out of boat noodles and young coconuts sometimes... Like how they did with us. One of the waiters did not know this and turned in an order for a boat noodle for my aunt and we had to confirm with the other waiter that there was no more boat noodles. WHAT THAI RESTAURANT RUNS OUT OF BOAT NOODLES?!?!?!  Price: The prices aren't bad. But the amount given does not equate to the price.  Overall, I would not return due to their customer service. Seriously need to hire more employees and have them pay attention to customers more.",

My boyfriend and I ordered their Thai dumplings, shrimp fried rice, and their chicken panang curry. The Thai dumplings were just perfect. They came out steamed and I love the sauce that it came with. It was like a sweater soy sauce. We couldn't finish the shrimp fried rice with its big portion and the curry too.

We ordered one with tapioca which cost $1 extra and there wasn't much tapioca in the drink, and one was free because we had an order of $25 or more. But at the end we got 3 Thai Teas, which I wasn't sure why, but was happy. I did request half sweet and no ice on both drinks, but all 3 had ice and it tasted full sweet. When we received our drinks they were wrapped in a plastic bag because I guess they did't want it to spill when the driver was driving... but sadly the drink still spilled and leaked as well. The tapioca was hard and not chewy or soft, so I don't recommend it unless the batch that night was made bad.  Overall the food was great and I 10000% love their Thai Milk Tea. I don't think I can find one as good in Canada.",

So we looked up the nearest restaurant de      Cafe what's the closest one so we decided to give it a try when we arrive at the place we were all in shock me when you look around all you see is mostly adult adult entertainment and other stuff but High St., Cafe was located right in the middle which was interesting so we still decide to give it a try we went inside we where impressed by the Decore, you look very nice and modern and I decide to order pod Thai shrimp my cousin ordered the yard the drunken noodle yeah the service was real good",

In their defense, the food could possibly be amazing but I would never know because they never delivered it--after an hour and 45 minute long wait. AND, what makes it worse is that I had to call them (three of my calls went to a busy signal) four times and once I was able to reach a live person, all they did was apologize, offer another half hour wait and promise a discount of 15% off on the next order...of which there will not be one. It could be the low blood sugar from not having eaten and waiting so damn long, but this experience is enough to make me not only write this review but to never even give this place a second chance.",

So for decor - I give it 5 stars.  Service was good - 4 stars for that.   The most important thing is the food. I give that 1 star.  I am extremely disappointed.  I don't know what people think authentic thai food is!!! Why does this place get the reputation of being authentic? I don't need to try everything on the menu. They should be able to cook every dish right. It's my first time here and it is also my last...   I ordered curry puffs, chicken eggplants, boat noodles soup.  Curry puffs were good. Chicken eggplants was bland.  Boat noodles soup was so bad I don't know why it's so bad!! It doesn't even taste like noodles soup!!   After the food was served, the waiter checked for satisfaction. I told her about the soup. She offered something else so I ordered chicken chili mint. They screwed that dish up too... It was bland and hardly had any basil leaves in it. I left the full order on the table untouched. No Togo box needed for that!",

They obviously have never had authentic Thai food and this place is nowhere close to it.  Thai boat was the worst ever. It was so sweet, it tasted like sugar. There's no balance at all and it was hard to finish, even added lime and spice couldn't save it.   Tom yum soup was totally watered down. Couldn't believe they called this tom yum.   The pork spare ribs was extremely salty and very DRY. It wasn't braised or cooked to tender as I expected and it should've been.   Beef Pad Thai- you can't go wrong with it. But it was wrong. The beef was extremely chewy like rubberband and the cut was so thick. The sauce was lacking and barely any flavor.   Only thing was good was fried tilapia fish. But then again you can fry a tilapia dish at home and it'll taste good. A 10 year old can cook this dish.  As for service, there was none because everything took so long. Probably because there was only one server and there was one other table.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Maybe if you're drunk then everything bad tastes good right?",

Delivery charge only $4 (mandatory for hotel delivery), but they delivered it to my room (AWESOME!). Definitely recommend, and get the Chicken salad if you're looking for something light, filling, and healthy! (Tom Kha soup could have been better!)  As far as spice, maybe get 6 if you like it spicy!

After I made an order, Thai St Cafe said that they are very busy so that will take one and a half hour to fulfill the delivery, and I agreed with that. However, I didn't get my food after 1.5 hours so I check through the app, the restaurant then updated order status to \"out for delivery\". After waiting for more then 2 hours, nothing came at all!!! I contacted eat24, their customer services called the restaurant and this restaurant said that they \"have some issue and not able to fulfill my order\". WTF? If you are not able to fulfill my order, you can call me at the beginning, instead of asking me to wait for 2+ hours, and telling a lie that you are out for delivery! I might not be able to comment the taste, as I am blocked from eating it, but I definitely will not recommend a dishonest restaurant.",

    "text": "This review is for my delivery order about 2 weeks ago. I came back from a night out and chose to order from Thai St Cafe instead of another Thai place because they were just across the street (I was at Treasure Island) and figured they would get to me faster.   So at 3:20 AM, I placed an order for 2 Pad See Ew Noodles and 1 Young Coconut to meet the delivery minimum, totaling to $27.21 (+$5 delivery fee). So the waiting began.   I called once and texted twice for updates, and it turns out that even though I was just across the street, there was another order before me that was far away, so they decided to drop that one off first! So my order finally got to me at 4:20 AM, when everyone else I was with was asleep. The delivery guy called me before he was even there, so I ended up waiting in the lobby for 5 more minutes. He took out a wad of cash and strangely offered me two dollar bills.......huh? And I was really confused and just told him to keep it.  The food was barely warm and there was no microwave in my hotel room. The beef was so dry that I ended up just eating the noodles and leaving everything else, and throwing out the second Pad See Ew. And they forgot the coconut!! I called them the next day to try to get a refund for the whole order, and they refused to refund anything. As for the coconut that they didn't even give me, they gave me the run-around and told me to email Eat24, who would email them.  I just can't believe I paid almost $30 for basically half a disgusting lukewarm Pad See Ew, and that it cost $5 and one hour to deliver it across the street! I would only recommend this place upon my worst frenemies. No matter what my friends say next time, I am only going to Marilyn's Cafe for late night food -- $5 steak and eggs!!",

Pretty seamless process. Some dishes had photos.   2. Price was absolutely comparable to local non-tourist places.  $9-$14  3. Delivery was fast and ahead of time. They delivered exactly to where we requested.   4. For being a late night place, the quality of the food was  surprisingly delicious. We were so thankful that something else was available that wasn't pizza or sandwiches.  Highly recommend!!!",

I am half Thai and was excited to try this place and surprised I didn't hear about it. Well, no wonder. It took like 15min for her to come to our table to order drinks. She didn't write anything down and I was nervous but she did remember everything. Everything tasted like frozen food. No special or unique flavors. I tried a different soup, Kao Soy soup, than I usually get at other places, Tom Kha, but was very disappointed. They didn't ask us what spice level so everything was really plain. The Thai iced tea was really tall so luckily we only got one. The coconut water might've been the best thing. The place is nice-looking inside though.",

The ongoing issue I have is that my order is wrong 99% of the time I get delivery. If first impressions are everything to you, I suggest dining in to appreciate what they have. They will forget to include something or take something out if requested. My orders are never large, usually two entrees and maybe a thai tea, so I don't understand how it can happen so often. They are extremely professional when it comes to making sure the order is right, which I really appreciate! But I don't want to wait another 30mins for food when it could be made right the first time. I always tip the driver nicely, even twice for making a double trip to fix my order.

It was a big portion and presented nicely considering it was only 8 bucks I think? It came on a wooden square with a heat source underneath to keep the soup nice and hot. It was the perfect temperature for me since I have a cough and cold at the moment. There was an evenly distributed amount of chicken and vegetables which I appreciated because I feel like it's never like that. I got it mild and the amount of spice and flavors were on point.

Located in the middle of two strip clubs, next door to a liquor store, we were not sure if this is really the place we wanted to eat, but there were some amazing reviews and we just had to peep in - after all we had walked nearly 4 miles to get here..   Once inside the place was empty, maybe it was 2 pm on a workday and people had already had lunch, or maybe people were busy at CES, but the place looked warm and nice, and the staff courteous. It was clean, very beautifully done so me and my wife sat down and we ordered some food.  For my Wife we ordered Mixed Vegetable Thai Rice, and for me a Hot Pot with Sea Food, all we can say is that this is the Best thai food we have ever eaten, yes better than the one you get in the most genuine thai places, or even bangkok.. the food was delicious, and served wel.  The portions were large, and we had great company from the team. I eventually also requested for the Chef to come and join us as we wanted to personally thank him. A lovely place and a must do.",

They're always very friendly and if you have an aching for great Thai food, come here. They're also very fast at prep. You can dine-in, take out, and they deliver. Near the strip, so if you're just visiting I say stop by :) BONUS: they have Thai tea (when you check in you can get one free) and Thai coffee. They'll even add boba upon request.",

    "text": "Not in the best area in town, but once you enter, it feels safer, although the decor is more contemporary than Thai.  No alcohol,  but you can buy from Liquor store next door and drink in here...but get twist off beers, for the have no bottle openers,  and it not legal for them to open with no liquor license.   The appetizers were mediocre, we had Chicken Sate and Beef Jerky.  Sate was good, (but hard to mess that up), Jerky was dry.   We ordered Phad Thai and Drunken Noodles.  We had #5 on the spice meter, and it was way too spicy.  I think that was more of a 8 or 9.  We asked to have them replaced at #2, and they just added a bunch of vegetables to it instead.  Drunken Noodles was more of a Chop Suey. Last we had Thai Fried Rice, which was less than average.  For dessert, we tried the Ro Ti, since there were some exciting stuff written about it on Yelp.  Big disappointment.  It was like a flour tortilla with condensed milk and some cocoa powder.  The coconut ice cream was nothing special.  Then we got our bill and they charged us $3 extra for the vegetables they used to try to fix the noodle dishes, instead of just making new ones.   Still searching for my Thai place in Vegas.  Miss my Thai places in LA, and I don't think we will come back to this place..",

But this place looks nice when you walk in, the waitress was professional and friendly, the service good, and the food delicious.  We went about 2 pm, and were the only customers.  The chow mein was  great, all fresh ingredients.  Likewise, the mixed vegetables with shrimp was scrumptious.  Egg rolls... best I ever tasted.  Food presentation was perfect.  I pictured a professional chef working in the back.  In summary, one star for the location, but five for the restaurant (which we found on yelp).",

Luckily, the restaurant itself is inviting and has a spunky vibe to it. Our server was about a 75% on attentiveness, so not terrible overall. Menu was pretty inexpensive and had all your typical Thai dishes. We liked every dish we ordered but was less than impressed with the mango sticky rice. Bummer as we are big dessert people, but understandable since mangoes aren't in season. Would definitely come back, just maybe during an earlier time of day next time.",

I also ordered the chicken satay and it was tender and succulent . The three ladies joining me also enjoyed their meals thoroughly : the crying tiger wrap, Thai style sweet and sour chicken and basil chicken.

I thought maybe thai food in vegas is better than in LA. It wasn't too far from our hotel which was perfect plus they closed at 4 am.  We arrived at the restaurant, it was pretty hidden in a small plaza. As we went into the restaurant, it was empty with not even one customer inside. So we sat down. The server was really nice.   I order the usual thai dishes I would order in LA which are pad thai shrimp and tom kha soup. I also ordered Thai Tea. Our food took a little long to come out but it was fine. The thai tea was really good. I enjoyed it but when we got out food. The tom kha soup was way too sweet in my opinion. It just didn't taste like the tom kha soup that I usually eat. It taste like sweet soup. The pad thai noodles were thin noodles and also too sweet. Pretty disappointed. Maybe I came at the wrong time.   Though it's not the best thai restaurant I've been to but the atmosphere is nice and their thai tea is really good.",

Lovely ambiance, nice wood paneled walls with tasteful artwork. Super friendly staff that provide excellent recommendations and provide great service. The food was fantastic. We ordered Pork Larb, Tom Kha soup, eggplant, and Pad See Ew. All were excellent, especially the soup and eggplant. Topped it all off with a big Thai iced tea. Overall, the best meal we had in Vegas, and a great little place to escape the sensory overload, cigarette smoke, and constant noise of the strip. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Alright, here's my 411 based on my take out order and pick up via Eat24 on Yelp.   I was craving thai curry last night while studying, and Thai St Cafe showed up nearest on my yelp search. It was during a study session so I wanted to do take out and get my thai curry as quickly as possible.  This is when I first discovered that Eat24 was available on their yelp page! YES! I love having my orders ready for pick up.  So for the ordering process, I clicked on \"Order Pick Up or Delivery\" which led me to their menu with thumbnail pictures next to the name of each item. Their Panang curry was labeled with a star, so I figured that was a popular choice right? So I added 2 of the Panang Curry items, added Chicken, No Spice level, and from there I reviewed my order and checked out. A confirmation email was sent immediately showing me the approximate time of when my order would be done. The ease of ordering thru yelp was a 5/5.   I quickly drove to the place because, obviously I was that hungry that I arrived inside Thai St Cafe 10 minutes from the estimated order completed time. The woman behind the cash register welcomed me and told me my order would be completed soon and sure enough, it was done 5 minutes earlier than expected! The pick up process was easy and quick. And the customer service was great! Even a worker from the back bringing silverware to the front asked me how everything going.  I can say the inside of Thai St Cafe was definitely a lot more cleaner and decoratively designed than the area it's located in. I was impressed! Anyway, the pang curry came with rice and it was SO FULFILLING! My cravings has never been so satisfied. It was rich and I understood why there was a gold star next to its name on the menu list. This place is definitely a hidden gem and I recommend it to all food lovers! One of my friends also compliments their Pad Thai to the max, so try it out!",

    "text": "Great little hole in the wall and a great find just a couple of minutes off the strip.  It's very small. It has about 6-8 tables(?) Half of them being 2-tops.   We arrived right during the lunch right during the lunch rush.  So it filled up immediately. There was just one person covering all tables along with take out orders, and I thought she handled it fairly well for someone that was obviously slammed.  So in regards to considering that, it was good service.  I would just advise to avoid rush hours of you're in a rush or call ahead for take out.  We had the pad thai shrimp and red curry with chicken.  I absolutely loved the red curry.  I love spicy food and the level of spice was just the amount I love for that tingle but not so much that you've lost all other flavors.  It balanced the savoriness of the cocounut.  The pad thai was delicious as well and pretty stabdard to what I expect good pad thai to be.    The prices were reasonable and so were the portion sizes in relation to it's cost.   I'm from out of town but visit Vegas regularly.  I'd definitely return.",

    "text": "Nice Thai restaurant behind the strip next to a nail salon. I've been here twice. Once during the Christmas weekend and another time last week. During the Christmas weekend, it was PACKED. I mean so crowded that people were waiting outside and inside to get a table. It was maybe a 30-40 minute wait depending on the size of your party (we had 3 in our group). I didn't care for the egg rolls/spring rolls (veggie ones) because they tasted like they're frozen. The veggies inside were mushy. However, my actually main dish was good. I believe I had the spicy basil both occasions I went. (I like ordering the same item once I know it delicious) I'm vegetarian and of course Thai food is very vegetarian friendly. The second time I went, I placed an order over the phone was asked about the spicy level of both items. The wait was about 20 mins which was fine. However, when I went inside to pick up my items, I saw maybe 5 people. Two waiting for their phone orders and the others sitting at the tables eating. So some nights are insane and others are really quiet and calm. Either way, I only had one real complaint because I don't like when food taste as if it was frozen and then deep fried. Also medium is spicy!! If you don't like heat, get mild. Definitely recommend to someone who wants food off the strip.",

We got pineapple fried rice, yellow curry, and the Tom kha soup. I like my food with a little kick but not too spicy so we got every entree a level 2 (out of 10) which is considered \"mild.\" I wish I had gotten a 4 or 5 because to me everything just tasted too sweet.

The bathrooms were also very clean and the staff is helpful and very friendly. We ordered Thai dumplings, Thai Fried Rice, Pad Woon Sen, and Mango Sticky Rice. I loved the flavors of the Pad Woon Sen. The mango sticky rice was by far my favorite. It is not too sweet, the rice was slightly warm and the mango were ripe and sweet. The Thai Ice Tea was also phenomenal. It had a flowery note and was not too sweet. Overall it was one of the best Thai meals I have ever had. I highly recommend this place!!!",

My coworkers and I went today during our lunch hour and besides taking our order and giving us water, we did not receive any other service...including our food.  After an hour, we had to ask them to box up our food because our lunch hour was up.  No apology.  They even charged more for one of our meals and my coworker had to argue for the correct price.  We used to come here a lot because we wanted to support a local business near our office.  The food is usualy good but the service always seems to decline each time.  Today was the worst!  Yes it is Christmas and yes it was busier than I've ever seen it but an hour wait for our food without even a hint of an apology was the last straw.  The worst part is that they had a toddler (literally a toddler!) bussing tables, collecting payment, and giving people their food/drinks. I would not be sad if this restaurant went out of business.  I will defnitely not be supporting it since they obviously do not appreciate my patronage.",

    "text": "I had a 3am hankering for Thai food and Thai St Cafe came through for me! I called in my order and they were ready for me 15 minutes later. They also deliver with a $15 minimum order. I got:  - Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao): 3 stars. While there is definitely depth and layers of flavor here, the sauce relied a little too heavily on the oyster sauce, in my opinion. It needed a little more fish and dark soy sauces, I thought. They stir fry the noodles with bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms. (Tomatoes and mushrooms have no place in traditional pad kee mao, but they weren't bad here.) The chicken in the dish was marinated spectacularly and not dry. This dish was also flaming hot, but I'll address that below. - Yellow Curry: 4 stars. Thank you, thank you, thank you Thai St Cafe for not making your curries overly sweet. This was exactly what I expect from a good curry. The pork was executed well, and all of the vegetables were cooked perfectly. Of course, the curry comes with rice. No complaints here.  About the spice levels. I have no idea how their system works. I ordered the noodles at a level 7 and the curry at a level 5, and there was a huge, HUGE difference between the two. The curry was very mild, while the noodles were the spiciest thing I have ever eaten. I see a lot of reviews noting that the drunken noodles are very spicy, and I'm thinking it has to do with the particular types of chilies that they incorporate into the dish. But holy moley, it was HOT. Not the type of spice that gets your nose running and feels like warmth, but the type of spice that burns on contact, makes your tongue tingle, and makes the restroom an uncomfortable experience. I was literally yowling in reaction to the heat. I'd be very curious to see what it would be like at a level 5; I'm guessing it would still be much hotter than the level 5 curry. If I were to order these two again, I would do the curry at a level 8 and the drunken noddles at a level 4 or 5.  Good, real Thai food available late at night! I won't be surprised if i find myself here again!",

And I must say, they may have gotten 4 stars if I stayed using take out instead of sitting in.   The only dish that I have tried here is their drunken noodles. They use mushrooms in theirs, which is different from the other Thai places that I've tried. The overall flavor of their drunken noodles is very good as well. It just meshes so well together. It reminds me of a pad see ew spin off. It has a tiny bit of sweet to it and it would taste especially good when I got it spicy. I usually get a level 10 spicy.   On my most recent visit, my boyfriend and I decided to go for dinner because I was craving for their drunken noodles. We got there at around 545pm so it wasn't busy at all. The dinner rush hasn't started. There was maybe about 2-3 tables aside from us. But the service was so slow throughout the night.   I ordered drunken noodles with chicken while my boyfriend ordered their pad see ew with beef. It took a while for the dishes to come out and when it did, they decided to give me shrimp instead of chicken. So I had to get them to re-do the dish. I also had to ask for chopsticks twice and even then, we had to get up to go to the register to even get it cause they forgot about it. They never refilled our waters. And when it was time to pay, I just took it to the register myself instead of waiting for them to grab my card. At that time, there was only one table aside from us. I just don't understand why it's so slow.   I'll definitely go back for their drunken noodles but I'll only do take out or delivery. I don't think I can sit down at their establishment again. Plus, parking sucks so I rather just grab and go anyhow.",

Yeah, it's in the shopping center that was featured on a show about an undercover sting operation to bust pimps who have their offices here, but the restaurant is fine. Parking is tight, but they have the cheapest delivery minimum in and around the Spring Mountain area for Asian food.  I've ordered take out, pick up & eaten in house here. Portions are on the smaller side but non seafood entrees run between $7-10.   The restaurant is clean and modern. Wait staff was attentive and the food is good.   Honestly, if you order online, your food will be much spicier (I order 10/10) when they can't make snap judgements about me like what happens at every Asian restaurant.  Ordering spice level vs actual spice level:  9/10 in house = 3. 10/10 online = 10. One time it was more like a 15, but that was only one of many orders I've placed here.  Will return.",

Sorry but I am not a savage and don't eat with my fingers.  I asked for Chile sauce on the side and didn't get it either.  You don't have to accommodate me but at least give me one chopstick or something!  PLEASE READ!!! HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF PURPLE MEAT??  I posted a picture of it below and it came with the beef chow mein.   I've never asked for my steak to be purple so I don't know standards they hold at this restaurant. I ordered the crab/pork fried ball and it had pink in it. The pad Thai was NOT flavorful.  Waste of money and hope I don't get food poisoning.",

It's located in a seedy area of town with strip clubs all up and down the street, what do you expect from Vegas. I ordered from the super friendly waiter my favorite dish Chicken Pad Thai. They have heat levels 1 through 10, I asked for 7, just in case it wasn't too hot. The food was delicious, it was so delicious I brought my wife and daughter the next evening for dinner, my wife ordered heat level 8. Both of them are picky eaters and they loved the food.",

Had I known that earlier I'd be having most of my meals here!   Location is nestled in a strip mall on industrial way.  If you're not careful, you will miss it.  At first I was like, \"Why are we going to the Adult sex stores?\" ... I want food, not toys!    Place: Clean and light.  Modern furniture. Clean bathroom (So important).   Food: Yummy!  Spice levels from 1-10.  I got the boat noodle with a level 7 spicy and extra chili on the side.  I also got the wings with a level 8 spicy.  Both dishes were delicious.  My girlfriend got the Drunken noodles and the egg rolls (no meat in these egg rolls).  She swears both were yum!    Service:  Was good.  Sweet young little girls.  Very nice and attentive.  Place was not very busy when we arrived (off hours).    Yes I'll be returning to this place on my Vegas visits.  This is my 2nd favorite Thai place! Woot woot!",

We were seated immediately.   Their menu wasn't super big. They had around 7 dishes for each category, such as appetizers, main dishes, soups, and desserts. We ordered the Thai Iced Coffee and Young coconut. Oh my lord, the thai coffee was sooooo amazing! It was really sweet, but they warned us beforehand and we still got it. It kind of taste like coffee and thai tea. The young coconut actually came in a coconut, not too sweet. We then ordered the pad thai and the drunken noodles. You can order the level of spice you want from a level of 1 to 10. We got the level 7 spicy for pad thai and it wasn't that hot.   The food didn't take long to come out. The pad thai was very tasty and flavorful. It wasn't dry at all, and it tasted even better with some lime squeezed on top. The drunken noodles were ok. It tasted very plain and it just tasted like regular chow fun noodles.  The price was ok too. The total came out to be around $28. And they're open until 4AM, so if you have the munchies, this place is great! It's kind of in a sketch area though...right next to a liquor store and a bunch of sex shops.",

We had the dumplings, shrimp pad Thai, and spicy basil chicken rice. We received our order very quickly. The reason not 4 or 5 stars is the waitress working had zero customer service skills, we had to ask for refills, we never received extra napkins as requested, she wasn't very helpful when we were ordering by making recommendations, and definitely not chatty or overly friendly and there was only one other party dining while we were there. The men's room was out of paper towels, and the wall next to our booth had food/sauce splattered all over it. I could work around the messy wall, but the no paper towels makes me wonder if the staff is washing their hands after using the bathroom, if so they should have noticed this.",

The only reason I've docked them a couple stars is because they need to work on their service when not taking out. When we sat in and dined, they got our order wrong, then charged us for the item on the check. It was fixed, but otherwise that, the service was still kind of slow and not very attentive. I believe they forgot to give us chopsticks when we asked for a couple as well, and someone else had to bring them. Pretty sloppy.  Still, this place is worth going to if you're in the area - though it's kind of out of the way in a seedy area of town. It really doesn't fit in with its plaza.",

The noodles were good, but the meat was tough, full of grizzle, pretty much inedible. The Shrimp Pad Thai was good, nothing spectacular.

I was craving hot pot after the club and wanted to go somewhere close to the Wynn. Luckily we stumbled upon this place and it was close enough for us to walk to. Please be aware that the road to get here is incredibly sketchy and it's also located in a very sleazy plaza next to Gan Gan Room which is a strip club.   Either way, you can't miss it. The place has got tons of neon lights and photos on the windows so it won't be hard to find.   Since I didn't get to have the hot pot, I defaulted to the pad see ew for $8.95. For the price, it's definitely a decent portion. I love that they put the chili seeds and hot sauce on the side so you can modify how hot you want your meal to be. Please note, these chili seeds are no joke!!  The restaurant has a very clean bathroom and they've also got cute decor of license plates from across the country. Overall I would certainly come back here since the service was great, I just wish they'd serve until 4am in-house!   (28/100 - 2018)",

It turned out saltier than I expected, and instantly started coughing after taking my first bite. The noodles and chicken weren't bad, but the overall taste was too salty for my liking.   The veggie made for a good display, since it made me felt like I was eating something healthier. Just make sure to not actually bite into the veggie as they were uncooked to the point where one could compare it to biting into one of those plastic display broccoli. (Definitely not speaking from experience)  TLDR: Open late. Delivery. Saltier than normal.",

Lol  After failing to get Thai food downtown due to rain and restaurant closure, we decided to check out this place that's on a popular street among several strip clubs.  We ordered family style and shared everything. We weren't sure how their spice levels would be so we opted for a milder spice level on the papaya salad which had no kick to it. Luckily the chef was okay remaking it with a little bit more thai chili and the second time was perfect.   The drunken noodles and Tom yum was flavorful and hit the spot. The Thai sausage was just okay, I think we were expecting more of a spicy herb flavor vs a sweet and pickled flavor? Overall food was good.  Service was a bit slow, they must've had only one server that night from what I can tell. We noticed a couple at a table waiting a while for a server so they just got up and left.",

Our waitress Bo was very attentive & fast when we came for dinner too.   The food was very authentic and there was a lot of variety on the menu. Very reasonably priced too. The crab Rangoon's, pad Thai, and pad see ew were all really good and came in big serving sizes.   I do agree with the other reviews about the spicy-ness... we ordered 5/10 and it still turned out really hot.   Overall I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good Thai food!

Service was nice but we had to wait a while for some hot water/ask 2 waiters for it. Not a huge staff the day we went and there were still people there with us at like 10pm. BE CAREFUL!  Ordered pad see ew, drunken noodles, basil fried rice and eggplant entree. All with choice of meat we got beef, chicken and pork. Everything was pretty tasty especially loved the basil fried rice and eggplant entree. The drunken noodles i wish were spicier but i think we asked for mild so it wouldn't kill our stomachs. My friend felt the pad see ew noodles itself were dry.",

We exactly know how everything looks and tastes. But, on that day everything was terrible. None of them had tofu, cashews or veggies. There was no salt no spices nothing. Pineapple Fried rice was just dipped in a bowl of Turmeric and served.  We asked what's the problem and they say nothing, this is how it's served always. To give them another chance, we ordered Coconut ice cream thinking it won't go wrong. Again, there were no fried cashews or coconut toppings on the top.  Terrible experience. My guess is the old chef has been replaced or the management has changed.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that my fiance is a U.S Air Force Disabled Veteran who served 20 years for our country and now suffers from PTSD. We found this restaurant on yelp after leaving the gym and seeing that they were open pretty late, we decided to go.  Upon arrival a little past 12am we were greeted at the door by a server who almost immediately stopped us and said no dogs could be in the restaurant. We informed her, my fiance's dog was a Service Dog. She then demanded a \"certificate\" for his service dog. We informed her that we didn't have to show anything to prove his dog is a service dog.  She then told us she wouldn't seat us because she had other customers in the restaurant, again we informed her that she couldn't deny him service for his disability. She continued to ask for this certificate and then said she had to call her manager to ask if they could serve us due to having a service dog.  We told her to call whoever she was going to call but she didn't.  My fiance advised her of the Americans with Disabilities Act that states service animals are allowed in restaurants and he can't be denied service due to my his disability. She then said \"I've lived here for a long time, I know the laws\". We asked for her name or mangers name...she refused both.  My fiance service dog has gone through extensive training to assist him with his medical needs and is no different than a person who can't can't walk needing a wheelchair.  We are completely appalled at this woman's actions. A respectable and honorable disabled veteran should never be denied service for his disability nor for having a service dog.  A couple of police officers happen to be outside and my fiance spoke to them about the incident.  One of the police officers went inside the restaurant to pretty much educate her on serving an individual who has a service dog.  When the police officer returned he advised us that the woman inside stated that she didn't refuse service and that she going to seat us.  A complete lie from her......We urge all fellow yelpers to not support this type of establishment!  We will also be taking this to our local news.",

I ordered online and when I got there to pick up the food, first thing I noticed walking in was how cute the place was. It's small but the tables are spaced out very well.  We had to wait a few minutes since it wasn't ready but that wasn't a problem at all. We got the Thai tea with boba. Oh my gosh. First sip and I thought I was just drinking sugar. I know all places make Thai tea different so I always expect it's either a hit or miss. With that in mind, I just thought I could just water it down a little, no big deal. Then I got to the boba, and now I'm regretting the entire drink. It was the hardest boba I've ever had. I worked at a boba shop a while back so I know that their boba was not even close to being cooked. They were very understanding and friendly about it though. They just remade the Thai tea without boba and gave us an extra one. I didn't really care for more super sweet tea, but that was sweet of them.   I got the beef salad and the beef was just chewy. And it was more sour than having that spicy, salt, and lime balanced taste. I didn't even make a dent in my beef salad. I ate more of the plain white rice I ordered on the side.   The boyfriend ordered their crab rangoons and those were really good. It had an extra taste to them compared to all the other crab rangoons I've tried.   Even tho I wasn't a fan, I do plan on giving them another try. Maybe dining in next time will be better.",

I started with an order of Hoi Joi. It looked great on the menu but the flavor was rather bland and the whole dish was forgettable. I wish I had ordered a different starter.   For my main dish I ordered the Panang Curry which after the Hoi Joi was incredible and redeemed the place. The flavor was robust and hardy. There was a great amount of chicken and vegetables. I ordered a 3 out of 10 level spicy. I usually eat spicier but this was a nice even level for lunch, not too spicy but present.   I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great Thai food in a relaxed atmosphere.",

We ordered a meal at 12:20 pm. People came after us, had their meal and left. She did not inform us that the order will take long. When asked she said she is going by queue but a family that came after us was already eating. She said she will get us a papaya salad complimentary for the wait and finally served something at 1:15 pm. That's right, waited 55 minutes to get a papaya salad. RUDE STAFF, BAD FOOD, PATHETIC ATTITUDE. WE WALKED OUT OF HERE! I am pretty sure by the time we visit Vegas next this completely unprofessional place is going to go out of business for the terrible business that they conduct",

We ordered the food online through eat street and recieved a confirmation email from the restraunt stating our order will arrive in 45-50 mins. After waiting for 1 hour we tried calling the restraunt which was not reachable. When finally we got them, we were ensured that our food is on the way. After another 35 mins when we called back, we were told that our order is cancelled long time back. So we waited for almost 2 hours with no information and the restraunt guy was terrible in communication too..Never had such a worst night ..:Thanks to THAI ST CAFE",

    "text": "This place has one of my new favorite dishes. So while I've only eaten there one time, I had to share my experience with this new spot. They have a soup there, Boat Noodle Soup, where I can taste the richness of the bones and different parts simmered in the soup. It's got a unique, rich flavor that I haven't tasted in other restaurant broths. Okay in fairness, it doesn't have the same flavor profile of other Thai soups I had. But I know enough to know what I DON'T  know about Thai food. While I eat it regularly, I am no expert. What I DO feel expert in is identifying rich, flavorful stocks. And man, this soup is so good.   Yes, I tasted some other dishes and was pleased with everything I ate. The drunken noodle, wings, and basil fried rice were all nicely flavored and comprised of quality ingredients.  I wasn't as blown away by these dishes, but they were certainly solid.   I am heading back to  Thai St Cafe now for my second experience and plan to have a third very soon. I will update my review after having more than one experience with this small place. But after MANY disappointing Thai food experiences in this town, I was pleased to stumble on a place that is putting out tasty food and delivering it to boot. I'm always willing to give a Yelp score based on a single dish.  And that Boat Noodle Soup is a new go-to for me. Most places can't get one dish correct, let alone a homey and simple/complex soup.  So yeah, I'm a fan.  EDITED to ADD: Well, after two more bouts with the soup, mango, and noodles, I am changing my review. It was still tasty and I was pleased with my food, but the exceptional flavor profile just wasn't there. The soup, in particular, was less a subtle configuration of layered flavors, and more a warm, well-seasoned stock. Good--will be ordered again--but not exceptional.   It feels more like a consistency issue than a quality issue. I don't think one stumbles into soup as amazing as what they served me few months back. Two mediocre experiences out of three is a little disappointing. But I have a feeling about this place. I will be back. And I am hopeful.",

Only one other table (6 tops, max) and our table (4 adults and 1 child). Service was meh, I don't go to Asian restaurants and expect any type of service, they're not known for that. Ordered soft drinks and only the cans were brought out, no cup or glass of ice to go with the drinks. Food was mediocre. I don't get how people are raving about the food here. Maybe we came on an off day??? For appetizers, we had Hoi Jor and Chicken Wings. Both were okay, I think dim sum restaurants have them beat in that area. I was told the spicy level was 1-10 with 5 being medium. I ordered number 4 spice level for everything we ordered, and it felt like it was an 8. Server seemed not to care about that at all...anyways, continuing with the food...we did family style ordering so papaya salad, beef salad, crab fried rice, fried tilapia, short ribs, and drunken noodles. Everything was either bland, or tasted really off. The beef in the beef salad was so hard to pull apart and it was so chewy. Crab fried rice was tasteless. The only decent thing was the drunken noodles. We pretty much left more than half of the food there and left. Expressed our opinions to the server and she seemed to not care, so it is what it is. Will never step foot into this place again!",

The restaurant itself is gorgeous and the menus have pictures of everything (which is kinda cool since some places make the same dish in different ways). I tried the ground chili chicken as well as the beef and it was just bad, unfortunately. I bit into gristle on the second bite and couldn't have any more. There were string beans in the dishes that didn't go with the flavor, in my opinion. The worse part is that they didn't ask about our spice preference. The dish is supposed to be spicy in of itself, so I didn't really even think of it until I saw that it was ridiculously mild. Hot sauce wouldn't have fixed it. I took it to go for my husband, but even he ended up tossing it. The curry puffs, which I was excited to see on the menu, had a good crust, but the filling was terrible. Mostly tasted like mashed sweet potato. Way too sweet, no chicken to speak of and any curry flavor was masked by all the sweetness. The spring rolls were crispy but reminded me of the frozen ones from the grocery store. They had that odd, mushy interior and the flavor wasn't great. I don't think I'd go back here, sad to say.",

My husband was embarrassed to bring my mom here like \"Well, it wasn't me who yelped this place\"  The bottom line is, the food makes up for it all. I recommend Tom Ka (might not be the right spelling of the dish. It's a coconut soup) and bees noodle salad.   10!(?)10??",

I work across street and was dining here 2-3 times a week until the host of \"Dirty Dining\" walked in with her camera man to investigate the \"C\" health grade they had received and why it was not posted in the restaurant. Along with the cleanliness issues, the owner's cot for sleeping in the food storage room, unsafe food temperatures and plumbing issues this was their second appearance on the local show \"Dirty Dining.\" I would typically return after seeing physical changes and corrections however they have lost my trust after choosing not to post their lower health grade.   *Prior to their two mishaps, the food was amazing, so much that I would always order the dinner portion. It's open all hours of the night, services was a bit slow as I've only ever seen one cook but I was often there for the lunch rush so not a biggie for me especially since i work so close. I'm definitely dissapointed however if you can look past it then I recommend the yellow curry with tofu or shrimp or the seafood tom yum soup.",

They wouldn't take my order because I couldn't give them my cell number (I'm from Canada). They wouldn't accept the hotel number plus my room number either. I tried to order on the Yelp delivery but that wouldn't work either!  they really need to get there delivery system fixed and there phone.  We ended taking taxi here which sucked. Only came because my boyfriend really wanted too!   The restaurant was in a shady area but inside it was clean and open. Our server was polite and friendly. Food came out quick and the portions were big. We had the  hoi  jot (3/5 crispy but not much flavour just meat) , curry puff (2.5/5 crispy but the outside she'll was too thick and hard), spicy basil 7 spice (4/5), panang curry (4/5 the broth was nice and creamy lots of chicken and mixed veggies) and the Thai tea (5/5 rich and creamy perfect amount of sweet)   Overall the food and restaurant service was good but the delivery system sucks!!! I would have given 4/5 if I had it delivered.",

Only found out the bus stop was far away. We asked Alan and Apple for other easier ways to get to airport considering Uber/Lift not an option without carseat.

For my entree I ordered a shrimp pad Thai which was a good portion size. I had asked the shrimp to be cooked well-done as I sometimes have allergy issues to shellfish. It was definitely cooked well done but had a very distinct burnt smell not only in the shrimp but throughout the noodles. It was almost as if I was having smoked shrimp pad Thai which wasn't too tasty. Overall it was just an average experience.",

The location is clean and dark but relaxing. I had the chicken pad see ew and like I said it was delicious. I will for sure go again when I'm at work and also take my family to try it as well. Try it if you're looking to have a great Thai dish.  You will not be disappointed. If you are, well then we just might have different opinions about the place but as for me, I loooved everything about it.  Even the price is okay considering you're getting fresh and quality food.

Came on a Sun for lunch and it was empty.   For food we ordered the spring rolls, Kao soi and cashew nut chicken. The spring rolls were standard so worth getting if you like that.   Cashew nut chicken came out first. My bf always gets that so I've smoked a fair amount and this was up there.   Kao soi was a big bowl of yellow curry, a heaping amount of chicken and bean sprouts. The broth was really rich in flavor. Highly recommend this dish!",

If you list the ingredients on the menu then it should be in the dish. I also had to wait 24 minutes to get my beef salad. It took over 40 minutes to get my final 2 dishes, drunken chicken and larb. We had asked for medium spice for both dishes but instead got mild. My girlfriend said that she enjoyed the flavors of the dish. I agree, the dishes are good but one dimensional in flavor.   Thai food is built in layers. You add spices, chili, savory meats, and layer additional flavors by adding crushed peanuts, bean sprouts, cilantro, and mints. Eating each dish was like getting a good hamburger, bun, and cheese but leaving out the onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, mustard, and relish.   Considering the options in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend that you give this place a try.  It's worth a visit but don't expect to be blown away by authentic Thai flavors. Most of the flavor profiles you experience will have come from a bottle. Also, avoid this place if you are in any sort of a rush.",

Actually, you don't really need to stop because you can order delivery right from the Yelp app, and that's what I did last weekend, twice.  The delivery minimum is $20, which is easy to hit if you're ordering for two or more, or if you're like me and ordering for one, but it appears like you are ordering for two or more. What can I say, I love to eat.  For me, I always order the Phad Thai on the first go. If they have good Phad Thai, in my humble opinion, the rest of the menu usually goes over quite well. My first round I ordered that and the Panang Curry. The second delivery of the weekend consisted of the above, with the addition of Crab Rangoon.   Clearly the Phad Thai and Panang Curry were real winners, having ordered them twice in one weekend. The curry was rich and creamy and the chicken tender. The rice was served on the side and is just the right amount of sticky. The Phad Thai is like a spicy noodle hug. The Crab Rangoon? A well designed and mixed filling with a lightly browned and fried exterior. If you're not a fan of the sweet chili sauce they serve on the side, we can stay friends. I am an aggressive dipper and I need it all to myself.  The wait time for delivery can be a bit intense, 60-90 minutes, but just plan ahead. With it being Friday and all, perhaps I'll take my own advice and plan ahead for a round three.",

You may want to order a second order of rice though. The place is in a chill spot and it's quiet...at least for us on a Friday in September in Las Vegas so there's that. It hasn't happened yet but remember spicy going in...great customer service and I'll definitely go back.",

Be aware that the percentage of gratuity is not listed on the check.  Without checking it, we would pay at their whatever rate on the check.  It is not right to trick customers for tips this way!

We stopped by here and the plaza seemed really sketch lol, still didn't stop me from having thai food. We came here because of the reviews!   We did family style for the four of us so we could all share our food. I went super basic and played it safe. For appetizers I ordered the cream cheese wontons. Easily a good appetizer to start off with. It was perfect. I also ordered pad thai chicken, pad see ew beef, and the chow mein. The funny thing to me was that the waitress asked how spicy we wanted the food between 1-10, 10 being the spiciest. So I'm thinking 5, the dishes come out and they were really really good but super spicy!! I can't imagine what  a 10 would be~  WE honestly were pretty stuffed and oh yeah we also had satay! All the dishes were ordered that time were really delicious. I do recommending you getting their thai tea!! It was really good when I had it. It's a must try and a big size also!",

Plus their thai teas are huge AND delicious. By huge, I mean it's 2x more than what you'll get at other Thai restaurants. So worth it! For food, I got the pad thai with shrimp. They were generous with the shrimp and the pad thai was also very tasty.  Service was great as the ladies were attentive and made sure everything was okay. They even asked us if we liked our food while our mouths were happily stuffed with delicious goodness.  Definitely had a good meal here. Thai St Cafe is worth checking out! I even recommended it to my Uber driver on the way back to The Palazzo.",

The space is clean and smells of spices and foodie goodness.   The lady that greeted me was nice but her English was basic... not being critical, just sharing the experience. She sent over another nice lady who was able to take my order. The situation was I was asking for something vegan and there was possibly too much banter beyond the norm. Anyway, I ordered the garlic pepper dish with tofu.   So good! Spivey with a lingering tongue burn that I like. I got 5 of 10 which is perfectly spiced. The tofu had a sauteed in oil texture that I love. The pepper and onions all on a bed of lettuce.  So fresh and delicious!   I will definitely come back and for you late night diners, they are open until 4am.  Support you local small businesses.",

I ordered a basil beef fried rice and a hoi jor. The hoi jor reminds me of eggs rolls but with fried wonton skin and crab meat instead. It also came with plum sauce instead of the sweet and sour or the fish sauce. I liked it. The basil fried rice I got was a level 5 spicy but I think a 6 or 7 would be perfect for me. It's pretty spicy if you're not used to eating spicy food.",

It came in a very strange sort of serving tray, split into fours and accompanied by a salad, white rice, and a veggie egg roll.  I had no place to pour my curry on the rice, so the serving style is definitely catered for Americans, which is fine.  I have to say though that the egg roll was my favorite part.  Not because it was particularly well done, but because they use honey in their sweet and sour sauce.  Yummy!  The curry, however, was a bit of a let down.  I ordered beef.  The beef was the typical strips, not particularly outstanding, but not tough and overcooked either.  The curry tasted like they add a lot of milk based cream.  I couldn't really taste any coconut.  It had the consistency of Alfredo sauce, which makes me believe cream was used (authentic Bangkok style Thai curry is soupy).  There's nothing really wrong with that; coconut milk is expensive.  But I want my curry to taste like Thai coconut curry, not weird Alfredo sauce.  The zucchini that they used gave it a nice touch, along with the traditional green and red bell peppers.  Overall though, the curry was a little too sweet and generic tasting, and very heavy.  I ordered a 7/10 heat, and it tasted more like a 2/10.  Yes, the heat levels are Americanized too.    Very nice service, and very nice atmosphere (minus the strip club parking).  The food, however, isn't worth traveling to for me.  It's definitely Americanized, and while not offensive in any way, just not very exciting.",

Today was the final straw for me. I waited more than 20 minutes for my food after ordering. They were not busy, but three other groups arrived after me, finished their lunches, paid and left while I was just starting to eat. I asked someone other than my server for a to-go box and extra rice. He did not bring the rice, so I asked again when he came back. My server heard me this time, as she was approaching with my check. I reviewed it and gave her my credit card. When I got it back, she had charged my card $1.95 more than the original amount (for the extra rice) without my approval. I will not be returning.",

    "text": "After moving to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, there is one thing I really miss from California and that's the adventure in venturing in finding hole in the wall restaurants. The way good restaurants are located are almost always on a big street name like Spring Mountain, Las Vegas Blvd, Flamingo, etc. I was tipped about this place by my girlfriend so this place was a shock when I heard it was on Industrial just close by the back of Circus Circus.  First thought about this place walking in, this restaurant really did it's research and did everything right. Being a former business owner, I often get frustrated by restaurants doing too much by having a long list of food choices and horrible unnecessary decor. The space is no bigger than your living room with 3 booths, 2 two-tops, and counter seating (which currently has no chairs on it). Fits no more than 16 people seated but the decor is both modern, simplistic, and well themed.  The menu, my oh my. Finally a restaurant that got it right!! Just a few choices of about 5 different variation for each type of food such as the noodles, curries, hot pots, and such.  And finally the taste. It's been so hard to find good pad thai for a reason. Often noodles are over cooked, there are too little or too much sauce to flavor the noodle, and most restaurants don't clean and prep the bean sprouts. Thai Street Cafe had prepared the best pad thai I've had since moving out here and I even bought a pad see-ew to-go for my girlfriend just cause I was that impressed.   Great job to the owner and you'll be seeing my face often!",

There's some people watching to be had as well since a \"Showgirl Supply Store\" is next door. A tall, blonde woman pulled up in a new Aston Martin so I got to drool over car as well as the great food at Thai Street. The woman, not so much. She was beautiful but tattoos too many.

But this place, as far as flavor and spices-were just average...even their Thai iced coffee was very sweet, tasted like heavy chocolate syrup. The best thing they had was their pork jerky! Perfectly seasoned and tender! Their house made sauce went perfect with the flavors. Most Thai places only have beef jerky. So when your restaurant has pork jerky that's also a huge plus!  Also they did not have an option for Laos Style Papaya Salad! Most Thai places do not....BUT if your Thai restaurant does have it or can make it that's a HUGE plus-extra star;-)",

I ordered extra sticky rice because I didn't know beforehand). I did wish it had more veggies (so order extra if you like to veg out too). The pad Thai was also tasty. The crying tiger wrap was disappointing.",

The food was cold and soggy from the containers they were in from the water from the steam. Didn't even offer a refund just apologized. They already got their tip because it was put on the cc when the order was placed. We were practically asleep already when it got there and all the delivery guy said was sorry. I don't see how it took him and hour to get here from when we were told the food was out because the hotel is only right down the street (8mins & 2.6 miles). We ordered the food around 11pm and wished we never did. We were even able to cancel the order.  The delivery fee is also $5 not $3.",

No complains there.   Lost a star with the Pad Thai. Might be the worst I've ever had. I've never had pad Thai this dry before, I thought maybe if I stirred it up some of the sauce from the bottom would rehydrate the dry noodles but nope. It was also cold. The noodles were so dry they were stuck together like a block. Since I work in an office I don't have eating utensils and they only provided me with a flimsy spork that doesn't work with this dry, clumpy mess. Wouldn't be so bad if I had soy sauce to pour in it but they didn't give me any in my bag. (My bad for not asking when I ordered though) also no lime or lemon on the side to drizzle over.   Very disappointed with that dish but am hopeful the next time i order something different it will be better. Like I said, EVERYTHING else was amazing and I'm not a fan of ragging on places I intend to order from again, but that pad Thai was a huge mess. I definitely plan on getting yellow curry next time :)",

It was nearly impossible to communicate with the man delivering since he spoke little to no english b) Wrong pricing - over the phone they told us it would cost 38 dollars when it only costed 34, so we ended up paying a total of 10 dollars more when counting tax and tip and the delivery person left before we realized the pricing mistake c) They got our orders wrong - we ordered a Vegetarian Pad Thai with spiciness level 10 and a Chicken Pad Thai with spicy level 2, but they switched the heat, leaving us with an unbearable spiciness on the Chicken Pad Thai and a heat-less Veggie Pad Thai  The food itself was decent, but I would like to see better service and responsibility before I bring my business back.",

She was clearly overwhelmed. It took about 20-30 min just to get seated and get our orders in.  Our food came out pretty quickly afterwards. We ordered the hoi jor and thai dumplings as appetizers, which were good but nothing special. The entrees were delicious, though - giving this place 4 stars on food alone. We had the khao soi - which is one of my favorite thai dishes. This came with a big chicken drumstick, laden with flavor from the soup. The panang curry with chicken was excellent as well, and a the spicy catfish was perfectly fried and flaky. So filling and so good.  Towards the end of the dinner, we were in a bit of a rush to meet up with our other friends for EDC. 45 minutes into our meal, we were still waiting for our coffees which they'd forgotten about. We ended up having to take them to go. Overall, great food with some hiccups in service - which may or may not be the norm here. When I'm back in Vegas, I'll definitely give this place another shot.",

The best thing about this place is that you're probably not going to wait very long as opposed to other Thai in the area.  The service, however, is horrible.  The servers definitely need some kind of training.    Example:  At a table of 6, the server brought out two curries--no SPOONS or silverware of any kind.  Seriously 10 minutes later the curries were still there.  Other diners were food-less and the curry lovers were still spoon-less.  One of our six, in desperation, went to the front counter and asked for a spoon.  They gave her ONE spoon!  For good measure, they made sure it was GIANT!  So now you've got two curry lovers, one giant spoon, and six dumbfounded diners.  There were multiple tables in the joint that all seemed to be experiencing some kind of frustration with the service.",

    "text": "First of all, the location is very misleading; it is between various adult superstores and such. The parking lot is quite small, with only a handful of public parking stalls. The rest are for the surrounding stores.  At first glance, the interior looks and feels contemporary and fresh. There are metal and wood finishes that are not too industrial-looking. My visit here was just okay and I will explain. The dining room sits many people, with booths along the walls and tables dispersed around the space. Despite the abundance of seats, there seemed to be just a couple of servers. I arrived for lunch in a party of 10. Understandably, the food was not expected to arrive quickly. We waited, however, almost an hour for the first dish to arrive. And slowly, one by one we all got our dishes.  If not for the slow service, I would have rated this place 5 stars. The food is very delicious. I got the boat noodle soup, which was very flavorful and hearty. I also got the crab fried rice, which tasted just as I expected. My friends ordered thai iced tea and if you are a fan, you will love their portion size!  I don't think I will be dining in here again. They do have delivery service, so if you are on a lunch break, you might want to look into that instead.",

We order medium spicy on pad Thai, spicy basil meat and pad nang curry, and only the spicy basil I would call mild spicy and tasted good. The pad Thai is so sweet, the pan nang curry is so sweet too... We ordered fried tofu but it came with regular tofu. For the appetizer, it was the first on the menu, fried wenton with shrimp and pork inside. Fishy but crisp. The serving size is not big. So I think it's a bit at the higher end on the price.",

    "text": "I know I have been consistently reviewing Asian restaurants and small cafes , but I am sorry, I am on this adventurous whirlwind of work stress and subsequent nightmares; aggressive allergies and having to repeat myself at least three times, to everyone I know. I don't have the time for my \"Paint the city Red\" reviews right now.   I placed an online order from Thai St. Cafe and that part was super convenient and easy. Somehow, I am always annoyed when I know the place is across the street from where I am and I have to wait 60+ minutes for the delivery anyway.   I had the following items:  Egg rolls Dumplings Chicken Chow Mein  Total: $35 with delivery fee of $3 and a $5 tip.  I wrote very specific delivery notes on the order because my office can be a little hard to find and after placing the order, I immediately called the restaurant to reiterate my notes and told them exactly how to get to me. The hostess said she will relay this to the driver. Of course, when he arrived. he was at the other side of our property, about a mile from my office and I had to explain again. This just annoys me a bit. I already repeated it twice... so, really? You need it again? (See my note about repeating myself).  Eggrolls might have as well been frozen. Not the crispy, flaky roll I expect and get from my home girl at China Bobo. These reminded me of what I used to buy at Sam's Club, like 15 years ago. There was nothing memorable about the item.   Dumplings smelled like farmed or defrosted fish before I even opened the container. Eating them, I did not taste the fish, but definitely smelled it. The taste of pork dominated the dumpling with every chew. I eat meat but I do not like tasting the death of the animal in my mouth as I chew its bits. That was a turn off and I did not eat more than two. The texture of the whole dish was very good and well presented. The plum sauce had a very distinct prune flavor and to me it was great, to some it may be too strong.   Chow Mein was tasty and had a good amount of cabbage, carrots and green onion. The chicken pieces were HUGE and that was pretty much the whole dish. Sliced chicken breast (long way) dominated the dish, and it was sauteed and sprinkled with veggies and noodles. I ate most of the noodles and had a container full of leftover chicken. I have it the fridge at work, but I most likely will never eat it again and will leave it there because I feel badly for having to throw it out.   The Chow Mein portion was actually pretty small now that I think about it.  The 4-5 egg rolls were way smaller than usual so you are basically getting about 3 normal sized rolls for about $7 with tax and fees. Not worth it.   I've spent many paychecks in Chinatown and in Summerlin on great Asian food -- this is not fantastic Thai food -- this is very generic Thai and ti servers its purpose..   I understand that their portions and pricing are due to their proximity to the Strip, but again, Chinatown is 10 min away and there are some fantastic joints there. I can see this being a great place for hungry tourists, who do not want to pay the extortion costs of some of the Strip restaurants, but I would most definitely not make the trip from my neighborhood to eat here.   Based on the items I ordered, the food was just meh for my taste buds.",

Meanwhile there were about 3 tables in the restaurant-that was it. Then the table they sat us at was broken and wobbly anyway. Ridiculous. We asked to be moved and they agreed but were clearly annoyed by it. Our food then took FOREVER to come out, even a couple who came in after us got their food before us...????  Then on to the food. I got the Pad-see ew because it looked so awesome in the pictures. It was not as awesome at all in real life. It was okay, but nothing amazing. It could have been a lot better. Noodles were plentiful and chicken was not. They put broccoli stocks in there instead of actual broccoli heads like they said on the menu.  I just really couldn't believe how average our whole experience was.   On top of all of this the location is awful- not easy to get too, and between two strip clubs also...so on that note I won't be back for the lower then average experience instead I will head to other Thai places.",

Wasn't as spicy as I would have liked (I asked for a 7 out of 10 but got maybe a 3 or 4).   I tried my friend's ribs, very good but a bit chewy. Lots of non-Thai food on the menu.  Very clean and fast service however a search of their health scores varies from C to A over time.  The location is near a bunch of strip clubs and stripper outfitters and is definitely in a sketchy part of town behind the strip. It is an oasis if you will...  Very bummed they did not have beer and do not serve alcohol. I will return on my next trip unless the health score drops again.",

Service lacks in attentiveness: it took a bit more than enough time to look at the menu to order and napkins weren't provided. However, if you pay attention and know anything about the food business, they were busy and lacking staff.  The food, itself, is worth it. I didn't think it'd be fulfilling, but it did the trick. We ordered the Boat Noodle Soup, Tom Yum, and Kao Soy (plus a Thai tea, which was almost 2x more than your normal serving, they don't skip out!). All the broths were delicious and full of flavour. Let me tell you about the Kao Soy though. If you're ever conflicted with getting curry, noodles or soup, this is the dish to get:  1) The broth was the best. The minty, basil taste makes this spicy(medium on the heat scale?), yellow curry-based soup refreshing.  2) The eggs noodles were nice and firm, not undercooked or over cooked, wider than pho noodles but thinner than Pad Thai noodles. 3) The toppings were just right: a tender succulent piece of chicken that's been cooked with the broth, shredded crispy fried wonton noodles that add texture to the dish, and other stuff that weren't noticeable important (pickled veggie, cilantro, beansprouts)  Overall, a good place to eat, just be patient and request stuff if they forget",

My favorite dishes are Yen-Ta-Fo noodles (tomato-based broad rice noodle soup with seafood), Tom Kha with chicken, drunken noodle, kao soy (curry egg noodle), green curry with beef, crab fried rice, larb, and basil fried rice. Very economical and generous serving. They have 10 spice levels. Level 7 is spicy and yummy for me. Also, check out their $7.95 lunch specials on weekdays. Their coconut ice cream is quite good (huge serving as well) but a bit heavy.",

Extremely yummy food with a flair on the hit side, so choose lower number unless you like it extra spicy. The calamari had a beautiful presentation. The pork pad Thai was the best I've ever eaten. Lots of meat, bean sprouts, cilantro, and green onions. This is the one place in Vegas I'll continue to crave long after our vacations over. Loved the art and creative restroom door deco.",

We got to the restaurant at 3:15, upon entering we were not greeted, not acknowledged. After 5 minutes we finally got acknowledged and seated. Maybe 15 minutes in to waiting,  the waitress FINALLY came over.  There was 1 waitress, probably 1 person cooking the food in the restaurant,  and 1 really clueless looking waiter. 3:45 rolled around still no drinks,  no water,  nothing.  At 4 o clock,  still no drinks,  no food, so we just left. Honestly the wait for the food would have been no big deal if i could have at least been served a water.

    "text": "A five-star rating from me. The food and drinks are amazing. We ordered one Thai Iced Tea and one Thai Iced Coffee which were very delicious. The appetizers we ordered were Curry Puffs and Thai Beef Jerky. Both were really good and wasn't dry at all which was surprising considering other restaurants are pretty bad with appetizers. The entrees we ordered were Rad-Nah, Thai Spicy Basil Chicken, and Shrimp Tom Yum. It was so delicious and full of flavor. I really recommend coming here if you have a craving for some authentic Thai food. Best in Las Vegas so far. We also got the Thai Iced Tea for free when we checked in on Yelp. Anyways, as I said, a five-star rating for great food, drinks, and service. Oh yeah, the service was fast, kind, and very good. That's all, folks!",

    "text": "WARNING: Sunday ~12:30 p.m. The restaurant was understaffed; there were two waiters and one, maybe two cooks. I say cooks because the people in the kitchen are not chefs. The tom kha was too sour and salty. The deep fried catfish was not crispy. Ample seating room, however the wait for the food to arrive took very long. They also did not give us a menu while some parties that arrived after us were given menus. There were people complaining about the long wait for food to arrive. This girl I saw had to walk around the restaurant to get the sauce tray. We ordered water when we were seated, but the water did not come until I asked for it for the third time and half way through my meal. The soups do not come with rice unless it is their lunch special(excludes weekend). If you are from California, just wait until you go back to California for some better Thai food. Probably the worst Thai restaurant in California is better than this place. One star because I feel bad for the inefficient waiters who haven't been properly trained, and also because I cannot give less stars.   In conclusion, this place should pay its customers to eat here because time is money, and you will be spending a lot of time waiting for your food.  You are welcome. Hope this review saves you time.",

The food was good and very authenticate Thai food.  I do not recommend this restaurant if you are not used to eating traditional Thai flavors.    The delivery person called me when he was 5 mins away.  They cannot deliver the food to your room and will need you to meet them outside by the passenger drop off.  This was my only complaint.  If I realize that I needed to venture out then I might as well pick up something from the hotel lobby instead of ordering.      By chance, my lyft passed the restaurant on the way back to the hotel.  It is located in a very shady strip center filled with adult entertainment stores.  I guess you can't judge a book by its cover.",

I usually go for Original Thai BBQ or Thai Pepper when I need delivery, because Komol doesn't deliver (major bummer), but neither of those places (Komol excluded) tastes super fresh or healthy.  Thai Street Cafe tastes like the food is fresh and somewhat healthy (as much as thai food can be anyway).  I've had: the pad thai (yum!), the Tom Kha (AWESOME), the papaya salad (spicy!) and a few other things.  Everything has been great so far.  Oh, and if you are the kind of person that has any gut issues...this is one of the few Thai places that doesn't make my b/f's tummy rumble afterwards.    One more thing - we had a gluten-free guest in town and they made the pad thai sans gluten for her all special-like.  NICE!",

Do not let surrounding businesses deter you from enjoying this gem.   The atmosphere and environment is very modern, but casual. You're able to order your food online for carryout or dine in to cut down on time. However, we came during lunch and we seated immediately. The service was decent. The waiter took a little while to bring us drinks and take our order, but there were no more hiccups afterwards. They food and drinks came out in a timely manner as well   The food was absolutely delicious. We started with the chicken curry puffs, which were a little dry but had good flavor, and the Thai dumplings, which were amazing! I went with the chicken Pad Thai for lunch with a spice level of 6/10. The food was inviting in every manner. Lots of flavor while leaving heat in the front of your mouth. Left me feeling warm and full.   Again, if your wanting good food for good value, check out Thai St Cafe.",

Basic offerings with basic taste is exactly what we discovered by eating here.  The customer service lacked luster. I was glad to have iced water since I didn't get asked if I wanted a second cup, at least I had the option of drinking melted ice cubes.   The food was okay, nothing to brag about. If you need something quick and easy, this place will suit you. No fireworks, no excitement. Just food to fill your tummy.   The best thing about this spot is the convenience of its location. The strip can get congested, so venture off the typical path and directly behind it...you'll find this place.",

It's in the strip joint part of the city, and they are clearly trying to catch the girls and the patrons as the clubs close for the night. Not a particularly safe area. However, their chosen location did not influence my review. Inside it looks very nice.   So, we both ordered- 2 waters, 2 Thai teas with boba- mine with extra milk, 2 mango with sticky rice, and he ordered a medium spicy soup. Even though the girl was writing down the order, she repeated it back to us wrong, so we corrected her. That should have been a warning sign.   About 10 minutes later, she finally came back out. She had forgotten the waters, and my Thai tea did not have boba or extra milk in it. We asked for our waters, and it took her several more minutes to bring them out.    Perhaps I should mention here- there were 2 other customers sitting at another table who were halfway through their meal and no one else. And there were 3 or 4 employees (we saw a male and female at the cash register and a male in the kitchen, and we were pretty sure we also saw a female in the kitchen).    So they brought out my bf's soup decently quickly, and when they did I reminded them that I had ordered the mango with sticky rice for my meal. The guy nodded his head and left. 15 minutes passed by while I watched my bf eat his meal before they finally brought me mine. When they did, they asked bf if he wanted his too. Thankfully, he said yes because within 2 minutes they had brought it to the table- translation, it was already done. If he had said no, it would have sat there on their counter getting cold and rubbery until they finally brought it out to him.   Not even halfway through our experience, the other 2 customers left. Even though there were no other customers, they only managed to refill our waters once. And each time they brought us anything, we thanked them, but not once did either of them say \"You're welcome.\"   We finished our food. Bf's soup had almost been too spicy for him to handle even though he LOVES spicy food and had asked for medium spicy. We sat there. And sat there. And sat there... until finally we gave up on the idea that our waitress was ever going to come back to bring us our bill. We went up to the cash register where both our waitress and the guy who had brought out the food were standing hanging out laughing- instead of helping their customers, paid the bill, and left.   Even though the service was atrocious, my boyfriend liked the soup. The mango with sticky rice was definitely not the best I've ever had, but it was okay. They gave us tall glasses of the Thai tea- these are the reasons for the 2 stars instead of just a 1 star review.   Not planning to return- other places have better mango with sticky rice, better soup, and far better service",

    "text": "Craving some Thai and was too lazy to drive, so Yelp and Postmates to the rescue. Got an order of tofu pad Thai at a level 2 spice, beef pad see eew and beef noodle soup. Everything came as ordered correctly. The pad Thai was delicious! I'm usually very cautious when ordering things at a certain spice level when I'm not familiar with the establishment and with this dish, I think the level 2 was perfect. The noodles were al dente and tofu was fried perfectly. The pad see eww had a mix of broccoli and Chinese broccoli. I'm a fan of the Chinese broccoli to add for authenticity and slightly bitter flavor. My sis enjoyed the variation of the veg. The dish, overall, was yum! The beef noodle soup was soo rich in flavor that I hate to complain about the portion size and beef. The beef meatballs were typical, but the sliced beef seemed overly dry... as if it were cooking for way too long? Regardless, I'd be back to order more food from here and probably stick to just a meatball beef noodle soup. They also included some dried chili flakes, which was much appreciated since I forgot to ask for some when placing my order.",

Staff did not bother to check up on my party / table until we waived them down.  -gratuity was applied to my bill even though my party was split into two tables.  -Water was not served because we ordered a Thai tea and there weren't enough cups. Staff said something along the lines of, \"I'm afraid of you request for water, you might get a dirty cup.\" -we had to go up to the front counter to pay, as I had also mentioned before, staff did not check up on me and my party.   One positive thing I can say about this joint is the food is great. Get it delivered or take out. Do not dine in. You'll face such a horrible customer service",

    "text": "Well... We came in here one night after ordering on line. We were on our way home from studying and decided a Panang curry, basil fried rice, and a papaya salad sounded like a good idea.  The area is well lit... And located amongst adult stores and down the street from a few strip clubs. The decor is cute... And the restaurant is a decent size. It appeared that there were more people waiting for take out than dining it... But it was also almost 1am so it made sense.   Being a vegan, there were some modifications to our order... Like no egg/butter in the fried rice, no shrimp Flakes in the papaya salad, and No shrimp paste in the curry. We were informed when we arrived that they saw the modifications and they didn't use shrimp paste in the curries... Yes! We sat down and waited... And waited... And waited... We went back up to the counter around 1:30 and asked for an estimate time... We were told \"soon\". Not wanting to piss anyone off and have something happen to our food... We opted to not mention the long wait time and sit back down. 18 min later... We walked back up to the counter... We placed our order online before we even got to the restaurant. From the time of arrival, we were had already been waiting 50 min.  I was basically ready to just ask for our money back and go to vickies diner. 2 min later our food appeared in the window... And she gave my friend a Thai tea for waiting...   We checked the order before leaving and noticed the fried rice had egg...  Not wanting to wait another hour for them to fix it... We left. The food is good. The service is horrible... And the wait time is awful. Would I go back? If I was desperate for Thai food and nothing else was open... Yes. Would I go out of my way to come here? Definitely not.",

She asked for my name and then realized that there was an order sitting in the printer.   I stood there with my worker waiting and we were not even acknowledged. I asked if it was ready and I just got a state.  I asked again if it was ready and she responded by saying, No\".  30 minutes later I'm still waiting and no order.   We inquired how long and the only response I received was \"waiting for pad Thai\".   There was no apology, no acknowledgement of the mistake, nothing offered while we waited, NOT EVEN WATER!  I would suggest you go to a great Thai place like Kung Fu where the service is impeccable and the food is DELICIOUS!  I will not be back to this place unfortunately and will share my unfortunate experience with my colleagues and friends.",

Perfect location. Ambiance was great. Nice decor. Very modern design. I liked it.  Up until we ordered. She didn't ask how spicy we wanted any of the dishes. We ordered Pad See Ew, Panang Curry, Pad Thai, and the chicken wings appetizer. Each dish was very sweet, no spice.   Chicken wings - good sauce, decent serving size Pad Thai - too peanuty Panang curry - didn't even wanna try it, but my family said it was decent. Looked a little watery, not creamy enough Pad see ew - VERY bland  Not only was the food EH, it definitely wasn't worth the price! The customer service was terrible. We didn't get water within the first 10mins. Mind you, they only had one other table to tend to. And this place wasn't closing any time soon.   Decor/ambience - 5/5 Food - 2/5 Customer service - 2/5  I would never return to this place even if I lived in Vegas, sorry not sorry!",

Despite the 70-90 minute delivery time listed, our food came in 15 minutes, even after the restaurant called to confirm our order and said it would be 45 minutes. Can't complain about that! Not the best Thai food I've eaten by far, but the quick and easy convenience of this place was just what we needed.",

(We told them to go ahead and start...once we realized our food wasn't coming any time soon...)  We didn't have the proper number or type of place settings, and it took several tries to get a spoon for the curry.    The food was okay, but I wouldn't be back based on the service.",

Parking was slightly difficult because half the spots were \"Reserved\" for specific people or stores or time slots.   We went into Thai St and first thing noticed was the cleanliness of the space. We were the only people who were there at the time, immediately placed our order, but it took about 20-30 minutes for the food to come out. An excessively long time for the food to come out...   We ordered a pad thai with shrimp: average thai. Good spice, good quantity. We also ordered the red curry -- great quantity and was on par with a decent thai restaurant. Lastly, we ordered a thai beef salad -- a little simple, only the beef and some lettuce leaves (probably wouldn't order this one again).   Only big qualm about this place is the slow pace of the restaurant. Would come back again.",

We ordered chicken satay , tom yum soup, drunken noodles , crab fried rice , red curry and Thai tea for drinks.   First of all let me start with appetizer . Chicken satay was pretty good with peanut sauce on side .   Drunken noodles amazing I loved it . Crab fried rice had lot of meat in it and had a aroma which was so good. Over all we enjoyed the food and the service was the reason I gave four stars . There were only two people working and they will need to take care of billing , ordering and serving food. On Saturday evening it's little difficult for two persons to manage that big place . Other than that everything was great",

First the waitress didn't bring us water or drinks or plates. The food comes out and we ask another waiter for drinks and everything. He comes and beings it over. Food comes out fast and good.   Our waitress didn't come to us at all until the bill comes. She brings me the bill with gratuity already added when there are only four of us. I told her and she said oh that was her mistake and that she'll adjust it. I could tell she tried to sneak it on there so when I left cash I intentionally left the tip off. I don't give money to scammers.   As we pack up and leaving she comes over to me and tells me that I didn't leave her a tip and \"why- was the service bad?\" I said honestly - yes and told her why. She didn't check on us once, didn't bring us our meals. Etc\" she snaps and says \" oh ok you should take your penny change- you keep it\" at that point- I was pissed and told her to keep it. As I'm walking out she says \" keep it. You can save it for your baby.\"    I have a seven month old son. If anyone reading this has kids- you could understand how insulting that is. People like that don't have any decency or respect even for themselves- that's why she's at where she's at in her career.   I told her she can keep the tip and left. I didn't want to turn the place into the last 48.   As we were packing the car- her friend/coworker comes out and says something to us. I confront her and she said she didn't say anything - wanting to be slick and avoid any trouble.   We left. I recommend any place but this one. It's the tallest manly looking waitress there. You'll know who she is when you see her.   Also triple check your bill.",

I woke up starving and did not want to leave the comforts of the Encore. I was browsing yelp and really wanted some soup and some greasy food to satisfy my hunger. This place wasn't far at all and they also delivered. I gave it a shot and ordered everything through yelp. It was the quickest and most painless way to order. I had never had such an easy experience ordering.  The review gets better! I was expecting the food to be ready in about an hour or more, but within 40 minutes I got a call saying they were ready with the food by the elevator. I totally didn't expect it to be done that quick, let alone waiting for me downstairs. The food filled a void that made my inner child jump for joy and smile from ear to ear with glee. The soup was hot and delicious, the appetizers were crispy and tasty, the main course was perfectly cooked and seasoned. There were no complaints even if I had a bad day and a hidden agenda from here. Honestly, how could you? The food was amazing and the service is second to none.   I ordered pretty basic items, but that's all I needed. The whole time while receiving the delivery and eating it, I was in awe of how easy it all was. The ordering was simple and quick. The delivery was fast and courteous. The food was good for a hungry, half hungover, lazy sob. The next time I'm in this situation, I would gladly rinse and repeat everything I done this day. I would give more stars if I could, but only 5 available, but they deserve each and every one of them. I told this story a few times, and I hope more hear about it and follow.",

I had Thai St Cafe delivered to my hotel after a super long day of walking. My boyfriend and I decided on thai food over sushi and we didn't think we would regret our decision so much.   Food: Pad See Ew: I ordered a 2 on the spiciness for the pad see ew after reading that the spicy ranges from 1-10. I expected the spiciness to be slightly more spicy than mild but it was SO spicy that I threw it out after eating a few bites. My stomach was unsettled for the rest of the night. It was completely flavorless aside from the extreme heat. Usually pad see ew is rather sweet and savory but this one was dry, bland, and just way too spicy for what I ordered.  Pad Thai: My boyfriend had this one and he finished most of his. He ordered 8 on spiciness and he thought it was really spicy. But that was what he wanted so it was fine. It wasn't that flavorful aside from the spiciness either though.  Chicken wings: I thought maybe at least chicken wings wouldn't disappoint me but I was wrong. The wings were pretty dry and spicy even though the sauce was advertised as sweet chili. What happened to the sweetness?   I was so disappointed that I wasted a meal in Vegas on this.",

Also got a free thai tea b/c I ordered $25+.  The eggplant is really tasty & has a great sauce. You can order what protein you'd like it to come with, I chose the tofu which was fried tofu but very good!  The pad thai is good & sweet. Nothing extraordinary about it though.  Yellow curry was great as well, I got chicken & it came with bits of potato & carrots. The rice that came with the yellow curry seemed like sticky rice, which was bomb.  Thai tea is on point! Make sure to check the coupon section if u order on yelp eat24 to get a free thai tea.   The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because  1.) the location is helluh sketchy!! It's on industrial which is where a lot of entertainer building are at. I pasted the place at first & when I got to the building it was very close to an entertainer club. Lots of sketchy people around there.  2.) the portions from take out seemed kind of small. Other thai or asian places I order from use the same containers but pack it to the brim. They didn't pack the food to the top :( but nonetheless I still got into a food coma from the tasty food :)   overall, would recommend 8/10. but maybe go during the day? :-)",

There were two servers in the restaurant - one a skinny lady who was really sweet & the other a bitchy piece of work (whom I'll be referring to PoW henceforth).  So PoW took us 10 minutes to get water. Took our order. We got a red curry because its easy & quick and we were ready to go on with our day. Fast forward 30minutes, we are still waiting for our order. Meanwhile 3 other customers come in after us and get their orders. We ask how much time its going to be and PoW snaps \"we can't tell you how much\". eh, what?  We wait 15 more minutes (We are in the restaurant for an hour at this point). People who came after us have ate and left. We ask PoW again and get the same answer. We want to cancel the order. Sweet server walks in, apologizes and offers a free papaya salad while the order is cooking.  PoW goes behind her back to make papaya salad EXTREMELY spicy (I am Indian, I can take spice) & cancels our red curry order.  What the actual fuck? We leave after an hour, hangry and confused. Skip this place. There are better places to go to on and around the strip.",

I even ordered once at 30 min. to closing and they delivered with exceptional service, came right up to door with a smile and my two dishes, an appetizer and complimentary Thai Tea! Sorry about the late order....but I was starving. Anyway, my recommendation is the drunken noodles and the TomYum, but I may be biased because I love TomYum and will order it at every Thai place to see the variations. The Tom Yum here was good, although, I wished the flavor was more robust (?) Perhaps I just love strong lemongrass, galangal root and a tinge more spices flavor.  I also ordered their glass noodle salad and the pad woon sen, - both of which I loved.  I've never dined in, but the ambience is relaxing and looks like a good place to bring a few friends for lunch or dinner.",

At first I had doubts Becuase the health dept. grade was a \"C\". Well that didn't stop me from trying this place out since they close very late.   We ordered: 1. Tom yum soup- 8/10- little bit spicy for a level one. It was very delicious. 2. Papaya salad- 8/10- good portion. Has a strong taste of the sauce and refreshing. 3. Pad See-ew?-7/10- very good and juicy. 4. Mango sticky rice-10/10- super amazing and so much to share around.  All I can say is customer service is A+ they are very nice and appreciative.",

So went to look for this restaurant. Ummmm..wth. are we lost? There were advertisements of girls girls girls and store for strippers and we were thinking where is this place?   This restaurant is located in that plaza where all the girls girls girls stuff are..YIKES. So ODD. The lot was empty pretty much, we walked in and the restaurant was nice. The layout is really roomy. Wood floor and wood walls with sleek looking black furniture including the booths. Nicely decorated which makes the place looks big and clean as well.   We sat in one of the booths with 5 people instead of sitting at their super duper large tables. We ordered a few items such as their curry, noodles, fried rice, and pork dish. The curry was everyone's favorite there was so much flavor in their curry. I really liked their pork dish as well. The service was normal, they weren't busy at all but they were busy preparing to go orders here and there. We had to flag them each time we needed water refills. It was a bit spicy for me but luckily for me I ordered their Thai tea and that helped tamed the hit in my mouth..Hot Hot Hot.  Overall I was simply surprised by this place. There were so many mixed reviews that I just thought at least we get to eat. But it wasn't that way at all, we were all satisfied and liked the food very much.   YUMMY!",

We came back the next day and ordered the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. The Pad Thai was a little bit too oily and needed a lime to give it some kick. The Yellow Curry was ok, but flavor wise was nothing special. 3/5 for the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry.",

All of the meats were under seasoned and the entrees were fairly bland. Their attempt to make the dishes spicy was to dump a tablespoon of red pepper flakes on the top of the curry. They didn't even bother to stir it in. And it wasn't the good Thai chili pepper seasoning, just red pepper flakes.   Out of 5 stars   Basil fried rice - 2 Pad pak - 1  (the beef was bland and chewy) Yellow curry - 1 (portion was tiny) Garlic pepper chicken - 1 (yuck)",

It's good to have the 1-through-10 option of increasing the heat of the food, though I'm not clear on whether that reflects the spiciness before or after I dumped the little plastic container of chili sauce into my rice. I'd asked for a 6 and found that extra heat was needed.  This is a very good meal option relatively close to the Strip. I walked over from the Palazzo and, while it's not very pleasant, it didn't seem unsafe - there are sidewalks and signalized crosswalks along Sammy Davis.",

I ordered pud see yew, pad thai, thai tea and sticky rice with mango. Everything was excellent: Quality, temperature, packaging, flavor, delivery service and pricing. With the entrees, you can select how spicy you want your food. I went with \"4\" and that was plenty spicy (and I like spicy food). I'll probably go with 2 or 3 next time as Thai spice is no joke.

However they most certainly didn't meet my expectations.  The service was very basic. No one was unfriendly or rude, but they barely came to the table and rarely checking in on us.  As for the food, although their flavors are extremely noticeable in their food, and it tasted great... their spice range is way off!! Per usual, they always ask what spice level do you want, on a scale from 1-10. I ordered a 4, even though I LOVE spicy food. But oh my goodness, that was the SPICIEST \"4\" I've ever seen.  So since the food actually tastes good, I recommend you order like 5 levels lower on spice that you would normally order.  So, I'm not convinced this is the \"best\" place in town for Thai, but it was pretty \"okay.\"",

So when my family and I went back to our resort hotel we were not feelin room service so I was the only one wanting Thai so I took the trip to go to Thai St Cafe since they had good reviews on yelp.  They had Thai Chicken Basil grounded and I was so happy. This place is so pretty on the inside, however the outside and the area appears to be shady. A few establishments down is a gentleman's club so there was A LOT of men roaming around up to no good. I was hesitant of getting out of the car due to that fact but I was like what could possibly happen from my car to the restaurant in 5 feet.  So I ordered my meal and waited a good 10 minutes. I got into my car and left. My sister was with me and was happy we were leaving the area, maybe day time is better...who knows.  So when I got back to our stay, I opened up my meal it was not what I ordered and they gave me the wrong meal -_- it was some type of noodles that was good but was not my Thai Ground Chicken Basil. I was disappointed due to that but the noodles and chicken were good.  Make sure to check your order before you leave!!",

Our food came out within a very reasonable amount of time if not fast. The portions are pretty average compared to Thai places. So overall, I think four stars is appropriate.   Personally recommend the Basil Fried Rice over all the other fried rice options!!  Located in a very random area so keep your eyes open when looking!",

I couldn't finish the soup but the flavors were good and took the rest back to the hotel. They also let you pick your spice level which was nice.

I asked for no raisins and it came with raisins so the waitress quickly took it away but they did not recook my order, they just took out the raisins.

One of the best I've had.  Pork spare ribs: 3/5 it's not what the picture looks like. I thought it was going to be whole ribs but it's ribs cut into bite sized. It was a bit salty. Not what I expected but flavor is good, just salty and a bit over powering   Beef egg plant: it was good. I'd give it a 4/5.   Pad see ew: good too, 3.5/5   Thai teas are huge so I'd recommend splitting it lol. And this was really good too, doesn't taste watered down or overly sweet. Perfect.    Note: they had us move to another table after we ordered Bc they got a call in for a bigger party and we (party of 6) were sitting at the table for 10+ so they had us move to another table. As an apology they gave us a young coconut drink which was nice. I don't care too much for the freebie but I really appreciate these types of gesture.",

Crab fried rice - if you love crab they put big pieces of crab in it and there was a lot of pieces. No being stingy with them!  Panang curry - just as it should! It was good! Now try it!  Thai tea - who doesn't love it? It was good as always.  If you are in the hood, give them a try. They are a must try if you love Thai. OH and there do not use MSG! YAY",

I doubt I'll be coming back again... the other 3x I told them they made a mistake and they not once offered to correct it complimentary...

I called in my order at 8:52pm last night, I tried to order one of my favorite dish which was listed on their menu which is \"Crying Tiger\" sliced beef with a sauce, the guy said they no longer have that... disappointing...anyways I placed my order and it took almost 3-4minutes for him to finally understand what I wanted.  We were driving on the strip and was stuck in mad traffic.  The guy said 15 mins.. well we didn't get there until about 9:34pm and guess what?! The order still wasn't done!!!  We didn't get our food until about 9:40pm.. my fiance was waiting and thought maybe they will offer him something to drink for the inconvenience but heck no they didn't.. he asked for a soda and course they charged him $2 which isn't a big deal but considering that they said 15 mins from when we hung up which was about 8:55pm, I was very irritated.. to make matters worst when we got back to our hotel, their sticky rice was hard and non chewable!!  None of their dish impressed me.. I will never ever order or even consider this place again.  Thanks for making our experience a horrible one!!",

I always order their thai style chicken wings which are really spicy but I like it. There used to be 7 fairly sized wings, but lately there are only six and the size has gotten a bit smaller..   Most of this update is for the service though. Servers are really nice and friendly but has become super slow. It wasn't like this before. I guess because they're getting busier and busier lately. I come here on my lunch time at work I'd say about 3-4 times a week. Lately, they take about 20-25 minutes to serve my food. They don't offer refills unless I wave one of them down. One time I had to go up to the cashier to ask for extra napkins.   I will still come here as I really like the food. but not on my lunch breaks anymore.",

The red curry (Med spicy) had very deep flavor a locked in the coconut base and although it was rich it still had a delicate body. Finally for dessert we had their mango sticky rice which was great. A large helping of sticky rice with coconut milk and ripe mangoes always goes great together! I will definitely be back.",

It's easy to find, because it's located in a strip mall near a bankruptcy lawyer and several strip clubs and an adult toy store:) We were not expecting such a beautiful place considering it's tucked away in this area. Beautiful and clean, with their daily specials hand-written in Thai on a chalkboard - very charming. The food is outstanding and the server was friendly. Bonus points because she realized my friend is vegetarian and offered to have our meals made without fish sauce, without us asking first. I highly recommend this place.

Just had pad thai and fried rice both with chicken and a thai iced tea all were phenomenal. Last night the food was 2nd to none and leftovers this morning were just as good. Open till 4am and near 1Oak is a pairing made in heaven.",

The rice was very fresh and not greasy. It had whole vegetables and the chicken was moist. It had a nice hint of sweetness to it. The curry puffs and sauce were amazing. They are hand made and were cooked to perfection. All of the taste blended together nicely with just the right amount of heat. The jerky was good. It wasn't the staple I thought but it was good and I can see how one would come to crave it. All in all I enjoyed the take out. My husband was impressed with the cleanliness and his service. We will be regulars.",

The khao soy had too much turmeric that it was overpowering but overall the flavor was still good. I wish we were able to try more foods but we weren't that hungry. I'd definitely come back here again.",

We came with a party of 8 and got a table pretty quickly, but it took 10 mins to get menus. It took another 20 mins to get water to the table. The food got mixed reviews. The red curry and pad see ew was good, but the pad thai was bitter and the orange chicken tasted like straight lemon. Our server did not keep up with our drinks and was difficult to track down. When asked to switch a pad Thai for yellow curry they were quick to oblige, but brought red curry instead. It was good, but not what was ordered. The overall experience took an extremely long time for subpar food. Since 18% gratuity was already included because of our party size, we were put as their last priority. This is frustrating because the server did not earn his tip. We won't be coming back.",

I have no idea what their restaurant looks like because we ordered delivery via yelp's Eat24 service. Only $3 for delivery! And who wants to walk outside during 107 degree weather? Not me!  Their pad see ew noodles were excellent. Papaya salad could've been crispier/cooler but it could've warmed up from the sweltering heat. Who can blame that poor little papaya salad then? Not me. I wilted from just sticking my head out of the hotel doors.   Pad Thai a little too sweet for me, but still good.   And did I say this place was affordable? Fed 4 adults and 2 kids for $58 after tax, tip, and delivery. And we had leftovers. Unheard of in these parts. Thanks cafe Thai for keeping it sane here in Vegas.",

Although Yelp states they don't deliver to our area (Desert Springs Hospital) I called anyways and they were willing to deliver.    The food we've tried has all been consistently good and tasty.    Pad see ewe w/ Chicken.  Flat noodles with meat and broccoli.  Delicious.  Drunken Noodles w/ combination meat ($3 more) -  Nice sized shrimp, beef, and chicken.  Thick flat noodles with tomatoes, mushrooms, onions.  Very Good.  Red curry (first time with chicken, second time with shrimp -$2 more)  Shrimp is large.  The curry is very, very good and comes with a side of rice.  Spiciness level can be customized from 1-10.   Not much a difference from a 2 to 4 in my opinion.   4 could be considered hot to people who dislike spicy foods.  Chow mein w/ Beef-  Seemed to be a favorite from my co-workers.    Thai Iced Tea-  WORTH $3.95.   So large.  So refreshing.  So tasty.    Also, ask for a free small thai iced tea with Yelp check in.  Papaya Salad-  Good portions, does not come with any meat.  Had it spicy level 6 and had a very nice kick to it.     Chicken Satay- 4 sticks and comes with peanut sauce.  Pretty good.  Delivery service was fast.  Ordering might be the hardest part.  The first night an older Asian man answered the phone and his accent was very hard to understand when ordering by phone.  The lady that answered the next day for more delivery spoke much better English.  The entrees all are around $8.95 for a decent portion and they are open til 4 A.M.!   Perfect for us night shift people who get super hungry in the middle of the night.  Will be ordering from them again, I'm sure of it.",

While the staff was friendly, they could not keep up with the number of customers. We waited quite a while to place an order. Our water glasses were also often empty, and I saw food sit in the window for some time. I felt for the staff because they rarely even had time to answer the constantly ringing phone.   With this many customers and this much waiting, you would think the food would be amazing. The fried rice dishes and the soups were presented beautifully. Unfortunately, I ordered a noodle dish, and it was just okay. I ordered a 10, and it was not spicy at all, which is always a huge disappointment for me. There were also a large number of onions, and some of the pieces of chicken were just fat.  Overall, I won't be back, since Thai that isn't spicy, just isn't for me. The restaurant is beautiful, though, and I wish them the best.",

    "text": "I absolutely love my Thai food so I'm always hunting for a good place, at first I came here as I worked close by and they are open late the food at the time was  good -satisfactory. If you ever get food delivered I HIGHLY suggest calling them as soon as you place the order and reminding them That you have placed a order, otherwise you will be waiting an extremely long time. This happened 3 times to me, I put up with it as at the time I didn't have another Thai restaurant close enough to deliver. The breaking point was my last visit with the food quality once again lowered and became very average. The server even charged me extra for beef pad see ew noodle, come on its always beef !  Also when you check in you get a free Thai iced tea, two times they denied me saying I had to dine in when I was picking up food and when I finally was dining in the last time they said oh no it's for the small Thai tea and charged me for the drink I ordered anyway. Don't bother having a check in gift if you are not willing to give it to your customers and don't add a heap of extra charges it just makes the customer feel ripped off. I also had a soup on my last visit they light  it on fire under neath which had a cool effect however the chief must of put far to much fuel and the fire kept going over the bowl and burning me, all my arm hairs were burnt off. In the end I just moved it to the side of the table and waited till it stopped which took a very long time and made the effects really more of a bother. I mentioned this to the server but they didn't do anything. I can honestly say I have eaten here a min of 10 times previously and I will no longer eat here any more, a combination of feeling ripped off, bad customer service and the tipping point of the food getting worse was the cause. I should of looked else where the moment I went into the store and saw its between a \"late night massage\" shop and almost next door to a strip club.",

They use real crab meat and I thought it complemented the noodle dish perfectly.  The reason why I gave this restaurant a 4-star rating is because the service was very slow.  They only employed one person for the entire restaurant during lunch and while he was nice, he was stretched too thinly and I felt sorry for him.    I'd also recommend not coming here with kids as it's located in a plaza with a lot of adult-themed stores.  The location is very bizarre, indeed, but definitely a hidden gem just off the strip.",

    "text": "You travel through the back area near the Vegas strip to find a lot of adult shops, some rundown buildings and...a modern Thai restaurant?  That's exactly where Thai St. Cafe is and although the location is weird, everything else is pretty darn solid.    The menu is pretty commonplace as most other Thai restaurants with your noodle/soup/entree dishes (along with some really nicely priced lunch items that go for about $7-9).  The most interesting item for me here was the rarer Kao Soy soup noodle dish.  With a very heavy, almost curry-like broth and a beautiful presentation (and for about only $11-12), it's a highly recommended item for anyone looking for something more adventurous and doesn't break the bank.  I also had the thai milk tea which tasted pretty good - loved that it came in a mason jar.  No alcohol that I saw to my knowledge though.      The decor of the cafe was very modern and super clean.  At lunch time on a Friday, it wasn't crowded (although I do hear it gets busier as the night comes along).  Kudos to Honey for the terrific service/advice as well - really friendly and made me feel very welcome.  Parking wasn't too bad - just make sure to watch out for incoming traffic depending on how you're coming in.    Affordable, solid food, great service. Thai St. Cafe is a great find for someone looking for Thai that isn't too far from the main strip.",

Highly recommended for a quick affordable, tasty meal.",

Terrible customer service too the guy lied and said he just left the restaurant.. even though when I called an hour ago they said the delivery guy was out with it.

First off decor is quaint and comfortable with the dark wood textures with hints of of the kind of bangkok feel. The food itself (I got Pad See Ew, Spicy Chicken Wings, and Thai Milk Tea). The wings are spicy but addictive and you just want to keep eating it. The thai milk tea is what you expect, good. The pad see ew was similar in expectation and met it with its savory rice noodles. I did wait a bit for my food (roughly 45 min from my order went in, as it seems they have a lot of people ordering delivery), but they compensated with complimentary thai tea (I was half way through the one i ordered) for me not complaining and being patient. Overall good experience for getting food at 1 AM.",
