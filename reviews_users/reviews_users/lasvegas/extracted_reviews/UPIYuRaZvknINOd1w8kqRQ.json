The drink: they don't really have a variety of drink on their menu but no worry, kungfu tea is right next door. The price: very reasonably low The onyl thing negative about this place is you always have to wait in a long line but it also not a huge deal when it is this good.",

    "text": "I must say, out of all the ramen places I've tried, Monta definitely sticks out. I've had ramen from NorCal, SoCal, and New York. I don't call myself very knowledgeable but I sure as hell know what I like to eat. The best ramen place that I've tried is Ippudo, which is located in Manhattan NY. However, Monta does come close.  Monta is quite a small restaurant and it has one of those homely feels to it. One thing I didn't quite like was how stuffy it was. I went during one of the warm days, it wasn't even hot, but all they had was fans and I couldn't even feel them. So the place had pretty poor circulation and stuffy. I'd hate to see what it's like during an actual summer temperature where it hits over 100 degrees.   I had their tonkotsu ramen with corn -- definitely recommended. Their broth is rich and full of flavor. It is yummy. However, because of how rich and yummy the broth is, I don't suggest adding an egg to it. Because once you do, the egg loses its flavor and the broth overpowers it. So no point.   I would've given this place five full stars if it were not for the waitress that helped us. Oh the service was fine throughout our meal. When we first took our orders down, she offered us, \"Would you like everything on one check or split checks?\" We were a party of 8. Obviously, some had cash and some didn't so we would prefer the latter. So we answered with, \"Split checks would be nice :)\" But then she responds with, \"I could do that but could you please not do 8 separate checks? It's a little bit too much.\"  I'M SORRY? Really, why did you even bother to offer?   I didn't feel like arguing or bothering so we just went with one check. You don't offer something then take back your offer. Or at least lay your own terms down before you finish offering. Thank you.   But hey. Food's good. :) Just that tiny bit irked me.",

Once I walk in to restaurant, smell stronger when walk closer, it is open kitchen, so that you can see how they make and prepare the food, it can make people feel safe to eat and I saw almost everyone order the ramen, so that may the one reason why all flavor comes out so quickly. Once I get menu, not much food option in the menu, several ramen and fried rice to choose, I heard their ramen is good, so I order the miso ramen with thin noodles, add corn and egg on top. About 15 minutes, the server give me my ramen, this ramen looks so bright and opaque, because it have green onion and a little bit seaweed with the corn and egg on top, those makes this dish so colorful, once I smell the dish, it is fragrant and looks like very tasty. The noodles very soft and moist, when I eat that my mouthfeel is smooth and stringy, the soup is very salty for me, and the egg is cold and smooth too, when I ate a lot of soup I feel oily.

    "text": "As comfort food goes, Ramen can be such a go-to meal when it's cold outside (We both sweat WAY TOO MUCH to be slurping noodles in mega hot molten lava broth in the summer)! So during the colder months, we make our way as much as possible to Monta for Ramen  It's tiny noodle shop, the counter seats ten and five table tops that seats twelve total.  It's open until late at night and it cranks out people like no one's business-prety much there's always a waiting list to get into this place!  And it is well worth it,  the Ramen is some of the best that we have had, (and that includes Japan!  Gasp! Horror! Blasphemy!) but it's True-we went to Hide Chan Ramen in Fukuoka and the broth wasn't as good as Monta's!  As we always do, there's a couple of things that we order and not much else, (it's hard to venture out when you know a dish is that good).  We start the Japanese journey with an order of the Gyoza; these pork dumplings are perfectly cooked, a crunchy charred exterior that holds in the moist juices of the pork.  Add Sujoyu, (a mixture of Vinegar and Soy Sauce) Rayu (Chili Oil) and some raw garlic, dip these little moon shaped suckers in it and pop' em in your pie hole!   After you've wet your appetite, it's time move onto the Main Event; the Ramen.  As is, we're partial to the Tonkotsu (Pork Bone) Ramen- the broth is made from simmered Pork Bone, Fat and Collagen which gives it its super rich, almost creamy soup that can easily fill you up and warm your body.  It's most definitely the most satisfying noodle soup on this planet.  And especially since this is a Kyushu dish, (Fukuoka is on the  island of Kyushu) I'm particular to the flavor.  (Japan based on its regions have different tastes and styles to the same dish).    Monta's Tonkotsu Ramen recipe is from Kurume, (not far from Fukuoka) so it's really close to my heart.  Which is why you won't see me ordering the other Ramen, (there's Shoyu, Miso and Tonkotsu-Shoyu).  One of these days, We'll get to them......  There's a couple of add ons and I would definitely go and order an extra Chashu, (Roasted Pork) these tender slices of heaven are as much as a main character as the Noodles and Broth.  Getting to the Noodles, have you ever had anything better than Ramen Noodles? They're just so unique; chewy and Monta really cooks them right.  We also get the Nitamago, (cooked egg) Takana, (Mustard Leaf) and sometimes Nori, (Seaweed) -the egg for extra protein, the Takana for the vegetable and crunch and Nori for the contrast in texture.  You can also order an extra helping of Ramen Noodles (Kaedama) if you have extra broth, but there's no way I have ever had enough room for that!!!  In the Summertime, they serve Hiyashi-Chuka (Cold Chinese Noodles). It's refreshing and cold perfect for the summer with bits of Ham, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts, Takana, Nori and Sesame Seeds over Ramen noodles in a light Soy; it's the best on a hot day!!!  I forgot to mention the Rice bowls that they serve as well; I'm not the biggest fan of these bowls but that just me- a lot of people rave about them!  I know what I like and I'm happy staying on my side of the menu if you know what I mean...The service here is excellent, the waitresses are terribly polite and the the food comes outs really fast! (They need too, cuz they have to get people in and out of there)!  Ratings (Out of Five Stars)  Food          4.75 Ambience  4 Service      4.5",

    "text": "Monta is the best ramen in Vegas!!!!   This restaurant is located in a small plaza and it's also a small location that can sit only about 20-25 ppl.   There is usually at least an hour wait during dinner and lunch time.   They don't take reservations and won't sit you unless all parties are present.  I highly recommend coming during a weekday or early before rush hour.   But even if you had to wait, it's still worth trying for the 1st time.  The food comes out really fast and the servers are not a few feet away.   Monta is very efficient in getting you in and out.  The menu overall is very affordable and what's even better is that the ramen is delicious!     The 2 dishes you have to try are Kuro Ramen Black Garlic oil $7.95 and Takana Fried Rice $6.95.  The ramen broth is very rich from a long period of simmering and the noodles comes out chewy just like the way i like it.  If you like roasted garlic, you have to try it.  I found the flavor was even better when you add chili oil.  Eat this ramen fast because the soup gets richer and saltier the longer the soup sits.   It was a bit too salty and thicker for my liking.  But it's still a good ramen that you can't get anywhere else in this world!!!!!  You can also add additional toppings for additional fee if you are feeling adventurous.   The Takana Fried rice is the best rice i have ever had and i want to note that i'm not much of a ricer eater.  But the way they made the fried rice is out of this world.  Its served with chasu pork, mustard vegetables, green onions, eggs and white onions.  I loved the texture with the white and green onions mixed together.  They also give you a side of radish ginger for more enhanced flavoring.   Note:  1.  They do accept credit card if the bill is over $10. 2.  They don't allow you to bring drinks from another restaurant.",

Their broth tastes like a slice of heaven, there are no words to describe this concoction they put together, but trust me, you have to try it! Pork belly appetizer is really good as well",

We waited 45 minutes to be seated because the place itself is tiny. There's space for maybe 35 people maximum. There's space for about 3 people to wait inside and the rest have to wait outside. Today was hot and the sun was shining right on us so we tried to squeeze inside which didn't make the servers very happy.   Food was 5/5. The ramen was hands down the best ramen I have ever had. I had the spicy ramen. Everything about it was perfect.   However, the server asked us to leave when we were done eating so they could make room for others because \"they're waiting.\" We weren't even sitting for five minutes before he asked us to. I paid for their food and tipped them for their service. If I wanted take out I would have took the food to go. The reason we go out to eat is so be able to socialize and talk.  That was extremely rude and I don't think should ever happen again. If this is their normal attitude toward customers then I'm disappointed in their staff and something should be changed.",

This ramen is what I compare all other ramen to. Don't think the noodles are hand made, don't care. Hot tea served in a soda can, don't care. Eggs probably don't come from cage free, free range chickens, don't care.  Sometimes when I'm eating soup somewhere else I get sad because I could be eating soup here.

When my friends and I got here the line was out the door. 6 groups of 4 ahead of us and a full house cramped with people. The only reason we stayed and waited was because my friends were really craving ramen. If you really want Monta Ramen, try the location on Eastern and Serene (Next to EOS). That place isn't as busy as this one!  The ramen was good, portion was generous which is why I'm even giving this place 2 stars. I also ordered gyoza and it tasted like it was the frozen kind you buy from the store. I suspected that because it was still cold in the middle and because they were all stuck together. Im guessing they half assed cooking it because it was busy.   Their condiments on their table (soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, gyoza sauce) weren't labeled and when my friend picked up the vinegar, the lid opened and spilled it all over the table. It seemed full so I'm guessing whoever refilled it didn't close the lid properly.   Lastly, I felt rushed. I couldn't enjoy my food because I felt like the servers where just walking robots trying to get everyone in and out.   Because of all these things, I probably won't come to this location again especially if there's another location more convenient and less hectic.",

They have a special tonkotsu-shoyu ramen and it was greaaat. The broth was amazing and there was enough goodies in the ramen to make me full! They also have some rice bowls (we tried a small pork belly to share amongst the 5 of us). Even the \"small\" bowl was a pretty decent size. We were full!  Wait for our food wasn't too bad at all and we were in & out in about 30-45 mins. We sat at the bar and was able to watch them cook everything - fascinating!  Go-to ramen place in Vegas? DEF.",

I got the Tonkotsu Ramen with thin noodles. The noodles were perfectly cooked, a little chewy and a little bite, amazingly done. The broth was not salty at all, perfectly seasoned. I also got an added egg which was soft boiled and added to the creaminess texture of the soup. The service is the only knock, but understandable since the place was packed out for a Tuesday night. I will definitely be back!  This place rocks.",

Nitimago soft boiled egg is USUALLY perfect, occasionally over cooked but it's rare. Kimchee is good and I highly recommend the gyoza dumplings, order them the second you sit, before you look at your menu, because they take a while. The black garlic ramen is also amazing and the rice bowls with pork belly/chashu are also good but I always return to their amazing tonkatsu ramen with thick noodles, chewy, extra chashu and nitimago, my favorite ramen of all time!",

I was lucky enough to wait only 10 minutes, because the two parties before me weren't there when their names were called. The restaurant is tiny with around 10 items on their menu. They focus on ramen with two types of broth and other rice bowl dishes. Unlike their wait, the service is quick and efficient. We ordered the shoyu ramen with corn, large pork belly rice bowl and chashu bowl. The Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen had a deep and thick broth. The pork belly rice bowl was delicious! The thin and tender pieces of pork were cooked to perfection and the fatty components melted in your mouth. The juices from the pork travel down to the rice and leaving enough flavor for you to even eat the rice alone. The Mentaiko bowl was a great contrast to the ramen. However, the Mentaiko is very salty and they don't give you much.",

    "text": "Very very solid ramen in Las Vegas! It's essentially in a strip mall, but I get the sense that this is the deal with a lot of restaurants off the strip in LV. There was a wait when I arrived (around 1pm on EDC weekend, so I anticipated this), and the place was very very small which meant waiting outside in 110+ degree heat... ramen is always worth the wait though! One thing I would suggest is to reorganize a bit so there is more room for waiting inside, and perhaps if possible find a way to keep more of the AC inside... I was happy I wasn't seated near the door because you were definitely feeling the hot air!   Anyway, the food... I ordered the miso and asked to add spicy paste - it wasn't listed as an add-on for the menu but they were happy to accomodate. The broth was rich, salty, and tasty, with a strong miso flavor which I really appreciated. Sometimes \"miso\" ramen just tastes like \"salty\" ramen lol - not the case here. The spicy sauce was a great choice, it had a nice garlicky flavor and blended well into the soup. The pork was delicious and well-cooked, but the portion wasn't as  large as I might have liked. The noodles were excellent! The miso comes with the wavy noodles and this is my personal preference, so I really enjoyed them. Very chewy and well cooked. There was also a healthy portion of menma, a delicious ajitama, and a piece of nori included. Probably should have just added more chashu for only $2.50... but I didn't think of it.   I also ordered gyoza which were not very memorable, maybe a little oily, but a nice side option if you need more food.   All around a good option if you can make the trek off-strip!",

The egg was cooked just right, it was running and I loved how it was perfect with the soup..  The noodles had a good bounce to it , but the pork had too much fat.  I felt like my portion of the pork was small and didn't have much meat.  It had more fat than meat, which is why I lowered my rating.   However, when i come back here, I need to try their Kimchi fried rice, the table next to me ordered it  and it looked soooo good!!  It takes a while for the food to come, so if you super hungry prepare to wait.  When i left this place, i saw there was a large crowded gathered outside.  I'll make note of that the next time i'm back",

    "text": "I'm always up for Ramen wherever I go.  You don't really think of eating ramen when your in Vegas but there are several good places in sin city.  I tried Monta when they were part of the crappy ramen festival last summer.  I got a bowl but by the time I got it I did enjoy it very much.  I wanted to give them another shot so I decided to hit this place up for a fresh bowl of noodles.  Like most ramen houses the place is small and the night we went there was a slight wait.  Gyoza ~ <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ#q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a> Of course you have to get some because it just goes well with Ramen.  These were pretty good with a crisp char.  Kuro ~ <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#d9BleP8jELt3GECw45RQyA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a> Which is tonkotsu with black mayu (garlic oil).  Because its tonkotsu/hakata broth the noodes are the straight white ones.  Broth was good.  Not really salty.  The black mayu brought out a nice garlic flavor.  Good amount of kikurage and bamboo shoots.  The chasu had a good equal amount of fat and meat with a good flavor to it.  It didn't come with ajitama so I had planned to order one on the side but totally forgot.  Would have liked to taste it to see how it compared to other places.  Shoyu ~ <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q#2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>  Friend ordered the shoyu.  It had a great tasting broth.  The noodles were the yellow chijiri type.  It was slightly overcooked but it was pretty good.  Service was hit and miss.  Usually you get your gyoza before ramen but we got it the other way around.  We also had ordered ice tea and soda but that never came.  It was taken off the bill.   Overall it was a decent bowl of ramen.  Since this is the first ramen spot I tried in Vegas I cant compare to the other places in the city.  I will stick with a 4 star for now.   Eyes ~ Small place with lots of hungry peeps! Nose ~ Smells good!. Ear ~ Happy diners chatting and grubbing! Mouth ~ Ahhhh Ramen!! Tummy ~ Satisfied.",

All ramen options are pork-based. While not a place for vegetarians, Monta is a great spot for a hangover cure after too much partying. The consensus from my carniovore/omnivore buddies was that the broths were tasty but a tad too salty towards the end. One friend observed a person eating rice on the side with his/her ramen, perhaps a good solution to the saltiness.  Because I didn't have a non-meat option for soup, I got two bowls of the mentaiko on rice instead. Mentaiko atop rice is nowhere near as tasty as the noodle version. Also, butter seemed to missing from the fish egg mixture. I probably won't order this again if I return. The vegetable gyozas are probably worth trying, though.  Service is pretty good for such a fast-paced dining environment; the staff really know how to manage lines and to keep things moving along without being rude or giving you the impression that you were being kicked out. I'd definitely recommend this to any person looking for a soothing soup after a night of endless drinks.",

A side of kimchi could be a hit or miss because sometimes the they you like 2 pieces of kimchi and other times there'll be a lot. The ramen itself comes with the noodle, broth, mushroom, bamboo and two pieces of the pork slice. It's has a pretty awesome flavor. My friend and I always share the a big pork belly bowl as well. Which when you add a lot of pickled ginger, it is to die for. So when it comes to food, they're pretty awesome. But the service is a bit crappy.  They're really poor with service.  I think we saw them twice in our visit. Taking our order and giving us the check. Not that I need them to baby sit me but a water refill would be appreciated.  Also they can't use your card unless it's $10+ so bring cash when you can.",

Straight to the point...it's not good  Ramen was salty and charge extra to make it spicy. The fried rice had a burnt taste to it. Maybe I would've somewhat ate it if it was an after taste but No it was the taste. Menu sucks and service sucks. They said goodbye while we still eating and dropped the check.  I also ordered oolonghot tea. Came in a hot ass can that's waiting for a lawsuit and on top of it they didn't give me a hot tea cup. They gave me a regular plastic cup.  Atmosphere also sucks  After eating here I'm still craving ramen.  Never coming back here again. Just go to Jinya Ramen to avoid disappointment.",

My favorite is the shoyu/tonkotsu ramen with extra pork and I also order the fried rice to go with it. Potstickers aren't bad either and they've got plenty of condiments to keep your food tasting great. Service is good, but fair warning; this place is ridiculously small. There's almost always a line outside so it's best to get there right when they open so you can get in and get out. It's got the reputation of being the BEST ramen in all of Las Vegas and in my opinion, it lives up to its name. Give them a try Yelpers!",

    "text": "This is my new favorite place for ramen, and it's unfortunate that Monta is located so far away. Or is it? I say it's just another good reason to visit Vegas... again. I'm not a ramen expert, but I've had my fair share of ramen throughout LA and OC (though Daikokuya in LA is up there). Everyone has their own style of ramen, coming from different regions in Japan. My favorite just happens to be tonkatsu-style ramen.  After waiting about a half hour to get seated in this hole-in-the-wall, we were slurping away. The price of $6.95 per bowl is a steal, but if you want to add extras it can easily go up to $10+. I had the tonkatsu-shoyu, and I found the broth to be perfect. Deep, rich flavor, while not too heavy or salty.   My particular bowl of ramen came with thin noodles, which were okay. I kept reaching over to steal some of my wife's shoyu bowl, which had the standard, curly-style ramen noodles. Those had a nice, al dente chew, and I just loved how it clinged onto the flavors from the broth. Of course, what did I do after I was finished with my bowl? I had to order an extra side of curly ramen noodles for $1.50. Well worth every penny.  The other part worth mentioning is the slices of pork in the ramen. I'm used to the thick, fatty slices of pork belly. At Monta, the pork is so thinly sliced that it just melts and falls apart as soon as you try to pick it up with chopsticks. It's a shame that you only get 2 slices with the bowl. Next time around, I'm ordering extra.   I can just imagine my face dripping with sweat if I'm slurping down Monta ramen in 110+ Vegas heat in the summer. I was dripping with sweat in 70 degree winter weather in November! At any rate, it's definitely worth the short drive from the Strip, the sweat, and the wait to eat at Monta ramen.",

Like everyone else says, the wait can be seriously bad-- it's a small space, and though they do their best to move everyone through asap, the food takes time to come out (as it should!). It doesn't help that if you're there with a group, you're probably going to end up ordering extras to try once you've had anything on the menu.",

It was FREEZING in here, they have the fans on blast, way too cold for both of us.  But once they serve you the steaming goodness in a bowl it does warm up a bit, but not that much. Tip-move the fans to the kitchen to help the workers out but it was too cold for us.  I ordered my Pork Ramen w/out mushrooms and they placed the wrong bowls in front of us, my dinner companion was about to take a bite and the waitress like snagged it out from under him to swap ours around.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing. It has to be at least 3 cups of liquid, plus noodles and some very small bits of pork.  Get yours with the hard boiled egg.

We understand we have to venture out and try new things. I will say that the fact that this place has so many 4 star and above reviews is what drew me to give it a shot. I saw this highly recommended by anther elite and figured it would be credible.   We sat at the bar and immediately took our order as we were starving. High notes: the portions are excellent. That being said I would prefer a less amount of better ramen than too much mediocre ramen. We ordered fried rice on the side and gyoza in addition to a bowl of spicy tonkatsu and shoyu. The fried rice was strange and had WAY too much egg in it. It looked more like a scramble. The spicy level of the tonkatsu bowl ( they only have one level) was laughable. We can only add more of the Chile oil but that won't do anything. I will vouch   for the toppings which were premium. I like a lot of toppings but not so much that it overwhelms the noodles and base.  My shoyu broth was bland and thin. The noodles were too thick although it is advertised as medium. The base broth was not salty but lacked so much flavor. I had so much high hopes for this little hole in the wall place.   It was an underwhelming visit and we won't be back.",

Their fried rice, gyoza and cold noodles are also amazing! The prices here are very very reasonable! If you just get two bowls of ramen, you can easily spend less than $20! This place gets really busy but somehow he wait isn't so long. People there usually are in and out. So don't be scared away by long lines, it usually goes fast and it is super worth it!",

We ordered extra for just $2.50 and 4 large pieces came and we got it grilled and added to the leftover broth.  He was so happy.  Bear in mind that this place is tiny.  There is going to be a long wait during peak dining hours.  We were a family of 4 and had to wait 30 minutes at 5:30pm on a Thursday and eventually got seated at the bar because we didn't want the kids to wait any longer for a table.  It was worth the wait.",

I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen with extra chashu pork. The noodles were thin noodles and it was cooked to my liking. It's not too soft or too hard. The chashu pork was thinly cut, very tender and super fatty. I regretted ordering extra chashu pork. The broth was thick and extremely salty. I had to down half a cup of water after eating four bites. I couldn't eat it anymore so I left the bowl as in.",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best ramen places in Vegas for their Tonkotsu shoyu ramen! Whenever we make a trip down to Vegas this is the first place we hit up!  We love their Tonkotsu shoyu ramen, the broth and noodles are perfect in every way! The broth is creamy and the Tonkotsu and shoyu flavor are equally balanced. The noodles that come with this ramen is straight skinny noodles and compliments the broth very well. It is not too al dente and not too soft, just the right consistency. Keep in mind ramen comes with wood ear mushrooms, green onions, two slices of pork, and bamboo shoots only. Additional toppings will be extra charge.  Shoyu ramen was the other we ordered and this is with chicken broth. It was good but not as good as the Tonkotsu shoyu ramen, maybe because the broth had a lighter flavor. This came with curvy noodles that was perfectly al dente, just the way I like it. We also like to order their fried rice which is quite tasty. It has eggs, pieces of pork, and onions.  Although, food is delicious just be aware that there will be a wait as this place is tiny (maybe seats up to 25 people). Parking lot is shared amongst other restuarants so finding a parking space maybe difficult.",

I always get the black garlic ramen. It is so good! If you come here you have to get this ramen. Every time I bring my friends, they end getting it and loving it. I've tried the other ramen places in town and this is definitely better than all the others. I love how there is a Kung-Fu Tea next to it too because while you wait in line you can order boba. Or you can have it as dessert.   The only thing I hate about this place is the parking. This place is located in a plaza with other good places so it is always busy and there is never enough parking. Regardless, I love this place so much that I will suffer through the pain of finding parking just to eat here.",

The lot was full and didn't look like anyone was leaving any time soon. As you walk in there's a sign in sheet. They are very strict about having the whole party present and hearing for your name.  I ordered the tonkatsu and the pork belly bowl. SO GOOD! The noodles were thin and homemade. The broth tasted as if it was stewing for hours. The pork belly tasted delicious, as well as the rice.  The price was very affordable and the customer service was great! They were very helpful and knowledgeable about their menu. I would definitely come back here!!",

BUT, I had a change of heart after finishing a full bowl of their MISO RAMEN! It was delish! Oh em gee! I love it!!! Considering how big the bowl was,  the price of $7+ is CHEAP!    My hubby ordered a bowl of ramen that had a garlic based broth (sorry I forgot the name). The flavor was too strong although my husband loved it. Overall, two thumbs up for this place. Woohoo!

We ordered Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen with extra Choshu pork and Nitamago, fried rice and gyoza. They were perfect. The cost of everything including drinks was fairly good, too. We're not spending that much. This will be my new must-go place when I crave for Japanese ramen.",

    "text": "Can see why there's a lot of buzz about this place because their ramen is definitely on top of my list! The space is located in a plaza behind the strip, where you will also find Kung Fu Tea and a shaved snow place (forgot what it's called).  Like many ramen places, the space is small. I came here with a party of 7 on a Friday for lunch just right when it opened and our wait was about 25 minutes. It's a great place for a casual meal and more ideal for smaller parties. Our party of 7 ended up splitting up, where 3 of us sat at the counter and 4 of us sat at a table (which we were totally okay with but just a heads up for people who prefer to have a more of a catch-up session!).  For their ramen, they offer quite a few different kinds from Tonkatsu, Shoyu, Black Garlic Oil and Spicy. I was torn between their Black Garlic Oil and Spicy ramen and decided to get their Black Garlic Oil with spicy sauce on the side. Portion was decent- it's probably considered a medium bowl you would see at most noodle places. Each ramen comes with a good amount of bamboo shoots, mushrooms and green onions. Their broth had hearty, savory pork flavor (just like how all solid ramen broth should be). At first, I was worried that the black garlic oil would be too heavy and overpowering but surprisingly I thought the garlic flavor was a lovely element to their both. Noodles were thin and firm, also similar to traditional ramen places.   I also got a hot tea, which comes in a can rather than in a pot. Price wise, I can't remember the exact amount but I do remember thinking it was only a LITTLE bit more pricey than the usual places I go to. But if anyone needs a hangover fix and needs a break from all the madness that may happen on the Strip, I do suggest trying this place!",

I had attempted to go one time before, but when we got there it was a 2 hour wait and I was not in the mood for waiting it was freezing outside and that's the only place you can wait, so we ended up at another spot. Trying to park here is horrible! We had to park across the street and hope we didn't get towed. We attempted again, this time it was raining but I was determined to see what all the hype was about. So this time the wait was about an hour. It is very small so that explains the wait. We're finally inside and seated, it's so loud in there I felt I was yelling when putting in my order and I couldn't hear the waitress when she did talk to me.  Our food was at our table in no time, I want to say maybe within 10 minutes. I ended up getting the spicy ramen which was pretty good and I was full and satisfied with the serving but they do offer extra noodles. I'm glad I can say I tried it.",

The ramen was not as spicy as I would have liked, but that was easily fixed with the chili powder that's placed at each table. I will say..

Back home in Honolulu there is an explosion of really good ramen but at a price. I always go for the basic to test the broth. So I went with the shoyu ramen... Basic and because it's just broth and noodles it has to shine with prep and care. Dam... This was excellent! They had the correct noodles cooked perfectly, nice flavorful soy broth, clear, not to salty, hot! I barely said keadama when I fresh bowl of noodles arrived after finishing the initial batch. Dam good. I'd go back and order that 100 times if I didn't want to try the rest of the menu. I did try the gyoza of course... Meh, good but nothing special. Tried the kimchee fried rice... Needs more kimchee, and I don't exactly expect really good fried rice at a ramen joint... Although back in Honolulu the best fried rice come from ramen places. The ramen is killer... Like Goma Ichi back in Honolulu my first love in ramen. Feeding 3 peeps got out of there under $35...dam good!",

Broth: The tonkotsu broth was relatively creamy and flavorful.  Not the best I've ever had, but it was definitely the best part of my bowl. Noodles: I wasn't impressed. I expected hand-made or at least fresh noodles; mine were either over cooked or not the freshest. Pork: Quite good. Fatty, how it's best served. Egg: Thumbs down for this barely seasoned egg.  I debated between giving 3 or 4 stars on this review. I decided on 3 due to hype and lines; if I had randomly come across this place and wandered in, I think I would've enjoyed it more due to lower expectations.  Oh well.. on to the next bowl elsewhere!",

It was served in a small bowl with rice. I ordered miso ramen with pork chashu and a boiled egg. The ramen was perfect.   I felt like I needed to rush, since there wasn't much seating. If you're looking for a place to go with a big group of friends you may have trouble getting seated. There is maybe enough room for 40 people. So grab your few closest friends and go get a table.",

The restaurant itself is very cute and homey. There was a good amount of people when we arrived. Luckily for us, they had all ordered and were receiving their order when we placed our food.  The menu is small - a couple different styles of ramen, a couple of add ins, a handful of appetizers, including fried rice. From my experience, simple is usually good. It means that they make whatever they make very well.  My extra chasiu made the broth a little fatter than I would like; however, the broth was good - not too rich or heavy, and all the toppings in the ramen was fresh. The gyoza was made to order and same with the fried rice (which somehow ended up being my favorite part).  It was so good that we came back, once more, during our 3 days Vegas getaway before returning back to the Bay.  Oh... make sure your party isn't too big. The restaurant is very cute and homey, but it gets harder to accommodate large parties. (And if you have a large party and they accommodate you, please make sure you're in and out, as a respect to the restaurant and other guests they will serve).",

Place is small with approx 6-8 tables and there are seatings at the counter which we ended up at. There are no other appetizer except for gyoza. We order kurt ramen black garlic oil with thick noodles, extra eggs, Miso rame & Takana fried rice. The fried rice didn't hit the marked either since it tasted a little vinegary & salty . Both noodles bowls were also very salty, I can't even tasted my garlic flavor because the salty ness over powered everything else. This place can be good since noodles texture, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots are the same as anywhere else. Glad I try it out but would never come back or recommend to friends.",

    "text": "Ah, I finally stopped by this popular ramen shop to see how it competed with the best of SoCal. Although I don't think it beats out some of my California favorites, Monta Ramen is a solid ramen shop...just be mindful of the wait.  +Let's talk about pricing first. I got the tonkatsu ramen for a pretty reasonable price ($8.50) that includes a mixture of kikurage, bamboo, green onions and two pieces of chasu. It's a bit light on the items it comes with, which is a little bit unfortunate. I added egg and extra chasu for about $3.50 more. You can get drinks here for fairly cheap. Beer is only about $3 but note that they only have Asahi/Bud. They also have a number of side dishes, some coming in different sizes like gyoza to a chasu bowl. They also have a number of different ramen types which look interesting. +Flavor-wise, I think the tonkatsu ramen was really solid. The broth had a simple but filling flavor. The chasu nearly seemed to melt in your mouth with the fat easily tearing off as you chew. Not the 'softest' chasu I ever had but comes pretty darn close. I did think adding extra chasu (which was about another 4-5 pieces) seemed a little overkill though for me personally. The noodles were pretty good although didn't stand out as anything different that you might expect. They have a variety of regular condiments for you to use from ginger to sauces.  +Staff was friendly and attentive. Loved seeing the kitchen from the bar area as in most ramen places.    +/- Seating (which I'll mention again below) is tight. There's a small bar area and a few tables. Don't expect to bring a huge group here. +/- Parking is in the same plaza as a few other popular restaurants like Raku. It didn't seem overly busy in the daytime but it's definitely a tighter space for parking to be mindful of.  +/- Note they have a $10 credit card minimum.   -Man, this place is small. I came about 11:45AM (15 minutes after opening) and it already was a 25 minute wait. Those who came right after had to wait longer for sure. Be mindful of this when you stop by and especially with the hot summer months, you might be waiting out in the hot weather.  -Again, as noted above, don't expect too many toppings on your ramen as in some other places.   All-in-all, a pretty solid spot with a good wait. Come early, eat happy!",

I finally tried Miso and I thought it was amazing and actually has a better taste than Tonkatsu. Only I prefer the straight noodles served with Tonkatsu instead of curly Ramen noodles with Miso.  With my Miso, I had green onions, corn and takana mustard leaf! The taste was flavorful and decadent with a touch of spice!   The following week, I ordered my Miso with my favorite noodle along with my extra vegetable components just like my last visit but forgot to add the mustard green. I swore up and down to the chef that they gave me Tonkatsu because Miso was spicy last time.  Well, after a discussion with the chef we realized that the takana mustard leaf presented the spicy flavor to the broth, which was forgotten!   I am astonished how one element can change the flavors!   Cheers to the chef for helping me figure that out and making a fresh batch of Miso with my extra kicks.

    "text": "Whenever I wanted to eat ramen in Las Vegas the best option was to stay home and cook a bag of Maruchan. Why is that you ask? Because at least then I'm already prepared to be disappointed. The ramen scene in Vegas is not that great, there are few choices of where to go and even fewer options of what type to order.  Hearing from my friends that we were planning to visit a new ramen place I got quite excited. Were we finally going to find a place worth eating ramen at after all these years? The simple answer, yes.  As soon as I walked into Monta I knew that this was going to be a place we would eat again. The decor was simplistic in nature and at the same time very enchanting. There were few seats, maybe 26 at most, but you didn't feel cramped at all. We chose to sit at the bar seating and got a great view of the chefs at work.  A first look at the menu told me that there were three different types of ramen to choose from. This may not seem like a lot but accompanying that was a decent sized list of sides that you can add for a small price. As my nickname is Miso, I decided to stay True to it and order the miso ramen. I requested no bamboo shoots or mushrooms, that come with the order at no extra cost along with some slices of pork. I also decided to add an egg to my order because egg in my opinion makes everything better.  The staff there was very upbeat and happily took our orders. They were very chatty with each other, but not in a bad way. This is the kind of staff that you know they enjoy their work. If anyone needed a refill on their drink the staff was very quick to notice and refill them without any trouble.  As the food arrived all of us looked at our food putting off the first bite in fear of being disappointed once again by another bowl of ramen, boy were we wrong. The first bite was amazing and with that we began to devour our dinner with gusto. The flavor of the miso was a little on the salty side but not so much to over power it. The noodles were prepared well and the texture was enjoyable. The egg that I had ordered did not disappoint, and the pork was a pleasure to eat. The size of the order was enough to make me content. Had I wanted more there was an option for more noodles for $2.00, which is not that bad at all.  Overall the experience at Monta was a great one. It may not be the best ramen out there, but it is for sure the best ramen you are going to find here in Vegas. The pricing is reasonable, the order came out to under $10.00, and the food did not disappoint. If you are looking for some good ramen, Monta is the place to go in town! We will most definitely be making return visits in the future!",

Monta practically became my go to place to get my ramen fix. I felt terrified when I heard they had health code violations but glad they quickly solved the issues and reopened! They always have had great service and decently priced items on their menu.",

    "text": "Tiny hole in the wall that is located next to Raku.  It is Osaka style stringy ramen, swimming happily in a savory white Tonkotsu (Pork Bone) broth, not to be confuse with Tonkatsu (Pork Cutlet).  It is created from slow roasted pork bones. You can add sides such as corn, butter, pickled vegetables.  I asked for the roasted chastu pork, medium boiled egg and nori.  The roasted pork melts into the broth creating a symphony in your mouth and the egg was cook to perfection with the yolk still bright orange.  This is definitely a place where I will come back again but it is like a typical ramen shop.  One thing I have to add is that, they do not serve very large portions, so if you're hungry be sure to get an appetizer.  Sits 20 people, the open at 11:30am and full house by 12:30.  Service was friendly and menu is basic and simple.",

If youre confused about what ramen is, its just noodles and broth and you get to pick your additional toppings or mix ins or whatever. This place has a chicken broth, a pork broth, or half and half. Its acually really good. It is a little salty, and I wish they had a few more choices for the additional add ins, but I would definitely go back. It is a tiny place, and they wont seat you unless the whole party is there.",

We asked to try their hot sauce that they put in soup, the waitress gave us a little bit of the spicy sauce on the side, in the end they charged us for a $1 for that super small sauce plate. she could have warned us if it was that small, at least two teaspoon... I've had better in vegas.. I've tried ramen sora and it is way better. Only down the street not too far. *sorry for grammars*",

Not impressed the soup was dull, the pork flavor did not jump out , kinda muddled flavors. Did not care for the noodles , don't know what type it was , but wife had the miso ramen and those noodles were the ones I'm used to eating little more rubbery bite(chewy). Even the miso ramen flavors were weak.  Also had the pork belly bowl , I liked the flavors of this dish jus wish the pork was sliced a little thicker.   The one good thing was the bill was only $21 . Service was good.         I miss togashi ramen and their mabo tofu ramen :( , well the search goes on for ramen....",

I went here a couple days ago and decided to go for the suggested:  Tonkatsu - Broth was Tasty and Creamy, resembled a Miso type soup. Noodles were great. The Pork was awesome, it was extremely tender!  Shoyu - Broth was much darker than the Tonkatsu and had a slight soy sauce type flavor but a bit salty for my taste. Noodles great as well. The Pork definitely the highlight!  Pork Belly Bowl (Regular Size) - First of, I'm so glad I ordered the full size than the small. I love Yoshinoya Beef Bowls and this was a Glorified version of it! This is a 100% Must Try  Gyoza - Great Starter, just dip it in a bit of soy sauce and enjoy..",

I've been lucky to have come here each time to have to wait only 2-5 minutes, and only to have been seated to be thankful I escape the crowd of line suddenly waiting.

My kindergarten aged daughter's new favorite eatery. :)  I've been coming here with my family on and off now since opening, and even though the broths and noodles are still very tasty, the quality of the soups and other items have been hit/miss over the last year or so.  Used to be that we'd always order the takana rice and gyoza, but both of those taste like microwaved foods now (even though freshly made - if you watch the kitchen).  The broths are still very tasty, but sometimes overly salty, sometimes not enough.  Hit/miss, like I said.  Stay away from the shoyu and miso version if you don't need extra sodium.  Normally I just get the tonkotsu with corn, nitamago, and takana on the side (self-add for saltiness).  If I'm there with my daughter, then I get an extra order of noodles to share - broth is usually enough for two decent sized bowls.    Seating at the counter is still the most fun - especially with young(er) kids.  But being that the restaurant is tiny (only has five 4-tops I believe and 9 or 10 counter seats), groups larger than 2 usually wait a while.    Still a great ramen place to sit down and slurp in some noodles on cool Vegas nights though!  Just stick to the basics!",

This place is popular with the locals and frequent Vegas visitors.  The hype is no bull and regrettably if you arrive after 5 pm, there are clusters of hungry ass people waiting for an open seat outside & inside.  And dammit, I will wait.  You cannot go wrong ordering the shoyu ramen, unless you space and not ask for extra char siu aka \"juicy pork butt\".  To really have a ramen equivalent of the \"Calgon-take-me-away\" dreaminess, get extra char siu, egg, nori, menma (marinated bamboo shoots).  Their broth has been made the traditional way.  Really good broth doesn't require lots of salt or shoyu, just enough to enhance its flavor.  I rarely finish the broth, since most places make it way too salty but I cleared my bowl here.  One tip I will mention is the ramen will come with basic garnish of  green onions.  I made the mistake of ordering it as an extra, and I got a mound of jullienne scallions which was a bit onion overkill.  Their gyoza is excellent, and compliments a bowl of ramen so don't forget that too.  On top of all that yumminess, super cute&sweet servers that are fast on their feet to clear a table so I can devour more ramen when need be.",

    "text": "The first time I reviewed Monta almost 3 years ago (wow!), it was really my first experience with ramen.  Since then, ramen places have popped up all over the valley, giving Monta competition.  And, IMHO, the competition wins.  I won't name my favorite place in this review because we're not supposed to per TOS, but my most recent visit to Monta reinforced my higher regard for my favorite place down the street.  Not that Monta is terrible, mind you.  It has plenty of avid fans, my good friend being one; she doesn't like my favorite place at all.  We came here for lunch last week because she loves her some Monta; she comes here so often that the staff knows her order.  We arrived ten minutes before they opened on a Friday morning and there were already 25 people waiting in line!  Monta staff hand out a waiting list for everyone to sign in on, so that's how I know the number.  When we got in the doors, my friend and I plus one other couple were the last to be seated, so capacity in the joint is about 29 people, if my math is correct; this includes sitting at the counter.  We ended up at the counter and that was actually a fun place to be because we got to watch the cooks at work.  We both had the shoyu ramen and I added eggs and corn to mine.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food; I should have ordered an appetizer.  I usually get edamame, but they don't offer it on the menu--weird.  This is a very small space and once it fills up, the line is steady waiting for people to hurry up and eat.  It's been a while since I've been back here and the ramen is good, but given the choice, I choose the other place.",

I had the tonkatsu ramen with side of gyoza   broth was good, but noodles were too thin for my liking. Plus the broth had this wierd porky taste like unclean or unorganic pork. (trust me I cook a lot and know the difference) Think pigs in a dirty straw pin taste...yee  Anyhooo it was fine to try it and $30 out the door for 2 pl wasnt bad, but the best ramen i've had is still in LA Tsujita   Gyoza was good though- home made  ok to try once but wouldnt spend my $ there again.

Pros: Monta Ramen provides a traditional Japanese style ambiance with transparent view in kitchen that portrays confidence and quality in its product. Monta's Tonkatsu style ramen is delicious and perfectly prepared. The broth never gets old and is always ready to fulfill. Monta offers perfectly balanced side dishes (fried rice, gyoza, etc) and options to upgrade ramen dishes.  Service is quick and generally helpful.   Cons: The size of the restaurant is small and can be an issue when hosting larger parties. The wait time especially during prime hours (lunch and dinner) can be an issue. All parties must be present upon seating. Be weary of writing your name down on the clipboard; my party got overlooked recently and the host sat three parties before mine.   Overall, the quality of food trumps the service.  A must visit for tourists!",

    "text": "I crave Monta Ramen. It's a staple example of decently priced, quality, authentic food that's worth the comeback visit(s). Although fair warning, beware the wait times and lines for this anticipated and sought out food.      I have had most variations here and there, but I am a die hard miso fan and prefer to try the miso anywhere. There is only 4 broth bases to choose from along with the occasional special, as well as a nice side menu with a lot of other small dishes to choose from.   As for the Miso. The salty creaminess with those thick bodied noodles always fulfills the appetite and keeps the taste buds impatient to scoff down more. Simply comes with 2 pieces of Chatsu pork, bamboo shoots, scallions, and mushroom.  A little skimpy with pork in my opinion, but it temps me to order extra because it really is the best I've ever had. So rich and flavorful and tender. Fat and all should absolutely be savored. You must also pay for additional toppings such as butter, nori, etc. I either get a side of kimchi or the small pork belly bowl which is equally delicious and abundantly layered in a rice bowl.  I applaud the waitresses for their patience and kindness. The place is almost always beyond busy and full, yet they still handle and attend to customers quickly and with a good attitude.   I always recommend to friends, but this is a fairly fairly small venue for such popularity (they have also recently opened another one in Henderson) so either have a treat for adventurous self, or go with a few friends, but not very accommodating for very large parties.",

If you like high carb, high fat, high sodium foods, this is definitely the place to come to. Otherwise, you are better off eating a hamburger -- less damaging to your body.   My wife and I came and we ordered Shoyu Ramen, Tonkotsu Ramen and a regular fried rice.   Both Ramen have three pieces of CharSiu -- but they are not Charsiu, they are thin slices of pork belly. If you like pig fat, you will find this to be hog heaven.   Both the Miso Ramen soup and the Tonkotsu soup are very, very greasy and quite salty. The ramen noodle is of the thin variety that can be purchased from many of the Asian food markets. Both Ramen bowls are filled with scallion, bamboo shoots and seaweed.   In many other Ramen noodle houses, there is always a half marinated hard boiled egg that comes with the ramen dish, but not this one.  Pricing on the Ramen is quite reasonable -- about $7.00 each. However, I can't tell whether it is good tasting or not, when food is covered with grease and salt, my taste buds are over powered.   We also shared a regular fried rice. Again, it is quite greasy and the rice is bit too soft. Many other Asian restaurant can do a better job.    All in all, the rice is barely acceptable but the ramen is not.   A solid one star.",

But the biggest disappointment was the ramen itself.  This used to be my favorite bowl in town, but something changed....for the worse.  Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with butter and corn :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#q5T-X6g2S1AzgJT4FT0Vrg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>  It tastes a lot more \"instant\" now and the broth doesn't have that same depth that used to drive me crazy.  I even added butter and corn, and it still wasn't as flavorful as the other big dogs in town.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad Ramen, but it isn't notable anymore to me.

Toppings are fine (can't really mess those up). I also tried the Tonkotsu Shoyu... even saltier.  Mentaikodon - Hard to mess this up, since it's just rice + store bought mentaiko. Rice was so hard and dry. Get this at Ippudo instead.  Gyoza - Nothing special. Same as any other restaurant or frozen gyoza.

This place, if you follow my reviews, serves one of the most authentic Japanese dishes you can find in Dallas. Unfortunately a couple of years ago, the owner of this small restaurant passed away.  About 6 months ago, MON group, based in Las Vegas, decided to take over Mr Max and revived the restaurant, from there onwards, its full house every single day, you can read more about my review of Mr Max when you are free.  MON group operates several powerhouse Japanese restaurants in Las Vegas, Monta Ramen being one of them. This is a very tiny restaurant, perhaps housing only 30 people at any one time. But what makes this place so special is the Ramen. The Ramen is legendary tasty and 100% authentic. The tiny restaurant is almost like an exact replica of how a Ramen bar in the busy streets of tokyo would be like. Coupled with the hearty greeting of the japanese waiters and waitress, you might think that you have actually stepped into tokyo.  I've tried every single Ramen on the menu and i can tell you everything IS fantastic. 1500 reviews don't lie and let the pictures paint the story for you.  Did i mention that their Ramen cost less than 10 bucks a bowl? Dang, if you haven't tried authentic Ramen before, this IS the place to go.",

Their place is rather small and it's quite popular, so if they could just get another bigger location or something, it would be perfect. Sometimes there's a long wait, so it's a hassle to sit outside in the heat, but once we're in, and we have our food, it's all worth it! The food is inexpensive and delicious! I only want to also add that if your order is less than $10 or something, you cannot use your card, which was a huge inconvenience for me twice when I went.",

I loved the shoyu (i think thats what it was called) ramen. Amazing flavors to go along with the corn, egg, and onions I added to my ramen.  The second time I came, I had the miso ramen which was good but I didn't expect the broth to be as thick as it was.  I also asked for extra noodles that I thought was already thrown into the soup but it actually came on the side.  For $2.50 extra, I had more than enough noodles and just saved the rest for later.  As for the interior, its quite small but mimics the feel of how a real Japanese restaurant would be. Service is super nice and its in a good central location. So I'll be here a lot more often now that I've discover it. Thanks fellow Yelpers!!!",

My favorite is the shoyu, but I find myself ordering the miso every now and again.  Whichever broth you choose, I would definitely get an egg added.  Their spiced eggs are simply delicious.  I have not had any of their other menu items so I cannot comment on those.    The best thing about this place, other than the food, is the atmosphere.  The waitstaff  is friendly and quick and even all of the customers are in good spirits (it is hard not to be with ramen like theirs).  All in all, this is a fun place for any occasion.  Off work and don't want to cook? Monta Ramen.  Date night? Monta Ramen.  Just plain hungry? Monta Ramen.",

The quality of their noodles are really good. The noodles are not over or under cooked. The tonkotsu is my favorite! The menu is very simple with not a lot of options. But, everything on the menu is great!   The service here is also very good. The food comes to you very quickly. The establishment is relatively small so if it gets busy it could take a while for seating. If you have been to Japan, it has a typical hole in the wall ramen place to it. I like this place a lot more because it feels exactly like you are in Japan. Even the workers speak Japanese. But other than that, Monta Noodle House is one of the best tonkotsu ramen I have had. I have been going there for some time now and will definitely continue going there.",

    "text": "We went yesterday for lunch and the hubs wants to go back today. That pretty much sums it up. It was that good. We went with our two daughters, which enabled us to try most of the noodle offerings.   I had the Tonkotsu (not to be confused with TonKAtsu), my husband had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu and the girls both had the Miso. We also shared a pork belly bowl. Everything was spot on delish. The Tonkotsu is the heaviest, richest broth...delicious, but I think I'll wait until the weather cools before ordering it again. The Tonkotsu-Shoyu is a combo of the richer Tonkotsu and the lighter, clearer Shoyu broth. It had the richness from the Tonkotsu, but the Shoyu gave it a delicious brightness. We did not get to try the plain Shoyu as both girls insisted on Miso. The Misi was also very good, but did not out-shine the Tonkotsu-Shoyu. The toppings were perfect...thin slices of ultra tender chasu (pork), strips of mushroom and pickled red ginger (nothing like sushi ginger).  The Pork Belly Bowl was everything the name suggests. Tender, well seasoned pork belly atop sticky rice. So good. We like to sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds on top.  The service was fast, friendly and very welcoming. The place is tiny as are most noodle houses you find in Japan. We went at 2:30 in the afternoon and were able to get a table right away. (was almost hoping they'd be packed...forcing us to go to Raku *sigh* my fav, lol)  Heads up! As of June 1st they are offering Hayashi Chuka which is a cold Japanese noodle dish. Perfect for summer. We didn't order it this visit, but will definitely be headed back soon. It is a favorite of ours, but we've only had it in friends' kitchens. They serve canned soft drinks, and our whole family highly recommends you give the Calpico a go. It's tangy, almost reminiscent of the original tangy flavor yogurt at Red Mango or Pinkberry. Very refreshing :)",

Also the counter is made out of this beautiful hunk of nice solid wood. What is that? Walnut? It's nice.   So anyways. This place is located next a Korean BBQ and Raku. Makes me wonder if it's the same owner as Raku?   The ramen is okay. Anyone that has had the standard of ramen (Daikokuya in LA, hello?) will tell you that Monta isn't as good, but for Vegas, it'll do.   Monta only does three kinds of ramen: tonkatsu, shoyu, and miso (around $7-8). All are decent. The menu has short descriptions of each for us gaijin. There is also a short list of accouterment like egg, butter, corn, and spring onions available for nominal additional costs. I recommend the butter. It is exquisite.   The very limited menu has gyoza, mini mentaiko (around $3), kim chi fried rice (not very good). Sometimes they have specials written on the white board on the wall.   On the front of the menu, there's a short history of ramen. The reading lists the source: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Framenlicious.com&s=6decea11d280eae3bde6f552fed3165d7bebea36820355035765a044d15c8ce1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ramenlicious.com</a>  They have a few beers including Asahi and something domestic, maybe Bud. My friend got a $3 glass of Asahi. It was like a double shot of beer.    They do NOT make their own noodles, at least not on the day we came.   The unisex bathroom is practical and has a weird interior design nonsensicalness to it. Meh.   The joint is pretty small. A bar that accommodates eight and maybe five four-tops.   All of the staff is Japanese. One of the cooks looks hardcore prison cook with the burns all up and down his forearm. Heck yeah.   The restaurant is small and will possibly never have air conditioning. But there is a plethora of fans running and the back door remains open on the hottest of days. When some one opens the front door to leave or enter, the joint turns into a wind tunnel.   They're only open til 11p. I'm sure they could stay open later and do just fine with the late night belligerent crowd. \"Whoo, I'm so wasted! I need lots of calories in my system. Whoo!\"  Watch Tampopo.   * off the strip, non-casino",

It's reminiscent of a ramen shop in Japan in the decor, layout, line out the door from the moment it opens, and, most importantly, the taste.  This place could compete against some of the shops in LA or in San Jose.  And, like most of those places, they specialize in tonkotsu broth.  I had the tonkotsu shoyu, and my friends had the plain tonkotsu.  I'd actually recommend the tonkotsu - not as much going on, and you can taste the purity of the broth, which is quite good.  Not too strong (which is why the shoyu kind of overpowered it), but a little more subtle.  The garlic was at the counter, and I noticed it later, if you want a little more oomph in your broth.  The nitamago wasn't too strong, but nicely flavored as well.  Overall, a great find that I didn't expect.",

    "text": "Monta... I could rival Neruda with all the love poems I'd write about you.  Like most relationships though, our initial encounter was not ideal, at least on my part. I think it was because this was my first time trying \"authentic\" Japanese ramen, so I wasn't sure what to expect and left feeling unsure. However, our bond has solidified and deepened with each visit, each more yearning and wanting than the last.  Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen is my favorite ramen, and I like to relish it with most of the condiments they offer. The pork belly bowl is both sweet and savory. The gyoza is delicious, the pork inside perfectly cooked and rich. Thankfully they don't mark up their canned drinks too much so a party of 2 could get away with 2 ramen bowls and 2 drinks and the bill will come to $20, not including tip.  If you come here in the summer months, prepare to deal with stifling heat. Monta is so small and doesn't have the best air conditioning to battle the heat and since the place is packed all the time, it will definitely get stuffy. A bowl of hot ramen is more enticing in the cooler months. But no matter what time you visit, prepare to wait anywhere from 5-30 minutes for seating. Tables are of course preferable since they're more private and have more room, but you'll wait longer for one. The bar is great too.  Be prepared to get \"hurried\" in and out because as soon you're seated, your order will be taken and as soon it looks like you're done with your meal, waitresses will zip over and offer to take your bowl in a hurry to get the waiting guests seated. This isn't an ideal place to take your time chit-chatting with a friend for a long period. It IS a great place to get full on rich ramen and then be on your way to your next outing or errand.",

Short wait time, got our food as soon as it was ready, drinks were filled immediately when it goes empty. The food was not as great as I had expected. Which was a very big disappointment. It was good but mediocre on taste. The restaurant itself was ridiculously small. I was shocked how small it was. Poor hostess was trying to get tables going so she can sit more people. Since the restaurant was so small, you can smell the bathroom was close by also. Yuck! The other star is really for nothing, I was just trying to be nice... Maybe a star for how cozy the room was. Oh wait. The other star goes to how affordable it is, it's a good cheap place to have soup.",

If you haven't tried it you really should you won't regret it!!    This place is always packed (cause its great) so your probably going to have to wait especially if you have a large group, but trust me it's well worth it!!",

    "text": "I get a craving for Monta nearly once a week...Nah who am I kidding, it's more like a daily burn. If I lived closer to their Chinatown location, I would seriously consider a 5x a week lunch adventure, transporting me back to Japan with an enveloping nostalgia of aroma, atmosphere, personality, texture and UMAMI. Oh man, the umami. The wait (and there ALWAYS is one) is WELL worth it. Whether it's 10 minutes for lunch or a 30-60 minute wait for dinner, your olfactory glands, umami super sensors and full warm belly will thank you profusely.   I am a massive fan of the basic tonkotsu, always with a nitamago (soft boiled, soy sauce-seasoned egg), with a spicy iteration thrown in the routine every so often. I am also slightly obsessed with their kimchi fried rice, on which I pile on pink pickled ginger. They should probably start charging me for the pickled ginger, as I definitely take advantage of the free-for-paying-customers-with-the-notion-it-will-be-used-sparingly jar of the condiment/dish enhancer. $2.95 Asahi on tap?? Give me a couple!   Monta is incredibly well priced, intimate in a truly authentic Japanese way, lively, wicked efficient (in the manner they move customers in and out), clean and SO CONSISTENT. I will be back, in approximately 15 minutes! Damn Spring Mountain traffic!",

    "text": "I had a very bizarre experience here. When I arrived there was no host at the stand but I was told by one of the waitresses walking by to add my name to the sign in sheet. I added my name in the next available open slot, and joined the crowd of people who were standing around outside waiting to be called. 45 minutes pass and I see that a couple who had arrived after me is called in for the their table. I go inside to ask about my position and I see on the sign in sheet that they have literally skipped over my name and seated at least 12 people who had signed in after me. I'm bewildered at this point because I'm starving. So I flag down a man who appears to be a manager lurking in the back of the restaurant. He tells me that my name was skipped over because it was not written exactly within the lines on the sheet. Huh?? So you skipped me because my handwriting went over the line in my designated space? I was so utterly confused. With not so much as an apology, he tells me the only thing he can do is add me to the bottom of the list. Thankfully, a very nice couple who had witnessed the entire thing invites my fiance and I to share their four top. We were very grateful as we would have had to wait another hour just to be seated. How strange. The food was decent however, neither one of us eats pork so we ordered the chicken broth only to find out that they still add large hunks of pork within the soup even when you specifically request no pork. Also, I ordered corn and egg and received neither. The staff was very unapologetic and I found the manager to be quite rude. I'm thinking my experience may have been a fluke and I'm willing to give this place another try so I'll give two stars. Just remember to sign your name precisely within the lines of the sheet or you may risk being skipped over.",

I ordered the Kuro ramen (black garlic oil ramen) and it was possibly the best Kuro ramen I have had thus far. There is a restaurant that specializes in kuro ramen near my own home, but it does not compare to Monta's.   The food came out pretty fast, which is always awesome. The garlic was incredibly flavorful and aromatic and just amazingly delicious. Chashu was also really nice and tender. My only qualm was that the broth was a little salty for my own liking. I had to add some ginger and sesame seeds to cut the saltiness a bit, but other than that it was very, very good. If I had access to Mona Ramen close to my own home, I would eat there so much it would definitely not be too good for my blood pressure.  Can't wait to come back and try their tonkatsu and miso ramen as well!",

With the wait however, it just is not worth it suddenly. Especially because I am from Southern California, there are a lot more ramen places that is just as good, if not better, than Monta Ramen. But for the Las Vegas area, this has been the best place to get my ramen fix.   The broth is super fresh and clean, not filled with like oils and things like that. The meat is super soft, which just melts in your mouth. The noodles are just how I like them, RAMEN noodles.   One bowl is enough to satisfy your hunger.   Now to mention the wait - my family and I waited 50 minutes for ramen noodles. Factoring that in, it was not worth it. The waitress even let back people who \"left\" from the waiting list, and came back! That's not what a waiting list does, if a party leaves, they are off the list. The waitress would squeeze the party back in. That just lengthens the time I am waiting outside, especially since she did it for two 5 person parties before mine.   They have another Monta in Vegas now. Maybe that one is worth trying out.",

Located on Spring Mountain Road, this hidden gem is well tucked away in a strip mall.  It's comfort food for my fiance and I especially after the Bellagio buffet dinner on the night before.  The place was very small and there were people waiting when I got there.  They won't sit you unless all of your party are present which is nice so no one can hog up the table.  We ordered Tonkotsu ramen with extra ramen, and flavored egg, gyoza and takana fried rice.  Everything was excellent.  The takana fried rice was very different than the regular Japanese fried rice.  It has a very nice kick to the taste too.  My fiance and really enjoyed the food and would definitely come back whenever we are in town!  The place is cash only.",

I lived in Japan for 8 years, so as far as authenticity goes, this place takes the cake (or ke-ki). The waitresses and chefs are always welcoming and courteous, and you could tell they put a lot of love and effort in every dish that is served. There are items on the menu that I haven't seen since I lived in Japan, so Monta leaves a very special, nostalgic mark in my heart. They also remember their regulars and treat them like friends. So you'd think the price would match the golden service, but NO! It's so nice and cuddly on my wallet. My wallet wants to date the face off this place. I don't know many places that fix a huge bowl of noodles that could feed two people for just $6, and still taste awesome.",

Now this booming ramen shop is busier than ever, and the ramen is still top of its game.   Offering quick and cheap eats, this menu may be small, but there is nothing small about the taste. Kimchee fried rice is a must. Monta offers 4 different broths, numerous toppings as well as sides and like gyoza, fried rices, bowls, etc. Definitely one of my favs",

As i eagerly waited for my dish and the  impending orgasmic party in my mouth, i was a bit disappointed as i shoveled the black garlic noodles in my face.  Nothing happened. No heaven, no eyes rolling behind my head, no happy ending. Sorry guys. Yelp is normally pretty accurate but these reviewers are having way too much fun and i feel a little bit left out. I thought it was too starchy and salty. It was good but not 5 star great. I did like the flavored egg; it was gooey goodness.  Would i do it again? Probably not. Perhaps my expectations were too high. Perhaps the chef forgot the crack in my soup base. Service was good, ramen was good enough. Try it for yourself.  Maybe you'll get lucky and leave with a happy ending. Btw. I did like the kimchi fried rice a lot but the portion was small. Its more of an appetizer. Its pretty good, order one for yourself and don't share because you'll crave for more. I would rate this establishment 3.5 stars.",

The tonkotsu broth simply can't be beat, and the chasu pork atop the ramen is the most tender I've found. I typically add the corn and the hard-boiled egg (nitamago). If you're in the mood for more than just ramen, the kimchi fried rice and the potstickers are both excellent starters.  This place gets crowded. Like, insanely crowded. Line out the door. If you're planning to stop by for lunch, you better be waiting outside before they open at 11:30am. But even if you do have to wait for a table or a counter seat, trust me, it will be worth it.",

Came here during Sunday lunch and had a 30 minute wait in the small shop that probably seats 30.  Service was fairly quick, got my food within 5 minutes of ordering.  Fried rice was really good, would definitely get again.  Got the ramen with thick noodles- thanks fellow yelpers for the recommendation.  The thick noodles are the normal size at other restaurants- nice and chewy.  Broth was good but not as creamy as other places I've been to.  Wished the pork slices were smoked like at Totto, would have added to the flavor.",

    "text": "Visited this small restaurant based on popular review. Indeed, this restaurant is so popular that you will have to wait in the line. Another reason why you'll have to wait is that the dining room can probably fit about 30 dining guests at each time, half of the guests will need to be on the bar table. Me and my wife are lucky to get a table after about 45 minutes of wait with about 6 parties waiting in front of us for dinner (by the way, you will need to check yourself in as there are only 2 very busy waitresses). The menu was very simple - noodle, fried rice or some small variety of specialty. There are flyers if 2 today's special pasted on the wall, which we ordered - spicy tonkotsu ramen. We also ordered a mini mentaiko bowl (basically some fish eggs with sesame over small bowl of rice). I would not say it is super delicious, but it is really worth the price. The ramen was very flavorful (can be a little salty). You also have the option to add another noodle if you still feel hungry after you finish the bowl - I think most people will do since there was actually not much noodle in it. For us, the bowl of rice does the job. The rice is nothing special and almost had no flavor. I just seasoned the rice with the broth of the ramen I had. Overall, not bad, and it is definitely worth the price. But if you don't have much time in Vegas, you can safely skip this place as it is not worth that much of wait, unless you really want to save money in your trip.",

Got the Tonkotsu-Shoyu and just asked for corn, but she charged me for it and I never got it.. but that's okay cause the charsiu was so good I didn't care! Have the choice of 3 different broths and either thick or thin noodle... I opted for thick and the bf got the thin with the miso broth... not a fan of miso but it was good. Mine was better.  Very small place though, not really good for large parties. And easy to miss when trying to locate... But food comes out quick! And very reasonable pricing. Love it. Should try the rest of the menu, but this small bowl of ramen is pretty filling...  If you haven't been, you must try.  Why not 5 stars? I dunno... maybe when I sample more items I will reconsider.",

The thing is, I really wish this website allowed half star ratings, because I would have rated it 3 1/2. What really brings it down in my mind are the noodles.  The atmosphere was fine and the staff are friendly. But the noodles... They are too starchy and separated, and not very fresh-tasting. Frowny face. The broth, however, was something else entirely. Our bowl of Tonketsu ramen was perfectly salty and flavorful, and the texture of the broth wasn't grainy or too fatty.  The other toppings and chashu pork were fine, but in my opinion, the chashu at Ramen Sora down the street is far superior. All in all, it certainly wasn't a bad eating experience, but I didn't enjoy my noodles very much, and man can not live on broth alone.",

Other than ramen on the menu, you can get some fried rice or fried pork to munch on. Variety is always better when theres more than one belly at the table. Seating is very limited.. we are talking about 5 tables and a bar to fit 10 people total so be prepared to wait for a table to open.  Too cheap to not come and stop by for some fast served ramen! =d",

    "text": "This was my first meal in Vegas and it was really good! Finding parking here was kinda annoying since the parking lot for this shopping center was small. We were actually surprised that we were able to be seated right away as a party of 5. When we left there was a line going outside the door, so I'd either come early or expect a wait because this place is super tiny inside (there's a few tables and then bar style seating).   Looking over the menu, I was shocked at how cheap the ramen was. But then I realized that the ramen is very basic -- broth, 2 slices of pork, green onions, ramen and bamboo shoots. If you want extras like egg, extra pork, corn, kimchi, etc. you'll have to pay extra. But even after adding toppings my food still came out to be like $10.   We started off sharing a pork belly bowl as a table. It was pretty good! As for my meal, I ordered the Miso ramen and asked for spicy paste on the side. I also opted to add the egg and corn.  After adding the spicy paste in my Miso ramen it tasted great and was full of flavor! The miso ramen also had the thick wavy noodles that I love.   Service was quick and efficient. I kind of got the vibe that they wanted us to leave quickly after paying the bill, but I can't really blame them with a line out of the door! If you're looking for an inexpensive meal that will fill you up then you should check out Monta Ramen!",

If the ramen falls below the Santouka standard, then I can forget about it.  How did Monta Ramen place on this scale?  Well, Monta came out on top.  There was no wow factor for my black tonkotsu ramen, but everything was done quite nicely.  The yolk was not overcooked.  The noodle had the right amount of chew.  The broth was flavorful.  Even though the ramen was good, it was not worth the long wait.  We arrived before opening time, and waited for about 30 minutes with the long line.  This place is definitely worth returning, and hopefully the wait is shorter next time.",

I added flavored egg and spring onion to my tonkatsu broth with wavy noodles but was disappointed by the noodle-to-broth ratio.  The broth was delicious but there was just not enough! I guess I don't mind being disappointed if the reason is not having enough. The pork in my ramen kind of tasted like uncured pork, which is definitely not my thing but I know some people love that. I did enjoy the pork belly over rice, the pork was well seasoned, but next time I would order the smaller size because the regular had a lot of rice.   Don't be fooled by the small size of this restaurant,   The service is fast and the wait is worth it! (We asked the hostess if she could flag is down while we waited in the car with our a/c on, and she was more than happy to oblige --- beat the heat!)",

I've never tasted anything so deliciously complex, and it's all contained in a bowl of something good. The service is fast and friendly. The food comes out minutes after you order it, and it's good if you're on a budget. Generous portions!  My recommendation:  Black garlic Kuro Ramen with egg, seaweed, and a side of kimchi (which is always fresh and flavorful)!  Ever since the first visit, the wait times have been constantly decreasing.   The proper method to eat at Monta Ramen is as follows:  Get in. Eat ramen. Leave. You'll love it.",

We ordered some gyoza, a tonkatsu ramen and a shoyu ramen with egg and kimchi and some cold green tea.  I loved that they offered kimchi as a side (I can't have ramen without it!) even though it was 'kimuchi' on the menu.  We tried to get the extra pork but they were out.  The gyoza was too greasy but tasted good.  The tonkatsu ramen was delish!  The broth was white, cloudy, flavorful and less greasy than the shoyu and the noodles were thinner.   The shoyu would be perfect for a  hangover.  The broth was darker, clearer, greasier, and saltier than the tonkatsu.  The ramens come with some green onions, and two pieces of tender pork.  The one thing that will keep me from going back is the temperature.  It is too hot in there, uncomfortably hot to really enjoy your meal especially if its a bowl of hot noodle soup.",

Definitely a busy place at around 7ish on a weekday night. Lucked out for a table as there are only 5/6 depending how they're arranged for size. Wood benches, chairs, stools, tables and wainscoting lined the restaurant.   There's also L shaped seating for around 10, bar style, around the kitchen area.  The restaurant later filled up with people waiting outside, so be prepared to wait during the typical eat times.  Menu was simple as there was only 3 types of ramen you could order, Miso, Shoyu, Tonkotsu and a couple of rice dishes.  Decided to try the shoyu ramen ($6.95) with toppings (ranges from $0.50 - $1.50) corn, kimchi, and Kaedama (extra noodles).  The broth was tasty and not too salty and the pork was flavourful with the melt in your mouth taste.  The corn was not too buttery but the kimchi could of been better. I was expecting more taste from the kimchi, as it was toned down from other Ramen places I've tried in the past as well as Korean restaurants. The extra noodles was served on the side and was fist sized.  Do this if you're extra hungry...I was comatose after finishing this.  The noodle was a little skinnier than expected but had the right consistency and texture. The gyoza was not too my liking (didnt finish) and I can live off dumplings! The exterior was grilled too long aka burnt and the 'insides' was semi cold like another yelper had mentioned....hmmmm...im guessing store bought?  I imagine them being frozen and put on the grill not long enough but on extra high heat!!! (I know this how??? I make them when I'm home...lol)  Yes, I'd come here again for a quick bowl of noodles but thats about it.",

For me it's small and for anyone that's used to eatting in Los Angeles Ramen houses its small.  I was not full at all from eatting here.  The price was ok.  I guess if you are in LV and want Ramen you don't have much choice.  If you ever go to Los Angeles, go to Little Tokyo Ramen houses!  It's A LOT better.  Honestly I couldn't believe this place was so packed.  Makes me want to move out here and start a Ramen place.",

The ramen sure taste good, but the only bad thing is that it's too salty for me. The place is really small so it's really packed when it's busy. I like how I get to see the kitchen when eating :]  I think this is the best ramen place in Vegas, and I will always come here to eat ramen, but it's not the best in U.S. (I like the one in little tokyo more)",

    "text": "We were tired of fine dining and buffets so we decided to head to Chinatown for Monta. They have a very simple menu with 3 types of ramen: shoyu, tonkotsu, miso (typical selection) ranging from $6.95-7.50. You also have the option of adding more noodles and toppings for $0.75 -$1.50. They also had gyoza, pork rice bowls, and fried rice. Service was nice and speedy. You can tell the girls here were used to dealing with the crowds.  We tried the tonkotsu ramen and the kim chi fried rice.  Overall the ramen was quite flavorful but the flavors don't compare to our favorite ramen place in San Diego at Izakaya Masa. Monta noodles are much thinner but not mushy or al dente (the way we like). It's served with a couple slice of pork, Asian mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. But I do like that they have pickled ginger and minced garlic jars out for self service.  The fried rice was decent but unremarkable.($6.95)  Overall, a good dining experience with reasonable prices. However, the restaurant is really small. There are only 5 small tables plus a L-shaped bar area for 8, so I would return only with small groups to avoid a long wait.",

The pork was ever so tender and if I knew the word for al dente in Japanese then I'd use it to describe their noodles! You will typically encounter a line as it is a small restaurant with only 5 tables and about 8 seats at their bar but well worth the wait! If you're thirsty for some Boba just go next door to Kung Fu while you wait! Enjoy everyone!",

So with that statement, it's the type of place you order--- eat--- and leave... You don't want to be the jerk holding up the wait :P   One thing that really caught my attention was how the chefs were dipping the bowl into hot boiling water before making your order to keep your food hot even longer.  I like to enjoy every bite of my food so by the end of my last bite my soup was still warm :P ( but I'll have to admit the last time I went they didn't dip my bowl )   I've tried all three fried rices on different occasions and all were good :) I think the kimchi is my favorite.  As for the  gyoza, it's pretty delicious and crispy.    I've tried all soups and I'll have to say I'll stick to the pork broth with thin noodles and of course adding some green onions and egg to that - call it my usual order :)",

The process is simple, order a base ramen (meat included) and then add desired toppings (minor extra charge). Then get ready to split those chopsticks, stir, and dig in. If you successfully eat all those tasty noodles too quickly, you can order more for $1.50. I had the Tonkotsu shoyu ramen, and I can happily say that the richness of the broth was very satisfying, the green onion topping cut through it very nicely, and I added nitamago because who doesn't like eggs? Can't wait to return and have more ramen!!!",

They put a lot of care into their food, which I under appreciated in my previous reviews. Yes, I still think service is sometimes a hit or miss, but lately its been great the past few times I've been here. Hopefully, this is just consistent and not my amazing luck. Also, they listened to their customers and opened up a new location in Henderson. I really appreciate restaurant owners who lend an ear to their customers and act accordingly.  Not much else to say about Monta, if you are looking for ramen in Las Vegas, you've come to the right place.",

The soup base if very thick and rich, very yummy, feels like a good stew from good pork. And the noodle is just right, not too soft and not too hard. Try eat noodle dipped in soup in one bite, it's heaven. :) I almost finished the whole bowl. The bowl is cheap like 6.95 - 8.95. You can add extra topping if you want. It only comes with chashu and a bit veggie for my meal but the good taste makes me happy enough. They don't have other sides or appetizers. As far as I remember, only gyozer and some fried rice. If I go LV later and want some Asian food, that'll probably be the first item popped into my mind.",

    "text": "This place looked promising, but didn't deliver.  I guess I was feeling patient and generous that day.  The wait was almost an hour long at lunch on Wednesday since the kitchen was larger than the dining room.  Once seated in one of the limited tables or bar seats, the food comes out pretty quickly to keep customers moving.  Most customers oblige by eating quickly and not loitering with conversation after their meals.  Price is also very good at about $7 per bowl.    I thought the tonkotsu soup base was decent, but temperature was only lukewarm.  It wasn't even hot enough to warm up the toppings in the soup.  When recapping what our favorite and least favorite meals we had this past weekend, both of them cited Monta as the least satisfying.  That's very telling because both of them typically like ramen and are not terribly hard graders.",

The broth within my Tonkotsu was insanely flavorful ---The limit does not exist for how much of this broth I would eat. The only disappointment was the egg which was rather bland, but the pork was tender and not dry or chewy. We ate here on a Saturday around 2pm and we had just a 10 minute wait, but the place is very small. Try to come during off hours.  The best part is that the bill was only $30 for 2 ramens, gyoza, and 2 beers.. far cheaper than we usually pay now that ramen is trendy!",

    "text": "QUICK & DIRTY: Before stuffing your face with silicone boobies and butts in Vegas, fuel-up with a bowl of deliciousness at Monta Ramen.  ***** My chubby, Filipino Uber driver -- transporting my friend and me from the airport to our hotel, -- tried selling us strippers to our room that night. So I decided to steer the conversation:  \"My man, where does an Asian homie like me get down with some ramen up in Vegas?\"   He replied, \"Oh, Monta Ramen, dog. That's the spot.\"   I yelped it, of course, and corroborated his recommendation with the four-star average and overall glowing reviews.  Things to know: *****  I. LOCATION & PARKING: This small restaurant resides in a strip mall off of Spring Mountain Road. It sits adjacent to Kung-Fu Tea and Big Wong. Could this shopping area be any more Asian? haha.   The lot doesn't have a lot of room, and parking will be harder than ascending to the top of rope at the end of just about every Ninja Warrior course.   God speed.  II. FOOD & DRINK: Their simplified menu ensures speedy service. They serve six different kinds of ramen (your base), and each added topping, of course, costs extra. They also offer a cold noodle dish, appetizers ranging from gyoza to three different kinds of fried rice, Ashai or Budweiser beer. They carry tea and Coke products, too.   I tasted their Kuro Ramen Black Garlic Oil, which is a garlic flavored pork broth with thin noodles ($6.95). For toppings, I ordered a soft boil egg ($1.50) and chasu ($2.50)  The savory broth had a nice depth to it. Not like other ramen places where it just tastes watered with salt. It also had enough garlic.   This bowl also comes with thin noodles, so they're not as bouncy or chewy as one might receive in a traditional tonkotsu. However, I still enjoyed eating them.  The slices of chashu pork melted in my mouth. I regret not getting another order.   The soft boiled egg came out with the soup cold, so I'm assuming they cook them beforehand and then refrigerate in order to save time. (Maybe?) I don't know. Maybe pouring a ladle or two of broth over the egg before bringing it out would've helped. Not a big deal, though.   III. SERVICE: They have an efficient setup, so the food came out fast. Also, the host and server treated me nicely. No problems there.  IV. AMBIENCE & DECOR: The small shop seems like it can only fit up to 30 people if that. I wouldn't recommend Manta, though, for groups. Rather, I'd recommend this place, for those wanting to eat solo or up to a couple other people AT MOST. I'd also recommend it to Uber drivers trying to hook up their passengers with strippers, too. Haha.  V. PRICES: Affordable, especially when considering the other food options in Vegas. I'd eat there weekly if I lived close by, honestly.   VI. OVERALL: Will this ramen blow your mind? I don't think so. But if you're looking to get your fix with a more than above average bowl in Vegas, Monta will likely deliver.",

I chose the spicy tonkotsu and gyoza. I loved the flavorful broth and the noodles were delicate and tasty. The gyoza was very delicious as well. It's obvious this place is popular when you arrive. The tiny inside is packed and there are people waiting outside. It looks like it only holds about 25 people. We were seated very quickly since we were only a party of 2 and there was room at the bar area. The food came out within minutes. One bowl and half of the gyoza is very filling. I left very satisfied and can't wait to try more.",

The noodles are cooked perfectly and all the flavors are on point. The restaurant is very small and crowded and there is usually a line of people for lunch and dinner. Best to go between 2pm-5pm if you don't want to wait. If you don't want to add extras the price is less than $7 before tax and tip. Food comes out fast. I wish they would upgrade their throw away chopsticks. They use the old school rectangular splintered kind you have to break apart.  Each broth is distinctively different. The pork belly is a little too fatty though. Only real appetizer you can get is gyoza. Wish they had small side dishes.",

My go to is the Tonkatsu ramen with thick wavy noodles and add egg, corn, Takana and I put their chili oil in it as well . Their gyoza is good too, but be prepared as it does take a bit for them to cook, so you end up eating ramen with the gyoza which isn't bad either.  Delicious ramen and great value!  I've had ramen from other places in town and other cities and I still always crave Monta!",

    "text": "Location:   This little \"Hole in the Wall Ramen\" gem is located in an older small shopping center off of Spring Mtn Rd, west of Decatur.It is  approximately 7-10 minutes from the Palazzo.   Ambiance:  It's a standard  28-30 person little Asian restaurant with bar and table seating. The lighting is good , not too bright, but dim enough to have a cozy like feel. The tables are good with soft cushions and the corner table has a wooden bench sitting area. This is a clean restaurant.  Customer Service:  Very fluent in English and they do allow modifications  with the food. They are very friendly and attentive.  Food & Beverages:  The water is very clean ,without any metallic or mineral flavor. It's obvious they have a higher quality water filter, which means they care about quality. They may not have the greatest selection of beverages,  but the food is where their mastery lies. The broth is rich and not salty whatsoever.  They provide numerous additional ingredients on the table to add to your food,including  a crushed garlic sauce that is ,in my opinion ,the perfect ingredient. They also have very well made kimchi.   Thee noodles actually taste exactly how ramen should taste. There are many varieties of ramen out there, but this type is what grandma makes. The fried  rice is amazing . They also have the kimchi fried rice(favorite mix-add garlic ,touch of vinegar, chili oil , and soy ),the standard and another type I am unsure of.   Negative:  It is the local's favorite and the place every foodie expert goes when they have their ramen crave...which means the wait maybe long if you come during prime time.** Advice: if you come in, in  pairs and are willing to sit in \"twos\" in different spots, you will get seated faster, just sign in under different names.",

    "text": "Before embarking on our long drive home today, my girlfriend and I wanted to grab lunch. We figured we'd just go to a usual spot and head home, but she discovered Monta on yelp while I was driving.  The wait was reasonable when we arrived. It gave us time to look over the menu and plan out our action plan for lunch!  I ordered their kuro black garlic oil ramen and my gf ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen. In addition we ordered their pork belly bowl and fried rice. Yes. It was a lot of food for just two people, but we were famished and both slightly hungover from the night before.   The food came out really fast and you can see it all being freshly prepared and made from the counter.  Pork belly bowl: The regular size is definitely a meal on its own. If you're looking to share, regular is perfect for two people. It was 4345873490% amazing!! The pork belly was incredibly tender and flavorful. The meat to rice ratio was perfect. The issue with pork belly bowls at a lot of ramen shops is that they're usually really bomb, but also really oily. Like, a small pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl oily. I was glad to discover that Monta doesn't run into this issue with their pork belly bowl!  Kuro black garlic ramen: I've always seen this style of ramen at a lot of different ramen places, but this was the first time I had it. It was a little on the oily side, but full of garlicky goodness. If you love garlic, this is the bowl for you.  Spicy tonkotsu: Basically tonkotsu broth with a spicy paste that you mix in. Great, tasty hearty broth with a kick.  Fried rice: The fried rice was so good too! Their fried rice was hearty with lots of ingredients with a hint of wok-hei. Wok-hei is a subtle flavor that fried rice takes up when being cooked in a searing hot wok.  The portions here for the rice bowls are meals on their own, so if you plan on eating ramen, I'd recommend sizing down to a small unless you're sharing.  However, the ramen bowls aren't as large. It's perfect for an individual though, so you will definitely feel satisfied afterwards.  I'm really glad we avoided going to a usual spot and trying something new before we hit the road. We ate around 1 and finally got home not too long ago and I'm still feeling a bit full from lunch. I've got some rice leftover from lunch that I'm really looking forward to eating later!",

Waiting time varies from 10-40 minutes, maybe even longer depending on the time you go and the size of your party.    Try to get here before noon and late evening. Those are the times when the restaurant and parking lot will be PACKED.   In terms of their food, the ramen is amazing! The meat is SUPER tender. I highly recommend the Tonkotsu, which is their #1 ramen. The broth is REALLY creamy. I also recommend the Miso. If you're a sweet tooth, this is definitely the ramen to get. The broth has a little sweetness to it.",

Two irritably famished people who are ready to strangle each other in about 2.5 seconds and almost ready to just head to In-N-Out because everything else was closed. Enter Monta.   We were initially going to try and eat at JINYA ramen, but the wait time was one hour too short of us starving to death. By some miracle, we found ONE spot open in the parking lot and also ONE table that happened to be available right at the moment. Thank you baby jeezus!!   The co-habby devoured his Pork Belly bowl which was tender and full of flavor. I had the Kuro Ramen - Black Garlic Oil which featured Pork broth, roasted garlic flavor, thin noodles. This was damn tasty although the broth was a bit chalky for me. Still a bigger fan of the Raki Raki black garlic ramen however this was quite good. It's also only $7.95 but if you want a Nitamago egg, it's an extra $1.50. A bit skimpy on the pork too.  Service was friendly and lightning fast, which we appreciated since we were exhausted and just wanted to get some sleep after our long drive from SD. It's not a fancy place by any means and very tiny, but it's authentic and a great little hole in the wall in LV's Chinatown when you want a satisfying bowl of ramen or other Japanese fare. Will return!",

The food came out quickly, which made up for the long wait outside. My Miso Ramen tasted off because of the miso. When I tasted my buddy's Tonkotsu, it was much better. The egg was nothing to write home about, but the noodles were pretty good.   On the other hand, the Gyoza and Pork Belly Bowl were good as well as the service. Overall, pretty good. Just not sure I'd wait about 1.5 hours for it though if I had a choice.",

I got the Kuro Ramen Black Garlic Oil. The broth was rich but not too salty; the favors from the black garlic oil were wonderful. They had thin noodles, very standard. It was very oily, but that was expected for tonkotsu ramen. Their ramen bowls were cheap (~$7-$8), and it came with 2 pieces of chashu, bamboo shoots, and wood ear mushroom. I had to order the nitamago separately, and it was okay. I personally thought the chashu was too fatty, but I still liked the ramen overall.  Definitely a good option if you are craving some comforting rich ramen, but do expect to wait a bit. Boba and dessert places are conveniently located in the same plaza if you have room for that afterward!",

To me, the core of a restaurant is the food, and if it is exceptional, I am willing to deal with some inconveniences to enjoy that food. Monta Ramen is one of those places. Their food is exceptional. Monta Ramen is not a place you go hang out, is not a place for a date, is not a place to have a nice dinner out. Monta Ramen is a place to go eat, period. It is a place for people in the search for outstanding food. You go there to eat, then you eat, then you leave, no frills.  Everything you order is outstanding, but the garlic broth is my favorite, their broth is so concentrated in pork flavor is thick. Almost gelatinous. Just heaven. Order the fried rice, it is perfectly cooked, perfectly season, fluffy and sticky at the same time.  Monta Ramen runs as a perfectly oiled machine, whose main purpose is to feed delicious food to as many people as possible. Hence, you will wait a long time to be seated, after you get seated you will be served quickly and expected to leave quickly. If you are into really good food go here if you are into having an experience first, then eat, don't go here. This restaurant is for food lovers, not experience seekers.",

I understand the restaurant itself is small and can get crowded pretty quickly, however, whenever I am sat down by my server (no matter who it is, I have come plenty of different times throughout the years) I feel like I'm being rushed through the whole service. They come to your table about 3 minutes after sitting you down and asking your drink order and make it almost painfully obvious they want you to order right at that moment so they can rush to get your order out. It's extremely rushed and makes me feel less valued as a customer and more as a dollar sign. As of now this is ok with me but I will definitely consider switching to another ramen spot if this goes on and I consistently feel rushed as a customer.",

We were lucky and fitted right away, we came around 430 p.m. Monta is another very quaint ramen joint that greets you when you arrive, and quickly serves their specialties. Their ramen options are well described and actually convinced me to try a broth I never had. Delicious!!! Though I am a huge pork fan and the broth made with pork is divine.  They don't have ramen that is specifically spicy, but they have a spicy option. They offer many sides for a nominal fee, including extras that were pretty tasty. The kimchi fried rice was very good, but the pork belly bowl was lacking meat...  The green onions are shredded, I wasn't a fan as it lost its flavor being so thin. Though I was very pleased with the creamy consistency of my soup. I enjoyed my lunch and the employees were very delightful. But, I would rate Monta on Spring Mountain 3***'s",

Seating is very limited so at times you have to wait 15-30mins for a table but it's sooooo worth it!  Their ramen bowls are full of flavor and the noodles are tender. Their gyozas are one of my favorites the only thing is that they don't have gyoza sauce for it so you have to 'make your own' using the different sauces on the table. (mine always come out different everytime :-/ ) Love their pork fried rice too! I can eat that rice everyday!",

    "text": "2.5** Good news first :) Yes the wait is long cuz the entire plaza where this is located is full of seemingly awesome restaurants. There's a sign in sheet to help keep orderly and seems to be the practice in Chinatown restaurants. The parking lot is packed during dinner time. People were walking in from parking across the street. But hooray for the selections of neighboring restaurants!  Yes service is quick and attentive. They clean off tables and seating areas as soon as guests are through. We got bar seats facing the kitchen and were able to watch their process. They wear gloves and hair bandanas. Saw how they keep their soup bowls hot. Saw how routine it was to put noodles, ingredients, and broth. Saw how busy the workers were. Our orders came out quickly after ordering.  Yes their ramen soup is totally delish! Hot, tasty, comfy, and a good amount of ingredients. Their awards and acknowledgments on the walls live up to the best value. Absolutely enjoyed the flavor! There was enough in our bowls for another soupy meal for later. Wish I could've finished it cuz I was having a needy moment. The rest of the soup to go - so it is so...  No there is not a lot of room for a popular place to eat. After a tiny bit of parking frustration, then there's the seating wait, and the standing, and the crowd. I wish they had better space; and perhaps that is what's in plans for such a successful place. Real awesome for them! Good luck on the bigger space.  No 3 whole stars or 3.5 - what's up Jo... Why're you jippin' on the stars?! Oh no see... Was looking forward to leftover soup for lunch the next day. Saddened me to gags that the broth was hard like butter! Eeeuuuw what! That doesn't happen to pho noodle broth! What was REALLY in this ramen broth?!?!?! (Grumpy cat face) I think I'll pass on next time.",

They also let us look at the menu and order while we were waiting so we could get our ramen soon after we got seated.   My personal favorite was the Tonkatsu Shoyu ramen, I've never had them mixed together and who knew they would be such a good combo! The Tonkatsu gave the broth the fatty rich taste, and the shoyu gave it a bit more kick in the flavor. For the marinated half-boiled egg (Ntamago), you have to order on the side, which is super worth it if you like them! The chashu was fatty and went well with the ramen.   Portion was okay, some of the guys in the group did wish they order extra noodle though. Overall a great ramen place, will be back again!",

There are actually a few other asian things in this plaza.  I was happy we found this spot.  It's a legit Japanese Ramen place, we tried the Kuru ramen which was black and garlicy. I thought it was good, not amazing, but something different.  You don't get to select how firm you want your noodles, I felt they were on the firm side so if you like that.  Price is good, I think about $6.75 for a bowl of ramen and you can get refills on noodles if you wish.  You can also add additional toppings like egg, etc.    What was a must-do was getting a side of the pork belly bowl.  Think of it as an upgraded Yoshinoya beef bowl.  Instead, it's pork belly, the taste is strong juicy.  It is a little much to get ramen and a small side of pork belly bowl but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I want to come back and try fried rice with my ramen but I don't know if i'll be able to not get the pork belly again.  I would try a different ramen next time to see how they do on the traditional items.  Solid place for authentic Japanese Ramen and Sides.",

All add the add ons are very cheap as well.   I have also tried the gyoza and kimchi fried rice. Both very good, although I would prefer if they chopped the onions a tad bit smaller but I'm not complaining too much about it.   Although this location is very small and very busy they really know how to turn over the tables fast and I love it!",

As for the atmosphere, the wait is INSANE. Fortunately we didn't have to wait too long because we went at a slow time. However, usually the wait can be hours. They have one small bar, and then a couple tables.  There is a long waiting list for dine in. Their prices are amazing, especially compared to Reno ramen prices. I ordered the spicy ramen for $7, and the pork belly bowl for $4. The ramen was amazing and tasty; toppings are extra, but even without toppings they are delicious. The pork belly bowl was to die for; it was so tasty and filling. I was very satisfied by the taste and flavor of the dishes. For great pricing and authentic taste, this place is worth the wait. But the downside is the wait. I would not recommend this place for people who want a quick bite.",

    "text": "I know this is a violation of Yelp Law, but my visit to Monta was only the second time in my life that I've had ramen (Cup O'Noodles doesn't count, not that I eat it).    I may have been spoiled by the first time, which was in New Jersey.  At that place I was able to customize it to the skies: choice of the regular pork broth, or chicken, or even vegetable.  Too salty?  \"No prob, we can do low sodium.\" And I was able to have chicken or shrimp (can't remember which) instead of some fatty pork.  It wasn't that way at Monta.  What you see is what you get, complete with photos.  And since even as a kid I was nauseated by even the tiniest bit of fat on any meat or poultry, I couldn't stand the pork that was in the bowl and had to remove it.  I'll take a nice, lean piece of pork loin any time, but not the stuff that makes up the choices at Monta.  The broth was pretty decent, and I'm a sucker for noodles of any kind, but the ramen here will never be my comfort food.  While service was quick, the tiny and cramped space does not lend itself to comfort or relaxation, so fast service was definitely welcome.    I don't disagree with all of those who love this place.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess.",

    "text": "I'll make this short and sweet. Hey, that's the perfect description of our waitress!  We arrived on Friday night, between 6-7PM to a full parking lot, but a slow night over at Monta Ramen. We found street parking, got our name on the list and probably sat around 7 minutes after that. The bar top was packed while the main area had a steady flow of patrons ordering, dining, enjoying then leaving. Seems like standard operating procedures, so let's do it.  I ordered the Spicy Tonkutsu Ramen and our table shared the Takana Rice. Literally, our ramen showed up within minutes.. Seems like they might have it sitting stove top somewhere. It took longer for our rice to show up, but it was definitely worth it. The rice was tasty, as are most fried foods. Fluffy and moist with bits and pieces of meat, egg and dashes of spice.   As far as the ramen goes, there was a taste I can't quite describe.. it wasn't necessarily bad nor was it good. What saved the bowl, in my opinion, was the fact that they include a little sriracha style chili sauce which blended well in the broth and masked that indescribable taste. That, along with garlic and a dab of soy totally turned this dish from a 3 to a 4. The spice level, out of 10, had to be in the 5 or 6 zone. ALMOST had me, but it was more of a flavor than the actual kick. The ramen noodles were a little thin making it truly easy to finish this bowl off, which I find hard to do in the SGV area due to the portion sizes.  This wasn't necessarily the best ramen I've had to date, but having the wind gust hard outside along with winter like temps and an empty stomach, it definitely did the job.. We didn't have to wait in a dreaded line, super-friendly service, decent prices, prompt ticket turnaround times and the meal was quite fulfilling.",

I love the open kitchen layout because it's fun to see the cooks at work making the food and creating the magic.  So let me back up. This little restaurant is located in a small strip mall off of Spring Mountain (Las Vegas' International District). Use Yelp Directions to help you find it. It's small, clean, and similar to a place you might visit in Tokoyo today (only it's missing the plastic food display at the front of the store). We walked in around 4'ish and the place was already packed.  Luckily, we only had to wait a couple of minutes before a place opened up at the bar.  A very nice server came over and took our orders down on her iPad (good modern touch).    The Shoyu Ramen (thick ramen, soy sauce & chicken broth w/ 2 slices of Pork) was only $6.95;  Tonkatsu (thin ramen, pork bone stew w/ 2 slices of Pork and a side of spicy sauce was $7.95; side of Kimchi $1; and rice $1. Oolong tea served nice and hot in a can was only $1.75.    Any Cons, you may ask? Well the restaurant is really small and really crowded because of it's popularity & tasty Ramen.  You have to eat fast or your Ramen will get cold. Also they want you out of there as quick as possible so they can make room for the poor customers waiting in line.  Think of this as an Express Ramen Noodle shop. We enjoyed this experience and definitely plan to visit again soon.",

Came here because a few friends raved about it and it looked like it had amazing reviews, came half an hour before opening time just to make sure we wouldn't have to wait too long. luckily my group of about 20 just barely fit behind a few other couples. very small place that seats less than 30?  The ramen wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't all that great. I'm from LA so I guess I probably am lucky to have much more options but you would figure Vegas has the best of all worlds. Compare to anything else I've ever had around LA, this was much more salty, portions were a tad bit smaller, other than the saltiness not that flavorful. Menu here is small but some Japanese restaurants tend to be so that wasn't too big of a surprise.  You definitely have to be a pork lover because that's pretty much all they have, if I remember right they have approximately four different ramen choices, and a few other side dishes like fried rice and gyoza.  If you are a local I'm sure this may be as good as it gets? But if you're from out of town only try this place if there is no wait. Totally not worth a wait.",

    "text": "Wow, this place is really good, and probably the most inexpensive ramen place I've been to.  I think the bowl of ramen I had was around $7, versus the $9 I spend at other joints.  But do not be deceived by the price, the noodles are good, and so is the broth.    After reading all the reviews we got here before it opened.  Since there was already a couple sitting on the bench, I decided to stand by the pillar near the door.  Within 10 minutes, a crowd began to form and they created their own impromptu line...which I was late to realize.  Still, I decided it would be ridiculous for me to get to the back of the line, which was beyond the front of the restaurant at that point, and so I stuck it out, and just got in line once the doors opened behind the first couple figuring those who came later had to have seen me standing there.  Luckily all went smoothly without any incident.  Food came out quickly, and service was good.  For big eaters, the offer extra noodles for a little more than a buck.  Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals.      With that said, my tip to you is that if you get there before the door opens, beware of the line that quickly forms, as I noticed that I would not have been able to get a seat, had I decided to conform to what everyone else decided to do.  Still I can't fault them for creating a line, as there were truly a lot of people that got there seemingly at the same time, and still more getting there as the restaurant finally opened.",

The lines - The place is typical for a Ramen shop, with limited space to eat and to wait, but it is worth it.  My suggestion is to go when it opens and it will be all good.  2.  The food -  Have had: a.  Miso Ramen - Bean Paste Ramen, very tasty. noodles perfect. b.  Shoyu Ramen - Soy Sauce flavored broth and a nice stand by. c.  Tonkatsu Ramen - Pork Bone broth - my favorite.  All noodles are just right, al dente and the broth is not piping hot as I would expect, but tasty overall.  Perhaps they believe the western palate does not prefer the hot broth, but to me, it has to be piping hot to be perfect.  The soups have a perfect blend of roasted pork slices that are tender and tasty.  3.  Price - Very reasonable, approximately 7.00 depending if you put extra stuff in the noodles.  Check this place out.  you will not be disappointed.",

A thick hearty, flavorful broth with thick ramen noodles, and extra toppings (whichever are your favorite) and the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen really hits the spot. Next time I will try the black garlic broth, it looks so interesting! The service is very friendly and attentive. This is definitely the best ramen I've had in Vegas!",

    "text": "Monta Ramen is a combination of things that works out just right to get 5 stars. I'll start with the little frustrations to get them out of the way.      The parking lot for the group of shops it's in is woefully undersized. You may have a hard time finding a spot right there. Next, there may be a bit of a wait. We went on a Monday with maybe a 20 minute wait, but I've heard from others it can get to be pretty long. Well... That's about it.      So the menu is small, but has the essentials. For three of us, we decided to have ramen, then split some extras. The pork belly rice bowl was great as were the gyoza. Everything we ordered was simple, but tasted great.      The ramen came out for the next part of the meal. We all went with the tonkotsu ramen. Limited add-ones included, but it wasn't lacking. The broth was amazingly creamy/milky and rich. The noodles had a great texture. Insanely hot, so many sure not to burn your mouth! I made sure to keep plenty of broth left for kaedama (extra serving of noodles).      Prices were super-affordable. If you stick with just ramen it's a steal. Even with extras you won't break the bank.",

We ordered the braised pork with egg on rice and two bowls of pork ramen.  We added an egg and extra meat to the ramen.  It was actually too much meat and we didn't finish it.  The broth was a little on the rich and oily side.  We thought they added butter to the broth but we asked the server and she said no butter.  It was still delicious and we would go again just not during peak hours.",

Living in Honolulu, we have really good Ramen restaurants here and after visiting New York City last year, my Ramen standards are a lot higher and whenever I'm in another city I always make it a point to have my Ramen fix. Last March I visited Ramen Sora and it was good but I think Ramen Monta beats it by far!  After a day of shopping at all the trader Joe's with my girlfriend Mochi we decided to have lunch at Ramen Monta because she knew how much I love my Ramen and it was a bit cold that day. The wait wasn't quit as long as she thought it would be because we beat the lunchtime rush so we were seated within a few minutes.   I got their new spicy Ramen and my girlfriend ordered the regular tonkatsu Ramen, we also ordered a side of the menchenko eggs with rice. The quality of noodle is good, very thin and soft and the broth is like buttery, not to salty, not to oily and so smooth and soothing. I think the broth is what makes a good quality Ramen. The price is also just right because for all 3 items I paid about $20 not including tip. Workers are very sweet and the food comes out quick...Be sure to go early because as we were eating and it got more towards lunch time, the line started forming.  I was raving about this place so much to my boyfriend who didn't come with us because he was sleeping back in the hotel room, so suxx for him. I will be sure to hit this place back up on the next Vegas trip.",

We went with the Yelp highlights, and I'd hate to mention these here again since I don't think the system Yelp is built on filters out the negative comments for items mentioned a lot and it just keeps reinforcing the highlights even though I don't like em!  Tonkotsu Ramen - Got this and asked for extra spicy sauce since I didn't see the Spicy Tonkotsu on the chalkboard right away. It was good, but honestly way TOoOoOOo salty. I didn't realize it at first cause I was so hungry, but honestly it was very salty and I couldn't finish the soup  Gyoza - Nothing special whatsoever and no special sauces for this Kimchi Fried Rice - does NOT taste like a kimchi fried rice you'd expect after living in K town for some time Pork Belly Bowl - Also a MEH for me. I can see how it is taste so if you're into the crispy 'chadol'/yoshinoya type of meat then you should try this. A little saucey which ain't necessarily a bad thing. I also took this one home and ate it the next day and I didn't hate it.  Overall, unfortunately for the amount of reviews this place has, it was only worth 3 stars for me. I can confidently say I am a strong foodie and have my spots in the different cities I frequent and I was hoping to find a go-to ramen spot in Vegas. With that said, unfortunately I do not think it will be Monta.  I might come back for Kung Fu next door and if my ramen craving kicks, I might give it another go.",

Their Tonkatsu Ramen is absolutely incredible with regards to the depth of flavor and the value. Their ingredients taste fresh and appear to be well handled.

    "text": "**3.5 Stars**  Located conveniently next to Raku on the outskirts of Las Vegas Chinatown, Monta is the latest darling in the Vegas foodie scene and follows the popular ramen trend that has already hit LA, NYC, and the Bay Area.    Authentically Japanese owned and frequented by many Japanese during our visit, Monta offers shoyu, tonkotsu, and miso broths.  Tonkotsu appears to be their most popular offering and bowls start at a reasonable $6.95.  Each bowl comes with two pieces of chashu, green onions, and some bamboo shoots.    Overall, the bowls are on the small side and toppings a bit sparse than other top places I've frequented.  Corn, butter, Kim Chee, and a hard boiled, not soft boiled, egg can be added.    Broth flavor was good though a tad salty and one noted compared to the more complex broths I love at Santouka.   The noodles are fresh but thin reminding me of the fresh made noodles at Maru Ichi in the Bay Area. I personally like thicker noodles like Orenchi in Sunnyvale.  Service, due to the small space and crowds, can feel a bit rushed and they initially forgot our drink orders.  No biggie and quickly fixed.    Monta is a nice addition to the ramen scene but with minimally topped bowls and solid broths, ramen aficionados will likely have tried more polished ramen parlors in SoCal and NorCal.    Monta doesn't accept credit cards and is cash only.",

SInce japan, if i see ramen ill get it, only to relive that trip.  Monta, i probably the closest to authentic ramen that i've had outside of japan. Their broth is rich and has the body that a good tonkotsu broth is suppose to. The chashu is very tender and soft, but still holds its shape and doesnt fall apart. Monta just has everything spot on.  This is a definite visit when i visit Las Vegas again 5 stars!",

It is filled with yummy things like cucumbers, eggs, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts \"mushroom/fungi\" and of course the fatty pork. Since I tried it a couple of weeks ago, I haven't strayed from the cold to the hot. The mustard is a bit spicy for my taste so I always have them leave it off.  I've only tried the sesame sauce thus far, but I am pretty content with it. For the price you pay, you definitely get your money's worth. I've always had to take half of it home to eat it for later which works out for me since I love leftovers!   I also ordered the small pork belly bowl.... that sauce with rice is heaven! I love Monta and I love how efficient and fast the food comes out. If you are coming for lunch, it's packed at 11:30 when they first open, so come later if you can.",

    "text": "Got here a little before opening and already a line had formed (at least 15 people deep).  Pretty cramped inside, with about 6-7 tables and counter seating for 10.  Food took a while to come out, and a big reason why was there was only one person cooking the noodles, prepping the bowls, and plating/garnishing (with one person taking care of the rice items).  The waitstaff would just stand and wait for the food to be ready.  It could have been more efficient (and thus quicker), but maybe they were limited by the size of the kitchen.  Oh well...  The ramen itself was just okay, with average-tasting broth and average noodles.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with the wavy noodles, and some pork belly bowls and fried rice for the kids.  Not bad overall, and service was good, but I prefer Fukumimi Ramen to this place.  But mad props to that multi-tasking cook, he sure was fun to watch!",

    "text": "A wonderfully delicious place to have a hot steaming bowl of ramen!!  I usually order the miso or tonkatsu ramen.... until I decided to order the \"cold\" ramen noodles on an extremely hot & sunny day.  The cold noodles have been the only disappointment I've experienced at Monta. Even my sister, who lived in Japan for 3 years, said the cold noodles were different from what she's had before.  However, she did say Monta was just like the traditional noodle houses in Japan!  I agree with some reviewers.... at times, the broth has been on the saltier side. But that hasn't stopped me from returning on a regular basis.  Monta is an excellent place to have a bowl of ramen and if you're really hungry, get a small side of the pork belly bowl, too. You won't be disappointed! Although a very small restaurant, the service has always been good and the dishes come out very quickly.",

    "text": "Monta, according to one of my friends who lived in Japan, is as close to authentic Japanese ramen as you can get in Las Vegas. I'll take his word for it.  The small ramen joint does not fit many and there is often a wait. Your entire group has to be there in order to be seated as well. There is a $10 minimum for card.  The waitresses are obviously experienced and seemlessly work together and with the chefs to efficiently serve customers. They are friendly, but not overly so. Food comes quickly as well because their menu is pretty small.  My usual order is a miso ramen with corn. The main reason I get corn is because the broth is a little too salty. Many people complain about this but I never really felt the extent of Monta's salty broth until the past year or so. It just seems thicker and more unhealthy than it used to be. I'm not sure if their recipes changed or if my tastes changed.  You get nori, chashu, and bamboo. Condiments you can add include garlic puree, pickled ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and chili powder. One thing that used to bother me when I first started coming here was that they only have green tea iced and in a can.   They also have a few other dishes besides the various ramen, including rice bowls, friend rice, cold noodles, and gyoza. For recent additions to the menu, they have the option to make your noodles spicy (+$1) or the kuro ramen, which is black garlic ramen. It's actually pretty tasty in my opinion, but I am an avid eater of garlic.  Regardless of the heavy mouthfeel of the ramen, the consistent service and food keeps regulars like me coming back.",

I have had to drive out to Monta Chaya out in Henderson a couple times because their place is bigger and I don't have to wait as long.  I usually have their Shoyu Ramen with an extra serving of noodles. Their fried rice and gyozu is what I will sometimes order and both are excellent. The staff is friendly and courteous, but very busy. Their prices are pretty reasonable.

Seems like as it's gotten more crowded, the food quality and service has gone downhill.  I've had the ramen, fried rice, and pork belly bowl here and nearly any choice you get is pretty decent. Sometimes you may get a bowl of ramen that's a little saltier than others...I'm sure this is directly related to how busy they've gotten.

If you think you're going to be clever by getting there right when they open for lunch, you really need to get there right when they open, not 10 minutes after they open!  We arrived at 11:32am on a Saturday as a party of 5 and were the first guests and thought \"Hey, that was easy! Maybe this place doesn't get that busy for Saturday lunch?\"  Suddenly, over the next 5 minutes, several other parties of 2 or 3 people came in one right after another and the place was suddenly full!  If you arrived at 11:40am, you were then looking at a wait of 30-45 minutes until the initial parties were served, ate and left.  So go early!  The ramen was good.  I do wish they would give you more than 2 thin slices of roasted pork.  I don't know that I'd go again if the wait was over 15 minutes though.  (I actually really like the ramen at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's where you can request all you want roasted pork (since it's a buffet!).  The slow cooked broth there is unexpectedly and surprisingly really good too.)",

Miso Ramen 7.25  Pork Broth w/thin noodles (you can choose between chicken or pork broth, thin or wide noodles)   Special toppings for your Ramen: Chasu Pork $2.50 Spicy $1.50 Shreeded Green Onion $1.50 Seasoned hard boiled egg $1.50 Takana Mustard Leaf  $1.50 Corn .50  Other:  Gyoza $5.50  So this place is off the strip, you would need to take a cab here.  It is located in the Chinatown area of Vegas.  We waited for about 45mins, got seated and went straight into ordering our meal.  The service was fast.  Ingredients on the ramen are placed on top, but before I mixed everything altogether I tried the broth and it was very good.   Adding the ingredients of the spicy sauce, Mustard Leaf and Chasu in Pork broth made the soup just way too salty for me to eat it.  I really wish the server would had informed me that this would have happened.  Otherwise, the Chasu was really tender and the thin noodles were not too overwhelming.  Everything in the bowl was well portioned. Then I had the gyoza, it just tasted like any frozen gyoza purchased at a super market.  Overall, I would come back here and not make the same mistake by ordering too many salty add ons in my ramen.",

With that being said I was very disappointed to find out that they added a 20% tip on to my check and that I paid without knowing. I was not given the option to tip instead it was just given to me as a part of my bill. I found this out when I was going through my checking account. Very dishearting guys. The concept of a tip is optional it is NOT mandatory. Overall food was good but they have some shady business practice.",

My shoyu ramen was only a slight step above your run of the mill Sapporo Ichiban packaged ramen, with a less than spectacular chasshu. The tonkotsu was a bit more flavorful, but both broths were left unfinished by me and my friend.   I hope to try Sora Ramen (Sapporo style ramen) down the street from Monta, and another joint close by. We were drawn in by the good reviews, but left with our own less than glowing opinion of those reviews.",

I don't know if they make fresh noodles here but I know I've had better noodles.  However that soft cooked tea egg, PERFECTION.  That really made my ramen so much better.

I've heard only amazing things about Monta Ramen from fellow online Yelpers. But lemme tell ya, I should have listened to my actual Yelp foodie friends from the Bay Area. They told me, \"Monta ain't all that.\"   Don't get me wrong, service was pretty good actually. Maybe too good...cuz my ramen came out within minutes of ordering. How is that even possible? Do they have it pre-made in the back and it's just microwaved or something?  I had very high hopes for Monta, sadly...I will never return. Here are my reasons:  1. TOO SALTY. And even if you ask for less salty...you're still gonna feel bloated as shizz from the sodium.  2. Noodles are NO BUENO. They're like thin vermicelli noodles. I like my ramen noodles thick and with the right kinda chew!  3. My soft boiled egg got cold within minutes. Hmmmm :-|  4. Spicy means weaksauce-American-spicy to them.  5. Oh yes, and there's always a wait here too. Why, I have no clue...  Do yourself a favor. Go across the street to Ramen Sora and have a real bowl of delicious ramen.   You can tell I was quite excited to sit down and enjoy my meal when I first got to Monta...check out my YouTube vlog for that weekend: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDhN4ggfu52w%26list%3DUU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA&s=4678a75e88a62a4b483b71d53305f017694ed09d4503f76c47c83d6521eb3335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=DhN4...</a>",

Whenever a new ramen spot pops up in town, you can count on me to be there to slurp and sample the goods. Nothing, I repeat, nothing... compares to the depth of flavor and texture of the ramen at Monta. Their pork chasu is succulent and flavorful. I consistently order miso ramen with extra pork chasu, corn and nori (seaweed). Along with my ramen is a regular sized order of pork chasu fried rice. I've had their gyoza as well and am always satisfied with the taste and crunch of the wonton. I've never felt like anything was overly dry or extremely fattening, while eating. I hate going to places where the pork chasu is dry. I absolutely can't stand it. This visit around, my brother placed an order for a small pork chasu bowl and rice. I've never tried that before and it was tasty. BUT I will definitely be sticking to my one True love, miso ramen! Mind you, here we are in the dead heat of summer (112-117 degree Fahrenheit) eating soup.",

I always ordered Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen with Thick Wavy Noodle since 2012. I know how that broth tastes like with my eyes closed, and tonight I was disappointed. I ordered my usual that I've been eating for about 6 years now, and it tasted different.  I told the waitress about it, and she insisted that it was Tonkatsu Shoyu. I told her that it wasnt what I'm used to, and I guess the waitress, Brenda, was offended. She argued and was rude, she stopped by at our table several times insisting what I received was Tonkatsu Shoyu, and she argued I was wrong. Long story short, the second bowl I received also tasted different. So I guess they changed the way they make their Tonkatsu Shoyu or changed chef or something. It was not the Monta I was used to. The environment was hostile, waitress was rude, and what made the restaurant worth it did not taste good anymore. What a loss. I loved Monta.",

Plan to wait outside bc there is not enough seating in the inside to wait. Parking Can be tough. Wish they would open a bigger place. You are crammed in like sardenes. Menu is pretty basic.

Food that will blow your mind! The food is mind-numbingly fantastic. The noodles in all the ramen dishes are perfectly cooked along some of the most divine broths I've ever tasted.  They have $1.00 a la carte menu items as well. The presentation of these divine bowls of heaven are wonderful and the tastiest out there! I must recommend a splash of their black garlic oil in your bowl of noodles. Kimchi is fantastic as well. Will definitely be visiting again...and again and again.",

    "text": "Monta Ramen is a popular spot located in Chinatown. Their place isn't big at all, and this place can probably only seat around 25 people. I had to wait around 15 minutes for enough people to leave to seat four at the bar. If you have a party of more than four, you will definitely have to wait longer since there's only two tables that can seat that much.  First of all, I have to say I'm astonished by their prices. I'm typically used to $12+ bowls of ramen, and these were all around $7! I ordered the tonkotsu ramen, which has a creamy, pork broth. The other two popular bowls are the tonkotsu/shoyu and the spicy tonkotsu ramen. All bowls come with the basic green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. Toppings are available for pretty cheap as well. I added an egg for $1.50.   Being seated at the bar let us watch what happened. The kitchen works super fast, and we all had our bowls within seven minutes. We ordered a gyoza appetizer, but it came out five minutes after our speedy ramen. For the price, the portion size was large and kept me full. The noodles were perfectly cooked and on the chewier side, which I liked. The noodles make up the majority of the bowl, but the toppings are a little lacking. The egg I ordered was cold. I would've liked it better if basic toppings included more vegetables. The broth was the perfect consistency, but it was too salty for me to enjoy. My mom and brother ordered extra noodles for $1.50, and they came out in two minutes. The extra noodles is literally the same amount as what you get in the beginning. It's a huge amount of food for such a small price!   The gyoza was a little overcooked and the bottom was slightly burnt. The filling lacked flavor and I wouldn't recommend it.  Definitely would recommend coming here for the ramen bowls! Their price is unbeatable.",

Vegas was raining so we were craving some ramen :) The service is quick and they are consistent!! Ate here 4 years ago & it was just as good. The prices are definitely fair and they don't skimp on serving sizes. Very straightforward menu, so if this is your first time, have a look while you're waiting.  Ordered the Tonkatsu. The pork belly is always tender and I love adding the red powder stuff (not entirely sure what it is, but it's great) thin noodles make it easier to devour quicker. The broth can be a bit on the greasier side, but that's just personal preference. Can't wait to try other menu items!!   ***$10 MINIMUM TO USE CARD",

The portions are smaller, but just order extra noodles for 1.50 and reuse the soup you never finish anyway.  I took mine home and had it for lunch the next day. Two very tasty meals for about 11 bucks after it is all said and done. Service is friendly, although they do get pretty busy.   I'm not super picky about attentive service, and not shy about just calling someone over or walking up to the register to get done what needs to get done. They do a great job here and I wouldn't have it any other way. Especially for the price.  The ramen price is a much better deal than their fried rice dishes.",

Pro-tip: sit at the bar and watch the chef bust out a ton of bowls of ramen. I ordered Tonkatsu ramen with an egg and butter. It was so deliciously thick and creamy with a nice porky flavor. The pork itself was flavorful and delicious. We also got gyoza which was made to order and small plates of fried rice.",

We finally made the time to stop in and see what all the talk was about. Like any ramen place, it's small and tight. Not recommended for big parties and families due to the space though (mainly those with babies and infants). We were seated right away which surprised us because everyone mentioned a wait. But since there was just two of us we didn't mind sitting at the bar. Right when we sat down people started pouring in. There was literally always a party waiting. The service was quick, like most ramen places. When our ramen came out we were so hungry I was surprised I took a photo. They have one size, which comes with a lot and of course you can add extra toppings for a fee. We loved their ramen. The noodles here were thinner than most ramen places but still so delicious. The 'spicy' wasn't so spicy.. but there's really only one ramen place we've been to where to spicy was actually spicy. I recommend ramen lovers to definitely try this place out. It did not disappoint.",

Presentation of ramen looks simple, but once you consume noodles, broth and toppings, all the flavors integrate and mesh nicely together.    My sister ordered Shoyu Ramen with corn since this is her favorite.  She said, \"You have to try it!\"  I'm one that can go without shoyu in my ramen.  One bite and I was very impressed with how well restaurant staff prepared and made this entree.  I fell in love with shoyu all over again.   I wanted to feast on an extraordinary entree and Kuro Ramen - Black Garlic Oil grabbed my attention.  This dish satisfied my palate 100%.  I'm amazed at how both dishes were light tasting and very delicious.   People will literally sign in and wait for their turn to dine here.  Customers will keep coming back for more.  That's what makes this place awesome!",

Service is nice, place is as clean as it could get. I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen without black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and green onions, (basically just leave me with soup, noodles, and 2 slabs of meat). I don't want to waste ingredients so don't give it to me, save it for the next person haha.  Ramen took about 10 minutes and it's a pretty big bowl. I really liked the broth. It was thick and full of flavor. The meat was marinated well with not a lot of fat. The noodles were cooked well. Definitely will come back here for ramen if I'm ever in Vegas.",

Full of flavor too! Also delicious!   Gyoza- not recommended. Soggy. Didn't seem cooked all the way. Waitress said it'd take 10 mins to cook. Was probably thinking why would we order that.   Fried rice- typical but way better than fast food.   Customer service- nice people! Took orders immediately  Wait time- 30 mins for us on a Monday at 2 pm with 6 people. Had a group of 5 and 3 groups of 2 go before us but we were actually third on the list. Very difficult to get seating immediately anyways. Space has about 30 seats or so.

I always order the tonkatsu shoyu because I feel like the mixture of the shoyu broth cuts the saltiness and richness of the tonkatsu alone. I always ask for the thicker noodle and add corn and egg for my perfect bowl. I've tried the miso but it's too salty for me.   Another must have is their pork belly bowl. Their chashu  and sauce is perfect on top of rice with some of that red ginger.   Make sure not to go at peak times cause there's always a line since seating is limited.",

    "text": "Suffice to say Monta has become the next best thing to hit Vegas since fried rice, but WHY you may wonder did I only give it a 4 star? As you may all have read the rest of the 400+reviews & counting, everyone is raving about the food at Monta & the prices, and I definitely agree with all the positive reviews, I mean c'mon you have a Menu that would fit in one sheet of paper, how can you mess that one up? They have followed the In N Out Burger's mantra...KISSS (keep it simple st*p*d) Less is More, No Frills, No guess work, in fact I love everything on their menu so much it is so hard for me to pick just one item! The only disadvantage to the \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\" attitude is that it GETS BORING, and you might get Monta'd out (especially if you are eating there almost every week sometimes two) I guess some good things must come to an end, and as the Law of Gravity dictates, what comes up, must come down, even if it is THE BEST noodle & chiar su pork in town. With this popularity also comes one downfall....BE PREPARED TO WAIT FOR A TABLE! Especially during the peak hours of lunch & dinner. They open at 11 am and trust me there is a line already forming outside waiting for them to open. this is a sure way to tell that a place is sure to be good especially when it's packed, but what if you are really hungry already??? Hmmm bring some crackers with you. Keep in mind also that at Monta it is first come first serve, you can not make reservations, nor will they seat you if your whole party is not there yet (they FROWN upon this) Monta is suitable for parties of a maximum of 4 if your party is more than that you probably won't sit together or even eat at the same time. The waiting time is often discouraging, HUNGRY PEOPLE are ANGRY PEOPLE! It has happened on more than one occasion that we had to go somewhere else because we got discouraged by the slew of people waiting to be seated anplay how pressed for time we already are. So by now you probably figured out why it is missing that 1 more star, Me & Monta definitely have a Love-Hate relationship. Like in any other relationship, if you fall too quickly, you will fall out as quickly as you fell. So for now or until I crave you again, SAYUNARA Monta-san.",

Away from the strip, in a tiny, almost deserted strip mall area.  I actually bumped into this place as i was headed to the Korean BBQ place next door, but once we arrived, my wife wanted to try ramen.  I'm glad she made that choice!  We've been back to Monta 3 times - and we don't live in Vegas - and still haven't gotten into the Korean BBQ place yet!",

The broth is a mix of the two styles of broth from Japan; a bit sour but with the miso taste in it.  Four stars as while I've no complaints on the food, and they also have a liquor liscence which is cool, the restaurant only seats about 24 so if you want to eat, be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes when the place is full (and it always is).  If you get there about 5 minutes before it opens you'll be able to get a seat; getting your bill is also a bit of a challenge but overall a great experience.  Lastly, the service has been dropping off as of late; for such a small place getting your bill shouldn't be so hard.",

I thought that there would be at least a shrimp item..maybe a fish?  Noooooooope. Not a one. Swing and a miss Vanessa. The miso soup is made withpork and chicken so that was out too. Oh well, my friend had been here before and really likes it, and I was staaaaarving, so I got the white rice and added corn, mustard greens and scallions.  Was ok.  I also got the cold noodle ramen with sesame. It was good however, this is not a place I will come back to. Honestly, there are no options and I would not want to get what I got again. The prices are ok, the staff was very nice. And my food was good, but not great for me to return.",

As I'm sure you've heard the place only seats about 20 people at a time and there is often times a wait, but it's very much worth it. Their menu is quite small but everything on there is a knock out. Feeling like you can't go wrong when you order is an awesome feeling. I personally order the Shoyu ramen with corn and fried rice, the first time i tired this I knew there was a heaven. It's so savory and authentic, if you ever go, take a spoonful of the fried rice dip it in the broth and I GUARANTEE your taste buds will be enraptured with a euphoric taste. The price is fairly cheap as well around $15 a person. The waitresses are very friendly as well and always take time to teach me some new Japanese every time I go. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for something different within a reasonable prince range.",

The parking lot has decent amount of space for people to go in and out ok with possible short waits for spots. Coming in, this place is very tight and small. There's not much room for even 5 people to wait before getting seated. And seating itself barely has much room either. Just enough for people to get around ok.   The ramen (my family members and I all tried each ramen they offered) was all pretty salty and felt quite heavy. The fried rice dishes were good but not anything that stands out. Overall, everything seemed quite average or not to our personal liking.   The service here was alright as well. They seem busy so that may be why they could come off rude and rushed. They're not the most helpful either.   We're glad we gave it a try. It wasn't bad but we probably won't be thinking to come here.",

I went in at about 11:35 A.M. - 5 minutes after they open - and the place was almost completely full. I got a seat at one of the stools, so got the heat in my face but a good view of the action happening in the kitchen. And, yes, the hostesses are Japanes  I ordered the Black Garlic 'Tonkotsu' (pork broth), with extra 'Chashu' (roast pork) and 'Nitamago' (half-boiled egg). (I also ordered a 'kaedama' (extra serving) after I finished the first bowl of noodles.) The wait was about 15 minutes, which is understandable considering the number of people already here when I arrived.  The broth was just the way I like it: not overly salty, thick, and not overpowering; the flavor was just right. The cuts of meat were about average and not very thick. Although it tasted good, it didn't really wow me.  I should've ordered gyoza or a small fried rice to see how they do with other dishes before just handing them a score. For now, definitely 4 stars at the very least, but I'm guessing could easily be 5 stars if their other plates are good.",

Located in a small strip mall along Spring Mountain, Monta Ramen had zero curb appeal and would be easy to overlook had it not been for the line of people waiting outside.  The restaurant's dining area was small, cramped, and much like its exterior, no frills.  Basically, it actually did remind me somewhat of the noodle shops I experienced when I lived in Japan.  I had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen ($6.95) with Chashu pork (+$2.50), and Nitamago, a seasoned hard-boiled egg (+$1.50).  I liked that the ramen broth possessed the expected umami notes and was perfectly seasoned and didn't overwhelm my taste buds with saltiness as some ramen broths will do.  I was very happy with my choice.  Apparently, many people felt that same as I did as the dining room was filled by the sounds of people slurping up noodles and people lined out the door on the list waiting to grab our table when we left.  Monta Ramen was just what the doctor ordered, solid ramen at a reasonable (to me) price.  I easily understand why it's a local favorite.  I'd gladly come back for more.",

Next, it is SOOOO AFFORDABLE! These days ramen is expensive and not affordable. Yes I understand making the broth and the other ingredients are costly. However, Monta manages to keep the bowls to under $10, that is a STEAL!   The tonkotsu broth is full of flavor and has depth. I personally prefer the wavy noodles so I sub out the thin for the wavy. Order an egg, and share with your partner. It is all enough to be full!   Oh yea parking at this lot is difficult.",

I watched one particular waiter named Bryan just go from table to table, cleaning up, setting up, and calling the next party on the list. The other staff were very kind and did the most to satisfy your needs. Though the wait time was ridiculous i have mad respect for the staff here.   The food was also really good. I had the black garlic one but i actually kind of wished I got the tonkotsu because i tried my mum's and it was so good. The pork was so tender, it just melts in your mouth.   The venue was small but id say quite clean. I felt very comfortable there.  Sadly i'm only here on vacation but i loved coming here after eating burgers for the past 4 days.",

    "text": "It seems like the ramen joints in Vegas have all been well received and are quite popular. With over 2000 reviews on Yelp, I figured this place had to be pretty good.   Monta is located in a very busy plaza with limited parking spots - and since the storefront is pretty small itself, you can expect to either be cramped in the waiting area or standing outside waiting for a table. I came when the weather was still very cold, so a bunch of people were inside trying to avoid the frigid air. Even on a weekday night, the wait was around 45 minutes long. It seems like eating in parties of 2 or 4 are most convenient and larger parties will have to wait until everybody is here until they can be seated. There's a small bar section and several small tables that can be combined.  Menu is simple. They advertise which ramen bowls are their most popular; however, they have tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and a black garlic oil ramen. Prices are actually on the very affordable side, with bowls costing around $7-8; however, there are very limited ingredients in the pre-set bowl. You can add additional toppings if you wish.   I was really curious about their kuro ramen with black garlic oil ($7.95). I added a flavored egg for $1.50 more but I was a little disappointed to see that the yolk was not as soft and yolky as I wanted it to be. But the bamboo shoots and pork chashu were on-point. I thought the broth was very flavorful and rich. Could actually taste the oil after several sips. I liked that the thin noodles were still kind of chewy, making each bite pleasant to eat. I would recommend this if you're not sure what to order and want to try something different.   Tonkotsu ramen ($6.95) did have a creamy and rich flavored broth. This was probably my favorite broth because of it was lighter than the black garlic oil. It was simple, but packed a punch in every bite. Thin noodles were also a part of this ramen.   Shoyu ramen ($6.95) was the least favorite among the three bowls. I don't think chicken broth is any good with ramen, and it reflected in this bowl. Very bland and lacked flavor; however, this bowl did have medium thick wavy noodles, which I liked.   We also ordered a regular pork belly bowl on the side to share. Very reminiscent of Yoshinoya's beef bowl, except this is made with pork belly. The pork belly was tasty and the sauce that the pork was cooked in seeped into the rice, giving it extra flavor. I can see why people recommended this appetizer. I would order this again if I could. Even eating the leftovers the next day, it was still tasty.   tl;dr - If you're a fan of ramen and like checking out new ramen joints, I suggest giving Monta a try. I don't think it was anything spectacular, but I can see why people like this place a lot. The bowls of ramen (besides the shoyu) were pretty solid. But because the area is so small and cramped, come early or be prepared for a wait.",

Spicy Tonkatsu with a flavor egg ($9.45) - The broth was super milky and flavorful. It wasn't super fatty as you would think. The ramen noodles were cooked well and the chashu was super tender!  A little disappointed an egg isn't already included in the bowl and that it was extra.   Tonkatsu Shoyu with a flavor egg ($8.45) - my boyfriend ordered this and I only had a taste of the broth and I found it to be pretty good too. Its his favorite and it didn't seem too salty.   Small chashu bowl ($3.95) - it's a small order but honestly the bowl itself is a good size. The chashu is the same thing you get in the ramen bowl. Super tender and soft.   Overall - Great ramen. We cleaned our bowl ramen, soup and all! I've read people have had long waits. Glad I came here at the time i did. It definitely fixed my ramen craving and it's not too far away from the strip. Would definitely come back here!",

    "text": "BIG DROP-OFF since the last time I dined here, which was probably a year ago when I came here with some friends and let me say that My friends and I  liked this place so much that we literally came here 3 days straight!!! I raved about this place so much to my girlfriend back home in Austin, so the expectations from us were pretty high coming in on a Monday evening around 7 o'clock. The wait time was about 20 min., so it wasn't too bad and the restaurant was pretty full. So I ordered 3 of my fav dishes I had last time to share with my girlfriend. We had miso ramen w/ ajitama (seasoned egg) and corn, Kim chi fried rice, and cold noodles with sesame sauce...so  Miso ramen- broth was a lil salty and luke  warm, cold corn (which prob made the broth luke warm), the noodles were stuck together in a ball shape, so that was obvious it wasn't boiled long enough.   Kim chi Fried rice- was very wet and was obvious drenched with a lot of oil  Cold noodles- were a bit sour and visibly covered with way too much sesame sauce.  I really don't understand the big drop off in the quality of taste and food and it saddens me to just give Monta 1 star ( star for good service) which seems harsh, but when you get food poisoning that causes your stomach to ache and many trips to the restrooms. How could you consider to go back...",

We went on a Tuesday night and their small space was packed to the brim. We put our name on the waiting list and were seated in about 15-20 minutes of coming in.  I decided to get the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen. The food came out decently fast, even with how busy they were, so thats a plus. The food was absolutely delicious and I have nothing bad to say about it! But it kind of tasted like every other ramen I've had before so it wasn't anything special.  Overall, this place is a great place to go when you're craving a good bowl of ramen but don't go on a busy night. The space is insanely small so you most likely wouldn't get seated for over an hour. The ramen is good but it isn't worth the wait.",

This place was crowded both times (and the strip mall parking is usually full).  But you go in, sign your name on the clipboard and wait for the goodness.  It's a small place that churns and burns.  I love that they have cold oolong tea in a can.  Once you order, food comes out fast.  If you're in Vegas and you happen to love ramen, get off the strip, and eat here.",

    "text": "This is the first time that I'll thank a monsoon (Thank You!). If it wasn't for that freak storm that swept through the Chinatown area, my boyfriend and I probably wouldn't have found seating at Monta Ramen. Only those who are really serious about ramen will brave flooded intersections for a hot bowl of noodles -- that, or your Plan A for dinner fell through.   I almost didn't want to come here because of the issue I have with the lack of seating at this place, but we took the chance and dropped in anyway. We figured not many people would hit up Monta because the weather was lookin' ominous. Two open spots were free when we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night, but the tiny restaurant was almost filled to maximum occupancy. By the way, if you see seats available, don't forget to put your name down on the sign-in sheet by the doorway; it's still first come, first served.   I stuck with what I ordered on my last visit which was the Tonkotsu Ramen with nori and nitamago. I was pleased to learn that the ramen was still solid like the last time I had it several months ago. The broth was hearty and the pork was tender. I also shared an order of the Mini Pork Belly Bowl.  As much as I enjoyed my ramen, I almost want to say that the pork belly was my favorite part of dinner. It was flavorful and delicious, and I prefer it over the Mini Mentaiko Bowl that I ordered last time.  Unlike other ramen restaurants I've been to, Monta has about four ramen selections to choose from; however, you won't pay over $8.00 for a bowl. Overall, the food here is affordable. Two bowls of ramen and the pork belly came out to a little over $23.00 (without tip.)  Bumped up my rating for Monta from a 4 to a 5, all thanks to that Pork Belly Bowl and how the quality of the food has remained consistent.",

The waitress brought our our nori in a separate bowl and only charged us for the corn which was 25 cents cheaper than the nori :)   The ramen was so good!

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place when my wife said she heard about a new ramen joint that serves Hakata tonkotsu ramen.  The restaurant is minimalist with very little seating and is located next door to Raku. We generally don't sweat the decor, or lack thereof, as long as the food is good.  They offer shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu ramen and several other items on their menu. We ordered the tonkotsu, of course, which was $7 for a small-medium sized bowl. They used the thin white classic tonkotsu ramen noodles which were decent but lacked the elasticity or chewy \"freshness factor\" of other places we've tried. As my wife will attest to, I like my food salty and flavorful, but their broth was a bit too salty, even for me. It had an earthy shiitake mushroom flavor but was lacking in the porky flavor and richness of a good tonkotsu broth. Neither of us cared to slurp up any of the broth once we were done with the noodles. I found the two pieces of chashu were mediocre at best. They were somewhat tough and fatty and had this unusual ring of gelatin around the edges.  This place is arguably the best ramen place in Vegas that we have found so far. Unfortunately that also isn't saying very much. A mere year ago, both of us would probably have been more than satisfied with Monta. Damn you Ichiran for making ramen snobs out of us and forever raising our ramen bar! The search continues for better ramen in Vegas...",

This tiny little noodle shop (I think they might only seat like 25) has a counter and like 4 small tables.  The menu is limited to 3 types of noodle soup, a couple of entrees and some sides.    I ordered the miso noodle soup with an egg...  Perfectly done noodles in a rich, perfectly seasoned broth, served with a few slices of pork and some vegetables mixed in...  and the egg... AMAZING.  They have somehow figured out how to boil an egg so that the white is fully cooked, yet the center is slightly thinkened yet runny, and served it on top of my noodle soup, cut in half like a hard boiled egg.  Fascinating and delicious.  This place is definitely making it into my lunch rotation.  SOOO GOOD.",

The whole restaurant only fits about 26 people but we were lucky we were the only customers.  I went with my boyfriend and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen w/ egg and he had the miso w/ corn, egg & extra chashu. Even in the heat I definitely enjoyed the ramen. The broth was very savory and delicious. The chashu was very soft and also very flavorful. I would definitely order the extra chashu next time we go there. I've never had corn in my ramen before (except for the american cuponoodles) but it added a nice crunch to the dish and sweetness.  The service was good but just be careful with your bill there. This was the first time we went there and they rang up 3 cokes instead of 2. After the transaction was completed she had corrected it by giving us cash back for the misrung item. After leaving the restaurant and being a day later, we came to realized the server charged his debit card TWICE for the meal as well. So not only did they rang up extra items on our tab but they charged the transaction TWICE.  Keep in mind that we were the only people in the restaurant as well so it wasn't like it was very busy.   Overall I was happy with the meal, just will keep in mind to pay cash and triple check the tab from now on.",

    "text": "Finally! A very good Ramen joint in Vegas. This place is much more the real Japanese ramen joint than the (now defunct) Togoshi Ramen.  Monta is in a small strip mall on Sprint Mountain Rd, just West of Decatur. It is very easy to miss as you go by. And the shop is very small, with only four 4 place table, 1 2 place table, and about 10 counter seats. They only accept cash so beware.  I recently learned of this place right here on yelp and had to give it a try. Like others on this forum, I grew up eating fantastic ramen all over Japan. And have long been searching... I was elated when Santouka came to the states and even more ecstatic when local joints like Orenchi (Cupertino, CA) that are very much like the ramen I used to know in Japan... started to pop up.  I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I like tonkotsu, thick chijirimen (wavy noodles) usually, so I am usually biased towards that. Monta has 4 basic types of ramen flavors: Tonkotsu, Shoyu, Miso, and new (at least it said new today) Tonkotsu Shoyu which is a combination of the Tonkotsu and Shoyu broths.  Tonkotsu, of course, is pork based broth. The Shoyu uses chicken broth (according to Monta), but I also detected some dashi (fish based) in there as well. Tonkotsu, and Tonkotsu Shoyu uses thin straight noodles. Shoyu and Miso uses the thick wavy noodles. Each ramen @  $6.95 comes with 2 slices of char shu, kikurage (woodear mushrooms), memma (seasoned bamboo shoots), and chopped green onions. There are other toppings available as mentioned in other reviews, along with kaedama (literally means \"replacement ball\") extra noodles.  Kaedama is usually ordered as you go, not in the beginning. This is because if get it at the same time as your ramen, then the noodles either go cold, or get overcooked. This is one of the reasons why I do not like places that have a \"Large\" size. By the time you're half way through, the noodles are too overcooked. I commend Monta for doing the kaedama the right way.  Anyway, I was @ Monta today, Thu, at 2 pm, and the place had a waiting list 8 deep! It took us abobut 20 minutes to get seated, and as we got seated, the wait line even got longer. OK... my expectations are way high... but be cautious... this, after all, is the only ramen only joint in Vegas....  I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu with nitamago and extra char shu. My wife had the Shoyu with nitamago. We also had gyoza. In the kitchen, there are basically 2 guys preparing the dishes. One guy that does the ramen, another that does the fried rice and others. And with the packed house, the service was slow.  But when the ramen finally came, I was not disappointed. Despite my doubts, the Tonkotsu Shoyu had a wonderful balance and marriage of pork and chicken broth. My wife's Shoyu, I believe due to the chicken stock, had a very mellow aspect to it which also gave the Tonkotsu a very mellow and non-overpowering flavor. I finished the broth to the last drop, including my wife's Shoyu/Chicken broth.  The noodles... My thin noodles were not overcooked, and about just right when my ramen came out. But because of its thinness, by the time I got half way through my ramen (and I'm a relatively quick ramen eater, beating my wife by a good 10 minutes :-)) was way overcooked and mushy soft. Next time, I will see if they will cook it less (katame, or as I do at Kyushu Jyangara in Tokyo, bari-kata... crispy as in ironed with starch). My wife's chijirimen was very good with good amount of al dente,a and the chewiness one expects in good ramen.  If I can't get them to cook the thin noodles to super al dente, then my backup plan is to have them use the thick noodles in the Tonkotsu ramen.  The boiled egg is soft boiled, but the yolk does not run. I like my soft boiled egg a with a bit more runny yolk. But nevertheless it was still good. The Char shu was one the the better ones I had in the states. very tender, melts in your mouth, with good flavor... not too over powering, not too bland. The slices were on the thin side, but I got a total of 8 slices by ordering the extra char shu topping ($2.50).   In summary both the Tonkotsu Shoyu and Shoyu ramens were done very well, with a good balance of broth, noodles, and toppings in a dish that came together very very well. Too many times, I have been to ramen places in the states where the broth may be good, but noodles lack, or vice versa, or even where all the individual ingredients are good, but the finished product just doesn't cut it.  The gyoza, unlike one reviewer here, I though were also very good. I would beg to differ that this is not like store bought gyoza as it is stuffed with pork whereas the store bought ones are more heavy on the nappa cabbage and not stuffed. The flavor is also very good, however, I like my gyoza wet...that is with a bit more juice as you bite into them.  In the end though, I give Monta 5 stars even with the few deficiencies. Monta, in my book, share the top honors with Orenchi in Cupertino,",

We were super excited to see that this place specializes in Hakata-style pork broth ramen.  Hmmm... well... so far, it's one of the best bowl of ramen we've had in Vegas (but that doesn't necessarily say much). There is certainly a good amount of porky flavour in the broth... but not enough to make it really stand up  on its own (ie, make me want to drink the whole bowl and wonder if I can ask for more).  Also, there is a hint of the distinctive earthy shitake mushroom which does take away from the flavour of the pork.  The noodles are classic tonkotsu ramen noodles but they lacked the nice chew of others we've tried. The chashu was okay - a little on the fatty side, mildly tough but great flavour.  Overall, it's not bad, it's closer than LA (which has some really great ramen establishments), and pretty good value for your money.",

Hubby had the tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen with green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage and added nori. I shared with our daughter the tonkotsu-shoyu (pork bone & special shoyu base) ramen with green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage and added nori and a hard boiled egg.  We also had fried rice with pork, kimchi and extra chashu pork.  Our food was served fast, and the ramen and broth were tasty and the fried rice was delicious.",

My only suggestion is I wish they had other kinds of ramen like chicken or seafood. I do get tired of pork sometimes!",

While I was browsing reviews for another place (Fukumimi), the common thing locals were saying were that Monta was better, so why not! The plus side is they are open past 10PM, which baffles me that buffets on the strip close at 10PM.  I love the simplicity of the menu options. Was so glad that bean sprouts aren't even included in the ramen (except for their cold dish) because let's be real, bean sprouts are used for fillers most of the time.  The broth was awesome and probably the best tonkotsu I've had to date. It could get rich after awhile, so come hungry!  I also ordered mine with their nitamago (hard boiled eggs), and these were the good ones that have been soaking in broth goodness, not just sliced and added on top, so it was melty goodness.  This place is definitely going on my top ramen places and will be visited again next time I'm in Vegas.",

But don't wait to come then get there before! There is always a line by 1115-1120 when I usually am nonchalantly rushing to the line in fear I'll miss my window of opportunity to enjoy my oh so fabulous bowl of noodles. It is small and fills up fast and they don't seat you unless your whole party is there which sends me into another panic until The boyfriend shows up and I can breathe again. Also they only seat singles at the bar heads up, no table for you, no room for your laptop, this is not a working lunch spot. In and out. Once you're done you'll feel the eyes stating at you till you leave with your head down feeling like you might have taken just a little too long to enjoy your grub.   The service is always spot on and fast. Sometimes they ask if its ok sometimes not, I don't care though its always good! Sometimes being the first customers the wait for the food is sometimes sluggish with all the orders going in at once but I understand and gives us time to chat and admire the others. I always get my Ramen with corn and butter hold the shrooms. Yea I know they're not poisonous but these shrooms are just weird to me. The Boyfriend gets the Pork Belly Bowl and always shares generously, we'd have a fight on our hands if he didn't. This thing is to die for! Yummy baconey porky deliciousness! You won't regret it!",

    "text": "Came to Vegas for vacation and my friend kept telling me that I must try this place out.  I am from out of town so I cant really tell you where this place is at since I took a taxi but it seems like the Chinatown of Vegas.  It seems to be sorta hidden in the back of the shopping center but just look for the white sign.  Got here around 12pm and there was a slight wait (nothing compared the wait when we were leaving).  Sat down and the friendly waitress took my order: Shoyu Ramen with corn and also the small fried rice (my friend said i had to get it no matter what) and yes I know thats a lot of carbs.  Shoyu Ramen:  my ramen came out with extra chasu and with no corn.  the waitress quickly realized this and immediatly gave me some corn on the side and didnt charge me for the extra chasu (kudos to her to rectify the situation).  The broth was very good and not overly salty.  I consider this one of the better ramens that I have eaten.  But the thing that stood out the most to me are the noodles.  Wow! This has got to be one of the best noodles ive eaten at any ramen joint and I have been to many in NY, CA and Hawaii.  Many places forsake the noodles and focus too much on the broth and chasu but very very good noodles.  Fried Rice: this was the dish my friend kept raving about and keep telling me to order.  I am not a huge fried rice person but it was pretty darn good! I devoured it within minutes of it coming out and didnt even leave a spec for my friend.  Very good place I will definitely come again when I go to Vegas.",

Keep in mind the place is super tiny, maybe seats 20 at most...and A/C doesn't really work so it is like sitting in a UPS truck(not that I've ever been in one but...u get the idea)  We were seated almost right away even though there were ppl waiting in front of us(perhaps they are in large groups).  The lady who seated us was really nice, later on there was another waitress who brought our ramen to us, cute and also nice(I think it is probably the owner and her daughter as they look alike), of course the 5 stars isn't based on the looks but honestly it does help a little(even without it, the ramen itself still deserves 5 stars).  We tried the #1 tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles, it was very rich in flavor, but our favorite was the Kuro ramen(the tonkotsu broth with black garlic oil), it was superb! and the chashu was not only buttery but also taste like it was grilled first!  There is also a shave ice place in same plaza which is also very good, and a foot massage place(make sure you yelp for the one with 4 stars, not the one with 1 star... :P)  I hope they open one in LA soon!",

When you finally find it in this strip mall the whole in the wall is a treasure. You can tell you are there because there is always people waiting out side and cars all around the one door.  This place is SMALL and HOT! There is a little wrap around bar that holds about 6-8 people and then maybe 5 tables. It is warm in there but no one seems to care. Everyone just eats there hot ramen noodles in the hot restaurant.  The ramen is so yummy! Get the egg added to your soup. That is the only add on I would recommend.

It was busy so it must be some legit ramen. I was greeted by a Japanese server and was seated at the bar. I noticed that the entire kitchen staff was not even close to being Japanese.  I dunno....I was getting skeptical about this place. I'd rather of had a non Japanese working front of house and seeing an actual Japanese preparing the food. Nothing against it but it just adds to the authenticity in my opinion.  Ordered the miso ramen and tried to take a pic but wouldn't you know it, the hot vegas sun had overheated my phone and I couldn't take any. Eh looks like ramen. Good broth. Good noodles. Good price Fast service. Eh, maybe Hisjapanic ramen isn't too bad. I'll return when I come back to Vegas.",

If I remember correctly, I think they have purse hooks under the counter. =)  We got the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with thick wavy noodles and Kumo Ramen. The pork just melts in your mouth!!!

Raku was closed, and I know Monta has a following so we headed here.   To be honest, the second I was handed a menu, I wanted to leave. There are 3 main ramen choices and none sounded off the wall great. Lawrence said he was fine staying and he ordered tea. It was canned. I thought that was a little bizarre.   I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and a side of kimchi and he had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen. When it came out it smelled like... pancakes! It was the weirdest thing. It smelled like a \"bowl\" of pancakes. The soup was actually pretty good, and I added a bunch of sesame oil and cayenne and garlic. It was good (even though I got cayenne pepper in my eye somehow.) Lawrence said he liked his soup too. The kimchi was the most bland I ever had and I wouldn't order it again. Regardless, the noodles were good.  If this place had more to choose from, I might come back, but as it stands, I'm still gonna make my way around the other restaurants in town.",

Everytime we order the ramen, we will pay $2.5 for 4 more pieces of the chashu because it is just so good. For the chashu bowl, i think it's soso because the chashu is fried. Therefore it's not as good as those that are in the ramen. And i think the pork belly bowl is soso too, nothing special about it. For the fried rice, I think it tastes good and smells good. I had only tried the \"fried rice\". I didnt try the one with kimchi and veggie. And for the gyoza, I think it is okay. Nothing special about it too.  Overall, I would recommend you to try there ramen and fried rice. And for this price, it's really cheap and delicious !!! :D   And it's the best to go there at around 3pm so you do not have to wait for a long time. It's pretty crowded during noon and at night.",

    "text": "If I could rate each thing individually, I would.  Food flavor and quality-always was and will be 5 star. It's incredible and I crave it.   Wait time-average. 3.5 stars.  Quantity of food-5 star. You get tons of food. I usually get two meals out of one order that I take to go.  Parking-BLOWS. 1 star. Barely ever any room. You're better off parking on that side street.  Atmosphere/building- 2 stars. Cramped, tiny. They really need to expand and fast.  Service- 0 stars. I've only had to come in here once and I don't know if I'll be back based on this alone, no matter how damn good it is.  We walk in to a cramped/stuffed area full of people waiting- a patron is nice enough to tell me I have to \"sign my name on the pedestal\". I said \"I just want it to go\" and she didn't say anything, just kind of awkwardly looked at me. I didn't sign it. All those people got seated. After waiting about 10 more min of not being acknowledged, a waitress finally asked if I was waiting for a party of people, I said no, I just want to order to go. She came back 5 min later with a menu. I told her I already know what I wanted-she was already at a table next to me saying \"yes, they were first\". I'm aware, hence the reason they're at a table.   At that moment in time I was ready to explode \"could someone just fvcking tell me what I'm supposed to do to order to go so I'm not standing here like an asssh*le??!?!?!\" I was furious by the time I left. I couldn't be courteous anymore. If this is how noodle houses in Las Vegas go, they are all run sloppy and poorly organized, then white-girl-me can't deal with this, count me out. I sincerely hope other noodle-based places aren't like this, because now I really have motivation to try other ones.  Perhaps to avoid confusion, I should take an asian friend with me to break the barrier a little? I heard once that it's because Monta waitresses don't understand English well-this does not excuse the poor execution of guest-ferrying and certainly doesn't welcome new people to the establishment.",

The server said    something along the lines of \"No.\" and so my parents decided to take this dilemma into their own hands and asked if they could just move the table of regularly 4 and the other 4 table together and just leave the table for 2 alone to the side for other guests and the server straight up said \" NO WE DONT WANT TO.\" We had already been seated but the rest of us had to remain standing in the already crammed area trying to negotiate with the server. In the front there were multiple parties of 4 or more just watching this happen. We ended up just sitting down at both settings. What I'm trying to say is Monta staff on Spring Valley sucks.",

    "text": "You can tell food is good when people are willing to stand in line (which is often out the door) to wait through our blistering summers and biting winters.  Luckily, service and cook time are quick, so I have never had to wait more than fifteen minutes or so for a table or spot even when it's crowded.    Monta is a small, hole in the wall ramen place.  There are three kinds of seating: booth, table and bar stools.  If you're eating solo or you have a small party, you'll probably get seated more quickly because the individual bar stools will open up.  Additionally, so they can keep the flow going and keep wait times down, you'll have to sign in on a sheet, and they won't seat you until your entire party is present.  From the bar, you can see the crew in the kitchen cooking the meals.  On to the food.  I normally order the Tonkot-Shoyu (mixed broth of the Tonkotsu and Shoyu) with corn and nori (dried seaweed), and add in some chili oil and spices from the table set.  The soup itself comes with chashu pork, bamboo shoots, kikarage (black mushrooms) and green onion.  I've tried ramen at two other locations (one in the Galleria mall in Henderson, and the other was Anime Ramen) and this is definitely my favorite spot to go.  The noodles have just the right amount of chewiness, the broth is flavorful but not overpowering, and the chashu is tender, melt in your mouth goodness.    I have also tried the pork belly bowl and gyoza, and both are pretty good.  I wish they had a different sauce for the gyoza, but soy sauce mixed with vinegar and a little chili oil works just fine.  I've only discovered this place in the last year, but I can honestly say it's become one of my go-to restaurants and it's definitely a comfort food.  Prices are more expensive than your fifty cent package of Top Ramen, but it's still cheap for a restaurant at under ten dollars an entree.    My only bone to pick is that their green tea is only chilled and it comes in a can, though as far as canned green tea goes, it's not bad.",

The outside smell is awful, but you forget about the stench when inside the restaurant. The restaurant is small inside, but the food comes out quickly once you're in. The waitresses are always friendly and very quick to put in orders and bring drinks and refills. The miso and Kuro ramen were our favorites, but the pork belly and rice bowl is outstanding. The dish is flavorful and a decent size. Our 5 and 8 year old boys polished one bowl on their own. I love that they offer the option to add more noodles to your extra broth for only $1.50. We both added extra this last time. We will definitely be back to this place since we can't help but crave their ramen!",

Nonetheless, I visited Monta recently and must say I was impressed. I tried the shoyu ramen, although my friend recommended I try the tonkotsu. I thought it was pretty tasty though! I think it would be interesting to eat at the bar, like you were at a ramen place in Tokyo or Sapporo (David Chang's quarterly, Lucky Peach is all about different types of ramen, very interesting).   I can't say with certainty if the noodles are made in-house though.  BUT you get a lot of bang for a buck. i will be returning to try the tonkatsu and other items from the menu.",

Options are limited since the menu is very small. The place itself is very small, but I think exclusivity is part of its charm. Every time I go there, it is busy and there is usually a little bit of a wait. There is a smal; bench outside for people to wait. Different hours of the day allow for different amounts of waits. There is a sign in sheet, so make sure to get your name on it ASAP. There is a drink that I get every time I am there called CALPICO. It's a non-carbonated soft drink. I know, I'm still trying to wrap my head around that idea as well. It's sweet and amazing. It's hard not to keep sipping on it while waiting for your food.",

Though they were aware that we had moved our name from the wrong sheet to the right sheet and had been waiting for 40 minutes, they sat a party of 6 that had only been waiting for ten minutes or so.  They then proceeded to tell us \"oh well, we can't do anything for you, really, you should have put your name on the right sheet the first time.\"  Only when I told them we were going to leave and go somewhere else did they try to scramble to get a table together.  They're only in it for profit.  I just can't believe that they would treat people who visit them monthly like dirt.

I went with several friends and one of them had suggested it. He is into food and so I thought to give it a shot. The restaurants in and around the area of this one, usually deliver, on what I mentioned above, that this one is lacking.  After waiting to get seated in the small restaurant, we were greeted quickly. What happened next was weird. We waited for almost 20 minutes before a member of the wait staff arrived to take our order. It took entirely too long for simple noodles in heated broth to arrive. It takes me two and a half minutes to make similar noodles and another two minutes to plate everything.  If you go during the Summer, which is always in Vegas, be ready for heat inside. Like another Yelper has mentioned, due to its size, this place stays hot and has little to no airflow.  For three people that ordered the standard fair and no beverages, the final bill should not have been anywhere near $40, but that's what I got.",

    "text": "A friend from Los Angeles recommended this ramen joint to me.  \"Not the same but good enough\" were his exact words comparing it to Daikokuya.  Monta Ramen is literally in the midst of other small Asian food joints in a mini-strip mall in Las Vegas' Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road.  I honestly would have not known this place existed if my friend didn't tell me  about it.  Parking was, for one, a bit limited.    I walked in to a small, maybe 6 (or 7?)  tables and the counter bar, stuffy and unventilated ramen joint.  It had the same feel of Daikokuya:  cramped and rushed.  There were people standing, waiting and blocking the door.  I was offered to sit on the bar but there was no elbow room so I stood up and told the lady I would wait for a table instead.  The wait staff are Japanese, but noticed 2 Latinos working behind the bar/kitchen with an Asian guy.  Red flag I thought but then again I saw the framed accolades from different local papers and publications honoring and awarding Monta as the Best or one of the Best in Las Vegas.     I sat down in one of the small tables and ordered their tonkatsu ramen ($6.95).   The bowls are smaller, I noticed, and they're somewhat stingy with everything, including the broth and the toppings.  I had a couple small slices of chasu, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and green onions.  Mine didn't come with marinated boiled egg.  I come to find out that you can order the toppings for extra charge.  Really? for an egg?   The broth was a bit salty to my liking, heavy and tasted like it was enriched with milk or cream, or maybe miso.  The wavy thinner noodles were somewhat seasoned too, but not overwhelmingly salty.  Their chasu, however, is to die for!  It's perfectly seasoned, cooked, caramelized and charred to my personal standards!  For that alone, I will come back and try their chasu rice bowl.  For their ramen soups?  I might try a different one the next time around, and maybe request thicker noodles.  Sidenote:  Monta Ramen was shut down by the Southern Nevada Health Department in mid March 2013 for 47 demerits, but have since re-inspected and reopened.",

It was flavorful, clean, and well balance. The one thing that threw me off were the noodles. I'm use to the regular ramen noodle size, but they appear to have given me the super fine ramen noodles. My friend who order the same broth as I did got the same noodles as I did, but everyone else got the regular noodles. Either way it was good, if I was to come back I would just ask for the regular noodles.   I added extra meat and an egg. I wish the egg was standard like most places.   Overall, great quality.

When I read in some reviews that this wasn't the type of place you linger at, I was afraid that service might be a bit brusque. Nope! You get an enthusiastic greeting of \"Irasshaimase!\" from the couple of servers on the floor and the noodle chefs in the open kitchen behind the bar. Our server was courteous and we did not feel hurried. There's counter seating around the bar and maybe 5 four-tops in addition. It's not a big place, so there might be a wait if your party is larger than one or two. The AC was cranked up, which made for a very pleasant dining experience, considering you're eating hot soup in the desert.  I loved the concept of standard toppings and adding what you want on top of it. I added the seasoned egg to my bowl, which had a perfectly set, slightly gooey middle. The tonkotsu was thick and cloudy, with plenty of collagen dissolved in the soup to give you that lip-smacking sensation. Noodles were perfectly chewy, although you had to slurp fast so the hot soup didn't soften them too much. They also have Sapporo on tap in schooner sizes. Perfect, because my tummy can only hold so much liquid.   This is definitely worth a stop whether you are heading into or out of Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We came here on a saturday afternoon around 1220 and it was super packed. We waited for an hourish but it's also because we had a party of 9. This place is right next to Raku and a korean restaurant.   We ordered a bowl of Tonkotsu shoyu ramen with an extra order of egg, kimchee fried rice, and gyoza. Let's actually start with the ramen which was the most disappointing dish of the 3....HOWEVER it was better than I expected. I have recently lost my hope for ramen so this place was actually better than I expected. The broth was a bit too salty for my taste but the chashu was really good. The noodles weren't bad.   The gyoza was really good. It was crispy and the inside of it was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The skin wasn't too thick so it had that perfect crispy to it when you bite into it.   The Kimchee Fried rice was the shiitttt. No joke. I think I'm gonna have dreams about the kimchee fried rice to be honest. It was moist and tasty. So much seasoning to it and there's little kick to it from the kimchee. There are restaurants that makes it super dry but Monta made it perfectly. Obviously it is oily, but it is seriously bomb-diggity good. It was sooooo good that we ordered a to-go right before we left and we ate it at midnight. We ate it cold cause there was no microwave in the hotel but it was still so damnnn good.  I would seriously come back only to get the fried rice...I'm really curious about the takana fried rice too. Service was actually really good and I actually gave Monta a 4 just because of the fried rice...or else I would probably give it a two stars.   The lesson is...you come early to avoid the wait, you get the fried rice, and be happy with life.",

    "text": "Monta Ramen is a very intimate, simple, and small ramen shop - they have a small menu as well, but that is good because it makes it easier to choose what to eat; they even scarcely have appetizers, as the only thing they really have is gyoza - other than that, it's either ramen or rice.  We've had the spicy tonkotsu ramen and tonkotsu shoyu ramen. They serve most of their ramen selection with thin noodles. I found it interesting that their broth offerings were differentiated by chicken, pork, or a combo or both. The spicy tonkotsu ramen comes with pork broth, spicy sauce, and thin noodles - the exact same as the tonkotsu ramen, but with a $1 spicy sauce extra fee. It was alright - a less creamy and oily than usual. The tonkotsu shoyu ramen is a mix of pork and chicken broth, and comes with thin noodles - the broth flavor was quite light, a lot less creamy than what I am used to (which I appreciated), had a slight syrupy consistency, and got pretty salty towards the end. The chashu pieces were extremely tender and fragile - so much that the pieces fell apart upon being picked, which was funny - I enjoyed them, but they were also thin and small slices. They also had an interesting dark brown jelly-like coating on the edges. The kikurage mushrooms and bamboo shoots were finely chopped and good and plentiful, and the amount of fresh green onions was generous. We also ordered kaedama, which was also a generous extra portion of noodles, and which basically used up the rest of the soup within the original bowl of ramen.  Overall, I prefer many other ramen places. However, you get great value at this place especially since you can currently grab a bowl of ramen for $7. The creaminess of tonkotsu broths I am used to is replaced by saltiness, which became too intense at the end. This experience can be easily skipped, but nowadays it's tough to find ramen at this good of a price. The best part of eating here was watching the chefs do cool soup and ladle movements with the ramen bowls.",

It's cheap, which is probably the appeal to most people, but I would pay a dollar or two more for a much better experience.",

We both got the kuro ramen which isn't on the menu but it's the roasted garlic one as well as the gyoza n pork belly n rice bowl. Whoa, I gotta say the broth was waaaaay too porky and thick for me. It was very fatty n had consistency of porridge. Yes the pork slices were soft and melted in your mouth but I just couldn't get over the porky soup taste. The broth wasn't hot neither, it was lukewarm. Which just made it more gross tasting. Gyoza was good and the pork belly with rice was too fatty. The green onion n ginger relish helped disguise the taste a little. Yes the food came out lightning fast and service was good but this place is just too oink oink for me. I much prefer Santouka",

As i approached the hostess and saw there were probably 25 tables still ahead of us, I asked how long is the wait? She replied with 20-40 minutes. HA ya right. But i really wanted ramen so I put our name in. We proceeded to go across the parking lot to a bar for a drink. 45 mins later we headed back, we got there to find that only 4 tables had been seated in that 45 min time frame. (NO SURPRISE) -- we waited another hour and gave up. She ended up calling us 2.5 hours later telling us our table was ready. HAHAHAHA. no thanks!",

I believe that a good food joint should always be consistent in the quality of its food. Monta ramen failed to deliver its goods the second time around: the miso ramen is extremely salty (I'm aware that miso is fermented soy based) but this miso ramen served will literally kill your kidneys and give you hypertension...beware those with high blood pressure issues! Imagine having to pay $1 extra for garlic oil.....this should be part of the kuro oil ramen one orders! I also don't believe one has to pay an additional $1.50 for an egg....hardboiled eggs should be part of the condiment for all ramen. Daikokuya in LA does it right : one standard excellent bowl of ramen with no extra cost for eggs! We're definitely not going back to Monta ramen!",

Also the char siu is very flavourful, but a little too thinly sliced.  The fried rice was also very good.  I am so happy that we finally have an authentic ramen noodle house in my backyard.

I was soooooo relieved that Monta did not disappoint as I was also feeling a bit guilty for making my friend wait so long with me.  Their ramens are surprisingly good and the broth is flavorful, but not overly heavy. I ordered the tonkatsu broth with chashu and egg. The chashu was fork tender and I really appreciated that the yolk was not fully cooked. We also LOVED their Mentaiko bowl. The scallion, nori and touch of soy with the mentaiko was a match made in heaven. We went back on our last night in Vegas just to have it for the last time.   Making the trek to CT for Monta is so worthed it. The bill plus tip and RT taxi fare will be cheaper than any comparable restaurant you find on the strip.",

The noodles are fresh and the broth, whether tonkatsu, miso, or shoyu, is always steaming hot and extremely flavorful.  I appreciate that it's the real stuff and not the packaged, powder crap other places use.    Yes, Monta is a noodle house but their fried rice is just as good, if not better.  For someone who doesn't really like fried rice, I would come just for that.  Their gyoza was just okay.  I've had better.     Even though the place is (extremely) small, I like that it's cozy.  There was only one time when I actually had to wait for a table, but as always, the wait was worth it.    A basic bowl of ramen will cost you almost $8.  That's kind of steep, especially in the economy that we're in now.  An extra $1.50 for a hard boiled egg also seems a bit much, don't you think?  I guess it's really quality over quantity with this place.   Four out of five stars because food quality is good, service is good, but pricing isn't the best.  This place is always a pleasure though.  If you haven't been, you probably should soon.",

    "text": "I'm all for authenticity and the like, so going into the Monta Noodle House is something of a nice nostalgia because it reminds me of a ramen shop in Japan; it's small and cozy yet with that \"hole in the wall\" charm.  The entire menu fits on one page, which for those that like variety I would suggest you search somewhere else to cure your soul for that variety of ramen. For entertainment purposes though, my group started out with an order of their gyoza, which was made from scratch, and was very tasty. The texture was a bit crispy-like on the outside, and that's all that it took (I think) to make it that much tastier. The inside had that \"it's hot, but just right\" feel to make it warm up the insides.  Though really now, it's all about the ramen. Monta prepares ramen in a Japanese fashion, the importance on the soup base. I had the tonkatsu (pork) base with extras of corn, egg, nori (seaweed for those who don't know), and some extra tonkatsu. The broth was a little bit saltier than I would have liked it, but all in all it was a very good blend of flavors that would make anybody want to come back for more. (b^^)b  In terms of drinks, you want to avoid pretty much everything on the menu besides water. It's a ramen shop, so you really want to focus more on the awesomeness of ramen, but I'm a bit sad that there isn't hot tea; my group ordered tea thinking it was hot, but it comes in a can that's been sitting in a fridge. Not a big letdown, but on a cold day in Las Vegas (those do exist) it would be nice to have a cup of hot tea to go with the ramen.  Atmosphere wise, everything resembles your typical Japanese ramen shop. The music adds a nice touch, but really it's the small, cramped family-like atmosphere that gives it that ramen shop touch. It's definitely good for those who want to catch up with one another or a small group of people looking for somewhere to eat; that's the atmosphere that was created.  All in all, a very good experience and if you want to eat some good legitimate Japanese style ramen, Monta is the place you want to go. (b^^)b",

    "text": "Finally!  A yelp hyped place I actually really loved.  Just when I was starting to give up on agreeing with my fellow yelpers, this place comes along and surprised me.  Let me note that I have never tried any sort of authentic ramen or have been to any ramen houses before, anywhere.  I know nothing about what is good and what isn't.  I also never come to the Spring Mountain area, as it is nowhere near where I live and my husband is not crazy about Asian cuisine.  So I came here alone before spending a few hours doing volunteer work in North Las Vegas, wanting something in my tummy before doing lifting and stuff.   I've complained in other reviews about some restaurants (mostly Asian-type food) that overwhelm you with egg smells when you walk in.  This one was one of those restaurants, but it was not bad enough to make me turn around and walk out.  It still grosses me out, as I really hate eggs.   I ordered the Tonkatsu, and only added some green onions.  Really nice flavorful broth, and I've never had such tender, nicely cooked pork in my life.  Very very good.  Next time I would add more pork to the dish.  My only beefs about this place was that they didn't brew their own iced green tea, they serve it from a can, meaning no refills.  And, the portion sizes were huge and I couldn't finish it all.  I wish they would serve a smaller bowl.  Oh and veggies!  Ramen needs a little vegetable action, and yes I know it is not authentic but I want it.  Other than that, I'll definitely be dragging my husband here whether he likes it or not.",

    "text": "Yup, I went to Monta again....  This time I had 'Hiyashi Chuka(Cold Noodle)' & 'Small Bowl of Chashu'!  I loved it!! The ponzu sauce for the cold noodle was very citrus and just right. I'm wondering if they are making the homemade ponzu at their place instead of using the sauce from the bottle :) The hint of sesame oil was really blended into the dish and I was happy with the amount of the vegetables that they served with the noodle.   The chashu is a popular topping for the ramen, but I wanted to try with my rice this time. The chashu bowl comes with several piece of fried pork, chopped dried seaweed, and chopped green onion on top of rice. It was sooooo good!  I think I am sometimes very superstitions. Whenever I eat rice, I gobbled every grain in my bowl . My mom taught me to finish all the rice and eventually it will bring a good luck?! I still feel like that little girl :) Anyways, the dish was so tasty that I finished it all.   The server always welcoms customers with big smile :p  By the way, I happened to see the owner of Sushi Mon who was helping the kitchen staffs that day..,and the waitress said it's own by him.. What a great success! :-p",

Their pork ramen broth is killer good, and you can even order extra noodles if you are feeling hungry. They have additional ramen toppings for a little extra as well. The place is small so expect a wait if you come during peak hours. But overall, this place is killer.",

The shoyu tasted like soy sauce in water; I know shoyu means soy sauce, but every other place where I eat shoyu ramen, it didn't actually taste that way.  The tonuskutu-shoyu had at least some richness to it.  The noodles tasted ok, if I only ate the tonuskutu-shoyu, I would of given it 4 stars, but because of the shoyu broth, I am giving it a 3.5.",

You would say its just a hole in the wall place.  they have a very limited menu since the kitchen is so small and thats understandable.   I ordered the Shoyu Ramen, Gyoza and the small Fried Rice.  I was amazed by how delicious it was.  I am japanese so I like a good Ramen from time to time.  The Gyoza (potstickers) was home made.  Trust me I have eaten enough store bought Gyozas to know the difference.  Oh! and the Fried Rice was very tasty as well not mushy like other places.  Each grain of rice perfectly seperated from eachother..   With that being said the only 2 turn offs is the price.  althouggh a lot of the pricing is dead on correct.  there are few items on the menu that i feel is over priced for the amount they give.  another thing is the temperture inside the restaurant.  i guess they dont have any ac so they use a fan to cool down the room.  after eating hot soup i started sweating like a horse.   Overall I am satisfied with the product and i will be going back to eat again... That's for sure...",

I order ramen for me and my wife and gyoza for my son. I even make her repeat our orders. The ramen came pretty quickly, but the gyoza never came. I asked the waitress TWICE, if they're making the gyoza and she said yes, they're coming. 30 minutes later I see two plates of gyoza already done, but she give it to other tables. I asked where's the gyoza, she give me blank stare and she never apologize for her mistake. Seriously how hard can it be, especially with very limited menu, most people either order ramen or gyoza. She's either high or really stupid. I probably would come there agin, but I don't want her to serve us ever again.",

FYI: We have been wanting to try this place for awhile now but its always busy so we never got around to it until last night.

We got the black garlic ramen, tonkotsu ramen, mini chashu bowl, and the mini mentaiko bowl that was shared between two people. All of the dishes were great, especially the black garlic ramen and the chashu bowl .  The black garlic ramen and tonkotsu ramen were great. The broth was hearty and packs a big punch of flavor. It might be too salty for some, but it was salted perfectly for me. The noodles were cooked to my liking and the meat was soft and seasoned well. I personally love garlic and the black garlic ramen was right up my alley. It was packed with garlicky goodness and I drank some of the broth after finishing the noodles just to taste more of it.The mini mentaiko was good, but I wish had a little more fish roe.  The star out of all the dishes is the chashu bowl. The chashu was incredibly flavorful and had nice touch of charred flavor to it to give it a extra kick. The fatty parts of the meat melts in your mouth and coats it with juicy deliciousness. When I return to Monta, I will definitely be getting this again no matter what.   As a side note, be prepared to wait if you do come at a busy time and make sure your entire group is present when they call your name.",

You won't be disappointed. Lucky we came at a time right before they got super busy so we didn't have to wait the place is really tiny so when there is a wait sometimes you might have to wait outside. We walked in and were immediately seated at the bar area. We ordered right away and were given our drinks right away The food came out within 5 or so min very fast. My friends ordered the spicy ramen  and I ordered the pork belly bowl over rice  and then we got an order of the kimchi rice to all share. Everything was amazing the kimchi rice was like nothing iv ever had before it was so delicious it had chunks of Napa kimchi cabbage in it! So good! the spicy ramen was perfect not to spicy and had amazing flavor! And the pork belly bowl was also delicious. I'll be revisiting this place for sure for that kimchi rice!",

What I can say is, we went with a party of 5, and we each order various foods to family style it.  Everything was SUGOI!!!   We ate, stomachs joyful, wallet happy, and vow to be back very soon.  Can't say anymore than that.  Well actually I prolly could, but do I really need to?",

At north we have ichi ramen, and that's hands down my favorite ramen place. The broth over there and the spicy sauce is fantastic. So I came with high expectations for Monta. I'm clearly judging on the ramen broth, and truthfully, I have no idea what people are talking about. The tonkotsu broth has a strong smell that is very off putting. I can't really describe it, maybe it's the pork broth or something, I'm not sure what it is. My friend who recommended Monta told me, it's the broth, that's how Monta Ramen usually smells. I really couldn't finish my ramen because the smell from the broth. The service was okay, and their fried rice was good. My rating is solely based on their ramen because it is their main product. It's really not as good as people describe. I just think people haven't been open to other ramen shops but broth wise. Ichi ramen is way better. Personally, the drive from north and the broth just doesn't do it for me. I swear there is a smell that is offputting. I hope other people can tell me what that is.",

The toppings were too basic. It wasn't a surprise that the flavor was lacking when you only have a few components. You get two small slices of chashu and a few bamboo shoots. The tonkotsu-shoyu broth didn't have any depth of flavor. I had to ask for a second helping of noodles because the serving was so small. I didn't like the thin texture of the noodles. My friend asked for extra chili sauce for his spicy tonkotsu because it lacked the kick he was looking for. They said it was $1 extra. If your broth isn't spicy enough and you want to charge your customers extra, shame on you. Plus, 75 cents for nori? At least that's included at Sora. The best part of the ramen was the soft-boiled egg.",

It will melt in your mouth.  It gets really crowded during lunchtime and the place is pretty small so plan accordingly.  It's priced right under $7 so the price is definitely right.  I'm Korean so I love that they offer a side of kimchee.  It's a must.  They also had a mustard green side which was WAYYYY salty..  I definitely would not order that again.   Monta's legit.

    "text": "So the fiancee and I were next door at Kung Fu Tea, and she said: \"let's not go exactly at 11:30 AM when it opens\".  So 5 minutes later we walked in and man the place was already packed. We got lucky and scored a corner table. A line had quickly formed after. It's a small establishment so be prepared to wait.  But the wait is worth it. Featuring a very easy to read menu (think, Shin-Sen Gumi in Fountain Valley/Gardena/Alhambra), we both ordered a regular bowl each featuring their pork broth.  Aside from the ingredients, which were tasty (the pork can be on the fatty side, which I love, but may vary for others), the broth itself was super rich and very very savory. Quite simply some (if not the) best ramen you can find in Vegas.  The servers take your orders down on iPads and are fast/friendly.  Parking seemed easy given the time we went, and this place does take credit cards. Major kudos to this place and I can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "Don't let the lines sway you this place is worth the wait!  The Tonkotsu Ramen was an eye opening gastronomic experience. After years of ordering various Phos and Miso soups this broth blew every other out of the park. It's ruined us forever. With a creamy consistency that rivals milk or melted butter this stock made from pork bones, fat, and collagen is heaven in a bowl. Add to that some amazing thin noodles (you can order thicker noodles if you desire) and throw in the basic toppings of green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage mushrooms. OMG it was to die for!  There are many additional toppings you can order to customize and make it perfect for your tastes.   We also ordered the Gyoza and the regular fried rice. After reading all the reviews we had to give them a try. The fried rice was good, but not fabulous. Perhaps there's a difference if you order the Takana Fried rice?  The gyoza were great. Thin pillows stuffed with vegatables and pork. Hot and delish!    Lucky for us, we're in town for a couple of weeks so we'll definitely be back!",

Their ramen is hyper-authentic and affordable (under $10), we also had gyoza and fried rice, and they even had vinegar and soy-sauce on the table (which is traditionally mixed together to make the gyoza dipping sauce.)   I love this place! The wait will be super long, because their are only about 20 seats, if that. Prepare to wait, or go early. Either way it is amazing.

    "text": "One of the factors in choosing a hotel when I come to Vegas is its proximity of C-town, where all the comfort foods and pretty decent ramen joints are. We tend to end up at Palms Place, just a couple of miles away.    Most recent trip, we came here for a quick bite. Dinner time on a Tuesday night resembles the weekend. People already waiting outside after signing in on the wait list.   It took about 10 min before we were called. Menus came quickly and our orders were taken just as fast. Fairly simple menu with decent choices.   We had Kuro ramen w black garlic oil. Rich broth w noticeable garlic flavor plus fatty slices of pork. Sprinkled their red pepper and it was delicious. Only $7.95  Also got a tonkatsu ramen. Like the other, this also had a rich broth w even fattier slices of pork than the first one. The red pepper did wonders for this bowl too. $6.95  Extra bowl of noodle to soak up that broth: $1.50.   The food came out super fast. And they came by quickly to clear up the table.  I get it, they need turnover. But they the staff were always nice and never pushy.    Our food was great. Simple and very satisfying. The  service was fast and efficient. We will definitely come back.   Notes:   *The parking lot is a decent size, but it will fill up. Circle around and even look at the side streets.   *The entire party needs to be present before being seated.  * It's a small place. Parties larger than 4 may expect a longer wait. Come in smaller numbers * Toppings are available ranges from nori to pork chashu at various prices.  *Eat quick and leave. They need turnover at these low prices. Go somewhere else to catch up",

We ended up ordering gyozas,  kimchi rice, kuro garlic ramen with extra egg, pork belly rice bowl, and extra pork.   Food:  The quality of the food was amazing.  Great ramen noodles and amazing broth. It is very balanced and not too salty. Loved the garlic tasted behind it. We loved the kimchi rice as well.  The pork belly rice bowl was allright. They could added more pork belly but for the price, it was good. Overall For the price and quality, this is by far the best ramen place in Vegas 5/5  Service and atmosphere:  very fast service. We ordered really quickly. Then  less 15 minutes, our food arrived.  They paid attention to our water level and followed up to see if we want anymore items.  Atmosphere is very small and smelled like ramen broth every where!  It was such a good smell!  5/5  I will definitely come back for more ramen!",

You know those movies where some dude walks into a bar and tells the barkeep \"the usual\"? That's me with Monta. I go in with my 1980 trench coat and hat, smoking a cigarette, sit down at the bar counter. The waitress comes up and I give a deep sigh before saying \"I'll have the usual\". She inputs my order in her iPad before she leaves me to sulk silently about a double homicide that I've been trying to solve for the past 5 years. The chief tells me that the case has gone cold... but I know, I know that the killer is still out there and one day I'll avenge little Suzy and Bobby, god rest their souls.

We were lucky enough to arrive early because otherwise I am not sure if we would have been seated. The place is small and sits very few people.

This place was the clear winner, there were some other places that were good but not quite as good as this place.  Not only do they have excellent Ramen broth and noodles with a perfect balance of flavor with neither side over powering the other. They also had Kimchi fried rice that was \"WOW\" so delicious and their Gyoza's were great. And loved the fact that they have crushed/minced garlic in a container next to our table. I love a lot of garlic in my food. :-)  Been to a bunch of places all over the US and this is one that is closest to real Japanese style Ramen that I have experienced in Japan. So happy Yelp is now being used in Japan.  This place sets the bar really high to compare to the real thing.  Can't wait to go back, my only complaint is that it is so small and you need to go 30 minutes before they open to get in.",

I went thru the whole shopping center and at Monta I had the best feeling- I did not want to check reviews until I sat down. It is a small restaurant that can probably only seat about 25 people. I ordered the kimchi rice with pork belly on top and my girlfriend ordered the Spicy Ramen.   My kimchi rice with pork belly was delicious, the pork belly was soft and almost melted in your mouth. The kimchi rice was not red which thru me off but the flavor was amazing.   The ramen was amazing and so large- half way thru we decided to switch to both try what we each ordered.   We also ordered pot stickers and they were delicious.   For everything it ended up costing up about 26 dollars and it was well worth it. When we arrived (Saturday at 2pm) there was no wait but when I left the hair salon at almost 8pm there was a line wrapped around the door. For the next 24 hours, I craved and wanted Monta. I will be back and am so excited my food guides directed me here.",

With over 2500+ reviews and 4-stars rating, something gotta be good here!   After waited for 30 minutes and finally got to try a variety of ramen... here's the verdict... well, all Tonkotsu, Spicy Tonkotsu and Kuro Black Garlic Oil Ramen turned out to be a bit too salty... although the quality of broth is considered somewhat standard... (NYC standards, of course) with creamy and thick broth... their Chashu is very thin and on the fatty side. Having used to getting lots of toppings as basics in NYC, you'll find that dried seaweed, seasoned egg and bamboo shoots are extras at Monta Ramen. Then again, this is Vegas Chinatown... and so, I say it's overall a good value ramen.",

That was my first sign this meal was going to be enjoyable. The staff greeted us with a smile. Started off with gyoza (pot stickers / dumplings). There was a seared side and a steamed side. Balancing the slight crunch while still remaining tender and moist. The Tonkotsu Ramen had a pork broth base with thin noodles, and slices of pork belly. I heard the pork is the best here so I went ahead and ordered extra pork for mine. The pork belly melts in your mouth. The fat was velvety, which you could only get from a slow cooking process. The portions were ideal. Not so much where I had to take some home but not so little where I would still be hungry. I walked out of there completely satisfied and my wallet was also happy as the process were very reasonable.  (thank you for the delicious food).",

The ramen is affordable and credit cards are accepted for orders over $10. Their specialty ramen dishes will run u just under $8 while their more basic dishes will run you $6-$7. If you're feeling especially hungry place an order for some gyoza (pot stickers), or their fried rice. The pork is soft and thinly sliced, the broth is very flavorful, and the noodles are cooked just the way they should be (in my opinion).  I think it's also important to note, that parking in this shopping center can be ridiculous. It's small and can take quite a bit of circling to find a legitimate parking space.   Ultimately, if you are looking for your new go to ramen joint, this place should definitely be in the running. Don't take my word for it, check it out!",

You have to pay extra for every single thing, and there were several things I would expect that were not offered. Frankly, the flavor was not much better than a cup of noodles from the grocery store.  Except there were mushrooms. Lots and lots of mushrooms. Which would have been nice if they warned me on the menu, since I am allergic.   I don't know why this place is aso popular with the hipsters. It is cramped. It is tiny. It isn't that clean. It plays classic rock and has no particular decorating scheme. Seating is seriously uncomfortable. Parking sucks.  They sat me at the very first itty bitty wooden bar stool right by the kitchen and beverage machine (blowing hot air, adding insult to injury). Every time someone walked by, they hit me in the ass. I couldn't see more action as a pole dancer. Half way through my meal, I gave up.   The place was absolutely stoking hot. If the A.C. is out, warn people. I would have gone to the store, grabbed some Top Ramen, and gone home to add my own cilantro, lime, corn, and spicy seasonings, been cool, and not been groped.  I simply do not get the lines here. If this is what it's all about, perhaps ramen is not for me.",

Although there isn't a lot on the menu, I still come back every time. It is always busy here so be prepared to wait in a small compacted space, as there is only 5 tables and a long bar. I used to think that the ramen here is the same at every ramen place, although after going to places like omoide and then coming back to Monta, I can conclude that Monta is the best ramen place here. The noodles are so flavorful, something you won't get at a place like omoide. Of course omoide as great other food, but for ramen, I highly recommend this place. The meat here is also very fatty (which, in my opinion, is the best part of the meat), thus making the meat something you would want to savor and eat slowly throughout eating the ramen. Typically, I order the tonkatsu which is 6.95, probably the cheapest ramen I've had. Typically I pay for tonkatsu for 7.50. Of course there are other ramen that are around 7.50 but I, being cheap, prefer my usual.",

Ended up being a fun experience! We watched the nice chefs prepare our meals ;)  Don't even try to get a big party in here... I think the largest table fits 6 people?  Parking: good size shared lot  Service: good, quick? Gets a little busy and they might need more servers..  FOOD: come here for the RAMEN, I mean... why would you come to a ramen shop for... fried rice =.= I gotta admit the flavor here is a quite different from all the tonkotsu i've had in LA? But it's a worth-trying difference!  +Tonkotsu ramen (4/5) it was very very RICH , THICK and FLAVORFUL, maybe it's because i'm not Japanese and can't appreciate the ultra richness, it felt a bit over whelming at the end of the bowl. Maybe the tonkotsu-shoyu would be a good texture.  +the flavored egg (5/5) omg, please do add this to your bowl, it is soooooo gooood, im drooling a bit just writing this review. I wish they can just make this part of the bowl instead of an add-on  +pork belly rice bowl (4.5/5) it was really good! moist and flavorful, one of the better pork belly bowls i've had!!! Do order this instead of the fried rice  -why is the \"spicy\" upgrade costs extra?!?!??! RAWR  OVERALL, my bf and I had a solid lunch for a decent price tag.

There was still a line at lunch but it went by pretty quick without the servers rushing the tables. I must say, you have something great here Monta - a rich tonkatsu broth, very light and clean tonkatsu shoyu broth that did not make me feel heavy at all, and fine servers who know how to do their job. Keep up the great work and food - I will visit on my next trip Vegas. Thanks!!!",

I'd say it's on par with with some of the better ramen places in Toronto but definitely not mindblowing. The tonkotsu broth is very creamy and the charsiu is thin but very flavourful and fatty. Definitely not a healthy meal. Also the broth was too salty to drink unfortunately. One more tip: they only take credit card if you spend over $10. I had to order extra charsiu and also 75 cent green onion to reach the $10 mark. Big mistake with the green onion. They put enough green onion on top to fit 4 meals probably. Yikes. A bit overkill.",

One had no pieces of pork and one was missing one piece. We told the waiter this and he did not apologize. The first words out of his mouth were \"are you sure?\". You're in the service industry and this is how you speak to customers...   I also went up to the waiter to let him know how wrong he was that he did not apologize. He cut me off and said \"can I talk first?\". I was literally shocked. How can anyone be so rude. Obviously we didn't leave any tip.    Clearly we wanted to cheat you out of three paper thin slices of pork.",

    "text": "Came to this location with a good friend for the first time. Never really saw this interior of the restaurant on Yelp but damn, it's pretty small if you ask me. I would always hear the hype about this place and how AMAZING the ramen is here. When I arrived, we had to wait 15 minutes, which is tolerable.   Parking can be a problem in this area but we Uber'd here this time so we didn't have to worry about that.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. Starting prices were pretty cheap and there are extra toppings for you to add. I added extra tamago (egg) and extra pork. Long story short. These add ons can definitely add up the costs to your ramen.   We ordered the fried rice also which was really good and the pork belly which comes in small or large. In all honestly, food was good but the BROTH is a different story. The broth is too thick for my liking and it was too creamy that I couldn't even drink all of the broth. I feel like the broth was on the salty side and I asked my friend and he agreed.   Funny thing is, whenever my group of friends crave ramen, we would always separate and go to different ramen joints. Half of them would go to Monta and the other half would go to Ramen Sora. But in all honesty, it depends on the person because we all have our different takes on ramen. Monta, is good but the broth just ruins it for me.",

    "text": "Monta Ramen is a tiny shop sandwiched between  Kung Fu Tea and a sushi restaurant. While I understand the aim to look like an authentic Japanese ramen shop, they really ought to consider how impractical it is to have a large customer base with only a few seats. We waited in the cold outside for about half and hour, and then were able to squeeze our way inside the door to wait for another 20 minutes or so. There is a wait list that fills up very quickly.  I ordered the miso ramen with an egg, and a side of gyoza. The noodles were perfect but I found the miso broth to be incredibly salty and it overpowered everything. The egg was pre-boiled and probably stored in the fridge because it was cold in the middle. That was disappointing, as I paid over $1 extra for it and the yolk wasn't creamy at all. The gyoza were your typical run of the mill dumplings and tasted like they came from a frozen package rather than \"handmade\" as the menu stated.   Overall, this visit to Monta was a total letdown. I've heard such good things- perhaps we caught the cooks on a bad night?",

I got there just before 11:30 when they open and there was already a line waiting. They are fast and efficient however as they seated everyone and started taking orders right away.   Ordering is easy as the menu is relatively simple with 4 types of broth to choose from, a few additional toppings you can get, and a few other dishes such as gyoza and rice dishes. I got the Tonktsu-Shoya ramen and it was superb. Very flavorful broth and the whole thing tasted excellent.",

The ramen is very reasonably priced. $6.95-7.95 not including any add ins (seasoned egg, nori, corn, etc). The pork belly bowl was so good. The meat was tender and very flavorful. I absolutely loved the broth in the ramen. It was rich and not too salty.  The service was really quick. It was a bit warm inside but it's summer in Vegas and they have an open kitchen.

Otherwise, it was a great experience to sit right at the bar in front of the noodle chefs. What is unique with Monta Ramen is that the ramen noodles were a bit thinner that traditional ramen and had texture while eating. Broth was thicker than what I have experienced with ramen soups. The broth was almost like a gravy than soup but extremely tasty. What I discovered was that the locals will take the leftover broth home and purchase an extra side of ramen noodles to go with it. If you ever want to get your pork belly fat fix, the pork belly over rice bowl is a must have. It was well seasoned and the price is very reasonable. The pork belly didn't have any lean parts and basically all fat. If you don't mind that, it's all good.",

I also love that the bar area has a super convenient cubby place to hold your bag while you eat =^.^= (i appreciate the little things).

We already knew that the parking lot is tight and usually pretty crowded, so we parked in the lot across the street, and walked over. The restaurant is also very small, 9 seats at the bar and maybe 6 or so tables.   The menu is simple. Handful of different types of ramen soups, toppings, misc bowls, and appetizers. We ordered some gyoza to start which was good but nothing special.   My mom and I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen with nitamago egg and extra chashu pork. It came out quickly. The broth was a bit too thick for my liking and the noodles too thin. The chashu pork was definitely the highlight of the dish. It really does just melt in your mouth.   My little brother ordered the shoyu ramen which came with thicker noodles that I would've preferred. He said it was good but pretty salty.   Overall we enjoyed our meal but weren't blown away by any means. The two star rating is because later that evening my mom and I both got sick to our stomachs. My brother was fine, so we think it may have had something to do with our tonkotsu soups. I probably would pass on this place in the future or at least on the spicy tonkotsu ramen.",

    "text": "We ordered a Kuro Tonkotsu Ramen w/ Black Garlic Oil, Tonkotsu Ramen, and Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen.   I didn't try the Spicy Tonkotsu myself but I think the Kuro tastes better than the Tonkotsu. The addition of the garlic oil makes a big difference in my opinion. It makes it much more flavorful. The chashu was good but I didn't like the skin around it. The bamboo shoots weren't that good. Kinda bland.   The complaints I'd have is that the soup is actually a little thicker and saltier than I'm used to. Just a little. Also the noodles are on the slightly softer side.   I also tried their nitamago (flavored egg) which I think were very average. I'm very picky with my eggs so these eggs were too hard and cooked for my liking. Also a bit dry because of that.   By the way, be careful with the chopsticks. They don't break very cleanly so just watch out for splinters.   Price was pretty good. 3 bowls of ramen + 1 extra serving of noodle + 1 egg came out to be about $28 + tip.",

Unfortunately waiting outside for a hot soup, on a hot summer evening was NO fun. It smelled like sewer outside the doors.   Service is Usually pretty good here, everyone is nice, but very rushed as they only have  a few tables in the establishment. It's really a place to go for a quick bite, literally.",

And the long wait was just annoying.  I really don't get why this place always has a long ass line.  I drove by here few different times during the day and there was always a line.  My wife and I got here about 20 minutes before it opened and there were already three people waiting in line.  In about another 10 minutes there were about 20 people in line.  This was on a Tuesday.   Ramen wasn't bad, it just wasn't my style.  The tonkotsu broth was too heavy for my taste.  It was so thick, it was almost like eating melted gelatin.  The chashu pieces were super thin and flimsy, and the flavored egg, which was an added option, just tasted like normal hard boiled egg.  Service was friendly but they try to rush you out (politely).  Can't blame them since there's always a line of people waiting outside.   Look at the board by the entrance area for extra menu items which are not in the main menu, such as spicy tonkotsu and kuro (black garlic oil) ramen.  If you live in Vegas, it's worth a try.  If you are from LA or OC like me, skip it.",

There were chunks of salt in the kimchi fried rice that I had to spit out, the gyoza filling was a bit mushy and looked suspiciously pink, and the spicy tonkatsu ramen was very salty. The black garlic oil ramen was very flavorful, almost earthy, but not overpowering like the spicy tonkatsu. The service was great, we got seated fast and food came right up after we ordered.",

Sure enough, I have now been to this place multiple times. I have tried the different ramen. My favorite ramen here is the black garlic tonkatsu ramen. You have the option to order extra noodle, chashu, eggs, and other options if you want. The service here is excellent, I always try to sit at the bar because you can see the chefs prepping the food. This is a small but quaint place so it's good for a date but not for a big party. They do have appetizers too such as gyoza. You can stuff yourself silly here without breaking the bank. I always leave satisfied and I promise that this would be my first place of chose when coming back to Las Vegas. I later learned that other people that I know who are ramen connoisseurs have also visited Monta. You should not hesitate about coming here.",

Prices are extremely reasonable for what you get.  And what you get is a well-crafted, carefully prepared ramen, with a complex broth that you will find nowhere else.  The tonkatsu (pork) soup base is wonderfully complex and rich, and quite frankly some of the best broth I have ever had.  You can tell they took great care in preparing this soup base.  By the way they even pre-warm the soup bowls before putting your ramen bowl together!  Mixed with strips of seaweed and bamboo shoots, and charsiu, this would be great on a cold winter day (or even a hot summer day like I had it).  The noodles were a little different from what I am used to.  They were a little thinner, light, and with a clean finish.  The gyoza was ok.  They definitely use a lot of ginger.  Very light, and not as dense as most others.  If you want a well-crafted bowl of ramen and reasonable prices... this is the place.",

I got seated pretty quickly and ate at the bar.   Service was good and food came out quickly. Each bowl of ramen is $6.95 and comes with chashu already, but you can add more toppings if you want. I ordered the Tonkotsu, substituted the thin noodles for the medium thick wavy noodles and added a seasoned egg and corn. Pork broth was a little thick and salty for my liking, and I wish the chashu pieces were a little thicker but overall a good meal for less than $10.",

I feel like many good/popular ramen places are typically around 12/13 dollars, so to see that a bowl of ramen here was less than 10 dollars and the quality was good was nice. The inside of the restaurant was small & there was a wait, but the service was pretty quick and I was seated around 5 minutes from arriving. The food came pretty quickly as well. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and the broth was delicious & the noodles were very chewy and easy to eat. The slices of meat were a bit thin, and I ended up losing it in my soup a few times since there was so little and it kept breaking apart easily. However, they were very generous with their portion of noodles. For two bowls of ramen and a can of soda, our meal only came up to around $18, so it is very affordable. Definitely coming back here next visit!",

The Spicy Miso Ramen isn't on the menu but since that what I always have, I asked if they were able to make it which they did to perfection.

I can remember mostly the frustration of having to wait to be seated for about 30 minutes for lunch, my wife couldn't believe that we would have to wait (of course) because Yelp put these guys on map let alone because we were on vacation...  I'm glad I take pictures cause I would not remember what we had otherwise.  It makes sense to me that my son and I would get the Tonkotsu Ramen although I cannot remember why they distinguish between straight Tonkotsu Ramen <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=ddOoJ7xxdlzsoK8pVijkOA#1dCDESmprmeorQdpSYAY7w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a> and Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=ddOoJ7xxdlzsoK8pVijkOA#cD3EI0A5-l-MwKjY9VOOzA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>.  I must have ordered extra chasiu signaling the extra fatty pork belly as all of our bowl had some thin slices of  regular pork already.  The eggs we ordered extra look soft and slightly runny.  It also makes sense to me that my wife would be the maverick and order the Shoyu Ramen <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=ddOoJ7xxdlzsoK8pVijkOA#u5oFC1NkLTDnWF5-2nzqPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a> which is a chicken/vegetable based stock.

Upon further review, it seems that the base bowl of noodles wasn't enough as we two porkers (the guys) ordered extra noodles for $1.50 more <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=ddOoJ7xxdlzsoK8pVijkOA#UQ97AvwHN4VveAeyWBmmKA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>.

Noodles and pork were both perfectly cooked.  Normally I try not to drink too much broth because it's so fatty and unhealthy, but the broth was so tasty I drank it all.    The restaurant is small and the line can get long so be prepared to wait if you come in during the lunch or dinner rush.  The service is fast but don't come here if you're expecting to hang out for hours.    Highlights:  Quick service.  Prices are very reasonable.  About $8 to $10 for ramen.  Kuro and Miso ramen are amazing!  Lowlights:   Lines can be long so be prepared to wait during rush hours.  Summary:  This off-the-strip gem is a definitely must eat if you're visiting Vegas.  Go with the Kuro and you will not be disappointed!",

I tried the black garlic oil Kuro ramen and it was hands down the best bowl of ramen I ever had. We also tried the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it had great flavor as well.

We decided to go because it was cold in Vegas anyway so ramen would warm us up!   Ehh I think where I am from, ramen is much better. There was quite a wait, the place was itty bitty! I didn't even end up getting ramen just because I didn't want to bloat and be all big before going out. I went with the Regular Fried Rice. I mean there wasn't anything amazing about it. It was like ordinary rice that I could've whipped up myself!   My gf got the ramen. The broth was okay. I've had better. The noodle on the other hand was super fresh. It had a crisp to it when you bit into it too.   The cool thing about our experience was we sat at the bar so we were able to see the chefs prepare all the ramen bowls and cook the meats and what not. What bothered me the most about this place is its efficiency and service. They are super slow and move like ants here! Nothing is speeding them up and I feel like I waited about 30 minutes for my food on top of the wait before being seated.   Too bad this joint was sort of far from Chinatown...because I wanted to check that place out but it wasn't walking distance!",

Tbis place is still so popular, but the ramen was so bad today. The rame  became less than par, just like the  average ramen places in L.A. I don't think I will come here again. I always go back and forth between their Tonkotsu Shoyu and plain shoyu. I had the Shoyu today.  It tasted like my ramen sat in the soup for a while, almost like take-out ramen. If you cannot get the original shoyu right, you cannot get anything right. I used to love their broth by just smelling it. Their pork chashu looked miaerable, now so thin, dry, and no fat. Where did the Japanese chefs go? Did they just train the locals and go back to Japan? Maybe the busier restaurants get, the harder it is to maintain the original flavor. TRULY SAD. Publicity and overrated reviews messed this place up.",

Tonkatsu ramen was really tasty. The pork melted in your mouth. So good! The fungus gave the ramen a crunchy/texture to it! You always want to have some sort of bamboo in your ramen, which they did! The only thing I thought was missing was the noodles. They served mines with the thin noodles. I preferred to have my ramen with ramen noodles!

The side dishes like gyoza (pot stickers), special fried rice, and kimuhi (Japanese kimchi) are all amazing on their own as well. You can also get delicious Japanese imported draft beer at a great price. I am absolutely addicted to this place. Fun atmosphere, amazing food, and delicious beer. If you've been eating Cup Noodle your whole life... please... please go discover what real ramen was meant to taste like. Monta is where it's at.",

Yeah, I know it's not traditional, but we're from L.A. and my husband is spoiled.  The tonkotsu is fabulous, and pairing with an icy cold Asahi made it even more so.

The fried rice and gyoza are also really good too although sometimes the gyoza comes out stuck together and rip when you pull them apart.

Even after my first time coming here, I'm still craving it all the way from California. The noodles are absolutely cooked to perfection. The broth is, of course, so tasteful and hot, but so good that even in the heat of Las Vegas, you couldn't care about it. The meat is THE best meat I've ever had in ramen, hands down. It's so tender and savory, it just falls apart with ease. The next time you're in North LV, you GOTTA stop by. You'll come out sweating from the heat inside the restaurant mixed with the heat from the soup and the weather, but you'll come out completely satisfied.

The first time I came here was also the first time I had ever had ramen. It was a Thursday afternoon around 3:30-4. I was looking for a good local place with ramen as I was with my family and it was my dads suggestion we try ramen. We went to a place on the same street about 3 blocks down. The place was EMPTY I mean not even a single car in the parking lot. After doing some research on yelp I see that monta ramen is just down the street and was high rated with lots of reviews. We checked it out and it was packed! On a Thursday afternoon that really says a lot about the place especially when another similar place so close was completely empty. We waited a moment for a table to be ready as this place is kinda small and does not have much seating space. But do not be deterred by this! It is worth the wait. The waitress was very nice and recommended the pork/chicken broth combo which she said was the most popular. I was sooooo impressed. I can't describe how delicious. I've gone back twice and it has only been 5 days. Mind you I also do not live close by.",

Okay let be honest, there's only one dish, served three different ways, with a few small sides dishes and add-ons. But boy do they make that one dish well.  The place is usually pretty busy, and there are few seats to choose from. But a chair at the bar provides somewhat of a show as the cooks stack the bowls to warm them in preparation of the noodles which they shake free of their excess water with a particular flare.  You're in and out in no time and if you leave hungry, you probably didn't ask the waitresses for help in making your decision.  On a side note: it's not uncommon to find yourself sitting next to a beautiful and fascinating young woman - just don't blow it.",

    "text": "Its official; I made my quest here today and I'm already craving round 2. It's gooooood!  For those not in the know, I've been a ramen-iac since I was 12 and first learned how to cook myself a cup o' noodles. I spent several summers as a gawky teenager watching cartoons and gobbling noodles like a fiend. Over the years, and through thousands of packets of freeze-dried noodles I slurped onward. Kimchi flavor, Maruchan, Nissan, yam-noodles, dandan mien and instant jjangmyun, my adoration for the comfort of a big steaming bowl of chewy noodles drenched in broth steadily growing. I've tried Ichiza's, Shuseki's and making it myself- this tops the list. Ichiza's was close, but this place will most likely be my number one noodle-spot this winter.   Coming up to the restaurant, I wouldn't have thought it was open if it weren't for the neon sign saying so. There's plenty of parking and it's right across the street from the shopping center with Shuseki.   I sat at the bar as I was having lunch alone and wanted to see the action. One chef would feel out the proper amount of fresh noodles per bowl, roughly a fistful, and drop them into the boiling cauldron of water. On the other side was a large kettle of broth steaming away, ready at a moment's notice. In the background several men worked on various other tasks involving the pork and other side dishes. At the front of the bar was the Vegas Weekly magazine that mentioned them, as well as a Good-luck Kitty, which I thought was cute.  Today, I opted for the miso. At first I couldn't decide- I'd tried the miso flavors at other establishments, so should I continue the trend for consistency of comparison, or deviate and expand my horizons further. I opted for the miso with nitamago, or egg. It didn't take long before my noodles were politely presented to me.  The broth: Super porky. No MSG taste at all. Rich miso flavor-seemed like it was all white [sweet] miso. Great depth of flavor, with an intense, buttery mouth feel. Hit all the right notes and was intensely satisfying. Tastes like homemade.  Noodles: Al dente egg noodles. Chewy and lots of them! Much better than anything instant with great slurpability.   The egg: Beautifully cooked, creamy and custardy, it added an entirely new level of complexity to the broth and had an exceptional texture. Ichiza's eggs are close, but the one I had here was supple and gelatinous, cooked slowly and well. It was easily the best egg I've had in a restaurant this year.   Pork: My bowl came with 2 slices of succulent, fall-apart tender pork. I could pull bite-size pieces off using my chopsticks. Thousands of times better than the terrifying piece of pork we were served at Shuseki. The pieces were thin, but I was satisfied with the amount I was given. You can always order more if you're willing to pay the additional charge.    Extras: The ramen comes with bamboo shoots, a few pieces of mushroom and a mountain of green onion. You can also add minced garlic paste, benishoga [red pickled ginger], sesame oil, furikake mix, sesame seeds, what looked like vinegar & a couple of other options are available either through the menu or asking your server.  I found the portion large enough for a late brunch, tiding me over for hours and powering me through a trip to the dog park with 3 rowdy puppies. I'm extremely satisfied and happy with the meal I had here, and I bragged to several of my friends. I'm looking forward to trying the shoyu flavor next, as well as trying the spicy greens with it.   I'll be back very soon!",

    "text": "Being a pretty lucky teen, I've had the chance to travel, and try many ramen shops around Las Vegas area, California, as well as Japan and Hong Kong. Though it is not up to what I have tried in Japan, it is pretty close.   This is a small ramen shop at the back of a shopping centre. Max occupancy is probably give or take 25-30 people max with option to sit at the bar or table. Staff gives a very friendly welcome upon entry. A lot of times, this restaurant is quite busy. The restaurant has a nice warm feeling (not due to the heat from cooking) but it resembles some ramen shops i have tried and seen in Tokyo, Japan.   Upon sight of the menu, the front cover has a little story of origins of ramen. When you see the selection of foods they provide, it is not much. This is one of the few places, that i really like, that don't offer a wide variety of foods. Not only do they specialize in what they offer, it is also the only thing they need because of how well made it is.   They have three broth selections. Tonkotsu, which is a pork bone based broth (usually slowly boiled and simmered for many hours to create a white flavor-filled broth), Miso, and Shoyu (soy-sauce based). Being a fan of tonkotsu ramen, that was the first broth i had tried and loved. Price range for the different soup is i believe 6.95 - 7.95 with Shoyu and tonkotsu being $6.95 and Miso at 7.95 [don't quote me on the pricing but i do remember the miso being more expensive than tonkotsu for some reason... you'd think the one with more work (tonkotsu) would be more expensive]  They offer a variety of toppings ($1 - $2.50 each) you can choose to add to the ramen as well, ranging from extra pork, green onions, corn, butter, some green vegetable (forgot the name). Hearing great things about their pork, that was what i had ordered as an additional topping. There is also the option of getting extra noodles for a small fee of $2.   Take note, there are two types of noodles they use between the 3 broths. I believe Tonkotsu uses one, while miso and shoyu uses another. They also offer sides like gyoza, pork over rice, etc.   Upon arrival of food, i was amazed how well the ramen looked. The soup had a deep white color, pipping hot freshly made. The soup was not thin but not thick as well. Not sure how to explain, but it was a broth that looked to be filled of flavor. As most people, the first thing to try was the soup. Upon tasting of the soup, I was amazed. The flavor of the soup was rich, extremely flavorful, not too salty or sweet. It was like, perfection was reached. The noodles were a little over al dente which was perfect for ramen. The table has spices that you can add on top of your ramen like chili oil and this spicy spice mix.   The pork they used was a 1/2 fatty 1/2 meat type of cut formed in a circular shape. Being of Asian origin, it was exactly how I liked it. As said before, the option of extra noodles was available so some of the pork was saved. They amount of noodles you get is quite an amount (usually wont expect too much for \"additional noodles\" but if anything, it may have been a slightly larger serving then that was in the original bowl. The additional noodles is given in a bowl, heated and ready to be thrown into your original soup.   Lets just say, every single time, i order a bowl of ramen, additional noodles.. and never have soup left over =]   Service is great. Food is great. Price is reasonable. Recommend to many friends and family. One of the best ramen places i've ever been to",

    "text": "So I went to Monta twice last week due to them adding two new flavors and I had to try them.    Kuro Ramen:  Kuro means \"black\" for all you japanophiles.  The color comes from them adding Ma-yu (not to be confused with ra-yu), which is sesame oil with roasted garlic which gives it garlic flavor while adding blackish color.  To be quite honest, this ramen was not good at all.  I was expecting a punchy garlic flavor which it had very little of, and the broth....damn....what happened?  It was bland.  It taste as bland as Ramen Shoku's tonkotsu.  I had to believe that they were using a different broth for this ramen as I tasted my daughter's tonkotsu and it was totally different.  I would give it 2 stars.  Pretty crappy ramen if you ask me.  I would NOT recommend it.    Spicy Tokotsu Ramen:  This is somewhat similar to spicy miso at Ramen Sora in a way tha they just add spicy miso which you can mix to give it a little kick.  The base Tokotsu ramen is identical and I enjoyed the extra spicy kick to the regular rich tonkotsu broth.  It was also moderately spicy (for me), and I liked the fact that the spicy miso was viscous enough that I could adjust the amount of kick I wanted as I didn't want ALL of it.  I would give it solid 4+ stars for it.    With all that Monta has done to Las Vegas' ramen scene, I would still give them a 4, even though their new Kuro ramen was a complete failure.    I'm also finding that ramen chefs of recent has become noticeably hispanic, and ramen noodles seem to be a bit overcooked for my taste.  If I see that the noodle isn't as firm as I like it next time, I will drop them down to 3 stars....watch out Monta...there are some real competitions now.",

    "text": "Monta Ramen: The 411 and maybe something different than the 559 other Monta reviews...  Location: 1 block West of Decatur on Spring Mountain Road. It's tucked into the back of a small shopping center off the North side of Spring Mountain. Signage is minimal which means if you're not paying attention you will miss it.    Parking: Limited parking spaces if other businesses nearby are open. Can be tight to park if crowded.   Monta is small. Square footage wise they've taken a small space and maximized every square foot of it. Don't be surprised if there's a wait that you have to stand outside as there's room for maybe 2-3 people inside the front door.   Seating. They have a handful of tables and a counter with slightly uncomfortable stools you can sit on that looks into a fun to watch kitchen. If you are shy, claustrophobic, or don't like slurping noodles where anyone can watch this is not the place for you.   Food: I walked in here skeptical. 559 Yelp reviews. Lots of heated discussions, controversy abounds about Monta. I came to try it, and I came in a bad mood to boot. I ordered Miso Ramen with extra slices of charziu. And I had an OMG moment here that left me with a smile from ear to ear and I left the bowl totally empty. I will say that Ramen Sora has better charziu, hands down. But the overall experience I had at Monta was superior in every other aspect.    Special Notes: Monta's Miso Ramen has a bit more oil in the broth. It's not an oil that ruins the taste, it seems to enhance it somewhat. But it's also a small problem if you're sitting at the counter slurping a bowl of ramen and you get some splash back that lands on your shirt. If you've got to go back to work after eating at the counter, having some Shout wipes on hand is essential.   Overall Impression? I loved it. From the wide range of people I ate lunch beside to the overall awesomeness of the Miso Ramen to the friendly and fast staff, count me among those who understand why Monta inspires such a range of emotion. For me, this was an experience I won't soon forget, and I can't wait to go back and have more of it.",

    "text": "Before I departed to Japan for a month, I was given an impromptu send-off party at Monta.  This came following a year of nonstop coworkers cheering about how wonderful Monta was and how it made other establishments in Vegas, particular Anime Ramen, look bad.  So needless to say, my expectations were really high.    It should be mentioned that Monta was incredibly authentic to the point where everything that I loved and hated about Japan was en-capsuled by this establishment:  Too small to fit a decent crowd so there was a 45 minute wait late night on a Friday?  Check. Hard benches? Check. Tiny waiting space? Check. Completely open mail slot in the middle of December with a door that didn't close so it was incredibly drafty and wet and miserable?   Check.  At some point I was actually convinced that this was their plot: Make you so hungry and cold and put-out that you would just find the food euphoric when you finally arrived.  Not to mention that they were OUT of miso so anything that had miso in it was not an option.  Seriously, my favorite thing on the menu?  You're out of it??  So finally managed to get to our food and the taste was great.  Broth was wonderful, noodles perfectly cooked.  Was it worth the wait?  Not reallyI just wanted to flee to Curry Zen whose attitude is blah but food is a staple for me.     I suppose that if I came a weekday afternoon and had a casual bowl I would had a different experience then it would have been fine.  But I shouldn't have to wait for a chance time to have a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure the first thing you hear when you walk in are the waitresses yelling the order in Japanese and the chefs in the back confirming AND the slurping of noodles from patrons which is a strong first impression. (* + 1) I'm no ramen expert but I believe the best places have distinctive flavors for their broths. At Monta, you can definitely tell the Miso from the Tonkatsu, and the Shoyu from the Tonkatsu-Shoyu which earns a star. ( * + 1)   Location+Atmosphere: It's tucked away in a shady strip mall which I always seem to pass, but a good landmark is the bar at the beginning of the mall called Kilroy's (named after the famous Kilroy graffiti). I love the atmosphere which is an open kitchen where you see the chefs work. The bar seating has nice spinning bar stools and it's easy to get comfy/friendly with the strangers next to you. (* + 1)  Service: At the door they don't really care who you are or what you do (whether you have a party of one or a party of 10, no special treatment; no forgiveness for leaving/having incomplete party). Once seated, the service is quick and they get your stuff out as soon as possible to get another butt in your chair. With a small party (2-3) the wait shouldn't be too long. With a large (+4) party, at munch-time you're out of luck. Service does not earn a star.  Food: Ramen (why would you get anything else here?). Four different broths to choose from with their own noodle style. Tonkatsu shoyu ramen comes with wavy noodles and the Miso came with thin noodles. Extra noodles are $1.25. I don't get add-ons because there's no need, the amounts which are portioned should be rich enough to keep you from wanting for a couple hours. Which leads me to portion size. First time it came, I thought I could eat 3 bowls, but after the first tasty, rich bowl you find yourself satisfied. What you're looking for is the flavor of the broth and I think this place has one of the tastiest broths. I like to add the spicy powder, hot oil, and sesame seeds so maybe that's why it gets salty near the bottom, but it makes my noodles tastier. (* + 1) Got the gyoza, tasted the gyoza, enjoyed the gyoza, did not write home about the gyoza.  Strangest thing: I do not understand why they don't serve hot tea. Too much work to serve and too little space for the cups? They do have canned oolong and green tea though.",

Added in the nitamago, hard boiled egg, which made the ramen that much more tasty! As other Yelpers mentioned, they use skinny noodles here...so less substance to chew on. The chashu was tender, although it was on the fattier side.  The hard boiled egg was probably the highlight of the meal, cooked medium.  ~$15/person after tax and tip for lunch.",

Actually, the reason why I even decided to check this place out is because the day before I was at the Japanese Curry spot just a couple hundred feet away (in the same plaza) and noticed a long line at Monta Ramen. I was curious. Why were so many people waiting outside to eat ramen? Well, I needed to found out! So the very next day, my friend and I arrived around 11:15am (the place opens at 11:30am for lunch). There were already a few people in line waiting for the doors to open. I peeked inside. It's very small! There's only about 6 tables and a few seats at the bar. We got seated at 11:30am and when I looked out the window, there was already a line.   We ordered their top two special daily ramens: Spicy Tonkatsu and Black garlic Oil Kuro ramen. Both are fantastic! Very flavorful and unique! I've never tasted anything like the Kuro ramen before. Truthfully it looks gross cuz it's black and oil, but damn the ramen tastes soooo ono (good)!!!! The noodles are perfectly cooked, al dente! The service is fast and friendly (they kind of want you out of there quick, though! lol).   If you're ever in Vegas and you love ramen, you def have to check out Monta Ramen. You won't regret it! The long line is worth the wait.",

I always want to try other ramen joints but I somehow always end up at Monta LOL There can be a long wait if you come during rush hour but it's definitely worth it! The reason why it can take a while to be seated is because the restaurant is small, with only a couple seats and bar seating. I usually get the spicy tonkotsu and it never disappoints my taste buds. Sometimes I add corn, egg or extra chasiu.. depending on how hungry I am. YUM! You can also also share a bowl and just add extra noodles. Each bowl is about $7.50(???) depending on which one you get and how many add ons you get! Not bad for the quality of food you get. MMM RAMEN!!",

So I'm definitely picky (in everything). We waited about an hour, it's a small shop. Our waiter was very nice and our food didn't take long. But oh my, my mouth is watering just typing this. The fried rice was flavorful and oishii! I didn't try the kimichi fried rice I was scared it would be too spicy for me but I'll try it next time because it looked so good at other tables. The gyoza was soft boiled it was yummy too. Now the ramen, I've never had thin noodles before and it changed my world. It really complimented eveything. The broth was hearty but not super so I was able to finish everything. The egg was melting, oozing, you know good stuff. Chashu mmmmmmh. Yeah so go try it out, worth the wait, drive, everything :)",

Also this place is the cheapest I have seen/been to in my entire life starting at $7! So basically this place is cheap and delicious! The tonkatsu soup that i ordered was just as good or even better than the top ramen places I had been to but cheaper! Their tonkatsu broth is rich, thick and milky type but with just a tad salty than I would like. I actually substituted the thin noodles that normally comes with the tonkatsu choice with thick noodles. The noodles were cooked perfectly- chewy. Please note that the price of the ramen does not include an egg; just two slices of pork, scallions, bamboo shoots, and kikurage (wood ear). Service was friendly, attentive & the ramen came out quickly. I would definitely come back to Monta every time I am in the mood for ramen in LV.",

The price is reasonably cheap (compared to IPPUDO in New York City, where we would most likely spend at least $100+) I ordered the Miso Ramen, with egg. It was a bit salty, but overall it was yummy and tasty.   We got there around 5:30, so there was no waiting. The place is really small, so seating is very limited.

Piping hot with a nice flavorful broth! since it was all hot and humid outside, i wanted to take it down a notch with the richness of the broth, so i ordered my ramen with \"less sodium/lighter broth\" and it was still very delicious. it was also a nice change from the regular thick broth that my ramen usually comes in.   the place is pretty small but i dont think a whole lot of people know about it, especially visitors to vegas. definitely stop by when you're in the area if you want a good meal!",

When my order came there was an obscene amount of black garlic oil resembling black sesame paste. This definitely did not look like the picture as advertised. The picture definitely did not have this much black garlic oil in the bowl.  In my bowl the tonkatsu broth was hiding under a layer of black oil. I was puzzled at why there was an excessive amount of garlic oil but I figured I should try it before I say anything else. Once I tried a spoonful of soup I wasn't sure what to think. To me the black garlic oil overwhelmed the tonkatsu flavor and was also quite salty. All I could taste was the garlic oil. Upon finishing my bowl I started feeling quite parched from the saltiness of the broth. Maybe I just went on an off day? If you do order the black garlic oil ramen proceed with caution as it may not turn out like the nice picture as advertised.",

I would definitely go here weekly if I lived close by. Prices are good too.   The space is a bit small and we did have a little wait before we were seated. This place gets busy! Don't worry though, because it's worth it!  I also heard that the Shoyo Ramen is very good as well!  I rarely give 5's. And the funny thing is that I had to get dragged to go here. Go figure.

I have taken detours from cross country driving just to come here.  To me it is worth losing a day of travel time just to enjoy their food.  Recently my Dentist informed me that he had a 3 day conference in LV so I directed him to Monta.  When he came back he told me it was so good that he ate there 6 times in 3 days which means he had lunch and dinner there for 3 days in a row.  If that isn't proof of how totally awesome Monta is then nothing is.  For me it is as good as any I have had the pleasure of enjoying though I do personally consider it the best.  I have nothing against the Ramen in Japan as that is considered the mecca of ramen but Monta seems to have come from a back alley of Tokyo and shines much brighter.  At this very moment I am craving a bowl but just cannot run to Vegas right now but I would if I could because it is that good.",

I liked that they created a warm and friendly atmosphere.  The level of customer service is definitely high at Monta Ramen.  The wait staff is well trained and are very alert to what is taking place around the restaurant.  Unfortunately, the ramen is not up to par.  Instead of a slightly thicker and more al dente bowl of noodles, my was softer and more closely resembled the thinner egg noodles one might find in Cantonese soup noodle entrees. The noodles lacked \"bite\" and did not create much of the \"slurping factor\".  It is really too bad because the broth was decent.  The pork belly was good and the other ingredients were good.

I was going to rate Monta Ramen 2 stars, but the excellent service saved it from going to 2 stars.",

There are only about I think 5 tables and some seats around the ramen bar in the shop. Just our luck, by the time we got to the front of the door, all of the tables and seats were filled. We then had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, we ordered and our food and drinks came out quickly. There are two waitresses- both mid-age Japanese women.  I had the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen with kimchi, nitamago (flavored egg), and nori on the side. The broth was really good- not too salty, so that's a plus. The noodles are handmade as well.

The pricing seemed fair but the bowl sizes were a bit smaller than I was use to, but whatever, because when it came out it, the broth was still delicious to me.   Like many other ramen places, the menu is simple, they have pictures and which broth you would like, I went with the miso and added an egg, it didn't take long to get here and it tasted great.",

Now I pay attention to the details that transform simple ingredients into a satisfying bowl of ramen.   I like Monta's version of soy sauce based ramen better than their tonkotsu.    The tonkotsu is definitely rich compared to other ramens I've had. The flavor of the bamboo and mushroom distracts me from the pork flavor.  Thin and firm noodles come with the tonkotsu and that is the way I would have done it.   The shoyu soy sauce ramen is great and the pairing with a thicker noodle is a good choice because it carries the favors of the broth better.  The flavor balance is right on.  I make this my preferred ramen when I visit.   Pork rice bowl was ok...a little too much fat and not enough flavor. Also it's sliced too thin to get a good grub-on.   Prices and toppings are very good.",

And I am SO glad that we did! They have the best ramen that I have had so far (in life). Oh my goodness!  So the restaurant itself would be best described as cozy... I wouldn't come strolling in 10+ people deep. Most of the seating appears to be surrounding the kitchen in a bar-like fashion. The menu is pretty basic and to the point - easy enough to order. You have a selection of noodles/ramen dishes to choose from... then you can add extras like egg, nori, etc. The basic ramen dishes are pretty filling themselves....but I added egg and nori for more flavor. Oh. My. God. It's like a flavor explosion. Maybe I'm not experienced enough in the ramen world.... but view become a bit obsessed trying it everywhere I go... and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that this is the best ramen I've had (so far).

    "text": "This was definitely a GREAT find!  If you like soup noodles, soups that takes hours to make, or melt in your mouth pork belly...then this is a must try.   This place is very small with minimum seating area and a limited menu.  Their main focus is their ramen and pork belly bowl, so if you do decide to make the trip out from the Strip of Las Vegas (about a 10 min taxi ride), then you have to try their Ramen and Pork Belly Bowl.  Tip:  Anticipate a wait due to the limited seating area.  Fortunately, we were in luck...no wait!  SCORE!!!  The prices here are very reasonable for the portion and the flavor you receive.  You are definitely getting your money worth.  We ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and a small Pork Belly Bowl.  The Pork Belly Bowl was a small size, but it was plenty for us since we totally devoured ourselves with tons of fantastic food on our trip to Vegas.  The bowl was pretty when it arrived!  The bowl was decorated with pickled ginger to cut the fattiness of the pork belly and an abundant amount of scallions to give the bowl a fresh green flavor.  Below the green and the red, was a pile of juicy, tender, and fatty pork belly gleaming at you.   Then our star...Tonkotsu Ramen.  We added extra Chashu Pork, corn, butter, and EGG (this is a definite MUST add...super soft and melt in your mouth!) to our bowl of ramen.  I have to say, this was a delight to the eye.  The portion was a good size, about the equivalent of a large bowl of Pho.  The flavor of the soup was deep and meaty, the noodles had a good bite to it and every bite had the yummy soup flavoring (we saw them cook the noodles in the slow cooked broth), the pork was drool worthy, the crisp sweet corn added an additional tastiness to the bowl, and the black fungus and bamboos added earthiness.  Overall a delicious experience...simple yet still makes us think about it all the time.  Of course not as good as the ramen you can get in Japan, but definitely pretty good for USA.  We would rate this place a 7 for flavor, price, and quality of ingredients.",

Monta Ramen definitely hit the spot!  BE WARNED: They're a bit inconsistent with their soup unfortunately. The first few times were delicious, but the last two times we have gone it was wayy too salty! I could feel the salt burning the back of my throat.",

    "text": "I still think Monta is tasty, but it's just not as tasty as I used to think it was.  While Monta isn't my first choice anymore, I don't have any qualms on eating here. My best friend Tida C. is still a die-hard Monta lover so I'm sure they'll still be in my regular rotation of restaurants.  The Miso broth isn't as rich and a little more salty than I remembered. And the flavors are more subtle than comparable broths I've had at other ramen places. Between Shoyu, Tonkatsu, and Miso, I consider Miso to be the tastiest of all of them.  A couple of the reasons I still think Monta is awesome is their Togarashi (the red chili/pepper flakes on the table). I don't know how they make it or where they get it from, but no other togarashi is equal to that of Monta's. The blend of chili and other seasonings make it incredibly addicting and it has more spice (heat level) than others I've tried.  And of course, they still hold True to carrying the freshest mentaiko in town. That mini mentaiko bowl is still my favorite app / side dish to a hot bowl of noodles.",

However, we were shocked that they had extremely limited options for our vegetarian friend. She ended up paying too much for a small portion of fried rice, for which they would not substitute the pork (expensive) for a side of corn (dirt cheap). This is a small place, not good for groups larger than 4. I wasn't blown away by the meal or experience.",

    "text": "Monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in Las Vegas. Its in the same strip mall as Raku on Decatur/ Spring Mtn.   Monta reminds us of Japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. It's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. The restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.  The menu is simple. Miso, Tonkatsu, or Shoyu ramen. My favorite is...all of them. Huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  I seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. They give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, green onions, half boiled egg, and kikurage. Its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.  Another favorite is their pork belly bowl. Its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. You get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. Its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. We always get a small bowl and share it.  Their gyoza is good as is the kim chee fried rice. We need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that Monta is known for.  Its easy to over order food at Monta. Because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share.   Monta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!!   Arooha!!!!!",

I also order the fried rice.... holy mother of monkey balls.... it was so good I didn't know someone can cook fried rice to this level... this place is incredible.

Seems to be a popular spot with the locals.  When we arrived there was a short wait (under 10 mins) and were seated at the bar once it opened up.  The service was friendly and efficient.  It was enjoyable to watch the action of kitchen right up close.  Everyone was moving with a sense of urgency and I appreciated the effort.  Ramen was definitely tasty but overall experience and ambiance is what pushed up to a 5 star experience.",

The atmosphere reminds me alot of Japan as the entire staff speaks Japanese and the style of the place is tables and bar seating while you watch them prepare your dishes fresh. The ingredients are amazing and they have tons of selections - I always choose more vegetables and an extra egg. We usually buy 2 or 3 rounds of their draft beer. Especially because it's so cheap like a $2 for a pint.   The live atmosphere, delicious aroma and fast  service makes the experience feel truly authentic. Theres always a wait her to be sure to check in and sign your party up. The place is small and has limited seating so parties of 6 or less is advised. I usually get my ramen extra spicy and add the garlic oil. Dig in and try something new if it's your first second or 100th time you wont regret it!! Great for friends and small social gatherings.",

Hot or cold we always swing by, this place if nothing changes with their food will always be my favorite Ramen spot. The inside may be small and yes there can be a line at times but it is well worth the wait.   Tonkotsu - The broth reminds me of a silky smooth savory with soy bean after taste that is truly rememberable. Not to mention the pork is juicy as always and does not lack flavor.   Kuro Ramen - I chose to try this ramen because it seemed unique to me being brought out to other customers with how black the broth was. I forgot to snap a photo but the Kuro is my favorite cause of its rich flavor and with added shredded green onion complimented the broth very well.   Fried rice - Our littles ones love the rice here and so do I, it's probably the best fried rice I've ever had lol no joke. Idk what they do to it but it is ridiculously delicious.   Of course we will be back to eat two or more bowls of ramen in one sitting!!",

The prices here for a bowl of Ramen is cheap compared to previous Ramen joints we've had. No complaints here! The restaurant itself reminds me of a True Ramen shop. You see the chefs preparing the Ramen right in front of you! This place is small and can get really packed during lunch time, so be prepared to wait. We got lucky and were seated within 5 minutes.  The wife and I shared the Kuro Ramen Black Garlic Oil ($7.95), the small Pork Belly Bowl ($3.95), and the small Chashu Bowl ($3.95). The broth for the Kuro Ramen was perfect. Very savory, garlicky, and not too salty. I love me some black garlic oil! The noodles were perfectly cooked. Perfect texture and absorbed the flavor of the broth like a sponge. The pork belly melts in your mouth and everything just pairs well together. The Chashu Bowl was basically the same pork belly they put in your Ramen, but on a bed of white rice. The pork was super tender and perfectly seasoned. The Pork Belly Bowl tasted like \"Thit Kho\" or \"Thom Kem\". Basically it's a lightly caramelized pork belly served over a bed of white rice. Pretty solid.  Overall, this place gets 5 stars from me because of the friendly staff, excellent service provided, atmosphere, cheap prices, and quality of the food! I will definitely be back whenever I'm in Vegas. This place is legit.",

Service - extremely efficient, need to remind everyone that at a ramen bar...in and out, skip the chat outside or next door in the tea bar.  Food - so far one of the best ramen shops in Las Vegas. Noodles have the right texture. Broth has full of body and flavor.",

    "text": "Really great place in Vegas Chinatown, has an easily accessible parking lot and is in a plaza with other Asian food (boba next door!). Came here for lunch today before going to Life is Beautiful. It's a pretty small restaurant (just a few tables and the bar area), so the wait can be intense if you're going at a busy hour. We came around 12:30pm and waited maybe around 30 mins before being seated (our party of 5).   It's pretty cramped inside, but good ramen vibes all around. I know it says one dollar sign on yelp (the prices are actually very reasonable) but just know that you'll probably add toppings to your base ramen (if you don't add anything, the ramen is like $7-8, which is super cheap) so most likely your bill we be more than $10 (but again, still super cheap and totally worth).  I got the shoyu ramen with medium thickness noodles and added seaweed and egg. Pretty good! I don't have anything to complain about, and I tried my friend's thinner noodles and those were pretty good as well. The service was pretty prompt, they checked in often to keep our waters filled (this is something I comment on a lot in my reviews because I'm just a thirsty person, what can I say).  You can also decide to add more noodles halfway through your meal if you choose to. Overall, I can't really think of anything that I didn't like about this place besides the crowded setup of the interior. Solid ramen!",

    "text": "If you are looking for ramen, this restaurant is worth a Uber trip off the Vegas strip. The food is delicious, reasonable priced and the service is great!  My three friends and I came here this summer in search of some yummy noodles. The shopping center that it's located within has a variety of Asian restaurants and dessert places. There's also an excellent foot massage parlor here too. Monta Ramen has a pretty small restaurant space. There's maybe only a handful of tables located within. We got here a little after 5 pm so we were able to get a table instantly. I noticed a line out the door as the evening progressed.   Our table got a mix of the regular/spicy tonkotsu pork ramen. The broth has a nice fatty meat flavor and the char-su was thinly cut and tender. The ramen costs a tad under ten dollars but I thought the portion size is a bit small. If you got a big hearty appetite, I recommend you order extra ramen and meat and your bill will still be under $15 before tax.   I think this might be the best ramen place in Las Vegas and several Lyft drivers and other locals agree with me on this. Be sure to make this a stop in your next visit to Sin City!",

Their reputation in the neighborhood can be told by the locals that you see dining at this place. Limited seating so there is going to be a waiting list, so be prepared.  My biggest surprise is how efficient the crew are. Including he cooks behind the bar. These guys crank out orders within 10minutes of us ordering. Of course, the flavor is great but definitely the crew and customer service is what invites me back to go again.   Menu selection is pretty small and if you read my previous reviews is a good thing because they focus on perfecting their craft. Keep it simple.   Two thumbs up!",

It's really rich however, so adding extra green onion breaks up the richness in each bite and gives you a nice kick of raw onions. The chashu is on the thin side but cooked well and isn't chewy like many other places. The miso broth is also flavorful. Having a bowl on mentaiko don with ramen is always a perfect ending.",

So expect long waiting periods. (pro tip: theres a boba spot next door make sure you get some if the wait is long!) Parking is abundant at times ive been there.   Once your'e seated youre food is pumped out quicker than   The broth is on another level here! So complex! a wonderful thick and hearty soup filled with all the love you can actually taste it!! Very smoke and really darn good! The broth is my favorite part of the bowl!  Noodles are amazing not as chewey as others Ive had before, thin and super yummmeh. Free Garlic and Ginger! FML give me 5 scoops of GARLIC PLEASE. ( im a garlic you know what! ha! )  Add an egg! ad some corn! some more broth! the list can go on!   Best thing about this place is that the menu is very original not a lot of extra stuff you would see at modern ramen joints. Very simple and thats why I appreciate this place! Fried rice, RAMEN, Gyoza (you have to order two) PORK BELLY RICE BOWL is so satisfying I wish I had another stomach for another bowl! Its that good. White rice topped with scallions, pickled ginger, pork belly! its a marriage in your mouth I promise you will not be let down!   Before I end this on the best note possible, their pricing is by far the most \"BANG FOR YOUR BUCK\" meal in Vegas and tops all of the noodle soups ive payed for anywhere else. I mean come on now, a monstrous ramen bowl made from love all under $8 bucks???? HELLO WAKE UP AND SMELL THE BROTH! Its amazing, I mean it. Thank you Monta, Love you all!",

    "text": "For the sake of keeping things interesting (and different), I usually try to avoid writing about the same things in consecutive reviews.  Yet, despite having just written about Momofuku's ramen at Cosmo, it seemed apt to write about Monta Ramen next!  After all, I did end up visiting them for consecutive meals, so why not keep that going?  Not to mention the fact that my perpetual writer's block is getting in the way of me completing my other Vegas reviews...ugh.  Now, to be honest, us coming here was mostly a product of chance (like my luck at the tables...) - we were originally hoping to check out Raku next door, but Monta ended up calling our name first.  Still, this wasn't the worst consolation prize, as my friend had highly recommended this place.  Plus, the menu, while seemingly narrow, offered a lot of enticing choices - seven types of ramen, with a variety of toppings to add, and a slate of some tasty looking specials.  -- GYOZA - Handmade Pan-fried Pork and Vegetable Dumplings (6 pcs)...$5.15 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=IWig51V9qVS5wPimwunFYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>) Although the taste of them couldn't match their appearance (they looked great!), these gyoza were still pretty solid.  The skins had just the right thickness and the filling, while not super juicy, were still rather meaty.  -- PORK BELLY BOWL - Slices of Soy Marinated Pork Belly Served Over Rice with Green Onions...$3.95 (small) (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=N7SWT2MhfVm3l85uB974_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>) Though not as amazing as I had hoped for, this was still pretty solid.  The pork was a little dry (more sauce would've helped), but I liked the flavors/marinade and how the ginger and green onions complemented the pork belly.  Plus, it was a sizable portion for the money!  -- KURO RAMEN BLACK GARLIC OIL - Tonkotsu (Pork) Broth, Roasted Garlic Flavor, Thin Noodles, Two Slices of Chashu, Black Kikurage Mushrooms, Bamboo Shoots, Green Onions...$7.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=r21wntoHDZj4fUR7vhgu-w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>) Very...okay.  Plus points for not skimping on the garlic oil, but the rest of this underwhelmed.  While the chashu was fine, the noodles were kind of \"meh\" and the broth didn't stand out, other than the garlic oil.  What's worse, their Nitamago/\"flavored\" egg (+$1.50) was just a regular egg.  Even though the food may not have been worth the wait time (took about 45 mins to an hour to get a table?), the rest of our experience actually wasn't too shabby.  Service is both friendly and prompt and I really liked how relaxing the vibe was.  The best thing about Monta Ramen, though?  Their prices!  Maybe I'm just jaded by the Bay Area, but you get an impressively large bang for your buck here (like the pork belly bowl!).  Despite how good of a value Monta Ramen may be, I can't say I'd make the effort to come back when there are so many alternatives out there (both ramen and otherwise).  Certainly not a bad spot, but if I'm going to have to endure that sort of wait, I'd rather it be for something new and/or better.",

Aside from that, the tonkotsu that was served wasn't too thin or too fat. It was literally the perfect size and perfect amount of fat. The texture of the noodle is pretty awesome too! It's not soggy nor is it hard. Perfect.  The service was pretty good, I mean--I would say it's normal. But I do have to say that this is a great place to come grab a bite for cheap eats and such.

I have been coming here for years, its just been a while since I have returned. Many of my family and friends from out of town  always want to come here when they visit Vegas.  Their hours are Sunday-Thursday 11:30am to 11pm. Friday-Saturday 11:30am-1am. The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because there is always a wait to be seated, anywhere from 20mins and longer. I know its not their fault, people come because the food is bomb.  Their pork belly bowl is to die for! It just melts in your mouth. The texture of their ramen noodles are good, not too soft/hard. I tried the cold noodles for the first time today and it is super refreshing. Prices are cheap and I always leave happy n full!  The restaurant is small, holds about 30 people. There are 3 girls that run this place. Saori does such a good job with seating customers, taking/delivering orders, and making sure your your drinks are always refilled. Parking in this plaza sucks.",

The wait was about 45 mintues but that didnt bother me since it was Vegas afterall.  The service was wonderful. The waiters were kind and made sure my water cup was always filled. Food came out after 5 minutes of ordering. Very hole in the wall feel.  I got the kuro ramen black garlic oil. Ive never had kuro ramen so i was excited to try this.  The both tasted flavorful, the noodles were the perfect texture, and the pork was nice and tender.  Best of all, it was only $8 for a filling meal. Keep in mind it does cost extra to add corn, seaweed, or eggs. I just didnt feel the need to.  Will definately try the tonkatsu when im back in Las Vegas.",

Service: We were greeted right away and seated at one of the few tables that were open. (You can sit at a table or at the bar) They knew this was our first time there so our waiter went over the menu with us and provided recommendations. (Thank U)  Food: I ordered the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen and added the egg and corn. You can get the spice sauce on the side so you can keep adding spice to your liking. I also added a few sesame seeds which is just one of the options of fixins available right at your table. The broth was full of flavor. So good! If you want extra noodles you can get a side. I didn't need it.   We also ordered the Kimchee fried rice. I've had spicier Kimchee fried rice but it was still tasty.   We also ordered a small bowl of the pork belly which could be a great meal on its own. Yum!  Overall think this was a good choice and will definitely be adding this place as one of our new go to spots!",

Visiters - go try their ramen if you love that noodle soup!! They have rather simple menu and selections - ramen, cold ramen (hiyashi chuka), & rice (fried kimchi rice, pork fried rice, mini mentaiko rice, chashu rice), They can pretty much customize your bowl (if you choose to). Soups they offer are; shoyu, tonkotsu, tonkotsu/shoyu, & miso.  Add the spicy paste to any soup base, pick the noodle (thin, thick, extra curly), & toppings. Spicy miso ramen was what I had! That first sip of the broth took my blues awat after a long sad losing day at the casino!! ;-)  Wait maybe long because this is a small ramen place. Definitely worth the drive out!",

Try to drink the soup and eat the noodles at the same time, and also add a piece of Tonkatsu, they will take you into another level! The Tonkatsu will literally melted in your mouth!  Don't forget to order a pork belly bowl, if you can't stop yourself to order more.  It's so hard for me to write the review without eating the ramen right now!!

My black garlic was heavy, first taste it reminiscing a familiar taste which took me awhile to figure out as abundance of sesame oil favors.  It was delicious.

If this place were relocated to Little Tokyo in DTLA, Sawtelle Blvd. or Gardena/Torrance, I doubt it would even make the mid-tier.  Hits: * Mildly impressed by the Tonkotsu ramen -- the broth was greasy and creamy, but not completely full-bodied... definitely not worth the half hour wait and hype * Ramen is cheap (~$7), since the portion sizes are small -- if you're still craving more noodles, add another serving for $1.50 * Order the overpriced hot green tea ($3) and you'll be amazed that the aluminum can is still hot... Apparently the Japanese vending machine keeps the can warm * The servers are good about splitting the check, and you can pay with card  Lessons Learned: * Why are all ramen restaurants so tiny?? This place can seat 20 at a time, and does not easily accommodate to parties larger than 4 (my party of 6 barely fit at the bar counter) * Prepare to wait -- we waited half an hour coming here at 5p on a Monday night * While the waitress was nice, she seemed really distracted -- In between taking my friend's order, she rushed into the kitchen and then came back 5 minutes later to resume taking down his order... weird * The ajitama ($1 for half an egg -.-) is not included and was slightly overcooked.. lame! * I think there was one Japanese chef in the show kitchen -- the rest were Latino/a ... reminded me of Tatsu Ramen  I think I'll stick to pho when I'm in Vegas from now on.",

Ya know, when you don't really know better...  I'd still come back to this place, as it is the closest to me, and it's still pretty good, but the last time I was back here, I definitely noticed the taste difference in just everything.  Ramen is still decent enough for a visit. They are almost always busy (especially since their place is quite small) and service never really falls short. It's such a small place that it's quite hard for the servers to ignore you.  Still will be a regular to this particular ramen restaurant in Vegas, but 4 stars is the most I can give it now.  & I always get the TONKOTSU SHOYU ramen :)!",

Run over across to one of the other spots in the plaza or over to the market across the street.   I get the Miso Ramen and ask for them to make it spicy. You can ask for the spicy ball on the side if you want.  The noodles are pretty firm and chewy. They don't leave a waxy feeling in your mouth. Kaedama (extra noodles) are only a buck fifty more too.  The broth is where it's at though. It's really thick and tasty. I normally get around 4 noodles (1 original and 3 extra) in before I need extra spicy sauce or something to thicken it up.   I'd say this is the number two spot, just can't eek out Ippudo, sorry!",

We saw people lining up outside, after waiting for a little bit, my friend noticed there is a sign up sheet inside!!! Damn it!! They should leave the sign up outside! Oh, there is no sign saying Manto in front, but you can't miss it with the long line outside.  Anyways, after about almost 1 hour wait, we finally got seated at the bar ... which was fine, we get to look at the chefs.  Food! We ordered a Large Pork Belly Rice Bowl to share - the fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly, so tender, buttery, just goes perfect with rice! I really miss this!  Hubby ordered the basic Tonkotsu Ramen with egg added - broth is very bold and tense, and what I love the most is not overly salty!  I ordered the Kuro Ramen with egg added on the daily special board - black garlic oil ramen, I really love it. Egg was perfectly soft boiled, runny center. I do wish that it was thick noodles, this is just personal preference :)  My friend ordered Tonkotsu Ramen with egg and corn added - looks amazing!!  Very good and authentic Ramen place!",

The balance in flavors here is phenomenal. The bowls come out piping hot and perfect!  If you don't like feeling your arteries clog as you eat, you can go for the Miso Ramen or a mixed broth ramen (which have a different flavor profile, but are also wonderfully paired with the ramen noodles).   Tip: get the extras! The pork is DELICIOUS, and if you like eggs with runny creamy yolks, order the flavored egg :)   Also, this is a tiny little ramen shop reminiscent of Daikokuya in downtown LA.....the wait/line can be super long....but the turn-around time is pretty fast because the little shop gets so hot you'll want to leave as soon as you're done eating!",

    "text": "Perhaps this is the best ramen that Las Vegas can produce, but it's definitely not the best ramen out there. It's not even \"pretty good\" ramen. It's simply decent. I came on a weekday for lunch and there were several people waiting outside for a table. This noodle shop is tiny. Luckily, it was only my boyfriend and me so we snatched two seats at the bar. I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen while he had the Tonkotsu Ramen with an egg.   Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen - pork and chicken broth with two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a pile of green onions. The broth was extremely salty, especially compared to my boyfriend's broth. The noodles were rather springy but they were still acceptable. Half of the pork chashu was fat so there was actually very little meat.  Tonkotsu Ramen - pork broth with two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a pile of green onions. My boyfriend added an egg which was soft-boiled so the white was cooked through, but the yolk remained molten. He thought his ramen was OK (and he's a ramen fanatic!). The broth fell flat (although not as salty as mine).  The flavors here aren't very compelling. The portions are generous considering a bowl is about $7 and the noodles come out pipin' hot. The restaurant is quite small so I was feeling a bit claustrophobic. That, coupled with the relentless Las Vegas heat, made me want to bolt outta there the second I was done slurping my noodles. Service was lackluster, not that I was expecting anything phenomenal. If you're in Chinatown and need a quick and warm bowl of ramen, Monta will suffice.",

    "text": "This was my first neg experience here in the 5-6 years I've been patronizing Monta.  I don't come for the customer service, I come for their delicious food, but I haven't had a bad customer service experience until yesterday.   We were in a group of 6 and being waiting on by a waitress named Sanchi or Sachi, she quickly took our orders but didn't repeat or confirm the orders which is what I'm used to. When the food arrived at the table, two of our orders were incorrect. When we told her about it, she looked concerned and then curtly said something along the lines of \"order it right next time\". I was a little stunned by that, but because there is usually a language barrier with the staff there I brushed it off. I wanted to talk to the waitress again, to let her know if it was a problem, just add the two incorrect orders in our bill. I looked around and saw our waitress with another waitstaff named Archer looking at our table and talking/ laughing-- that didn't rub me the right way, and on top of that we didn't get checked in on until Archer came to the table to basically take over for Sanchi/Sachi, I'm guessing she asked him to take over. I explained our experience to Archer, and he was as kind as someone trying to mitigate a customer service complaint could be in that situation.   My take away was feeling insulted, but lesson learned, if you're in a big party or just in general, ask the waitress to repeat your order in there-- they usually do, but it happened yesterday that our waitress didn't, and it's loud and busy in that restaurant almost all the time. Again, the food is amazing, I don't go for the customer service. But I don't go to be insulted either, so make sure to protect your own experience there because customer service doesn't seem to be a priority.",

    "text": "Yes there IS a light at the end of the Spring Mountain Road Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant tunnel!  Tucked away in the back of a somewhat crowded strip mall (on your right hand side as you pass Decatur going up Spring Mountain) is Monta Ramen.  As with most Japanese Ramen houses, this place is tiny but I think that's what makes it feel so authentic.   What sets Monta apart from the others I've tried is the deliciously rich pork bone soup base that you know has been simmering for hours on end.  The noodles are perfect, not too firm but not soggy and the portions are just right.  And if you're crazy enough in thinking about adding that ridiculously priced $1.50 egg, do it.  Even though it costs the same as almost a dozen at the supermarket you won't regret it because it's semi runny/creamy texture blends perfectly with the soup.  Sitting at the bar, digging into my bowl of noodle heaven made me feel like I needed to start loudly slurping to show my appreciation.   If you're in the area Monta is definitely not to be missed...or actually don't go, it'll be a shorter wait for me.  :)",

But I now must admit all I have come to expect is disappointment. I have been coming here for about 2-3 years. But now I can't help but second guess my decisions.   The service here has seemed to have gone down the drain. They give so much attitude and don't really care about the customers. You are rushed to order and if you have any problems or questions you are met with eye rolls and sighs. I'm not a picky eater, not at all, but service is key.   Now to the food. I remember the food they used to have was great. Unfortunately that didn't seem to translate over time. Like watching the slow death of a once great king, the food quality has seemed to die too.  Over salty broth, oily broth, boiled gyoza, and an appalling meat to rice ratio on their side dishes. What happened? WHAT HAPPENED?   To this I'm sorry Monta... You have lost me. I used to defend you feverishly against other ramen places but now... You have betrayed me. So to all you newbies that rave and praise this \"new\" monta. You can have it. I will leave this place in the past.",

My only complaint is that once in a while, the broth is too salty.

I have ramen every 10 days religiously, but I frequent another ramen shop down the street a bit and had never been in Monta previously.  Monta is very good...they do you a solid here with their flavors.  The cramped little space and bustling turnover carries a positive energy with it... if you aren't waiting at rush hour.  That being said, Monta is not my favorite, and while I would happily come back, I probably won't too often since my favorite is so close.  I am all about the miso ramen, so I enjoyed that here as well.  I read Yuhi K.'s review before ordering so I also enjoyed the mentaiko and made sure to use togarashi.  These were excellent suggestions so I'll pass them on as well, but check out her review for more details.    The bottom line for me was that the broth lacked the deep, developed flavors you can get elsewhere, but they have some great options--especially for the kosher minded.  I have had a couple experiences where an individual I try to take to ramen isn't into the traditional pork broth.  Monta takes care of that by offering chicken base.  Monta also has some bar seating with an open kitchen...a great place to dine solo.",

I just came back from a Vegas trip where I made 2 trips here it was that good.  Keep in mind, this little food shopping plaza is a gem in general if you have a car to drive off the strip.  My first time on this recent trip, I went with one of their specials, Kuro Black Garlic Oil Ramen.  There was this amazing, but not overly powerful garlic flavor. I somewhat wish it was more noticeable to be honest.  But everything else in terms of the noodles, chasu and broth was spot on.  I  have a soft spot for corn and an egg... and extra noodle of course =D  My second visit on this recent trip was... right before my flight actually.  I went with my sure bet, the delicious Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen.  Again, the broth was very tasty and flavorful.  The spice is OK, but not as spicy as I probably would have liked/tolerated.    Until I can find better, my go to ramen/hangover spot.",

My friend and I got a massage right next to the place and was ready for dinner when we saw the line outside Monta and got curious. Went inside and saw a small six table dive-ish kind of place so looked at Yelp for some guidance. Once I saw the reviews, I know its a match made in heaven. I signed in so we can get a table and waited 10 mins to get seated. We were lucky because there's only three parties ahead of us. We sat by the bar and ordered 2 gyoza, fried rice, pork belly bowl, a Kura Ramen for me and Shoyu ramen for my friend. The service was quick and efficient and it wasn't long till we feasted on this scrumptious food. First off, the bowls of ramen are huge!!! My black garlic ramen with extra egg was so good I am thinking about it until  now. The broth had depth of flavor and I relished every single spoonful. The noodles were al dente and tasted fresh and went well with the black garlic seasoning, I can eat it all day long. No regrets after I decided to be adventurous and try black garlic anything for the first time. Now on to the Gyoza - they were pillows of soft savory goodness with a slight crunch from being pan friend. The meat was lightly seasoned and was perfect with a lil bit of chili oil and soy sauce dipping sauce. The pork belly bowl was a good sized bowl (I ordered a small) and hit all the right spots with the tender pork belly coupled with the fragrant rice. It was the best $45 meal I have ever had in my entire life. I wish there was one in Houston. I am dreaming of coming back to Vegas just for this. And oh, don't even think about saving it for next day. Enjoy it while you can, and how it should be - fresh on the day of ordering and don't complain about it not being quite the same the following day. As a ramen enthusiast, Ramen is best enjoyed fresh and hot. I cannot wait to go back!!! Now on to dreaming about it again",

Seating is so tight but I guess it also adds to highlight of when your name is finally called and you sit on their wooden chairs and get served almost immediately. The menu consists of 4 simple but very different ramen bowls and a few add ons and very minimal side dishes. But so much easier to choose from.  Love the Tonkatsu Shoyu ramen. I order mine with thick noodles instead which are seeped in pork AND chicken broth. DOUBLE the flavor. I make sure to always order extra chasyu (pork) although all ramen bowls come with 2 slices.  Love the slurp of the noodles and melt in your mouth pork. Slices of mushroom are added as a garnish but even that helps enhance the flavor.  This is only my second time here but I enjoy it immensely and even more so that I got to share it with 9 of my other friends...at the same time! :)",

The food was pretty tasty and and at a good temperature.The texture was great and he serving was large for the price. The reason for the low rating.

    "text": "No other place serves better ramen in Las Vegas.  This isn't debatable.    Sometimes it may be a bit salty or whatnot, but I guarantee you, the other Japanese restaurants in the Chinatown area can never compare to their ramen.  Unless you've found a smaller, hole-in-the-wall place (doubt that's possible, considering how small this place is), then let me know.  Great ramen.  Great for the price, but it's $10 for the ramen plus a couple ingredients.  The service is ALWAYS fast.  I mean, how hard is it with less than 20 seats?  If something concerns you, the server is no more than 10 feet away- call for them when they pass by.  There are several kinds of soup base you can pick from- each explaining in good detail what they taste like.  They are never watery- very flavorful, and each side dish they give you to put into your soup is always fresh.  The ramen doesn't taste like cup noodle.  Someone earlier said that it's a typical, small Asian restaurant- get your food, eat, get the bill, get out.  Ok, that's True.  So what, you're going to knock them down a star for them not having a heart to heart connection with you and not letting you tell them your whole life story?  Please.    Good food, some waiting, good service, cozy interior.. nothing to complain about.",

So you're always looking at a wait time of atleast 10-20 minutes. But sometimes you'll get lucky and have no wait at all. Not gonna lie though. ITS TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT. They're very inexpensive too.  I recommend their Miso Ramen with an add on of Nitamago, corn, and garlic. Sooooo good. And the pork that it comes with just melts in your mouth.  the only thing I hate about going to Monta, is the parking situation. Its such a popular and busy plaza because there are so many restaurants there, so everyone literally fights for parking.",

We were lucky to even get a seat in their tinny space  (bar and tables).   We ordered a shoyu and tonkatsu ramen with a side of gyoza.  Everything is made to order and cooked fresh (though, ramen comes in  plastic packets -- probably shipped from somewhere else).  The gyoza was pretty forgettable as it had charring on the top. They're also not as delicate as the ones in Hakata (my forever ramen love!).   What I did like was their smooth ramen broth base.  Not too thick nor thin and also not too salty. Tonkatsu ramen comes with thinner noodles and shoyu comes with curly thicker noodles. Overall, tonkatsu is the winner between the two in terms of taste.  Pork was too fatty for my liking, but the overall verdict has a good return factor.",

Which is more then enough for a small person like me. But for a guy who loves to eat my boyfriend usually orders with extra ramen. The soup is delicious, you would think the Miso ramen would be really salty but it's really well balanced. I love sprinkling the spices and drowning my soup with sesame oil. I like my soap red and spicy.   Line: The wait usually is 15-30 min the place is pretty small but the line moves quickly because people eat ramen pretty quick. They have small waiting area inside and a bench outside.  Customer Service: The waitresses who work there are super sweet, but once they mixed my order with another table and gave us free kimchi with no charged so I thought that was sweet. The cooks are funny, once I sat at the bar peeking up to see how the cooks make this delicious Ramen and a cook cracks a joke at me.",

Atmosphere 5 / 5: Decorated in a japanese style, Monta is a little bit small with maximum 10 seating tables and a bar but it has a warm and friendly feeling as soon as you enter in the restaurant. Food 5 / 5: I chose the Chicken Ramen (or Shoyu Ramen ) with an addition of Kimchi, Onions, Eggs and if you're REALLY hungry, you can try to go with the addition of noodles. I want to meet you at the same time if you can finish your noodles soup with an addition of noodles, the basic soup is already huge! I also tried their saute fried rice that is excellent. This place is well recommended after a hangover. :-D Service 5 / 5: They're fast! The staff speaks japanese between them and you might see one of the waitress singing a Florida song with her japanese accent (Fun!).  Great finding, thank you YELP!",

The spicy ramen menu items are a little more expensive than the regular ramen, but only because they add a chili paste in the ramen that makes it spicy. I was not a fan of the chili paste that I mixed into my broth. The portion was very generous, but it's not the best ramen I've had. I don't recommend getting any of the ramen bowls spicy!

It was 1115am when we arrived and there was already a line.  The place opened at 1130am on the dot and quickly it was full.  My husband and I sat at the counter which was exactly what we wanted.  We had the opportunity to watch the chefs prepare and cook our meals. Within 30 minutes we ate, paid and left with stuffed satisfied bellies along with a take out meal.   I had the miso ramen and my husband had the Tonkotsu Ramen spicy.  I did love mine but after I devoured mine I went for his and boy was he lucky my belly was full because it was euphoric for me!  I love spicy and will be ordering his next time. We also shared kimchi fried rice which did not make it to a to go bag. Lol. In addition we ordered pork belly bowl to go and had for dinner later that night. It was just as appetizing as our lunch and were very pleased with our decision to get an additional meal to go.  5/5 and will be back!",

    "text": "So far I've tried 4 ramen places in vegas.. Fukumimi, sora ramen, ramen tatsu and monta ramen. Of these 4 I like monta ramen the best. This place is super small so come early or later if you want to avoid the long wait. Their menu is clear and concise.  They don't have dip ramen here.  The reason I liked this one the most was because their broth is super thick and flavorful. I ordered the regular tonkotsu ramen and it comes with chasu, and thin ramen noodles. I usually don't like the spice they add to make it spicy because it detracts from the broth flavor. They said that the spice they put in their spicy tonkotsu ramen is gochugang based ( the Korean spice paste) so it has a sweet note to it. Their ramen price is surprisingly also the cheapest amongst the 4 other places I've tried. My bowl was really satisfying!  If you're a big eater, they also had rice bowls you can order on the side. My friends got the pork belly bowl and the bowl that starts with a t that comes with pickled cabbage. The pork belly bowl was good. It was just fatty cooked meat and rice. The bowl with the pickled cabbage I didn't like. It was way too salty and it has a strange taste. I think that bowl is an acquired taste.",

If they open at noon, arriving at 11:30 will ensure that you sit in the second rotation. People line up! FYI, in case anyone was curious and didn't already know: Not vegetarian friendly.

Small but clean ramen spot, Monta always seems like there is a long wait out the door.  The Kuro Ramen was black & impressive, the Tokotsu Ramen was creamy and deep. Both had thick and rich pork based broth with thin, unrisen noodles. The fried rice was well mannered with excellent seasoning & the gyoza was surprisingly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Service was o-kay ....most likey because it was super busy with only two waitresses on the floor. The whole time, i felt rushed. The glares from the hungry customers waiting for a table to the right of us was piercing & hurting.  Other than that, yes! i'm a fan!!  Good For Kids: Yes Highchair: Yes",

    "text": "I'd rate this a happy 3 1/2 star joint.  We came here on a Friday afternoon during lunch hour. There was a 9 top wait in front of us, but the line moved quickly. There is a sign in system so be sure to get your name and number in your party written down on the clipboard by the hostess podium. They will call your name out when there's a table ready.   The place is TINY! Maybe 8 bar stools by the ramen bar, and 10 tables.   They blast top 40 which creates an odd ambiance, the waitresses are hurried and harried. Case in point: we tried to place our orders when the waitress brought us our water to which point she said she couldn't take our orders right now. She appears when she's ready to take our orders and when we ordered the gyoza appetizer, she screams it to the kitchen. She wrote down the rest of our ramen orders.  We ordered the Tonkatsu and Miso ramen. I made mine spicy ($1 extra). The Tonkatsu is pork broth based, while the Miso was pork and chicken soup base. They were both flavorful and contained green onions, roughly two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. I say roughly because the chashu were very thin and mostly fat, therefore dissolving in our ramen. The spicy I added to my ramen was not mixed into the broth, instead it was a goop that sat on top of the ramen along with my toppings. It tasted like the Korean Gochujang chili pastes, and did not compliment the flavor of the ramen.   There were no service on the remainder of our dining experience, I'm not sure if this is because it's more of a casual counter service/semi-table service.   If you've ever had Santouka Ramen in Arlington Heights or any where else, I do believe they are the superior ramen shop.  All in all it was $25 with tip, so not bad for the experience.",

You go inside and write your name on the list and they'll call you when a table's ready.  We put our name on the list and went over to Kung-Fu Tea to wait.  When we went back over, they had called us and crossed our name off the list so we had to put our name on the list again and wait all over again.  Oops.  But when they called my name they had a high chair ready for my boy and I thought that was pretty great.    $11.78 got me a bowl of tonkotsu ramen and a small order of fried rice.  The ramen was pretty great but DAT FRIED RICE THO....dang it was awesome.  I absolutely loved it. When I go back (and I definitely will) I will just ask for a trough full of that fried rice.  I only got 4-5 bites before my baby stole it and stuffed it all in his face.  It is a strange type of rice and I think it has pork belly in it.    Cheap, delicious, eats.  Woohoo! As good as it gets!",

Noodles were a little chewy, broth was too salty for my taste and worse of all, not hot! And yes I know the heat is usually in the bottom of the bowl. But warm is as hot as it got. Lukewarm by the time the heat escaped the bowl.   It's as if they just poured broth over cold noodles!   Ramen Kobo near my side of town does so much better. Jinya Ramen is still my fave. They never disappoint.",

We had about 3 tables before us.  I dropped my husband off to write our name down, while I drive around looking for a parking spot.  The parking situation in this plaza is VERY limited.  A lot of businesses and not enough space.  I was lucky to find a spot after third loop around.    Beware this place is super tiny, that's why usually the reason why the wait is so crazy during normal eating hours.  I would have to say the capacity would be 30-35 guests total.  I did feel it moves pretty quickly if there isn't a big group waiting.  A good thing to know is, you will need all your party there to be seated or they will skip to the next party.  We ordered some gyoza, it was ok.  Not one of the best I've had.  I had the Miso Ramen.  The broth was ok.  Nothing special.  The noodles so-so.    I wouldn't come back and wait in that line.

Sitting at the counter I was able to watch them prepare the ramen and noticed there was a chef in training. When I received my bowl all looked decent and tasted good with the exception that the ramen was overcooked and soggy. The patron next to me received his bowl and he ordered double meat and they only give him a single serving also which wasn't cool either.   Service was decent, but lets get it together in the kitchen!",

All in all, not worth the wait, though I am a visitor to Las Vegas and this might be the best there is. It's all relative.  Been fortunate to have had really excellent ramen in the past with a similar broth, though richer in texture from collagen derived from boiling the pork bones. The noodles were excellent, the location unpretentious and prices good.",

The broth was my favorite part of this ramen, it was incredibly flavorful. It had the sort of taste that said, \"Yes, I've been simmering for hours overnight, letting all my flavors marinate and get to know each other.\" The garlic flavor was really strong, but it was perfect with the broth.  The chashu and the egg were both really solid. The real kicker here is that the ramen was ridiculously cheap! It was under $10! I was blown away! Value wise, this was the best bowl I've ever had under $10.   Monta ramen is worth a trek away from the strip!",

The dining area was small when compared with the other locations, I would limit to group size to 6 below to be comfortably seated.  I got their Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen.  The noodles was a bit disappointing, it tasted very mushy like they cooked them, but forgot to put them through a cold bath, and all the flour started to flaked off onto the broth.  Definitely did not look the same as some of the older pictures listed here.  The broth tasted ok in general.  Meat was tender.  Other than that, the ramen did not really had much in it, and having bad noodles pretty much ruined everything in the dish.  Service was decent even though they seemed very busy though.  Perhaps they have gone downhill since they first opened?  I might try this place again if they are still open for business during my next trip.",

I feel that the tonkotsu was a good choice to test out the restaurant so I ordered a bowl with egg and corn added.  The total cost was around $10.  The menu seems to range around there with extras for onion, corn, egg, etc. for an extra charge.  The ramen was great.  I don't have much comparison but it was tasty and filling.  Monta Ramen has that must-visit reputation so there's always lines.  It's located in probably the most renowned shopping plaza in Chinatown so add no parking on top of the wait time.  The restaurant only has a handful of table and counter space as well.  The service is really fast and good, but it just takes a while to sit.  Definitely give Monta a try.  It has such a high reputation that if you are a True ramen fan, then hopefully this will be your joint.  They also have a second location in Henderson that hardly ever has lines if you hate that hipster line disease.",

If you see it on the menu, there's usually something they can do to make it to your liking. Just ask the them, they'll tell you what they can do and what they can't. BUT the only meat they have is PORK. If you don't like pork, this may not be your spot. This place is also NOT vegetarian/vegan or gluten free friendly.  Now, let me leave some tips on here to make your dining experience as painless as possible. This place is SMALL. Party of 4+? Prepare to either wait or not sit all together. Parties with younger children, plan accordingly cause half of the seats are bar seats, which small bodies and bar stools don't usually mix well.  Again, this place is small. Give everyone else a chance to enjoy their meal. This is not a hang out kind of spot. You sit, order, eat, pay and leave. You sit there too long, you'll probably feel angry glares from all the people waiting. This place can get crowded real quick.",

While it is small, it seats more than you'd expect and they also have an L-shaped counter with additional seating when you come in.  Always a good sign when you are greeted warmly, there's a sign-up sheet for waiting, there are kids with their folks, and regulars since the waitresses knew some of them by name.   We had the tonkatsu ramen and the shoyu ramen, with corn and shredded green onions.  The noodles were perfect, chewy, and the broth was top notch.  We also had the fried rice and the pork belly bowl.  Don't miss these!  And the food does come out fast from the kitchen.  Compared to the bay area, their prices are pretty reasonable and you get plenty to eat.  Service was excellent.  If you don't like to wait or are a True vegetarian, probably not the place for you.  We got there at 5:30pm on a Sunday and the place was just 1/2 full.  By 6:00pm, it was packed and they had more than a dozen people waiting.  I'm guessing if there's a line somewhere, it's usually a good bet the place is worth the wait.  It is located in a strip mall so there is parking, but there are also many restaurants as well.  They also called a taxi for us when we were done which was awesome.  I'll be back for sure.",

The ramen was definitely better - I wish the noodles had been a little chewier, but the flavor of the soup was very nice. Splurge for some corn and the egg! Prices are pretty good though - definitely cheaper than Chicago ramen.",

I ordered the Miso Ramen with egg and extra chashu. We also got a side of Gyoza and I tried the mini \"Mentaiko\"(Fish Eggs over rice with nori and sesame seeds  The Mentaiko was simple and good with a slight heat at the end, the gyoza was okay. Both the miso and Tonkotsu ramen were also good but these guys are pretty slick about jacking up the price of your order with the add on toppings just like some pizza joints do.  Monta is pretty decent but its nothing like spots in Cali or Back home in Hawaii.....Makes me miss Shiro's and Ezogiku even more...ALOHA!!!",

Great noodles, good chashu, but the tonkotsu broth was waaaay too greasy and rich. It got to the point that I had to dump water from my cup to dilute it down-- [gasp!] I know, what blasphemy!

    "text": "Seating at Japanese Ramen joints are very similar. 3 -  6 tables and a bar, and a waiting list that you write your name on and wait to be called. At good Ramen places, a half hour to 45 minute wait is the norm. They aren't places to linger. They are places to eat and leave.  Early on a Saturday night, before the huge CES tradeshow, we hoped it would not have a line curling around the block as it did the year before during the trade show. With a little bit of parking \"karma\" we snagged a parking spot as someone else left, signed in and waited.  We were fortunate. After 20 minutes, we were in. Some Ramen places do a complete \"meal\" with broth, meat, egg, veggies, etc. for about $15 Monta does the \"basic\" with add-ons that comes up to the same price. But that meant you could get what you extras you wanted. More meat, maybe another egg or an extra helping of corn or nori.  I had the Tonkatsu Shoyo broth (pork bones and soy sauce) with extra charsui (fatty pork), stewed egg and nori. Seated at the bar meant we got a ring side view of the cooks: The huge pots of broth at a roiling boil, how they heated the bowls before using them, the finishing of the bowls.  Once they arrived, we slurped it down - like you are supposed to, before the Ramen sat in the broth too long and the texture changed. Excellent noodles, tasty - very tasty broth, fatty slices of pork and stewed egg with the yolk just a little \"custardy\" - very yum.  Definitely worth the usual wait - if we were to head back there again.",

Monta Ramen is pretty much a dump.  And it's impossibly small too.  There was a line at lunch, but it moves fast because they serve you quickly with their small menu, and you down the food fast because it's so good.  Service was friendly and efficient.    I went with the standard pork ramen with egg and dried seaweed.  Didn't need the seaweed.  The ramen was delicious.  I also tried some of the fried rice, which was just OK.    I can tell from the ramen how good the food is here.  I'd come back here in a heartbeat for more ramen.    Because of the line of hungry diners, go inside and sign up on the clipboard at the hostess station to get into line.",

For dinner you can get soup plus some gyoza or fried rice (which is the bomb, I love it here)  A new thing which is not on the menu is that you can get a mix of the Tonkatsu and the Shoyu broth, that's what I get.  In addition, I always add corn and chopped onion, and an egg if I'm in the mood.  Server's are very friendly, and they work very fast and efficient. It's not a place where you're gonna chill for 3 hours and hang out, the place is small so people are in and out pretty fast.  A little side note:  They have cans of Japanese iced tea which I had in Japan and never had in the US until coming here.  I love that!",

Fellow yelper Vicky L. recommended it to me and I made it my first stop in Vegas, right after picking up the rental car.  We arrived at around 11:45 and got extremely lucky with seats at the counter, because the place filled up quickly by noon with the lunch crowd.  I had the tonkotsu-shoyu and the husband had the tonkotsu. The broth for both were extremely creamy and delicious. If you like things with a bit more flavor, I suggest the tonkotsu-shoyu. The ramen noodles are the thin, angel-hair type which is a nice change from the usual ones we get in SF.   The egg..how could I forget to order the soft-boiled egg? I'm actually still bitter about that. So please do me (and yourself) a favor and add a soft-boiled egg to your ramen.   We also smelled the fried rice aroma from our neighbor and couldn't help but get a small order to share ourselves. It was the perfect portion and hit the spot.",

Menu items of note:  Ramen - well of course, duh!  Lately, I've been getting the Tonkotsu-shoyu flavored broth.  The slices of pork are quite tender and soft, cooked to perfection.  Broth tends to be slightly on the thicker side, but tasty.  Always gotta get the add-on hard boiled egg with semi soft yolk.  The texture of the noodles always comes out right for me.  Service: The waitresses are always friendly to me and very polite.  I think most, if not all of them, are Japanese, which is a good thing, considering I'm eating ramen.  Reasons why I come here: The poker kitchen at the Rio is consistently lackluster every summer, and when I only have one hour for dinner, this is one of the best options.    Also, ramen is one of the hallmark foods of the modern day peasant.  I encourage all other like minded peasants to join me in celebration of......our peasantry? *Fist Pump*",

The place was tucked away in a little mini mall. Plenty of parking in the lot, but it can be a tight fit.  At this time, the place was still relatively full. We were able to get the last open table. The menu is short and to the point. You can choose from four types of ramen broths, add your toppings, or even add extra noodles. As for other menu items, there was some fried rice options and handmade gyozas. We ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen with charsui, egg, and nori; the Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen (a bit less rich than the regular tonkatsu ramen) with same toppings; pork belly rice bowl; kimchee fried rice and an order of gyoza. All tasted great, especially the charsui topping. It had more flavor than in other ramen spots I've eaten at. I could've ordered another order of gyoza.   All in all, a surprisingly good spot that I'll visit again. Keep in mind, they open till 1:00 pm on Friday and Saturday, but they only have about 7 tables and another 7 seats at the counter.",

Then asked some of my Japanese Speaking staff where they go for good Ramen.  They mentioned Inaba and Sora.  I went Sora and finally made it to Inaba last night.  Well actually went to Monta and there was a line then decided to check out Inaba.  Inaba had 2 tables seated, other than that it was empty.  It was good.  Handmade noodles.  Cooked to order.  It took a while to get our food, but it was good.  Would I go back, no.  Then went back to Monta tonight.  I've been in Las Vegas for a little over a month and ate there about 5 times so far.  The Ramen there is Great.  I thought it was good at first, but come to find out that other highly recommended  Ramen Shops can't compare to this.  This is by far the best Ramen Shop in Las Vegas.",

Even at 9:30pm, but they were able to get the four of us in within 15-20 mins, which wasn't too bad.  I'd recommend going with one other person rather than a large group though.  The place is pretty tiny, and the smaller tables turn quicker, and you also usually have the option to sit at the bar.  I ordered the tonokatsu ramen and it was definitely worth the wait.  The soup was deep in flavor, delicious, and pork was extremely tender and yummy.  The soup was just a tad salty for me, which made me want to order more ramen (which you can do), to soak up all the yumminess.  If it were just a little less salty, I probably would have just stuck a straw in it.  I will definitely be coming back during my future visits to Vegas!",

When my girlfriend asks where I would like to have lunch/dinner, this isn't one of the places that comes to mind. It wasn't bad but it could've been better. For one, the staff was a bit rude. Two, the place is ridiculously small so not only is the inside crowded but so is the outside; a crowd of people just waiting to be seated. I want to say there were four tables: three that sat four people and one that sat two, plus bar space. Lastly, the food was a bit on the salty side. I ordered the spiciest thing on the menu but it wasn't spicy at all. In fact, I added a ton of spice to it and it still wasn't satisfying to me. And keep in mind that you pay for EVERYTHING. Even a small plate of spice.  Good but not memorable.",

Maybe Monta is so popular because it's in Chinatown and also in one of the busiest plazas with great restaurants around them. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad.. Monta is good. I usually get the tonkatsu ramen and add in seaweed. I'm indifferent about Monta I think because last time I went, it was a weekday and 10min to closing.. I know restaurants hate it when you come in when they're about to close, but there was still a good chunk of customers in there eating. We were rushed from the minute we got sat and they wouldn't let us order gyoza because it takes 15min to make. We were fine with that and once we placed our ramen, it came out in less than 5min. I didn't realize it at the time but they got my order wrong. I felt so rushed I ate my noodles in less than 5min. From the time we got sat to the time we left the restaurant, it was a total of 20min. Definitely got a stomach ache that night too.",

Gyozas aren't bad, the service was super good also.   Next trip to Vegas, i'll be back! Very affordable menu too. Probably the BEST you can get in Vegas, their ramen cures hangovers!  :)",

This disappointment felt like when Mayweather vs Pacquiao happened, or when Batman Vs Superman fight was so short. All that build up to just flop. I get there parking sucks I know that. I waited, but not that long to my surprise. Place is busy I get that so not really much time for proper service buts thats okay too. Even the long wait for the receipt to print out, because I guess it overheated, was fine. I don't mind waiting because of the experience. In reality If I would of had a good experience I wouldn't have mind actually waiting. I'm a patient guy and I was here too, but reality is that deep down inside I wanted to just go.  I order the Spicy Tonkatsu.I mixed things in, I ordered an egg for it and digged in. I ate, and I ate and I could just not get any flavor from the other ingredients. The only thing I tasted was the noodles and the very thick broth. As far as spiciness... there was none. Not one single sweat came down, not one single sniff of spiciness, just a whole lot of disappointment. The broth was too strong and took all the flavor from everything else. It was not warm enough. My friends bowl had more noodles than mine, he did not order extra. The noodles just felt present. Not really much of an impact there. The meat just dissolved and I didn't even feel anything because of the broth. If I at least had more noddles I would have just enjoyed slurping them more.  My friend had some Gyoza and those were real good! But again thats something I did not order. I did not eat it fast, the bowl just ended quick. I still feel disappointed writing this now. Between the hype, the atmosphere and the awards hanging I was expecting more. My friend ordered the regular Tonkatsu and said it was great. We both agreed though that we have tasted better around Las Vegas. So I may come back, but not for a long time cause I don't want to feel disappointed again, or feel like a sucker. Price is fine for Ramen I don't mind that anywhere. To give you a sense of how it feels today... It's like when you break up with your lover only to go back and be treated like crap and being told, \"I told you so\". Just for me... when it comes to Ramen I want to feel happy to some extent.  I am so glad my first Ramen bowl, I have ever had, was at Aki Matsuri back in 2014 where a restaurant from Japan came in just to sell Ramen for the festival. After that experience, I hold these places, especially this one with awards, with high regard. Sucks, I was really looking forward to this place. *sigh* :/",

I added an egg and roasted seaweed and once mixed all together, the perfect creamy, broth met with my taste buds and my insides screamed with joy. It was perfection. My husband ordered the tonkatsu ramen with butter and that was just as yummy. Daughter ordered the miso broth and she devoured it. We shared an order of the gyozas and they were pan fried pillows of deliciousness.   It's really cozy in there, as in, get ready to wait.  There's about 6 tables, and bar seating.

    "text": "During a foodie excursion to Vegas, we wanted to eat something delicious, yet budget-friendly. After pouring over a few years' worth of Vegas Weekly magazines, authentic Japanese ramen at Monta Ramen made the cut. The restaurant was crowded, but we scored seats! We split an order of kuro ramen and kimchi fried rice.  The slurp-worthy broth was full of flavor and quite excellent, and the noodles were chewy and delicious. It was my first time having kimchi fried rice and it was love at first bite. By now, I've probably eaten my weight in fried rice, but Monta Ramen's kimchi variation was kickass. Monta Ramen for the best ramen in Vegas!",

Baseline offerings are affordable, but in a way its like an American airline- you get nickeled and dimed for every additional item, including an egg. By the time you've built the bowl of your dreams, you're probably pushing a few bucks extra than what you thought you'd be!   The meat here is melt-in-your-mouth and fall apart tender. Really good. The egg is quite tasty as well.  I can tell that the food here is cooked meticulously and with pride when watching the guys cooking your noodles. That being said, I don't think it was really that exciting or remarkable. I got the shoyu ramen with less sodium in it, and the noodles and flavor weren't as good as Ramen Sora's.  If you had to pick one of the two to try, I would try Ramen Sora. The atmosphere at Monta reminds me more of a cold winter day in Japan in a packed ramen house, but I like my American elbow room! Also, the flavors are brighter and portions are bigger at Ramen Sora. ;)",

Monta is located in the heart of Chinatown on Spring Mountain and although it is a divey, don't let that stop you from eating here. The noodles have great texture and the flavorful broth has lots of hidden flavors that will keep your tongue wanting more.  This place deserves 5 starts. Unfortunately I had to knock one down because it is a bit divey and cramped inside. Don't get me wrong, this is my kind of place. I'm willing to bump elbows to enjoy some good ramen. And I have to admit that does add to the charm, however, it can be an inconvenience specially during lunch hours.   Nevertheless, really enjoyed this place and will become a regular.",

Do come and come often, just not when im there because i dont want to wait for you to finish. There isnt much more that i can say that hasnt been said. The ramen is good and cheap, and i love the option for extra noodles for a few bucks more. Pic any of the Ramen options and you will be pleased. But i would away from the appetizer orders like pot stickers, and such because they dont say \"damn i must have those again\" (my opinion). Service is quick, and the kitchen is fast. Your usually in and out of here in 20 minutes of less, so great for quick eats on the fly.",

But worth it! If you come hungry,  you'll be starving by the time your get food. Guaranteed. Hmm maybe that's why its so good? The ramen broth is delicious, I know you can choose between a few, but you can't really go wrong with anything you order. As appetizers, the goyza is a nice touch, as well as the kimchi fried rice. I love how you can see into the kitchen from the dining area. Makes me feel just a bit better that my food is being cooked properly. I would like to give it a half star less for being such a small place, but I guess you can't blame them for being so popular. I hope they expand!",

This noodle house is very, very small and has a very limited amount of seating. I went in about an hour before closing, and were lucky in order to get a seat since it seemed very full according to the wait list from earlier.  Since I don't eat meat, I ordered the vegetarian option that isn't on the menu (you need to ask your server to special request this since not many people know unless you ask). Our server was very knowledgeable and lively with the words she used to describe the ingredients and taste of their dishes. Delicious, all the way! I only tried the vegetarian option, but I certainly will be back when I'm in the area to try all the other items.  Keep in mind this place IS very small, so you're best bet would be to probably swing in on the less busy nights or for lunch during weekdays. Hopefully they'll expand in the future, but I would highly recommend this place in the Chinatown area if you're looking for a slightly different menu other than the many pho places that are around that area.",

The fried rice that we ordered came first and it had the most pleasant taste ever.  For a ramen place, their fried rice was beyond exceptional.  The texture of the rice was just perfection to the tongue, sauteed to a heavenly standard.  The taste just melting into your taste palette is nothing less then the gold standard.  Once the ramen arrived,  the smell of the broth elicited a mouth watering sensation.  The delicate slices of Tonkatsu just melting into your tongue once you start to chew it in your mouth.  The broth was also truly rare and exceptional.  This is definitely a experience worth the wait.  :)",

I ordered:  Shoyu Ramen- Brown and clear color broth, based on a chicken and vegetable stock with plenty of soy sauce added resulting in a soup that's tangy, salty, and savory yet still fairly light on the palate. Added a seasoned hard boiled egg to the soup.  For $6.95 they hook it up with a large bowl filled with equal amounts of broth and noodles. The seasoned hard boiled egg was delish and not dry or rubbery. Added some garlic paste and that soup was the biznass!!  Friendly service + great prices = One happy full customer!!!",

There are the 3 types of ramen you can have (Tonkotsu \"Pork Bone\", Miso \"Bean Paste\" or Shoyu \"Soy Sauce\"). They also have a list of extra toppings like Pork, Egg, Onion, Corn, or Kimuchi. You can also add extra noodles.  The ramen was really good and the place always seems to be very packed every time I come here. I liked it so much the one time I went for lunch I made it the place to go for my birthday outing. There were about 8 of us and even though the place was small they were eventually able to see us. We did have to wait a bit for enough people to clear out to get an appropriate sized table but everyone in my party loved this place. It was perfect for a cold November day.  The staff is very friendly and if you have any questions about the menu they are really helpful. They have other items on the menu but it's really about the ramen. Also, the price is ridiculously reasonable for the amount of food you're given. $7-$8 for the ramen and $.50-$2.50 for toppings.   I personally always get the Shoyu ramen with Pork topping. Very good every time.",

This particular issue of the LP focuses on ramen and the way it's adored and eaten and made in Japan.  Different broths and combinations of broths and perfectly cooked noodles and various garnishes and seasonings that adorn th bowls of love that are slurped in thousands of little ramen houses tucked into the most unassuming little nooks and crannies throughout Tokyo.  Anywho, I've been geeking over ramen literature and got to thinking maybe it was high time I got back to Monta to try to get me a bowl.  The last and only time I tried to get a bowl the wait was half an hour at 2pm in the dead heat of the summer.  There are only around a dozen and half seats up in there so it can be hard to snag one.  This time I waited for my bowl and I'm glad I did.  So good!  Only 3 different bowls on the menu.  I love that.  In ramen joints in Japan the ramen masters only serve one thing, ramen, and do it for decades.  It's artistry and perfection.  I don't know bout them bowls out there out in J, but for my first serious bowl of ramen and the proximity of the shop, I fell in love with my bowl and slurped up every last drop.  Yum.",

    "text": "Ramen flows in my bloodstream. I'm selective with ramen and I know when it's good. This un-nutritious sodium filled bowl of broth and noodles can make or break my day.  Nothing will beat great ramen houses in LA or NY, but being in Vegas, finding a good ramen joint is satisfaction. Monta ramen is located in Chinatown off Spring Mountain.  I opted for the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen  6.95 Tonkotsu-Shoyu (\"pork bone and special shoyu base\") Ramen has a cloudy white colored broth. The broth is like a mix of the Tokyo and Kyushu style blend.  I added green onions and hard boiled eggs.  I prefer the thicker broth and it delivered. It was creamy but not overly fatty. The eggs were cooked to perfection with a moist yolk. The noodles weren't undercooked. I had extra noodles afterwards for $1.50.   In the end, I was filled with pleasure and satisfaction. It wasn't the perfect bowl of ramen but I left satisfied.",

My dad's friends brought him here, so he suggested this place - even took us there - and we were blown away.  We arrived before opening - 11 am (they open at 11:30) - to find that people were already lined up and waiting to get in.  The heat was ridiculous, but these people were waiting inside their cars with the AC running.  Yes. This place is that good.  Luckily we snagged the last table in the very first round of seating upon opening.  (The restaurant is definitely on the smaller side.)  There's a lot of great ramen in LA, but Monta left me craving its ramen.  The Tonkotsu is a total winner, and their chahan is the BOMB.  Service is great, too.  It's no BS ramen - order, eat, and leave!  I will most definitely be back, and I already can't wait.",

    "text": "Short: Everyone in Vegas, local or traveler, should go here. Best ramen I've ever had (and I've had a lot).  Long: I'm a very critical person who isn't impressed very easily. Most of my reviews on Yelp have 3, and the rare 4 stars. This is worth 5 stars.  I went here with a friend, were a couple minutes late and had to wait. It's not in the best place in the shopping center, but doesn't matter much. Get here when they open if you don't want to wait. We ordered their specialty Tankatsu ramen, and was served within 10 minutes (very quick). Noodles were packaged, but very good. The roasted pork on top was thin, but tender and flavorful. The rest of the toppings; mushrooms and bamboo shoots and green onion helped the ramen nicely. What makes it all go together was the soup stock. Amazing.  On top of that, for $7 the price is totally right. Not too cheap, not too expensive. And worth every penny.  Like other reviews compare, the only contender to Monta Ramen is Sora Ramen. I suggest Monta first, definitely. I believe it's on an entire different level than Sora. But, Sora's extra cost does get you more: Thicker meat, more soup, a tad bit better topping, but the noodles and soup stock isn't as good.  Second visit: Still amazing. Had the mini mentaiko bowl. It was good, and a nice side. Third visit: Still amazing. Fourth, fifth, sixth... seventh... I forgot how many times I've been here, but it still blows me away. I had the Miso ramen and that was very good as well.",

    "text": "For a place that's doing so well and getting to be extremely popular, you think they'd have more capabilities to upgrade their AC system or even turn it up a few notches...   But nope! Located in Las Vegas, over 100* in the summer and serving nothing but boiling soup AND an open kitchen that lets heat from the stove circulate throughout the extremely small dining area...Monta is a great place to dine in the winter, but in the summer, you'd have to eat it with struggle. I'd hate to give it less than 4 stars because of its environment, since the food is delicious, but Monta is one of those places where it's really a diamond in the rough, and it will eventually affect the way you feel about the meal overall.  The restaurant itself is very tiny. It sits up to around 30 people max and because of its popularity, it is always packed. They have about 10 items on their menu only, with 4-5 of it being their specialty noodles. The broth here is superb, especially their miso flavored ramen. It is very rich and buttery in taste. The soup is not salty at all, and their noodles are extremely fresh and chewable. It is almost uniquely sweet when you bite into them. The char siu pork that comes with the noodles (japanese pork with soy on the outer skin and slow BBQ) is delicious. The meat is thinly sliced and fatty at the same time. When you bite into it, with the combination of the buttery taste of the broth, you will get an almost guilty sensation of rich flavors. It is really worth the experience, if you can deal with the heat.   Monta gives you the option of adding extra items into your ramen, each of it having a charge from like .50 to $3 ... The only thing that is worth the extra charge (since I ordered it all before-- not worth it!) is the boiled egg, butter, and extra char siu. Everything else will just overwhelm your soup and by the time you're done eating half.. the soup will be soggy and floating with stuff in it.   Just beware though, the standard price starts off at like 6.95.. But  if you get carried away with the extra sides... your ramen can come out to about $14 without you even realizing it!",

The place is pretty small and seats about about 30 people, but from what I've heard from people that have been to Japan the look and feel of the place would be your typical ramen house. The first time I visited Monta was with a group of 6 and the wait wasn't that bad considering it was during lunch and the place was pretty packed. I also liked the fact that you can sit at the counter in front of the cooks so you can see all the action going on in the kitchen.  The food here is awesome, from the ramen to the gyoza to the pork belly bowl all are simple dishes with outstanding flavor. I've tried both the Shoyu and the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen the only difference was the broth where the tonkotsu was a pork bone flavored broth. In both they put slices of pork which have been slowly braised to the point it melts in your mouth. So if you're a pork lover this is the place to come check out. The noodles are cooked to perfection and by watching the cooks they use a fresh noodles in which they cook to order. The texture combination of the soft pork and the chewy noodles makes you want more and more.  I guarantee you will never pick up the package ramen ever again after you've visited Monta. So if your looking for a quick bite and want quality Japanese ramen come check out Monta it will make you say \"cup 'o' what???\"",

In my love-hate relationship with Vegas, things like this definitely belonged to the first category.    Two groups of very jovial Japanese business men occupied the cozy joint when we walked in.  They seemed right at home, joyfully exchanging conversations from across the restaurants to each other as well as the waitresses.  From the smiling eyes to the careless laughter, I make the speculation that they were tourists happy to have found Monta.  I've been there, that rare delight from finding a great Vietnamese restaurant somewhere completely unexpected.    It was a frigid night.  Lips cracked from the desert air, my mouth greedily welcomed the steaming broth of the Tonkatsu Ramen, rich with pork bone flavor and complimented with smooth strings of fresh noodles.  Had it been warmer weather, I'd have opted for the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen, a bit lighter with the mix-in of chicken-flavored Shoyu broth.    I could do without the pricey upsell of add-ons, but I still highly recommend them, especially the soft-boiled egg, corn, and seaweed.  You may end up spending nearly 10 bucks on ramen, but it's still a better choice than anything at Grand Lux",

I'm talking like elbows to elbows.This might annoy some people, but in a way I found it to be charming and like any standard ramen venues you will find in Japan.  It's as real as it gets, as for the venue at least.  As for the ramen, it gets even better.  I waited about 10-15 minutes, sat down, placed my order and waited for about 10 minutes for the ramen to come out.  Not bad, considering there was a lot people in the restaurant.  The ramen was so, so tasty.  Not too hot, the noodles were juicy, and the soup was not salty nor sweet.  I have tried Japanese ramen many times in the past, and I notice that the ramen is ruined because the ramen is too salty or there's too many damn vegetables floating around.  Luckily, for the ramen here at Monta, it was all love.  I had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu, and it was pretty damn good.  The service was speedy, but great nonetheless.  The waitress took our orders, filled our waters, and gave me the check as soon as I asked for it.  All in all, great experience.  I wanna point out that this is a ramen house, so don't expect a variety in their menu.  They have some chicken bowls and gyozas, yeah, but nothing like sushi or whatever.  You won't be wanting it anyway, the ramen steals the show.  PRO: The ramen is great, service is speedy, food comes out quick CON: May get a bit crowded, might have to wait 10-30min on peak hours",

    "text": "Before i get flamed on giving this place only two starts let me explain why to me it deserves three stars.  I was a US Marine stationed overseas on mainland Japan for three years. During those three years i've had the opportunity to eat sushi, ramen, bento bowls, curries, udon, miso soups, and other foods of Japanese origins they way they make it and the way they eat it.  The ramen that is offered here is a step above instant ramen but is FAR from authentic.   The broths are noticeably lighter and less flavorful from authentic, the noodles are in the middle, they're close but dont have the right texture, sides such as meats are too fatty but seasoned better then authentic ramen.  The biggest difference is the price. Here a bowl of ramen runs from 6.25 to 7.something which isnt bad but it's the sides that get you back. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg? 1.50 for a spoon full of pickled mustard greens? 2.50 for extra noodles?  Back in downtown Iwakuni a bowl of ramen, a side of goyza, and a plate of kimchi fried rice was only about 700ish yen back in 2006ish. Who would have figured five years later i'd pay double the cash to have a sixteenth a meal...",

I am a HUGE ramen fanatic so I would certainly recommend coming here for a bowl of noodle soup or their excellent fried rice; however, do not let the prices on the menu deceive you! It only APPEARS like you are eating a quality meal for cheap; however, if you upgrade your food to the way you want it (extra noodles, toppings, etc.), it actually comes out to more $$ than you'd expect to pay for a ramen place. The bill came out to almost $40 between 3 people, which for a ramen place is HUGE!   The service was below mediocre. They weren't attentive and they kept forgetting to bring some essentials... like water, soft drink, etc.. We did not go at a busy time, so unfortunately they had no excuse.   My friend keeps wanting to go back for their fried rice and I wouldn't mind going back to try a different bowl of ramen either :). Just don't go here thinking you'll have the best ramen and service in town from of all the other yelp and magazine reviews, because then you will end up being disappointed like me... Just come here hoping to have some good food and if you have a large appetite, be prepared to spend extra $$ than you expected.",

My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner around 6:00 PM on a Monday and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. The restaurant has about four tables, three tables seat four people each and one table seats six people, and then there is bar seating. As we were leaving the restaurant a little before 7:00 PM, I noticed that there were several people waiting outside for a table.  I ordered the Shoyu Ramen, while the boyfriend had the Miso Ramen. Our food came out quickly in 10 minutes or less, much to our delight. We both agreed that my clear Shoyu broth was much better, as the creamy Miso one was a bit salty. Both of our dishes featured their thick and wavy noodles that had a great, chewy texture. The pork chashu is super tender and melts right in your mouth *drool*. If you are a meat lover, you may want to add extra chashu (four pieces) since the ramen only comes with two pieces. The fatty part of the pieces of meat is what packs such flavor and gets you hooked. I added corn and a soft flavored egg as extra toppings to my bowl. The bamboo and black jelly ear mushrooms that come with all ramen dishes made each bite unique and delicious. The Gyoza dumplings were just alright - I probably wouldn't order them again.   I will definitely visit Monta Ramen again the next time I am in Vegas!",

People are taking cabs to this place from the strip since they heard good thing's about it.  Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen is what I went with. It's a blend of pork and chicken broth. Basic toppings are green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. Of course me being super hungry I got extra pork, Nitamago(seasoned hard boiled egg) and extra noodles. So fresh and super good. We also got Gyoza (Handmade pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings). They were flavorful.  This place is not super big but the food is worth the wait to get a table. 4 stars.

    "text": "First off, this ramen place is in a favorite plaza of mine known for amazing food: Trattoria Nakamura-ya, Snowflake Shavery, Zen? I have had this place on my bookmarks for a while.  Stopped in today for a solo lunch- was seated quick as there was a spare spot open at the bar, but when I first went in there was a wait list. Yes, at 3PM on a Saturday. Plan ahead if you're going with a group!  Service was great- two super-sweet ladies were attentive and friendly throughout my visit. Placed my order for the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen, added the egg, nori, and shredded green onion. Initially I was put off by having to add on my favorite ingredients separately, but the silver lining to doing so was that I was able to meet the $10 credit card minimum without buying a separate appetizer.  While waiting for my bowl, I was entertained watching the guys in the kitchen making endless batches of noodles. Got my order fairly quick as the restaurant started emptying out a bit.  My first reaction was one of happy surprise: the steep $1.50 fee for green onion got me a shredded nest of it atop my bowl, an unexpectedly gigantic amount that found itself in every bite I took. In a good way! Found the noodles to be thinner than I prefer but cooked to a perfect al dente. Shredded the nori into small pieces to distribute throughout my bites. The broth lacked the depth that I've had elsewhere, but I was pleasantly surprised to use the brown garlic oil on the table and get a robust improvement in the flavor. Potential new favorite condiment alert! Sad to note that the chashu was somehow lost among the kicked-up broth and sea of shredded onion. What is usually a highlight of my ramen experience was just mediocre here, the cut I had was not fatty nor was it particularly flavorful either.  I will likely be back because service was great and there are other varieties to try on the menu, but I was slightly underwhelmed by the bowl I got today. Location is everything though, and this noodle house is conveniently located and will likely result in repeat visits.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my tonkotsu ramen at Monta. If I had to pick a ramen restaurant to go to in LV, I wouldn't hesitate to come back. It's about 10-12 min ride from the strip via uber in non traffic so swing out there after a day of gambling or beach clubbing and pick up a very delicious bowl of ramen.   We sampled several dishes while we were there. I tried the tonkotsu, the spicy tonkotsu, some of the fried rices, and the gyoza.   As with all Japanese dishes I hardly detected a major difference between the regular and the spicy so that is kinda moot. The tonkotsu itself is creamy and a tad bit too salty but very filling. I didn't even finish my soup so I'm not sure if I blame the noodle portions or my \"diet\" that I was on. You have the option of selecting your type of noodle from udon and thin style I believe. I went with the regular thin noodle and was not disappointed in the least.   The fried rice was not to my taste so I had one bite and that was about it. Nothing negative to say about it but just wasn't a winner for me.  What knocked my rating down 1 star was the way the seating was done. I observed a table with enough for our party get given to a party with three less people than ours which in turn if they had just waited one second for them to clean the table they could have given them the appropriate size table. We had to wait thru two of those moments and I watched as the host just put people around helter skelter.   Our waitress was pleasant but she did forget one of our orders and we had to remind her. Can't blame her, it was towards the end of the shift so be prepared for end of day exhaustion because some of these people work really late.",

Umm.. not to be mean or anything.. but I still haven't had any better tonkatsu ramen than Santa Ramen in San Mateo. Here was the tonkatsu ramen I had at Monta: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UPIYuRaZvknINOd1w8kqRQ?select=iPsp5gVQWZ-u3E5DzNlFOQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/UPIY...</a>  It was SOO salty!! Good thing my friend ordered the exact same bowl, because his wasn't salty but mine was, it wasn't just me. I told the waitress and she said \"I can either give you hot water or take it back for them to cook again, but then it would take a while.. do you want me to give you hot water to try first?\" I said sure since I was hungry (it's a small restaurant and a long wait).   She gives me hot water, I add half the bowl and it was still salty.  Disgusting.   She didn't even come back to ask if it was okay until after I was done with the whole thing!  Good job lady.  Yeah I finished the whole bowl but it was still salty.   My first instinct was the Tonkatsu-Shoyu bowl anyway, but the same waitress said tonkatsu was better, since it's more popular and very creamy. And it failed.   Lesson learned: Go with your first instinct!! It's usually always right.",

Lately though, I find myself enjoying the hidden gems of Vegas more and more; eat where the locals eat and you can't go wrong. Monta Ramen is one of those fine establishments.   Hands down the best Tonkatsu ramen I have ever had. The presentation is simple, but the flavors are out of this world. By far my most favorite part of the dish is the pork belly. Thinly sliced and melt in your mouth juicy, even the L.A.'s Daikokuya doesn't match. Also ordered a side of Kim Chi fried rice. The dish was unremarkable, and unnecessary since the ramen portion was filling.   The place is small, and popular so be sure to get there early!",

Oh, and always a must for me is a clean restaurant and great service so that was met as well.

    "text": "It has been some time since I had good ramen.  San Francisco is one of the best foodie towns but it fails miserably in terms of ramen offerings.  We stopped by Monta on a recent trip to Vegas.  It is located on Spring Mountain road like most of the other popular nearby offstrip spots and is located in the same strip as Raku and Kung Fu Tea.  The parking lot is a bit tight and can fill up pretty quickly on busy nights but there is street parking and we have used the lot opposite of the strip (store was closed).  There was a short wait at Monta as expected but it was reasonable - only 3 other names on the clipboard.  The shop consisted of a long L shaped bar and 10 or so small tables.  Not a huge place but not small either.  We all ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and Tanaka fried rice as recommended.  The default toppings were a bit sparse (pork, bamboo, ginger, 'shrooms) but considering the price (under $7) I didn't mind.  I added a soft boiled egg to mine - other standard toppings were available (corn, more pork, butter, etc) We were pleasantly surprised at the turnaround for the ramen - within 5-10 minutes.  The broth carried plenty of flavor but was a bit thicker than the other ramen shops.  The noodles were thin and firm but not overly so.  The bowl only came with 2 slices of pork but it was expertly prepared - tender with a good combination of meat and fat.  There was a slight aftertaste (from MSG?) but easily queched from the Kung Fu milk tea from next door.  The fried rice was solid but a bit salty.  It was more than likely from the mustard leaves either being too abundant or just overly salty themselves.  Not bad but I may go with the potstickers or simply stick with the ramen next time.  A definite stop for me in Vegas the next time I am craving something soupy or noodles.",

I got the tonkotsu shoyu, fried rice, and green tea. The ramen soup and noodles were very good, although I didn't like the meat. It says it's pork but it tasted like turkey and a mix of something else so I didn't eat it. The rice was good too with soy sauce but was a bit too eggy for my liking.   Service was good! Was asked twice if I needed refills, check came quickly, and just about everyone said thank you as I left! I would definitely come back just not get the pork or whatever that meat was.",

I suggested eating at the bar, since I know there is a fan blowing right next to the cashier area.  But the restaurant was still pretty packed (11 of us total) at around 4pm on a summer Saturday.  I tried the Shoyu Ramen this time, while my friend tried the Miso.  Shoyu was good and I didn't feel it was too salty like the other two ramen.  And my coworker enjoyed the Miso Ramen. Both of these options are prepared with the thick ramen noodle (just FYI), which I prefer anyway.  Overall, another satisfying dining experience at Monta Ramen.",

It's packed and you will be fortunate if you are seated right away.  At the same time, both times we were there we only waited 5-10 minutes so they do turn them pretty quickly.  Orders are taken promptly by pleasant wait staff, and your meal is turned around quickly as well, within 10 minutes.  Their ramen are overall the best I've had - not greasy, fresh, with nicely firm noodles - although from pure taste standpoint I probably prefer Hiromaru (RIP).  Their fried rice is really good, as is the chashu don.  These are more like side dishes from size standpoint, but probably too much for one person to have a ramen and one of these.  Maybe 2 ramen dishes and one will work for two... I say that because they're really good and you should really try them.  Great atmosphere, bustling crowd, and great food all equal to the best ramen joint I have been to yet.  It's probably more like 4.5 stars, but I want to differentiate between this and other 4-star places I've rated so I'm giving it a 5.  Table-for-1 Factor:  Yes, and there are many who partake.",

There's limited room to wait inside, so you're on the sidewalk of a parking lot, which can be pretty hot at times.  Service was efficient and friendly, ramen bowls were delicious and served quickly, and food is inexpensive as is typical for this type of fare.  Overall, good food if you're just looking to chow down and move on, but not much to offer beyond that.",

But the thing is, \"I'm definitely not a Ramen-guy!\"   Because I'm not contented with just noodles, flavored broth, diced meat and/or vegetables in a bowl.   It's been a LONG while since I've had a bowl of Ramen....even before 9/11 to be exact (yeah, that long).    I met up with a bunch of friends in Las Vegas and each of us ordered one of the restaurant's tasty Ramen Noodle. I ordered the Chashu and Tonkatsu Ramen Noodle Bowl. For $6.95, it's not a bad price and had slices of Chashu and noodles in a flavorful Miso soup. The soup/meal was actually pretty good and comforting. This bowl of soup would definitely warm me up in a cold winter night in San Francisco.   I got my ramen soup very fast and the service was also good.  Friends used credit cards for their meals. But I paid my meal in cash.",

I thought to myself, \"heck yeah, this wait is going to be worth it because I've heard a lot of good things about this place!\" Tried the food. Wasn't impressed. I ordered a Shoyu Ramen and a mini mentaiko bowl. I expected the mentaiko bowl to be delicious, and it was--but trust me, after a few bites that sodium content will turn you off. A few minutes later, the shoyu ramen came. Too salty for my tastes.  My cousin ordered a Tonkotsu ramen and I tried it. I wish I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen instead because it wasn't AS salty, but still pretty salty. My dad ordered a miso ramen. Again, it was salty.  You get the gist.  Aside from the salty dishes, we ordered gyoza and fried rice. The fried rice was pretty standard and the gyoza was just a bit better from the frozen ones you can get at the store. Neato. Maybe I'll come back when I'm low on sodium intake.   The only good thing was the service. I wouldn't recommend this for big groups because the place is pretty small and it's usually packed whenever I'm around the area.",

The restaurant is small, only a handful of tables. But that doesn't stop people from waiting, this place is so popular! Every time I go, there's always a line, especially when they open, so be prepared to wait up to 15- 25 minutes. Plus they won't seat you unless your whole party is here, even if it's only for 2 people. My must-haves are the Tonkotsu or Miso ramen and the Takana fried rice. Their Chashu bowl is also very delicious. Once you get seated, the staff is pretty quick about taking your order and the food comes out fast, within 5-10 minutes. Monta's is definitely the place to go in Vegas for quality ramen.",

I could feel a slight breeze from the air conditioning which was really helpful since it was 100 degrees outside!   The interior was small and dark. There were 5 tables and 9 counter seats. There were a few chairs for customers to wait for a table. Make sure you get your name on the clipboard!   The gyoza was shocking. ..it looked pale and undercooked,  like it was just fried on one of its 3 sides.  The inside was bland and flat tasting.   On the other hand,  the miso broth was really salty and the noodles were too soft. I didn't finish it.  The toppings of green onion, bamboo shoots & black fungus were room temperature as if they were hastily thrown on the top.   I would only go back if the competition down the road was full and if there was no line.  If there was a line,  go to the other restaurants right next door!  Sorry...",

I tried the miso ramen with extra pork chashu and it was so rich! They also had kimchi fried rice so we decided to try that as well.   Was I was impressed with was the speediness of our orders. No more than 8 minutes pass by and we were served 4 different ramen bowls and a plate of fried rice. I believe we were in and out in less than an hour.

There's roughly enough tables/seats in the restaurant for 18-24 (off of memory). Then there's some bar stools for dining as well. It was our first time there, and being from the Bay Area, we've had some good Ramen back home, this place is comparable, if not better than most we've had. I like how you start out with your choice of \"base ramen\" and then do your add-ons from there. We tried the Miso and the Shoyu. Both were good, but I really liked the Shoyu flavor. We added the Pork Chashu, Flavored Egg, Corn, Nori, Fresh Shredded Green Onion, and when you add it all together and top with the pickled ginger -- you got some yummy ramen goodness. We also ordered a small bowl of the Pork Belly Bowl. This was really good as well, very tasty, comfort food (if you like a good bowl of rice and meat). We also had the Gyoza, which was fine. When we're back in Vegas, we may have to come back again.",

Both very good. Kimchi fried rice was the better of the two. Not authentic korean but that ok because this is a Japanese restaurant, not korean.

Always seeing the long lines whenever eating in the neighboring establishments, we had always passed up on coming until now.  Monta Ramen is in the literal hub of Chinatown, as everything here boosts popularity. From Zen, Trattoria Nakamura-ya, Snowflake Shavery, and Raku, be warned that finding a parking spot during busier times can be almost impossible.  We were promptly seated as soon as a table was available for us. If there is a wait, I suggest figuring out what you want before being seated. The servers here work efficiently, so be prepared!  I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. Prices were pretty cheap and there are extra toppings for you to add. Be warned as these add-ons are are lot more expensive than other ramen joints in town. As much as I wanted to like the food, I couldn't. The broth was thick, creamy, and filled with so much sodium I felt parched shortly after attempting to drink the broth. I couldn't taste much else from the ramen because of how heavy and salty the broth was. The other two in my group seemed to agree, as we all usually finished our ramen bowls from other restaurants, but suddenly had a hard time finishing half these bowls. We felt sick after leaving the restaurant.  As popular as this place is, I really cannot see why. Maybe it was a bad day and I will someday give this place another try. But for now, I'd rather go to a ramen place that doesn't make me feel nauseous.",

The cha siu came in huge slabs that covered a great portion of the bowl. The ratio of lean and fat was well balanced. My friend had the kuro with black garlic oil.

I didn't expect a wait list but we put our name down and waited, no too long around 10 minutes. We sat at the counter!  We ordered the gyoza, the pork belly bowl, the chashu bowl, spicy tonkotsu ramen and the shoyu ramen. It was all very good, the broth was perfectly blended, warming the noodles through and the pork belly bowl is worth a repeat, it was top of my favorites list!   Service was great, food was great, now that cold weather is upon us, this may become a welcome spot!",

I like the wavy thick noodles that is offered in the miso ramen and shoyu ramen.  The thin straight noodles are good too but I like the thick kind.  You can choose from Tonkatsu (pork), Shoyu, Tonkatsu-Shoyu, or Miso broth.  You can make any broth spicy.  There is also a new broth that is the Tonkatsu broth with black garlic oil.  Sounds yummy.  The broths are all great and there are yummy add-ins.  I always add corn.  If you are feeling extra indulgent add some butter!  I like to wear a dark colored shirt so that you can't see all of the splash marks from the soup.   The sides are good to start off with.  The fried rice is actually pretty amazing.  The chunks of meat in the fried rice are delicious.  Gyoza is always a safe bet too.  Expect to wait.  That is the only reason I am not here more often.  I hate waiting to eat.  This restaurant is tiny and there are a lot of Monta fans out there.  You can try their other location Monta Chaya in Henderson if you are closer to that side of town.  Haven't been myself but it's owned by the same people.   Happy Ramen-ing :D",

However, because this place has that good of ramen, everyone is bound to end up here. When you walk in there is normally a line or a couple groups ahead of you. Be sure to write your name on the list and include the number of people in your party. They may not get to you for a while so just be patient. When you are seated, whether it be at the bar or at the table, you'll see why there is such a wait!   PS. They have another location now on Eastern that serves the same ramen with a couple more appetizers than this Monta spot & the place is much larger. If you're not into waiting too much, I recommend heading to the Eastern location.",

    "text": "Saw this place on multiple lists of where to eat in Vegas and my brother who really loves ramen recommended it as well. Very small place and that is the reason for a long wait time. I had 6 people in my group and we had to wait about 45 min. Groups of 2/3 were just going in and out. The menu is very simple and to the point with the different types of ramen they offer and the description of the broth and toppings. The first thing that stood out to me were the prices. Everything was less than $9. They also have other items like fried rice and gyozas. I ordered the Kuro Black Garlic Oil ramen and substituted the thin noodles for the medium thick noodles and added eggs, corn, and a sheet of seaweed. I'm not big on ramen but I really enjoyed my bowl. I even drank my broth from the bowl. The flavors were great and the noodles are hand made. For my table that ordered 6 bowls of ramen and an order of gyoza, our total was just under $75. That blew me away because I've always seen and spent at least $15 for a bowl ramen and most of them did not taste as good as here at Monta's. My only tip is expect a longer wait if you have a group of 4 or more because there are not many seats and the place is small. Definitely worth checking out especially for the prices and quality. Service was also great!",

The second time it was a group of six and we waited probably an hour total (or at least one of our party waited an hour). This place is pretty small and I was hesitant with six people, but it worked out in the end. You probably shouldn't do more than six unless it's dead and both times I've been it was obviously busy (hence the wait).   However, once you get inside and order your food comes out relatively quickly and it's very tasty. The price is also quite nice because for being such a busy place they could probably charge a bit more (like lots of other ramen places) and still keep he crowds coming in.  Overall, I enjoy Monta and I'd probably go back, but maybe just as a group of 2-3.  Kimchi fried rice is so good.",

So when friends would rave about these ramen restaurants, I shrugged it off and remained widely uninterested.   It is just now that I am realizing how awesome and authentic this comfort food can be. Winter weather = ramen weather! Definitely slurping it up and making my rounds this season, and Monta was one of these. Lol, guess who's clearly late on the ramen train!  Parking is packed. Place is tiny. Sign yourself in and be prepared to wait. Make sure that your whole party is present, or they won't seat you. It happened to us. Makes sense though when your establishment is only about five tables and a limited bar area.  I had the shoyu ramen with nori (seaweed) added...I don't have any proper adjectives to describe it for you since I am nothing but a ramen amateur, but it was good. I do know I like thick noodles in my soup and it had that. My boyfriend had the miso and it was creamier compared to mine. We both shared the regular fried rice, which was a nice contrast. I drank their green tea, iced, and it came in a can. My other friend wanted hot tea, and it too, came in the same can, but heated. Strange. Overall, good ramen!",

I heard a lot of good things about Monta Ramen and was eager to give it a try. Despite the 112 degree Las Vegas heat, good ramen is worth the wait and the sweat. My name was sixth on the list and it took about 15 minutes to be seated.  Not bad for a weekday lunch time and a highly rated restaurant.   The inside was pretty small but they've got the air condition kicking with a fan inside.  It was a definite relief from the heat outside. I wouldn't bring a party of more than six here because it may take longer to get seated.  The waitresses were polite and attentive. My friend and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen for $6.99 each which is a steal!  The order arrived quickly and first thing I notice is the broth is rich. You can see a lot of flavor packed into the bowl. It's a good mixture of saltiness, fat, and an overall creaminess that went well with the pork slices and egg. The noodles are thin and firm, perfect to slurp with the soup!  I quickly finished the bowl and drank all the soup before my long drive back home.  Great way to end my LV trip and can't wait to come back in the future to try something new on the menu!",

Monta Ramen is a fairly small ramen shop, seating maybe about 25-35 including the ramen bar area, but like most yelpers are keen to point out, they do try to move guests along. My family of 4 came right at the peak of dinner 7pm and only had to wait for 20 minutes, not too bad if you ask me.  We started our meal off with a pork belly bowl which was just savory goodness. The pork drippings from the fat coated the each grain of rice and made it all savory, buttery, and utterly delicious. The slivers of red ginger also helped to cut the fattiness/greasy factor of this dish.  Next came our orders. We each ordered some variety of ramen, but noticed that only the miso ramen came with \"traditional\" ramen noodles. Everyone else received these thinner noodles...still good, but not what we expected. I added a pad of butter and corn to my dish which made it more complete in my opinion....I also appreciated the fact that add-on's here ranged from $0.50 to $1.50 as opposed to my regular $1.50 to $3.00 in the Bay Area (for the same two spoonfuls of corn in most cases). My only complaint, outside of the noodle-snafu, was that our ramen was delivered lukewarm at best. It was a little off-putting.",

The kuro ramen was really good, just the right amount of garlic so I didn't feel the need to add any(there's garlic on the table if you want to add it). We also got gyoza and fried rice.

It is a tiny restaurant, requesting bar seats will get you seated faster typically if you don't have many in your party (i.e. 3 or less) and there is a clipboard to sign in on by the door.   3 stars due to the fact they allow non service animals in the restaurant.

The seating is very limited so naturally there was a little bit of a wait.     After making it to the bar area me and my wife were extremely rushed to make a drink order as well as a food order right away. I ordered the spicy pork broth with nori and egg along with a hot tea. The hot tea came out right away inside a very hot can which was placed inside a cheap plastic cup. This is the first time in my life I was ever served a \"hot tea\" this way, and I unfortunately burnt my fingers quite badly picking it up. After pouring it in the cup which the can was inside I decided not to drink it, not only because of the awful taste, but I was attempting to be conscious of the potential health hazards.         My ramen came out almost instantly afterwards; but to my dismay, the broth was nearly ice cold, and there was no nori inside either. Other reviews have stated that the broth wasn't hot either, so my theory is that they make it that way to turn tables as fast as they can; as I felt extremely rushed by our server who was already making mistakes with my order. The noodles and eggs were the only two things in the bowl that tasted up to standard. I was able to get the nori off my check, and I had to deal with a slight stomach ache afterwards, but thankfully nothing too terrible.     I am very happy that I was finally able to eat here so I know very well that I should never come close to this place again. There are many great ramen spots in town, and this is absolutely not one of them!",

    "text": "I had high expectations for this place since our friends said it was the best ramen ever. Not the best, IMO, but still good.  SPICY TONKOTSU RAMEN $8 - The ramen noodles were pretty good, but the soup was way too fatty for me. I usually love fatty ramen soup but the soup here is ridiculously thick. Drinking the soup alone will fill you up. I also don't think the spicy version of the tonkotsu ramen is worth it, since it's $1 more than the regular version and not very spicy at all. I had to add extra spicy powder and oil.  Extra noodles are $1.50 and if you want to share, I suggest just getting 1 bowl and adding extra noodles to split. This way you basically get two bowls of ramen for $10.  FRIED RICE $6 - Pretty good, but not worth it for $6.  TAKANA FRIED RICE $7 - Expensive! Save your money and get ramen instead. This also tasted like mushrooms.  Be prepared to wait, because this place is really popular, even when it's hot outside. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny, with only a couple of tables and a bar area. The restaurant location is in a plaza with a bunch of other popular Asian food places, so be prepared to spend time looking for parking.",

    "text": "DELICIOUS. Although the wait was terrible EVEN on a Sunday afternoon at 3:30pm... Yes, you heard right... 3:30 pm and we still had to wait an hour to get seated. I am impressed with the fact that they stay True to their word that seating is first come, first serve. As in, if the next table open is can seat 4 people and you're next with a party of 2, you are still the ones to get that table. That was definitely what I wanted to hear after that long, terrible wait. But this means you will have to make sure you are present when they call your name, because I am almost certain they will also keep their word that you will be taken off the waiting list with no exceptions.  The food itself was fantastic. The broth was perfection, thick and flavorful. The noodles are the thin kind, which wasn't a problem for me. My friend got the spicy fish egg with rice side dish and unfortunately hated it. She took two small bites before leaving the rest untouched due to the fact that it was way too salty.   Overall, just don't get in line starving and expecting to get seated immediately, no matter what random hour you arrive. Thankfully the food came out fast after ordering!",

    "text": "Not bad, Monta Ramen... not bad at all.   Three of my friends and I came here after a night dancing looking for some soup to appease our parched bodies. Here are some things you should expect:   1. Parking Easy peasy. There is a big lot, so no need to worry about that.  2. The wait Oh my goodness. We came to this place like 40 minutes before it opened, and there was ALREADY A LINE. This being said, I HIGHLY recommend coming early & waiting, unless you want to be in the hot Las Vegas sun, grumpy, hungry, hungover and sweaty.   3. The ramen I ordered the new spicy tonkatsu ramen with an egg. It was SO GOOD! The broth was very flavorful and not too salty (although, I've been told that I have a salty palette.. to each his own.). The pork in the ramen was soft and melted in my mouth! My only regret is not getting extra. My boyfriend got the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with fat noodles, which was good, but definitely not as good as mine... I think his was TOO salty for my taste (which again, has been known to be on the salty side). Even thought my ramen was overall really good, I couldn't finish it because it felt way too heavy/greasy in my stomach. I actually ended up with a small stomach ache after.   4. The service Okay, I guess I have to cut some slack here, because there were only 2 workers manning the floor, but it took FOREVER to order/flag someone down... it kind of felt like they were ignoring us on purpose at first. Nobody likes to have to compete for attention! #middlechildsyndrome #i'mnotevenamiddlechild #yelpdoesntevendohashtags  5. The value SUPER CHEAP! Also, a coke was only ONE DOLLAH! To me, that seems unheard of in a restaurant...   All in all, I recommend it. If you're like me and you easily get stomach aches from food that is too heavy, buttery or greasy, I'd recommend getting a coke or a sprite with your ramen so that you can burp all out alll dat ish.",

Didnt smile at all what soever and we felt rushed actually. she dropped off my check and said \"here.\" Really? hmmm..  Never checked back on us to ask if everythinf was okay, if we needed anything. The only time she came back was when she was dropping off the check and asked \"u want more water?\" hmmm..  Im a server too, and it wasnt really that busy at the time. wait was dead already, no need to rush us and make us feel unwanted.  Since im a server of course i still left 20% despite of the poor service we received. When we come back next month, i will make sure not to be served by yuri.",

The wait was about 30 mins, then the line grew as we were waiting for our table. We ordered: - Soyu Ramen (extra chasiu) - 2 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and egg) - 1 Pork belly bowl - 4 drinks total is around $50  Since this was the first time trying a Ramen spot besides my own mothers, I decided why not, since one of my co-workers have been asking all of us to go everyday at work. We entered the restaurant after the wait and the table are really packed close together (so it's like we're eating the table next to us). The people in line are watching other people eat, it's kind of awkward.  I tried my ramen, it was good but not the greatest (I told him, the hype he was giving this restaurant was not necessary anymore). The chasiu was weird, it was disintegrating in my soup. It was mostly melty, fatty, and I found it pointless to get extra.   My love got so sick from this place, he was perfectly fine, until that night. He was sweating and grabbing a fever, everything came out from both ends for a couple of days. He's afraid to try Ramen again :(",

Solid bowl of ramen, the tonkotsu broth is slightly more viscous than other broths I've had, but it was flavorful with a long complex finish.  The noodles were cooked right - not mushy at all nor undercooked.  It came with two slices of tender pork belly, and the add on option of seasoned egg had a good runny yolk.",

I have a salty palette and even for my taste buds, it was too high in sodium.  But what I loved were the small bowls of mentaiko and pork belly. We ordered 2 small bowls of mentaiko (fish eggs over rice, embellished with green onions etc) and 2 small bowls of pork belly over rice.   I also loved how they had kimchi on the menu. Most ramen places do not offer kimchi!   Loved everything about the place except the wait and the saltiness of the ramen.",

The space is really small and it gets crowded. The chairs at the bar were really uncomfortable. And they seated like 3 parties before we sat down when we were there before all of them!!! I usually crave monta and love it, but it's the Eastern location that has my heart. I asked nicely if they had the chasu buns here and the lady was rude and said \"no we don't.\" It was just a question. Anyway, probably won't be going back to this monta again. Sad because it used to be a favorite. Looks like I'll stick to the one in Henderson with nicer staff and better quality food. Ta ta for now!",

I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen, and I must say, I have had more flavorful broth but the noodles were a nice texture and the ratio of noodles to pork was fairly equal.   I loved that this place was open late and although it was packed when I first arrived at 12:30am, I was seated within 15 minutes of arriving. I also enjoyed that they had all the condiments already on the table, including the fresh ginger. I always ask for ginger and I'm glad this time I didn't have to!   I am biased towards my ramen spot in Torrance, however I'm still a fan of this place. I would come back again!",

If u are feeling extra hungry you may want to order extra noodles. I had the spicy tonkotsu for $7.95 . Just spicy enough to make my nose run but not too spicy for me to eat. Friendly service and really fast service. I've waited longer for some meals at McDonalds. I will definitely be back here .",

I came here on a cold day and let me just say that this place is so small lol I really didn't expect how small the shop was going to be, but I really liked how cozy it was. There were only about 4-5 tables and a bar area, but people seemed to be really considerate by not camping out and most of the parties seated left shortly after finishing their meals, which I was very grateful for.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen and the boyfriend ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and we honestly just fell in love with our food. Both broths just have so much flavor that you just can't help but mindlessly sip on it long after the noodles and toppings are gone. We also had an order of the gyoza, which were tremendously tasty as well.   I never thought that I'd find a good ramen place in Vegas, but this place just really won me over. It's definitely my number one for ramen, which really sucks because I'm from LA and that is way too far from this place. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area.",

There's only a handful of small tables here and limited bar seating, there is almost always a queue. It's well worth the usually short wait time.  The kitchen with steaming cauldrons and busy cooks can be seen over the bar and creates a fun atmosphere.   The menu is straightforward and uncomplicated. I love the simplicity.  The gyoza are crispy and delicious, the ramen is always cooked perfectly, the chashu pork is tender. They have some killer sides and rice bowls.  Everything is reasonably priced.  The pork belly rice bowl is phenomenal. The meat is slow braised into buttery, tender melt in your mouth goodness.  The waitresses are friendly and accommodating,  especially considering how busy this place is.   They could probably use a larger space with more tables to eliminate the wait times, but the small space is part of the charm. Enjoy it.",

Small booth tucked in a corner. No heavy signage just three folks sweatin in the polstering heat serving up what unbeknowst to me the best ramen showcasing. Found out that they have a location out in Las Vegas and decided to take some family members out there to give it a try.  Got there 30 minutes before they opened. All of us hungover from the night before, only to see that there is a line about to form! We turned off our engines parked and snagged in front of the line. in 30 minutes I kid you not, at least 40 others joined. Luckily we were in front.   Starving and dehydrated. We ordered. I settled for the Spicy Tonkotsu with the added green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. Added additionally the Nori + Nitamago. (dry seaweed and hard boiled egg, respectively) some corn, etc. My gal got the Tonkotsu BLACK. and whoa. I've never had a ramen to that degree ever in my 30 years of life. What is this? A smoky flavored broth? almost like a bbq tang? THIS was my highlight. It was unusual. It was weird. But in the most gnarliest of ways a ramen can be. I highly recommend that one.   fyi: their Chasu Bowl is one of the better ones I have experienced in all of CA. Definitely worth it as a side dish.   As a matter of fact. I am visiting MONTA again for MDW (Memorial Day Weekend) I am coming back. It wouldn't be a successful Vegas trip without a visit to Monta. Seriously best Ramen in town.",

    "text": "Monta Ramen is one of the best ramen spots in Las Vegas. Is it the best in town? Maybe...  My order I always get is the Tonkotsu Ramen + extra Chashu + Nitamago + Corn  Sometimes I order Gyoza, sometimes Fried Rice, sometimes both. Depends on how hungry I am.  Everything is done well and if you need more heat just add chili powder.  What sets Monta apart from the rest is their Chashu. I don't really fuck with pork but their Chashu just melts with good buttery & rich flavor. The broth can get heavy but their must be an egg in every Japanese hot noodle dish.  The spot is like how a ramen spot should be. Limited spacing with more seats at the bar than tables. You get in and get out (if no wait time) in 30 mins...  When it comes to Japanese food I'm a harsh critic because the times I've been to Tokyo and my mom's cooking  Overall it's maybe the best in town as I've converted non ramen lovers into lovers of ramen...if you haven't been go for sure!",

The seating is very limited so be prepared to wait a bit.   The tonkotsu shoyu ramen is my absolute favorite. The portion size is great, especially considering you're only paying $7-8. The fried rice is my wife's favorite, and I have to say it's probably the best fried rice I've had in town.   I just wish they had refillable soda instead of only cans. The A/ unit isn't greatest either, so you can imagine how hot it can get when eating hot soup in a hot room. I always liked my food a little salty but sweating into my food isn't how I like it.",

    "text": "Everyone around me loves Monta but believe it or not the first time I tried it was just a few months ago. It was quite a bit of an acquired taste to me. When I first tried it I got a tonkatsu ramen and I hated it! It was too rich and too porky for me and I found myself wanting pho instead HAHA but oddly enough I started craving it a couple weeks after!   Now I get the tonkatsu-shoyu with all the fixings except the greens with a side of kimchi! I always find myself thinking the noodle to soup ratio is off, I need more soup!!!! I always make sure to get the thinner noodles because they taste better! Sometimes the broth is way too salty and sometimes I leave feeling like I just drank a bunch of pork fat but I keep going back, it's strangely addicting LOL   The gyoza and kimchi fried rice are good but nothing too special~   The negative is that It's a really small restaurant and their AC is not the best. There's most likely always a wait. So in order to keep the flow going please be courteous and eat your ramen and leave! This is not a place to lolly-gag after you're done eating, quickly give up your table to the next hungry group or suffer the consequence of angry looks!!!!! LOL   Hot Tip: If you don't want to wait go at really odd times like 3:00-5:00; there's usually never a wait~",

We had to wait for about 30-40 minutes for a table...the place is tiny, and packed full of people happily enjoying the ramen and other deliciousness.  We had the shoyu (chicken broth with thick wavy noodles), tonkotsu shoyu (pork and chicken broth with thin noodles), and the kuro (pork broth with a garlic oil).    All three were good, although I think I like the shoyu better.  Mine (tonkotsu shoyo) was great at first, but the more I ate, the saltier it tasted.  Being on a limited sodium plan, it was a little much for me, but it was still delicious.  The kuro was good, but it was better with the thicker noodles.   Service was quick and polite.   I really enjoyed my first ramen bar, and look forward to going back again.",

So we hopped in an Uber ride from the strip, about 15 minutes away. When we got there, I guess we weren't the only ones that wanted ramen in 100 degree heat. There was a 15 minute wait in a small restaurant with AC. (OMG THANK YOU)  The menu itself isn't all that fancy. There's only a small selection of different types of food. My nephew and I both ordered ramen and shared a kimchi fried rice. The ramen was pretty good and it had a very clean and flavorful broth. We slurped away at it and just took bites at the kimchi fried rice. The fried rice was amazing and if I had the choice, I would probably just go back for that instead of the ramen.   Service was pretty good considering there were two servers working about 8-10 tables and a handful of bar seats. The prices are very reasonable, and happy to have spent that instead of paying an outrageous amount somewhere on the strip.   I guess for Vegas it's not that bad. I've definitely had better ramen in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Was it worth the trip from the strip? Sure why not.",

The line was long and it was \"The blah-blah place\".Their service was letting you go into the house, put your name and how many people are you going to eat with(including you), where you're going to sit and wait outside. But when I looked inside, the restraunt was really small. So there are two improvements so far: space; the line should be indoors.        The line now wasn't long, but still took a long time. I was groaning and couldn't urge to say a thing. When about 40 min later. My mom heard our names and we burst into the seating area and sat on our seats before the waiter made a sound. We got water, but the table was a bit unstable and spilled some of my water, I tried to clean it up. However, it spilled again and it was bigger this time. So I repeated my work. The waiter soon came back to us and got our order. While we waited, I investigate. There was a bar near us, and there was only one plant. The wall had decorations for Christmas. The only \"upside\" was music, but not asian music.       As quick as a bunny we got our meals. The Japanese ramen looks exactly like the Korean ones if you turn the soup into red. The soup tastes good. I ordered the Tonkotsu, so the meat obviously is the gift from God. The problem is, the noodles should be slick because the noodles were too chewy. We also got dumplings, which was a celebrity of nutrition(too many idioms!!!). I wasn't too pleased but it was worth it. We ate for 5 to 10 min and we walked off, thinking which restraunt to go next...",

When going here, expect a little bit of a wait time because it's always packed which I understand and am okay with. However, I really dislike that it's way too crowded inside and there's not much space to move around. I hate that you're not even an arm's reach away from the next table.  What they lack in space though they make up for with food. I really like the base of their tonkasu ramen; it's not bland and it's not too salty, just the right amount for my taste. I also like getting their friend rice here as it taste very fresh, filling but not too heavy. Service is alright here, nothing too remarkable.  As far as ramen is concerned, I definitely recommend this place as one of my top 2.",

Their broth is so flavorful and is the best recovery food after a weekend of partying. The tradition is eating this Sunday before heading back to reality lol.   I have always gotten their to spicy tonkotsu. I recommend getting additional shredded green onion and soft boiled egg. I've tasted my friends' broths and they're all really good too: spicy miso (can't go wrong, not heavy), black garlic (very garlicky! But so delicious. It's more rich than the other soups, just a warning), shoyu (simple yet fulfilling).  The last time we went (3 days ago) we ordered the pork bowl, and it was pretty bomb.    Just a warning as far as the actual space. It is small. There are only about 4 4-person tables (which of course they can split for a 2-person table if needed) and their counter. Sooo with that being said, sometimes they do have a line out the door and wait can vary. The last few times I have been, we've gotten 30 mins prior to opening and were seated right away. This is not a place you will enjoy waiting for if you're extremely hungry (unless you know the end result which is of course is DELICIOUSNESS IN A BOWL THAT IS ACTUALLY WAITING FOR YOU SO JUST KNOW THAT THE WAIT IS WORTH EVERY SECOND)  Special shout out to Kung Fu Tea next door. Go there after of you're craving something sweet!",

We ordered: tonkotsu + egg and corn Miso + egg and extra Chashu  Small pork belly bowl (based on yelp raves)  Everything was delicious and the restaurant didn't disappoint. The pork belly bowl was a hit and was polished off very quickly.  It comes with some kind of pickled vegetable that was a hit. Both broths were thick and flavorful. Not salty. The pork chashu was tender and tasty.  Our only issue was that the broth was in a separate container from the other ingredients, and it wasn't labeled. So we weren't exactly sure which broth was which.   Can't want to try this restaurant in house",

The overall quality of the ramen is decent, though I find the shoyu ramen to be a bit on the saltier side. The extra toppings can be a bit expensive. The gyoza was okay.   The price is a bit more than what I expected of the quality. It may be attributed to the fact that we ate out of plastic containers. Compartively speaking, there are probably other food options that are just as good without the wait.",

Luckily, I learned that Monta offered chicken broth (hallelujah!!), when the broth is usually pork based. Nice and salty- just the way I like it. I always ask for thick noodles and it's delicious and affordable. My boyfriend enjoys the charsiu (although insists that Sora's meat is better).  This is my go-to suggestion when someone is wanting ramen.  The unfortunate thing about Monta is that there's always a bit of a wait because there is a line. This is especially True when it is dinner time!  But you know it's good when there's a line. Inside is tightly packed and crowded. You eat and go. And parking may be a bit tricky since this whole shopping area is busy with awesome restaurants. Park across the street near to the church.",

My friend and I were really hungry so we ordered gyoza and a small pork belly bowl to share. We also each ordered a bowl of ramen.

    "text": "THE BEST RAMEN IN VEGAS!  As someone who's lived in Vegas for over 17 years, I've frequented many different ramen shops. Monta is by far the best. Super simple, super modern, fast, delicious, exquisite.   I've been visiting Monta for years now, and it's still just as good as ever. The broth that Monta concocts has such a deep, tremendous flavor, and this is really where they shine. Monta features Tonkatsu (pork), Shoyu (soy), Tonkatsu Shoyu, and Miso, but they also have specialty ramen like garlic Kuro ramen, as well as spicy Tonkatsu ramen. It's cheap and delicious. You can also load your ramen with toppings ranging from kimchi to corn for an up-charge. I personally prefer to add extra Kikurage (mushroom) to my Ramen. And it's only $1.50 for extra noodles!  If you're looking for more than just ramen, I'd highly recommend the fried rice and the gyoza. The fried rice is out of this world, and the gyoza are extremely addicting and some of the best I've had. It's not uncommon for my friends and I to order several servings of the gyoza in a single sitting.   With the Spring Mountain location being in the heart of Chinatown and not too far from The Strip, the peak hours can manifest massive wait times. Monta has a tiny footprint, only seating about 30 people at a time, so keep that in mind if you're planning on visiting on a Friday or Saturday evening. However, you can usually always get a seat of you visit during off-peak hours; afternoons in the middle of the week are usually best.   Overall, I'll be visiting Monta and slurping their delicious noodles until I die from ramen overload. This is some good f***ing ramen, and once you go Monta, you'll ALWAYS go back.",

My cousin said she that she had the perfect hang over cure. \"Jamba Juice?\" I groaned painfully. \"No, we're going to Monta.\" The thought of food made my stomach churn. We walked in and were seated at one of the bigger tables. I made it a point to sit next to the wall so I can rest my head. I asked for a hot tea, and alas they serve no hot drinks. Sorry, one star off for that one. I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen. Even just the smell of the broth was oh so soothing - I felt my headache fade away with every slurp of the soup and ramen. From my understanding, they put great care into their broth by letting it boil down for hours. It is creamy, salty, and hot. Essentially, a perfect cap to a crazy night. The noodles were quite delicious too - it was slightly crispy and went very well with the soup. Tonkatsu comes with two pork pieces. You can order extra sides to put in your ramen (I felt like corn that day), but they do charge you. I also had a side order of fried rice, which I thought was very salty. It is good, but it needs something to offset the saltiness. The service was also prompt, and our server was quite cheery and polite.  The boys at our table kept mentioning how cute she was too.",

    "text": "Outstanding food ! The fried rice was particularly amazing -- better than any typical \"Chinese restaurant\" fried rice. Outstanding flavor. I loved my shoyu ramen - very flavorful and not as salty as I feared. I spiced it up a bit with the spices on the table. Dining companions tried the gyoza (dumplings) and enjoyed them. Reasonable prices and excellent, speedy service. Small place with very few tables and counter service so arrive early or late,as you will probably have to wait otherwise.  I dined with two big eaters and they were full at the end of the meal, sharing a fried rice a gyoza and each having their own ramen. (Note that the regular-sized fried rice was not as big as expected, but not to be missed)  WARNING: Not many , if any, healthy options on the menu that I saw - so save some calorie real estate for a great dining experience at the casual Monta - well worth it!  I skipped the gyoza, had just a bite of the rice and gave one of my dining companions some of my noodles and still -- I was content!",

We got there around 10pm on a Friday night and the parking lot was jam packed, with some crazy drivers circling round and round for a space.  Friend got in sooner than I did and found two seats at the counter, but she was hassled a bit by the server she called the soup Nazi, who demanded to know how much longer before I showed up.  (I was parking for goodness sake.)  People were starting to line up outside the door, it's such a tiny place.  We both ordered to tonkatsu ramen, mine with butter and corn, which added to the rich broth.  I keep forgetting to tell them to hold the bamboo shoots.  The chashu was tasty, but just a bit on the chewy side and it's worthy of a youtube video to see me try to separate it with my hashi or do the bite and yank technique while slurping the noodles and broth.  Fun experience pretending we were in a Japan noodle house. We'll go back to try a different broth and see if the chashu is more tender earlier in the day.",

She ordered the tonkatsu ramen and I ordered the chashu bowl.  The chashu bowl comes topped with nori, and the next day when I ordered takeout I definitely asked for it to be left off.  BUT the chashu is almost perfect - melty and tender on your tongue with the sweet soy-laced warm rice.  The only places I've had better chashu was in Japan and at a specific restaurant in the Bay Area, CA.  I tried the ramen, and it's good though too salty for my tastes.  The chashu bowl was worth driving out for though, and the next time we are in Vegas we will definitely stop by.",

I love the tonkotsu ramen with the nitamago and i add the grated garlic. Sooo good. The soup is thicker than the other ramens they have there. I had a thicker soup before @ tenkaippin in Oahu. But the tonkotsu is nice and salty, noodles are thin which I wish was a little bit fatter. I guess I like soggy noodles? But anyway they have toppings like chashu, green onion, bamboo, etc that's automatically on there. Omg chashu melts in your mouth! I always add the nitamago and sometimes corn. I've never had nitamago til I came to this place and I have to say that I love it!! I just love that first bite in to the noodles and then chashu and then nitamago. oh and their fried rice is awesome too! Service is fast and they are all so nice. I would actually rate this place 4.5",

Service was ok. Nothing exceptional, but not rude either. Portion is kinda small but I usually eat noodles with something else anyways, so it worked out just fine. I really liked fried rice there... more than noodles. Noodles was great, not the best I've ever had, but I was certainly happy.",

Never had been here before and we just searched up a Ramen place to try (since our favorite ramen joint closed down) and I would have to say that Monta Ramen is probably our new favorite. Their menu is small and simple, which I like because then I don't have to sit there forever trying to decide which one I want to order. I was able to see what they have and decide what I wanted quickly. We ordered the Tonkatu Shoyu and added an egg (extra $1.00-$1.50) and it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yummy! We also ordered their fried rice and gyoza. All was delicious.   The only downfall I have is that it is such a small restaurant that many people enjoy going to, so if you're there on a busy night.... most likely there will be a wait for a while and you'll be stuck waiting outside. (No inside seating area, hardly)  It was definitely worth the wait for us though. We enjoyed eating here and will be back again for sure.",

Pretty much everything in this plaza is amazing. But Monta is The. Best. Ramen. In. Vegas.  I always get the half tonkatsu half shoyu ramen because I like a little more salt, and think the tonkatsu is just a tad too porky for me. I also get the thicker noodle because I like a little more chew. They offer various additional toppings here including green onion, butter (!), corn, nitamago, pickled mustard greens and the very very necessary extra order of chashu. Not necessary because the regular order comes with a stingy amount.. extra because you will never, ever have enough chashu.  At other ramen places I usually pick around the roasted pork, just not that into the flavor. But here, it melts away in your mouth. It's so tender it's hard to grab with your chopsticks sometimes because it'll just fall apart.  The kim chee fried rice here is solid, but nothing I'd go out of my way for. This version is just.. meh. Good but not great.  Monta is ALWAYS worth the wait.",

We were there 5 minutes before opening, joined the throng of people waiting to get in, and happily we were able to get seats at the bar immediately.

I was very happy with the service!  Waitstaff was friendly, efficient, and checked on us regularly, even with a completely full house.  I loved being able to sit at the bar and watch the food being prepared.  This is one area they have a leg up on Ramen Sora.  I ordered miso ramen with corn, butter, and soft cooked egg and Hubs had tonkotsu ramen with shredded green onion.  At first, I thought my broth was completely lacking in flavor and was so disappointed.  Turns out that all the flavor had settled into the bottom of the bowl.  A good stirring fixed the problem.  Wish I had realized that earlier!  LOL!  Hubs and I both felt that the pork was extremely fatty and the texture was just not good.    I suppose that if I had never had Ramen Sora, this might have been fine.  But I HAVE had it and I will be going back to our usual from now on.  At least I can say that I've now made an informed decision between the two rivals.  :)",

My husband got the tonkatsu ramen, had no idea it didn't come with an egg (everywhere we eat at they give you an egg) so that's odd.  Then we tried the soup, wayy too salty.  My husband added water, about half a cup to dilute it, tasted so much better.  There really is no service.  We sat down, ordered and paid and that's pretty much it.  Don't expect to much.  We came in with high expectations because of the reviews, but left disappointed and hungry!",

There are maybe four tables total (besides the bar).   As far as food goes, the menu is very simple. I had the miso, and my fiance had the tonkatsu. We ate with another friend, an all ordered pretty different toppings, which the waitress all put down in front of the wrong people. Not a big deal, but the server didn't seem to know what she was serving. The ramen was good, but honestly I'd prefer Ramen Tatsu (especially because of the wait time and size of restaurant).",

Veggies were yummy. Everyone around us was ordering extra-this or extra-that ... underscoring insufficient portion size. Taste was excellent.

I forget what the name was on the menu but it was so tasty.  It was packed with flavor when you eat.  It also had that refreshing taste to it.  You leave the restaurant, not sluggish, but having a refreshed feeling, which isn't normal.  Well to me at least! Great restaurant and open pretty late!   Space is small, so try to get there early.

    "text": "Oh my goodness. I was out here on vacation for a week and came back here twice because it was so good! Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen was my go-to both times.  It was my first time having authentic Ramen and it was delicious.  The pork, abundant in portion just melts in your mouth and the broth - my lord, the broth was creamy and rich and thick and so tasty.  The bowls were the perfect size too! My boyfriend and I joked that this is better than pho, but I put pho in a totally different category ;)   We came here around lunchtime during the weekday and on both occasions, there was about a 10-15 minute wait, but it's worth it guys! It's definitely easier if you're a single diner or just the two of you.  A party of 3 or more -- be prepared to wait.  The place was rather small so I got worried, but the staff are efficient and people are in and out.  We were seated at the counter closest to the kitchen, so it got pretty hot while waiting and eating our ramen, but it wasn't too bad.  For the amount you get and the absolute tastiness of everything -- it was worth every bit of wait and effort especially for being under $10 for a bowl.    I recently came back to DC and decided to try another ramen joint in the city and it didn't even come close.  Boyfriend and I were really disappointed because Monta Ramen has set the bar high for us and I cannot wait to come back to Vegas just for another bowl!   I definitely recommend this place if you're traveling or trying Ramen for the first time.  You will not regret it! The Spicy Tonkotsu wasn't even spicy for those who are hesitant  about the level of spice.  The dumplings were also delicious and fresh.  I miss you, Monta Ramen, and all the over delicious Asian eats in Vegas!",

By venturing a short distance away from the Las Vegas strip you hit Chinatown; lots of great food and memories of home (LA 626).   I do have to warn you that wait time is over an hour long. People don't mind, they usually hop over to Kung Fu Tea to get their boba fix while waiting. Just know that if your name on the wait list is called and you're not there; they will skip you and move on to the next.  After waiting an hour we decided to change our dine in request to take out. Take out is 15 to 20 minutes. Much faster.  We get our food and head back to the strip to eat. The food was filling and delicious. For your classic ramen of just cha shu, seaweed, broth, and ramen it was a very good deal. FYI, you can order extra noodles if you're super hungry and want to eat more noodles.   Highly recommend checking out the Las Vegas Chinatown area (for good food and grocery shopping). The food here seems less expensive.",

Summary: it's a pretty cute little ramen house. I wasn't rly hungry to begin with but my mom wanted to meet up so I was like aight that's fine. The wait for the ramen is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO short. Like it came out almost instantly. I kinda forgot what ramen I got, but it was good. Oh actually it might've been the miso and something ramen. Anyways, it wasn't too salty which is always good. The noodles were so yummy. They had different size noodles which is pretty epic if I do say so myself. And in conclusion you should definitely come here. It's a little cramped but the more the merrier I guess.",

When we walked in, there was a tiny waiting area, a hostess stand to write your name down and about 15-20 seats (including the bar).   The menu was simple but to the point and I liked that, I have never been to a ramen shop before so this was cool. They had four or five different ramens to choose from and then about 10 things that you can add to it. I just did the basic ramen and added scallions to it. My boss also ordered a side of Kim Chi rice.   The food came less than ten minutes later nice and hot and smelling delicious! The rice.......I do not like kim chi but this rice was so flavorful and tasty that I went in for seconds.  My ramen was so good, the complexity of the broth was insane!   Throughout our meal the restaurant stayed busy and with people lining up outside. It is a popular place in China Town and I was finally able to find out why. I have told anyone that I can about my experience with Monta Ramen and can't wait to come back. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

I've heard about the horrible wait times and I can see why.  The restaurant is small!  We were seated at the counter by the door and that was the best seat because the AC unit was just above us.  I can't stand eating ramen while sweating.    I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and the broth was lukewarm and extremely salty.  The basic ramen comes with chashu, kikurage, bamboo shoots and green onions.  I added an egg and corn and they do not skimp on the corn.  Holy Moly!  I'm not complaining though!  I also tried the fried rice and that was good.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that there is nothing inherently wrong with the ramen at Monta but after eating at Ramen Sora and even Jinya, this place didn't really cut it for me.  I got exactly what I get at those two locations just so I could easily compare.  I got the shoyu ramen with extra noodles and the pork belly bowl.  Starting off with the pork belly bowl, this was really the star for me.  The pork was so tender and flavorful!  It was marinated in soy and had chopped pickled ginger on top which only added to the flavor.  I will say that this narrowly beats the chashu bowl and Ramen Sora.  I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't order an extra large bowl of ramen so I settled for an extra side of noodles.  The flavor of the broth was good but seemed to be lacking in flavor and didn't seem to have the same fat content as others I have tried.  Fat = Flavor!  The pork also seemed to be leaner and tougher than I would have liked.  The extra noodles were hard to add as they all stuck together in one mass so I decided to just dump them in but there wasn't extra broth added to compensate for the extra noodles.    Overall this wasn't a waste and I'm glad I tried it.  I now don't have to worry about what I was missing and if there was something better out there than my go to.  The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  Let's just call this a learning experience.",

    "text": "Monta is probably one of the best available ramen places available in Vegas besides Momofuku but the wait is always horrendous.  My last visit my wife and I arrived on a Monday morning 10 minutes before the restaurant opened up and the line was already over the restaurants capacity.  My wife and I were pretty lucky to have only a party of two but for those with 4 or more had no choice but to wait for the 4 available quad seater tables.  The two types of ramen I usually choose between is the spicy miso ramen and the black garlic oil ramen.  Both ramen have a very thick and flavorful broth but my only gripe is that they don't always come out piping hot like it should, and I always feel like there is not enough broth.  The noodles have a good chew to them and the chashu is nice fatty and melts in your mouth delicious.    This is not a place for large parties more than 4, and if you are in a rush I would not even bother.",

Service is speedy, food is flavorful, and the prices can't be beat. On this particular day I had the black garlic oil ramen.  I thought it was good. Nothing to go wild over.  Not sure if that's how it's supposed to taste, but it was like they overcooked the garlic that made it have a strong bitter flavor.  They've been at this location for a long time, which is small often making it have long waits. I did have their fried rice and that was delicious!  I think I may just not be a ramen person because I leave here without really wanting to come back and try more. It is definitely worth trying if you are indeed a ramen fan, however :)",

I love the broth and thin style noodles. Aside from the excellent ramen Monta offers great side dishes.   I invite others to find there staple and enjoy ramen restaurant hunting.

    "text": "Always a favorite when I'm in the area.  Their ramen is as legit as can be and I've had ramen in Tokyo and Niseko Japan.    Location: Located in the Chinatown area of Las Vegas in a tiny mini mall-like complex.  Parking can be difficult if you come during peak hours as the small complex has a few other restaurants that are also very popular.  The restaurant is on the smaller side.  I think they might fit less than 30 people in the restaurant at any one time so be prepared to wait if you go during peak eating hours.  Also note that this place does NOT have AC so on really hot days in Vegas, it's WARM in the restaurant and eating a hot bowl of ramen on a hot day might not be for everyone.    Staff: The staff is quick but I'm guessing it's because they're trying to get people through their meals as efficiently as possible since there seems to always be a line waiting to be seated. Don't get me wrong, it's not like they rush you; I've never felt rushed when I eat here.   Food:  I love their ramen; I normally order shoyu ramen when I eat ramen.  The broth is rich and flavorful.  The char-siu is tender and also holds a lot of flavor.  I don't know if the noodles are handmade onsite or not; it didn't look like they were and I didn't ask.  The noodles had the perfect texture of chewiness.    Totally worth coming to if you are willing to be patient (especially in the heat of summer).",

Not ideal for large groups.   Ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen  -Comes with a few slices of chasu pork in a thick creamy pork broth - The chasu slices were good and the thin ramen noodles was good but not mind blowing because it's NOT freshly made by them there  - This thick broth was too salty for my liking and so I had to ask for some hot water to dilute it   Note: The ramen does not come with any toppings so best to add an egg, corn, and seaweed. But DO NOT order the pickled mustard greens because it's way too salty and a waste of your money.",

Luckily, the bar had two open seats for my friend and I.  Thinking with our appetites, we began the order:  2 Tonkotsu Ramen (this is what they're known for) 1 Gyoza (it's gyoza and I was hungover, so give me a break) 1 Kimchi fried rice (once again, we were hungover!)  After taking the last bite and having to unbutton my pants, I looked at my friend and gave him the approving nod, which summed up our experience.",

    "text": "we ate here twice in 3 days! the first time we actually came to eat at the snowflake shavery for dessert, but noticed the crowd milling around monta and decided to throw our name on the waiting list. since we had our baby in tow, we weren't exactly expecting to wait it out. however, the woman working at monta was so incredibly nice, she save us a table and made it as comfortable as possible for the baby, even helping us store the stroller in the back! now to be honest we weren't incredibly hungry after the wonderful shavery but we managed to still enjoy my tonkotsu and shoyu ramen with the egg and my wife the black garlic oil flavored kuro ramen. I've definitely had better egg in my time so next time I'd try some other add on.  while the food was good, the service was what stuck in our minds that first night. nicest wait staff ever! we also vowed to take my noodle loving 10 year old nephew and my sister when they rolled into town the next day.    so today we went around lunch time, and longer line so again we hit the snowflake shavery first! while waiting, we saw the flyer that they opened a monta in henderson! we'll definitely try that next. This time the wait was longer and we worked up our post-snow appetites...and score! the nephew and sister loved it! also i tried the takana fried rice this time which I thought was great. Just the right amount of spiciness and with the mustard green, unique from chinese fried rice. my better half had the shoyu ramen this time, which was indeed lighter than the tonkotsu broth. I think I preferred the tonkotsu but it was good to have tried them both.  next stop will definitely be the one near my parents house on eastern. thanks yelp for the recommendation!",

    "text": "One of my Vegas staples.  My friend took me here a few years ago, and I've been addicted ever since.  I usually order the Tonkatsu with corn and two eggs.  The broth is savory and the Gyoza is delightfully crispy!  The noodles are cooked to the perfect chewiness.  Monta is extremely small, so do not bring anymore than four people here.  If you're lucky, you'll get a table, but most of the time, you end up sitting at the counter (which is still cool because then you get to watch the chefs cook the noodles).    The food is yummy and the price tag is inexpensive = VALUE GALORE... Oh, and the service is always amazing.  The only catch? - Bring cash, because they don't take credit cards for bills under $10.00.    Go here. Just... Go.  I promise you will not regret it.  Slurrrrrrrrrp!",

I came when they opened and there was already a line out the door so I had high expectations.  I had the: - Tonkotsu shoyu ramen (which has both pork and chicken broth). The broth was lacking.  It's salty but isn't rich.  The flavors are subtle compared to other places like Fukumimi, Daikokuya, and Men Oh Tokushima. ..and the egg in the ramen is a side option, so if you don't order it you won't get it.  The noodles were really different too.  They didn't seem like they were made from scratch.  Whatever it is, it's not what you typically have in ramen.  Also, the chaysu is pretty fatty so if you're looking to get some meat or protein in, you're almost forced to order something else.. or something else on the side! - Gyoza.  All 6 pieces were stuck together.  It really just looked like a whole bunch of frozen pieces were thrown in a pot so I wasn't too impressed - but they were YUMMY!    This place may be good, but maybe for things other than their ramen.",

I had the tonkotsu - shoyu with extra meat and an egg.  Also, an order of Goyza.  The pork was so good - it was tender and delish!  The broth was savory.  I would have liked to see more noodles in the soup, but hey...  Lotsa flavor and texture.  The goyza was good too.  It is a small place.  They have 28 seats jammed in there!  They turn some tables here, so don't go there thinking you are going to sit back and relax.    I guess semantically this is a fast food place because you get food fast and you even eat the food fast!  But it is not fast food that you normally think of.  I would say that this is real good fast food.",

    "text": "I use Yelp often but I've never written a review before. However, I was so disappointed by my last visit at Monta that I feel like there needs to be some sort of review on the service. I have here many times because their food is good...not just good, but craveable. It's also a good value for the price and it never takes long to cook.   But that's not the problem at Monta. The problem is the service or lack of thereof. I visited today, April 28th, 2017 around 1pm. There were two cooks on, two servers, and all seats were filled. Everyone had their food and nothing was being cooked. I put my name on the list. A lady that was waiting before me kept looking around. After a few minutes she left, looking distraught. No one greeted us. I tried several times to catch the attention of the younger waitress but she kept looking away. I sat down. Stood up. Tried speaking to her when she was three inches away from me and refilling waters. She ignored me. I understand if this place is busy that she might not have the time, but she did. The cooks were cooking a thing. Everyone was eating. Not even a hello. All I wanted to do was order food to go. Finally I literally stared here straight across the room and said \"excuse me.\" She came over with reluctance like I was going to ask her why I couldn't have a seat sooner. When I said I wanted to order to-do she immediately took my order. I was out of there in less than 5 minutes from this point.  Just remember, people come for the food but return for service.   On one of my last visits I witnessed another young waitress scream at a patron who had ordered over the phone. She confirmed her order with him but he said he ordered something different. He did seem very confused but she basically humiliated him in front of the whole restaurant. She changed his order for him but said that the price would not change. I understand that this is frustrating as someone who works both a job in customer service and a second job in the restaurant industry. But this is no way to handle a simply fixable mistake.  I am simply giving feedback as a customer on my experience. This place with continue to be successful because of it's delicious food. As for me, I will look elsewhere for my ramen. I will stop recommending this place to my friends. Las Vegas has countless restaurants, why should I go somewhere where I feel unwelcomed and hassled? To me, that is not worth one very good bowl of noodles.",

They refuse to park your car ... And my favorite, their Tonkotsu broth is so thick & creamy you can't even drink it ...  10 reasons I hope not to see your there ...",

    "text": "Came here right when they opened at 11:30am and the place was already PACKED. Our group of four grabbed the last available seats out of the 27 total they have.  We ordered a side of kimchi ($1!), kimchi fried rice (5/5), gyozas (3/5), Pork Belly Bowl (2/5), and Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen (3/5). The best thing here is the kimchi fried rice and if you like either kimchi or rice or both, you should definitely get this plate! It's flavorful without being overbearing and it adds a nice variety if you're ordering ramen.  The Pork Belly Bowl was sooo sooo bland. It looks much better than it tasted, and throughout eating my bowl, I kept having to add spice and soy sauce. The chef kept looking at me do so and I felt a bit guilty since I'd think it's pretty offensive that I'm altering his dish as much as I did, but I HAD to.   The ramen was mediocre and didn't meet its hype. We paid an extra $1 for spicy paste, but still felt like it was lacking. We do live in Los Angeles where there are many fine ramen establishments, so it gave this place a disadvantage as we were comparing what we had had in LA to what was available here the whole time.  Thankfully we didn't have to wait or else I would've docked another star off this review.",

Kuro ramen (black garlic oil)- pork based broth that comes with chasu, bamboo, black mushrooms, and scallions.  I added an egg for $1.50.  The broth was good but the flavor isn't as rich as other ramen places.  I wasn't a fan of the straight ramen noodles.    Spicy Tonkotsu- the hubs got this and he said it was \"pretty good\".  Pork based broth and they give you a spoonful of some spicy paste on top of the ramen.  Relatively inexpensive meal but I didn't think the ramen was spectacular.  I'm probably spoiled by all the great ramen spots in LA!",

The tonkotsu soup was slightly oily and not as hearty or tasty as Tenkaippin kotteri ramen (#1 on my list).  Still, it is very good and I'm glad we stopped in.  I also had the mentaiko side dish, very good and very cheap.  Go check it out next time you're on the ninth island!",

It is awesome. The fried rice is out of the park good.  The bowls of noodles are quite big and you pay like $7 bucks. You can't go wrong with that.  The wait staff is nice and fast.  I can eat here everyday since Ramen noodles are one of my favorite.  It is a bit out of the way for me plus its small and often packed.

Listen, its small, but there's a secret! If you come by yourself during lunch-hour you can usually find a single seat at the bar!    If you've never been to Monta, the tonkatsu ramen is like chicken noodle soup on steroids, except its pork noodle soup! It's literally the deepest, most intense pork flavor ever!   As good as this place is, its like 3 times better when its a little chilly outside, really makes it hit the spot.  PS. Get the egg. And when you get your ramen, flip the egg (which is cold) over, yolk down, for a few mins, soaking in the hot broth!",

My brother and bf were hesitant to go because they've had not so good ramen before but both of them loved the ramen they ordered (tonkotsu and shoyu).  My brother loved it so much, he went again 2 days later.  I'll definitely be going back again and again for the ramen!  And next time, I'll try the extra toppings..but it says a lot about the flavor of the soup when I loved it plain the way it came.  So why the 4 stars?  We also ordered kimchi fried rice and the dumplings.  The dumplings were ok, nothing special about it.  It came slightly burnt and were all stuck together.  The kimchi fried rice was ok too, but more sour than the normal ones I've had.    Stick to the ramen and you'll love this place!",

    "text": "I have eaten here before and the food is good so we were excited to come for a friend's birthday dinner. My boyfriend and I got there first and put down for a table of 5. About 15 mins later they set a table for us but our entire party was not there so they refused to seat us. We told them that one person was in the lot trying to find a spot (another negative about this spot - no parking) and the other 2 were less than 5 minutes away. We asked if my boyfriend and I could be sat and order apps as we were starving. The waitress said she could not seat us until the whole party was there as it would be unfair to other ppl waiting?! She said if we wanted to eat we could sit separately (lovely - you see me with a gift bag but tell us we could sit separately). I asked what sense did that make when we're waiting for others. She said it didn't matter it's their policy. So we sat and stared at our table of 5 waiting for us as the waitress complained about us to the chefs and rolled her eyes at us every time she looked at us. As our friends were  still trying to find a spot we asked again if we could be sat and begin ordering. Verily nastily she said - are you going to order for 5?? My boyfriend said no why?? Everyone's more or less here. At this point I was just done with this place so I said let's leave and find somewhere else and walked out. My boyfriend asked the waitress are you really willing to let a table of 5 leave when ppl are ready to order and the others are trying to find parking in a lot that has no spots?? The waitress turned and walked away without saying anything.  We left and went to Ramen Sora (about a block away) where there's ample parking and better service.",

The ramen was tasty, the fried rice was just ok, considering the price for what you get, but the rock star of the meal was def the pork belly rice!  I wish we would have not ordered the fried rice and just gotten the PBR!!  It reminded me of my childhood and it was sooooo good!  In fact, I want some now thinking of it! :)  I'll be back just for that!  The place is small tho and even tho we arrived around 4 it was still a 15 min. wait for a table.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean.  But the  most important thing is order the PBR!! :)",

We had a waitress take a look at it and we were told that it's just a mushroom. We asked to take a CLOSER look and they admitted that it was a bug. They asked us if we wanted replacement which was a little odd to us(who wants to keep the Ramen with the bug in it???). We were also told that it comes with food and on top of that, what we got after all this was 50% off on that Ramen and all they said to us was \"Sorry about that\". I was disappointed with their service even though their food is loved by lots of people..... Even though it wasn't only the server's fault, one's fault is everyone's fault as a team/restaurant member....",

The chef claim you couldn't get the ingredient/recipe here and it came straight from Japan.  The noodle is very tasty.  Few things I don't like about the the Ramen is that the soup is got way too much oil in there which is not drinkable.  If you are looking for restaurant to socialize with your friends, this is definitely not the spot for you.  The turn over is very fast, people Eat and Go quick and you have people wait in line in a very small space and everyone will be staring at you waiting LOL...  Not a spot to hang out.

However, I keep coming back for more since this is pretty much the only legitimate ramen shop that I know of in the Las Vegas Valley area.  I usually order the miso ramen with nitamago, shredded green onions, and corn (sometimes I go wild and order butter too).  The broth is on the fattier side, and is rich and nutty.  Overall, this is a good bowl of ramen.  Service is friendly and quick and their streamlined menu captures all the quintessential components of your basic ramen shop.",

I didn't care because I had to get my ramen fix on, and this place is supposed to be the best in town! 1st impressions are good; as the wait list was organized and simple. While waiting, I checked out the menu. Straight forward, delicious sounding dishes/ bowls and sides. I also noticed that the menu is more limited than the Monta Ramen in Henderson (Eastern Ave/ Serene). Not full menu of appetizers... So at about 1 pm on a Tuesday afternoon, we waited 10 minutes.  Not bad, but I think we got lucky. I ordered the Tonkotsu...added the egg for a little over a buck...and it didn't disappoint!  The broth was flavorful (not just a sodium bomb) and the noodles were just what you'd expect a good noodle shop would produce.  Did I mention the price? $6.95 for bowl.  So good; and hit the spot for my craving. Check this place out if you yearn for good ramen. You won't be disappointed!!",

    "text": "Finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in Vegas - Monta Noodle House.  Conveniently located on Spring Mountain, right next to the super busy Raku.  (Smart business choice I would say.)  This place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  Their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (A couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)  I went for their most popular dish - Tonkotsu Ramen ($6.95).  The main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  This results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  It automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and green onions.  Their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the Chinese kind, but definitely tasty.  The Husband went for the Miso Ramen ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  This was also good, and quite filling.  We also shared a regular order of the Pork Belly Bowl ($5.75).  It sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  I adore pork belly and the next time I come here, I'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  It's fatty and good.    A side dish we added on was the Takana Mustard Leaf ($1.50).  You can have this on the side or in your broth.  It's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  It's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  Other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or green onions.  There's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - Shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  You can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"Kaedama.\"  Other dishes available are gyoza, fried rice, kim chee fried rice, takana fried rice, cha siu bowl, and mini mentaiko (marinated polluck roe).  Service was good.  With two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  It's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.  Update!   I returned the following month for my own bowl of the Pork Belly Bowl.  This time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  Guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.",

    "text": "Now that I've come here enough to practically remember the whole menu, I think it's ready for a review.   When I found this place (through Yelp of course) I thought to myself, \"Could it be? A True authentic ramen place that the city I originally resided in devastatingly lacked of? My own little NYC Momofuku only a 15 minute drive away?\" OH, SWEET BABY JESUS IT COULD!   Before making the trip to your next lunch or dinner date here, you should probably consider what day you're going and at what time. This place is SMALL, like 5 tables (2 4-tops, 3 2-tops) small with a couple seats at the bar, and it gets crazy packed! The first time I came here I literally drove by and was like, \"awh hailll noo,\" and drove away. HOWEVER I will say that if there's just a couple of people before you, just be patient and wait. The tables turn over rather quickly.  Which leads me to the menu. It's very simple and quick to prepare. If you're going with ramen, they have 4 different broth options: Shoyu (chicken), Tonkotsu (pork), Tonkotsu-shoyu (chicken & pork) and Miso. All are priced around 6.95 a bowl. Just forget the rest and go with the Tonkotsu-Shoyu. All ramens are prepared with two slices of pork, bamboo, and chopped green onion. Don't forget to add extra ingredients like an egg and mustard leaf! If you've never tried mustard leaf, it really compliments the broth and makes it extra delicious...order it on the side and try it out! Adding in the ingredients is what really gets the meal to be pricier than expected. Just 1 egg is an extra $1.75, but it's okay to indulge a little every now  and then, so just go all out with you bad ramen self!   They have other items as well such as fried rice, small plates, and cold ramen! I still have yet to try them.. will do an update after my next visit!   The only negative thing I'd have to say about the ramen is it can get pretty salty, of course you can mention to them less sodium, but I'm pretty sure all they're going to do is dilute it with hot water. To leave it on a positive note, aside from the saltiness the broth is PERFECTION. Extremely murky, so you know its packed with flavor and takes overnight cooking to prepare.",

The noodles were very fresh and the broth was perfectly seasoned. The dumplings were lightly fried and so delicious I couldn't stop eating them! I highly recommend monta. If you're looking for a place with great food, great prices and off the strip, this is the spot.",

I have tried the famous Ramen shop in LA, SF, and NYC.  This one is no doubt the  BEST.  Thick creamy soup with bald flavors.  Although I am not the fan of thin noodles but they managed to cook it right (Shinsengumi Hataka Ramen in Gardena can not get it right, so does the famous Ippudo in NYC).  I also LOVED their nitamago (soft broiled egg).  YUMMY (Look at the business photo that I placed)  This place is now on my official \"Must Visit\" place when coming to Sin City.  So Good!$!#$!$!  and they also accept credit cards :D",

    "text": "This is probably the most popular ramen restaurant near Las Vegas area because we had to wait about 1 hour just to get in. Restaurant was pretty small and service was okay.    Miso ramen with extra chashu porks and nitamago ($7.25 + $2.5 + $1.5) - The miso broth was a bit salty, but at least there was some flavor. Nitamago (flavored egg) was actually pretty good. Chashu porks had a good texture, but tasted a bit salty. I do like their wavy noodle, pretty chewy.   This place probably won't be this popular if it opens up around the Los Angeles area because there are too many great ramen restaurants. Overall - noodle wasn't too bad, but broth was definitely a bit salty.",

What came out to the table was tonkotsu ramen with garlic oil on the side. I immediately told the girl this is not what I ordered. She , in turn, went to get the original waitress who insisted this was what I ordered. Come on now , I know what I ordered and my friend heard me order it, too. Any establishment would have taken it back and replaced it with what i ordered. She refused. So now, my friends are halfway done with dinner so I said forget it and reluctantly ate the tonkotsu. So the bill comes and she charges me extra for the garlic oil. Wtf... So if you want to get your order right here have them repeat it before they take off.  I don't like tonkotsu ramen so I can't base my review on the food. Sorry",

We ordered the char siu rice bowl and shoyu ramen.  The food came quickly and smelled great.  Added the red ginger, sesame seeds, red pepper salt and crushed garlic.  It does add a boast.  The soup is tasty as were the noodles.  I don't eat pork so my hubby said it was very tender but sparse.  His bowl looked good with a small pile of seaweed on top of everything.  We enjoyed it but prefer pho to ramen so will visit Vietnamese places.",

    "text": "It is a tradition...and a MUST to eat some sort of noodle and soup combo after a long inebriated weekend in Las Vegas. Monta Ramen is one of my go-to spots upon exiting the city of sin.  Very small location, but huge flavors!  Get here early or you will be getting blue-balled by the aroma and presence of the MONTA RAMEN.  *Oh yes...if you need a place to hang out or wait...I suggest the bar across the plaza...$4 beers and video casino games kept me entertained.  When we sat down, they had 2 specials: Kuro Ramen and Spicy Tonkatsu. Both sounded absolutely amazing...it took me a while to figure out which bowl I should get...but I finally came to a conclusion within minutes. I ORDERED BOTH!  In addition, I also ordered a bowl of Pork Belly with rice and a nice Sapporo to go with the meal. Oh yes, how could I forget...GETTING AN EGG IS A MUST!  The food came out...everything was heavenly. The noodle was firm to an appropriate al dente - ramen style. The broth wasnt too thick where it came off as a sauce. Hearty, packed with immense flavor, and delicious. So delicious that all the asians DID NOT want to waste the extra effort and time to publish their food on facebook or instagramn.   My experience was great. The only thing that sucked was the 4 hour drive home to OC + food coma + food baby.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",

Also, even though it's a small place, it didn't feel cramped or stuffy. You had the choice of sitting at the bar or at a table - which made for a very chill eating experience.   I ordered the Gypza to start, set the stage for a wonderful meal. Then ordered the Shoyu Ramen which has both chicken and pork broth, thick noodles, pork belly, mushrooms and egg (extra). The ratio of noodle to broth was perfect and all ingredients complimented each other very well. The broth wasn't salty at all either - which was great!   My go to spot whenever I'm in town, hands down!",

    "text": "Never wrote a review on Monta before, and I certainly don't like writing bad reveiws unless I have a real personal bad rapport with the service, or, knowingly being \"stiffed\" out of more money for something not worthy or neccessary.  After \"Togoshi Ramen\" disappeared, Monta is probably the first real \"Ramen-ya\" (ramen house) opened in Las Vegas.  Not a sushi-ya or a restaurant serving ramen, or a ramen-ya being a full restaurant.  Monta's  Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen started good, and was good for awhile, and went to \"a little too salty\" on the ramen soup, but I know they can do better.   Went back today after more than a year, and it was back to normal. Still a small place, busy as usual, but, I was in and out in about 30 - 40min.  I ate pretty quick, too. I didn't order any extra toppings because I want it to taste it the way it is, plus, I ordered a side of pot stickers and a side of Kimchee Fried Rice.   It might be my imagination, but, I think their Kimchee Fried Rice got better.  I don't remember if it originally had any bits of shiitake mushrooms in it, but it had it, and it was delicious!   The gyoza (pot stickers)  I ordered (not in the photo) was a gyoza.  Nothing special.  Frankly, I've had better gyoza, and I can too, make a better one (with 30+ years of professional cooking and non-professional experience).  However, their specialy is ramen. Tonkotsu Shoyu is difficult to balance in the first place.  I can taste the pork broth with the shiitake mushrooms, and a hint of something... not Japanese.  May be Chinese, or perhaps that \"hihachi\" pepper from Okinawa?  Great job Monta!  Their other ramen like miso base and shoyu base have always been good. Ramen soups are always fascinating, because there are so many things you can do to it.  There is no \"fixed\" or \"Orthodox\" style, or, whatsoever.  It has to taste good at your first sip of the soup, hence, very challenging.  Furthermore, I've always loved the way their workers  are \"up beat\" and energetic, how a small and busy place like that should be.",

We were seated at a booth by the front door, which was a bench seat that spanned the length of the room and then 2 chairs on the other side. There was a bar and only a couple of other tables, so not great for big groups.  Noodles were chewy and on point! Black garlic ramen was amazing, the pork belly bowl definitely satisfied the kids. Since it was a hot hot day, full of driving, we ordered cold noodles with yuzu sauce!   Service was great!

I've only tried this place twice so far and every time they set my bowl of steamy hot miso/tonkatsu ramen with chashu and egg, a part of me rejoices.  Japanese chashu is normally tender, juicy, and melts in your mouth.  Monta's chashu doesn't disappoint.  Always get extra chashu!  The soup is full of flavor [although if you show up during the rush, it can become waaay too salty].  The over-cooked noodles is where they disappoint.  The establishment itself is very small and becomes packed fast.  Seating is limited and there always seems to be a line right when they open.  3.5 stars!",

A frequent patron here, my boyfriend and I have dedicated a weekly lunch date there - Monta Mondays :D Their Sapporo style miso ramen is awesome - chewy noodles, rich miso broth, and the perfect amount of toppings. Oh how heavenly it would be if they were to add crab to the topping extras!  Be sure to order a side of handmade gyoza, as well.  *They don't open until 11:30am.",

    "text": "Finally got to go to Monta after hearing about it for so long and dying to go. It was good! Pretty much what you would expect from a ramen place... quick and easy. It is very small and you'll probably have to wait for sure.   I have to say I enjoy different ramen styles better, though, like what they have at Ramen Sora. Monta has thinner noodles, and their broth is very good but doesn't have the umami punch that makes ramen so delicious. I prefer thicker, chewier wavy noodles than thin noodles that they had. They also do not have curry like many ramen places unfortunately, but that is okay, because they make up for it with their variety of fried rices.   I sat at a stool at the bar, and it is pretty uncomfortable, but adds to the ramen-ya feel that they are going for. I wouldn't mind going back, it definitely satisfies the ramen craving, but I think if I had to pick one place it would be Ramen Sora for sure.   Check it out!",

    "text": "I was first introduced to this place when my friends had asked if I wanted to try out the best ramen in Las Vegas.  At first I was hesitant seeing as I have had plenty of ramen in Vegas.  They are good but not what  I was expecting.  When he had said the name Monta, I was relieved to know that this was not a place I had previously eaten at which is surprising seeing as I have eaten at plenty of ramen places.  When pulling up into the lot you would have to look for it seeing as Monta is a pretty tiny place.  This is definitely one of those places where you would have to hear about.  One of those hole in the wall places.  Once you walk in you are greeted warmly by the staff and the cozy environment.  You can see the kitchen and the workers all hard at work trying to fill the mouths of its many customers.  One thing I have to say about this place, and I have eaten here many times, prepare to wait a bit for there is usually a line because of how delicious this place is.  Once seated there will be a small menu with now four types of ramen you can choose from.  A tonkotsu base ramen which is pork based, shoyu which is soy based, tonkotsu-shoyu which is a mix of the two, and miso which is bean paste based.  They also have side items which you can put into your ramen like corn and eggs which are a pretty much a must.  The portions are also very generous and you will get that good fill feeling.  I have personally eaten them all and can vouch for them all.  They are all so good.  Monta is like the In-N-Out of ramen.  They specialize in ramen and boy, do they deliver.  This is now one of the only ramen places I will go to eat.  A very cheap and delicious way to spend with friends or even eat at by yourself.  There are few places where I will eat by myself and this is for sure one of them.",

    "text": "The first time I came to Monta, there was a huge line coming out of Big Wong because of their Grand opening free meal special, and this gave me a pretty easy entry into Monta that day.  Even though a bunch of cheap skates were at Big Wong, this tiny dining room at  Monta was still almost filled to capacity, but still; I found a seat the the counter area.   The waitress was very impressive, and had it down on helping almost everyone in the dining room, while still taking care of take outs orders.  On the down side, looking how Monta menu is set up,  they have a nickel and dime effect on how you make an order with them.   Never  in my life I would thought of a eating a 12.00 bowl of Ramen which happen that day.  The Tonsoku stock was pretty good, and ramen could have been cooked a little bit longer, but the thought of paying extra for the corn, nori, boiled egg, and extra noodles kind of got to me.    Don't get me wrong,  I thought  Monta had  the best Tonsoku ramen in Las Vegas, because there wasn't any real competitors at that time.   My only thought going through my mind was if Monta had to match up with Ezogeku in Hawaii (which is pretty good)   This comparison would be like Godzilla battling Pee Wee Herman, because Ezogeku would  waste this place in a heartbeat for quality and value.  That's pretty sad to say a ramen-ya in Hawaii has a better overall package than this so-called Las Vegas heavyweight..   I never understood why anyone would wait two hours in line to eat  here, because currently  in Las Vegas there more than a few Ramen-ya that recently opened recently and all of them can trade punches with Monta.  In fact, I don't think this place has the best ramen in the Chinatown area, and for sure Monta isn't the best Japanese establishment in this shopping complex.   Take my advice, walk fifty step to the east in the parking lot, and go there.   Sorry Monta,  in my opinion your product doesn't justify the price and the time wasted.  Also, please take a lesson from your neighbor next door, and keep everything clean in the back room.  Getting nailed with a MAJOR health violations from the Southern Nevada Health District is quite an embarrassment.    I\"m Japanese, and know more than a thing or two about Ramen.   In my opinion, Monta is now just in a middle of the pack for Las Vegas ramen scene.  Don't believe in the hype.  .",

Ordered the tonkatsu Ramen and takana fried rice.  Tonkatsu broth was flavorful but not as rich and creamy as I've had at other place's Hawaii.  Noodles appeared similar to somen noodles.  Char siu tasted good but was cut VERY thin.    Takana fried rice was better than than the plain fried rice.  I wish there was a more pronounced takana flavor and (remember my low salt diet) it was a bit salty.  Overall a good experience, service was quick, food was good and of sufficient quantity, and prices were reasonable.  I would recommended going here, especially on a cold day/night.",

Choice of 4 Ramen bowls. Tonkotsu, Shoyu, Tonkotsu-Shoyu (combination), and Miso. My favorite is the Tonkotsu-Shoyu, best of both worlds!  Full of flavor, not bland at all..I only added a little bit of spice to add some heat! I would definitely add a hard-boiled egg (minus a star because you have to pay extra, EGG should be included!) The bowl itself it well portioned and I was full after finished off last drips of broth and slurping my last noodle.   We also had the pork belly bowl.  To me this was flat.  As in, not what I was expecting with pork belly.  It was more gelatinous than crispy with fat on it.  Order the small bowl to try it I'd say.   Quick tips: Can be a long wait as the place is small so plan accordingly.  However the food comes quick, almost 5 minutes after you order! so the turnaround time isn't bad at all.  Get your noodle fix at MONTA! Man...after writing this I'm salivating for some Ramen..I'll see you there",

The green onions were finely shredded and placed on top like a haystack, and the corn just piled on top.  The chasu was thin and soft and fell apart when picked up.  The broth did not have much flavor.  I couldn't understand why this place did such a wonderful business when right across the street at Hue Thai you can get a wonderful bowl of pho for the same price, and don't have to pay for any extras.  They also have bahn mi (sandwiches) for which they bake their own wonderful bread.    Skip Monta Noodles and get your noodles at Hue Thai!

I got the shoyu with boiled egg and cashu pork. The pork just melts in your mouth and the egg adds a nice texture to it. My Dad got the tonkastu with the cashu pork and loved that as well. Both types had amazing flavor, and we're just like the ones we fell in love with in Japan.   If I could give this place 6 stars I would!!!",

Honestly, if you're going have that reputation as \"Best of\", people will hold you to a higher standard.  I would say the service here is good: the servers are friendly, the food comes out fast, generally a clean restaurant, and the wait is not too long (30 mins during busy times). The kitchen is open with a bar counter for customers to see their food being made.   Onto the food, and the reason why this is given only three stars. It is unfortunate to say that Monta's food is only standard. You can find this kind of quality ramen at any restaurant that is dedicated to making only ramen. The broth is good, but other ramen places in Vegas can and have achieved the same results. The toppings are what you'll find at other ramen shops: butter, nori, chasiu, canned corn, green onion etc etc.   I will say that i do stop by Monta frequently for a bowl of ramen, however I would not make this a destination restaurant.

We sat at the bar and watched them dish out the glorious bowls of ramen.  There were 2 waitresses and service was pretty fast. The food came out pretty quickly about 5 min.  Kuro ramen 7.95 Tonkatsu ramen 6.95 with egg 1.50 and corn 0.50 Small pork belly over rice 3.95  Asahi beer  Our total bill came out to about $24  The broth got a bit salty towards the end but that didn't stop me from cleaning out the bowl. Definitely get some asahi beer with your ramen!",

We came right when lunch started which was perfect timing. We had maybe 3 or 4 parties before us and only waited about 30-45 minutes. Not bad.  The inside of the restaurant is small and intimate. We ordered the above because 1) we were hungry and 2) when would we ever be back anyways? The gyozas were juicy and the pork belly was delish. Reminded me of a beef bowl from Yoshinoya, but 100x better! The ramen was definitely a winner. In my boyfriends words \"the best ramen he's ever had.\" As for me, I don't know about it being the best I've ever had, but it's definitely ranked up high on my list.  If we're ever in the area again and there's not a long wait, we'll be back.",

    "text": "Google maps will lead you past this tiny restaurant if you're heading West on Spring Mountain Road. The icon will show that you need to pass Hauck street. Don't make that mistake, Monta Ramen is actually in the plaza before that street. Google map takes you to this empty plaza with nothing but a sleazy looking massage parlor. Hmmm....?   This small hole in the wall restaurant interior reminds me of Daikokuya Jtown LA but even smaller! They had an L shaped bar which probably sits 10-12 people max. There were about 5-6 regular tables, some made for two people & some made for four. What happens in a place like this? A number of overflowing people waiting out the door. I recommend you coming early or during non-peaked hours. We got lucky because there was only one party ahead of us when we got in but that quickly changed. By the time we got out, there were at least 10 parties on that waiting list.  First thing I noticed was the array of condiments in front of us. Shredded pink ginger, purified garlic, white pepper, Japanese chili powder, SPICY a$$ hot chili oil, vinegar, soy sauce just to name a few. Love restaurants that aren't all hipster tight up the butt about their condiments.  Had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen, a mixed blend of pork bone and soy sauce type soup based. The first one I've ever had actually since I'm typically accustomed to just Tonkotsu base. It was a little less rich and thick then the Tonkotsu base but still had that cloudy and strong taste. I added an egg and kimchi for a little more. For you carb lovers, you can add extra noodles for a minimal fee. I was quite satisfied with my ramen. My expectations were met even though they weren't that high since we were in Vegas and we know LA is crawling with bomb ramen houses. The chashu pork was quite fatty and the slices were on a smaller scale. The bowl of ramen itself was enough to make you full but not overly stuffed.  Also ordered the mini mentaiko bowl - cod fish row, seaweed, green onion, over rice. Nothing significant to report. The fried gyozas (pork and vegetable filling) were decent.  The ramen is nothing to die for but it really wasn't too bad. If you have a mad craving for ramen or just want to get something other than pho on Spring Mountain Road aka Chinatown, then Monta Ramen is there for you. Just be ready for a wait time. The ramen met my simple standards and the price was very affordable. The hard working staff are efficient and all \"peace sign\" fobby smiles.",

This is not the place to come with a large group, and there isn't a lot of seating.   We started with the Fried Rice. It comes in a regular or small size and since 3 of us were sharing, we ordered the regular. The portion isn't very big so if you want a lot I suggest ordering 2. It had tons of flavor and even chopped pieces of chashu. We all loved it and it was a nice compliment to our ramen.  My choice was the Miso Ramen. It consists of a pork and chicken broth with miso and medium-thick wavy noodles. I was determined to choose a ramen with those noodles instead of the thin ones, and I am glad I did. The noodles had just the right amount of chew, the chashu was tender, and the broth was packed with flavor. You must add the flavored egg. It was tasty, although it would be nice if they had the option for a poached egg.   A flavorful and unique choice is the Kuro Ramen Black Garlic Oil. It has tonsssss of roasted black garlic and a taste unlike anything I have tried before. Because of add-ons the total with tip for the 3 of us was $46 which I felt was fair. Next time we are craving ramen in Vegas, this will be our stop.",

This place is very small inside so you may not be able to fit a very large group and the wait times are always pretty long. However the bar section is usually open so you may be able to score those seats pretty quickly.  The menu consist of only a few items like different ramens, different fried rice, and a few little appetizers like gyoza.  I wasn't in the mood for ramen so I got the takana fried rice which was very flavorful and good. However my friend tried the kimchi fried rice and that was even better!   I did try some of my brother's ramen and it was really good as well. There was nothing there I didn't enjoy and according to a speaker on NPR radio it is one of the top ramen joints. I'm sure I'd agree if it was one of my go to foods.  The only thing I hate is that the sodas are served from cans so refills are not free. I'm so particular about my drinks - I'm terrible lol.",

The place is small and cozy, staff is very friendly and welcomes you as soon as you take a step into the door.   I went in with an opened mind, but not what I was expecting.   The soup I got was very milk! I can't remember the name, but it's the first one on their menu! Way to milky and had too many spices, the meat is very gooey, not how I like my meats!   The noodles were delicious!   The price is not bad at all for the amount of Ramen you get, each bowl is no more then $8 bucks.   My review might change after I go back and try their Miso Flavor soup. I'm a huge fan of miso soup, so we'll see!   Try it though, keep an opened mind. I might have just had a weird first time experience!",

Let me start by saying that this is also my first time eating ramen that I did not purchase at a grocery store and wow what a difference.   We arrived before opening and there was already people waiting outside. We got in line and waited. The fully we were able to get a seat.  The place is fairly small and it gets packed quick. It is absolutely worth it because people waited up to 45 minutes to get seated.   I started with the cold ramen and moved on to the Tonkatsu Ramen. It was absolutely amazing. I can't even describe the taste or the experience. You just have to try it for yourself.   This little gem gets my stars and I will definitely be returning next time I am in Vegas.",

No one sits there to play on their phones and take up seats when the place is tiny and because of the long lines outside. I love that their service is fast paced. They immediately help you with the menu as you sit down to order which picks up the speed on dining. Water is already served when you wait for your order too. Even though the environment and setting is small, I like how they accommodate seating areas such as having a bar for the single people who come in alone. At the bar you can see the food being cooked in front of you.  Today I ordered Kimchi Fried Rice and Shoyu Tonkatsu with thick noodles. I also included add on topping such as egg, seaweed paper, and extra chashu pork. My bill was $20 even for that. Pay is moderate but worth the filling. I was stuffed.",

It's such a nice place with delicious Ramen~ The staff are always nice and helpful even though the store gets busy almost all the time I'm there.  There is a waitlist since it's a popular place, but also has a small room.  It's worth the wait though. You can always get Boba next door called Kung Fu Tea while you wait or grab some afterwards.  You choose the type of Ramen you want and you can add topping for additional cost. I always add Nori(Dried Seaweed) and Nitamago(One egg split in half. Depending on the type of ramen you want the noodle will either be thick or thin. I enjoy either one in my opinion.",

    "text": "Omg I hate that I love their ramen! Why? Because I've dragged my family here four times this summer alone and only twice were we able to successfully dine here!  The place is small! It is so frustratingly small and I hope and pray all the time that they are slow. But that prayer has only been answered 50% of the time so far.  I'm reviewing after my fifth time here. The very first time was almost ten years ago with a friend for dinner. I don't recall waiting too long, and all the details like what day etc. what I did recall was the ramen being delicious.  Almost ten years since our dinner here with a friend, we are now married with two more kids and now reside in Vegas...I remembered the ramen...so we called our friend that brought us here to help us remember what the restaurant was called, Monta. Boom! We visited for the first time since in early June this year. We were lucky that day, we waited for 10-15 minutes and, were able to wait inside. Oh yeah, FYI the waiting area consists of the entryway where you definitely feel out of place and in the way. Second and third attempts were both fails. The place would be packed with everyone and their grandma on the Waiting to eat yummy ramen list they have on the podium at the front of the restaurant. Finally! After a failed attempt to eat at ANOTHER busy restaurant, I said hey maybe we'll get lucky on Spring Mountain. I decided to call ahead because I was starving and the woman on the phone said, there was no wait at all! BINGO!  My family and I were minutes away from winning! We pulled up and I jumped out while the husby went to park (that's the strategy guys!) and ran in to the restaurant to secure our seats! There were 3 four seater tables available and I was seated right away. Seconds later, the other 2 tables were taken and by the time my husby joined me, there were already people awkwardly waiting for a table in the entryway! Boooyah!  It was a Friday afternoon around 130pm, I ordered the ramen with black garlic oil etc etc, the kids each had a shoyu ramen, and the man guy husby had a pork belly bowl and ramen, we all shared an order of gyoza. Gyoza is mediocre, but the ramen is delish, from the broth to the noodles, to the crunchy garnishes. I love green onions and love that they give out lots of green onions! I'm originally from HI, so this is the closest place I've found to Goma Tei back in HI.  The place is always dark, probably because it only has one window pane that's blacked out because of the Vegas sun, and it's small as hell, there's bar type seating and tables. Seems clean, but it's too small for me to even really take in and observe. I've never used the restroom here because I can just imagine how small it is. Oh and did I mention this place is freaking small?  Parking is always crazy here too. The \"mall\" or \"plaza\" that it's located in consists of mostly eateries similar to theirs, small and yummy, because it's always packed. We also visit the yakiniku place a couple doors down and we are always forever waiting there too.  I love these places because the food is so unique, that's why we keep coming back for more.",

Their broth is rich, flavorful, and thick, and I like that they have more options than the typical Tonkatsu and Shoyu ramen! I really liked their Kuro broth. Their ramen comes with basic toppings (green onions, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage) and their extras range from $0.50 to $2.50. One bowl of ramen is definitely enough to fill you, but I split a chashu bowl with my boyfriend because everything was so cheap (so why not). It was delicious also!  Would recommend this place!",

We were promptly seated and ordered their tonkatsu ramen.

I don't know what to say.  This isn't a vegetarian ramen spot.   Anyway, I think its decent for what you get but now that Jinya and other ramen joints are here, and LA has so much competition, I don't think its through the roof, but I would definitely come back again and get some extra fatty broth.

Our go to ramen is the tonkutsu and garlic ramen. The broth is tasty but a little salty.  As for the fried rice it was a little oilier than what I remembered it to be.   This definitely hit the spot for my ramen craving today! Until the next time, Monta!",

Our friends love this place and wanted us to try it with them one night. Three of us all ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen and my husband ordered the chashu bowl.  Spicy Tonkotsu - 4/5: The broth is extremely rich and flavorful, which made for such a pleasant experience. The broth had such a good spice to it where I can feel it but it wasn't overbearing. I can still enjoy the flavor of the broth. The noodles were nice and chewy as well. I would definitely order this again.  Chashu Bowl - 3/5: Although absolutely great for the price, the quality of the meat and the overall taste weren't the greatest. The meat tasted like it didn't have enough sauce, and I felt like it needed it because the meat itself was dry. We wouldn't order this again.   Overall, this is a fantastic place for your ramen fix because it's delicious AND you can't beat the prices! Come check it out for yourself :)",

I don't think I would bring a large party in because it feels a bit claustrophobic, but definitely worth trying them out.   They are allergy accommodating, which was great for my girlfriend because finding a ramen house without cross contamination with nuts or seafood. Very cost effective for a party of 3 and a great treat even in the 106 degree summer!",

The soup was flavorful and so creamy. The spice could have been kicked up a couple notches but I understand the need to accommodate the average eater.  I also ordered the kimchi fried rice which was made quickly and it was good. Nothing too special about it, could have done with more protein in it, but it was a good contrast to the soup.   Service was friendly and quick. You come in and sign in, they will seat you asap if its full. We got there on a hot day so we only waited a couple minutes to be seated. There was bar seating as well as table seating. Plenty of parking as there was a full lot of spaces.  Will definitely be back to try the other ramens when I visit Las Vegas again. Happy Eating.",

    "text": "A lot of people have recommended this place to me.   First off, the environment is great, you get that  home feeling when you walk-in. Although, it's plain and simple, you're here for the food. It's a small location, so be prepare to wait. Best to go with less than 6-7 in your party. While sitting there eating at the bar area, I notice it was quite warm. They only had fans going, no A/C. Not sure, if their A/C was broken or what, so wear appropriate attire. Also, no outside food/drinks but they did put my Kung Fu tea drink in the fridge to give back to me after the meal, nice touch on their part.   Secondly, the customer service was good. The servers were attentive and provided a friendly smile to the place.   Lastly, the ramen proves to the best in Vegas or in Nevada in general. I had the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen with the following add-ons, corn and nitamago (flavorful egg). In addition, I order a mini bowl of Spicy Mentaiko.   Speaking of the Spicy Mentaiko, which cost only $3, it's quite yummy. At first glance, you think simple, not many components. There's the bed of rice with cut green onions, sprinkled sesame seeds and shredded seaweed with the spicy fish eggs placed perfectly on top. Take one bite with all of the above and you get mixture of flavors that makes you come back and finish the bowl faster than reading this review.   Now, the main entree. The Spicy Tonkotsu was one of the best I've had. Not spicy by any means, if you can handle sriracha, you got this. The noodles were grade A ramen noodles, the broth was rich and flavorful, the corn was corn, the egg was so good but the pork chatsu is amazing. Literally, melts in your mouth.   In short, what are you waiting for???",

It's near one of my favorite sushi omakase joints in Vegas (Kabuto) so I was somewhat familiar with seeing it from previous trips.  They specialize in tonkotsu ramen. Several varieties like tonkotsu with black garlic oil, shoyu tonkotsu and spicy tonkotsu. They also have plain shoyu ramen for those not into tonkotsu. They also have several side dishes including some gyoza, fried rice options, and other pork belly items like char Siu bowls.  I'll tell you what, it's not Japan or Hawai'i but it wasn't bad considering it was Vegas. The prices here for a bowl of ramen reflect the prices in Japan versus how expensive Ramen is in Hawaii. Go with the shoyu tonkotsu, gyoza and Kimchi fried rice. Have a beer too while you're at it. You'll leave satisfied and happy.",

Yes, there are definitely other great ramen shop(s) in Las Vegas, but Monta consistently delivers an amazing product across their menu.  You have to start out with an order of Gyoza. Don't even think about skipping it!  Sometimes pork broth is a little too greasy for me, so I usually opt for the Shoyu Ramen. I always like to add egg, corn, and butter to round out the flavor.  If your not into ramen, or would like to switch it up, both the Chashu and Pork Belly Bowls are super flavorful and satisfying.  Wash it all down with an Asahi draft and you'll be enjoying some of the most authentic ramen experience outside of Japan.",

I would recommend coming here on mid-afternoons or early evenings if you cannot wait.   So the faves are their spicy tonkatsu ramen and pork belly bowl. To be honest, I have not been here for months so I'm not quite certain if they actually changed the noodles as I thought it was way better before.   Prices are surprisingly on the cheaper side. A meal for 2 would probably costs around $20 only. I really don't mind paying extra as long as they don't sacrifice their standards.  Be warned though that parking can be a hassle as it is very limited compared to the number of restaurants in the area.   Overall, I would say this is my favorite ramen place in town!",

We arrived early and already there was a line, we started to get excited because that to me tells me this place is going to be delicious. And it was.  This place is very small makes getting in and out of the booths hard. And also means your seating super close to other people, which no one seems to mind.  As for the ramen , it come in a large bowl. It's very flavorful I added egg and my wife got it spicy. The portions are big but just Incase it's not enough you get an option to order more noodles. I couldn't even finish mines. Definitely recommend this place and look forward to returning",

    "text": "I came here after intending to go to Big Wong, but after looking inside at an empty dining room, I decided to come here.  I was not disappointed.  You can't beat the ramen here for the bargain.  It's only $7 for a decent sized bowl!    Do I think it's really awesome ramen?  No.  It's definitely a 4/5 on the ramen -- the broth is a little lighter (maybe, watered down?) than I'd like. However, the price really makes up for it at $7 for a bowl.  To add on extra noodles, it's only $1.50.  You will be very, very full and satisfied with extra noodles.  I like that they have minced garlic, pickled ginger, sesame seeds, and chili flakes at the table.  There's even chili oil.  Pro tip: Make sure you add the minced garlic and chili flakes.  When you get extra noodles, put some of the chili oil and more minced garlic to up the flavor on your \"second bowl\"",

I've been to other ramen places that have comparable ramen but paid twice has much.  Word of advice, the place opens at 11:30am I would get there EARLY, maybe even before they open cause the place is small (about 6 tables with about 8 bar seating). We got there right at 11:30am and got the last bar seating, the line waiting to be seated went out the door. If you have a big party (4+) this might not be a place to go to for you.   Would definitely recommend stopping by if you're ever near the strip.",

    "text": "During a recent trip to Vegas, I was surprised to discover that there are many options for ramen near the Strip. Unfortunately, after trying Monta, the most reviewed and the highest rated ramen spot in Vegas, I remain skeptical of the possibility of ramen excellence out here.  I tried the tonkotsu ramen, one of the six preparations available on the menu. I'm not a ramen expert. But I know from countless bowls in my lifetime that tonkotsu broth is usually creamy, salty, meaty, and fatty. The tonkotsu broth here is noticeably watered down and not particularly flavorful. If this is what they mean by \"kurume style\", I'm not a big fan.  The noodles were very thin. They smelled and tasted overly starchy like store bought noodles. The two small pieces of chashu were very thin too. I would say it was on the order of bacon thickness. I know that ramen is an assembled dish, but I wished that the chashu and the nitamago that I added were served at or near the temperature of the ramen broth. I found the cold temperatures off-putting.  While it's hard to argue against the extremely affordable prices you'll find here, the tonkotsu ramen at Monta was mediocre.",

Two of us got ramen and one of us got the takana fried rice. I got the tonkotsu ramen and added extra chasu (pork) and soft boiled egg. The broth was pretty good - not too salty but filled with flavor. I really didn't need the extra chasu. I was so full (I had a snack before I came). The portions was definitely worth it for the price!! Without any additions, any bowl of ramen is less than $8 - insane value meal. My friends also liked their meals!   The service was quick - great place if you wanted to come by for a quick lunch.",

It was as if the ramen gods heard my cravings and made it rain (it's summer) to set the mood. It also cut the line short as people started leaving due to the heavy rain and well... long wait. We, obviously took advantage. T'was meant to be. I ordered miso ramen and added extra chashu pork, flavored egg & shredded green onions for that extra crisp. Mister ordered tonkotsu shoyu ramen with flavored egg. Thank goodness he did because I was very much torn and even thought about getting both for myself. Mine was hands down better than his. I'm sure he thought the same because he had my bowl for a good 10 minutes. On top of all that goodness, we ordered a pork belly bowl & we each had 2 glasses of Asahi beer. Best meal ever!  The only thing is, this place is quite small.",

I usually order the spicy tonkatsu ramen with eggs and extra onions. The broth is very thick and has a lot of flavor to it. The portion is okay, not too much and not too little. On the other hand, the portion for the Kim chi fried rice is very little. Another than that, this place is great! A must try for you ramen lovers.",

This is a small joint that seats no more than 30 at a time I would estimate - I didn't sweep the room and take a head count, so that's my ballpark estimate.  It's probably the good-sized living room w/their kitchen incl'd for the whole place.  Their menu and selection is straightforward and simple:  3 types of noodle broth and you pick and add the extras you want in there.  Each of the 3 soups come with green onions, two slices of cha siu, bamboo shoots and kikurage.  You pay anywhere from 50 cents to two bucks for addt'l toppings.  They also have gyoza and varieties of fried rice & pork belly bowl - yummm!  I ordered the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen with extra helpings of Cha Siu and Nori.  First sip of the broth and ohhh was I in my happy place!  The combination of the tonkatsu pork bone / fat with the Shoyu soy sauce made for a flavorful rich, creamy and salty soup.  I was quite happy that I ordered extra servings of the cha siu.  Let me tell you that was one of the best slices of pork I've ever had.  They simply just melted in my mouth and the taste with the broth made it simply superb for the entire experience.  Definite must return the next time we're back and I'd give my recommendation to anyone as well.  Expect the long wait and you'll also have to put up with some cramped seating arrangements and limited elbow room - you're not going to get anything more than 5 persons to a table.  Aside from that, not to forget at the verly least, service was very good and friendly.",

Did I mention that they are also hand-made in the restaurant?  I watched them make it on one of my previous visits where I forgot to check in.  Ramen wise, you can't go wrong.  Their tonkatsu shoryu ramen is my fave though :9",

    "text": "Can't say enough good things about this place... I actually joined yelp  just to write a review.   I travel very frequently & always try to seek out the best Ramen / noodle houses in the cities I visit often as I'm a noodle junkie. I don't know why it took me so long to find Monta, though I'm really happy I did as I'm in Vegas every other week.   Firstly, the greeting and staff are extremely friendly - which really surprised me in a positive way considering Monta is located in Chinese town (an area I typically expect to be underwhelmed by service). Very attentive and happy - I left in such a better mood than I arrived!  I sat at the comfortable wooden bar & ordered the Miso Ramen with extra chashu. It was nice to watch the 2 cooks prepare the bowls ordered before mine as it was immediately clear that they were dedicated to the quality of preparation, ingredients and timing to ensure their guests received a perfect serving. In between orders I watched one cook prep and truss the pork for slow roasting & was impressed with the skill.  My bowl arrived as a perfect portion & nicely presented. I only added a dash or two of the toasted sesame seeds & a dash of the chili powder that were part of a good array of seasonings available to personalize the noodles to your taste. I like that.  The broth was truly wonderful: rich and creamy while carrying a fresh pork flavor. Noodles were nicely cooked, although a little thinner than I find my favorite to be (Santouka still purveys the finest noodle I have come across). The definite star of the bowl were the delicate and chashu slices that pinch perfectly into the grip of the chopsticks! The flavor, texture, and quality of this moist pork is truly superb.  Suffice to say that Monta has immediately become a favorite here in Vegas; a city where the experience usually fails to measure up to the hype.  Enjoy.",

    "text": "My first experience at Monta wasn't very good despite all the gleaming reviews I've read. The tonkatsu ramen tasted slightly gamy and was way too salty. I gave them another shot and it was a lot better. Gone was the gamy flavor of the broth. It was good but not amazing, in my opinion. Not the kind of broth you want to drink up. The chashu pork had a slightly smoky flavor and was OK. The nice wait staff and the cheap ramen help me see the attraction to this place. However, compared to other ramen places, I don't believe Monta's ramen stands out in presentation and flavor.",

We always order the tonkatsu shoyu with thin noodles and it is never a disappointment. The place is super small which sucks for a large size party or one with little ones (our case). That means you have no choice but to wait for one of the 4 tables to clear and you find yourself awkwardly staring at the people to see who will be done soon. This is not a place to sit and chat. Just eat and go. It gets packed ALL the time. We had to put a system in place where we drive up, someone hops out the car, puts the name on the list, THEN we look for parking, and sit in the car to wait LOL. We tried a Ramen place up the street and it just did not compare with Monta. It was more spacious with less of a wait time but that didn't make up for the Ramen. We'd rather wait and let claustrophobia kick in at Monta because it is so worth it :)",

I can't explain this ,but the broth is a bowl of salty goodness.  Cons:  *  A bit on the crowded side.  It's a small place packed with tables and seating.  *  It's a hit or miss with the wait for this place... it's always busy so be prepared.  * Parking sucks...period!  Overall:   One of my favs in Vegas.  I'm giving it a four stars in comparison to other Ramen places I've been (not necessarily in Vegas).    Tips: *  A good place to come with a group of friends.. Very casual atmosphere *  Be eco-friendly and save yourself the hassle by trying to carpool if possible.",

Service is no nonsense...they want to turn their tables over ASAP since it is small but popular place...even on a Monday around 6 PM it was fairly pack and by the time we were leaving there were 3 or 4 groups of diners waiting.  However, still, I guess they were nice.  When I asked for a soup without noodles, I confused the waitress and she brought me a bowl of just plain tonkatsu broth...no meat, no vegetables.  I was a little confused and thought is was additional broth for my husband's ramen. I ask the other waitress and in a few minutes she brought me the correct order, but mentioned what seemed obvious to me that it would be the same price with or without noodles.   The tonkatsu broth was rich in texture and deep with flavor and shows quality, time, and care in preparation. I loved it.  However, in comparison to Sora, I like Sora's broth just slightly better maybe because it was just a touch lighter in texture and flavor. Monta's didn't put nearly the amount of pork that Sora does. I do sample the noodles and I prefer Sora's noodles; they are sort of springy and light, Monta's were a little heavier.   My husband who eats ramen the normal way, also prefers Sora.  I guess, I like Sora's style of ramen soup better, but it is purely just a preference, and both are very good.",

A and I are creatures of habit; so far we've ordered their pork belly bowl and tonkatsu ramen with all the trimmings. The pork belly bowl is delicious, perfect amount of meat for the rice, yet sometimes I find it a little bit on the greasy side. The tonkatsu ramen is good too. Fresh thin noodles with tasty broth. I think it's one of the best ramen houses in LV, but I've had better ramen when I used to live in the Bay area. I am still fan though, because the servers are quick and efficient. The prices are more than fair too so what's not to love?",

My coworker tried the gyoza and a pork belly bowl and was very pleased with both. I stuck with the tonkatsu ramen ($6.95) with extra pork added ($2.50). The broth was silky, creamy, and perfect! Pho broth seems so blah after eating this. The 6 slices of pork in my bowl were just fatty enough and so delicious!   A pleasant surprise was canned, cold oolong tea for $1.75. It was delicious and really hit the spot. When you're eating soup in 105 degree weather, a cold drink seems more appropriate than hot tea.   Service was friendly and accomodating and the broth can't be beat ! I'll be back - but next time I'll be going noodle-less. The noodles are a waste of space ! More yummy broth and meat please.",

    "text": "This is what I call GOOD RAMEN. This place is quaint and cute nestled away in a little shopping center off of Spring Mountain. It is SMALL so there may be a wait around peak times. That's probably the only downside. But it's definitely worth it.  They had four ramen to choose from: tonkatsu (pork bone), shoyu, miso, or tonkatsu-shoyu. All of which come with the basics: chashu (pork slices), bamboo shoots, green onions, and kikurage mushrooms. You have the option to add \"extras\" to personalize your ramen.  I had the tonkatsu-shoyu ramen with a boiled egg (as an extra). In retrospect, I should have ordered extra chashu -- which I recommend you do if you like pork. The meat was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth that the two slices the bowl comes with wasn't nearly enough! The broth was very tasty and not too salty like how some ramen can be.  They have other side dishes (gyoza, fried rice, etc) but I have a feeling those aren't the reason people come here. They're simply there as fillers. Stick to the star of the place: ramen of course!  This is definitely the place I will come to to satisfy my ramen cravings that I get once in a while. I have a feeling as soon as winter hits, I will definitely be frequenting this place for the warm deliciousness that is Monta Ramen :)",

The place is quite small, seating maybe 30 people, including the bar.  During lunch, there is a wait to get seated.  The cooks are out in the open, similar to the sushi bar trend.  I've always had good service, although sometimes there is a little bit of a communication problem... my English isn't so good sometimes! ;-)  But that's never annoyed me because I love the soups here.  So far I have only tried the Tonkatsu. I ordered with extra pork, egg, and (I know, shame on me), butter.  you can also order extra noodles if you aren't a big broth eater.  The Tonkatsu is, I believe, a pork based broth.  Its thick (for a broth), a little salty (but not too salty), and very flavorful.  The pork was cut very thinly, and was so juicy, almost buttery.  I barely had to chew it.  Now, I am no expert in homemade noodles or anything, but the noodles for me were quite good... filling and tasty.    I can't wait to try the other two main ramen dishes they have.  I know now isn't the perfect time for hot ramen, but I'll make an exception to that rule for this place any time!",

    "text": "Ode to Monta's Pork Belly Bowl  cue violin  Hey, I just ate you, and this is crazy... but here's my hunger , so feed me maybe?   All of the ramen bowls, try to tempt me, but here's my chopsticks, so feed me maybe?    Yeah this will probably be out of date by the time I hit submit review, but I'll deal with it.   I've been to Monta several times since it opened, and the first 8 or 9 times I stuck with getting various ramen.  Of those my favorite quickly became the Tonkotsu as I really enjoyed the creaminess of it.  I did like the other two as well, but always found myself going back to Tonkotsu.  As a quick aside, I actually found the Tonkotsu-Shoyu to be my least favorite.  The pork was always tender and tasty, and I would almost always get an egg added and I tried most of the other additions as well.   I personally didn't find many of them to be worth the extra cost to add, though I did like the Mustard Leaf on occasion.    For an appetizer I had the Gyoza a few times and found them to be very good examples, but not extraordinary at the same time.   Then one day I decided to split a pork belly bowl with a friend as an appetizer.  Game change.   It's seriously all I think about when I think of Monta now.  As much as I enjoyed the Ramen whenever I'd had it, it took a backseat to this dish in my heart and stomach.  Currently saving up for an engagement ring.  Pork Belly Bowl will make a lovely bride.  Service is always friendly if a little rushed, and I always thought the overall price was decent.  Still need to try Anime and Sora so no comparison on Ramens unfortunately, but unless they have Pork Belly Bowl on their menu, it might not matter.",

But the second I walked in, I was taken aback to the tiny ramen shops back in Japan, with 1 long bar and a few tables.  Immediately my attitude changed for the good.  I looked at the menu, just 3 kinds of ramen, but you really don't need an exotic variety, just the ones you're really good at making.  Being kinda picky, I had ordered the Miso ramen, but with no mushroom or bamboo shoots, and added an egg and corn.  The soup came, and I did my usual broth test and was very surprised to find it was really good to me.  I added some sesame oil and went to town.  The egg was a nice addition, and the corn just reminded me of the food in Japan.    I was highly satisfied by the food and the place.  I will definitely be back again.",

First impression, the parking lot was dark, the stores adjacent to the place was even darker and this place was open with nobody inside; couldn't even see the staff.   Instant O.o  Went inside, VERY simple interior kinda like a template style for restaurants with no outstanding unique traits for a ramen place.  I've eaten all over little tokyo in LA and cities around there so I know what good ramen taste like.  The food was slightly above par, but maybe it's cause what i'm used to. =/  However, i can say this place is up there as the top ramen places compared to the others I've tried, although to some, it may not mean much.",

    "text": "My experience with ramen is limited. There was a place near the Beverly Center in Los Angeles where I had some and liked it enough to return. The ramen at Monta is a whole other level of good. It's not only the best ramen I've ever had, it's the best Japanese food. My experience with Japanese food is that presentation is more important than flavor. That wasn't the case here.  We started with gyoza. These dumplings were tasty although maybe a tad too salty for me. Then our ramen soon arrived. I got the kontatsu with pork belly, green onions, egg and corn. The broth was tasty. A couple of different flavors going on. Quite savory. The noodles were perfect. Not overcooked and delicious. And all the toppings were good, too.  Janet got miso soup and was quite happy with her choice. She noted it was thicker than my soup. It seems like a winner. When we got there at 7 p.m. there were a couple of open tables and most of the bar was empty. By the time we left just after 8 p.m., every seat was taken, we had to push through a half dozen people standing at the door waiting to eat and another couple of cars pulled up with people going there to eat. It seems quite popular. Most of the people inside appeared to be of Japanese descent.",

I thought the noodles and pork slices were nicely cooked, but the pork broth was a touch saltier than what I prefer.  My husband's miso broth was smooth and savory, without the overwhelming saltiness.  There are also options for you to add in extra ingredients to customize your bowl, such as an egg, pork, corn, and extra noodles.  A great find that's different from the usual Vegas eateries.",

Finally, after searching, I found it in Las Vegas of all place.  The first time I had Monta, I was hungover and it was damn good.  The second time I had it, I was dead sober and it was still damn damn good.    Honestly, if I could, I would give Monta 5+++ stars.  I have been here a couple of times and have tried all of the broths, and by far, the best broth is the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth (rich, salty, melt in your mouth goodness).  The tonkatsu is a close second because wow, the broth is super-stick-to-your-ribs rich.  Make sure that no matter what you order, make sure to get extra pork and the amazingly, soft-boiled egg, with a slightly soft and runny center.  Go get your ramen on!",

Despite how low his restaurant ratings are, the fact that he chose to eat at this specific noodle house says a little something something about their food.   To keep this short and sweet:  - Friendly service - Was a wait around 12:30 (prime lunch time) but still got seated and served within 30 min - Tonkatsu ramen= perfect portions. I ended up slurping up more of the broth than the noodles which was very surprising (i never drink the broth) - Small fried rice seemed small at first for the four of us but was just the right amount with the ramen.  - Lots of ginger and garlic sauces for unlimited consumption - parking lot big in plaza   I want more!!!",

    "text": "So far this place has the best price for the minimum amount. Once you add in all the addition it will be around $11. Compare this place to Shoku Ramen which is down the street, it is very competitive. Again another ramen house with salty broth. Can I get a normal broth with just bone and vegetable taste then I add my own fish sauce and miso to my liking? The saltiness is still better than Shoku ramen, but then again it might be my bad luck at Shoku Ramen.   Monta Ramen is pretty closed to my house. The combination of garnish, slice of belly pork, and broth is not fully met to the famous tonkotsu. But overall it was good. The service is fast. I get to pick thick or thin noodle. The decoration was earth tone which is easy to the eyes but not vibing like Las Vegas strip interior design. The kitchen is huge compare to the seating space. If they were to do a remodel again, they might want to calculate out the total space and give more space to the seatings. The last time I counted, this has less than 45 seats. I think they can push to the 50-60 if they redo the kitchen. The menu do not have a long list of items. Just broth, noodle pot, fryer and a few pots to boil. How much are storage spaces? I think there is a huge space for storing food to the decade. Not just 6 months supplies. Starbuck have the same total items but look at the reasonable kitchen size.",

The restaurant is actually quite small and if you come during peak lunch hours, you might have a 20-30 min (which is what happened to me).  You have 4 broth flavors to choose from:   Tonkotsu (very savory) - My favorite Shoyu (salty/soy sauce) Tonkotsu-Shoyu (combination of the first two which tastes funky to me) Miso   Each comes with 2 slices of chashu, some bamboo shoots and green onion. You have the option of adding more chashu, boiled egg, corn, kimch etc. Usually 2 slices of chashu isn't enough for me since its a GIGANTIC bowl of ramen and I can never finish it. They do have rice dishes and gyoza which is okay but not the best. Bill came out to be around $20 for two noodles so very reasonable.",

We were third, but because the first wave of customers had all been seated at about the same time, it took a while for them to start to finish.  I occupied myself watching the guy actually making the ramen, which was fun.  Once the first wave started to finish, a bunch of seats opened up in quick succession.  My wife and I both ordered the tonkatsu ramen with nitamago (a seasoned hard-boiled egg) and extra chashu pork.  It was fantastic, among the best I've ever had, and certainly much better than could reasonably be expected from a strip mall in Las Vegas.

    "text": "Okay so I have been on a crazy ramen kick these last few weeks.  I can't seem to get sick of it, which really needs to happen soon because all this sodium is not condusive to my eating clean and healthy.  I know I said in my Sora review that I probably would not go back to Monta after falling in deep and passionate love with my bowl of ramen at Sora, but I wanted to eat by myself today and I knew if I went to Monta, I could probably get a seat quicker than at Sora since Monta has the counter-top seating.  I used to go to Monta every Saturday for lunch by myself and noticed that there were a lot of people who like to eat there by themselves, which makes it easier and faster for me to get a seat.  Today was so busy!  So busy in fact, that I still had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated. They only have a couple of servers who also double (triples?) as hostesses and bussers so these ladies are running around like crazy.  Like Sora, I just find myself exremely impressed at how quickly they turn tables over without making you feel rushed when you're eating.  I love to sit at the counter-top and watch them making the ramen.  The guys are super nice and will usually chat a little bit when I've been there on Saturdays, but today he was constantly running around getting those delicious bowls of steaming ramen out of the kitchen.     Anyway, I don't have anything against Monta.  I just think Sora is way better.  However, I did leave there today feeling extremely happy and satisfied.  I always get the Tonkatsu-Shoyu with chasyu and nitamago.  One bowl of ramen is usually more than enough for me.  If I'm with someone, we will usually also get the gyoza, which are good but nothing special.  Today, however, I decided to try something new and adventurously ordered the kimchi fried rice.  Not sure why regular fried rice comes in a small and large, but add some kimchi to it and you can only get one size, which is a large serving.  But I'm glad I got it because it was freakin' wonderful!  The seasoning is just perfect and the kim chi is just subtle enought that it doesn't overpower the fried rice taste.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!  I still can't help but compare my ramen at Monta to my ramen at Sora, and though it falls short, I still really enjoy Monta as part of my ramen rotation and will continue to go there every once in a while.",

Even if you can't enjoy the ramen, come here and try their rice dishes, they're pretty good.   All in all, it's a good spot to hit up the morning after a night of intense hardcore drinking.

I got:  Tonkotsu ramen $6.95 - it's a small bowl, 2 pcs fatty pork, small amount of noodles, some green onions, & the broth, no egg that's extra, no seaweed - that's extra.  Still liked it.  B. got Miso Ramen $7.25 w/ extra bamboo shoots .50 + nori .75  Our total 15.45 + $1.25 tax = $16.70 before tip.  Charged it.  Quick & fast dinner before our flight home.",

    "text": "Me and my friends actually ended up here because the line at Oyster Bar was too long and we were starving. I personally am a ramen fan in general so I like trying new places, my other friend and her hubby are not big ramen fans, but luckily, after coming to Monta they have found a renewed interest in ramen.  We all started with a glass of beer, pretty cheap at about $3 but they are not pints, I think more like 10oz-ers? Still it was a refreshing way to start the meal.  Shared the pickled greens fried rice and the pork belly rice bowl. Fried rice was cooked well and flavorful, the pork belly bowl was even better. The fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly tender with their greasy goodness seaping into the rice underneath.   For ramen I got the half pork half chicken broth and added an egg. The chicken broth is supposed to be a little less rich but mine was still a pretty thick broth. Not that that's a bad thing, thick as in thick with flavor but sometimes I prefer a less rich broth because it can get very filling. So depending on what you like, the full tonkatsu broth would be richest and most flavorful and a the half and half would be a lighter version. Noodles were cooked perfectly.   The place is typical small Japanese style shop, they have a list for you to write your name on and wait. The waitresses do a nice job of clearing the tables and getting everyone seated as soon as possible so even though we had a few parties ahead of us the wait wasn't too bad for lunch hour. It does get a little hot inside though, so be warned for those coming in the summer months.",

After a two days of almost non-stop clubbing adventure and drinking for a bachlorette party we were seeking a hangover cure. The throbbing BUM BUM BUM and the dehydration headaches were kicking in from drinking close to 6 bottles of vodka. Of course split amongst 10 girls + the extra 3 bottles of \"blow job shots\" and \"scooby snax shots\" that resided in our hotel.   We came at 10:30am. They open at 11am and dafuq they had a line already waiting. Of course we were the second party that arrived. However the first party ahead of us only had 2. The total capacity in this small restaurant was probably... 28-32 seats. What I noticed in Las Vegas was... when the restaurant says it opens at a designated time... they sometimes open 10 minutes earlier. This goes to many of the restaurants outside of the strip. I never understood that. Also the patrons here are rude. Another party arrived and tried to CUT INFRONT OF US. To get in. WTF VEGAS? SCUMBAGS NO?  Anyways, the ramen here is comparable to some very phenomenal ramen joints in Japan. The Ramen mecca. It could go head to head to Santouka ramen and probably kick their ass easy.  Broth is rich, not too salty. Meat tender. Noodles perfect. I had opted for the Shoyu Tonkatsu ramen. Because I love soy sauce based ramens. With the combination with the Tonkatsu broth? F yea.  I also love my ramen SPICY. They had a special on that. It was every bit of heaven you could ask for.  NOT TOO SALTY YET RICH. CHECK. NOT TOO OILY YET STILL SAVORY. CHECK. CUSTOMER SERVICE? Awesome. The lady was lovely. The cooks focused.  Would I drive 4-5 hours to eat this again? Hell yea I would.",

I felt better after throwing up. My husband had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen and I tried a little bit of its soup...I can say it's better than the Kuro...I guess it's the oil that has extra sodium in it. My hubby and son liked the small pork belly bowl that we shared, just to taste it. I was expecting the belly to be crispy but it's the same meat that they put in the ramen. The gyoza is just average...nothing to talk about. We waited for an hour to be seated and I think it's not worth the wait. I won't be coming back to this place. There are other better ramen places in town, especially in that area.",

The noodles are fantastic, the broth very flavorful, and the toppings, including the chashu, complete the bowl. Oh, and the fried rice is pretty good, too!  The place has a cozy and traditional feel to it. It's a very small establishment, but this is what you should expect from an authentic Japanese restaurant.

No one has time to stand around to chat and explain things to you but they try very hard to seat everyone as quickly as possible and they manage to bring you your food quickly and correctly.  Hubby and I are purists...we stay with the tonkotsu broth.  The broth was rich and sticky...didn't taste like it was brewed only from pork bones but also from pork feet/hock.  Very tasty and comforting.  On our second visit, I got extra char siu.  When the fat from the char siu melted into my broth, it got even thicker and richer.  Hey, you say greasy, I say yummy!!  Other standouts - takana fried rice and pork belly bowl...all very good!!  Definitely going to be a staple for us when we're in LV.",

Every time I go to this place there is a line out the door because of all the people waiting to experience this culinary delight.   The noodles and toppings are all delicious, but there's something about the broth that makes this ramen to die for. Also, the pork. It's flavorful and fatty, and I would recommend getting extra if you feel like spoiling yourself.   Be careful though, this stuff is about as addicting as crack. After your first time, you'll keep going back until you realize it's gotten out of hand, and that you need to stop for the sake of your bank account and health. I put on about five pounds after first discovering this place, and I've gotten many friends addicted as well.   My personal favorites include the Spicy Tonkatsu with egg and shredded onion, and Kuro with butter and extra pork.",

Didn't feel bloated.  Portion size was perfect.  I tipped the chefs directly.  What a great find !",

I ordered their tonkotsu ramen while my husband ordered the miso ramen. Verdict? The miso ramen was a lot taster and the noodles were better. The broth had a rich depth of flavor and the noodles were thicker and perfectly al dente in Japanese terms.   The place is very small so be prepared for a wait, but I think it was worth a drive from the strip. Cheap, good eats!",

    "text": "Besides gallivanting on the Las Vegas strip for some great eats, my cousin and I decide to venture out. We wanted to get some curry, but the place we wanted to go to was closed during lunch hours. So with my trusty Yelp app, we decided to search what was popular around the vicinity. Monta Ramen was the first thing that popped up in our search, so we headed there.  As we arrived, there was a small line formed outside the building. Typical for a well known ramen spot. We added our name to the wait list and had about a fifteen minute wait. Once we were called, we sat around the prep area. Our server handed us our menus and gave my cousin some recommendations on their popular dishes. As for myself, I already knew what I was going to get.  I decided to the the miso based ramen, which includes some basic ingredients:  - Green onions  - Two slices of chashu - Bamboo shoots - Kikurage  There are extras you can add to your ramen, pricing varies. I got the following extras:    - Butter - Corn - Extra side of noodles - Nori - Soft boiled egg  Our ramens came out fairly quickly after placing our orders. As quickly as they were served, they remained piping hot! The presentation was nicely put together. I mixed all the ingredients in the bowl and took my first sip of the broth. The broth was very tasty. The addition of the butter gave the broth a creamy taste. The noodles were soft and easy to chew. The hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked to my liking with the runny yolk. The chashu seemed a little dry, but still tasted great.  Overall, a great experience and comparable to some of my favorite ramen spots in the Bay Area.",

I would give them 6 stars if I could, for their food.   Waiting is super long. One time I got here, the wait was almost an hour and I gave up. It's also very small inside, and I always have the pressure that people would hear me talking with my friends and the fact that a lot of people are waiting while I'm waiting keeps making me try to eat faster (I'm a slow eater, by the way). Since it's always packed, when you come here in the summer, even with the AC on, you can still be sweating bullets.   Parking is a pain. We usually have to park somewhere across the street, not in that shopping center.",

We were staying in the north end of the Strip so I suggested ramen and everyone was game.  It was the PERFECT last meal of the trip. We went at 9:30 pm in our yoga pants to get our food to go. I got the Spicy Tonkatsu. My colleagues got the Miso and Shoyu. Our to-go containers had noodles in one container and the broth in another. Everything was tightly sealed - no spills on the way back to the hotel. They gave us spoons, forks and chopsticks.  And we all DEVOURED our bowls. The spicy had a little kick - I would call it a mild-medium. I haven't had much ramen in my life and I now understand why so many of my friends CRAVE it. Especially when it was as good as this was. We all had Ramen bellies in the morning.  Parking is a little tricky - it is a small lot with a lot of busy restaurants. Be patient! It's worth it! Next time I go - I want to get bubble tea from the tea shop two doors down, too.",

    "text": "Salt bombed is the best way to describe both of our ramen bowls. The thick and rich, gravy-like broth, was extremely salty and offended our taste buds. Although I preferred the spicy miso ramen over the tonkotsu shoyu, they were both incredibly heavy and beyond rich. The bowl and noodles were piping hot, but the broth was just warm.   We couldn't finish our bowls and left about 65% of it back (noodles and broth). After our dinner, our stomachs had a hard time digesting the richness and we felt a little nauseous. We could of shared one bowl of ramen, it was super filling and we had a ton of leftovers.   This is the first time I've ever regretted adding extra toppings on my ramen. The toppings didn't enhance or compliment our ramen. It all got lost in the thick salty broth. Plus the topping choices were rather boring, the best had to of been: corn, kimchi, and nitamago (flavored egg) - the kimchi was fresh and flavorful and they have perfected their soft-boiled egg!  Here's what we ordered:  Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with thin noodles (I didn't care for these noodles) and 2 slices of chashu (and with all of the extras): +dried seaweed - pretty boring +corn - I loved the corn's sweetness and texture  +nitamago (flavored soft boiled egg)- perfect!  +mustard leaf - mushy and flavorless +shredded green onion - adds nice texture and freshness +butter - this ramen doesn't need more richness!  $12.45   Spicy Miso Ramen with thick wavy noodles (the best noodles!) and 2 slices of thin chashu (and with all of the extras): +dried seaweed - boring +corn - great! +nitamago (flavored egg) - great!  +mustard leaf - boring and mushy +shredded green onion - adds freshness +butter - this ramen does not need more richness! :x $13.75  Side of extra chashu $2.50 - super fatty and buttery.   Side of Kimchi $1 - very fresh and flavorful.   Small pork belly bowl $3.95 - this was my favorite. The pork belly was tender, buttery, and rich in flavor. The rice was cooked perfectly and the green onion and sweet pickled ginger added perfect freshness to the rice bowl.  After eating here, it really made me miss Santouka Ramen in Costa Mesa, CA and Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata Ramen in Fountain Valley, CA. :/",

I took take out since waiting for a table is that of when the president arrives and stops all lanes of traffic, no one is ready and no one knows how to make it flow. Place is jam packed because of the tasty ramen provided but my personal opinion they have fallen off the tracks a bit due to such overwhelming success.  I took the tonkatsu soyu but was given just the soya offering. Discovered when I arrived to my home. The broth was what I wanted but it was too late and I felt it's from monta so it should taste good either way; I was not impressed. There were a few things wrong with the meal the tea egg was over cooked and just the overall wait inside the shop to pick up your Togo wasn't very pleasing.   This isn't a make or break for me with Monta just gave me a reason to find other ramen around town that do just ask great if not better",

Looked like a major fire hazard so I did a 180 and got my ramen fill elsewhere.   This time, I came around 4pm, so with such an odd hour, I'm so glad I didn't have to wait! There's really not that many seats available but they do have pretty fast service. I had to try their tonkotsu ramen, adding the corn and the seasoned egg. The best part was definitely the chashu...melt-in-your-mouth delicious! The soup was a little thick/salty but still good. Overall, I would come back to maybe try the black garlic oil or add in other toppings and customize to my liking.",

    "text": "First off, I'm a huge ramen eater.  I came on a Saturday with two other people for dinner at around 6pm.  We had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated.  Once seated, I went for their Miso based ramen with added garlic oil, chili, egg, and corn.  It was delicious!  My only complaint was it was very salty.  Not overwhelmingly salty, but salty.  The ramen was the perfect texture.  The meat was good and everything went together really well.  My sister went for their Shoyu ramen, which is soy sauce based.  I had a sip of the broth and it was pretty good.  If you want a healthier choice, the Shoyu would be the one to go with.  We also ordered one Mini Mentaiko bowl but didn't even touch it because we were so full.  But later tried it and the eggs were way too salty.    For 3 bowls of ramen and the mentaiko, our total was about $24 without tip.  It was very reasonable.  The service was very fast.  Our food came out super fast.  The inside of this place is teeny tiny.  There's about 5 small tables and the bar that's it.  Prepare to wait on the weekends.  PS... if you have a crying baby/child, this is not the place to bring him or her.",

Im a server in LA called shinsengumi as well so i know how customer service works but they dont know how to do customer service at all. They also collect dirty dish from our table instead of holding on there hands. They took away dishes when were still eating as well without asking .",

Also I'm used to having an onsen egg included without extra charge, whereas here they don't include egg in your order, you have to order it as an add on. Lastly, the rice in the pork belly bowl was soggy. If you're from a city with amazing Asian food, I'd skip this location if you're in Vegas, you won't be super impressed.",

Everyone was waiting outside at that time so I'm pretty sure they could notice me when I walked in. However, I waited for a long time before I got a greeting. The elder lady noticed me on her way to the bar area and she knew I was waiting for assistance but she tried to ignore me and just let me be there.      Ok, fine.      My bf and I went there for breakfast and the elder lady I met last time looked unhappy to serve, she served everyone because she have to. Also, I got an egg for my ramen and I have to rush to the restroom for the next couple hours. It's our first meal today and it almost ruined my day.  so..., plz plz plz make ur food fresh and ur waitresses look happy!!",

There are several restaurants and even the snow shavery in this parking lot so sometimes parking can be a little difficult, but it's worth it.   Monta was smaller than expected inside...large parties may have a hard time here. There is bar seating much like a sushi bar and 4-5 tables. That's it! We came on a Friday evening at 6pm and were in and out by 7! Service was fast and easy.   The menu is simple, basically it's a choice of a Ramen noodle bowl or rice to include a pork belly bowl which is soooo fantastically good!   You can get a side of kimchi, flavored boiled egg, shredded green onion, butter, etc. they have plenty of table top items to add extra flavors to your meal which I loved...chili oil, soy sauce, garlic butter, vinegar and a blend of awesome seasonings.   Drinks come in a can (except water) and I think there was a choice of one beer (Asahi).   We had a great experience and will likely return for another round.",

What we got is like plain noodles with broth. It's supposed to have pork chasu. And we ordered extra eggs and chasu. Nothing inside the box. We called and let them know we got plain noodles no meat nothing else beside noodle and the broth. The lady who picked the phone so rude. She said it's not right. Never happened like that. They always checked and she asked if I checked. I said no I didn't. Not even sorry and trying to say they are always right and I'm lying. And my bf there with me and he said we got nothing but noodles and broth. Then she said what is my name and phone number next time if we eat there they will give us extra. We haven't came back for very long bc we were so mad with their customer service. But decided to come back and give them another chance bc of they have good food. Guess what we both came back today and got upset stomach after couple hours. Didn't eat anything  after and we knew it from the restaurant what we ate. have to stay in the restroom for long time.

    "text": "I'm no ramen guy. Actually, this is my first experience with True ramen from a restaurant. It definitely met my expectations. I got the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen on my friend's advice, and I also split some fried rice. Loved the rich broth, the texture of the noodles, and the way that the chashu (which isn't like what I'm used to) just melted away in my mouth. I can see how some people would complain of saltiness, but I liked it just fine. The fried rice was also delicious, although it did seem pricey for, you know, fried rice.  I was surprised at first by how small the place is, but after it became apparent that this is a spot for a quick meal, including rapid filling of orders, I saw how they could get away with it. You definitely shouldn't pick this place if you wanna linger around for an hour or more.",

The broth had hearty pork flavor and thick, creamy consistency, noodles were QQ- had the right amount of springy texture and chewiness to it, egg and Chashu Pork cooked perfectly. Everything blended really well together in flavor and texture. Anddd, what you get for the price makes it that much better! Super affordable and delicious always makes for a great meal!  The fried rice was one of my favorites as well. It's one of those dishes you will end up craving after you leave. Just get it when you go, trust me. I was hesitant when my friend ordered it because it's just fried rice- I could make that at home, right? I ended up eating most of it and left wanting more.   I've been patiently waiting for Monta to open in Richardson and when it does, I hope it's just as good as it was in Vegas. Can't wait!",

It has all the same character small place holds less then fifty people, bar area (cool get see them make the ramen), and when the place gets packed line out the door. It SOO worth the wait. The timing is hit or miss. They first open in the morning for lunch that time always count on line. The whole small hole in the wall love because look where the restaurant located understand.  The food all the ramen is good. Shoyu Ramen I die for!! The flavor is spot on the depth nice light broth and depending if order additional topping can be hearty noodle dish. I prefer couple extras. Other thing find must really perfect compliment too big bowl of ramen is gyoza. It steamed perfectly then seared off on flat top too perfection and the filling is tasty. The gyoza sauce optional but must only way too have it combine together is divine.   They other sides I order the kim chee good but stand out is kim chee fried rice. It could ordered big bowl of that if they had it on the menu. =( It not over spicy but just the right amount of balance. They even have one beer offer on tap never think see small the place is never been good one too. I not remember name of it. Sorry.  The service is excellent. All the servers are very friendly and attentive. The prices are really reasonable. It light healthy tasty any time meal! =))) If never been say give it try!!!",

We stumbled upon this amazing place through yelp since we are from San Diego and we were unfamiliar with the area we usually mainly stay on the stripe when were in vegas but today was different we wanted to get away from the crazy scene and do something else and boy am I glad we did!   We came during a weird time around 230/300 so the place was pretty empty but I'm sure during lunch and dinner they are packed considering they only have a handful of tables. When you enter you instantly smell the delicious broth. We were welcomed and seated instantly. When we looked at the menu I was surprised to see that the Menu was small! It only had about 4 entrees and half Of them were ramen with the other half side dishes so instantly I knew that this place was going to be delicious since they only specialized on one type of dish! i got the miso ramen while my fiance got the tonkatsu (did I spell that right? Lol) ramen. Both were delicious it's ridiculous how much flavor the broth had! Hands down the best ramen place that I have tried so far!   As for service I have no complaints either everyone was friendly and greeted us when we entered and when we left! Like I said this place is a MUST now for us whenever we are in vegas and I can't wait till I go back again!   Side note: when we got back to our hotel room after eating here we turned on the food channel and they happened to be on tv! I thought it was a pretty funny coincidence but it just goes to show how yummy this place is! (:",

There was a little bit of a wait (maybe 3 minutes total) but there's a milk tea place next door and seats for waiting. Anywho, I ordered Shoyu ramen with no pork and added nori to it. My partner had miso ramen and added nori. We ordered white rice and kimchi to share. The napa cabbage kimchi is fresh and not overly fermented, and my ramen was flavorful and delicious. A pretty good sized bowl too! For all of this (2 bowls of ramen, rice, kimchi, one drink) it cost less than $20 before the tip. I've tried one other ramen place in Las Vegas' Chinatown and this one beats it by leaps and bounds. So good I came back the next day!! Same great experience with the spicy ramen.",

    "text": "I arrived at around 1pm for lunch after working a 12 hour graveyard shift. As I pulled into the parking lot a bum approached the front of my car and stopped me, he asked me to roll down my window, I could smell the alcohol coming off his breath mixed with the smell of unwashed body... after explaining to me that he \"wasn't lying and telling the truth\" and needed three dollars to get on a bus to take his \"kid' (pointing at a wall where no one was) home I told him I had no cash... after staring at me for a moment deciding what to do about that I cut him off and told him to have a good day and good luck... and then proceeded to try to find a new parking spot as someone went around me and took the good parking spot that I was aiming for before I was approached by said bum!......  I have read reviews and you really don't understand how small this place is from reading them. the size of the bedroom... I mean... their dining area... is smaller then the size of my master bedroom.... You could not fit two king sized beds in the main dining room area. after getting over that shock, I signed in and proceeded to wait. after about 20 minutes four people from the bar area left and I was seated...  Now I'm a bigger dude. I push about 290 on a good day and the stool i was on was uncomfortable and flimsy but for some miracle it didn't break!  I ordered a mini Mentaiko and a Tonkotsu Ramen. The Mentaiko was actually very tasty, those eggs do give a good spicy kick, but once I mixed everything up with the rice and added some soy sauce it wasn't long before it was gone.  The Ramen was flavorful , I added more chashu pork, nitamago (hard boiled egg) and nori to the bowl when I ordered. The broth had a ton of flavor to it. I really did like it. however, I noticed that the noodles are pre-packaged and did not have any sustenance to them they were a little bit of a let down and I wasn't really into them but they didn't take away from, nor add anything of value to the soup broth itself.   The Chashu Pork was melt in your mouth good. I don't think it was worth the extra 2.95 for the extra two paper thin slices though. however, the extra cost for the 1.50 for the egg was definitely worth it and to be honest, the server I had was actually really nice and she worked really hard to make sure everyone was happy which I really liked to see. after paying in cash...  I ended up getting most of it to go and I just finished the last bit of it while writing this review... (for some reason after re-heating it actually tastes more flavorful! that's kinda odd)...  I would recommend giving Monta at least a try... it's not spectacularly good but it's good enough that I'd come back and try some of the other broths.. I have been to Ichiza for Ramen too. (just up the road from this place heading east) and if I had to compare the both I'd say that Monta comes out on top in terms of the quality of the broth... if I could get Monta Broth with Ichiza Noodles it'd probably be the perfect bowl of Ramen.  I've subtracted 1 star for just how small this place is and the fact that if you go by yourself you'll pretty much be forced to sit on the uncomfortable stools that promise either a fun trip to the ground if they break or a sore ass by the time you're done. I also subtracted 1 star because I didn't particularly care for their noodles.  When you go, hopefully you won't be accosted by the homeless in the area, seems to be a lot of them hanging out around popular places trying to find \"bus fare\"",

Their broth is so good and the flavors of each of their ramen bowls are all savory and distinct from one another. I prefer the thick wavy noodles opposed to the thin ones, but they allow you to substitute any of the ramen with a different noodle type. The pork belly is my favorite and is definitely one of the reasons why I keep coming back to this place. Sometimes I'll add an egg or butter to my ramen bowl, which adds extra texture.   Their chasha bowl is also really good if you don't like ramen. The meat is really tender and juicy and they give you a perfect amount of rice to go with it.",

    "text": "What a great find in Las Vegas! Initially, I didn't come here with much expectations because no other ramen places I've been to have impressed me as much as Ramen Dojo in NorCal. Knowing that the capacity of Monta Noodle House fit around 20 or so customers, I anticipated a wait so arrived 30 minutes before opening on a Friday afternoon. Arriving early got me a table right at opening...yay to that! so COME EARLY to avoid waiting.   Monta Noodle House offers three different kinds of broth but I got a recommendation from one of their regular customers to order the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth! The standard bowl comes with noodles, bamboo shoots, onions, and two pieces of pork. I wanted the ultimate ramen experience so I added on some extra stuff to spice up my bowl - I added the soft boiled egg (a must for every ramen bowl!), sweet yellow corn and shredded green onions (MUST add - gives great flavoring to the whole bowl). I also garnished my ramen bowl with the togarashi chili powder and sesame seeds! The addition of sesame seeds in the bowl was just perfect =) I have to say the best part about this place is the ramen that they used - the noodles were so soft & the thickness was about the size of egg noodles but with a softer texture. I definitely enjoyed this.They also give you plenty of noodles to fill you up real GOOD!   If you're ever craving ramen in Las Vegas and can wake up early enough after a night of partying..remember to check this place out! It's located in Chinatown so having a rental car is convenient. Solid 4 stars for satisfaction and it's location in VEGAS!!  FYI: I also heard that the kimchee fried rice was also good to try.   Happy Eating =)",

    "text": "Way over-hyped.  From the Bay Area with tons of great ramen shops here, this joint is way below standards by comparison.  Nevertheless, this shop is in Las Vegas so you got to take what you have available here.  Their \"basic\" ramen choices are very bland unless you order a lot of the extras.  If you want something tasty, plan on layering all the extras, otherwise it is not worth it.  My family paid $40 for taxi rides to and from our hotel with this place and it definitely wasn't worth it.  Place is super small so not a lot of tables for their customers.  We went on a night that was not crowded.  Service was friendly.  If it wasn't for this, I would rate this a one star.",

At first, Monta looks reliable, its not too big and is in a very small and overlooked spot, which most good eats usually are.  You walk in and it gives you a very homie feeling, despite its small size.    If you love ramen, this is the place to go!  The ramen is cooked to perfection and includes all the added ingredients that make any ramen craver beyond satisfied!  My personal favorite is the tonkotsu ramen with nitamago and a side of their gyoza!  Sooo Ono!  Definitely a must visit!",

    "text": "I want to start by subtracting the one star because the restaurant was uncomfortably hot - at least where I was seated, it was. I was at the end of the bar practically inside the kitchen. There was a wait, as usual, but as usual, the wait is worth it. I brought a ramen enthusiast friend from out of town. He ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with egg and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with mustard greens. We also split an order of the pork belly over rice. LET ME TELL YOU. This pork belly over rice was so silky and delicious that I didn't want my ramen anymore. I didn't even need the pork belly. The oils and the flavors of the pork just sinks into the rice and the rice alone is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The ramen is no joke either. The texture of the noodles stays perfect throughout the entire meal. They don't become so bloated with soup that they turn into mush. I hate mushy noodles. My friend ate his entire ramen bowl down to the last drop of soup! Now heed this warning: The portion sizes are not of America! If you think you are going to get this huge bowl of unfinishable noodles and broth, YOU'RE A GLUTTON. The portion size is just right and leaves you with JUST enough room for you to share an appetizer and have a cup of tea. This isn't the type of place for socializing. Eat your noodles and GTFO so that all of the other hopeful patrons can share a piece of the heaven that you have just experienced.",

    "text": "I'm so glad my gf found this place on yelp for our final lunch at Vegas!  We ordered: - Tonkatsu Ramen: Absolutely wonderful smooth & milky pork-based broth. My favorite ramen is at shin sen gumi, and this bowl of ramen was very comparable, if not better. I also added toppings of a hard boiled egg and extra slices of pork - they gave 6 extra slices in addition to the two slices of pork that came with the bowl by default. I decided to avoid the kimchi because I didn't want the Korean toppings to dominate the Japanese broth. Noodles were cooked perfect, and you can order extra noodles for $1.50. - Shoyu Ramen: This is the darker one, I believe it's miso/soy based. My gf had this, and I tried the broth and it seemed equally as delicious. - Gyoza: It's like lightly grilled potstickers - Fried Rice: typical fried rice as expected - not something to die for, but good. - Kimchi Fried Rice: Pretty much exactly like the fried rice, except that it had a bit of the tangy flavor that the kimchi added - Pork bellow bowl: This was my favorite out of the fried rice bowls. Lightly cooked, tender, moist and juicy pork belly strips layered on top of white rice. Definitely worth getting along with the ramen.  Service was fantastic. Our group of 5 was sixth on the waitlist, but it moved pretty fast; we waited maybe about 20 or so minutes.  Cliff Notes: Tonkatsu Ramen with hardboiled egg and extra pork. Pork Belly bowl.",

They put 2 small slices of meat and thats it. You have to pay for an egg and any other garnish. Theres only 4-5 small tables so just because theres a line outside doesn't mean its good.

They were easily the best bowl of ramen at the festival.  They took on Tsujita, Zagat rated and the best LA has to offer, and stood toe to toe.  I work in the Westside, so I eat at Tsujita a couple of times a month.  Monta gave them a run for their money with fine, al dente noodles, half a perfectly cooked onsen tamago, and an unctuous broth that was rich and flavorful without being too heavy.  Monta easily beat the two heavy hitters from Japan - Mattou Seimen, three time Tokyo Ramen Festival champion, and Tatsu No Ya, the #1 ramen shop in Kyushu.  Monta also took out a personal favorite, Shalala Ramen from my native NorCal, and a Googler staple.  (Shalala's Mountain View shop is 5 minutes from the Googleplex.)  Shinsengumi Hakata Ramen?  Not even a contender.  Monta Ramen is now on my short list of must-eat places in Las Vegas, along with Japanese Curry Zen.",

It wasn't quite as rich or flavorful as pork broth, but I was pleased to note that salt was kept to a minimum without compromising flavor (I also begged them to lighten up on the salt). I love ramen as a meal. Its cheap, fast,  and totally filling, not to mention tasty.   We split a gyoza app, which was super greasy. Would probably skip that one. My husband felt like the 105 heat was too much for warm soup, so he opted for cold ramen noodles in a sesame dressing, which I also thought was absolutely delic. The menu is pretty limited so be prepared to eat ramen. So excited to find a good ramen place in Vegas. Skip the overpriced strip eateries and head to Chinatown for yummy, reasonably priced food.",

I had the tonkotsu, but since my mom ordered the tonkotsu shoyu and my grandma had the shoyu, I was able to sample 3 out of the 4 available soups. The soup has a clean flavor and isn't as kotteri (fatty) as what you find at Santouka (my fave ramen joint). The noodles are also very thin - like angel hair pasta. The chasiu is definitely a standout and meltingly tender. I also ordered a small fried rice and it was delicious and quite literally glistening.  We came here around 1:30 on Saturday afternoon and scored the last 3 seats at the counter. As others have mentioned it is a very small restaurant, but most people eat their noodles and go so turnover is fast. Definitely a great place to check out in Vegas for some authentic ramen!",

I noticed a lot of bad reviews are due to the size and service of the restaurant as opposed to the food. But everytime I've came here I have never had that problem.   First of all, if you know this place is going to be small I wouldn't suggest bringing large groups. Everytime I've been here was with only one other person when I've had a craving for good ramen and some Japanese beer. With that said I've always been able to get a seat without having to wait too long and my food has always come out speedy, fresh, and fantastic.   The tonkatsu-shoyu ramen is awesome and if you'd rather opt out of the mixed broth they are both good stand alone too. There are a lot of toppings you can add to your soup which is pretty awesome also.   Great place for anyone to check out, but just remember the size capacity issue when trying out this place!",

We ended up ordering 2 miso Ramen, as they contain the least amount of sodium, and we both were surprised at how they could end up making this one of the SALTEST broths we'd both ever tasted.. the worst part about it was it wasn't even ramen noodles.. it was the type of noodles they use in Chinese pan fried noodles..(thin egg noodles instead of wheat noodles)  which surprised both of us. I honestly wouldn't go back just because of this fact. The broths are just too darn salty...",

    "text": "I went to Vegas recently for a mini-getaway, and being the crazy ramen aficionados that we are, my boyfriend and I HAD to come here and try this place during our trip.  We both ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen with extra chashu and hard-boiled (more like deliciously and perfectly soft-boiled!) egg.  The broth was absolutely delicious--just the right amount of flavor and rich pork fatty goodness to make it taste perfect!  Even though it was 103 degrees outside, I didn't care.  I ate and drank the entire bowl clean.  Gluttony at its finest.  Woo!  I was extremely impressed with the quality and texture of their chashu.  It was marinated just right and they really did cook it for hours to get it to really melt in my mouth!  The moment I bit into a piece, I didn't even really have to chew at all...it immediately disintegrated into orgasmic morsels of ecstasy and rocked a party in my mouth!  The egg was perfection...just the way all ramen \"hard-boiled\" (I still think they should call them \"soft-boiled\"...it just suits the texture better!) eggs should be.  The yolk was nice and and gooey and soft.  It complimented the ramen broth so well!  Needless to say, I wolfed down the entire bowl in about 10 minutes or less. hehe ^_^    We also got an order of the regular fried rice, and the only thing I can say is that it is THE BEST Japanese fried rice I have EVER had in my life thus far (in the States).  The rice was so extremely flavorful and light (because too much oil is a no-no).  Sprinkled with those little slices of heaven known as their chashu and plenty of pickled ginger, it tasted PHENOMENAL.  That was the 2nd party that rocked my mouth in one sitting!  Boy, what an awesomely dining experience!  Exquisite ramen.  Good price.  Great service.  Will most DEFINITELY have to visit again whenever we're in the area.  Oh, and my brother (who doesn't eat pork) also came with us.  He ordered the kimchi (or spicy?) fried rice without the pork and REALLY enjoyed his food.  He was even full off just that one single plate, so their portions are very reasonable, considering the elephant-sized appetite that he has.",

I got the shoyu ramen and added nori, egg, and char sui.  Yes, I missed ramen.  The portion was completely decent.  The char sui was a waste of additional money I felt because the pork was way too fatty and broke apart too much in the soup.  Not worth the trouble, especially when there was no particularly special flavor to it.  They serve canned iced green tea which was delicious as well.",

It was way past normal dinner time but there was still a line to get in.  It took 40 minutes before we got our table.  There was a dust storm that evening so waiting outside was pretty special.      The inside is small and not very impressive and gives you the feel of eat and get out soon as possible.   The service was pretty good despite being busy.  We ordered our ramen and a pork belly bowl.  The pork belly bowl with rice was pretty good.  The marinated Tender and tasty marinated pork was a hit with all of us.      The Ramen arrived and I got the Spicy Tonkotsu which when I mixed in the red spicy paste  made the broth nice and thick.  I really enjoyed the taste and devoured my ramen as if my life depended on it.  The broth had a great taste and the added on egg made it even better.  The daughter got the black garlic ramen which I didn't care for.  So the Spicy Tonkotsu is my recommendation as I am craving it as I write this review.  I do think my next visit will be to pick up as the wait can be crazy at times.",

I tried the tonkatsu shoyu ramen, but asked them to switch to thick chewy noodles since that's the way I like it. Hungover Aileen enjoyed the broth very much and it wasn't too salty, which is much appreciated. The noodles were the perfect texture. The chasu was also incredibly tender and just the right portion for me since I was able to get some in every bite of noodles.

    "text": "If you are in Vegas, it doesn't matter if you have a rental car or have to call for taxi/uber/lyft, you need to go here now. To be honest, this plaza is LOADED with SO many gems (Raku, Kabuto, etc!), it would be shameful if you do not come to this mini plaza. My goodness, I could go on a food tour just in this plaza alone. I only had time for one ramen shop visit, and I debated hard between Monta and another. In the end, I have absolutely no regrets and this was my favorite, albeit, shortest meal during my most recent Vegas visit.   Monta Ramen rivals among the best ramen joints in the US. For the locals who think that this place is just aiteeeee, I'm jealous of y'all! The black garlic tonkotsu is just dripping with richness and FLAVOR - one of the best bowls I've ever had. The spicy tonkotsu, while also great, is my second favorite - flavor wise, it is comparable to Ippudo's akamaru modern. My first bite into the perfectly firm al dente noodles put me on cloud nine. It's the little things in life, you know?   When you factor in the price of this place, the value is almost no comparison to most ramen joints in the US. Monta's prices are almost similar to ramen shops in Japan, that is to say that it is EXTREMELY affordable. It's a hole in the wall with fast, efficient service - the best kind of ramen joint if you ask me. Go have a bowl of ramen (or two), and with the extra money you've saved, go to Kung Fu Tea or Snowflake next door.",

Pork broth was buttery, thin noodles were fresh and pork was tender. Added an egg and corn which made my bowl complete!  Pork belly bowl was yummy and great for sharing.   Although the place was packed and super busy, the 2 waitresses managed to get things done! They took our orders, refill drinks, take empty bowls and plates and clean up for the next party quickly and efficient.  Would love to come back next time we are in town!",

Some love it and some don't care for it as much. But if you like creamy bone broth Japanese style ramen this is the place to go!!! It's a small hole in the wall and in tends to be packed especially during lunch hours and on weekends but boy is it worth the wait!!! I know some people aren't willing to wait for \"just a bowl of soup\" but buddy this is no ordinary bowl of soup!!! If you like it spicy get the spicy tonkotsu and if you like it less creamy ask for the half chicken half pork. Oh and their pork belly fried rice is the fantabulous!!! Happy eating ^-^",

We both love eating Ramen, but we're unsure about this one.  We don't love it, but we don't hate it either. The noodles tasted hard and half-cooked; left a starchy taste in our mouth. Broth was ok.

(Saying this from experience living in Japan, etc.)  The ramen noodles were bland and honestly, I think they might be using somen noodles rather than ramen noodles given how the koedama sticked together. There was no tare oil on top of the shoyu broth they delivered to me for the shoyu ramen, adding to the blandness. Also, the shoyu ramen was not translucent like it should be if they were using proper Shoyu broth. Also, seeing how the chefs appear to be cooking the noodles ahead of time rather than to order show me they do not care for their product like they need to.  Not returning.",

The ramen soup is great and very comforting during the winter months. The tonkatsu soup base is very rich. The shoyu is lighter if that is your preference. Place is really small so there was a short wait even at 4 pm and they usually have a line before opening.   Highly recommend.",

Hubby also ordered the pork belly fried rice which was not as good as how it was prepared at their other branch which was chunks of pork. This was slices of pork belly and the dish didn't taste as good.   The food is served very fast so even 'tho there is a wait, even longer for larger groups 4 or more, the turn over is quick.",

We got lucky when they opened and we were seated with first group of patrons.  Staff was friendly and prompt to take orders to which they were seated thorough the ramen house. While waiting to order we had the seat next to the kitchen. It was artful to see the chef prepare the ramen bowls for the orders. A process to insure the bowls were clean. A process to make all bowls of an order. A process to continue the broth and insure each bowl is consistent irregardless of when made. Chef tasted the broths as being made so nothing would be off. Chef insured all ramen noodles were consisted from each bowl.   My order was the Tonkotsu shoyo ramen garlic pork added egg. Others in my group ordered the black ramen and one substituted their protein for chicken. The order didn't take long for the ramen master to artfully prepare and have wait staff deliver. The broth was made from pork or chicken.  The dishes arrived with the noodles, protein, broth, spices, vegetables, and spoons all fashionably placed in the bowl. With those who added egg, the egg was sitting on top. Tender noodles through. Broth was well layered and spicy in it's own. I still added some because I love the kick. Cha shu was not overly fatty. Egg was more cooked than I like. I enjoyed the bowl. I left no broth.  Aside from egg, I enjoyed the bowl and would love to visit again someday. Worth the drive out.",

It's located in a small lot so plan ahead for parking.. and definitely plan ahead for the wait! It's a small place. The shortest I have waited for a table was 20-30 mins, and that was at lunch time about 10 mins after it opened. The menu is pretty simple, you have a choice of the flavor of broth, it lists the ingredients in it, you can choose the thickness of the noodle or if you want it cold, you can have add-ons, and there are a few side plates which includes diff rice and meat for those who aren't fans of ramen. The waitresses move really fast and the wait time for your food to come out is very short. Definitely my go to place when I need ramen!",

I got something close to water. I'm just quite shocked that ramen soup could taste like that considering it's stock is made from bones and veggies. The noodles had this residual flour taste as well. Overall I was just really shocked to get such a tasteless ramen soup which lacked umami. I don't know, if I go for the regular soup it's just too salty to taste anything, and if I ask for less salty it tastes like water. I guess the base is just... like that... It's sad considering their Sister shop ramen Kobo is REALLY GOOD and has nice flavours as well as salt levels. It just wasn't delicious and it made my entire dinner experience really disappointing.  Other than that, the gyoza was delicious and had a nice ginger flavour to it.",

I would recommend ordering extra noodles and extra pork; I ordered extra pork and I'm glad I did!  Next time I will probably add an egg, too.  Three of us ate for under $30, which is pretty good!  It is very affordable and you are definitely getting a good bang for your buck.  My advice is to sit at the counter if you can.  The wait for a table may end up being long and your meal comes out so quickly that you *probably* won't be sitting on the stool long.  We ate at the counter and survived ;)  The wait staff was super friendly and kept our glasses of water full without us even noticing.  I honestly cannot wait to go back!",

With that said, I will admit I am kind of picky when it comes to ramen.  This place is located near the Chinatown center off the strip.  It's really easy to find and I was really craving some noodles!  It's a cute little joint with super Japanesey workers.  It smells pretty amazing when you walk in, and the menu is small which is nice :)    I had the Tonkotsu Ramen (it's their most popular) with an order of gyoza.  The broth is a little bit on the thicker side but not bad ( a tad heavy on the salt). It definitely tastes better if you sprinkle some of the spicy powder on top.  Personally for me, the noodles weren't anything special.  The gyoza was very disappointing for me as well...I didn't even finish it.  The service was good and the food was alright.  Overall, if you're really craving ramen this place will do the job, but I don't know if I'd call it slurp it up good.",

    "text": "During my last 3 visits here to MONTA I did not see even one Japanese person eating or waiting in the 2 hour long line. Do you know why it is that the Japanese community in LV has turned their back on MONTA? There are many reasons.....  I was confused. I was really confused. Why was I not a fan of MONTA? Every Chinese person kept telling me that MONTA was \"the best\". Every Korean woman kept telling me that it was \"the best\". Even their white husbands kept telling me that MONTA is \"the best\". My Mexican-American and Black foster kids kept telling me that Monta was \"the best\". Why is it that I didn't like it when everyone around me kept saying that it was the greatest? Am I just not Japanese enough to enjoy MONTA? My Dad is a 3rd generation Japanese-American and he did marry a Korean woman, so maybe that Korean blood in me erased my ability to determine what a good ramen is. But then I started noticing that all my friends and business partners who were born and raised in Japan kept insisting that MONTA was NOT \"the best\", In fact they thought it was \"the worst\". So I came to the conclusion that Japanese people just don't like MONTA like everyone else does.   Personally, I think MONTA is  the California Roll of Ramen. It's a slightly Americanized variation, just like how the California Roll is an Americanized variation of traditional Maki. MONTA's ramen belongs to no True Japanese region.  It's made in America like Burgers and Fries.   No one eats comfortably at MONTA. The place is extremely cramped, the chairs are very uncomfortable. The counter is made of that cheap plywood you find at discount furniture outlets on Maryland and Flamingo.  The bathroom is like 4 feet from the bar, and some guy always insists on taking a huge dump and leaving the door open. There is never any parking in the lot. Frequently, I just drive across the street to Shuseki(A Chinese-Japanese restaurant) where it's much more comfortable and the ramen is f*cking awesome.  MONTA is the most popular ramen-ya in Vegas, so why won't they move to a larger space? One of the wealthy Korean business owners who is a member of my Asian-American Activism agency informed me that Seoul Plaza(where Monta is located) has the cheapest rent in Chinatown.  The owner of MONTA is attempting to cut costs to maximize profits and that's why he won't leave Seoul Plaza.  Cheapness is the main reason! And Cheapness is also the reason why your bowl of ramen at MONTA is only half the size of the other 4 major Ramen-Ya's in LV. And Cheapness is why you have to pay extra for every little thing. You gotta pay extra for noodles, you gotta pay extra for the egg, you gotta pay extra for butter and corn! How cheap is that!!! If you get all the add ons, the bowl of ramen comes out to like $15.00. You can get the egg, extra charsu, extra noodles, 50% more broth, corn, butter, and garlic oil all included in the $8.00-$9.00 bowl of ramen at Fukumimi. The Deluxe Ramen at Sora also has everything included and it's only like $10.00 flat.  The f*cking hipsters! This is a major reason why the Japanese have left MONTA.  Hipsters are usually White people, but they think it's cool to hang out in latino areas or Chinatowns. I don't know why, but hipsters think it's \"lame\" being around other Whites. Unfortunately, they have chosen MONTA as their \"COOL MINORITY HANGOUT SPOT!\". As a Japanese-American, do I wanna sit with a bunch of guys with \" David Lynch Eraserhead\" haircuts who wear Geek-Sheek  glasses and talk about their feelings? Do I wanna sit with a 6 foot 4\" man in a dress who is attempting to start a conversation with me about: Indie Rock, Indie Flicks,  Jesus(aka Obama), Apple Products, and how cool it is to wear sunglasses indoors?  My response= THAT'S IT! NO MORE!  I'M F*CKING OUT OF HERE! I'M GOING TO FUKUMIMI!  By the way... How f*cking long does it take for you guys to eat one bowl of ramen? While I'm on the waiting list for over 1 hour, I always notice how people finish their ramen after 15 minutes but just sit there and talk for another 45 minutes. This is the reason why we gotta wait so f*cking long to get a seat.   MONTA has the worst Gyoza in LV. It tastes like the Chinese variation, and they all stick together like they are frozen(look at my pics). And they give you like 5 pieces for $5.00. That's like a dollar a piece!! Walk 2 minutes to Shuseki for a much better gyoza.  Why did my egg come from the Alley? They ran out of eggs during my last visit and then they ran into the alley and grabbed another box? Are the eggs just sitting out there in some kind of big jar?  A Japanese restaurant is supposed to have Kim-Uchi, not Kimchi. I saw with my own eyes, the cook here at MONTA going to Greenland to buy one of those giant glass jars of Korean Kimchi. At Fukumimi, Katsu-San makes his own Kim-Uchi which is slightly sweeter than Korean Kimchi. It's a True Japanese variation of a classic Korean dish.    #$@!*$#%$ *%#!

I had been here many times prior with no issues about seating but their seating system is TERRIBLE and forced me and my friends to leave and go to RAMEN SORA.   Let me explain: They will NOT seat you unless your full party is present. Okay I get that-- that's fine. But my friend called and said she was going to be 30 min late and to go ahead and start eating and she would join us.   WELL.. That is NOT allowed at Monta. They follow strict rules and would rather have you LEAVE than seat you at a table (that seats four people) and have your remaining party join you.   SO in essence, if you're seated at a table with 2 extra seats you CANNOT have anyone come in and sit down and join you.   I was told that my friend would have to re-check in and wait. (?? that doesn't even make sense)   SORRY MONTA, but the hassle is definitely not worth it. I'd rather get my fill ELSEWHERE. I left immediately after they didn't negotiate seating.   -angry yelper.",

    "text": "This is a small ramen shop in the back of a little plaza, there were people waiting outside before I got there (about 9:15pm on a Saturday night), and an even longer line by the time we ate and left (10:30pm). This is typical of ramen restaurants - the service was friendly and pretty quick (minus the waiting for a table part), but the reason for the 3-stars is the incredibly salty broth. I love ramen and have eaten at some of the best places in LA, and this just cannot compare. The noodles and toppings are fine, but the broth is so salty (and almost thick) that I couldn't even drink it. Perhaps it gets salter when it's later in the day, but I would not want to go back.",

I don't go to noodle houses too often, but when I do, I'm all about the sauces, aromas, and textures.  The food was a bit bland to me, with all flavors blending into one another.  The egg on top didn't add much to it.  They did have some good appetizers like their fried rice and pot stickers, but I give just one thumb up for the noodles.  The nice part is that there are plenty of add ons for your dish.  I just wish there was more of a punch to the broth because for me, it was mostly just salty.",

Char siu melts in your mouth, broth is incredibly rich, and it's difficult to spend $15 there, including a beer.  Also have enjoyed several of their special ramens -- check the board.  If you're a miso ramen fan (I'm not, but the wife is), probably want to check out Ramen Sora instead. And I tend to steer clear of the sides at Monta -- not because they're bad, but because they are average, and I can focus on the ramen, which is what they do best.",

I frequent this spot every other week, and not once have I been served anything below standard. It's so good my heart goes insane whenever someone mentions we should go get Ramen. I want to cry when I'm done. I get so full after a meal there that I usually don't need to eat anything for hours.   Having a small menu guarantees the food is quality and fresh. No nonsense of having a hard time trying to figure out what you want to eat. The soup is hearty and filling, the chashu topping is so amazing, nicely sliced. I always get egg with my ramen and a cold beer. Aside from the ramen, the fried rice is amazing, gyoza is on point.   Not a good place for big parties, tables usually fit four, and there aren't a lot of tables. They also don't take reservations. Personally, I prefer to eat at the bar, facing the chefs in the kitchen. So I can stare and watch and drool waiting for my food... WAITING.... Speaking of waiting, you don't need to wait long. Food comes out of the kitchen very fast.  Writing this review is making me upset, I want to go and eat more ramen.....",

    "text": "Very good ramen.  I've been here about five times and I like the tonkotsu the best, which is pork bone broth.  But it is very filling.  Right now, they are offering the tonkotsu mixed with the shoyu broth.  It has pieces of pork and the tonkotsu noodles.  This is a little less filling but does not have enough of the pork taste for me.  My husband prefers the noodles in the shoyu so we might try to get those noodles in the tonkotsu/shoyu.  We shall see.  I have not tried the miso as most people tell me it is very thick and salty.  I can't tear myself away from the tonkotsu - it is so good!  I'll just stick with that.  I highly recommend getting the takana mustard leaf in your ramen.  It is very, very flavorful.  Also, they have containers of fresh garlic and ginger scattered about the place.  If there isn't one on your table, just ask.  It's a great addition to the ramen if you are a fan of garlic and/or ginger.  Free addition to the ramen! The gyoza is good too, but keep in mind, you will likely be surprisingly full after just some ramen.  If the place is crowded, they will set up a waitlist that you have to write your name on.  It's outside taped to a table by the door.  If they are really busy, they may not stop to explain this to you, so just keep an eye out for the list if the place is full.  It's True, as some of the reviewers say, that it is unbearably hot inside the restaurant during the summer. But they are good with the beverage refills (Asahi on tap!) and just be thankful you don't have to work there all day! Plus, when it was too warm inside, the turnover was quick so the wait for a table was shorter.  Now that it is colder outside, it seems like people linger and chat.  But still, turnover is decent so if there is a wait, don't despair.  You need to spend $10 minimum to use a credit card.",

Yes, you will likely have to stand around the door before you get to eat,  yes, you may have to sit by some suspiciously tipsy dude if you're up at the counter,  and yes, you might not even be impressed, despite what Yelp and your hipster friend says.  But that's all okay, I promise, it is what it is. It really is great ramen.   Monta is definitely worth the visit. It's not the best ramen ever, with the chashu a bit too fatty, the miso a bit too salty upfront sometimes, and the gyoza totally unremarkable. But the broth is hot, delicious, and flavorful, and the noodles are top-notch. It's good, okay? Go.",

I had ramen in college and it was not a thing I would like... go out to eat for.\" I was promptly  A) mocked, as is right and proper, and then B), informed I needed to go to Monta, order the tonkotsu shoyu ramen, and then report back.  It was sort of a life changing experience.  Pros: - The ramen is soooo goood. I crave it now. Its silky and rich and somehow creamy and succulent and like everything chicken soup ever dreams of being, but it's got pork in it and....auuuhgh....want. - The price is right. Two bowls of ramen, 2 asahi, about $20. That's a date night right there. - Once you get a seat, service is fast, and all the servers are super nice. - Menu had everything spelled out for a ramen-noob rather than making me guess.  Cons: - The wait to get seated can be kind of a bummer sometimes, but on a cool winter night, it almost just whets the appetite. - The tonkotsu shoyu is so good I haven't had the heart to try anything new on the menu. I should probably rectify that.  Overall: I just convinced myself I need ramen for dinner.",

We also ordered the gyoza which was nothing to brag about. I actually found it a bit bland. It was not served with any dumpling or housemade sauce so we had it plain since the soy sauce combination was not working. The ramens came out very quickly and ramen were cooked perfectly. The soup broth was very flavorful and the two slices of pork belly basically melts in your mouth.  Overall, the ramens were good, and cheap. However, the gyoza was nothing special.",

From the existing reviews, it sounded like I needed to try the Tonkotsu Ramen. I'm glad I did because it was absolutely delicious. The broth is amazing and all the ingredients worked together to provide a satisfying ramen experience. Of course, I had to add egg because that's just my thing.

After finally giving in to my week long craving of ramen, I decided to go with Monta because it was previously my favorite ramen spot. But I think I have given up on this place. I called in an order when I got off of work that way by the time I get there, it would be done. So I walk in right at 930 (the time I said I was gna be there), and not only was my to go order not ready yet, not a single person acknowledged me. I had to walk up to the ladies standing by the cash register to ask about my order. And that's when I saw one of them start getting it ready. So I wait another 10 minutes or so until it's finally ready and I head on to my way. Once I got home, I realize my ramen didn't even come with the meat!!! I tried to call them, but of course, they don't pick up.  I don't care how good and cheap this place is, I don't think I'll ever be returning. They suck at picking up their phone, they messed up on my food, and I feel like they do enough business to be able to expand yet they leave everyone in this crammed room.",

I had the tonkatsu-shoyu ramen with a side of kimchi.   I don't claim to be a ramen expert, but the broth was flavorful and not as oily as some of the other ramens that I've had. The 2 pork slices that come with the ramen left more to be desired, but didn't take too much away from my overall opinion of the ramen. I ordered a second order of noodles and the consistency was much better than the noodles that came with my order. I like my noodles to be more on the chewy side though. Lastly, the kimchi was a great compliment to the ramen and the garlic/ginger at the table can be used to add more flavor to the ramen.   Overall, a nice place for a quick, cheap and tasty meal.",

    "text": "After night one, we needed soup to help nurse our hangovers.  My friend turned to Yelp and found that Monta had a bunch of reviews and was overall rated four stars.  After dining at Monta and though the price is right, my conclusion is either Vegas lacks great ramen spots or Vegas Yelpers have low expectations for ramen...or maybe even both...  WAIT: Our party of seven arrived a bit after 1pm on a Friday afternoon.  Monta isn't a big place.  They accommodate approximately about 10 people at the bar and another 20-25 seated.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table which in the end, our party of seven had to split into two separate groups to be seated.  FOOD: *Tonkatsu Ramen ($6.95) - Though the broth was tasty and hearty, the noodles totally failed.  The noodles were different from what I am use to and I wasn't a fan of the thin, vermicelli like noodles which made the broth taste starchy the longer they sat there.  Toppings on the noodles were two pieces of chasui, bamboo shoots, green onions, and kikurage mushrooms.  One of our friends ordered the miso ramen and it came with noodles we were more accustomed to.  *Pork Belly Bowl ($3.95 small/$5.75 large) - Delicious!  We ordered a large bowl and shared it with the table.  A generous amount of tasty pork belly is shredded over rice and topped with chopped green onions.  SERVICE: Typical Asian restaurant as you basically order, get your food, and get the bill.  Food took about 15 minutes or so to come out.  PARKING: Private lot",

The egg was like the icing on top. All the flavors came together in perfect harmony and was such a treat to eat. I have eaten here multiple times and is a place that I highly recommend! If you have family coming into town, this is definitely a place that you should bring them to. If you are coming to Vegas then this is also a place you should go and try, it is off the beaten path but it is worth it. Great place and will be back time and time again.",

Tonkatsu, shoyu and miso...oh and a combi of two of the.)   After ordering, even on the busiest nights where there was a short wait, our noodles and gyoza came out in about 3 to 5 minutes, piping hot.   The staff is genuine, the food savory and well done...and the prices are great.

    "text": "Unlike the former US Marine (ahem Tien N.) I give this place four stars. Although I haven't had the opportunity to eat authentic Japanese food in the land ot the rising sun, the food that is served at Monta is nonetheless delicious. If you had food in Japan and expect this place to be 100% authentic then you may be dissapointed. But if you eat it for what it is then I can promise you that you will not be dissappointed.  It's like when you have expectations before you watch a movie at the theatre, then you will most likely be let down. But if you watch it for what it is then you will enjoy it, unless the movie completey sucks.  I had the \"Shoyu Ramen\" with extra noodles, and the additions of the egg and pork. The broth was rich with lots of flavor, but the best part was the pork. It was so succulent and flavorful. I recommend adding the chili powder and the sesame seeds to your soup for even more flavor.  Service was great and the food is served quickly. Only downside is the price, since all toppings for the ramen are extra charge, so by the time you add on 1-3 toppings you're looking at an average price of about $13 for a bowl. The restaurant is also very small, so prepare to wait for a while if the they're busy, which is most of the time.  If you love ramen, authentic or not, definitely check this place out, it'll be worth your time.  Monta Noodle House is so great I vow never to give it up, never let it down, never turn around and desert it. Never going to say good bye and never going to tell a lie...",

    "text": "My first experience with authentic Japanese ramen, and I was not disappointed. Prior to Monta, the only types of ramen I ate were in packages, cups and bowls, usually Korean in descent and instant in nature. So I was surprised, in a good way, when I discovered that Japanese ramen is nothing like the ramen I've eaten before.   My boyfriend was craving ramen for dinner, so I immediately suggested Monta Noodle House after remembering all the positive reviews on Yelp. We entered the restaurant and, thankfully, they had a table for two available. The restaurant itself is small, reminiscent of an authentic ramen house in Japan (at least in my mind). Service was friendly and quick given the ratio of servers to customers.   After reading over the menu, he ordered the Miso Ramen with extra char siu and a Mini Mentaiko while I ordered the Tonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen and an order of Gyoza. Here is the breakdown of the food:  Gyoza- Hot pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings with just the right amount of crisp from the charred skin which contrasted well with the soft and juicy meat filling. Overall, very good and savory.   Miso Ramen- He enjoyed his ramen, saying that it tasted very authentic. I tried some of his ramen, and while I preferred the broth of his ramen, I liked the thinner noodles from my ramen more.   Mini Mentaiko- He enjoyed this as well. I think it was the perfect light contrast to the heavy ramen.   Tonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen- Delicious! The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables added texture and mildness to the rich broth. My only complaints are that the broth was just a tad too salty for my taste and the char siu lacked the meatiness I wanted.   Overall, we enjoyed dinner that night. I enjoyed my experience there so much that two days after my initiation into the Japanese ramen world I went again with my mom.",

    "text": "I took my friend Gerald here when he said he was itching for ramen. At first, I was going to take him to Togishi Ramen (how come I didn't know this place was closed!?!? I'm sooo sad!) but once I discovered that it was closed, we tried this place on a recommendation from a friend. For me, this was my second attempt at this place because the first time it was packed. There's a little bench in front of the restaurant that had at least four people sitting on it and three more people waiting.   When we got there, we were seated immediately. The place was very small and tight, but there was definitely a Japanese feel to it. I ordered the Shoyu ramen with cha shu pork and green onions. Gerald had the same thing but instead of the green onions, he added a soft boiled egg (after I saw his, I wanted an egg too!!!) The service was quick, pleasant and honestly, was what was expected. I was not disappointed.  As for my ramen...it was delicious!!! It was the perfect temperature, had just enough flavor and hit the spot!! I only had two disappointments:   1) The limited menu - I enjoyed what I had, but I think I would have liked to see more choices.  2) Feeling rushed - not by the staff, but by the people who were waiting. They just stood by my table and I felt like they were rushing us because their party was seated right next to me. Not the restaurant's fault, but perhaps they should come up with a seating system or take reservations for large parties or peak periods.   I will definitely try this place again! I give my ramen 4 stars, but until I try something else on their menu, I'll stick with my 3. Yummy ramen if you're craving it!",

We first tried Monta before it received all of its well-deserved notoriety, and were able to get seated right away.  Not anymore; expect long lines until near closing time.  The atmosphere is very authentic, very small and very loud and simultaneously chill.  Service is excellent despite there being only two people working the floor at any given moment.  I always order the miso ramen with extra chasu.  It used to be my favorite until I noticed that it got a little saltier in the last few months.  So I've switched to regular Tonkotsu.  What sets Monta apart, in my opinion, is the melt-in-your-mouth goodness of the chashu, and the depth of the broth.  I consider Monta to be in the top 3 pantheon of ramen in the Western US, besting Daikokuya in Los Angeles and Hakata in Gardena.  You must try this place if you are in Vegas.",

It was just too salty for me now.  I took the noodles and didn't drink the broth.  I had a massive headache immediately after and drank a ton of water. Owies. Since I've gone and cut out processed foods I think I've become sensitive to high sodium.   The cold noodle salad was still pretty good to me though and I took a bite of pork belly bowl which is still one of the yummiest things on rice.  I just can't see myself coming back very often unless I want some cold noodles.",

A bowl of ramen used to fill me up, but I just left there and feel like I need to stop by McDonald's to fill me up.  This is disappointing.

I ordered my ramen \"spicy\" for a dollar extra but they offer sriaracha and chili oil on the side. Next time, I'd rather give them that dollar as a tip and spice my own ramen.

    "text": "Now to start, the reason I gave four stars it because the customer service can be terrible. I once brought 6 friends (all who had never been there before) to try it. There tables are only made to seat 4 at most, and even though there was an empty table and the one next to it had just paid and was ready to leave, instead of waiting 5 minutes and seating us THEY SAT THE EMPTY TABLE. After we had already been WAITING FOR 45 MINUTES, they again wanted us to wait for two tables to clear out at the same time. Not gonna lie, I lost my s***.  Then, to try and make it up to us they tried to offer us bar seats (after I made it perfectly clear in the beginning that we wanted a table) and we just picked up and left. Apparently bringing more than 4 people and asking for a table is too complicated for the waitresses to handle and caused their brains to melt.  Other than that, I have never had a problem with their service there and their ramen is the best I have ever had. Even my half Japanese cousin (who is from Tokyo) said that it's the closest to Japanese ramen you can get in the states. It's always crowded now (a testament to how good it is) so be prepared to wait. But the wait is usually not too long since they get people in and out as fast as they can.  In conclution: Never arrive in a group of more than 4 people (or you will overload the poor waitresses' brains, heaven forbid) and you will have a fabulous dinner. :)",

It almost felt like I was slurping a thin gravy. The charsiu / pork slices was extremely fatty, melted like butter in your mouth. For some, this may be a great thing, but for me it was just a little too much paired with the overly rich broth. It wasn't bad ramen, but nothing about this bowl of ramen stood out. The kimchee fried rice and gyoza was a little lackluster too.",

As soon as we arrived, a waitress came to get drinks order from us. When we got drinks the other waitress came to our table  in a minute after and tried to get orders. even though, we didn't have enough time to order, we tried not to take so long time. Since three of us are working as server in japanese restaurants for while. For sure, we weren't taking lots of  time to order. but this waitress was giving us mean look and had negative attitude.  We ordered pork belly rice, fried rice, one pot sticker, two tonkotsu shoyu ramen with egg, one miso ramen with egg, and one miso ramen without egg. Cook made a mistake and  put an egg on both of miso ramen. It was totally fine with us because sometimes people make mistakes. Moreover, we got an free egg, but the problem was waitress's attitude.  I definitely remeber that she never apologized to us but said that \"chef made a mistake, you guys can have it\" and turned around and left.  That happening embrassed everyone of us and we thought we did something wrong to server or etc.   After we all finished our meal, she just \"dropped\" check on our table. We tried to split in five ways, but we left four cards on a bill and talked to each other that \"we gotta leave maximum 2 or 3cards.... Its too much\" and so on. But this mean look waitress came to us and saw four cards stacked on a bill ( actually, we had five people in a group but one person did not left her card on a bill, so total we left four cards at the first place ) And said 10 bucks minimum to swipe and go throw, understand?? With annoying face Then left  We TOTALLY all felt insulted and humiliated.Qh  Because our total was 53.xx dollars which means we can leave all five cards to split and she was the one who dropped a bill on our table. ( we assumed that she knows about the total. ) she just did not like to split five cards and mentioned it to us to do less work.   So, I know it was really mean to do it ( we know this is very annoying when servers get more than 3 cards to split ) but we left five cards on a bill, but while she was working on our bill, my friend said that she is keep staring at us. ( i was sitting toward windows so i actually couldnt see that )   I normally leave 20-30% tip whenever i get enough service and qualified food, but i told my friends to leave 0 tip and i left 0 tip too.   As soon as, we left restaurant the other waitress came to us and asked \"something wrong with service?\"  I replied \"i didnt like the service\"  I expected her to ask \"such as??\" or what did you guys dislike about ?   BUT she said \"ok bye\" and went back to the restaurant.   Ok bye bye. I never gonna recommend this restaurant for my life and also my friends will not.  I will definitely gonna tell anybody who wants to visit here that this restaurant has the poorest service.   YOU waitress ! (I know one day you will read this and remind about us )  I also work as a server in japanese restaurant and sometimes you can not provide service to cusotmers as normal. But shaking head in front of customers while you saw 5 cards stacked on a bill??  and staring at customers while spliting five bills?? Really??   Future customers, this restaurant has really good food with reasonable price, but sometimes you wont treated as customer. So careful.",

The meat just melts in your mouth and has a very soft texture. You can order the noodles hard if you want to help with the hangover from raging all night.  The style of the ramen is very similar to the ones I had in Fukuoka japan.  A must visit especially if you are hungover from the night before.",

I'm glad that I found more traditional ramen in Vegas--finally!  Monta is one hell of a ramen restaurant.  I believe that I'm retiring from the other ramen places in Vegas and sticking with Monta from now on.  If you haven't tried it and were looking on yelp for some assistance as to whether or not you should--YOU SHOULD.  I fall for noodles made with love, and Monta serves a bowl of it every order they fill.  If I could serenade food, I'd ask Monta's ramen and chasu to marry me.",

    "text": "Having been to Japan I can say this ramen is on par. I have been looking for a good ramen place in town and this one looks to be a keeper. The shoyu ramen rocks my world. The broth was light and the noodles cooked al dente. I got mine with extra pork, butter and corn. Slurped it right up. Since I am a bit picky, I usually end up picking out the bamboo shoots, green onions and kikurage.  Not a big fan of the gyoza, a little too many vegetables in them for a carnivore like me.  My mom really enjoyed her tonkotsu ramen. She also went with extra pork as well as nitamago and takana mustard leaf. My bf always gets the miso broth. This time he went for extra noodles in addition to usual his add-ons of pork and egg.  Both times I have been so far has been on a weekend for late lunch. The first time, we didn't wait very long but we did end up sitting at the bar. There were a fair amount of people waiting the second time but they moved fast and the wait for us was reasonable. I would really like to see how they do on a weekday for lunch since it is a hop skip and a jump away from my work.",

    "text": "Did you ever think there would be such a restaurant here in an \"all-nighter city\" that cooks and serves Ramen noodles? Yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along Spring Mountain Road or otherwise known as \"Chinatown\" in Vegas.  As you may or may not know it', \"Ramen\" noodles is one of Japanese noodles invented in 1958 by Japan's Nissin Foods. These are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your Asian or Oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend's pantry). It's one of those quick cook-it-up soups.  It's rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my Mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in Vegas. Soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! Ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!  With a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, \"Moshi, moshi!\" in Japanese, which translates to \"Hello\" or rather \"Welcome!\" (I have learned a few Japanese greetings in high school and  having been to Tokyo before, the greeting didn't sound \"foreign\"). It brought a smile to my lips, I knew I would have a good dining experience.   The restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist Japanese style decor including the bathroom's interior design was contemporary Japanese. There are table seatings and bar-like seating available. Menu is simple. Three choices of Ramen noodle soups in \"Tonkotsu Ramen\" (pork bone), \"Shoyu Ramen\" (soy paste), and \"Miso Ramen\" (bean paste). Nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. A list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 \"Other Dishes\", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.  I ordered the house specialty soup which is the \"Tonkatsu Ramen\" Soup. It's very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. Topped with green onions, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), I drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. Oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. Surely, the pork melts! Another dish I ordered was the \"Mimi Mentaiko\" which consists of Fish Cod Roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and green onions topped on a bowl of steamed Japanese rice. Very appetizing, a sure favorite! The \"Pork Belly Bowl\" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. As usual green tea on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.  Funny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! I caught a glimpse of the cook's smile.  Yes, I left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup! It must have been that I really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that I needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. For a price that's easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! \"Arigato gozaimas!\" (English translation is \"Thank you!\"), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!",

I not remotely a Ramen expert, but I know one thing for sure, it is made with Ramen noodles! All three of our noodle dishes (all different) were made with cheap store bought NON-ramen noodles. A very thin Chinese style noodle that I have purchased many times from such markets as 168 and 99-Ranch. The broth was \"okay\".   Now no matter how much you might \"love\" this place, to call it a Ramen House is insulting! Perhaps it once was much better, but with the current noodles served, it is a Japanese flavored Chinese Noodle House at best!",

Chanced upon this quaint little establishment while visiting friends in Vegas and they recommended that we should eat here because I loved noodles so much.  Definitely comparable to my favorite ramen places...5 stars as far as Vegas is concerned!  :)  I was a little skeptic at first, but walking into this tiny little place, which probably seats no more than 20 - 30 guests, was one of the pleasant little surprises of my trip.    Ordered the Gyoza and the Tonkotsu ramen with the hard boiled egg.  The gyoza...typical.  The ramen was actually quite good.  The noodles were nice and soft, and the broth was flavorful and not too much.  The yolk of the egg was pretty salty, even for my taste(and I LOVE salty), but the Chasu...MAN, I don't know exactly how they cooked it, but it was frickin good.  I ate all of my ramen and my fiancee's leftovers and was so full, but would've still eaten some more, just because I liked it so much.    I can definitely see this place getting quite busy at peak times, considering the size and all, so come outside of the meal rush hours.    Service - good.  No complaints and nothing especially out of the ordinary either.    Parking is fine, the place shares a large lot with several other establishments...",

Being in the Navy and travelled around, he said this is the most legit ramen house he's found since being in Japan. Not having left the country since I was 5, I took his word for it.  Boy, was I impressed! It's SO worth the wait for a spot in the tiny hole-in-the-wall! I'd been craving ramen and haven't had any luck finding a good place to try in the Bay Area, this really hit the spot! I got the shoyu-tonkatsu broth which was rich and savory. I love that you can add different ingredients to personalize your meal. While my brothers opted for nori, I chose mustard greens. The sour crunch of the veggies balanced well with the salty, buttery broth. It appealed to my Filipino-taste buds in just the perfect way.  I wasn't overly-stuffed with my meal - I couldn't imagine ordering a double noodle portion!!! - but I was definitely satisfied. This is one of the things I'll miss about Vegas, besides my family.",

Either find a job you like or crack a smile and be more welcoming!   But service is quick like any ramen place should be, and the broth to noodle ratio was perfect! I loved how their noodles were not in a giant ball and it was cooked the right way. You go to crappy places, you get noodles that are over cooked like  olive garden or almost stiff noodles as if ramen is meant to be al dente pasta. Monta's broth was pretty darn good too! I only wish they didn't charge ridiculous amounts for the extra topping....what could be a mind blowing cheap mean turns into a meal where I spent just as much on the toppings as the bowl of ramen itself.",

Both my sister and I preferred Ramen Sora's pork and broth over Monta. Their gyoza were decent. They did give us two extra because initially they only gave us five because the chef had dropped the sixth one on the floor so they had to only serve us five at first. If I had to pick, I would pick Ramen Sora over this place. Also, there were a lot of extra charges for toppings while at Ramen Sora they were included in the price. My sister and I also thought that the eggs at Ramen Sora were better.",

Its very small so you may have to wait a bit.  I went around 4pm on sunday and got the last 2 spots at the bar.  I was very happy with my noodles and the broth.  Also ordered some gyoza and fried rice.  Each were great.    The gyoza were cooked great.  Steamed first and then fried crispy on one side.  The fried rice was also well made.  Not oily at all and had very good spices.  The menu is not very big but it seems what is on it they do right.  I will be back again.  I just wish it was open 24x7.",

The noodles had no flavor and the broth was very salty with barely any flavor and 3 small pieces of pork. Am I missing something?? Definitely not worth the wait. I will stick with Pho",

Better bring a cold bottle of water to keep you cool not much waiting room inside. My wife suggest adding the boiled egg and two extra slices of chashu to any bowl. My favorite is the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen it's delicious with a couple of teaspoons of soy sauce, vinegar and the red powder stuff. The place is pretty clean and so is the bathroom.

    "text": "After stumbling through various Japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, I've finally found a place that specializes at it. In fact, it's pretty much all they serve. Their menu reminded me of an In-N-Out menu: You either order a tonkotsu ramen or a miso ramen. If you don't want ramen, there's fried rice and some basic Japanese apps. Not much in terms of variety. But, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.  I started off with an order of gyoza for an app. Simple stuff and what you'd expect. Nothing to write home about. Then, came the steamy bowl of tonkotsu ramen. The broth was a real winner here. A lot of places that I have tried never really got the broth quite right. This was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. Even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. Next time I drop by, I will probably give their fried rice a shot.  Monta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when I went. It started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. I wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but I could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity.",

I once went there straight from the airport after spending a month traveling in South America -- I didn't even drop my suitcase off at home first! This is not a place to linger over a meal, as they try to turn tables quite quickly, but there are plenty of other places nearby where you can get coffee and linger. Fantastic food and very consistent. Limited menu and just some beer and wine, so if you are looking for other items beside miso, some fried rice and some appetizers, I wouldn't choose Monta. However, for the best miso soup in town: Monta all the way. I am so hooked on their food that sometimes I go there twice a week. -- even if I happen to be on the other side of town. Highly recommended.",

They have four different broths (Tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu-shoyu)  I've tried three of the four, but I have to say that the tonkotsu is my favorite!  There's definitely a pork flavor, rich and soothing.  The soup is steaming when it comes out, but it makes it taste even better!  The pork they have is a little thinner than I would've preferred (due to the fragility when picking the meat up with chopsticks) but it's still so delicious.  I had my tonkotsu with the garlic mash that they have and a soft-boiled egg.  Perfect for a winter day!  The soup is great by itself, but every new topping that is added just gives more depth.  I found that the broth gets saltier the longer it sits.  =(  It kind of sucks because by the time I finish the noodles, the broth is too salty for me to drink.  Can't wait to go back!",

The first time I had this place I was blown away at how scrumdidilumpcious. I decided to go back to this place again the next day just so my friends can try it out also. Miso ramen was excellent. The pork was so tender that it melts in your mouth. Same with the egg. The only thing I would complain about is the gyoza. They tasted like the one you brought in the frozen good section at the store. Stay away from the gyoza and you would definitely give this place 5 stars.",

The noodles taste like theyre from a package and they have no unique chewiness or texture which was a disappointment. The broth for the tonkotsu shoyu was decent but the miso had an overall better flavor. More importantly though the black garlic broth was extremely salty and when asking what it was made of we were told just garlic and oil. First off, that is extremely unhealthy considering they would have to burn the garlic in the oil and use all the remains as broth base. Also for those that write reviews saying that the charsiu melts in your mouth, news flash, it's all fat! So if you enjoy MSG, fatty meat, \"meh\" noodles, and burned garlic junk in your ramen, please come here! The only reason this could be a two is its pretty fast once you're seated, and the staff are nice, but I suggest you look somewhere else for a better meal.",

Comes with basic toppings and if you want more (noodles, pork) or additions like corn and kim chee, it's an add-on.

    "text": "As an avid lover of all Asian styles of food I was excited to finally try Monta Ramen since I had heard good things. At first glance it looked like this little noodle shop was going to have a very long wait. However, we did not have to wait too long even with people waiting outside. There are not many seats, but this is not really the place to linger for long. Most people seem to leave fairly quickly once they are done. My friend and I sat at the counter and had fun watching the bustling kitchen while we waited for our ramen. The seating may feel cramped for some people, but I really liked the busy, controlled chaos feel of it.   On to the good stuff. I ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen with the regular house fixings and my friend had the Shoyu ramen with thin noodles. I was instantly impressed with my choice as soon as I tried it. The broth was slightly creamy and full of flavor, the thin noodles cooked to the perfect point so they were not mushy at all. I found the soup very flavorful, but I had to add a liberal amount of chili oil since I like my ramen spicy. The Shoyu ramen was also very tasty, the clear beef broth had just as deep a flavor as my selection. We both had a can of green tea to drink, which was a refreshing counter to my spicy soup. My only gripe was the fact that I was not completely full when I left, which is mostly my own fault. They offer the option of extra noodles, which I will surely do next time. The gyoza and fried rice are also on the list to try in the future.   Another great aspect is the price. The total bill for two bowls of ramen and two drinks was $18 and change. A great deal for any sit down place. Bottom line is that this place is a great option for a fun, cheap meal. I will definitely be going back.",

We heard from a few friends that this was one of the best noodle houses in town. We stopped in on a Monday at around 12:30 pm. It was crowded, but we were able to get seated right away since a few parties left at the same time. The restaurant is really tiny. I saw the sign on the wall that said the seating capacity was only 26 people. We sat at the bar, which was kind of cool because I got to the see the employees preparing the ramen in their kitchen.   Sadly, I was disappointed. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen. I'm not sure if we just came in on a bad day, but I thought the noodles were too hard and the broth didn't have much flavor at all. Also thought the Chasu was weird. It was easy to eat because it was sliced very thin, but I did not like that slimy ring of fat around it. My husband felt the same way about his Tonkatsu Ramen.   Service was not the best either. The employees were slow with drink refills and they seemed to be more attentive to the larger parties in the restaurant. We waited a long time for our bill after eating.  Sorry, but this place just does not live up to all the hype. I would prefer having ramen across the street at Shuseki.",

But the noodles were the perfect consistency and the pickled radish on the side was a good garnish. The meat was really tender with the noodles.   Overall, wait was a little long but it's understood with the seating capacity, ramen was very good, but the PORK BELLY made this a 5 star for me.   tl;dr: Get the Pork Belly. That's all.",

I love the minced garlic that you can mix in with the gyoza sauce!  Everything was tasty and service was awesome!  Checkin in on a clipboard near the door and the wait can be long since it's a small place and there is always a line - but get there early :-)  Price: Reasonable Food: Yums Service: Solid  Thumbs up!",

Lucky for us, we went at the perfect time because the bar area opened up just in time for the 6 of us to chow down.   I got the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with a side of Takana Mustard Leaf. Others enjoyed the other types of Ramen and the bf got the Pork Belly Bowl. Since I've been in SB for a while, I haven't had good ramen, so this was a special treat!   I must warn you though, the container of reddish spices was very salty and I personally don't recommend it unless you try your dish first and want more salty goodness. I love adding white pepper to kick it up a notch and the sesame seeds were a nice mild addition as well.  I took a bite of the pork belly bowl and it had a nice flavor. It's pretty much marinated bacon, how can you go wrong? The ramen was very tasty and I was finished before I knew it. The mustard leaf added additional flavor, but wasn't really needed.   This is a great find and a place that I'll definitely come back to.",

But we waited 2 hours to find that they had called our name 30 min after we had listed ourselves... it didn't matter, we just wanted what we came for-- ramen.  By the time we sat, our large intestine had eaten our small intestines (or so it felt) so we had to order something to tide us over while waiting for ramen, and the fried rice and pork belly bowl were absolutely delicious and did the trick.   I ordered the special black garlic tonkatsu ramen and bear had the regular. The noodles were perfect, the bowl came out immaculate. I did learn that as much as I LOVE animal fat, I am not a tonkatsu broth fan. There was too much black garlic oil in my bowl as it over-encompassed every bite, and I feel like it should have been more of a nuance... so I could barely eat half the bowl.   But I could see the quality and consistency (otherwise) in their food. Service was prompt and friendly. Wish I was closer to give it another 5 shots, I'd wait 2 hours again.",

Last week we tried another Ramen house down the street from Monta and it was nowhere near as good. We've had ramen in Japan, Hawaii and California and Monta is the closest to what you can find on the streets of Tokyo.   We started out with Kimchee and the fried rice. They were both amazing! The Kimchee had an amazing taste and the fried rice was probably the best I have had! I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen, my wife had the miso ramen and my kids shared the cold noodles. All had amazing flavor with robust noodles and tender meat. The dishes were bursting with flavor! My kids pounded the cold noodles and the fried rice.  Overall, Monta is a MUST TRY when in Las Vegas. This is going to be a regular spot for us. Oh, the place is really small... So don't expect to have a big party and get in right away. You'll wait 20-30 minutes before you get in. Enjoy!",

The cha shu melts in your mouth however I think it competes with the fattiness of the soup. Personally I prefer a more meatier cha shu but this is pretty damn good.  The gyozas were delicious I definitely recommend them.  I would probably skip the pork belly bowl though. While it is still good, I've seriously had better.    Oh and if you're really hungry $2 will get u an extra portion of ramen. Good deal.  An all around solid choice!",

He did text me to tell me that if I didn't get there before they called our name our reservation would be forfeited. No pressure but I did get nervous trying to find parking in the strip mall. I guess the wait is long because the place is tiny! For some reason the ambience reminded me of my bar hopping days in Seattle. We waited for the only table capable of seating 7 and watched in agony as the current seated party socialized, giggled, and took selfies. Ugh...hurry up guys. The prices are incredibly competitive and the servings are huge. There isn't much selection on the menu but you really shouldn't be coming here to expect anything other than ramen. The one person who did not want ramen in our group had fried rice and said it was pretty good. The ramen itself is decent. It might be a personal preference but I had to tweak mine a bit with condiments to get the broth to my liking. I don't usually have to do this when I go for ramen. The broth was also slightly a bit thicker than I prefer.  The service was quick and efficient, bathrooms available and clean. I will be back and recommend you give it a try too.",

One thing to note, the noodles they use for the tonkatsu isn't the same noodles for the other dishes.

The Tonkatsu I had tonight was delicious, and the pork they serve with it was flavorful, buttery, and fell about when you tried to pick it up, in other words, perfect.  The noodles were done perfectly, to what most would consider al dente, and held up really well to the broth.  I got a side of kim chi to go with it, and they paired really nicely.  It's a small restaurant in the back of a strip mall in Chinatown, but if you don't mind the drive and maybe missing it once or twice, I would say you need to go here at least once to try good ramen if you haven't had it before.",

My companions ordered Kimchi and I've only had Kimchi once before and did not like it; however, the Kimchi at this place was quite yummy. We also ordered the Pork Belly Bowl - also wonderful.  The only complaint I have about Monta Ramen is that it's is a small restaurant.  I think there were only 7 tables and then the space at the bar.

    "text": "This charming restaurant offering the best ramen in Vegas is located two doors down from Raku in the Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain, and could be one of the smallest restaurants in the city. Monta is actually so pea-sized that if you come during peak times you'll almost certainly have to wait before you can sit down. Don't let this be a deterrant, just keep it in mind before you go, and get there quickly before even more people find out about it.  Half of the restaurant is an open kitchen, so your dinner music consists of the clanking of woks and pans accompanied by the chatter of the waitresses, cooks, and other patrons. You can sit at the bar if you really want to be part of the action, or if none of the five tables are available. Though the vibe is nice and busy, the waitresses are sweet and won't rush you through your meal.  There are three types of ramen to choose from; Tonkatsu (rich, cloudy, almost creamy broth); Shoyu (light and delicate soy sauce based broth); and Miso (somewhere in the middle of the other consistencies and tastes like...miso). The Shoyu and Miso ramen come with chewy, thicker noodles which I much prefer in texture and taste to the thinner, less al dente noodles that come in the Tonkatsu (you can sub if you like). All three varieties of the ramen cost around $7 and also come with chasu (tender, roasted, fatty pork), scallions, kikurage (mushroom), takenoko (bamboo shoots), and scallions. You can then customize your ramen with little extras that include perfectly coddled egg, butter, more pork, and my personal favorite, Takana, or pickled mustard leaf. These don't cost a lot, so customize away. Also, be sure to add some of the fantastic accoutrement residing in your condiment tray such as pickled ginger strips and minced garlic.  You won't find much other than ramen on the menu, just a handful of appetizers and sides. Of these I've had the gyoza ($5.95), which were excellent one time but not cooked correctly another, and fried rice with takana. The fried rice is almost as good as the ramen, so if you aren't in the mood for soup get this instead. Another plus is cheap beer ($2.50 for domestic).  I can't think of any other meal I'd rather enjoy on a cold day than a steaming bowl of hearty home-made soup, so I plan on going to Monta frequently this winter. If it continues to get even busier, however, I may be taking it to go in a perfectly packed parcel. I brought ramen home for my husband once and was amazed at the care put into ensuring the soup would be just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. The noodles were wrapped in their own little pouch, waiting to be cooked until they reached our stove, and all the other ingredients were individually wrapped to keep them in their peak state. Attention to detail really separates the boys from the (ra)men.",

When I get meat at some Vietnamese or Korean places, I get scared but this was great.  When you get there, you need to sign the guest list if the place is full (which it will be).  We had four parties in front of us but they were gone within 10-15 minutes.  We sat at the counter on hardwood stools which were not very comfortable.  The tables had padded chairs.  I'll be requesting a table next time.  I would definitely recommend Monta Noodle House.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue, as this is one of those places that I keep forgetting to review even though I eat there quite often.  Monta is my favorite Ramen house in town, and is the best that I have tried.  The broth is deep, full-bodied, creamy, and very meaty.  This broth is what is missing from many Ramen places.  The noodles have very nice texture, which is what I mainly look for in the noodles.    I usually get the Tonkastu Ramen with a little extra Roasted Pork, but I like the Miso Ramen, too.  The Miso is also very good, but just different.  I would characterize the Miso as sweeter, and I usually prefer the meatier broth to the sweet broth, but that's just me.  I also love that all the Ramen's are below $7, I believe.  I think I usually pay around 6.95 for the Ramen, so it's a great deal.   I have also tried the Pork Belly Bowl, which I really like.  I always try to order pork belly wherever I see it, and Monta's did not disappoint.   I also like to get their canned, chilled Oolong Tea.  I think they have a couple other types, but I usually just get the Oolong.    If you like Ramen, you should definitely check out Monta.  But if you don't like soup, noodles, or any combination of these, I wouldn't come because most of their menu is Ramen.",

Sadly, this place was small and the good was mediocre at best  I had the chicken ramen and my friend had the pork  Both were not good....

That according to him Las Vegas isn't very reliable as far as reviews are concerned. He stated that a lot of restaurants pay to get good reviews!!   I'm not sure if that's even a thing but I can say that this is not a 5 star review kind of restaurant and definitely wasn't worth the Uber ride to get there",

Their prices are really good and reasonably priced. For the most part, their portion sizes are adequate except when it comes to the rice. The large fried rice is what a lot of us would consider a small. And their small plate of fried rice isn't enough to satisfy a person.  If I could recommend a plate on the menu, it would be the pork belly! I'm a picky eater and their pork belly left me speechless. It was amazing! It reminded me of Yoshinoya the restaurant.  As for wait times, they vary. The longest I've waited was 45 minutes. The place is very small. Nothing fancy. But they ALWAYS have a line out the door because it is just that freaking good.  Come check Monta out!  Ps, parking sucks lol",

The quality of the food was surprisingly good for the price. This is by no means the best ramen ever. But for Las Vegas I can comfortably say they are probably the best.  I would recommend wavy noodles over their thin noodles. I like both types by their thin noodles just doesn't have the proper texture. The broths are all good but lacks a slight depth. Their condiments though we're slightly lacking in quality. Fried rices are also acceptable.  Service was good. It is slightly cramped inside.

Noodles were freshly made and tasty.  Soup with lots of depth.  Certainly if this restaurant were in LA it would rank near the top of my list.    Also tried the pork belly rice which was ok.  Didn't stand out as much as the ramen.  The chasu was much better in the ramen than with the rice.  Would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting LV.  Would not all give 4 stars but given the location I was definitely impressed to find this place around here.",

    "text": "Born and raised in Japan, I've been eating ramen at more places than I can count, so I'm a big experienced fan of ramen. Stopped by here twice during the last week of 2015.   FIRST VISIT: Weekday lunch hour. 16 people ahead of me. Wait time 50 min. Had the Tonkotsu ramen ($6.95), Takana Fried Rice ($6.95), and hot green tea ($1.75). The ramen was not the best I've had, but pretty darn delicious. Good coloration and consistency of the broth, which was very savory and appetizing. I drank the whole thing! Good combination of toppings with adequate amounts. Comparable to traditional flavors found in Japan. If I had to be picky, I'd say the noodles itself were just okay. As for the Takana fried rice, it was as traditional as you can get. Reminded me of my childhood in Japan. If you've never had such flavors before, it will be a good experience. The savory flavor of the rice complemented the pickled mustard leaf which had a subtle spiciness to it. All this, including tax & tip, is a good deal for 20 bucks.  SECOND VISIT: Weekday around 9:30 pm. 8 people ahead of me. Wait time 35 min. Had the Kuro ramen ($8.95), mini Mentaiko ($2.95), kimchi side ($1.00) and hot oolong tea ($1.75). Kuro ramen has noticeable black garlic oil in the broth which is delicious. Thick rich savory taste. Again, if I had to nitpick, the noodles itself were average. The mentaiko was also very average. Straight forward and very traditional Japanese dish. No real wow factor but I enjoyed it. The marinated cod roe was spicy and complemented the dish well. Kimchi was not overbearing. It was tasty but seemed store bought. Total cost came out to be under $20 which is a great value. The hot teas served on both visits were provided in unopened cans which were heated.   Overall, this place has wonderful ramen and the monetary value is outstanding. The star of the show was the broth. Very complex flavors with depth. You won't be disappointed. As for the restaurant itself, the layout and setting was very Japanese. I will visit again the next time I visit Vegas which should be next month. If you've ever wondered what a typical ramen place in Japan is like, then this should be a good experience for you.",

A small group of us entered this small hole in the wall ramen place and crowded by the tiny doorway to be helped or at least at greeted, but nope, 10min passed and we were not even acknowledged. The waitress with a long ponytail passed by us (within a ft of us..it is a tight place) several times completely ignoring us. After the the third time, we called out to ask how long the wait would be and was once again ignored (maybe she didn't hear us? Regardless, still unprofessional and inhospitable for a hostess/waitress). The fourth time she came by, I had to physically step out a bit to get her attention. She grudgingly provided instructions - I'm sorry, are we bothering you by having you do your job? Anyway fast forward to when we got seated - she did a complete 180 with her attitude, actually smiling and acting friendly...probably as real and believable as her glue-on lashes. Food was pretty good and came quickly but the way they treat their customers really took away from it all.",

(Chashu was nice and fatty.  Sooooo good).  One thing to point out is that the soft boiled egg is not included and they use the thin noodles, which are easily overcooked.  So if it's important to you, ask for the noodles al dente.  We also got the mentaiko bowl for less than $3.  I really enjoyed it.  If we return, I want to try the spicy tonkotsu (I asked the waitress their top popular noodles and she said the original and the shoyu tonkotsu.  So we went with the latter).",

So the day we were the the AC was broken and it was hot as shit.  We both ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen.  I didn't really see if there was a spicy option but as much as I like my ramen spicy I don't think I would have gotten it with the place being an oven.    Since this style of ramen is what Hakata Shinsengumi serves I constantly found that I was comparing the two and it's almost unfair.  While the noodles were about the same the broth was only so so and after a while it started to get a little thick.  It was good but I don't think it was good enough to catch a Lyft out to again, at least not until we've been able to try the other ramen joints around Vegas.",

Tonkotsu ramen tasted just like a regular bowl of tonkotsu and nothing else too special about it. Portion for fried rice was pretty small and tasted nothing special again.  The kuro ramen was very nasty. It came lukewarm and had a weird thick starchy texture to the soup and was very oily. It's also lacking on the garlic flavor and we're pretty disappointed by it because it seemed like a customer favorite at this place.

This place is super tiny, but the turnover seemed as speedy as it could be. It was cold outside and there was no shelter from the cold. I would NEVER wait to eat at this place during the HEAT of summer!!! Impossible!!!   When we finally got seated, our orders were taken promptly. Surprised to find a little cubby to stash my stuff under the bar!!! Clever!!! I LOVED my Sapporo on tap. Sitting at the bar gave us a bird's eye view on how the food, especially the pork roasts were prepared. The logs of pork roasts were seared on something that looks like a huge George Forman grill. Oh!!!!! If you could only hear the sizzle of the hot grill & the smell the wonderful umami flavor of roast pork!!! The roasts are then placed into an oven and cooked until tender. This pork is then cut into nice generous slices to garnish the ramen or cut up into the fried rices. I take the time to mention what I witnessed because you feast not only with your palate but also with your other senses as well. I love that they roasted the pork & didn't just boil or steam them to oblivion. This is probably what makes this ramen house so yummy...the care in how the pork is prepared.   What we ordered...  Spicy Tonkotsu ramen...the most popular ramen on Yelp. Also highly recommended by those drooling to get in. I hear that corn & butter add-ons are a must!!  The broth was delicious, the ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, and the ramen was garnished with nice big round slices of roast pork. In most ramen houses, the chasu is often half fat... although there is nothing wrong with some good fat. These slices were mostly meaty. Yay!!!   Pork belly bowl...also popular on Yelp, but the pork in my bowl wasn't crispy at all. Good, but not as good as the....  Kimchee fried rice....surprisingly VERY GOOD!! I am usually skeptical to order \"Korean\" items at Japanese restaurants and vice versa, but it tasted SO GOOD!!! The big juicy pieces of pork made the rice so decadent!!! Yum!!!!  I didn't take off any stars for the wait...they can't help that they're a fabulous popular place!!! :D",

    "text": "Asian people love noodles. I am asian, therefore i love noodles.  I was saddened by our earlier trip to monta where the waitress told us the wait would be close to an hour.  My growling stomach couldn't bear to wait so we settled for someplace else, cough swish shabu shabu cough, and was very unsatisfied. So we decided to give it one more try on my last night in Vegas.  They won't seat you until your whole party is there and luckily the other two people made it just in time.  This is a cozy restaurant which just adds to the ambiance a japanese noodle house.    menu: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UPIYuRaZvknINOd1w8kqRQ?select=0iVynxXHiYaBNFOadj1eRA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/UPIY...</a>  I ordered the Tonkotsu- shoyu ramen : <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UPIYuRaZvknINOd1w8kqRQ?select=7-nI-NPnmeMYeoJBNzkSug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/UPIY...</a>  I thought the ramen was delicious.  You could tell the noodles were \"wendy's\", fresh not frozen, and the garnish were all nicely cooked.  The pork was so tender and fatty and delicious.  You could eat that all day fa sho.   We also tried the fried rice and the gyoza.  Gyoza is top notch, some of the best i've ever had and I had some Godly ones in japan..  The fried rice was pretty delicious as well.  I really liked my experience here.  The waitresses seemed to be imported straight from Japan, very hospitable and nice.  The food was excellent.  And it didn't break our wallets either.  So if you're asian or not, and you're craving ramen in Las Vegas, Monta is definitely a \"SAFE BET\".. VEGAS PUN INTENDED.",

    "text": "Food here is pretty solid.  I've had ramen in LA (which is much better back home, and I'm not trying to sound snobby, rather it's just something I can compare to), and the food here is a decent.    Tonkotsu Ramen $(7) and +$2 for egg- slightly above average-The broth is pretty good.  It comes w/ 2 pieces of meat (which is detailed on the menu).  The pork base is pretty thick, so if you are into thick broths this is the place to go.    My gripe is they don't give you complimentary egg w/ the broth, so you gotta pay $2 extra (which is pretty steep if you ask me).  I mean, who eats ramen w/o egg?  It's almost required!!!  I also would've preferred my egg to be a little more runny.  Part of the egg yoke should seep into the soup (but still retain it's shape).  The egg I got was slightly hard when I got it.  Pork belly rice ($5.50 for a large, $3.50 for small) - Average.  The pork belly is extremely sweet!  I think they use too much sauce or something. The sauce almost over-powers the taste of the meat.  I'd pass on this next time.  I was able to try my friends Takana fried rice and it's delicious.  10x better than the pork belly.  Tips: -Not good for groups.  Restaurant is small, maybe seats 20 people inside.   Parties of 4 or larger might have trouble sitting. -Egg isn't complimentary w/ the ramen, so you gotta spend $2 extra =( -No garlic press available",

I'm not going to tell you a long story on how I was disgusted while dining in to this place but I want you to see it for yourself. Before you place an order check your surroundings. Check for fruit flies around the condiments especially if you're in a corner close to the window. If you dont see anything.. check the vinegar because that's where I saw TWO dead flies floating inside. If that doesn't disgust you then you have better stomach than I am. Those things seems harmless but they can also carry diseases. If those fruit flies can travel as far as the dining table where else can they go? ..(hint) .... (toilet + kitchen + dining table + finally.. to your MOUTH.) One thing also bothers me when I mentioned it to the waitress she just looked at me and gave me a weird face. She didn't even remove the condiments. We left after serving us food.",

    "text": "My first impression of Monta Noodles is charred with the remembrance of being blatantly discriminated against. It was this past Saturday night and I actually expected to have to wait after reading the other reviews. My advice to anyone going when they're busy is to watch the list!! My party of 4 waited outside for about 40 minutes. After noticing people being seated that arrived after us we decided to go back inside the crowded little waiting area inside to look at the list. Our name was not crossed off but the 6 lines below my name were. Just then we watched as a table of 4 got up to leave and looked for the hostess to call us over. Instead she looked at a young asian man standing directly in front of me, to come over to the table. I said out loud \"Wait we are next on the list!\" It was futile as I was completely ignored. I then grabbed the list and walked over to the server/hostess that seated them and pointed out to her how we were obviously next to be seated since every name above mine was crossed out. She pulled the \"I'm going to act like I don't speak English card\" and mumbled about a mistake. She pointed to another table where the diners were paying their check and said we can sit there. Ugh! If my family wasn't so hungry after waiting for so long I would've walked out at that point. What bothered me the most is the fact that the hostess never even looked at the list before motioning for the other party to be seated. Would I have waited 2 hours to be seated had I not gone inside to inspect the situation? Now for the food...the regular fried rice was not very flavorful but had a nice meat to rice ratio. It was also on the greasy side which I like. The cod fish eggs over rice was not edible. It looked great but tasted really fishy and not fresh. I tried dousing it with chili oil and then soy sauce but nothing could quash the fishy smell. The kuro Ramen with black garlic oil was fantastic and is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. It was very salty, which I love, and had 3-4 pieces of chasu. The broth was the star of the dish. The pork wasn't bad but a little bland, while the noodles and green onions seemed fresh and tasty. My family ordered gyoza, which they warn you will take 10 minutes to cook. I didn't try any, but the kiddos liked it. After our meal it took another 20 minutes to flag down a server to get our check and another 10 to wait for the check to be picked up. I won't be back, needless to say, but will say that the food is way better than the service.",

I was teeter-tottering between Santouka in OC, but Monta has officialy taken the #1 spot by a slight edge. YES, BEST RAMEN HANDS DOWN!!!  You can't go wrong with any of the ramen broth choices. My choices are the Miso (ask for the spicy miso) or Tonkatsu (they had the spice tonkatsu as a special of the month). I like to add the egg, corn, seaweed, and if you don't mind clogging your arteries a bit more...add the butter (you won't regret it...so damn good and better!)  Other items: Pork Belly Rice bowl: Its okay, it has a lot of ginger (in which I dislike) Kimchi Fried Rice: If you got extra room or sharing, this is the rice plate you want to order!

    "text": "Look I'll keep it short.... Everyone on here raving about how good it is, and too be completely honest, it was pretty tasty. Fact is though, my wife and I have STILL only been in the US for less than 1 month.... Soooo the Japanese ramen of our home, which is Japan lol, still is heavy on our pallet.  Ok so I ENJOYED it. My wife said the soup (broth) was very good and very authentic. However, she had a problem with the noodles. She said the broth was real, the look was real, but it was kinda mind messing because the noodles were too soft for the kind she ordered. She used a bunch of Japanese words of course but I'm just giving the typical American consumer the gist. Taste is 3 stars, authenticity is 3-4 stars, seating is like wow, PACKED 24/7. Price was fine... I mean, my wife felt bad for being critical about a ramen place and her Japanese blood came out when she stared being thankful instead for even being able to have Japanese food in this American desert. Her final decision was, for a western country, this was pretty solid ramen. 3 stars!  So that's that. It's not the worst... And my American ass honestly doesn't know the one details and difference... So it's whatever.  Don't take my word for it... Thousands have reviewed this place. Do take my wife's word though... For America this is a 4 or 5 star... In reality (in Japan) this would be like a 2... Not the worst but in the homeland your ramen gotta be dope to compete. So this might sound harsh but just saying... OVERALL... It's worth it. If you can get in (always packed) please go in... If there's a long line (like out the door, which is common as this place is popular) walk catty corner to Curry Zen in same parking lot... Personally, Japanese curry is my FAV... But this is about Monta.... And Monta is a 3star ramen shop in the world... But closer to 5 stars a far as America goes. Cheap too... Good on a budget. ",

My husband has the shout Tonkatsu which was also delicious!! The ramen shop is small which feels authentic to most traditional Japanese ramen spots. The service was quick, and the waitresses were sweet and friendly! The restaurant is located in \"Chinatown\" off the strip, not an area to go walk around by any means. But worth the trip if you want some Uber delicious ramen!!",

It like melts in your mouth and just has the right perfect amount of seasoning. =D  Ramen: FYI get extra chashu. You will not be disappointed! The meat is like a fluffy cloud pillow floating on your tongue til it melts down and it is just bomb dot com  Spicy Tonkotsu - Spicy sauce. The broth was very good and flavorful. Spicy wasn't as spicy as I wanted it to be but it did give it a good flavor.  Kurobuta Ramen (black garlic oil) - Saltier I would say, it was still good. the broth was very flavorful, but I felt like it wasnt as garlicy enough, so I added some garlic and it was pretty good.   Overall: Definitely would coem back. SOo good. I want more Chashu.~!!",

Therefore, it's not a good restaurant for a big group celebration (because of the size of restaurant), but if you are looking for an authentic and delicious Ramen, cold noodle or pork belly bowl, this is the place you shouldn't miss when you visit Vegas.  My favorite is Miso Ramen and pork belly bowl. Some of my friends claimed the miso Ramen was slightly salty, but I disagree with them. The fat of pork belly bowl created this awesome aroma and chewy texture from this simple dish. No matter what I ordered that day, I can't help but always order an extra small pork belly bowl every time I visited.",

    "text": "Their pork. That chashu pork, oh my god. K first of all it's like my crack when I'm in Vegas; it's the first thing I hunt down when I get here. It's like the most amazing thing I've tasted in my entire freakin' life.  The restaurant is quite a modest noodle house, very small, and they have a simple menu. It seems this kind of place would just be something to overlook. But NO. Their ramen is the best ramen I've had.  Their broth is very rich and flavorful-- I've been to ramen houses were they put a lot of salt and MSG in the broth for its lack of flavor--not here! Very rich. Noodles were not too hard nor too soft, just right in the middle.  But, the pork. Dear god the PORK  Next time I go I will get extra chashu pork in my soup. Their pork literally just falls apart. I've had soft pork before, but that was because I'd get nothing but cuts of fat. Here, the meat is so tender and flavorful. I don't know what they do to it, but it's just downright amazing.  Each one of us got a different bowl of ramen they offered, so we pretty much ordered the whole ramen menu. Each one is delicious. Their shoyu (soy sauce broth) is the original ramen, but it is very delicious. I enjoyed mine. Everything else was delicious as well.  We got a chashu bowl, and it was a simple bowl of chashu pork with rice over it, but it was just the best thing ever. The pork is so amazing, I could go on and on about it forever.  Their kimchi rice is also quite good! Not too spicy, but it does give a kick.  You really can't get anything \"bad\" or \"ok\" here; everything on the menu is amazing.  Our group of friends were rock climbers and just got done climbing in Red Rocks for the day, so they were quite famished. We each ordered one bowl of ramen to ourselves, split a chashu pork bowl, one plate of gyoza, and one plate of kimchi fried rice, but they decided to get extra noodles. Nope, even famished rock climbers could barely finish what we got. And the price we paid for was so small for the generous helping of delicious food we got!  5 stars for Monta! Cheap prices, excellent food, and great service.",

Lets start with atmosphere, located in china town in a small shopping mall and if your dropped off by a cab good luck trying to get another one unless you call (TIP) The place is small and well its packed all the time i go at least so get here early or try an off night. The inside is exactly how it is in japan SMALL and casual so taking a date here on your first date wouldnt be ideal but you can try raku next door. Now to the good part FOOD, i love the noodles here cooked perfectly not chewy and over cooked like a lot of ramen places (note: ramen is all about the noodles so i give the noodles alone 4 stars) down to the broth which was well a little too salty not a bad broth but def overpowered the noodles and chasu so i had to deduct points. Service here is well my experience was great, server sat us fast and got our order perfect, and key point kept my WATER full which is my biggest thing at any  restaurant; why you ask because its the easiest thing to do and well most places fuck up and thats how i determine tip as well (TIP) Overall this is the ramen spot to go to in vegas so far until something else pops up but however this is still not the best well at least in vegas it is thank you Monta i will return!",

    "text": "My fiance and I craved something lighter the morning after having the Bellagio buffet the night before so we ventured out to the chinatown area and we love noodle soups so we decided to try Monta Noodle House for some ramen since it had decent Yelp reviews!  Wow what a gem!  The place was very small and there were about 6 parties waiting already less than a hour of this place opening up.  The place only seats about 35 people, but we figure the turnaround should be quick being a noodle house and we are glad we waited!  We decided to share a Tonkotsu ramen with a hard boiled egg, got a bowl of extra ramen (too bad it didn't come with extra broth though), we tried the gyoza as well, and the takana fried rice.  Excellent ramen!  Was not overly salted and had great flavor.  The gyoza was very tasty.  I think the biggest surprise came with the takana fried rice.  This was a mix of vegetables and there was definitely a spicy kick to it which was just right, not overpowering, not overseasoned.  We were very pleased with this noodle house and definitely wouldn't mind coming back here whenever we are in Vegas.  This location is cash only.  4 - Ambiance (very small, plain, hole in the wall noodle house) 7 - Service (decent service, very fast paced work) 10 - Price (cannot beat the price of a quality ramen place like this) 7 - Portions (portions were ok, smaller than ramen places we are used to) 9 - Quality (great tasting food, the takana rice was excellent)  Lunch: Sat.

Honestly I really want to stop tipping people because they don't deserve it and Why should i pay for their salary when they do only minimum amount of service for each table?

Forget that!  Considering this would be my PFGT's experience with quality ramen, I punched in best ramen on Google and Monta came up.  Typical ramen shop.  Small and yet comfortable.  Just after lunch but was still 90% full but sat almost immediately in the corner table. Perfect.  I ordered Asahi, gyoza, Tonkutsu Shoyu Ramen for me and Miso Ramen for her.  Gyoza came out first and that was decent gyoza.  Ramen came in about 10 minutes.  The smell was outrageous but that first taste before I added the 3 pepper blend was insane!  I told my PFGT, \"This is Ramen!\" Her Miso Ramen was just as good.  Needless to say, down to the last slurp of the broth, I would definitely go back!  Prices are fantastic!",

The staff from the all you can eat sushi place at the outlets even stopped by for lunch.  Great flavors from the broth and the ramen noodles were very tasty.  We hear the kimchi fried rice is a must.  Didn't want to eat too much as we had dinner at Mesa Grill.  Would definitely go back.",

    "text": "It was 105 degrees outside.   TURN THE FRICKIN' A/C UP DAMMIT!!!  My buddy and I wandered in here for our last meal in Vegas before heading home for LA. Read some positive reviews so we decided to check it out.  Service was very nice and friendly, I'd give it a 4. My miso ramen was pretty good but nothing extraordinary. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go with a 4 though. My friend had the tonkotsu and didn't really like it because it came with thin noodles (won ton noodle type) which he wasn't expecting. So just a heads up for anyone who is concerned about that sort of thing.  But the big kicker was that whoever runs the place has the temp dialed up to an abnormally warm level. We sat there the whole meal with sweat running off our foreheads and trying to fan ourselves with our shirts. Just on this issue alone I would not go back. We really couldn't finish up our food fast enough to get out of the restaurant and back into the car so we could turn on some A/C! Totally ruined the experience for us and this part gets the establishment a 2 in my book.   So YMMV but I would not go unless it's nightime... or winter.",

I grew up in Japan and the ramen here is just the same, so authentic!  Fast & friendly service!  P.S.  There's a restaurant in the same complex called \"Big Wong\" that serves ramen also.  I thought Monta had changed their name and we were about to go there.  But look a little bit harder.....it's small and the sign actually says \"Monta.\"",

I've tried the shoyu, shoyu-tonkatsu, and tonkatsu ramen and hands down I like the rich fatty tonkatsu broth the best! However, I'm not a big fan of the thin noodles that come standard with that option....because the noodles become less than al dente as I work my way down the bowl.  To fix this little issue, I have them swap out the noodles for the miso or \"curly\" noodles to ensure al dente goodness.  The charsiu (pork) slices are one of the best parts of the ramen....it only comes with two slices....so make sure you order extra if you like meat :) As for the little extra bottles of goodies on the table....I always add the chili oil, sesame seeds, togarashi (red pepper flakes), and the garlic paste.... pickled ginger is also available but too strong in flavor for my taste.  Also, for the big carb loaders out there...make sure you save some soup at the end...you can request extra noodles for less than $2.    Although the ramen is good relative to Vegas....better than Ichiza, Shuseki, Anime ramen, Yokohama kaigenro...it won't compare to the ramen places like Ipuddo in NYC.  Only negative notes are that sometimes the broth is too salty...and they want you to eat and go...so you'll have to find somewhere else to hang out after you are in a food coma...my recommendation is to venture over to Wendy's noodle and order the mango tapioca dessert with coconut milk...for a nice finish to lunch. Prices are pretty reasonable around $10 if you add some of the extras listed at the bottom of the menu.",

We tried to get in a little later the night before but, we were just too tired and hungry to wait after our long drive into town...we settled for Pho two blocks down. :)  With our luck on the following night, on our second attempt, the stars were nicely aligned for us and we walked right in and secured spots at the bar for our small party of three on a Saturday with no wait whatsoever.  Five minutes later, the crowds rolled in...   I love that the menu is so simple and straight to the point. I got the Miso Ramen, which is my favorite broth that I usually get when I try a new ramen place for good comparison. I added the sliced chasu pork that is roasted right there in the kitchen in plain view and the seasoned soft boiled egg that they use a piece of thread to slice in half; both really tasty and the pork, tender. The noodles were cooked to aldente perfection and the piping hot broth was hearty, thick, and nutty tasting.   We'll definitely come back to this ramen place on our future Vegas visits even if we have to fight the crowds!",

I don't get ramen, but I do get the pork fried rice, which is some of the best I have ever had in my life (and I have lived in the Bay and LA). It's flavorful and rich, and so amazingly priced (~$6?). I could eat it everyday. All my friends love the ramen, so they're obviously doing something right there. They also have pretty great appetizers as well.  Be aware that the sitting room is REALLY small. I think my parent's living room is about the size of the whole space. As a result, there can sometimes be a really long wait. The longest I'm ever willing to wait for cheap food is 30 minutes, and I've waited that long for Monta. But there have been times where my wait has been less than ten minuted on a Friday night. So it really depends on when you get there, and luck honestly. I will say that it is a terrible place for large parties though. It's always been such a hassle coming here with more than four people. If you want to try it out, I would recommend going with only one other person, maximum two, for your first visit. The shorter wait will make your experience much more enjoyable!",

Don't expect to come here and spend a lot of time conversations with family or friends you bring either. It's a quick in and out type of place so go in knowing that and respect the line of people waiting to be seated. It has a very simple but good menu with the classic of any good ramen shop. Ramen noodles, with different bases, toppings to add and gyoza and fried rice are a must also. Enjoy! I come here often and have been coming here since they opened.

I'm struggling giving it another star because I noticed somethings in the 20 minutes I was there to make you go hmmmm.  You heard me 20 minutes to get in, order a shoyu ramen and asahi and get out.  Can't beat that for efficiency.  Menu is straight and to the point, if you are not here for Ramen, go somewhere else.  Broths are Tonkatsu, Shoyu, and Miso.  Shoyu is the base for me (kinda like vanilla ice cream).  Soup comes standard with a few thin slices of roast pork, green onions, bamboo shoots, and some seaweed.  The noodles were decent but not homemade, very stock machine made ramen.  I like my ramen al dente, these were not.  I did add the pat of butter for $.50 which was a nice addition, but totally over priced.  Sat at the bar so had full view of kitchen and how things were prepared.  Didn't like how the cooks did not sanitize very well, bare hands on food doesn't bother me, but when you grab an egg and some  pork slices, I'd like to see you wash them hands before moving on to the next order.  Also noticed their Kim Chee was out of a bottle, which they could have done a better job at concealing if they kept it towards the back.  If you are looking for a nice spot to get your ramen on, I would totally suggest going here.  Keep your party to 4 or less otherwise it would be a stretch to find seating for everyone.",

After trying the 2 highly rated ramen in NYC and enjoying both of them (ippudo and totto ramen), I felt the ramen here was much better than the NYC ones.  My tummy was happy.  The 30-45 min wait was long but not as bad as totto ramen in NYC (1.5-2hrs).",

    "text": "The cliff notes version = this place is amazing!  I am not a ramen expert by any means but I have had it before, and for me, this place dominates.  One of my best friends is obsessed with it and I didn't understand why until now.  The only thing I have had is the shoya (soy) ramen and it was a religious experience for me and it might be a while before I try anything else.    Imagine a bowl of broth that taste like the most amazing piece of seasoned caramelized roasted pork ever, it's not thick but has that velvety satisfying stock feel that only comes from stewing all that flavor and goodness from bones for endless hours.    Now in the broth, perfectly al dente noodles that soaked up all that awesome flavor.  They are al dente, you still have to chew them but they are by no means undercooked.  Then take slow roasted pork bellies that are so tender that you could cut it with, I don't know, a piece of grass, and slice it and float in on top.  Along with that add just a few slivers of some vegetable things that are cooked so they are just barely firmer than the noodles along with a touch of scallions.  The only thing that would be more porkly satisfying would be a pork loin wrapped in bacon.  It is crazy but it somehow reminds me of one of my favorite things in the world, carnitas.  Well it hits the same spot at least.  It's perfect too because it's got enough fat so you know you are eating pork but it's still lean-ish so you don't feel like killing yourself via hara-kiri after (It's the perfect lunch).  I mean I worked out about an hour after the last time I had it, try doing that after a carnitas plate.  I love pho but this ramen flipped my noodle soup world on it's head.  I can't sleep right now I just want to go back and eat more.    P.S.  I have seen this place here before on this site and had it bookmarked but then I saw it pop up in the book \"Eating Las Vegas\" as one of the best 50 spots in vegas.",

They were nice and friendly but told me I had to boil my own noodles at home for a couple of minutes and viola.  Well I was soo tired from a long day and decided to do it the next day and left the broth in the fridge.  To my dismay,  the next day, the broth had an inch and a half of lard/fat/ paste sitiing on top.  I think this was fat and decided not to eat it.  If this coagulated thick layer of white foam, crisco thing sitting was fat then it is swimming in the broth ready for slurping pleasure while it clogs my arteries.  I just can't do it as good as their soup is and I don't want to find out.",

The noodles were perfect, thin just how I like it. The broth was just the right texture & I like how you can add your own garlic & ginger to get the right flavor/taste. The egg was medium boiled...soooo good! The pork was just okay- The peices were thin & it didn't taste very fresh, I've had better. But overall, very good bowl of ramen. I'm kind of a ramen addict so am very picky about my ramens. This one seemed very authentic & the staff in the kitchen were Japanese, which is a plus.  Also had the pork belly for an appetizer. That was very tasty, tender, & fatty!  The location is away from the strip but the ramen was reasonably priced & definitely worth the drive! I would come back again!",

    "text": "It is hard to believe that over two years ago Monta came into the land of Las Vegas and took us by storm. A small restaurant that mainly focused on ramen with decor that was similar to that in anime, UNHEARD OF. I was blinded by Monta's kool-aid. However years later now and most likely because of the raging success Monta has on the Vegas valley, ramen proprietors came from the shadows and declared Vegas ready for legitimate ramen. For me a cause and effect of the boom is that Monta has fallen in the ranks of preference and not only because of taste, but from the swarm of different styles of ramen that became available.   Sure Monta is not what it used to be pre-2012, but it is consistently now what it is. For myself it overwhelmingly salty, thin, and a lack of depth. That might not be the same for everyone, as I know that some of my friends do not particularly enjoy the thick rich broth from other providers. The chashu is more fat than anything else. Monta also consist of ridiculously long wait times, its insane to wait anything more than 15 minutes when a handful of options are only a 5 minute drive away.   Although this may seem like a bash on Monta, I think that everyone should try it at least once (when the wait is not ridiculous), sort of paying tribute to Monta because without it, we (Las Vegas) would not have all delicious alternatives.   Thanks Monta",

I came here on a whim because a friend of mine loves it.I frequent a restaurant across the way all the time, and noticed that there is ALWAYS a line outside. I like Monta because they keep it simple, the soup was hot, and flavor was on spot! I definitely will be back! Thanks Monta for changing my view on ramen! I see the hype!",

    "text": "I would have to say that Monta is the best ramen joint in Vegas that I've been to. $7-$8 for a bowl (that's pretty big in my opinion) and it's worth every penny. You can add extra toppings and or even order extra noodles if you're still hungry. They also have a variety of side dishes that you can order with your meal.   When I go to monta, I usually order a tonkatsu ramen. I like to get thick-wavy noodles instead of thin noodles as well. Ramen usually comes with two pieces of pork chashu, bamboo shoots, black mushrooms, and green onions.Their broth is flavorful and thick in a way. I swear it's pretty freaking good. The bowl usually comes pretty fast even if the place may be packed so that's a plus as well.   I also enjoy their pork belly bowl. Their rice to meat portion seems just right to me! And of course, it tastes great!  If you want to eat at Monta during the night, you have a really high chance of having to wait to be seated. Monta is pretty small and they can only seat so little at a time. If you're patient this place is worth the wait! Another thing, if you have a big party you should make sure that EVERYONE is present. If not they'll let another party go instead and wait til your party is all there.",

The Service --- The service is fine.  Took our order quickly, food came out quickly and brought our check as soon as we were done.  Exactly what you need in a tiny restaurant like that.  The Food --- We had the miso ramen, Tonkatsu ramen and pork belly bowl.  Tonkatsu ramen was definitely better than the miso.  It had more flavor.  Get the skinny noodles!  They were cooked perfectly.  Not too hard like most places.  The pork belly bowl was pretty delicious as well.  The best part was that they had this garlic sauce that you could put in your ramen.  Literally put 2 heaping spoonfuls.  Mmm mmmmmm!!!  The Prices --- The ramen was about $7 each and the pork belly bowl was $5.75.  What a steal!!  I wish there was one in LA so I could eat it more often!",

I was like, seriously is it that good?  Well, long story short.......It is.  We flew in to Vegas early afternoon, grabbed our rental, and headed straight to lunch.  We got there a little after 3:30 and was seated immediately.  The servers are all very nice and they move quickly and work very efficiently.  Per my friends recommendation, we both ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen with the Nitamago (Kind of like a marinated, perfectly cooked boiled egg) and 2 orders of Gyoza.  The food came out quickly and was piping hot.  We both took our first bites and smiled at each other across the table.  The noodles are interesting and not your typical ramen noodles.  When I first stirred the broth and noodles around, I was thinking that they may be kind of mushy, and too soft.  Nope, they still had a very nice texture to it, and the broth was full of rich deep flavor.  That marinated egg......OMG, so much flavor and cooked absolutely perfectly.  The Chasu, super tender and flavorful.  The gyoza was good, however I usually like it better when the bottom is a touch crispier.  My wife rarely brags about food like I do, but she made sure to let my friend know how good the ramen was and that we had to come back again on our next trip.  Ahh, yah I think we can do that.  Thumbs up Monta!",

Max occupancy is like 40 ppl. I had the Tonkatsu Ramen... the broth was awesome and the pork was tender and very tasty. Not too salty as others have said. Beware, the menu is very limited.. just the ramen and a couple rice bowls. I would definitely be back but at an off meal hour.... eating is no fun when people are drooling watching you eat your meal and standing over you waiting for you to finish.

    "text": "They serve a really mean bowl of ramen! The noodles are cooked to perfection, and the tonkatsu broth is fabulous, though can get salty if you just slurp the broth. I've realized I'm not a huge fan of miso broth, but my friends really, really enjoyed it. I think the best broth was the tonkatsu-shoyu, because it was a little more complex than the tonkatsu, but also a little less salty as well. The gyoza is solid, and I had some bites of my friend's pork belly rice bowl, which was tasty. It was like a bowl of mom's home-cooked braised pork. We went for lunch on a Sunday, and the wait was short. The restaurant is really small, and it was hellish hot in Vegas, so sitting by the door was very uncomfortable. The little air conditioning units had a tough time cooling the restaurant since people who were waiting for tables kept propping the door open. Because the restaurant is small, our group of 12 had to split up tables, which wasn't a big deal because we wanted to get seated ASAP to eat. It's a 15 minute cab ride from the Strip, and ridiculously cheap. A bowl of noodles is about $7, and it's huge! Most of us girls weren't able to finish the bowl. I will definitely return here to slurp on some noodles on my next trip.",

I like the tonkotsu ramen with extra pork.  The broth is great and the noodles are cooked well.  The pork slice is thin and still has some fat layers on it, which adds to the flavor.  I don't get grossed out by it because it is YUMMY!  If you have a saltier taste bud, you might try the tonkotsu/shoyu broth combination.  Personnally, I like the regular tonkotsu best, but you won't go wrong with the combination broth.  I have also tried their gyoza, which was ok and nothing special, but hey, I'm here for the ramen and pork. =)  The only issue I have about this place is the price or serving size.  The ramen bowl is $6.99.  If you have a decent appetite, you'd have to order extra noodles ($1.50) or extra pork ($2.50), which is ok.  However, if you have a bigger appetite, you might have to order gyoza or other side dishes in addition, which can increase the overall cost of your meal.  If you have tried Shinsengumi in LA, this restaurant is the most similar in taste.  I would come here again and again, but not if I am really hungry and don't want to pay for the extras.",

Located in a nondescript shopping centre (Seoul Plaza), Monta offers the best Japanese ramen Las Vegas has to offer.  Don't let the drab plaza deter you, this place will knock your socks off!  Upon entering, you will notice that seating is at a premium so arrive early because this place will fill up quickly during the lunch/dinner rush, otherwise you have to write your name on a clipboard and they will call you once seating is available.  I recommend sitting at the bar for two reasons: you get to watch the staff make the ramen in front of you and also the bar \"table\" is made of solid wood and adds to the ambiance.  I highly recommend ordering the Shoyu-Tonkotsu ramen, which is a melding of pork broth and soya based broth, thus creating a perfect balance of saltiness and savory-ness.  (is that even a real word? :p).  If there ever was such a thing as orgasm in pork form, their Chashu pork would be it.  Their Chashu pork is so tender and delicate it literally melts in your mouth.  Add in Nitamago (marinated hard boiled eggs) and you got yourself a bowl of awesome!  All of this for less than $8.00 a bowl, what's not to love?  Do yourself a favor and try this place, you will not regret it!",

I almost gave up on finding an authentic ramen place until I came to your place. It is amazing, BUT YOU GUYS NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE!!! I work off of rainbow and hacienda. This gives me plenty of time to call an order in and pick it up, unfortunately it is not enough time to dine in. I have tried so many times over the last year to place orders with you guys but again NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE. In all the times I have called maybe I made it thru once. I have been raving about your place for the last year to my co workers but can never get thru to place an order. Is there something that you can do to resolve this? maybe your phone line needs to be taken off line. That way people do not get upset when they can not place an order via the phone. Imagine all of the money that could have been made on either orders being placed or maybe someone trying to get directions to your place. I will continue to come there. If you guys would answer the phone every now and then I could bring a lot more business to you as well. thanks!",

The noodles were just right (not too soft or hard) and the broth was flavorful. We had the spicy tonkotsu ramen and small pork belly bowl.   Service - fast, we got our food really quick  Overall, this is a nice spot to try out. It was only a 7 mins drive from the strip. The price was perfect and so was the food",

I'd like to have it a little more soupy. I don't even know where to begin with the chashu. Whether it be with the ramen or the rice dish, just give it to me! They have perfected it to the point where it just melts in your mouth leaving you wanting more.",

One of the regular places that I usually like to go with friends and family is Monta Ramen on spring mountain bc the Henderson location is not good as spring mountain location! I will never go back again for many reasons.  \" I have informed the health department \"  I stoped by, got seated and ordered the usual. As I was waiting for my food. I saw one of the chefs go on a step ladder in the kitchen and start cleaning the AC vent on the ceiling with no gloves which it should've been done after hours! ,Not when the kitchen was operating! Food being made! That's a health violation! When the chef step down the step ladder he went to the sink to wash his hands but he did not use the SOAP , Just rinsed his hands slightly under the water while staring at me and went to the cooking area to put on gloves while staring at me again. That's another health violation! It gets more interesting..., As I got my food in front of me while sitting at the bar area I see a very very small baby cockroach! on the top edge of the bar where they cook. I pointed  that out to one of the server that was standing right behind me and she just looked at it and didn't take any Action so I had to take a napkin and take care of it myself! That's the third Health violation! My food was not fresh and I couldn't continue to finish it so I just paid the bill and left even though I wanted to order more. I was sick for days after that. In general the whole place is filthy and disgusting... it's very sad to see a good place go down.  As much as the owner makes a lot of money!because it's a known spot I don't think they really care about renovating the place or people's health especially the kitchen and the restroom is disgusting! Employees are rude and it's hard for them to have a smile on! There is so much more to say. I don't know why the health department has that place open.",

Waiting time though, we were there Sunday at around 6pm, they called our names after an hour. So yeah, if you are not the type who'd like to wait, this would just piss you.

I have never had creamy broth like what they have, but it will cure a hangover in five minutes flat. The noodles have just the right amount of chew. My fiance fell in love with their pork belly rice and I was lucky enough to receive the bright pink pickled ginger that he didn't want. It was the perfect accompaniment for that ultra-rich broth. And the gyozas are little pockets of steamed/crispy goodness. I just wish I hadn't been so full when I got them.   The wait can be long, but it is well worth it and your food comes quickly once you are inside. The portions and prices are deceptive and you will end up with way too much food if you aren't careful. Overall, I highly recommend this place and suggest the cab ride if you're visiting on the Strip.",

I still like the Spring Mt. location better than the Henderson location thought, because I find the broth \"less salty\" in China Town. This is my favorite place all around town, & I find an excuse not to eat, just to get a bite here.

    "text": "When I think of Ramen, I think of Instant Cup O Noodles or the Pre Packaged ones that you pay like 5 bucks for a big bulk box at Wal Mart.  Not until a friend of my wife mentioned this place that we stopped by to check it out. That's when I found out that this is not your ordinary dollar store ramen.   Their menu is pretty simple. You pick which noodle bowl you want, choose whatever you want to add to it (like a hard boiled egg for example) for an extra charge of course.  They also have other items like gyoza (pot stickers) and fried rice.  Service is above average and it should be because you can only fit so many people in this tiny place. So slow service with an excuse of \"Sorry, we are really busy today\"  will not fly with me. Memo to those that eat here: Once you're done eating, please pay and move on with your life! I have seen people finish their meal and proceed to just shoot the breeze for another 15 to 20 minutes while you have 6 to 10 people waiting for a spot.  Some random info. Make sure to sign in to your right as soon as you come in so they know who got next. Don't just stand there and expect for them to remember if you came in before somebody else. If you see lots of people outside just standing there, chances are you will be waiting for a bit before getting a table. For those that are chopstick challenged like me, they will not give you a fork unless you ask because you are already given chopsticks by default. All the condiments you need like sesame seeds, soy sauce, etc are right there on your table.  So you see their operation is simple. It's just that their space might seem constricting especially if you have claustrophobia.",

The restaurant itself is super duper small. Like 5 tables and a bar area.   Spicy Tonkotsu - $7.95 - Basicly the same thing as the tonkotsu but with a spoon full of a chili paste. I do not think that spoon full is worth the extra dollar they charge. The broth was clean and the spice was decent. Not to salty. I like the noodles. Had good bite. The chashu was over cooked, fell apart in the broth. I had to dig around for it.  Miso - $6.95 - Clean broth with good miso flavor. It was super salty. I did not like the noodles in this ramen. The texture reminded me of the dry bagged ramen.    Corn - $.50 - Plain sweet corn. I like corn in my ramen. Good price.  Seasoned Egg - $1.50 - Basicly an egg seasoned with soy sauce. The yolk was good. Not worth the price though.   BIG ISSUE. There was a hair in one of our ramens.GROSSS!!! Usually when there is a hair in your food, they replace it and do not charge you for it but they still charged us. That was a little annoying.  Overall, decent ramen mixed with bad gross luck.

So for our last meal in Vegas before heading back to LA, I wanted to come here!  We arrived at 11:40 AM on a Sunday, the place was full and there were 4 groups ahead of us. Monta opens at 11:30!! Insane. We waited about 35-40minutes before getting seated at the counter.   FOOD: Ramen was yum as I remembered! Base price is pretty cheap $6.95 but when you add the egg, it brings it up to a regular bowl of ramen.  I had the tonkotsu ramen (my fave) Really rich and good flavor with a PERFECT soft boiled egg! Chasiu was also super tender and falling apart. HUGE portions!! I didn't finish my noodles :(   VENUE: Small, as usual and single unisex bathroom. Very cute and clean and I loved watching the chefs make the food.  SERVICE: Quick!! Food came out super fast after we ordered and they were always friendly and easy to flag down.  PARKING: Plenty!",

The shop opens late and it is the perfect destination for some warm food before clubbing. While we know there are cheaper option on the menu, we paid extra for the black garlic oil. It's the best flavor to be added onto a soup of ramen in my opinion. It intensifies the rich texture of the soup and stick onto the noodle very well. It's ten minutes from the strip, and plenty of parking. No reason to skip by for visiting Vegas.",

    "text": "And my raving for the KURO RAMEN ($8.95) begins. It is hands down a genius creation! Think rich and thick tonkotsu broth with an added black garlic oil that is immaculately fragrant and savory. You know it's been simmering for hours the moment that soup touches your lips and coats your mouth like silk. I tell you, it's delicious beyond words. Give in to the urge of adding that flavored egg for an extra $1.50 and some corn for $.50 more. The option to add butter is there if you think this bowl could use more fat than it already contains. Go ahead, I won't judge. The noodles are chewy with a good bounce to it however, the next time I'm here, I'm asking if they can substitute the thin noodles to the thick wavy ones they use for the miso ramen. It's just something I prefer and definitely not a deal breaker.  I've heard good things about the PORK BELLY BOWL (sm $3.95) and I concur. It's slices of tender pork with a sweet and salty marinade over white rice, and then topped with ginger and green onions. Only, after having the KIMCHI FRIED RICE ($6.95), there was no looking back at that pork bowl. The latter won my heart and palate as soon as a heaping spoonful made it to my mouth. Oh how I wanted to come back that same weekend for more.   What's impressive too is the efficiency of the servers and kitchen. We sat, ordered, had our drinks, and before I could even say a word, our food trickled in just like that...boom, boom, boom! The long list of names on the clipboard can be a turn-off but don't be deceived, the turnover is quick as an energizer bunny.",

Small capacity and long wait times on a crowded day. The staff was friendly and are quick to get you seated. That means as soon as guests are finished and make their way towards the exit, staff is there immediately to clean up and prep the table for the next people to be seated.   Major upside to the ramen here. It's very good and still super affordable even after adding extra pieces chashu and an egg. As for my bowl of ramen? One of the best bowls I've had. Flavorful broth and the noodles were at that perfect thickness with good texture. Monta Ramen is worth a try.",

Not Coachella, EDC, or watching your ex die from furious shits in a porta potty can ever compare to the JOY you will experience from eating at Monta Ramen.   We had to take it to go because we had our pups with us. So we brought it to The Park near T-Mobile Arena where there are plenty of tables.   I had the Kuro ramen. The minute it hit my taste buds, I just bowed my head and thanked the immaculate baby Jesus for this amazing opportunity. You have to get it with an egg!! I added corn too.   Hubs had Tonkatsu and while his was good, mine was life changing.   Grabbed Kung Fu milk tea a few stores down while we waited for the to go order. It was a nice addition to our meal. Definitely will be back to both places!",

Here I ordered gyoza and takana. Yes, you may order \"toppings\" as appetizers.   3. Prepare for food. Place your chopsticks on a chopstick rest. Make a holder out of paper chopstick case.  4. Juicy gyoza goes good with beer. A tiny bit of spicy Takana does a great job as well. (Think like if you are having cheese and wine)  5. Get a small Mentaiko rice bowl (or fried rice).   6. Put the rest of Takana on mentaiko bowl. (see picture).  7. Close your eyes and feel the texture of mentaiko mixing with spicy takana in your mouth. Get a second round of beer if you wish.   8. Here you finally order ramen noodles. Ask your server to make the broth (soup) hot (temperature wise). If you are eating Tonkotsu with thin noodle, try \"katamen\" (hard noodle). That's equivalent of \"Al Dente\" for pasta.  9. Once you have your noodle in front of you, close your eyes and focus on the smell of it. Open your eyes, check the color of broth. With your spoon, pick up some soup and taste it. You may close your eyes here again.   10. Pick noodles up high so it won't be too hot. Eat it up as soon as possible. Don't worry making noise. Slurp! (Be careful of the hot soup). Eat before noodle absorbs soup and gets fat and softy.   11. Shut up and eat.  12. If it's not enough, you have always an option to get extra noodles for only $1.50  13. Put some red ginger for different taste, if you like.   14. Finish up all the soup.   15. Raise your hand and ask for check.   16. Put cash on the table and say thank you (to the servers and also the food, Mother Earth), then leave right away. Ramen joint is not a place to chat and hangout forever.  17. For some desserts? There is a Raku Sweet nearby. Also, ChaMon, specialized in the ultra authentic green tea/matcha cafe is opening soon in the same shopping center.  18. If you are over 18 and into independent movies, find this Japanese 80s movie \"Tampopo\" on Netflix. It's a trippy film on ramen noodle.",

You can never really go wrong with trying out this well established shop. The base of ramen isn't the noodles, its their soup. And Monta definitely hits the spot for that. They offer variations of noodles as well.   For first timers, this is a must try. As for the regulars such as myself, we will keep on coming!",

Our schedules made us push dinner to a late one at around 9p almost 10p. I'm addicted to ramen right now and have wanted to try this place so bad due to all the stellar reviews. We wondered if it would be less busy at this late hour and it was! We were seated right away at the counter, all tables were full. Once we ordered and were eating the whole place was full, including the whole counter top and it even looked like a few people were even waiting when we left.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with thick noodles (it comes with thin) I added Corn and an egg. It is already topped with chashu, bamboo shoots, and green onions. Sadly, they didn't have bean sprouts :( I love bean sprouts in my ramen. I thought the broth was a little saltier and thicker than I like. The chashu was SO fatty, there was barely any meat, just fat. Not good. It wasn't my favorite bowl of ramen that I've ever had like I expected it was going to be.   My boyfriend ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen, it came with thin noodles but my boyfriend asked for thick. It wasn't super spicy but it definitely had a kick to it. He added Corn and an egg, as well. His chashu was also more fatty than meaty. It was less salty with the spice in it.  The Gyoza we ordered to share were soggy. They were all stuck together like they were frozen together before cooked and served :/ the insides weren't seasoned very well, either. I have had so much better elsewhere.  I was just extremely disappointed here. The service and kitchen was pretty quick but we did have to ask for our check because we hadn't been given one after quite some time of finishing our meal. Their menu is smaller than other ramen houses and so is the restaurant. There will always be a wait because there is barely any seating and if there was a wait, it is not worth it and I'd never do it. There are other places with ramen just as good, some that are even better, with less or no wait time.",

    "text": "I didn't realize how hard it would be to find a really good Ramen restaurant after moving out of Hawaii.  However, Monta comes close to filling the void.  Monta is a small Japanese noodle house in a strip mall in china town.  If you don't like waiting to sit down, get there early as the line usually begins to form before the restaurant opens at 11:30AM.  There are a few scattered tables, but I prefer to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the dishes in the open kitchen.  Monta makes Tonkotsu ($6.95), Shoyu ($6.95) and Miso ($7.25) Ramen broths.  While all three of the broths are very good, the milky white colored Tonkotsu (stewed pork bone broth) has an especially savory meaty flavor.  My favorite is the combination Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen ($6.95) which tempers the intense meaty taste of the Tonkotsu with the salty Shoyu broth.  The thin yellow Ramen noodles have always been consistently cooked to the just right texture, neither too limp nor too firm and underdone.  The ramen comes with basic toppings (green onions, bamboo shoots, Kikurage mushrooms and two thin slices of marinated Chashu pork) however, like all good Ramen joints, they have a whole list of additional toppings you can add (for a little extra cash) to make the dish your own.  The combination of flavors and textures soaking in the hot broth goes down well on a cold day.  We also usually order the pan fried pork gyozas ($5.15 for 6) and a small Kimchi fried rice ($6.95).  The gyozas are excellent and the moist rice has a good flavor.  Each table has an array of sauces and condiments that you can add to your meal (rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame seeds, and chili pepper) as well as little jars of crushed garlic and red pickled ginger.  They also serve beer to wash it all down with.  The service is fast and the food comes out quickly.  So even if you do get stuck waiting in line, it usually moves fast.  And if you are in the mood for good Ramen, it is worth the wait.",

I also ordered the kimchee fried rice as well for $6.95.   Awesome execution for both I may say! I loved the texture of the noodle. It was soft, but it still had that firm bite that you take into it. That's how I like my ramen! It also hd a very tender slice of pork in it and a few other garnishes. I loved the Shoyu broth. I don't know what else to say! It wasn't salty or overpowering. It was just right. Not too salty, and the broth was very nice with the mixture of the meat in it. YAY BROTHINESS!  Kimchee fried rice is also of A+ quality. You can taste that nice grill taste to it. The cut o the kimchee was small and so were the small bits of egg which is how I like it too be. So YAY KIMCHEE FRIED RICE!   It's such a good price too so I felt like I got more than what I payed for. The service was awesome. The server was very cheery and upbeat and attentive which I loved. So...YAY SERVICE! Thumbs up for such personal service in such a little place. I just love how authentic Japanese restaurants like to keep things small, simple, and intimate. YAY JAPAN!",

    "text": "Oh my goodness.  I want more noodles now.  Yum.  We went on a Tuesday night at about 8;15 and there were people milling about outside, indicating a waiting list.  I had to be up early so we almost left and went elsewhere.  While we were thinking about it we put our names on the list, there were 3 other 2 tops ahead of us.  One of them had left I guess so we were sat in about 10 minutes.  I'm glad we stayed.    We were sat at the bar, with a perfect view of the noodles flinging about the kitchen.  Although I am a little short so I was standing most of the time :)  The place is small, probably no more than 24 seats, 10 of which are at the bar.  The service is quick and friendly.  The noodles come out quickly and it is fun to watch your order being made.  I got the Soy Ramen with extra scallions and extra pork.  Get the extra pork.  Each bowl comes with like 2 thin slices of pork.  It was my favorite part of the bowl, it is braised fatty pork that kind of melts in your soup and your mouth.  The flavor is wonderful and noodles are tender and slurpable (is that  a word?).    It was 20 bucks without tip and included two beers and two bowls.  It was quick and fun and tasty.  In the past I have had ramen bowls that were tasty, but they usually come with fish cakes and a few other things I don't love.  But this was pretty straight forward and no fish in any of these.  I guess it's a different type of ramen, but I like it way better.    Give this place a try, if there is a line, it goes quickly.  I will definitely go again, hopefully soon.",

What most people don't know is that you can find some of the best (and cheaper) eats off the strip when you're visiting Sin City.  There was a bit of a wait (15-20 mins) seeing that the place is pretty tiny but it was worth it.  I loved the Tonkotsu Ramen and the Fried Rice that I ordered and shared with my 1.5 year old. The pork broth was delicious and rich as one would hope for in a mom and pop style kind of place. The meat was tender enough to give to my son who loves pork. The Fried Rice wasn't overwhelmed with 100 ingredients like some places but it was so flavorful. I tried to hold back and not pig out but it's really hard when the food is so good!  I will definitely be stopping by Monta Ramen again on my next trip to Vegas!",

Also has the tonkotsu ramen and that was a very hearty filling soup.  The downfall from this place is the lack of a vegetarian option soup. This is usually a must for me. Feeling the cold disparity I opted for the chick and park broth tonkotsu ramen and gave the pork that came with my soup to my boyfriend (obviously this was a plus for him )   I neglected to notice the specials board, or rather the server neglected to tell me about it, but next time I'll be trying their Spicy Tonkotsu soup. Would have given this 4 stars, but sometimes the attitude of the servers is a bit shaky. Also, sitting at the counter near where the door opens isn't the greatest either.",

With only 4 hours of sleep and a 12nhour workday, a bowl of soup sounded like the perfect way to end my day. The spicy miso I ordered was delicious, and I ate every last drop of soup after finishing the noodles. I still will not change my stance of eating ramen as a meal, but if I have a craving for ramen I'm sure I'll come back in to Monta.",

Perhaps this is the best ramen place in Vegas, but if it is, I feel sad that people who live here haven't truly experienced good ramen.   The ramen noodles are overcooked and soggy. The broth does not taste like it has been cooked long enough with pork and chicken. If you like the type of broth that is not super thick though, this type of broth might be for you. Flavors seem to be added in after the fact rather than blended in. Something seems off about the whole ramen experience. I give it 2 stars because this place does try and has decent customer service.",

Order those first, as it takes ten minutes to prepare them.  And to top off this awesome experience was the reasonable bill.  There might be a wait, but it is worth it.  That's why people are waiting!!!",

I ordered the Kuro Ramen and it was great! I had ordered extra chashu and corn but it was too much though.  It was very filling.  The broth is tasty but the black sesame oil got cold too fast and tasted like lard.  It wasnt suppose to taste like that since I had tried kuro ramen from other japanese restaurants around the world.  We also ordered sides of chashu rice bowl for 3.65 (approx.) and small bowl of pork belly bowl.  I like the chashu rice, chasu was a little bit crispy and tasty but the pork belly bowl is too sweet for my liking.  The noodles in the ramen are just right and had good chew in it.  i do recommend the place but to be honest, I had better.",

I was worried that I would have a belly ache because it was so rich, but no, I was just fine! I didn't have any add-ins and I was so full!   My daughter had just had her wisdom teeth out a few days prior and was dying for some real food. She had the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen. By the time she was done, she looked like a whole new person. When she walked in, she was pale and tired, her eyes were glassy. By the time she was done eating her ramen, she had a rosy glow in her cheeks and she perked up 100%! It was like ambrosia.   We loved this place so much that when my friend came to visit from the San Francisco Bay Area the next day, we went again. My friend is a food snob and was leery that Monta would be anywhere near as good as her beloved Orenchi in Santa Clara (I've eaten there, it is heavenly). Monta definitely passed her high standards. I couldn't get her to admit that Monta was better, but she did agree that it was at least equal!  Very friendly and attentive staff. Small eating area, but just make sure you come before or after the normal busy times. We didn't have a wait either time when we went around 6:30pm, but worth the wait if you have to.   If you are looking for a good ramen place, this is it! If you think ramen comes in a package with a seasoning packet, go here and prepare to be schooled. SO ONO!",

The shoyu-tonkotsu broth with added corn, soft boiled egg, and nori perfectly warms my belly on those chilly Vegas nights.  With chili sesame oil, ginger, and garlic- I am in noodle soup heaven.   The bowl is just the right size for me (and I can eat), but my husband thinks it is just not enough.  Therefore, he must add 2 orders of pork slices and more noodles, and a  small order of pork belly and rice to fulfill his grumbling stomach.  Thus, what was supposed to be a cheap soup dinner because a lot pricier. It is a small restaurant with about 5 tables and seats at the counter, but the turn around is pretty quick since the menu is very simple.",

However my opinion wouldn't matter because I'm not Japanese so how would I really know if this place is legit?   I ordered the spicy tonkotsu shoyu ramen with extra egg and pork. It was alright...

The tonkotsu LITERALLY melted in my mouth and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The broth was so stinkin' rich that I surrendered after eating only half of the bowl - the girls that I went with did the same. We were all in disbelief at how good it was - really, not being dramatic, though the fact that some of us were mildly hungover might have something to do with it...  Anyway, the ONLY downside is that the place is not suitable for groups larger than 4-5, but the waitresses were still accommodating when I went with a group of 10. Monta will definitely be on my list for my next Vegas trip if I'm not up for a Vegas buffet or I'm not feeling bad enough for some pho down the street.",

The portion was very large, extra noodles for $1.50 if you like.   Ramen: broth hot and spicy, on the saltier side, the hot sauce was right on target, pork was super tender and fell apart easily with my chopstick, veggies nice and firm.   Fried rice: good size portion, plenty of veggies mixed in, nice side of ginger slice.  Prices: very reasonable, all the ramen dishes were under $10 bucks. Fried rice portion was about $7. Japanese tea for $2 beer for $3  This is a solid ramen place in Vegas. Never impressed. Will return here again in the future.",

Blissful and stuffed, the 2 mile walk back was perfect to burn off all the magnificent calories.   It is in a little strip mall and is quite crowded no matter the time of day (we were there at 2:30 and waited about 20 minutes)  You write your name down on the clipboard right inside the doorway and when a table is ready they call you.  Most people wait outside, there are a few benches to sit on.  The interior is very clean, neat, and cute.  There is a counter and a few small tables.   It is not a place you want to come to if you have a large group.   The service was very pleasant.  The waitstaff was extremely kind, patient, and attentive.    We ordered some of the regular fried rice and it was the best we have ever tasted.  It was extremely fresh, well seasoned, and downright delicious.  We also ordered the gyoza which were cooked to order and impeccable.  Onto the ramen, I ordered the Tonkotsu which is a pork based broth where the bones are cooked in the broth to create a creamy, thick, almost buttery texture.  It was extremely flavorful and very rich.  My husband got the combo Shoyu Tonkotsu which is the same pork broth mixed with a soy/chicken based broth.  This was a little less rich and was also close to perfect.  The noodles were fresh and the perfect texture.  There are tons of add ons and extra seasonings at the table so you can make the broth exactly the way you want it!   I would recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the area.  It was amazing.",

    "text": "For the longest time i've heard this place was the go to place for some ramen. Well finally decided to give it a try instead of Ramen Sora where I usually went and had one of the best bowls of Ramen in my experience. I think Ramen in Vegas in general is just super cheap compared to northern Ca, so I definitely give this place a +1 on that ($8 ramen). One of the thing that surprised me most was having the minced pork over rice at a ramen shop. That I was not expecting.   Tonkotsu Ramen was what I ordered. It did come with some good flavors, but personally I think I liked the Minced Pork over rice more than I liked the ramen. The flavors were pretty good but they seemed like a flavor i'd get at any other ramen shop. Broth was buttery but felt like it was made me more thirsty than anything. I got this other noodle that I didn't like but my friends had the original type of ramen noodle. I didn't notice that they paired different noodles to different flavors or that you can request to have them changed, so that was a fail on my part. Add an egg and some butter corn and that makes anything close to good. Add some mouth melting tender pork and you should be good to go.   Place was kinda crowded and we had 9 people so our wait was a little long. There's a nice little boba joint next door, so get some boba and wait in the AC.   Tips:  1) Get the minced pork over rice 2) Add the egg and pork  3) Enjoy",

    "text": "Before I went to Monta I expected much because the comments said it is so good, maybe that's why I feel a little disappointed. However, it is still a good ramen restaurant, just not a \"must go\".  The space is a kind of small, like 9-12 tables and a bar. And there is always a line. People sign their name and the table size needed, then wait for calling. Servers are a little busy so they may not able to hear you in time, but it can be understood and they are still enthusiastic to each customer. The place looks clean, they clean the table immediately when someone leave. I think the furnitures are not new because the couple sit near me have to put something under the table to fix it. Maybe because the restaurant has a history.  I ordered the tonkutso ramen, and the food is another reason I feel a little disappointed. It tastes good, but not surprising delicious! The soup is a little salty and the nitamago tastes weird. Noodles are okay.  Anyway, in Vegas it is still can be considered as a good one. The price is very friendly, the environment is friendly, so I think if only want to enjoy a Japanese meal, you can try it. And as a local resident, I think I will go back to try other items sometime.",

    "text": "I think besides there's just one other ramen place to compare this to in Vegas and I haven't been to the other one yet. Came here for a late lunch and waited for about 10 mins as the place is small. Not going to compare this to places in LA since I've had better. We ordered their fried rice with pork to start off and I'd have to say it's definitely one of the best I've had. Delicious and plenty of taste with this dish. I would have to order it again the next time I come.  I ordered their Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen which means \"pork bone and special shoyu base\" ramen. Bowl size and portion was just perfect but I could've easily ordered another set of ramen because I was that hungry that day but controlled myself. Soup based wise, it was kind of salty. Ramen though was perfect and the mix of chashu and egg was perfect since I usually have these at other ramen restaurants.   If you're in the mood for a good ramen place while you're in Vegas visiting, Monta Ramen is the place to check out. Though soup base can be a bit salty meaning it's probably because of too much MSG, taste wise of the noodles can't go wrong.",

Broth and noodles are nice. Only comment is there's not a lot of toppings that comes with the original order - 2 pieces of pork chashu and bamboo shoots, I think. We had to order extra topping of egg. I think next time, I'll also order extra pork chashu.   GYOZA is nice. It has a crunch that I like, but still meaty on the inside. Pretty good.   Monta and Sora are the only ramen places from Vegas featured on Ramen Festival in LA and Vegas. Rightfully so because both are awesome. (Didn't get to go to Ramen Fest though.) Contrary to other reviews here, my boyfriend and I think that Sora beats them by a tiny bit due to Sora's broth and toppings. I'd say come taste it yourself and you be the judge. It's very subjective after all. I'll probably go here if Sora is full since they're pretty close to each other.  Last note: I'll be bummed if I move back to San Diego because we don't have awesome ramen places like this. Tajima sucks! Will have to go to LA to get a good one.",

It was pretty good ramen.  Not really the best I've had though, but still good enough to be very comforting and filling.  I'll have to pay another visit to Monta Ramen again in the future  I'd love to try their rice dishes and all their other hot dishes.  I'll be looking forward to it!",

You can order a few different kinds of ramen and a few sides if you so wish, as the menu is very small and focused on the main attraction. Still, the Gyoza are exceptional and I also enjoy the pork belly bowl. Forst and foremost however is the ramen, and of those choices I believe the tonkotsu shoyu ramen and miso ramen are the best options. Tonkotsu shoyu is a perfect blend of broths and flavor with thin noodles while the miso is even more complex and comes with slightly thicker, chewier noodles. If you are not full by the end, don't discard your broth and resist drinking it all up. Just ask for more noodles and you can keep the joy going.",

Soo...we wandered into this restaurant, got seated immediately (it was already past 11:30 pm at night).  Even though it was so late already, this is one of the few ramen places that was open late at night.  My husband ordered a bowl of ramen, but I can't remember what he had. It was either Tonkotsu Ramen or Miso Ramen, although I think it's the former.   I ordered the pork belly rice bowl, and it was great! There was a good portion of marinated soy pork belly on top of a bed of rice, and I gobbled it up so quickly. It helps that I am a fan of pork belly :)  We both enjoyed our meal and wouldn't mind coming back again when we're visiting Las Vegas in the future.",

Just got off the plane, I was super hungry and ready for some yummy ramen. I got the tonkotsu ramen and one of my friend got the miso ramen. I tried her and it's very similar to mines except for one thing, she added extra butter. This make the broth super rich and I can't see myself finishing it after a few bite if that was my noodle...too much. My ramen was super salty that it makes me super dehydrated. My favorite part of soup is always the broth, and if the broth is too much for me to handle, there's no point of eating it. The pork though, on the other hand was very tender and delicious.   I'll give it another try when I go back to Vegas, just because I love ramen that much.   Ramen: around $7/bowl (not too bad). It's a pretty good size too.",

    "text": "Hey Monta, you make some good Ramen, just saying.  It took me some time to finally try this place. For one, I didn't know of its existence until after it was open for some time, and I had a hard time finding it. It is inside of a plaza where I had a hard time locating it, but you just have to make sure you make the turn into the plaza or the little street next to the plaza.  My friends that have tried Monta beforehand liked it enough where I had some expectations for this place. It didn't have to be rated G-A-F, but it had to be tasty. The first time I came, I just got a bowl of their tonkatsu ramen and I must say, I was one happy guy afterwards. The noodles were pretty good, their egg made me happy, their pork melted in my mouth, but the broth is what impressed me. The broth was probably my favorite part about the meal. Needless to say, I finished the whole bowl, soup and all! I was really happy.   The next few times I came, I started customizing and ordering different things on the menu. I added more noodles the next few times, got some of their fried rice, gyoza, added some corn to my soup, just customizing things to the point where I was happy! Their fried rice was pretty tasty. The kimchi fried rice may not be for everyone, because unless you like kimchi, you may not like it. Adding various things to your ramen makes it takes a lot better and funner to eat since it has more color and just the feeling of being able to customize your food just makes it that much better.   If you want to try some ramen and you're in the area, I highly recommend Monta. The only downside is that the restaurant is fairly small and during peak hours, you should expect a wait. People get turned away from places that have waits, but if you think about it, why do they have waits? It is small, but people keep going back because the food is delicious, it's as simple as that.",

Chicken based soup that's not too salty and not greasy. The noodles were cooked perfectly, which is always a +.  The only tiny thing they could probably improve on is to have the egg yolk more runny.   2. Fried Rice (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=EQy8G0ot2T5Vj1nQyFUtAA&userid=xRbBt5MVKZ5-_8HhhfI26g\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) - very good fried rice, yummy tasting, delicious, fatty, but not sure if it's one of the best I've ever had like other review said.

I always come to monta ramen whenever I am craving ramen, I've tried other places and this by far is my favorite. I always get the black sesame oil ramen (Kuro ramen) with thick noodles, You must try!! Times when I don't get ramen, I order the pork belly bowl, super good too! The wait to receive your food after you order is very quick, probably a 5-10 min wait. The only reason why I couldn't give this place a 5 Star is because of how small the place is which results in a long wait to get seated and how small the parking lot is.",

Its very small, maybe 3 4-top tables, 3 2-tops, and counter seats. There is always a line. This visit was on a Saturday, 2pm, and we waited for about 15 minutes for a table.  I had the miso ramen, with added egg, and a pork belly bowl. So delicious. The pork belly bowl is a new order for me and I really enjoyed the flavors. The miso ramen is good, not as salty as Ramen Sora, but still a bit salty. But its really good ramen, and will be my first choice for ramen in Vegas.  Try it, you will like it.",

The menu is very simple...pick your broth (tonkotsu, shoyu or miso) and then you are off. The food made it to the table fast, but was not impressed by the flavor nor having to pay per item to make my bowl complete.  so needles to say i would recommend you try it and put your comments up to let people know what to expect before going there. NO one in my party was floored by the flavor and the wait staff was very slow at refilling",

I ordered tonkotsu ramen, their broth is excellent, rich creamy and yummy =D Their noodle is straight skinny type, which is good match for tonkotsu broth.   I had their Gyoza, witch is homemade and delicious.   Their chashu tastes like real chashu you can get in Japan (^w^) mmmMM I would definitely go back their when i goto Vegas next time =D",

They serve ramen with a choice between 4 different broths and every bowl comes with char-su, mushroom, and green onion.. There are other options that you can add to your noodles for an additional cost too.. The broth was thick and a yellow-milky color which wasn't the best for drinking and the noodles didn't have any distinction that would make them \"the best\" ramen.. We also tried their regular fried rice and that was probably the only thing everyone enjoyed and would come back for again.. But as for the ramen I think I'll pass!",

Sad to admit but I have only had the processed packaged type of ramen until my friend turned me on to Monta Noodle House. To even mention Monta's ramen in the same sentence as Top Ramen or Cup O' Noodles is blasphemous.   I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen which I believe is their most popular dish. The broth is thick, cloudy, and jam packed with flavor. The noodles were perfectly cooked and tasted like they were made fresh onsite. There were a few slivers of pork and I added a soft boiled egg. My husband got the combination Tonkatsu and Shoya and it was just as yummy as my dish. It is interesting how many variations there are of ramen and how adding one ingredient changes the whole dish.   Monta really is a hole in the wall restaurant because it could easily be missed in the shopping center. The restaurant is tiny so it is not recommended for large groups. This is a sit down, order, slurp up, and leave type of joint. I'm not sure if I'd frequent this place in the hot summer months but it definitely hits the spot when you want some warmth in your tummy.",

It's very small, which is appropriate for a ramen shop.  Our party of three waited for about half an hour for a table on a Friday around noon, which was to be expected.  We were seated at the bar, which has a nice little shelf underneath to put your purses on.  =)  I ordered the miso ramen and added boiled egg (nitamago).  The first few bites I thought were delicious.  Then the saltiness became a little too much for me.  I couldn't eat it all, and took about half of it home in a to-go container.  I had the rest the next day, and again, it was tasty but way too salty.  And I usually love salt.  I still ate it though.  Someone else in my party ordered the kuro ramen and loved it.  I'd go back, but maybe try a different flavor.",

Also important, your whole party has to be there or you won't be seated.  And yes, yet again the tonkotsu impressed.  I love it!  And this time I ordered the extra chashu.  That meat in that delicious broth is just perfect.  Maybe one day I'll be compelled enough to order at refill for less than two bucks, but trust me when I say that one bowl is perfect and hits me in the right spot.

Creamy savory broth, perfectly cooked noodle and the tender Chashu (Pork) make it very addictive.  This is not something you can cook at home.  The pork has the perfect amount of fat makes the Ramen rich and flavorful without being greasy.  You can tell it takes a lot of time and effort to prepare the pork.  Their other side dishes (Fried Rice, Gyoza, Pork belly...) are all very delicious as well.  Service was ok and bareable as most of the small scale Asian restaurants.   The downside of the restaurant: --The broth is a bit saltier than I'd prefer. --I'd prefer more Chashu (pork) pieces per Ramen order for the price they're charging --Sometimes they run out of extra Chashu. --It's always hot in there.  They need to invest some money in AC. --I felt like I was being ripped off a little when I went there the first time because it seems a little overpriced for the portion and the ingredients.  However, now I'm totally addicted and have no choice cause it's very yummy and they don't have many competitions.",

    "text": "This place is not too hard to find and there are plenty of parking spaces with other restaurants around. If you're feeling ramen, this is (so far), the best place. Growing up in Japan, ramen has been the comfort food for me whenever I'm out and about with family, friends, or by myself. I only knew of 2 other locations here in Vegas when I used to live here and since I left and came back, this popped out of nowhere and it blew me away. Their ramen is perfect. From the texture of the noodles, the amount they serve and the flavor of the broth, it's just perfect. It's also the first time I've been to a ramen shop where you can choose exactly what type of toppings you want. I chose eggs, nori, and pork. The pork and the egg definitely is the perfect toppings I've ever tasted on ramen. The amount of fat and the flavor of the pork was magnificent. The egg was just perfect where the yolk had a creamy texture in the center and the whites had a slight salty flavor to it that just blew me away and mixed very well with the broth (I had the Tonkatsu broth). As for the restaurant itself, It's clean inside. It has a mom and pop feel so it didn't feel fully sterile like an apple store would which I don't mind. It felt very home-e. I felt like I was really in Japan, minus the radio blasting in the background. I think I heard One Direction and some other pop music play. It shouldn't bother you though if you love/hate it because trust me, the ramen will be so good you're not gonna care. Customer service was really fast. I walked in and was greeted and seated right away. I ordered and I'd say 3 or 4 minutes later, I get my bowl. Once I finished my water, (BAM!) refilled. Portions I'd say is just right. They give you enough where you don't end up wasting anything, but I'm just so used to getting gigantic bowls of ramen that I was actually bummed how perfectly proportioned it was! Is that weird? Over all, I give this place a 5 out of 5, I can't wait to eat here again (for ramen that is). I haven't tried the others stuff they offer on the menu, but if ramen is what you're looking for, then look no farther. This. Is. THE. Place.   Location: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Customer Service: 5/5 Time: 5/5 Portions: 4/5 Taste: 5/5 27/30 =90%",

    "text": "I found out about Monta ramen at a ramen festival in Torrance but the line was so dang long that I wasn't able to check out. Fast forward a few years and I'm finally able to experience their Kura Ramen at the real Las Vegas location,which is very tiny so large groups aren't recommended. The intimate restaurant reminded me of some ramen places in Japan except they didn't have the vending machine to place your ramen order here.   I really enjoyed their Kura Black Ramen. The broth was very silky and light which I prefer over the thicker broth unless it's cold as hell outside. The garlic chili oil was a very nice touch. The pork was one of the most tender pieces that I've tried in ramen. The pork broke apart so quickly. I was a bit surprised.   I also have to go with my usual pairing of ramen with Gyoza. The wrapping was very thin and the inside was very juicy. What's not to like?",

Only this time, I came with my little sister, and my boyfriend (All of us are under 18) and we wanted to take a bite of some ramen. I put my name under the waiting list, and the hostess was SUPER unprofessional and didn't even greet us or announce our party group, and we had to seat ourselves. After that, we ordered our food and they took MORE time than average. Knowing this restaurant from past visits, it does NOT take more than 5 minutes for them to prepare food. And we didn't even order a lot! We all watched older adults getting their food that were there after us, and received their food BEFORE us. From my experience with this restaurant, me and my family never had to wait 30 MINUTES TO RECEIVE FOOD. It was absolutely ridiculous. Our waiter kept coming back to us if we needed any help. Yeah, we're absolutely starving and we barely had any updates. I get that the waiters were doing their jobs, but informing us that our food is almost ready and that takes another 15 minutes, I lost it completely. The absolute worst part was the end when we finished. I was charged from my card MORE than I should have paid. They took $7 extra when I didn't authorize it. These guys are CROOKS. They took advantage of us and didn't treat us as average customers. I don't know if it's because we're under than 18? They should not back down. I'm SUPER disappointed as this place was my favorite restaurant before.",

The broth is decadent and savory and the noodles were nice and chewy. I love the textures; the crunch from bamboo and wood ear mushrooms, soft chewy noodles, and pork that melts in your mouth. There's a variety of sauces and spices to jazz it up: sesame seeds,  garlic, chili seasoning, vinegar, and soy sauce.  It's a quick Uber ride from the Strip. It's a local's favorite that is a must stop for a foodie experience. Definitely add to your list if you're ever in Vegas!",

    "text": "Looking for authentic ramen??? This is the place!!! They serve some bomb ramen that I've been looking for here in Nevada.  The location is near my favorite Korean BBQ place Hwaro so parking is limited.  I did come here on a Wednesday night at around 9pm so there was some parking. The wait for 2 was about 10 minutes.    The restaurant is really small which you know it's authentic because Japanese ramen bars are very small.  Its usually a eat and go kind of thing.  The menu is very simple.  There's a few ramen choices, add on toppings, and sides such as fried rice or gyoza.  Average price for a bowl of ramen is about $8.  I got the black garlic ramen because garlic is my favorite.  The broth is more on the rich and creamy side compared to a shoyu broth.  I switched my noodles to the thick noodles because I had thin the night before.  I also got the fried rice which would probably taste better with meat.  I had to remove the chashu because I don't eat meat.  Food wait was about 5 minutes.  I was not mad at all.  There are condiments you c ask for such as sesame seeds, vinegar, etc... I wanted to go here tonight but sadly I have no one to go with.  I recommend this place to anyone who loves ramen.  Tip: not great for big parties.",

The majority of the reviews state this is one of the best spots for ramen, but I found the ramen to be mediocre.   We got there about 15 minutes before they opened and there was already a line of about eight people waiting outside. When we got in, I realized the long wait times everyone was talking about was due to the fact that the restaurant is tiny. There is very limited seating.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen. Both were okay. It wasn't bad but it just wasn't the best ramen I've ever had, considering we have many options in LA. We also ordered the Gyoza, which was actually good. She allowed us to order it extra crispy which was nice. The price for the ramen was decent. You pay about $6.95 for the basic ramen that includes a small amount of pork chashu. You can add extra toppings, such as more pork chashu, egg, corn, nori, and kimchi for a little bit more.   Overall, the ramen was average. I'm glad we didn't have to wait long for table because it would not have been worth a long wait.",

Usually I order the extra noodles because most ramen restaurants give you very little noodle, so me and my bf paid the extra 1.50 for more noodles. Well, they give you an extra POUND of noodles just to put in your already full ramen! That's almost 2 pounds of noodles. geeze!  The taste is quite good, and the basic order gives you two pieces of pork, which are delicious.   I HIGHLY suggest going out there and giving it a shot! Great place :)",

My bf and I were super hungry and we were really pleased with the variety and prices of the items on the menu. You have the option of eating at the bar or at the table, but we opted to sit at the tables instead.  We ordered:  1) Gyoza - Yummy and delicious! Dip it in some vinegar and soy sauce and you're good to go! (5/5)  2) Pork Belly Bowl - We got a small bowl to share and OHMYGERD IT'S SO GOOD. Definitely try this. You'll have a hard time sharing it so just get a bowl for yourself haha (5/5)  3) Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen - Broth was flavorful and noodles were good too. Just be aware that basic toppings come with just mushroom, bamboo and pork chashu with green onions. If you want an egg, you'll need to pay extra. (5/5)  4) Kuro Ramen Black Garlic Oil - I love the broth! The black garlic was oh so yummy. The noodles were cooked perfectly, texture was great. What I especially like about both our ramen bowls was the quality of the chashu. It literally MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. (5/5)  Overall, we were really surprised with the amount of food we ate and what a great deal it was! Service is great too, credit cards accepted. Parking can be okay.

Definitely not as good as the ramen I had in LA but the hole in the wall look of the place had its appeal. Food was good and a nice break from high prices on the strip.   I noticed they had oolong tea so I assumed it may be Chinese owned and so I asked for a Tsingtao (one of my favorite beers) and the waitress said \"This a Japanese restaurant, no Chinese beer . \" To which I replied \"...but you have oolong tea on the menu ...\" She couldn't help but smirk and smile",

When a couple of my friends heard that I was going to Las Vegas, the first thing they told me to visit was Monta Ramen... not a club or some fancy restaurant, this place... and I see why.   The place is small simple and quaint. Went here for a late lunch (about 2:30pm) on a weekday so it wasn't busy and were promptly served. I ordered the Black Garlic Oil Ramen and not even 10 minutes later, got my food. The ramen and the pork in it had the perfect balance of richness, fattiness and saltiness and was definitely the best I've had in years.   It does get busy in the evening, especially because the place is small (I tried coming back later in the week). So I do suggest coming early. Other than that the only disappointing thing is that it's in Vegas. Definitely going to come back next time I'm in town.  Favorite: Black Garlic Oil Ramen",

I added NiTamago (2 eggs) and Seaweed... absolute perfection! The eggs were golden brown with a creamy yolk (shut up!!!), I definitely recommend this place. Worth leaving the strip for a night and you bet it's worth your dollars!",

We ordered the pork belly bowl to go along with our meal.  The pork belly bowl had a lot of flavor but the rice wasn't really great. I'm very picky with my rice so I found the rice to be a bit too hard for my liking. The spicy miso ramen was good!! It had lots of flavor and the spicy gave it a nice kick. The cha SJ was tastyy.  Even as a packed house, we got to be seated in less than 5 minutes. Got our order taken, our food out in about another 5 minutes, and were in and out of the restaurant in las than 30 minutes!! That's what I call efficient and delicious.",

You simply write your name down and wait (just like most places). Be sure to stick around so you can hear your name be called.  Upon sitting down, we were served our waters at least within 1-2min; that's always a great sign! I tried their fried rice as a small appetizer. Even their fried rice was delicious.   The prices here are very fair. Theres a variety of flavors to choose from. Miso, tonkotsu, shoyu  and even cold noodles.  You can add shredded onions, seaweed, egg, kimchi on the side and a multitude of other add ons. I ordered the tonkotsu with shredded onions, the seaweed and an egg!   The broth was creamy, milky, the right flavors blended together. It was slightly salty but just add more toppings to soak up all that flavor! The noodles itself were a fine consistency. It wasnt soggy nor was it too chewy.   The only thing missing is a bigger space! It gets quite crammed in there. Sometimes sitting two people in an area you'd typically sit one. Ill be coming back over and over again.",

I always get Tonkatsu Ramen in every Ramen places I go to. That way I can be able to compare the broth, noodles, chatsu and eggs.   I really like their tonkatsu broth and noodles. I was just a little disappointed on how my eggs turned out---it's close to being a hard boiled egg. I really like mine, soft boiled egg! Maybe, I just assume that all ramen egg is soft boiled.   But overall, it was a treat to try out Monta Noodle House. Service was great, and if you are craving for some Ramen---it will definitely it that spot!",

The ramen I had was delicious and tasty. I wish it was more spicer since I like eating spicy. The Kimchi fried rice was good and flavorful. Also the fried rice is not oily at all and well cooked. The gyoza was good and taste good when it dipped with soy sauce. The services was great and attentive. They often checked on us and refilled our water. The parking can be packed so you might have to wait for parking. This place is an option if you don't want to eat on the strip. I would come back here if I'm in the area.",

Again, we got lucky and did not have to wait a ridiculous long line . Our server lacked customer service and had no personality. I knew what I wanted so we ordered right away. I had their Spicy Tonkotsu with corn. Broth was not as thick as last time but it was not spicy at all. When I asked for hot sauce, they said they did not have any besides the chilly powder on the table and if I wanted chilly paste I would have to pay extra for it (wow). We got two sides, one was the Pork Belly bowl and Gyoza (pot stickers). Pork belly was delicious and the pot stickers were okay.   My overall experience was nothing special. I honestly like Sora better than this place. Unless I am craving the Pork belly bowl or drunk, I will not be returning.",

    "text": "Wow, I'm really sad that I have to update my review of Monta to a one star, but I think that this drastic difference is a testament to how horrible our experience was. I'm majoring in English at school right now so I hate having to write anything longer than a paragraph, but this experience was horrible enough that I'm taking my break off school to document this.   We were waited by someone named Brenda who was both incredibly rude and unhelpful - her service tainted our entire experience. I'm a huge believer in tipping, but our entire party was so disappointed with her service that many of us did not want to tip; the only reason why we did was because of Wei, another waiter.  While Monta as a ramen shop is still pretty good, there are so many other places with way better service that I don't think I'll be coming back ever again, which sucks because Monta was always my go-to spot to bring my few friends (ok I don't have a lot of friends so i guess my service won't hurt them that badly but whatever i'm still not going there ever again).   First of all, we put our name down at around 5PM, and like usual, it was incredibly busy. We didn't hear our name get called because it around 30 degrees outside, and there were no places to wait indoors so we were waiting somewhere else. Finally, when we went back to check, she said, \"Sorry, I called your name TWO times outside, and ONCE inside and you didn't come so. It's not fair to the other people who have been waiting (??? ok it's not like we weren't waiting either) so idk, let me know what you want to do.\" The \"what\" was very ambiguous as she did not inform us \"what\" our options were, so eventually I asked if our new place on the list was at the bottom of the line, in which case we would go somewhere else. She said no, that our party would follow after a few more parties because \"it wasn't fair\" (honestly I'm not sure if fair was used correctly in this interaction because i don't believe that this was in line with the \"rules\" of Monta and waiting in 30 degree weather) but I was mad hungry so we were like okay whatever and decided to just wait.   We waited around ten more minutes, and finally, she called my name and led us to the bar area. I asked her if we could wait for a table (this was a party of five, and we were so looking forward to talking to each other and catching up), and she said, \"No, it's not fair to the other people who have been waiting (again confused because it's not like we weren't waiting and it was dumb cold outside), so you will have to sit here.\" Which I mean I GUESS I could see her reasoning, but also, she should have told us that we would all be forced to sit at the bar esp because there were FIVE of us trying to have a conversation and we had been waiting an hour at that point. If she had told us that we would be forced to sit at the bar, we definitely would have gone someplace else. SO I don't think it was \"FAIR\" that she wasn't forthcoming about our seating.   And then secondly, while I was eating, one of the workers knocked over a bunch of the plates into my table and splashed me with the water and soup. And I would have been more whatever with it except for the fact that no one apologized or cleared the plates. So i ... cleared the plates ... for the workers .... who tipped and splashed me with dirty water .... That doesn't seem very FAIR either!  And then to wrap it all up, after I asked for the check (this part is important keep reading and keep this in mind) after no one was really attending to our bar area, Brenda came over and asked if we were done because \"as you can see, there are a lot of people waiting so,\" (the other part was important because yes there were a lot of people but if there were then why weren't you trying to wait on our table more instead of rushing us out of the bar area after I had to ask for the check), my friends and I all left very unhappy and annoyed.  So overall, wouldn't recommend Monta; there are so many other places you can go with a better waiting system and way better service.",

My girlfriend and I figured that that meant something, so we gave it a go.  I thought it was good. To be honest, I don't think I have the most distinguishing tongue when it comes to ramen. I've eaten at probably five or six ramen places in my life, and each one has tasted similarly good to me. Monta didn't necessarily stand out as particularly good. But it was still good.  Prices were normal. Ramens started at $7 and then a few bucks more for add ons of your choice.  Portions were a bit on the large side. Service was a bit friendlier than average.  One gripe: I really hate walking in to a place and seeing a huge \"WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE...\" sign as my welcoming. Kind of a put-off.",

Parking was a pain, had to circle a couple of times to finally find a spot. I walked in and wrote my name on the piece of paper (party of ONE!).  I saw a stool by it's lonesome at the bar top area but didn't want to intrude since there we're 15ish ppl ahead of me (but I was a party of one?!)  anywho once the server came to her senses, I was seated at the aforementioned stool and I ordered the Tokontsu ramen and added egg. It comes with two pieces of pork which was just enough with the egg.   The temp of the broth was Luke warm, the noodles were what made the dish warm:so pretty much the perfect temp for you to slurp down the bowl as fast as possible so they can get you in and out. The egg was pre-cooked or prepped because the yoke was actually cold as if they cooked it before and kept it in the chiller before adding it to the dish.  Overall the ramen was delicious. Not too rich, noodles were a good texture and the pork was tasty! From writing my name down till paying for my check it was about 30mins. Talk about a quick dinner! Don't be a butt and take up a table conversing for a long amount of time.  It's a minimum of $10 to use a credit card so bring cash if you're dining alone. My total was like $9something after tax!",

    "text": "As you've probably seen in a lot of the reviews here, Monta Ramen is located in a tiny, heavy-trafficked complex in the Chinatown area in Las Vegas. Parking is almost always a pain, and this location can probably seat a max of 25-30 people at once (hence, the looong lines). With that said, if you are looking for quality, good ramen, I think this one is worth a try.  The most recent time I went, I got the tonkotsu ramen with an egg (had to order this as extra because it's not included in the standard order), and gyoza for an appetizer to share. The pork broth is delicious! Definitely hits the spot. I do wish the bowl came with more meat. You can order extra pork so I may try that next time. The gyoza was honestly just pretty standard and nothing too memorable.  The customer service has been good every time I've gone, and they really try to be efficient and quick to get the lines moving.",

They have soy sauce, peanut oil, sesame oil at the table so you can add your own flavors. There was a line when we got there at noon but we only waited about 20mins. Staff was nice and friendly. I will definitely go back!",

    "text": "I've had a lot of ramen in Las Vegas and Monta is my go-to ramen place; hands down the best ramen I've had in town. I usually order a Tonkotsu or a Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with extra Pork Chashu (4pcs for 2.50). Occasionally I also get the regular size Pork Belly Bowl.  Their ramen broth is full of flavor and you can mix and match a variety of different toppings to your liking for a cheap price. They give you a large and filling amount of ramen in your first bowl and if you're still hungry you can order another bowl of ramen noodles (Kaedama) for $1.50 You do need to save some of your broth though because they will give you a bowl of noodles and that's it.  As much as I want to give this place 5 stars, the only thing holding me back is their service. I always feel like I am being rushed to order, eat, pay, and leave so another party can take my seat. I don't blame them because it's always packed and they have to fit everyone who has been waiting in line, but it does suck when you feel like you're being rushed to eat good food.  Overall, I love this place. I try not to come here with large parties because of the amount of time it would take to get the open tables. But this is definitely one of my favorite places for a good, affordable meal.",

I've been here a couple times and for the price I wish you got a larger portion. The tonkotsu ramen tasted more like fatty grease than a pork flavor, the server recommends the Tonkotsu-Shoyu and I understood why.  The Tonkotsu-Shoyu is better but what is a peeve of mine is that recently when I get to-go (because the place is so small and gets crowded), they get really skimpy with a good piece of chashu! I always get extra chashu and if I'm lucky I get a piece that isn't 45% jiggly fat, and they're small pieces maybe 2in diameter of thin meat. And to top it off sometimes it's not even a discernible piece but a broken up tiny lump of fat-meat that's supposed to be the last remaining 3 out  of 6 pieces... which surely didn't look like 3 pieces.  Overall I think it's overrated and a little overpriced for the amount of soup/noodles and meat given along with a very \"fat\" tasting meal but hey that's flavor I suppose. I might come back every once in a while unless I find someplace better although it would be further away.",

Instead, order the extra cha siu for your bowl.  This was the best tasting cha siu I have ever had at a ramen place.  It was moist and had some fatty goodness in it.  Yum!",

I think miso usually is the strongest flavor unless you have some serious broth.  But their broth is a bit lighter.  Combined with Shoyu it was just saltly I guess.  Not very complex flavors.  The gyo za is average.  Doubt they make it themselves.  Probably try the miso instead of the tonkotsu shoyu if I ever come again.  Not a bad place, especially considering vegas, but overall not the best.",

I got the Tonkatsu ramen, the broth was so flavorful, wasn't greasy and it tasted just right, I got an extra order of Chashu pork and ordered the ramen as is. The serving size was plenty! we also ordered gyoza, at Monta you're able to mix all the necessary ingredients for the gyoza dipping sauce and make it spicier if you want. Anyways, my overall experience was great, and I will definitely come back when I'm in Vegas.",

Plus we got our food pretty quick. Considering this was officially our first real meal from our 4-5 hour trip this was a huuuuuuuge plus!  \"The Food\"- I ordered the Tonkatus Shoyu Ramen...with extra chashu and extra flavored egg. It was definitely flavorful the broth was amazing and the noodles were soft and easy to gobble up !!!!! I was very tempted to order some more noodles but amazingly I got full pretty quick! I 've had pretty good ramen all over from Torrance to Honolulu and I must say this ranks up there....Maybe because Vegas is considered the 9th island...the local Japanese Hawaiians get it right everytime.   If you're from the South Bay like I am its pretty comparable to Yamadaya and Hakata...but overall still is another one of those I would come back to Vegas to make this a first pit stop for some bomb ass Ramen yo!",

Being that Monta is probably the best ramen place in town I decided to add a star.  Anyways, came back over the weekend for a second try and ordered the Miso ramen with extra pork. It was mm mm good and the extra pork definitely hit the g-spot.  I did regret not adding the egg and corn, im sure it would've made it perfect.  Still pretty hot inside even with the AC fixed but i guess it's tolerable after the use of 10 napkins to wipe off my sweat.",

It comes with 2 small slices of fatty pork and green onions .  Don't come here if you don't eat pork. My bowl of noodles came out in about 3 minutes. In fact I was in and out of there in less than 30 minutes. I had a great experience  here but I doubt I would wait more than thirty  minutes to eat here since it's surrounded by other good restaurants . Next time I want to try the fried rice, gyoza, and maybe the Spicy ramen. Thank you YELPERS for the great recommendation !",

The portions are generous, and for $20 total, we could not have been more satisfied with the food or the service. They do a brisk business here. I will definitely be back! This was heaven in a bowl.

Most ramen places are pretty small but because their food is awesome, they shouldn't shy away from expanding because the food itself sells. The staff is very quick and efficient, they try to get people in as fast as they can and they are pretty quick with the needs of the customers! We ordered the pork belly bowl, shoyu ramen, Gyoza, fried rice and kimchee. Everything we had was tasty and the pricing is definitely reasonable!!! Will be coming here again.. Hopefully it won't be as busy and hopefully they can expand the restaurant size in the future.. But count on us as future regulars!",

I wish the noodles was a bit thicker. The thin strand is not really my favorite. Chashu was sliced to a perfect medium thickness.

Last night, a friend and I got things rolling with Asahi and an order of crispy-edged gyoza. The Asahi, by the way, is on tap. That's rare.  When the tonkatsu ramen arrived, I was afraid to dig in...at first, it just looked so pretty. The broth was cloudy and delicately shaded. Two large slices of tender pork lay atop a pile of ramen noodles. I got mine with a hardboiled egg - the two halves smiled up at me.  I really love ramen. It's a bowl of super happy. This is the best I've had in town. I have no idea what the spicy stuff in the shaker was (it was explained to me once, but that was between Asahis one and two), but a sprinkling of that and sesame seeds added punch and richness. When you eat this stuff, make sure to savor it. There's a lot of flavor going on in there.  So yeah. Pretty darn fantastic. I could imagine myself coming back, again and again...and I know what I'll pick up the next time I get the sniffles.",

Not only that, it was packed at 4pm!!! Yeah the hungover Asians woke up effin late for \"lunch\".  We obviously had to wait since we rolled 9 deep up... We waited around for maybe 20 minutes inside since it was way too cold to wait outside.  We were finally seated and served by the nicest waitress ever.  This chick smiled every moment that I remember at Monta.  Very nice and curtious.  We ordered the following dishes:  Miso Ramen with Chasu:  If you order this Ramen, I warn you... DO NOT ADD BUTTER!  This thing is mad heavy.  I felt I was drinking mashed potatoes at one point.  The flavor was amazing but it came out warm and not hot enough for the weather.  I wish my bowl was just a bit warmer and less heavy.  Other than this the soup was really good.  The chasu pork just melted in my mouth. mmmm  Dumplings:  Perfectly fried.  Now I've tried dumplings for many years and this place had one of the best!  Dumplings are supposed to have that golden roast fried look.  Monta's dumplings all had this color.  Once your dumpling has dark brown or black then that mo'fo is burned out and will be waaay to crispy.  If your dumpling doesn't have that golden roast then it probably is just semi fried which is too bland and soggy.    Pork Belly Rice:  This was pretty good too.  Very tender and well marinated meat and enough ginger for a unique taste.  Most people in my party chose this as their favorite.   Ton Katsu Ramen:  My friends ordered this Ramen which was pretty good in my opinion.  The description on the menu made it seem very rich in fat and unhealthy but it actually turned out to be less heavy than the Miso I ate.  Good to know where to get my Ramen fix in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "(Update: this place is always jam packed with people now. It has earn the reputation of being the best place in town for ramen).  Due to all of your rave reviews I was compelled to give this place a try.  (I can just hear my dad saying, \"if everyone jumped off a cliff would you jump too?  If it were into a yummy ocean of noodle soup, hell yeah!)  This little gem is hidden a bit back from the road and does not have a huge eye catching front.  It modestly blends in with the rest of the shops.  As you enter you will be greeted by the cooks, servers, and maybe a few customers.  It is a simple small noodle shop fighting the Vegas Heat with a weak AC system and a multitude of fans.  Was it warm?  Yes sir, very much so.  But my good friend told me, that regardless of the heat we should endure and it would be worth it.  We sat at the rotating wooden stools at a lovely solid one piece of wood bar.  Service was immediate and friendly.  I found the very short menu to be a relief from the pages and pages of food offerings of other establishments.  I often have trouble deciding what to eat, and then leave with regrets if I did not enjoy my meal.  Neither would be the case today.  I have heard a hero of mine speak of restaurants that only make one thing, but they make it better than anyone else around.  I hoped for a similar experience.  I quickly decided on the Tonkotsu Ramen with tamago, chashu, mustard cabbage, and green onions.  I noticed from everyone's pictures that many of us decided on the exact same combination.  Great minds think alike right?    A few minutes later a large hot bowl of aroma and color found its way to me.  I dug in and didn't stop till the bowl was tilting to my face and the last drops of soup were tickling my tongue.  I love the thinner noodles over udon, so I am a bit biased here.  The noodles where not over cooked for my taste and the broth had great flavor.  The Chashu I got was soft and delicious.  Everything just seemed to go together perfectly.  If I were judging this restaurant against all noodle places in vegas, 5 stars.  But since I have had some outstanding noodles in California that I set my standards by, I'll give this 4.  Don't get me wrong, this place is great, and I will be back, but I am saving the 5 star rating for a place I love in California.  I just need to eat there a few more times and make sure that it wasn't just the one time.",

Got here about 8pm, luckily my cousin snagged a table since the place filled up fast. The menu here is pretty simple, ramen, sides, rice dishes and thats about it. I had the Tonkatsu with the premium green onions and the four of us split orders of Gyoza, Kim Che fried rice, large order of Pork Belly over rice and the Fish Eggs over rice (the name escapes me). Everything was very delicious. About the best I've had in a while including places on Sawtelle Blvd in West LA, known for its large Japanese population.   Pros: Ramen was a nice al-dente with good chew, broth was very savory it definitely had that umami kick to it. Service was quick. Cons: The Gyoza skin was a little too burned on bottom and under cooked on top. Limited seating could be a future PITA.",

    "text": "This location is very small and sometimes too crowded, but it hits the spot every time. If you're looking for a quick pick me up meal, Monta is the place to go. Their menu is small but very straightforward. It's sometimes nice to not be overwhelmed by a huge variety of things on a menu. They have different ramen bases and sides that you can add to your ramen. The ramen is very delicious and filled with lots of flavor. If you aren't craving ramen, they also have delicious rice dishes and other nonsoup based dishes. This place also does not break the bank. Cheap eats that are actually very yummy is always the way to go. As for the service, I feel like it depends on the day. If it isn't too busy, it's very fast, and obviously if it is busy, you may have to wait a bit longer. This place is definitely a casual dining environment, with yummy Japanese comfort food! Overall this hole in the wall joint is worth it, especially for a college student on a budget such as myself. Monta definitely has me coming back for more.",

There is probably only room for maybe 40-50 people at max.    They do Ramen, fried rice, gyoza, draft beer (Asahi), and canned tea.  Tried the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen, added egg, shredded green onion and a dash of shichimi it was a hardy and satisfying meal and good.  All in, this bowl of ramen was only$10 and maybe less.  I Best Ramen I ever tasted, no- respectable and tasty, yes!  When you factor in the price this place probably deserves 4.5 stars, when you factor in the fact that we are in Vegas, and a small restaurant in an inconspicuous stripmall is thriving- they deserve 5-stars. I'm taking a star away for only offering canned tea.    I mean even if you don't want to do a pots of tea, a cup, microwaved hot water and a bag isn't hard or expensive, fail.    I gladly would have shelled out $2-3 for a cup of fresh hojicha, that probably had about a cost o f.14",

Usually they taste just like the 25-cent packs of ramen that you get from supermarkets. This noodle bar is just like that. I loved the broth and the cha-siu (marinated and slow-cooked pork meat), but I couldn't stand the noodles. I would still recommend it, but only if you don't have to wait in line for too long.",

    "text": "This tiny little ramen place was everything it was cracked up to be.  My parents live locally and they'd heard from several sources about how great this place was, so when we were visiting, we took them out to Monta.  We managed to get there at the perfect time because only 1 table was occupied, so getting my dad in was quick and easy (he is in a wheelchair).  They don't have hot drinks, so enjoy some UCC Oolong or Green Tea or a can of Calpico (I wish they had UCC Iced Coffee!!)  We placed our order and watched as the crowd built up very quickly.  Food arrived fast and piping hot.  The gyoza was fine - crunchy on one side, steamed on the other, hot all the way through.  My mom and hubs got the pork belly bowls and my dad and I got the miso ramen (I got mine with corn)  The charsiu/chashu/chasyu (how ever you want to spell it) WAS SO AMAZING - I do not use this phrase lightly.  It was LITERALLY melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The pork fat was flavorful and rich and just melted away when it hit your tongue.  So amazing!  I am sad that I didn't stop and order a side of it immediately.  The ramen noodles had a great chewy texture and the miso broth was delicious.  My mom was very pleased with the pork belly bowl, as well.  The only thing that didn't live up to everything else was the mentaiko bowl.  I got it because I love hot rice and tarako (and my mom had made some for me the night before and I was still jonesing for it).  Unfortunately, the rice was not very hot and a little on the dry side, so the bowl was disappointing.  I ladeled some of the miso broth into the bowl and that made the rice more palatable, but it messed with the flavor of the mentaiko.  All in all, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go to Vegas again so I can go to Monta again!   **ACCESSIBILITY NOTE - The parking lot is not very wheelchair friendly and Monta itself can be a little tight to try to get a wheelchair in and out.  The only wheelchair ramp up from the parking lot is blocked by the car when you park in the handicapped space, so once you get the person into their chair, you have to move the car to get them up to the sidewalk level where the restaurants are.",

    "text": "We love us some good ramen and Monta Ramen was that!  A couple of weeks ago we spent the weekend out in Vegas and this was our top destination :)  We ordered the tradition tonkotsu ramen ($6.95) as well as the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen ($6.95).  Both were good but the tradition tonkotsu was what really caught our attention. The broth was really good. Smooth, creamy and a tad salty.    The noodles were perfectly cooked and tasted great.  The meat was also above average. Tender with a good amount of fat.    We also added an egg to our bowls and we were so glad we did. It was cooked correctly with the right amount of creaminess to it.  It's the best ramen we've had since our trip back from japan.  In addition to the ramen bowls, we ordered a mini pork belly bowl which was good enough to steal our attention from the ramen. The pork belly was thinly cut, which makes it a lot easier to eat with the rice. It's a great side to order if you visit.  As for the staff they were friendly, maybe a little bit overwhelmed. The cook didn't look happy at all for some reason but he was still churning out some great food so we can't complain!  Overall we would recommend trying this place out. Even in 110 degree weather, it's was oishii! (delicious in japanese)",

This place is very small, and sometimes the wait can be a while, but the service is actually really quick. I've tried every flavor, but my favorite would have to be the Tonkatsu with corn. The corn just puts it over the top! My boyfriend is usually a die hard Miso fan, it's pretty good, I don't love it, but so far he likes Monta's the best.   I don't ever order fried rice at restaurants, but this one time I did and it was actually pretty good! It had a lot of flavor, it reminded me of my mom's. The pork belly bowl is delicious too, but I wouldn't go there for that. Overall, Monta would have to be my favorite ramen spot!",

The broth is rich and creamy, and has a great savory flavor. The noodles are soft and chewy - exactly what I was hoping for! It makes me think of comfort food, that's how yummy this dish is.   You can order extra noodles to finish your broth up with but I couldn't bring myself to do it this time. The broth and all the fixings are really filling!   Go here, get some ramen, and learn what this dish is really all about. Although, dorm room ramen will always have a special place in my heart.",

I got the extra chashu which was great and pretty different than other chashu I've had as it had more of a roasted taste.  The gyoza was just ok.  My wife (Japanese) was disappointed w/ the quality of the noodles but we'll take what we can get outside of Japan.    This certainly beats the hell out of the prices of Yokohama Kaigenro and I am psyched its so close to my place.    I'm more of a shoyu ramen guy which is what I'll get next time.",

I repeat, I REALLY like their ramen.  But man, everything else is annoying.   I came here with a group of 5 once (all newcomers so I was trying to show off the place).  Luckily, we showed up right when they opened so we got seated right away.  We were all squished on a table that clearly should have supported only 4 full grown adults.  But the ramen is so tender, the broth so hearty and flavorful, and the boiled egg and yolk so delicious.  On another occasion, I came here for dinner with 1 other person and ended up waiting about 1.5 hours because the place is so darn busy and there aren't enough seats.  I kid you not.  Several times we thought about leaving but couldn't come up with an alternative ramen joint that was remotely as good.  It's absolute cruelty.  Also, they don't seat you unless your entire party is there.  And I wouldn't recommend going with a party bigger than 4 or it's almost impossible to find somewhere to sit.  While their ramen is super delicious, they really need to move to a bigger location and give their staff some customer service classes.",

    "text": "Every bowl of ramen comes with two slices of pork chashu, green onions, kikurage (black mushroom), and bamboo shoots. There are four different types of broths:  1. Shoyu- Soy sauce-based broth, pretty salty and nothing spectacular, average  2. Miso- miso-based broth, salty but not overwhelmingly so, pretty run-of-the-mill miso ramen  3. Tonkotsu- pork flavored broth, savory, and has a creamy texture. The soup's thick consistency is due to boiling pork bones, collagen, and fat for a long period of time. Some people find the thickness of the savory broth distasteful and unsettling. If you're not a fan of a thick soup, I would skip this one. Definitely one of my favorite broths to get here.  4. Tonkotsu-Shoyu- best of both worlds, the tonkotsu and shoyu work well to balance each other out. The shoyu waters down the tonkotsu so it's not as thick and the tonkotsu adds a bold, fuller flavor to the shoyu. This is definitely Monta's signature ramen and a must try.  Additional Toppings: Some of the toppings are noticeably more expensive compared to other local ramen joints that already include these toppings in their ramen.  Additional Notes:  *If you order extra noodles (Kaedama), it comes in a separate bowl usually in the middle of the meal. It's been heated up so your noodles are still delicious even if your broth is not as hot as in the beginning.  * There are two types of noodles to choose from: thick cup ramen style noodles (that definitely taste nothing like those horrible cup noodles) or a thinner noodle similar to Chinese egg noodles (not the noodle that usually comes with wonton noodle soup). I definitely prefer the thicker noodles; the thinner ones tend to be overcooked easily and soggy.  *There is a $10 minimum on credit cards. Bring cash if you don't plan to spend more than that. *They will not sit you at a table unless your whole party is present.  Overall:  So far, Monta has the best ramen in Vegas. (Still need to try Anime Ramen, and Fukumimi though.) It's just the thing that hits the spot on a cold chilly night when you need some warming up.   Service varies depending on how busy they are. Bar seating may get uncomfortable for some but that's how traditional ramen houses are: small and cramped. Seating is very limited so anticipate a wait if you're coming during peak hours.   The consistency of the ramen sometimes varies as well. Sometimes the chashu is over done, resulting in a dry piece of meat that doesn't have that heavenly gelatinous soft layer of fat that melts in your mouth. Also, the noodles sometimes come out too soft if they've been sitting there for a while. Once in a while, the yolk of the hard boiled egg will be completely solid, with none of that ooey gooey goodness. These hiccups happen rarely, only when they're extremely busy and it's during peak hours. Portions are decent sized for a regular person. If you're a gluttonous fatty like me, it's better to share fried rice (which is quite delicious) with a buddy.  Overall, despite the ridiculous wait sometimes and food consistency issues, Monta is definitely a must try for locals and tourists.",

Really can't get over the fact that the broth is so dark and salty every time I eat here.  I really don't get that soulful feeling that I get when eating really great ramen.  I would rate it as decent, but needs vast improvement.  I know we are all about the money, but improve what you do before you open another location.    BTW this is not Hakata style Ramen.  I have had ramen all over Hakata and Tenjin.  Monta's is a version of tonkontsu style that comes from Fukuoka.",

The order consisted of: Gyoza Fried Rice Tonkotsu Ramen Chashu Bowl  I found myself anticipating each round of Umami goodness because each dish was devoured so quickly.  Those gyoza were nice and crispy and tasted great.  The definite star was the pork.  I found myself assuring I got a piece in every bit of the Fried Rice.  The Chashu in the Ramen was a perfect combination and that Chashu Bowl was just pure pork indulgence.  We even ordered some Fried Rice and extra Chashu to go because I was sure to be craving that pork later in the night, and sure enough I did.  I'm craving  This place is an easy choice.  It's a small menu but everything is done so well.  Great prices for the quaity of food you get.  You can't go wrong with anything here IMO.",

Both packed with amazing flavor. We went around 2pm so although there was a tiny wait, it was nowhere near 20 minutes. The waitress was very nice and quick. We are definitely making this a tradition whenever we go to Vegas!",

Therefore, it wasen't as ungodly hot and stifling inside as it was last time.  I ate the whole bowl of ramen AGAIN. I have begun to really grasp just WHAT makes the tonkotsu ramen so good. It's savory and not overly salty. In fact, it's UN-ramen-like in that regard. (OK, i'll admit to normally eating a shoyu-based one many many times) The broth is actually a bit creamy (VERY addictive) and the stuff inside the bowl is tops.  Can I tell you how much IN LOVE with the marinated boiled/almost soft egg in it, AKA nitamago? It's so damn great! If you like hardboiled or softboiled egg, you'll love it I guarantee.  I have to try the fried rice and their gyoza. They smell very very good, but I have to have more people with me to get it all eaten! When the weather cools down, i'm going to be here LOTS!  BTW, they have a VERY funky restroom!",

It is tender and flavorful. - Their gyoza is pan fried, but I prefer deep fried. - The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's too small & claustrophobic. - There's almost always a wait for a table unless you go during off-peak hours. - Once you get seated, the service is pretty good. - I thought it was a little strange that when I ordered ramen to go, I was told that the noodles were not cooked & that I had to boil them myself. This sucked because the whole reason I order take out is because I don't feel like cooking or don't have time to cook. So having to boil the noodles myself kinda defeats the purpose.",

You can't find tonkotsu ramen like this in Hawaii.  It reminded me of Japan.  In fact Monta surpassed some ramen that I've had in Japan (and I've had my share of ramen).    The soup is perfect.  Milky pork bone flavor without being too salty or too fatty.  The noodles are tasty and cooked to perfection.  Kaedama (Noodle refill) available too.  The chashuu is the best I've had anywhere.  Blew away Menya Kissou in Tokyo, my previous fav.  Melts in your mouth.  The nita tamago wasn't that good.  Passed on it the second time.  Still cold when served which didn't go well with a hot bowl of noodles.  Hence the 4 stars.  Spent 2 of my 5 lunches here while in Vegas.",

This movie is amazing and it's about foodie ramen culture in Japan.  They are as authentic as it comes.  Just like the movie, the ramen is cooked al dente, the pork slices are placed carefully, the soup is hot and the broth is flavorful.  All the toppings are there and we were so excited we replicated a part of Tanpopo when the zen ramen master mindfully eats his ramen.    I knew this place was it when I ate everything and drank the broth to the bottom of the bowl.  The soft boiled eggs are a must.  This place is amazing and the menu is simple and they just added the shoyu ramen which is by far my favorite.  the shoyu ramen is light broth not overly salty, the tonkatsu is very meaty and flavorful and they use a different noodle.  I prefer the ramen noodles that come with the miso ramen though.  The miso ramen is delicious but, a little to salty (but, authentic for japanese taste)  I wouldn't get their gyoza again.  pretty generic and expensive.  the ramen is cheap coming in at under $7 for the tonkatsu and $8 for the miso.  This place is damn good.  I went their for dinner and was so impressed I went back for lunch again the next day driving all the way from Henderson.    Monta is pretty authentic looking and I hope it does well because I love little hole in the wall gems.",

Their fried rice is good as well I believe they have bits of pork belly in their rice, which gives it an extra kick I believe.   If you just enjoy pork belly they have it on top of rice which is suberp.    It's pretty inexpensive as well about $7.00 for a bowl of Ramen, not too bad.  Of course if you want to add extra things in there it adds to it.   Beware though if you come in the morning it tends to be very crowded.

Also tried the pork belly bowl not bad.. but really really thin pork belly and not much of it to start with.... great with kimchi!  ps.. remember all \"extras\" come with a price tag so asking for extra kimchi or green onion they will charge you and not tell you that you are being charged to them its universally understood that there's no free lunch with this world.. or well.. free.. anything..

The place  is reminiscent to the noodle houses we frequent in Torrance, CA and Litte Tokyo, offering a simple menu that doesn't detract patrons from the restaurant's main dish: ramens. We opted to try the miso ramen (bean paste) and tonkotsu ramen (pork bone) with the addition of available toppings such as chasu (roasted pork -- not for the fat conscious eater), shredded green onions, and butter (yes, butter!). The third ramen offering, shoyu, is something we'll probably try on the next go. The noodles were chewy-soft and a bit firm which is how it should be, and with a flavor-rich broth that's a cross between creamy melted butter and meaty-savory -- a feat only possible with many hours of high heat infusion of the ingredients. On a hot summer day, the place suffers from the lack of a good a/c, but once you start chowing down your piping hot ramen, the warm ambience fades into obscurity. A definite must-try place that we're glad we stumbled upon!",

The miso ramen has a thicker, chewier noodle (dericious) while the tonkatsu ramen has a thinner noodle that I didn't really care for. I didn't do this, but you could probably ask for the thicker noodle + the tonkatsu broth!   Try to go early to avoid lines! We went around 6 PM, and by the time we left (630), there was a long line outside the door. Everyone seems to be in and out pretty fast, though.",

I had extra meat with mine since the last time the two pieces melted in my mouth quickly.  I ordered extra ramen to pour in my bowl.

    "text": "I've been to some premium ramen joints in North America (Kintaro in Vancouver BC and Ippudo in NYC), so I definitely came in here with tempered expectations.  In addition to the traditional Japanese greeting by the staff as you come in and an open kitchen view of the chefs preparing the food, what struck me was the significant number of older Japanese business men who had come in with their suits folded against their shoulders on a blistering hot summer day to order a steaming bowl of noodles!  That clued me in this was perhaps the real deal.  Being my first time here, I went with the Tonkatsu ramen, which is ramen in pork broth stewed for several hours.  Bonus points for speed since I could have sworn my entree arrived within 2 minutes from the time I ordered.  Step one is tasting the broth:  the broth was at once unctuous and velvety smooth with intense flavors of marrow and porkified goodness without seeming overtly greasy/oily.    Moving onto the noodles, there should definitely be some spring when you chew on the noodles and these were definitely on par with the other places I've visited with just the right amount of \"al dente\" and some umami embedded within the noodles themselves.    Finally there's the pork which is marinated in soy and cut paper thin with a thin lining of fat that has condensed into a perfect strip of pork belly perfection that is just right for the creamy broth it is bathed in since any more would cause the pork to loose it's distinct note.  The basic order also includes some bamboo shoots and kikurage (japanese seaweed) and it is a steal of a deal at 6.99, but I think what would have completed my experience was the addition of a few toppings such spring onions or mustard greens (for a few bucks more) to cut through the richness of the broth and add some additional textures and color.  There is also the option to add a hard-boiled egg or to get an extra serving of noodles if you're needing something more substantial.  All in all, definitely an authentic joint that measures up to the greats and will be somewhere I will frequent again and again especially during the colder months.",

Got here at about 6:30 pm and was able to get a seat right away at the bar.  Ordered a Shoyu ramen with extra pork and egg.  Even though my friend recommended the kimchee fried rice I was here to sample the ramen.    The ramen came out pretty quick, noodles were nice and crisp and the broth was clean and not too salty as others have said.  The pork was sliced very thing, but it was very flavorful and melt in your mouth delicious.  The egg was also very good, rivaling the egg here in San Diego at Yakiyudori.

Got here a little early and luckily was seated right away at the counter.  Service was good they quickly took my order and I had a front row seat watching them prepare all of the goodness that they do.    Started off with the Goyza and it was pretty good. The filling could have had a little more spice to it but it did the trick.  For the main I had the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra pork.  The portion was a good size and the extra pork was a nice addition.  I added some spicy sauce to give it a little more of a kick but it was quality.   One thing that I thought was odd was the green ice tea came in a can. Never seen that before but it was good.  I prefer fresh brewed but that would be the only downside to the visit.

Spicy Tonkatsu: I wasnt expecting much from the broth, but oh my goodness did it have some depth to it. I was diving 20,000 leagues under the broth. It wasnt heavy, but it had so much flavor. The noodles were okay and the chashu held its own, but the broth was clearly the star of the show. I only wish I didnt get it spicy because the spice wasnt doing the broth justice and just made the soup too salty. 4/5.  Black Garlic: Broth was a bit too salty for my liking. Flavor was good overall. 3/5.  Fried Rice: Very standard fried rice. The chashu needed more flavor to carry the dish though. 3.5/5.  Pork Belly Bowl: Okay, this was probably my favorite thing here. The bork was so soft, but had just the right amount of flavor to it and wasnt tough whatsoever. Make sure to add some hot oil or some of you broth to the bowl (you're welcome). 5/5.  2 ramens and 2 mini rice bowls only came out to $30 after tax and tip. You're paying that much for almost one bowl at stupid ass ramen dojo in the bay area.   You definitely get your money's worth here. If you are from the bay, give this place a try. You will understand what I mean.",

As the matter of fact, because of good customer service, the food just taste better. I wouldn't say that the ramen is a big WOW compared to a lot of other places we have been to. But it wasn't salty or bland, just right. The place is small so expect a wait time to be longer than 15 to 30 minutes and make sure your party is ALLL there. It is only fair to other people who's waiting. My family and I would come back here again if we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "If you do plan on coming here, try your best to avoid dinner time. My boyfriend and I came around 7pm and waited about an hour to be seated.   It's a super small restaurant with literally 5 tables and a booth that fits about 8 people. There were people waiting inside and outside, which sucks especially when it's cold and people are hungry. You have to fill out a sheet with the number of people in your party and where you'd like to be seated, then they call people out to seat them accordingly.   Once we got seated we were immediately served with drinks and the waitress took our orders. The staff works quickly to get people seated and fed. We sat for about 5 minutes and our food was already made and set in front of us. That's a bonus!  I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen with corn and flavored egg, my boyfriend got the regular tonkotsu ramen with nori and extra noodles. The broth was thicker than i expected but the meat and noodles were delicious. They really fill up your bowl to the max.  We also ordered the regular fried rice, just like everyone else in the restaurant. We could see why it was popular, it's freaking delicious and I would definitely order the fried rice to go!   Four stars because they should expand the place to make it bigger especially since they have such a huge crowd of customers coming in.",

Highly recommend ordering they're gyoza and pork belly bowl over fried rice (special order).   Montas is a must every time we're in Vegas.  The place is super small and can only accommodate a few parties at a time.  If you can get on the counter, do it, cause you won't be talking much while devouring your meal anyway.  Wait times can be long but it'll be well with it.  P2P is outstanding   You'd be a fool to skip this place... but if you do that's ok so we can get in faster.  Arigato Montas!!!",

As you slurped it up the spice came with the noodles and it's quite rich (not that thick tho).  The miso ramen had a much more wholesome broth that you could drink and the noodles were a bit thicker. In that ramen, I feel like you wanted to eat noodles with the broth ( like one bite after another) to really enjoy it.  One thing was that the egg didn't seem to be marinated with sake, soy sauce, or anything. It just tasted like a soft boiled egg. Also the chasu just seemed soft and fatty and not very flavorful. Perhaps they just expect the broth to flavor it, but I prefer a little marination.  Coming from sf, this was extremely cheap. 10 bucks a person with toppings.",

I always get the tonkotsu ramen when the half boiled egg with the spicy paste. It's a bit on the heavy/greasy side, but overall the taste is excellent. Gyoza is nothing special, so I wouldn't put too much hope in them in my opinion.   Avoid this place during lunch and dinner! It's in a plaza that consists of good restaurants and boba shop. The parking spots are limited and can be hard to find/park. This place opens at 11:30 but people start lining up even before that. But the service is pretty quick so the wait is doable.",

Monta Ramen was the closest one in proximity to where we were staying so we decided to give it a try.   Pulling into the parking lot, I immediately noticed the crowd of asian people waiting outside so you know this place is legit lol. There were about 5 groups ahead of us so I put our name down and waited patiently.   The wait lasted about 30 minutes until we got seated. The place is pretty tiny, but cozy nonetheless. The waitress was very friendly and attentive even though they were so busy.   The first thing i noticed when i looked at the menu were the prices... they were super cheap compared to what I'm used to for Ramen in the bay area. $7 for a bowl of ramen??!!  I was floored.... and in seeing that I was thinking ok.. their portions must be tiny.   I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. When the bowl came out (which was very fast), I was pleasantly surprised.. it was a pretty decent portion!  The taste was excellent too!   Great food, great service, will be back! Also, there's a boba spot right next door, Kung Fu Tea if you need something sweet after dinner!",

The pork they put in their soup is a little on the fatty side and the broth seems to have to not been skimmed enough since it is also oily and fatty.  Interesting atmosphere though.  However I would say that if you want better Ramen go down the street to Ichiza.  Monta has a limited menu of just oily soup while Ichiza is an explosion of variety AND they have better Ramen soup.",

My family were in Vegas and my sister knew of a tasty ramen place so we decided to truck on down to Monta Noodle House.  Over all, the experience was pretty good.  I have to say this stacks up pretty well compared to some of the ramen places in California like Santouka or Shin Sen Gumi.  I think the defining factor is the broth itself.  Whether you're down for thick hearty broth or straight up thin broth, that's up to you.  I personally dig the heartiness of this place and definitely wouldn't mind going here again.

Although at first it seemed like it might be a little basic and not enough, when I received my bowl it was more food than I thought it would be.  The noodles tasted great and the egg was cooked perfectly, not too runny which I don't care for.  The broth was the best, there's something about it that has left me with a craving for it.  Just one bowl left me completely full and satisfied and all for about $8.00!  I must mention that I had gone to an expensive strip restaurant the night before and spent about 15-times that and was so unsatisfied with my food.  The price here for delicious food cannot be beat!  Also worth noting - we arrived exactly at 5pm and there were only 2 parties in front of us.  But within 5-7 minutes of arriving, there was a huge line after us.  The place is small so you might have a wait.",

    "text": "My best friend introduced me to traditional ramen when I went to visit him in California.  I fell in love after the first steaming mouthful.  Since then, I've been trying to find somewhere that can match California's quality, and so far, Monta is the closest I've come in Las Vegas.  I judge a ramen place by their tonkatsu ramen; its the most basic and traditional type.  If they can make tonkatsu, the shoyu and miso are bound to be good.  Such is the case with Monta.  The tonkatsu is creamy and savory, with just the right amount of salt.  Make sure to get a nitamago in there as well; it definitely adds to the texture and flavour.  Considering the flavour and the price, this place is the best in town.",

    "text": "This place is extremely satisfying, especially after a day of hiking. We were able to split a pork belly bowl and potstickers between 3 people. The pork belly was soft but not chewy and very flavorful and the shoyu flavor did not overpower the pork. We added goma to the bowl which gave the pork and rice a rosted, nutty flavor. The potsickers were delicious. The wrapper was thin and crispy and the filling had a slight kick to it, so if you don't enjoy spicy food in anyway I wouldn't recommend ordering these. I ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with an egg and was very satisfied with my choice. The broth was creamy without being too fatty and the chashu pork was soft and melted in my mouth. The egg could have used more seasoning or marinated a bit longer as it was rather flavorless.  The noodles were the right consistency and were neither too chewy or starchy. The service was on par with the food. The wait staff was friendly and came back to check on us often.",

From the moment you enter its cramped, busy little space with a cheerful greeting from the staff to the satisfied feeling of a bellyful of delicious ramen it's a wonderful experience. The ramen is on-par with the real stuff in Japan, and the Tonkotsu and Miso varieties are especially good. The gyoza and fried rice leave a bit to be desired but as this is primarily a ramen restaurant that can be forgiven. The beer is cheap too, with Asahi on tap for about $2.95 a glass. All in all it's a wonderful experience and if you are looking for authentic ramen in Las Vegas this is your best bet.",

There are 2 servers that seem to consistently let me down, where as the other 2 are always great and work together well to make sure they always check up on us.  The Chasu (bbq pork) here is quite good, IMO it is better than the chasu at the well known Daikokuya in Los Angeles. Oddly, they have 2 different types of ramen noodles here that are ASSIGNED to the type of broth you choose and they will NOT let you choose the other noodles with a different broth. I prefer the noodles they use in the miso ramen, but normally prefer a combination of tonkatsu and shoyu broth. The lack of flexibility is a bit upsetting and leaves the foodie in me yearning for food MY WAY.   Fortunately, I tried all of their fried rices and rice bowls and have been pretty happy with all of them. My favorite is the pork belly bowl. YUM!!! I add a bit of the crushed garlic, chili oil, and japanese chili flakes to make it absolutely scrumptious. If you like pork (who doesn't), you MUST try this.",

    "text": "After eating here three times (and already planning to come here forever), I feel I can finally give a thorough review of this ramen shop. Let me just state a few obvious things when you arrive (or before you arrive): 1. This shopping center is almost always packed on the weekends and if you're lucky, you'll get a semi-empty parking lot on the weekdays. It has a ton of other amazing restaurants so it is usually busy.  2. This place is one of the best reviewed ramen shops in Vegas; therefore, expect a line if you go during lunch hours, dinner hours, or any time during the weekends. Luckily, they get people in and out fast and provide really efficient service. 3. It's a small ramen shop in terms of square footage, and smaller parties get priority only because there are more single/double seats (bar seats/small tables) than there are full tables (for 3 or more).   Technical stuff aside, the ramen here is delicious. I have gotten a different one each time: tonkotsu, shoyu, and tonkotsu shoyu.  My boyfriend has ordered the kuro ramen with black garlic oil a few times now as well.  Their broths are flavorful and very rich.  The tonkotsu ramen really coats your mouth with a delicious layer of fat- their chashu will reflect the same. I couldn't believe the flavor and sensation of the chashu melting in my mouth.  If you want something still very rich but not \"coat your mouth\" rich, go for the happy medium with the tonkotsu shoyu ramen.  If you're looking for a very (almost) familiar flavor of ramen, I'd recommend the shoyu ramen. My partner says the kuro ramen with black garlic oil has similar fatty flavors to the tonkotsu, but with (obviously) black garlic oil. I love garlic, and have yet to try this one- so I will update my review once I have!  I definitely recommend corn, nitamago, and kimchi as your toppings. Obviously, if you're into it, extra pork chashu is a must. Their kimchi is very light- not too spicy, and delicious when you eat it with the broth of any bowl; we've gotten it every time and have even shared it with strangers so they can have the delicious experience themselves.  I can't normally convince my boyfriend to go eat ramen with me, it's just not high priority on his list of foods he would rather go eat (sushi, KBBQ, etc.), but he loves Monta Ramen.   We'll each get a bowl of ramen with toppings and drinks, and our bill never comes out to be more than ~$20 before tip! The employees there are quick, efficient, courteous, and hard working.  You definitely get the bang for your buck here, and I can see why they are so well loved in the community. We'll definitely be coming here for our ramen needs forever.",

I come here especially for the chashu bowl; the cut of pork that they have is unlike any other, so much so that when I'm away from Sin City, I'm dreaming about this chashu. Of course, the ramen here is also very good, worthy of top Nom-nom awards; I'm a fan of the Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu Shoyu broths. Expect to wait awhile, but it's totally worth it. Itadakimasu!",

We also ordered the Pan-fried pork and veggie Gyoza that was perfectly crisp on one side. It is a small restaurant that looks to seat a guesstimate of 30 people. There's usually a wait that doesn't is usually 15-30 minutes, but we got lucky and there wasn't a wait. It was a fair price for 2. $25 together. We will be returning!",

I also like the cold yuzu ramen that is good for a hot summer day. It's refreshing and acidic with plenty of vegetables for when your'e not feeling a warm umami broth. I don't like the fact that the parking complex is extremely difficult to find any space and is often crowded with the wait.

I came here with friends and didn't choose the place so I didn't know it was not vegetarian friendly. Sadly that meant I couldn't partake in the ramen but I settled for fried rice (not the restaurant's fault I'm vegetarian after all).   I ended paying about $6.00 for a tiny serving of rice. Mind you, I got a size that was supposedly a full meal. When I asked the waitress to substitute the ham for egg, corn, or anything vegetarian friendly, she refused. Instead, she insisted I pay extra for each of those items.   I have never been to a place less accommodating to dietary restrictions in my entire life. I've also never been to a place that would charge me extra for a substitute that would be cheaper than the meat that comes with the meal. For the rudeness and inflexibility combined with a tiny and expensive portion of rice that was ordinary at best, I can't give this place any more stars.   Ps My friends said the ramen was good so I recommend the ramen to the carnivorous people out there.",

    "text": "Of all things Ramen,Japanese, and delicious, Monta Ramen on Spring Mountain Blvd falls right in the middle. It's nothing mind blowing, nor is it terrible, hence the 3stars.   First off... Place is SUPER TINY. So expect a wait and make sure to write your name down. Even when it's not packed, it get packed pretty quickly... And because it's so tiny, it tends to get uncomfortable when it's packed... And that's uncomfortable on both the eating and waiting end. Eating coz all the tables are close, even the bar area is hardly comfortable elbow room for the seats next to each other. And also when it's a long wait and you're eating, you seriously feel like EVERYONE waiting is watching you eat to see how much longer you will be sitting down. Uncomfortable on the waiting end coz there's not much of a waiting area at all. If you have issue with confined spaces... Not the place for you my friend.   The decor and seating does follow the more traditional Japanese ramen house with it being a small narrow restaurant, with wood tables and seatings. I noticed most if not all servers are Japanese so it keeps to the authenticity. Minus the Hispanic cooks lol   The food is good. Price is definitely what keeps me coming back and dealing with the wait and tight space tho. The taste and flavors aren't mind blowing and it's nothing to rave about to your friends.  But it's definitely somewhere I can easily say \"I got the bill tonight\" without regretting it and feeling like I broke my wallet over a filling meal. I will say the portions are great for the cheap prices.   My favorite actually is not the ramen here but the pork belly bowl. The pork belly is cooked just right; not over or under cooked and just the right amount of sauce in the right to compliment the flavors of the pork belly. For me... That's the ticket item that has me returning. Plus another good point is service is fairly quick... BUT they have to be... They need their customers revolving in and out to accommodate for lack of space.   Tbh the location in Henderson is better. Just this area is closer to my house than Henderson. The ramen can tend to be too salty for my palate... But again like I said it's not amazing but it's not terrible. But definitely worth going for the prices and the pork belly bowl! Nom nom nom",

We went here for dinner and the food was as good as everyone says, but it definitely is not worth the trouble of the fraudulent activities. They were smart about it too. They only started charging stuff after a week or two from our visit. I honestly didn't want to believe it at first, but 3 people out of our 5 group party which one of us paid cash is not just a coincidence. We all didn't go anywhere else out of the norm between our dinner at Monta and when the fraudulent charges occurred.   This disappoints me because the Ramen is so good. You might say \"why don't you just use cash next time\" but it's just my stance that if a place can allow that to happen I will not spend my hard earned money there. So with that being said if you choose to eat here be careful. As for me my search for a new Ramen place begins.",

Always a good sign!  +Monta has 4 soup broth to choose from: Tonkotsu, tonkotsu-shoyu, shoyu, and miso. Always nice to have varieties since I'm sick of just eating tonkotsu at every single ramen shop. My boyfriend and I both ordered Tonkotsu-Shoyu but I opted for chijire men (thick, wavy noodles) and it was awesome! The noodles had great consistency and the soup was spot on.  +Their 6 piece gyoza tasted like legit ramen shop gyozas. Yum!  -Limited seatings. There are four desks that seats four people, one desk that seats two people, and 9 seats available at the counter.  -Line forms even before opening! My boyfriend and I got to Monta a little too early around 11AM. We were waiting in the car and people started trickling in around 11:15AM and there was mini line formed already before opening! Since it's limited seating, the people in line will fill up the restaurant and there will be constant flow of customers/wait time during lunch peak hours.  -I read someone's review that they had great fried rice so I ordered it but it was a-okay. I've had better ramen shop fried rice before so I will not order it again if I visit Monta.  Monta needs to definitely open a shop in LA. Cannot wait to eat Monta until my next visit to Vegas!",

Getting seated and order was fast for such a tiny place that was packed, we got the kuro ramen which is the black bean garlic noddles. Taste similar to Tiger Den in Houston but not as good, I would come back for this if in town. Service wise it was good, only two waitress for a busy place and they checked in on us to see if everything was okay.   Overall my belly was happy and satisfied, if you want noodles after a massage then try this place then hit up Kung Fu for milk tea (just right next door to each other). Location is super convenient, not too far from the Vegas strip.",

    "text": "Food: 4 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 3. Cramped in a strip mall (which is of course typical in LV.). It is located in the same strip mall as another popular Japanese place, Raku.  FIRST IMPRESSION and ORDERING As we stood waiting for about maybe 15-20 min, we peeked over to the table of 4 who were eating on a table smack right next to the entry door where everyone was standing & waiting. We saw that the fried rice looked a tad greasy and so did the ramen broth. My dinner companion gave me that look of \"hmmm\" and I said \"I guess we'll just try it since we're already here\". We were curious to compare this to our usual Ramen Dojo (San Mateo, CA).  We ordered one tonkotsu $6.95 (+egg $1.50  and corn $0.50), one shoyu ramen $6.95 with extra chasu (+4 pieces, $2.50) and one kimchi fried rice $6.95 (hoping this would be less greasy than the regular fried rice and it was slightly less common in the Ramen place).  Having not eaten lunch that day, we were huuungry and ready to devour our order as soon as it arrived. First impression: noodles presentation looked neat and mouthwatering; the ingredients were neatly arranged on top and the bowl of ramen looked quite appetizing. Especially with 2 hungry stomachs impatiently waiting to devour them. LOL.   The broth didn't appear as greasy as my earlier glance at the previous table.  There was a curious black ring around each of the chasu (more about this later) that's usually not present in the other ramen's place chasu piece.  Interesting, we thought.  The fried rice still looked a tad on the greasy side by the shines it showed. But in all fairness, I haven't ordered Japanese fried rice in a ramen place for some time. Maybe they all look like that.  Now on to the fun part.  FOOD The broth on the tonkotsu ramen was delish. Slightly on the lighter side compared to Ramen Dojo, but it was still good. One big difference that made Ramen Dojo's broth more 'hearty' and tasty was the addition of chicken bits in their broths. If you like a lighter version of Tonkotsu broth, you will like Monta's version better.  The shoyu broth was light yet had a lot of flavor.   The tonkotsu bowl came with thin noodles. We both were very curious how good (smooth) this thin noodle would be. While not as 'smooth' as some of the other thin ramen noodles we've tried in Japan, we were pleasantly surprised at how smooth and tasty it was. So, thumbs up here.  The noodles in the shoyu bowl was also pretty good. It is the yellow, thicker, curly kind; of course heavier than the one in the tonkotsu bowl, yet not super-heavy.  As for the curious black ring around the chasu, as you probably have guessed, it is the pork skin. The skin itself was a real thin strip with a very thin layer of fat underneath it.  Including this skin gave the soup broth an extra flavor and aroma that distinguished it from other ramen's place broth. It was probably also why the half-finished ramen bowl we peeked earlier looked slightly greasier. I don't typically see this pork skin included in other ramen shop. This is a plus for the broth. The slightly greasier broth didn't quite happen as much in my bowl. 'cause I like to scrape off the fat under the pork skin. LOL. Another thumbs up!  The last dish which was the kimchee fried rice ($6.95) was yum, though I still think it could be done with slightly less oil.  Unlike the rice bowl-sized portion that it often comes in, this fried rice came in a rounded square plate of the size that could've been a meal by itself.  SERVICE Service was friendly, efficient and brisk without making us feel rushed. But we did devoured our meal super fast and left quickly as a courtesy to the long lines of people waiting.  Two thumbs up for this place.  ANECDOTAL COMMENTS & OBSERVATIONS (mostly rhetorical) Why is it that most ramen house has the most 'house rules' posted on their outside window? No outside food. No outside drink. No tacos? (seriously, this place has a picture of tacos with a cross on it and Japanese writing).",

    "text": "I've looked far and wide for a good Ramen shop that would satisfy my appetite for real Japanese style Ramen.  Oh how I've shed many tears over the prepackaged Ramen that I was forced to eat, because I just couldn't get the real deal.  Well my days of sadness are over since Monta Ramen has come into my life.  Now the world is good again....   I usually go for the the tonkotsu Ramen, but have been known to dip my chopsticks into the tonkotsu-shoyu broth as well.  Both flavors are deep and rich, and each has a creamy texture that can only come from long, slow simmering.  The main difference between these two types of broths comes in the form of a lil more salty punch that the tonkotsu-shoyu has.   The noodles are firm (but not too firm) and thin and have a great mellow flavor that balances out the saltiness of the broths.  On their menu it states that you can get an extra helping of these noodles for a very small fee.  I've tried to finish an extra helping of the noodles twice, and have failed both times.  It is a really huge a portion of food, and in my version of man vs. food, food most defiantly won.  Along with the noodles you get a selection of side items you can add to your Ramen.   I would recommend adding the egg and corn they taste great in the Ramen, and turn it into a really substantial meal.    The last thing I'm going to say about this great Las Vegas Ramen shop is that the staff is, and has always been friendly and attentive (I never go more two minutes without having my water glass filled).",

Before there was Monta, there were only two real places to get Ramen here in Vegas. One was Togoshi (which sadly had closed) and Kaigenro (which still has some pretty excellent ramen, BTW). Enter Monta...a fresh new take on a small niche market here in sin city.   And let me tell you, after that first sip of the soup and the first snap of the fresh noodles, I was instantly transported back to Japan. Even for just a fleeting moment, I forgot all about the hustle and bustle of day to day life here and was \"home\" for the duration of a bowl or ramen.   Their chashu is out of this world!  the menu is kept simple with three main variations of ramen: shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu...all of which are absolute trips back in time, like being back in Japan.   Now only if they served beer...........",

    "text": "Mmmmm, thank you Yelp, this place is good, I love Ramen and this place reminds me of Orochon Ramen in Los Angeles. Not necessarily better but for Las Vegas this might be one of the best.   Pros: The Shoyu Ramen and Tonkatsu were so good with extra green onion and chashu. My friend didn't like the chashu (pork) so much because she felt it was a weird texture thing but I loved it, put extra in mine and took hers, so my gain! Tonkatsu noodles were good, and the egg was good but you had to let it sit in the hot broth for awhile, otherwise you'd realize that they tossed a cold egg in there. Service was good, very friendly and nice.  The biggest cons were the size and the temperature. I got there early so I was able to secure a spot at the bar but outside of that, there were three small table for maybe four, and a group of eight sitting together and that's all there was room for. I couldn't imagine what this place is like during lunch hour or dinner. When I first arrived I didn't think the temperature was that bad since they have fans everywhere. But after eating hot ramen, having a couple Asahis, and being right next to the busy kitchen, the sweat started coming (felt like I was cutting weight for a fight) but it's manageable. All in all, I will definitely be coming back here",

    "text": "I was extremely excited to find out that there was a new ramen restaurant in town.  I finally got the chance to try it today.  I was a little apprehensive after reading all the reviews about the heat inside and the rude service.  Well, as usual, I was only customer at 3 pm.  The first thing I noticed was the temperature.  Sure it was hot and humid, but they have large vats of soup and hot water boiling away, so it was to be expected.  I think they had the A/C on full because it was definitely tolerable.  Next was the waitress.  The one that helped me was very friendly and helpful.  She checked up on me regularly.  So good news, maybe the owner read the reviews and critiques on Yelp and decided to do something.  As for the food, I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with egg and extra premium green onion.  Since I was the only person in there, my order came quickly.  The size of the bowl was a bit on the small size.  Two, nice, fatty, pieces of pork floated underneath a mound of slivered green onions.  I quickly tried a piece of the char-su.  The meat was extremely tender, as tender as the fat and their was a nice ring of flavor on the outside.  Made me wish they gave me more.  The broth was nice an rich, not too salty and the noodles were cooked to a nice al dente, so they were chewy and adsorbed some of the broth.  After sampling everything, I added some minced garlic and chili powder to my bowl.  They also had the pickled ginger, toasted sesame seeds, white pepper, sesame seed oil, and some other condiments so I could season my noodles just the way I wanted.  That was a big plus.    Overall, I was very happy with the flavor of my tonkotsu ramen, the service, and the A/C.  I would have given this place 4 stars, but the price was a little too steep for the smaller than average sized bowl.  I would definitely go back to take care of any future ramen cravings and try the miso ramen!",

    "text": "I tried this place out because my friends frequent this place especially during Saturday mornings after pick up basketball. Anyway, I had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and the Chasu Pork Bowl.   I'm not a food critic in any way but comparing it to Sora, I can notice a lot of differences. One is well Sora doesn't have Tonkotsu Shoyu in the menu. But with Monta's serving I was quite disappointed. The broth felt greasy and almost instantly left a line of fat/grease on my lips. Although it is good, certain people don't like that feeling when eating. It is creamy and rich but Minus points on the grease. The pork on the Ramen Bowl is only one slice hidden behind bamboo shoots and mushrooms. If I didn't dig through the bowl I wouldn't have even found it. The noodles were okay, but it felt like as if they were just about cooked when the chef took it out from the pot. It felt as if it needed about a minute more in cooking. The server was very nice, refilling our water glasses almost every time we downed a glass. So fast it felt like she was on a mission. The Chasu Bowl was very good however, the shredded Nori on top was surprising and the meat was tender and tasty. It was sweet on the outside part of the cut just how Chasu should taste like. I wasn't blown away by the food but it was a good meal for a hungry man like me. I'd give Monta a second try but probably would not be my go-to Ramen joint.",

    "text": "Omg, what a great idea to come after a night of hard partying at EDC. My friend found Monta Ramen on Yelp, and once our whole crew woke up from drunken slumber, we hopped in our car and headed straight for ramen!!  I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen which is the most popular and also the Takana friend rice. The soup for the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen was a little bit salty, but the pork was the best thing ever. Wow, it is so tender and tasty, totally worth it- just don't finish the soup. I wish there were more pieces in my ramen, but you can always add more! Also, as recommended by our waitress, the Takana friend rice is a must. It was really delicious and I wish my stomach would have let me eat more.   Overall, Monta Ramen is a cute little ramen place in the Chinatown/ asia food area off the strip. The food is decent, great for hangovers and the service is also really friendly. Although where we sat is spacious, this place gets super packed. Prepare yourself for a wait because the restaurant is small and can only accommodate a few tables / seating at the bar at a time.",

I got the tonkatsu and this time I avoided the mustard greens hoping to reduce the salty taste. Pretty good, but the broth is still a little too salty for me. My fella loved it and he'd probably give it a higher rating, so maybe it's just me.  It'll still be my go-to place for ramen in town though.",

One important tip...if you see that it's packed you must go to the podium and sign in.  And FYI it is a very quaint place (small) Seats are limited.

I've tried at least a dozen times to go, but because this place is so small, the wait is usually very long and I'm not patient enough to wait in a long line for Ramen.  However, this past trip we went at a great time in-between lunch/dinner when there was no wait list.  I ordered:  Small Fried Rice, $3.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g#w5AX4KwSXtzmxSEt-vej8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw#391aM_l0lDis4oAtZPcTaw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>  Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen, $7.25 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg#cMExaL7ebqN31EuREScnlg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg#g152vHdE64gsXDp65vDoGg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>  Miso Ramen (no meat), $7.25 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ#N4jGhfIm1nN5oyNe0EwrIQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mont...</a>  The portions here are much smaller than other Ramen places I've been to.  If you're accustomed to the large portions in So Cal Ramen joints, be warned that the portions here is about 3/4 those portions.  The Fried Rice was very good and hit the spot.  The Ramen was very good, full of flavor.  I had the Veggie Miso Ramen and it was awesome.  The Better Half had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.  Other notes:  They make the Ramen fresh to order, so it's a bit of a wait.  There's also counter seating available for convenience.  We sat at the counter and watched them make the dishes....pretty cool.  Did it live up to the hype?  It met my expectations and was definitely 4 Stars in my opinion.  Return Factor - 80%",

We went around 1pm on a Saturday and had to wait about 15 minutes for a seat.   Ordered the Miso Ramen and the broth was really good, but a bit too salty for my taste, but still really good. The pork was really good, and the noodles were best towards the end of the meal because they had gotten softer after soaking in the juices. Initially they were more Al dente.   Since this is my first visit to a ramen restaurant in las vegas, I'll probably try a different one the next time around so I have something to compare it to.",

However, it's in Vegas and not in the East Los Angeles County area :o(  I had the Tonkostsu with a Chicken/beef broth.  It was perfect!  The combination of a heavy beef broth with the lighter chicken broth was absolutely delightful.  The best part is the price.  It's a fair price for what you get and if you're in Vegas and don't want to pay all that money for a 'fancy' meal or get crappy buffet food.  Take a trip off the strip to try out this place.  It's well worth the trip and believe me, every time I come to Vegas this is going to be a must stop for me!  Cheers and Eat Responsibly!",

As soon as you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a very cute Japanese girl worker and are seated right away. The restaurant is small, but very cozy. We ordered the tonkotsu ramen with a boiled egg on the side and were very impressed at how delicious the bowl of soup was. Although the bowl only comes with two thin slices of pork, the pork itself is very tender and is soaked in that delicious broth making you savor each bite! The broth is cloudy like it should be and wasn't too salty or too bland for my taste. What really impressed me was the poached egg. The article talked about how perfectly poached the eggs were there and boy was he right! The egg was not too runny nor too cooked. The combination of the runny yolk and broth tasted like heaven in my mouth!   Overall, the food and service were excellent. It was also a very authentic experience for me since the worker's demeanor reminded me of my time in Japan. Very perky, always smiling and had a cute high pitched voice! Come here to enjoy a delicious bowl of ramen and experience a little taste of Japan!",

The vibe here is clean and chill. Describe this place in one word is impossible. There is always a wait here. The place packs the crowd and flavors. This isn't somewhere you want to go if your party exceeds more than 5-6 people.   The ramen is tasty and reasonable priced. The Kim Chee fried rice is delish! The gyoza is pretty tasty too.   If you plan on headed here for some dinner and casual conversation...don't. Enjoy the dinner but take your casual conversation elsewhere because sitting their too long and not eating is just being selfish to people who also want to indulge in the warmth and tastiness of Monta Ramen!",

Maybe I had higher expectations of this place, even though I had nothing to compare it to other than the ramen you get for .20 at the local grocery store. It was good. Very good even. I ordered the pork/chicken broth ramen add corn and butter. I ate the entire bowl and would order it again. I personally chose to add a little chile oil and whatever that mixed seasoning at the table was. It def improved my broth which needed the extra umph. The pork in the soup was not my style. The fatty skin reminded me of duck, which I don't like the skin of. Everything else in the soup was yummy and ill consider adding extra mushrooms and maybe an egg next time.  Good prices, I'd much rather go order a $7 bowl of ramen, versus buying all those ingredients and doing it myself. However, how often do I eat ramen is really the question here, maybe that's why I expected it to be something more than basic. Ill consider ramen again, as long as I don't have to wait (which you usually do considering they have like 6 tables) or possibly order it Togo. I did notice that was an option. Next time ill try Sora or Fukumimi.",

Traditional tonkotsu has a thick soup base made of pork bones that takes more than 24 hours to make. This version is watery.  Traditional tonkotsu has this mix of flavors that leaves you feeling satisfied, and wanting for more. This version is too salty, and I left with a stomach discomfort.  I'd like the next set of yelp reviewers to be honest with themselves when I say that there is a FECAL aftertaste to this place's pork topping.  In short, I would have been better off buying the 50 cent Nissin instant noodles, top it with some meat, and feel happier.  For a comparison of a good tonkotsu, if you can't travel to Japan, try Daikokuya in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo, and your taste buds will be blown by the difference.  I will not eat here again.",

Today I made the trip with my brother.  We got here about 10 minutes after they opened and found the last remaining table.  The place was already packed.  After looking at the menu I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen which is a rich pork broth with two slices of melt in your mouth pork with wood-ear mushrooms and scallions.  I added the Nitamago which is a seasoned hard-boiled egg.  This meal did not disappoint.  It came to the table within 10 minutes and was a great looking bowl of ramen.  Very savory and fresh.  We also had the Gyoza  which is a pan-fried pork and vegetable dumpling.  My brother ordered the Takana pork-fried rice.  This rice was a nice addition to our ramen bowls.    Just a note:  As our ramen bowls were delivered I looked up and noticed that Monta Ramen must have a lot of fans because the little doorway was filled with people waiting to eat but the line also went out the door.   Knowing what I do now about how delicious this ramen is I would have gladly waited outside for my turn to enjoy this bowl.    Monta Ramen will definitely be on my list to visit the next time I come to Las Vegas.  Can't wait to bring my wife here.  Very affordable.  I recommend.",

I just went to eat my favorite ramen like 10 mins ago. They were busy as always even they just opened. My party was the last seated table before they got so busy. Since they just opened, people were waiting to order or to get their food. It was understandable to wait to order food to server until one of the server just yelled at us \"it's first come first serves, so wait please\" I was like okay..? I didn't even ask you anything all i did is just had some eye contact but okay I'm cool. But, when she finally take our order, she didn't even wait until i finished my order. And, when i asked her for two iced water with lemon, she answered \" no lemon\" while she was walking away from our table. That was such a disrespectful manner as a server. I would understand if she just said the same answer while she was standing side to us. After that, again they were busy, so we waited for the food not too long, but a just little bit. But, even she delivered wrong food to our table and we asked her if she is sure it's ours. And, as before, she just answered \"yes\" while she walking away from table. I was okay with that. But, i was sure that it was not mine. And guess what. She just came back to our table saying sorry it's not mine and grabbed the bowl to give to the other customer. Finally, we got our food. Food was delicious as always. But, all the servers, they never come to us to make sure if we are okay with everything except when we are paying the bill. Like i said, it is understandable that i cannot expect such an amazing customer service. But, it's different and such a disrespectful to customer when it's repeated on same day. I did not want to tip to server. But, food was good. So, i tipped to the chefs who worked so hard in the kitchen.",

    "text": "I've probably been to Monta Ramen about 20+ times now, and in my opinion it's the best ramen noodle shop in town (Fukumimi does come close in my opinion....more on that in another review.   The Food (5 out of 5): I usually order either the Tonkotsu Shoyu or the Miso Ramen and then add an egg. I absolutely love their broth (I am a big fan of salt after all). At times, we will order gyoza and/or fried rice to go along with our orders of ramen, and that is usually a good way to round out the meal.  The Service (4 out of 5): I love how fast the turnover of tables is after a patron as left because there is usually a line of people waiting to get in. This is my only True gripe about Monta; I just wish that they had just a little more seating room. HINT: If you go here for lunch, they open at 11:30am......just make sure that you are a couple of minutes early otherwise you will be waiting about 20-30 mins to get seated.  The Price (5 out of 5):  Ok, I guess that this could be better if it were FREE, but come on, that's not going to happen! But, you shouldn't be paying any more than $20 pp here (more like $10-12 pp if you're not getting any extras and/or having water as your drink).   OVERALL: Monta Ramen is at the top of the pack for Japanese ramen noodle shops in Las Vegas in my opinion!",

The service was quick and friendly but the place felt a bit dirty, was a bit dark, and the seating was very cramped together.    I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with flavored eggs and seaweed.  Do Not Order this.   The broth was disappointingly salty and thick.   Seriously salty!  I had to go through 2 full cups of water and I still felt that wasn't enough.   After 1/3 of the way, I had to eat the ramen without the broth, which was unfortunate because the broth is what makes the ramen.  On the upper side, the noodles and eggs were perfectly cooked!  Would I come back?  Probably not.   Again, don't order the tonkotsu ramen unless you want to be on a sodium high.",

It's also much more crowded and noisy, neither of which I like. I'm not sure id go out of my way to go back.",

I don't mean that the flesh of canine is declared an option on the menu, but that they served Koreans, and owner, those surreptitious eyes, the stink of deceit that crowns his air of pretense, that's what I mean.  The noodles were stringy, the broth blooming with oil vessels and the char-siu portions niggardly (I can say that word only because I'm black and East Coast educated).  I would recommend Fukumimi for the woody ambience and specials, or I could recommend Misoya-Tomi for their customer loyalty program, but this place is a crowded dump with teak wood benches that need a massage of Old English and customers that haven't evolved away from being too familiar and conspecific with the species of c. lupus.

I always order the same thing:  Gyoza = perfectly cooked add a little soy sauce w/ chili oil and its a perfect match  Tonkotsu-shoyu ramen and add an egg and nori and it could not be any better. Service is always friendly, and wait is never too long usually. worth the wait if you have to wait though. Not a good place for parties of more than 4, more of a place for 2 ppl so you can do the bar if need be.   Best thing is food always comes out quick and never disappointed. Small place, when you are inside you don't feel like your in vegas at all. And that is a great feeling, especially for someone who has been here for 8 years already.",

I definitely prefer the tonkotsu ramen. So much more flavor!!! Kaedama is a plus. Service -  Once you are seated, they get you in and out pretty quickly. They are really good about filling your water glass, I've noticed a lot of ramen places tend to forget about the water. Ambiance- Small with very little tables. The counter space tends to have quicker turn around so if you are going there solo or as a couple you will get seated a lot quicker.  Other-  Parking is easy and this lot has quite a bit of restaurants. While waiting for your table, walk about the area and plan your next meal.",

    "text": "I'm not a big fan of Monta, maybe it's because I get sick every time I come here and eat something with the charsui (which I figured out after I was about to give up). Everyone else claims it's the best ramen in Las Vegas, maybe, but I haven't been to enough places around to say for certain just yet. So far it's a no for me, because of the way I get sick.  Growing up in Japan with a Chinese family, I know what good ramen tastes like and they're decent but when they're busy the noodles are hard (not cooked long enough) which I hate, they have to be consistant! And on top of that I can't eat the charsui without getting sick which then it's game over for me for the day, so it usually ends with me giving it away to someone.   So like I said, when it's busy they're not that consistant because they're trying to keep up with the demand and not be slow, but it shows in their cooking. I always get gyoza with my ramen and would feel weird if I didn't! Something I've done since I was a little child, besides the pair together taste great!   The soup base itself is light as it should be, though sometimes I feel it's a bit salty (maybe my Asian taste buds were a little too active then, but it's good. Also depends on the one you want, I'm pretty traditional and don't stray from the shoyu (soy sauce base). The noodles is a hit and miss, since they're usually busy and rarely not, though I like going when most people aren't eating, the noodle can be either perfect or too hard for me. People like their noodles differently and not many places give you an option (very few in Japan do), but like I said hit and miss usually it's okay.   Outside of their regular toppings you can add extra stuff like corn, butter, green onions, etc for some extra costs which isn't much at all! They also have kaedame which is a second helping of noodles, but you need to leave some soup base and not drink it if you're going to do that.  Overall the price for what you get is decent and not too bad especially comparing it to places in Japan. My only complaint is that the charsui gets me sick every time I've eaten it and since I've stopped it's been okay.",

    "text": "Monta probably deserves a good rating by default just for the novelty of having a kurume ramen spot in Las Vegas, but it's also a very good one. Kurume style ramen is a product of Fukuoka prefecture, so there are many similarities to other Fukuoka styles like Hakata, such as the thin, dense noodles (think Ippudo) - but a defining characteristic of Kurume is that the tonkotsu tends to be less oily/fatty than Hakata tonokotsu. Kurume style is still creamy and rich, but the mouth feel of less oil/fat allows for more of the meat flavor to come through. Monta definitely gets this right.  Unfortunately, Monta is a small shop and quite popular, so it's often busy and crowded. Even on weekdays I'll often find that there's a line by noon - so I'd definitely get there right at opening if you don't want to wait (as long).  Now if only the owners/management can get their act together and relocate Monta Chaya (and keep us updated about it), if nothing else than to reduce the crowds at this Monta...",

When I was just finished my ramen and taking my beer for finishing, the waitress came and took my bowl that was annoying and she wanted to push me to check out. However, no one was sitting at any tables and I was sitting at bar with some customers. There was no need to push me out while the restaurant was not busy.   I had Tonkotsu Ramen as my late night dinner at Monta Ramen. Mmm........ the soup didn't taste so Japanese Tonkotsu (as I know Japanese food for 29 years). As usual, all people inside kitchen were Hispanics. Although the reviews for this ramen shop were good, their quality of ramen was not that good to me. Not authentic. The only good thing that I thought  was the prices on ramen and beer. The basic ramen with 2 slices of pork Cha-Shiu, Black kikurage bamboo shoots, and green onions was only $6.95 + Tax & Tips. I added flavored egg  $1.50, corn  $0.50, and Nori (dried seaweed) $0.75.  The about 12 oz Asahi Draft beer  was only $2.95 + Tax & Tips. If I had both ramen and beer in New York City, I would need to pay about $24 including Tax & Tips. But today I only paid $15.59 including Tax&Tips. The quality against the low prices was acceptable but please don't expect too much. I would like to pay more for real authentic ramen.",

He told me straight up I either need to \"down it\" or throw it out. I was so taken back that I thought I was on the show Punk'd. I wouldn't mind tossing it but first of all the rule is dumb. I'm a 32 year old businessman with plenty of money, I can afford (and even offered) to buy a drink from their restaurant if it was going to be a real problem.  They weren't accepting of that and continued to harass me about having any outside drink. The waiter said that there's a sign as I was in, but the sign is barely visible as it's off to the left and looks like it was drawn by a kindergartener.  I must have eaten here over 100 times since living in Vegas for the past 10 years, but no more will I patronize this establishment. I'm a strong believer in the notion that I vote with my dollar and I'm not voting for this place ever again unless they change their predatory rule.",

I have had Noodles and ramen all over Vegas and this is by far in the top three for Noodle choices here in town for you Noodle junkies out there like me.  I believe in sticking with what works so I normally order the same thing but I have tried everything on their menu.  My normal order consists of the Mini Mentaiko Bowl which is amazing, the Takana Fried Rice (quite possibly the best fried rice in Las Vegas), and the Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen (I cannot put into words how excellent this Bowl of Noodles is.) Though a little tricky to find, make sure you check this place out, I promise you that you will go back again and again!",

Be prepared to wait a long time if you go with a party of 3 or more. We came with 4 and had to wait for one of the four-seat tables to vacate. It was kind of awkward standing in a cramped entrance staring down folks who are eating in your to-be seats.  I ordered the black ramen just to try something new, but it was unflavorful. By the time I finished adding condiments, it pretty much became a Thai noodle soup.  The overall service was nice and quick, though none of the servers were smiling.  I probably won't be back on my next Vegas trip.",

To me, their Tonkostu broth is very think and heavy. If you prefer your broths on the heavier side, this place is for you.   I prefer their Shoyu ramen where the broth is chicken stock. It's not to heavy.   Mind you, this place is usually packed so you have to be a little patience, but overall, this place isn't to bad.   I'd still prefer other ramen places though.

Due to limited time on Yelp search, I didn't read anyone's reviews, just quickly bookmarked highest rated 3.  I picked this one as it was closest from the hotel I was staying. After I ordered my food, the person who sat next to me at the counter said so much good thing about this place over other places I bookmarked.  Gyoza was good.  I gave a piece to a stranger sat next to me as he gave me this look that he wanted to try.  Ramen..... Well broth was nice and hot... I ate ramen as soon as I took one picture but noodle was soft. It's Hakata thin noodle, perhaps I should have requested barikata (very hard) for my noodle. If their noodle was al dente, I would have given this place 4 stars.  After I was done eating I finally saw some reviews from some of my favorite yelpers. They all rated 3... Ah of course.  I looked at the stranger next to me, he ate so slow, his noodle looked soggy.  Either he doesn't know how to eat ramen in Japanese way or too busy talking to me.   If you like ramen in Japanese way, may want t ask to cook noodle al dente to fully enjoy it's texture.",

Thanks to one of my friends' extended knowledge, we decided to grab ramen in Chinatown at her favorite place, Monta. The shop isn't particularly big and I guess people heard about the hype so there can be a 20-40 minute wait a lot of the time.   I got the tonkatsu ramen and the base price is such a great deal at just $6.75. I added corn for $1 extra and my friend and I also shared the fried rice. You also have to purchase green tea and it comes hot in a can (so interesting). Still, after all that, our total was $32 after tax which is such a great deal!

The Spring Mountain Road strip mall location where Monta Ramen is located is seemingly blessed because it features two authentic and amazing food locales that I was lucky enough to bet on two food-tastic nights with my friends.    Monta Ramen is the real deal! So amazing is the Kuro (tonkatsu with black garlic oil) that you will definitely want to add a Kenadama (extra noodles) to help you get as much of that magical elixir that is perfect after a night out partying or before a night out. The broth is creamy and smooth and made with great effect to give it surprising \"I can't stop eating\" umami flavor. I would have loved it if the noodles which should almost always be the star of the ramen experience were slightly larger but so strong was the broth's performance that I didn't care.  The other great thing about this place is that this bowl only cost about $8 at the time that I am writing this. Add a 5 spice cured soft boiled egg for even more creamy richness.  Thanks Monta Ramen - Domo Arigato! *bow low*",

    "text": "Our last day in Vegas, Wifey wanted something different from The Strip and away from The Strip.   I was in the mood for some good Mexican, but I was overruled as Wifey wanted Ramen. I scoffed at the notion of a good Ramen joint existing in Vegas. I crave for good Ramen, and so far the best I've had to date was from Santouka Ramen in LA. The Ramen joints in The City are a joke, but thank god for San Mateo as my only salvation for good Ramen.   So when Wifey found this place, I was very skeptical; but I had no choice since she won all the money in Vegas that pretty much paid for our trip and then some.   So we drove to Vegas' Chinatown district and one thing I noticed is that the blocks are like a frigging mile long. Damn...the blocks are so far apart I felt like I was in the desert.   So we arrived and it's in a small strip mall similar to those found all over California (looks promising) and definitely qualifies as a Hole-In-The-Wall joint. The place is small...more tiny than small with a seating of about 20 + at a time. It was around lunch and the place was packed. I also observed a squad car illegally parked and had me worried for a second thinking it was a crime-ridden area and had an incident in progress. My guard subsided when I saw two of Vegas' finest slurping the Ramen inside.   We waited for approximately 20-25 minutes before we got called and I was famished. I was already eyeing the 'Daily Special\" board of Kuro Ramen and Spicy Tonkutso Ramen (both $7.95). Sold! Wifey also ordered a side of Tonkutso Pork over a bowl of rice.   The side order arrived first and what we got was a pile of pork meat on top of rice topped with Nori strips. Ummmm....Anthony Bourdain would approve of this.   Then our Ramen arrived and all my skepticism disappeared and what I felt next was envy. I was envious that Vegas can have a better Ramen joint than San Francisco. Then envy turned into sadness, which turned into me slurping the noodles to comfort my emotional needs at that time.   The broth was amazing. Unlike the broths in The City that are overly salty, this one was creamy, thick, rich but also tasted light. How could that be? It wasn't rich, thick and heavy as one would expect. All I can say is wow. It truly made a believer out of me. I also tasted the Wifey's broth and the roller coaster of emotion began again.   This one really surprised me in a good way.",

You're not going to find anything else in comaprison on The Strip anyways. (Thanks fellow Yelpers for the recommendations too!)  It was already packed on a Monday night around 7pm but the wait did die down around 7:30pm. It's a very small restaurant with 5 or so tables plus seating along the L-shaped counter area.   Since I'm a fan of thick chewy noodles, I ordered the Shoyu Ramen. The only other ramen with thick wavy noodes was the Miso Ramen. The Tonkatsu and tonkatsu shoyu came with thin noodles. Basic toppings include two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and green onions.   We also split the Kimchi friend rice but you can pass on this. It was so-so in my opinion. The ramen, however, hit the spot. The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were perfect! Who knew we would find such a great ramen place in Las Vegas in the Chinatown area.",

I am a big fan and there's a real science about making that perfect bowl of ramen. The broth is essentially 70% of the main ingredients that either can make or break a bowl of ramen.  Monta is well-known for their pork and chicken broth or the combination of the two. Had the tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles in pork broth included two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, green onions and an addition of nitamago (marinated soft boiled egg).  The ramen was really delicious. Even our Japanese colleagues thought the ramen was pretty good being in the US.  This place is not very big so it can get rather crowded so expect to wait during lunch hours.",

My friends have gutter palates & they're not adventurous @ all.  Fortunately, I have made new friends & that was how I ended up here. Thanks to Cresta I., I finally got to try Monta. I had accompanied her on a Mommy & me day. I, being the, me in the equation :P  We arrived a little before 6 pm on a Tuesday. We had actually tried to come around lunch time, which was silly of us, because it was way too packed. However, when we returned, it was less crowded & we were seated immediately at the counter.   I ordered the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen with Nitamago & some chicken fried rice. The rice came out first & it was really good. Then, the moment I had been waiting for, and cue the angels...AHHHH...my ramen. It just looked so beautiful & smelled wonderful. As I write this now, my mouth is watering & I can just taste it. It really was so comforting & delicious, the epitome of Umami, in the general sense. I just wanted to dive in and backstroke in there! I was totally reminded of the movie Ramen Girl, and I could just feel the love, and heart & soul that went into this bowl of ramen. Unfortunately, I have nothing else to compare it to. I have been to Japan, but sadly I never had the pleasure of having ramen while I was there :(  Overall, I really love this place & I will definitely be back. The staff is wonderful & gracious. It was a lot of fun sitting @ the counter & watching the cooking going on back there. Lol, I did find it amusing to see some of my fellow Hispanics back there doing big things ;) I'm pretty sure they were trying to pass them off as Japanese by tying their headbands a little tighter than normal though. Well, they do it @ Benihana, so why not here. Ha Ha! I will totally recommend this place to any and everyone who will listen.",

The only time I haven't had to wait more than half an hour was coming on a weekday after 8pm, but I like to come during the day because it makes for amazing hangover lunch. From experience, either the morning batch tastes better or the ramen tastes better after a night out.  The ramen is cheaper than any place I've been to. My favorite is the kuro (black) ramen which is fried garlic with tonkotsu ($7.99) The regular tonkotsu ($6.99) is good too. Toppings aren't expensive either. I always add a soft boiled egg ($1). I like to get the mentaiko bowl and eat whatever rice is leftover with my remaining broth.  There's a wait for a reason and it's well worth it.",

Lol we also got the fried dumplings.. (Gyzo)? I forgot, but it tastes like any other friend dumplings I had.. I don't think it's anything special... Specially for that price.. Nope..   All in all, glad I got to try it.. Two bowls and one dumpling order came out to be $40 including tip and all add-on's in our ramen.. If you're ever in town.. Give it a try!

    "text": "I'm not sure what the hype is all about at Monta Ramen.  Don't get me wrong, this place has good Ramen but I've definitely had better elsewhere.  I ordered the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen with nori and corn.  Personally my broth was a little bit on the salty side and my best friend felt the same way.  We also ordered gyoza, which I liked very much but that's about it.  We did arrive about 12:30 A.M. and I'm assuming we got the last batch since all the workers seemed to be cleaning up the place as we finished up our Ramen.  They also forgot to give us the red ginger you usually get on the side.  My boyfriend and I didn't realize this until we headed out the door after seeing the Ramen add-ons were compiled together at the bar ready to be stored for the next business day.  If you plan to go maybe try and go during normal/peak hours.  The way I see it, it's like ordering french fries in the wee hours of the night, when they are usually sitting out too long and become stale and soggy.  Basically, you might not get the best batch of broth...   Yeah, sorry Monta Ramen, there's just no chemistry between you and me.  Good try though.  Lina Chen",

It definitely has similar quality of ramen compared to many of the other places that I frequent in LA and SF. I ordered the basic staple of Tonkatsu ramen. The broth was very good, not too greasy or salty, but a great combination of pork flavors. The noodles were also well cooked, not too soft or al dente. Then comes the best part, the large pork pieces that are placed in the ramen. They are thinly sliced with a portion of fat that just makes it taste so good. I always want more, and often do order extra pork for my ramen, since they usually only give you about 2-3 pieces and after you have them, you want more. The ramen also comes with some other ingredients and if you start adding some extra ingredients, the cost of your bowl of ramen will add up (including a soft-boiled egg, extra noodles, some vegetables, and more). Overall, this is a quality ramen joint that I will definitely go back to again.",

The chashu was delish, practically melted in our mouths and the broth was super tasty. Their service was very nice and friendly unlike Ippudo in NYC which claims to have the best ramen noodles.  Personally, I don't think they deserve a 1 minute wait, never mind the craziness of 2 hours - and rude on top of that.  I can only hope that Monta opens up a spot in NYC.  If you even remotely like ramen - you have to go there when you are in Las Vegas.",

It gets packed, so expect to wait, especially if you are more than two diners. On a warm Vegas night, you can't go wrong with some cold noodles and an ice cold Japanese beer. The gyoza is also pretty delicious and comes out exactly as pictured in the menu...every time! One of my favorite things about this place is the spicy horse radish mustard that comes on the side. It is made in house and unreal. Was not a fan of the pork belly bowl, a little too fatty and more rice than anything, but it looks like a crowd pleaser. They also have some typical Japanese canned beverages. Place is super clean, kitchen is open for all to see, and service is both prompt and courteous.",

I don't know why the bad reviews on the gyoza, because it's right up my alley.  And yes, they do use different noodles for the Tonkotsu ramen versus the others.  The tonkotsu ramen is Hakata style, and is known for the very thin, very delicious noodles.  They cook theirs a little more here than they do in Hakata, but it's still great. Anyway, having tried the miso ramen, I'd say give this one a shot too.  It's their tonkotsu soup with miso added to give it a rich nutty flavor that really sticks to your ribs. I also have to recommend the chahan (fried rice), it is super peppery and delicious.  Just the way I remember it from my highschool days in Japan. A second note.  Anything you don't like on your ramen, let them know.  I keep going with picky eaters (1 vegan, others just picky), and they've made a vegan kimchi chahan, as well as bowls of ramen with extra this, no that, whatever you ask for. As always, they're eager to please, and definitely worth seeing, so help Monta stay busy, and maybe even expand.  I would love to see more of these guys.",

It's the best chashu I've had!  If people want a less salty broth, then I would suggest trying the shoyu ramen or the combo (tonkotsu shoyu).  Btw, it's tonkOtsu not tonkAtsu. Tonkatsu is breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. Get it straight people!",

We had the shoyu (chicken based) ramen with thicker noodles and the shoyu tonkatsu (blend of the shoyu chicken broth and the creamy pork tonkatsu broth). We didn't add extra toppings, and while they might have been nice, they were unnecessary. But bowls were brought quickly and consumed in near silence. The food was so good angels might have passed over our table. I loved the chewiness of the thicker noodles, but my lunch companion thought his thinner noodles were also good, though less chewy and not of a traditional soup noodle than the chewy egg based and thicker ramen noodles that I love. The waitress even checked in to see how our food was. Great service. I have nothing bad to say about this place. If I'm ever in Vegas again, I will make an effort to stop by this restaurant.",

This place is popular with both locals and tourists (in my case, I am simply an out of towner).   Although not nearly as amazing as Shinsengumi or Daikokuya in my hometown of LA, Monta is a great alternative if you find yourself hankering for a satisfying bowl of ramen after a long drive to Vegas. I opted for a classic bowl of ramen with slices of pork char siu, and it totally hit the spot for me.   If you ever decide to skip out on the numerous fast food chains in Barstow, be sure to pay Monta Noodle House a visit. You'd be glad you did!",

The noodles and pork were fantastic.  The broth was also incredibly flavorful with a smoother, milder taste.  I tried the tonkatsu broth too which is equally wonderful but in a more milky, slightly heavier way.  The gyoza was also great especially paired with some of the sauces.  This was definitely one of the best things I have eaten in a long time.  The fact that I was hungover and had spent the morning in the desert only added to the greatness.  The place had a very nice, and subtle ambiance.  The place was clean, the decorations were very simple but had personality and the place drew a nice crowd that was more than just the tourists that clog the Strip.  The wait staff was also incredibly helpful, efficient, and friendly.  I liked that when my table ordered the gyoza they said it would be ready in seven minutes.  Now that's service!  Oh, and they have A/C now. so your desert heat fears can be alleviated.  If you're in Vegas and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip and also want some great Ramen this is the place to go.  I definitely recommend going.  Also, great hangover food.",

What better dish to eat than cold al dente ramen noodles mixed in with a tangy light yuzu soy sauce and crunchy toss-in's of fungus, cucumber, bean sprouts, egg, pop of mustard and of course, you can't forget the FATTY FATTY cha-shu!  Conclusion:  Monta Ramen cold noodles during summer time.  Monta Ramen hot noodles during the winter time.  FTW.",

We both ordered green tea hoping for a soothing, warm start to the meal. The waiter brought out two cans of cold green tea. We explained we were expecting hot tea and were told they don't have any hot tea. So we asked for water with lemon but were told they don't have lemon. I ended up ordering a diet coke and my wife stuck with plain water  Things went smoother from there.  I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with egg, nori, and mustard greens. It was good, salty.  My wife ordered the Tonkatsu shoyu ramen with egg and green onion. It was also good and less salty than mine.  I highly recommend getting the eggs. It was a great addition to both. Beyond that, choose what you like.  Overall, I preferred my wife's ramen and she preferred mine. We switched midway through though I was only halfway done and she'd finished two-thirds of hers. I got ripped off.  We also ordered kimchee and gyoza. The kimchee was good but nothing special. The gyoza never arrived. However, the kimchee and ramen were plenty, so we didn't make a big deal of it. (I did check the receipt and verified we weren't charged for the gyoza.)  Great place for a rainy day, some of the best ramen I've ever had.",

I've been back at least 4-5 times in a month.  Since my first time, nothing about the food has changed but there have been some additions to the menu such as the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen and the Cold noodles (which I have yet to try). The food is still the same and I STILL LOVE IT.  The only thing that's changed is the prices for toppings and such has gone up a little bit and now my meal averages to about $12-$14 a trip for just one bowl. A little bit pricey sometimes but hey, you get what you pay for!  My old review still holds truth! GO FORTH AND EAT MONTA!",

Service was so-so, but goes well with a small shabby place such as Monta. Shabby, but CLEAN. It reminded me very well of the corner noodles houses they have in Japan. Stepping into Monta reminded me of the times I stayed in Japan during hot summers and cold autumns.   I ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen. Dericious aromatic smell, and served hot. I could say I enjoyed every bite and every piece of pork in this ramen! (Mind you, I am not a pork fan.) I believe Monta deserves a first-timers graced visit, so check em out! :)",

    "text": "Ordered the tonkatsu and the shoyu Ramen. Well, this is a place u either extremely love it or hate it never coming back. The tonkatsu soup base is way too salty, as almost the chef dumped the entire jaw in the salt.Its very very creamy and thick. It's how Japanese noodle base should be like.  And it has a very strong taste of the pork fat. Many might love the thickness, but I am not a pork fan, so is a no for me. Shoyu base is just chicken soup with soy sauce, just soso. Neither the thick wavy noodle or the thin noodle did the magic for me. I don't think I'm coming back, it's a good noodle place, just not for me.",

    "text": "My Monta review has been delayed to its full capacity. Monta I say is easily the best ramen spot in my opinion. I was super addicted to this stuff at one point, shoyu ramen with corn and butter with a sh*t ton of spicy powder on top. Stuff is crack. I am even surprised how I used to be able to finish a whole bowl with extra chashu even! no soup leftover to the last drop! Why am I missing a star? I guess consistensy is questionable in recent times. There are some days where the broth is a bit in the salty or bland side, some days where the noodles are a bit undercooked. Either days, I would still pick Monta over any other ramen place (I've been to 5 other) in town, that's it!",

So I arrange to pick up Wifee from work on a pretence of tile shopping for the new kitchen , quick detour and we're at Monta.   I get the Miso Ramen, fab broth with huge pieces of pork and big fat noodles. Wifee got the Shoyu, it was simply splendid. Washed down with some Green Tea (in a can) and we were out the door for less than $20 before a tip.  It's a tiny place with super friendly staff, food is cooked right in front of you. Really good.",
