Turns out her husband is the chef! Bravo! Beef jerky was authentic, fried tofu crunchy and hot, Rad Nar was fresh, and Nam Tok was outstanding. This is a new place (opened for only 6 weeks ) and we wish them well. We will be back next time we are in town.",

Waitress asked if I had been there before to understand there spice level and since I had read reviews I was confident with medium spice. About 5 bites in the spice kicked in ( I love spicy and it was but not so much that it ruined the food) I loved the broth perfectly sweet and sour with a nice amount of mushrooms and nice plump shrimp.",

I would most definitely order from here again. I only wish it had been a little bigger, so I could eat more...",

We did run into the standard problem every Asian restaurant is that they never give you enough rice. And given how cheap and easy it is to make, you would think that  Asian restaurants would pass out rice like Mexican restaurants pass out tortilla chips. So the food was good and the prices were good too. I think we each payed $15 between the two of us for the meal. I would not mind revisiting this place next time I am in town.",

The waitress warned me but I figured that I could handle it.   Beef Pad Thai is phenomenal - again I was warned about spicy and said 5 out of 10.  It made the mouth numb. Re-ordered chicken yom kae but this time zero out of 10 on the spicy chart and really liked it. Wife got beef Pho 5 out of 10 and she added chili sauce but she likes it hot.  \"THATS WHAT SHE SAID!\"  Got a cold Thai green tea and it's very helpful with the face melting.",

Other than their food, they have a pink milk tea that can be quite addicting. Atmosphere is quiet yet inviting. There is always someone that greets you at the door as you walk in.   The one thing I wish they had was papaya salad laos style. They're the first Thai restaurant that I've tried in Las Vegas that doesn't have it on their menu. Other than that, everything is delicious. Love love their chicken pad Thai and Thai fried rice!",

This is close to Warm Spring and Bermuda. It's in the shell gas station plaza. Their interior was very authentic and their food was amazing. The server warned us that their food is little bit more spicier than other thai restaurant, so we got spicy level 2 pad thai and spicy level 1 curry. Pad thai and curry were all so amazing, but pad thai was little spicy. But the curry was the best curry I had in a long time.  The servers were all kind and had smiles on their faces which made us feel very welcome and comfortable. I would definitely go back to this place and recommend here to others!!",

    "text": "I judge Thai restaurants by two things: Thom Kha soup and curry.  Both of these are coconut milk based, and can reveal a lot about a place.  It's easy to cut corners and water down recipes to save a few bucks (coconut milk is pricey, after all).  The good places will have rich, strong flavors in a thick and creamy coconut base.  On the other side of the spectrum, you'll find watery soup and bland curry.  You may have different criteria if you like seafood, or certain specialty dishes... but these two things have always been a very good barometer for me.  I'm very pleased to say that I Am Thai Cuisine exceeded my expectations!  The soup was delicious with large slices of intense ginger, chunks of lemongrass, and whole kaffir lime leaves.  Even more importantly, they didn't skimp on the protein (chicken, in this case).  I also like to see how they handle custom orders, so I requested the yellow curry lunch special without potatoes.  The server offered to substitute other veggies like broccoli and carrots... it was a nice touch, and showed their flexibility and desire to please their customers.  The curry was delicious and full of flavor, just how it should be.  Speaking of service, that's a key component of any good restaurant, and the staff here is great.  Fast, attentive, and very friendly.  I don't usually make a beeline from the airport to a restaurant, but in this case, it's well deserved.  This is definitely my regular Thai spot in LV!",

I love Thai food so when I came upon the reviews for Thai Kitchen, it looked so tempting.  I took an Uber (5 min from airport) and looked over the menu again.  I instantly gravitated to the fried red snapper with an apple slaw over it.  The waitress attempted to tell me everything was family style.  I let her know that I was hungry and it would be no problem.  The host and hostess was so cordial. Always paying attention to what I might want or need.  Well, when the fish came, it took less than 10 min to demolish that.  The outside of fish was crunchy yet the inside so moist.  The apple slaw with its sweet, yet savory back end complemented it so well.  Everything was gone (except the head) and I let them know that the chef did an awesome job on the fish.  It's a little hole in the wall with a great ambience. I'd make sure when I get in town that this will definitely be a go to each time.  Aloha 'Oi.",

The place is quite specious and the tables are not all clustered.  The menu is affordable and simple.  And the food was delicious.  Some times Thai can be greasy or oily bit here it was perfect. The sweet and savory combination nations of the curry and chicken and vegetable made all the difference. I'm not a frequent LV visitor but will come back and hit this spot again!",

The waitress was polite and prompt as well. Caution: when choosing a spice level go down a notch from what you think you can handle! The only negative that wasn't really a negative is that the bill was written out in Thai so we were unable to figure out who ordered what when it was time to pay. We solved that problem by just splitting the bill in two. We'll definitely be back!",

We half-seriously joked that we would drive out here regularly from California just to eat here.   We had curry chicken, pad see eiw (x4 - huge hit w our kids - excellent  w/o egg and no soy sauce for allergies), pineapple curry. I loved the papaya salad too.   Highly recommend!",

I work about a 3 minute drive away and my boss recommended that my boyfriend and I try this place; since we're always looking for the next best. We consider ourselves spicy food aficionados.. and let me tell you - I Am Thai does NOT disappoint!! Not only is their food authentic, but the spicy levels are killer! Disclaimer - I've never sat down to eat since I'm always grabbing food to take home after work, but the ambiance is so nice and serene every time I walk in. The ladies at the counter know me by name and face and my order before I even tell them (I 'm a creature of habit) Vegan Friendly! My boyfriend is vegetarian and we never have difficulty finding new menu items for him. The fried tofu Pad Thai is his favorite - Spicy level 7! I stay around a 4/5 and enjoy their shrimp thai fried rice. Seafood is fresh, tofu is fresh, rice, noodles, veggies, everything! We love this place! 10/10 Spicy level and Satisfaction level!",

I got the red curry and she got paid thai. The lunch portions are pretty generous for the low cost! Great for a student on a budget like me lol.  My friend enjoyed her dish very much. Seemed like your typical pad thai dish.  My red curry was tasty as well and had lots of veggies. However, I was kind of bummed because I tried to order a spice level 8 & the server would not let me. He said some people in the last week had sent back 4's and 5's for being too hot. I thought to myself \"wow, they must make their food really spicy here.\" So I settled for a 6 as he suggested, and it was not spicy at all -__- I had to dump in several spoons of chili paste to get any sort of kick. I appreciate him trying to watch out for me to not get something too spicy... but ya girl can handle the heat! I was almost offended that he doubted me so much LOL. At least I know next time to take it up a notch so that I can hopefully have a 5-star experience.",

Barbecue Thai chicken was very good as well and full of flavor. It really didn't need the spicy sweet chili sauce that was served on the side. Ginger chicken was also very good.

We were able to feed 4 people with 4 plates plus rice and sauces. This restaurant sure has a kick to heat the mouthes of all spice lovers. If you are looking for something with not as much heat, be sure to get the mild. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I prefer Thai sauces to be a bit thicker. Unfortunately the sauces here were a bit runny, but the bursts of flavor make up for it.",

Whoever's in the kitchen should be made chef of the universe. Seriously, it's that good.  There was a ok-ish thai restaurant in this location previously, but don't think they've just changed signs and started back up under a new name. It's totally different and so, so much better.  The beef jerky is my favorite. It's lean (fat on meat is my nemesis and they take care to only use the best cuts) and incredibly flavorful.  I also love the beef Larb (Laab) at about level 6. Hot but not blow your head off heat. LOL, they're totally going to know who I am just by what food I reviewed. It's practically all I order!  Please help keep this business alive. My tastebuds will really weep if this place doesn't outlive me!",

I saw this spot and was actually craving Thai so I decided to try it.   As soon as I walk in I was greeted by a woman and she seated me right away. I was the only customer in there but then I noticed two gentlemen across the room eating as well. The woman was very polite and got my drink and food order right in. I had ordered beef pad Thai level 6 spice. I had ordered a soda and I drank the first glass pretty fast because come on, it's 100 degrees outside now so I was pretty thirsty haha! The woman saw my glass becoming empty and she refilled it right away.   My pad Thai was brought out in short time and it was delicious. Portion was decent and I really enjoyed my lunch. What really made me want to do a review was because my drink was half empty and one of the gentlemen I saw eating across the room, looked over at me, got up and walked over to me and asked how everything was and if he can get me another refill. I was stunned. This man was on his lunch break probably and decided to do this nice gesture. And really I didn't mind waiting for the woman to come back later or anything.   Customer service was excellent, I was checked up on more than enough, and food is delicious. I will definitely go back.",

Then this morning I am...diarrhea. And it wasn't from the bacon and eggs I ate yesterday, it had to be the Tom Kha. So pass on this place. The food is mediocre (if you want the BEST tom kha go to Pon Ocha, it's so far from my home but I'd drive there and back all day over this place) and I got a small case of food poisoning. :/ Case closed.",

Both the greeter and waitress were awesome!  Explaining to the waitress about the allergies, she wrote everything down so as to relay to the chef.  She made sure we all had plenty of water, with cold icy carafes on the table.  Our group ordered Veggie Pad Thai, Chicken Pad Thai, Veggie Fried rice, Veggie Lo Mein, Seafood Lo Mein, BBQ Chicken and rice, Mongolian Beef and Tom Kha.  EVERTHING was delicious.  Cooked perfectly.   I had the Tom Kha and have to say it was so yummy. The flavors were right on spot.   Shared at the end was a beautiful presentation of Mango Sticky Rice. Again - just right on spot and a perfect way to end the meal.   This will be a go back to for Thai.  I haven't had Thai this good in 6 years.  Something to consider - this restaurant doesn't use Thai chili powder or paste - they use fresh Thai pepper - it's HOT.  So when the waitress says their 5 is a 10 at other restaurants - believe her.  They will bring fresh Thai chili to the table if you need.  I had a 4 and it was plenty.",

There was a little miscommunication on one of the items. I ordered the fish with apple salad. From others previous posts I thought I would be getting a whole fried snapper but I received fish fillets instead. Despite being a disappointed in. It getting what I thought I would, the fish filets were cooked well and the portion was generous. The salad on top was fresh and seasoned well. I just really wanted the whole fried fish. So make sure to specify!   Thai tea was a little too milky and we asked for a bit more of the tea it self to make it stronger which they were happy to accommodate.  I, myself am not a fan of Las Vegas tap water. So get bottled or order a drink!   Enjoy!",

I switched the scallops for shrimp and they included crab, I thought I'd died and gone to Thai food heaven! All the meats, we got shrimp chu chee, pork panang, chicken Tom yum, and shrimp spring rolls were fabulous and not over cooked, which is a peeve of mine. I loved how the curries came with rice, lots of places charge for rice and the delivery was so easy, on time and the driver was so sweet. My only feedback is the the spring rolls were quite small, like two bites per roll. The sauce for them was awesome, just used to a more filled roll. All in all I'll dream of this place until I return again!",

They offer many levels of spicy and I opted for the mild which wasn't very spicy at all.  It was a decent sized portion.  The service here seemed kind of mom and pop and was extremely slow.  For being half empty, waiting 15 minutes for 2 noodle dishes is pretty bad.  They also have a free green thai tea if you have a yelp check in! I asked for just the green tea part which the waitress seemed to understand, but I was still gifted with the green thai tea free of charge.  I tasted it and and expected it was super sweet and i didn't touch it after that.  We were killing time waiting to pick someone up at the airport but I probably won't be coming back.",

Walked in, got seated and was legged waiting for over 15 minutes without anyone coming to check on us. Not even water. It wasn't even busy either.   We were so hungry and after no one approaching us after a long wait we walked out... they didn't even see us leave since they were busy doing other things.

If you want a nice sit down Thai restaurant look no further.   The server was good about warning us about their above normal spice levels. I ordered a two(usually order a five out of ten) and it was perfect.   My lady ordered the pad Thai and it was perfect. I was going to ask for a lime since it was missing but the flavor was there.   The sticky rice and mango was slightly below par. The mango had seen better days but the presentation was nice. One rice chunk was in the shape of a heart, the other in the shape of a star.

I am used to having green beans etc in it and to me it was more like regular curry. The spice level on my curry was perfect but the rest of my families was way over spiced considering I ordered it light spice.  The containers/ serving sizes were in the smaller side but was enough.

The outside of the place does it absolutely no justice. I almost didn't come in. It's in a strip mall, dark exterior, nothing bright or welcoming about it. I'm so glad I took the chance and came inside. The food and service are both exceptional. If I could give it eight stars instead of five, I would. Word of warning!

Regardless, we chose to come here due to the great reviews and we were not disappointed with the food or service.  Service was great. The servers were all friendly and promptly fulfilled our requests.  Food--the food came out in a timely manner and was all really delicious. We ordered: pad thai, pad see ew, pineapple fried rice, yellow curry, green curry fried rice, massaman curry, and spicy basil chicken.

    "text": "FABULOUS!!! We just ate dinner at I am Thai tonight and all of us loved it. While visiting Las Vegas for vacation, I decided to go to a Thai restaurant off the strip (Thai food is my favorite type of food-see other reviews by me). I chose this place because it had very good reviews and it certainly did not disappoint. Not only was the food very delicious, but what made it so great was the extremely friendly staff. It was a True pleasure to eat there because they were so nice. It was seven of us so we ordered a good amount of food. The waitress was very nice and honest when we asked if what we ordered was enough food. It wasn't an insane amount of food for seven but I thought it was just right. The portions are quite large so even though we did not order seven full entrees, it was enough. We ordered two small soups, tom yum shrimp and tom kha chicken. We also got papaya salad and thai dumplings as appetizers. For our main meal we got tofu pad thai (a choice of fried or steam tofu-I chose fried), chicken pad thai, pineapple fried rice (which is served in a pineapple!), and massaman curry with shrimp. For dessert we got fried banana with coconut ice cream. Everything was very very very delicious (see pictures for large portions and beautiful plating!) I would definitely recommend going here, if you are a tourist or a local. It is a great place with delicious food, friendly and inviting staff, and low prices.",

I came to work and mentioned to my co-worker how bad it was.  She said she ate there too and it was bland also.  How can you ruin Thai food? I don't understand it. I can make it better. The price was high too. My dish was almost $13.00. The same dish at another Thai place l love is $6.95 lunch, $8.95 dinner. My co-workers was $15.00 for herself. I hope they improve because they are very nice, the restaurant is clean and well decorated. More flavor and sauce is what they need and lower the prices.",

Again we rang the bell after a minute or so.  And a third time.  Finally, frustrated and about to leave, I just continually rang the bell until someone came out from the kitchen.   I'm sure it's loud back there and they didn't hear.  But still,  for any restaurant, that's going to lose you customers.    Once we were greeted by someone the service was fantastic.  We ordered Thai Iced Teas which were both free since we checked in on FB and Yelp.  We enjoyed those while we perused the menu, which looked amazing.  We ordered Pad Thai for the kids, my wife ordered the Pad See Ew, and I got the Pad Kee Mao.  The kid's Pad Thai arrived first and we all sampled it:  hot, flavorful and delicious!    My noodles came next, delicious flavor, but for some reason, not hot...  Lukewarm.  Not outright cold but definitely not fresh off the wok.  Like maybe my plate had sat there for a few minutes prior to them bringing it out.  My wife's noodles were hot, though, and temperature aside, the flavor was excellent and I imagine if my noodles had been hot I would be writing a 5 star review right now, despite the hang-up at the entrance.  Sadly,  I can only honestly give this place 4 stars with the caveat that this was probably just a one-off issue that doesn't happen often.  We WILL be back and I hope to have a more seamless experience next time.  They've only been open a week and are probably still working some kinks out of their system.  Great food and people.  Definitely worth checking out.  Room for improvement, but I'm sure this will be a place we come to regularly.",

    "text": "My husband and I have found our thai restaurant of choice when visiting Las Vegas. We dined at I Am Thai twice in two days and loved everything that we tried.   It was my dad's birthday and I was in search of a restaurant that could accommodate 24 people with one day notice. After contacting various restaurants, Joey of I Am Thai was the most responsive and helpful. He allowed us to create our own customized menus and provided exceptional pricing. We interacted via telephone call and text to make sure we were on the same page. I truly appreciate the time and help that was provided...  I Am Thai has your typical thai menu items; however, the authenticity and flavor of their dishes sets them aside. I'm talking about a whole other level. A few favorites are their crab fried rice, pineapple fried rice and pad thai.  Crab Fried Rice:  This was my favorite dish. Unlike other restaurants that use imitation crab, I Am Thai stuffs their fried rice with real crab chunks. They are not greedy with their crab either; there is a good amount inside the dish. The price is very reasonable considering the size of the dish and the real crab that they use. Delicious!!  Pineapple Fried Rice:  The presentation of this dish is already a plus. There is fried rice served inside of a full size pineapple (the remaining fried rice that didn't fit inside is served on side of pineapple). This fried rice was flavorful and sweet. It's like the juices of the pineapple penetrate into the fried rice. It's more on the sweeter end, but was a hit. You can definitely taste the pineapple flavor  Pad Thai: Perfectly cooked pad thai! We tried with chicken and another time with shrimp. I Am Thai is not greedy with their protein...they provide a very generous amount of meat (or tofu) of choice. We ordered a spice level of 3 and it was perfect for my taste buds. The spice was more than mild, but still manageable to eat for me (I can't handle too much spice without my nose running and lips burning).   Everyone enjoyed their meals and continued raving about the goodness of the crab and pineapple fried rice dishes (half favored the crab better and the other half favored the pineapple). Along with the excellent food, the customer service at I Am Thai is top notch. A+ all around...every employee that we interacted with was very pleasant and helpful!   We'll be back for sure!! Thank you again Joey and I Am Thai for a memorable bday luncheon for my dad!!",

    "text": "We ordered the following for take out:  Pineapple curry- very delicious. Would eat again. Panang curry- the portion was very small and it was very spicy. Pad see ew- better than the pad thai but the noodles were very dry. I don't know if they sat for a while or what.  Pad thai- also super dry and almost a little too sweet.  I've had the two noodle dishes at other places before and while I know that they're not supposed to be super saucy I do expect a light coating of sauce on the noodles. These were bone dry. When we got there to pick up our order was ready except for the panang curry so maybe while they waited for that the noodles got dry.   Another thing I didn't like was that they give regular steamed white rice instead of jasmine rice with the curry dishes. That was kind of a let down.   I would definitely try them again though. I'm sure they're much better when you dine in.",

So they set the tables as people come in which is kind of weird since they don't have that many tables (the place is pretty big). The food was bland. Egg rolls were tasteless. Tom yum soup was weird. Lots of tomatoes and mushroom, on the sweet side, definitely not traditional Tom yum broth. Didn't care for it. The pad see yew was tasteless. Fried rice was good but that is kind of hard to mess up. We waited 30 minutes for our entrees. I really don't understand how this is a 5 star rated place. Much better Thai options in the valley.",

My daughter couldnt really tolerate it, but they went ahead and fixed the spiciness to a tolerable taste, more mild. Which I greatly appreciate them doing for us! And when we left, one of the ladies gave both my kids little toys to take home! I would reccomend this place to everyone. They had great taste, atmosphere, and customer services!

Pineapple fried rice was tasty and actually came out in a pineapple shell.  Wish the spring roll order was larger for the price (presentation almost made up for size). Silver noodle dish came out way too salty so we sent it back - returned much better and glad staff was accommodating.  Last trip, the mango sticky rice dessert was sweet and a fave of our toddler.",

Also, it was really funny because I wanted the spiciest possible they had and the server looked really worried and said \"were a lot spicier than most Thai food places out here.\" But as it turns out - they're still nowhere near as spicy as go sy thai's \"top of the line\" back at home. Lol.   They really took care of us though. So I was satisfied with everything. Definitely check this place out.",

It wasn't too busy when we arrived so we were seated immediately and was able to order after a quick scan of the menu.  We ordered: Large Tom Yum Soup, salmon with Thai chili sauce, pad see ew with tofu, cashew but chicken, papaya salad mild, panang with Tofu, and Thai style fried rice with shrimp.  The soup was nice and sour and the shrimp was large. It was served in a bow and not one of those flaming hot pots. I think they made it with too much fish sauce. The Thai fried rice was good but was slightly sweet (it would taste better with more lime), the panang with tofu had good consistency but was way too sweet, the salmon was fried so it was kinda dry and the sauce it came with too spicy (I'm glad I order the sauce on the side), the pad see ew was ok too but also made slightly too sweet. I think my husband liked the papaya salad but he's not a picky eater, and the cashew nut chicken was also just ok and since it was made with pineapple the sweetness was expected. The yelp check in Thai iced tea was overly sweet. I couldn't finish it and was glad they had water already poured for us. Overall this place was ok. It's not great but not horribly bad either. The service was prompt and friendly. But I felt that for the portions (which was on the smaller side) a bit expensive. Total bill came out to $115 with tip included.",

Our go to favorites from this establishments are typically Yam Woon Sen, Spicy Catfish, Roasted Duck Curry and their generous portion of Tom Yum Soup. Most of our experience consists of take out, but our orders were always timely and correct and staff always courteous. I always end up with left overs due to their generous portion sizes and I am very much okay with that. From the dishes I mentioned above I cannot say that I have a single complaint about any of them.

If you're returning your rental car to LAS, this is the place to be. It's literally right across the street from the rental car center AND next to the gas station. So fill her up and them fill yourself up before heading out on your flight.   You wouldn't expect this quality and authenticity in this location. It's just a pretty dead strip mall, but I Am Thai is clearly located in the corner of the lot. You're greeted by a huge set of double wooden doors. Once you walk in, it's huge inside and super spacious. I love that the tables aren't slammed right next to each other and there's enough person space between you and the next table.   The staff was super friendly, especially on Christmas Eve! The menu was extensive and they had a good amount of pictures there too. You can tell that this place was legit and the staff spoke Thai as well. There are specials but we opted for the classic pineapple fried rice and pad see ew.   Luckily for us, this fried rice didn't have raisins in it! It came packed into a pineapple with a great flavor and decent amount of shrimp, and the rice that didn't fit, it came on another plate. The pad see ew was super delicious! Noodles were soft and not hard, jump packed with flavor and a good portion of protein!    Two entrees was a lot of food even to share, and I eat a lot! Oh, best part, when do you a Yelp checkin, you get a free Thai iced tea and that portion was huge for a free drink! In fact, they even tell you that your thai tea is free if you check in on Yelp!   Overall, I was super impressed by the food quality and the portions. It was a great vibe inside and definitely one for the books in terms of Thai food in Las Vegas.",

Almost mo flavor in the curry other than heat..... what happened to the incredible flavor????  Don't know what level to order next time. Probably a 3 because although I like it spicy I don't want a 10.  Also last time there was more onions than chicken in my curry....  consistency is what keeps people coming back.  Get it right!",

Ultimate favorite is their glass noodle dish (sorry I don't know the Thai name) but it is fantastic!  Flavorful and fresh (though not sure if it's healthy- who cares?).  Their Panang beef is superb as well (another favorite).  I once ordered 6 dishes from here (phad Thai, assorted fried rice, basil chicken and I can't remember what else).  Everything was great.  Be careful though..mild spicy is actually medium to hot spicy...so don't be a hero!",

They aren't joking. At other Thai places I can eat a 7 or 8 no problem here I get like a 4 or 5. But the spice is great tasting and isn't just hot with no flavor. Eat here.

    "text": "Wow! I am so happy that we have a world class Thai restaurant on this side of town. When I entered I noticed a very clean room with a nice fountain providing  a soothing background. I was greeted with a smiling face and promptly seated.  I had the Thai dumplings and they were scrumptious.  There were 5 in the order and served in a beautiful white oval shaped serving bowl with a lettuce leaf lightly drizzled in a peanut sauce.  For my main course I had the combination red curry ordered at spice level 5.  There was two medium sized shrimp that were sweet and spicy.  The beef and chicken were very well prepared and served in a beautiful serving platter with a bowl of rice.  The curry was very well done with a slight burn on the lips.  I may try spice level 6 next time.  For a drink I had the jasmine tea served in a large clear glass cup which I thought was unique.  I have a lot of favorite Thai restaurants in town and this one ranks near the top of my list.  Bravo!",

They never seem to disappoint with the food, whether I eat there, pick it up, or with delivery.. which I've done all. Delivery was so nice since I didn't want to drive in the wind, and showed up faster then expected. My personal favorite is the chicken pad Thai, with a medium spice..but be warned they don't play when it comes to spice, just like I like it. My boyfriend like the Mongolian beef, plus those potstickers are bomb dignity. We tried the wonton soup since we're not felling then best and it was pretty damn good. Can't wait to try some other things.",

We ordered delivery for New Year's Day, we requested most dishes mild and medium spice and 1 dish spicy because this place usually makes things a little more spicy than normal. Fair warning, I love spice! I make everything spicy! But when we got the food, the medium was SPICY and the spicy I couldn't even eat, my mouth was in pain, I had to drink milk and my skin around my lips turned red and splotchy like koolaid mouth! It became a dare to try the red curry and watch people freak out. It was unbearable. I had a bunch of guests and luckily I have 4 bathrooms because every one of them was occupied! Something went wrong, something wasn't good or cooked right or something because everyone got ill!! I thought it was just the spice level, but the next day I ate the last remaining mild dish and within 30 min, I too was in the bathroom again. Not a great New Years celebration.",

After doing some retail therapy shopping, I got really hungry and I was long overdue for lunch. I had been craving Thai food for a few days now and it was perfect timing because I Am Thai Cuisine was right down the street from the mall. Tiki (Cute name for cute girl!) was the person who helped me with my to-go order! She was so welcoming when I came into the restaurant with her big smile and upbeat energy.! Then she handed me a menu. I told her I wanted a large size chicken Tom Yum soup that I've ordered before. The only difference is I told her to make it spicier to clear up my sinuses since I'm going through VERY SEVERE allergies right now. I ordered that soup, but I also wanted an entree. I couldn't decide if I wanted chicken fried rice or chicken Pad Se Ew. Tiki highly suggested that I get the Pad Se Ew. Typically I like adding heat to my Thai food, but she said the noodles are good by itself. She offered me a drink and I ordered water since I was so thirsty from all the shopping I did and it was hot outside since it is still summer here in Las Vegas. I wish I could have ordered Thai milk tea, but since I'm on antibiotics, my doctor said I can't have dairy. Therefore I had to settle for water to drink. My order was made quickly and she organized my to go food so neatly! Thank you so much Tiki for your hospitality!",

Both the owner and our server were extremely attentive to our wants and needs. It was my first time ever eating papaya salad and my first few bites were questionable but I ended up eating it all after I got used to the taste, it was delicious. The plate presentation is so pretty with orchids, banana leaf and butter lettuce helping in each presentation, we just kind of admired our plates before digging in. The restaurant is very spacious and clean. The location is a little inconspicuous with lots of parking and most important thing for me is their water tastes good, not like heavy chlorine. The taste of their dishes coupled with their reasonable prices warrants a definite return visit. Overall a solid five stars.",

    "text": "So amazing! The Thai coffee has no bitterness.  For our appetizer we had the Thai beef jerky which was delicious, tough but flavorful.    For our soup we had Tom Kha Kai, which is one of our favorite Thai soups, they didn't disappoint. The Tom Kha Kai was so creamy and the mushrooms fresh with just a hint of lemon grass!  We had two entrees, the panang curry with chicken and chicken spicy basil. The panang sauce  was creamy with large chunks of chicken. The spicy basil was delicious, something different was carrots and green beans which i felt like it made the dish more complete nutritionally. The chicken was minced instead of left as chunks which left a happy texture on the tongue.  I would say amazing all the way around.   The service was super nice and concerned about our experience.   Overall, a very good experience and comparable to our favorite place, lotus of siam. I wish they would add the crispy duck with thai basil sauce like lotus, then this place might be our favorite.",

I had Panang Curry, Tom Yum Soup w/ Shrimp, and beef jerky.  The curry was definitely flavorful, enough spice and sweetness to balance out the salt, goes great with rice. Tom Yum Soup was a little sourer than the ones I've had before, which I found to be surprisingly good.  Beef Jerky was something new and different to me, it was tender, a bit chewy, but not the kind of overcooked meat that only gets bigger in your mouth as you chew. Flavorful by itself, and with the sauce it comes with, even better!  Would definitely come back again just to try out other things.",

    "text": "Second Update:  just had another amazingly great dinner.  This place rocks.  It is arguably the best Thai food in Las Vegas.  And it has never been crowded any time we have been there.  It is a bit of a drive for us, but well worth the trip.  Update:  We had a wonderful experience.  They turned down the background music (at our request) which improved the ambience greatly.  We were a group of 8 and everyone was delighted with the food.  It is now one of my favorite Thai restaurants in LV.    Here is my original review posted shortly after the restaurant first opened:  We love Thai food and are always looking for new places.  Saw this one on Yelp and gave it a try.  The food was quite excellent.  I had vegetable soup and red curry.  Both were very tasty.  Be forewarned, \"medium\" really means \"spicy.\"  But really quite delicious.  My wife had Pad See Ewe (sp?) which she liked very much as well.  The service was also very good and the staff is quite friendly.  The prices are also very reasonable.  So, why not 5 stars? The elevator music was driving us nuts. It is pretty annoying.  The restaurant has only been open a few months so my hope is they'll fix it up a bit and maybe find some better music to play.",

There were also eggs and Chinese broccoli besides tofu. It was so good I had to order it again for a different day. For the second time, I got Pad See Eww with chicken and it was also good. The people at the front is very nice, food was quickly made and well packaged. Overall both times I've been there to get food to go were good experience. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because they charge you $1 extra if you're paying with cards instead of cash on orders under $15. I've never had to pay that ridiculous fee anywhere else. So if you're coming here, make sure you bring cash!!!",

It's in the corner of an unsuspecting strip mall and it was pretty slow inside (Thursday at 7pm) but that was not at all a testament to the food.  We had the Pad Kee Mao and the Cashew Chicken and both were excellent. Their spicy scale leans more toward spicy so even at a 3 it was a solid medium on the spicy scale, maybe even more spicy than medium so be careful.

I had the beef pad see ew and an order of their papaya salad. My papaya salad came out first and had the perfect level of heat. Tasted super fresh and had a great crunch. My pad see ew had beautiful char marks on the noodles and was so flavorful. The beef was tender and it was a generous portion for the cost.  Prices are on the lower end which was appreciated after the overpriced food from the Strip. I highly recommend I Am Thai for your Thai cravings!",

However, the pad thai was super bland. They don't do lemon or much veggies. The tamarind sauce had no flavor so I had to add my own lime and peanut to finish it off.",

    "text": "We were staying at Mandalay Bay and wanted Thai food. We saw there was Lemongrass at the Aria, but in all honesty, how I feel about glitz and glam when it comes to ethnic food, I was a bit turned off. I decided we could Uber off the strip to find some authentic cuisine.  When we opened the beautiful heavy doors, the entire restaurant was empty. It was a little after 8:30pm and it closes at 10, last call is at 9:30 and I was a bit scared of the lack of patrons.   We ordered three dishes, a yellow curry with chicken and bamboo shoots, spicy eggplant and fried tofu and pad thai. As I took my first sip of my Thai iced tea, my worries slowly went away. Our entrees arrived and each bite of every dish made me so proud of leaving the comforts of the Strip and explore local spots. All we kept saying to each other was, \"OMG, this is delicious.\" We ended our meal with fried pancake. Bomb dot com.   Service was impeccable and food was ON POINT. Total bill came to 54 dollars, including a 20 percent tip. Vegas. That's a winner.",

Nothing to worry if you are not thai cause staffs will explain you everything you want to know about each menu. We ordered papaya salad with grilled chicken and grapow pork. And finish the meal with fried banana with coconut icecream. Those are all awesome. We spent only 17 bucks each (for 2 people). Love this place. Recommended !!",

    "text": "My crew and I had just finished a hike down at the Gold Strike Hot Springs and another group of friends had wrapped up a day of climbing in Red Rock. We were all starving and decided to meet somewhere in the middle. It came down to either Ramen or Thai. We settled on Thai and more specifically on I Am Thai Cuisine (IATC). We were not disappointed.  IATC is pretty easy to find and parking was also easy. We were dropping in on a Sunday evening around 5PM and the place was kind of empty. As a result we were seated pretty much immediately. Server was attentive and friendly.  ProTip: On the time we ate there (12/16/2018) three of us used the Check-In offer for some delicious Thai Ice Tea. DO IT!  We ordered several items and ate them family style. Here's what we ordered and what we thought about it: Yellow Curry with Pork: This was great. The curry was sweet and not too spicy. The pork pieces were tasty and not overcooked. Definitely worth getting if you like curry. Panang Curry with Chicken: This was also delicious, but slightly more spicy than the Yellow curry. The group was kind of split down the middle on which was better. Personally I preferred the Yellow curry because it also had potatoes and carrots while the Panang was more just curry, green onions, and the meat. Both curry dishes came with a bowl of white rice. Crispy Pork with Chinese Broccoli (special request off menu): This was pretty tasty. The pork is fried to a crispy, salty, flavorful piece and tossed in with a leafy kind of veggie. I didn't even know about this, but one of us in the group knew to ask for it. Definitely ask for it. Tom Yum with Chicken: This soup was okay, broth was clear and watery but like many of the dishes it was spicy. Overall I could take it or leave it. Pad See Eiw with Pork: This was pretty good. The was plenty of noodles and ingredients. Can't say it was the best I've ever had, but it was certainly really good. Thai Fried Rice with Beef: This was pretty standard issue. Nothing stand out, but decent. You could probably pass on this unless you just needed a filler dish. Chicken over Fried Rice: The fried rice is identical to the Thai Fried Rice, but layered with a bunch of slices of fried chicken breast. The rice is okay and the chicken wasn't bad. Crispy and tender. Not really flavorful, but they included a sweet sauce. Fried Banana: This wasn't bad, but no need to go out of your way to get it. The bananas were wrapped up in a crepe like shell and deep fried then lightly drizzled in honey and powdered sugar. I also saw the menu had mango with sticky rice and next time I'll look to try that. Thai Ice Tea (Free on Yelp with check-in): Maybe it's me and my taste buds, but this was too sweet for me. I had to pour in some extra ice water to dilute the sugary flavor. Overall it's what you expect, but it tasted extra good after a long hike or day out climbing on the rock.  Yeah so overall I Am Thai Cuisine pleased everyone in the group. Definitely look to hit it up again if we're in the mood for Thai Food. Prices were reasonable and food quantity was fair. It's definitely bookmarked.",

(Pro Tip: If you're only a beginner in Thai cuisine and are scared to try anything but the Pad Thai, this would be a solid beginner's choice that will surprise the hell outta ya).  2. A curry that taste authentic. Another check mark! Their red curry is excellent. A must get.  3. Solid, cheap lunch specials. You get a soup, entree and a spring roll for less than $10? Count me in.   4. Nice, kind-hearted Thai people. Also check.   I love I Am Thai and definitely can say it's pretty close to Bangkok as I can get in Las Vegas. However, the Pad Thai is way too saucy.

I was excited there was a lunch menu but bummed it was pretty limited. I was in the mood for seafood, so I ordered a squid salad off the regular menu. I asked for no spicy sauce and the waiter asked me if I wanted the dish spicy (didn't I just say no sauce?). When the entree came it was still covered in sauce (a tad spicy) and the squid was super tough. I could barely eat it but I didn't really feel like sending it back since I was short on time. I should have known better than to order it when it was the only squid entree on the menu.  Coworker got the chicken and broccoli and he described it as tasting like an \"expensive TV dinner\".    Also they charge .50 for a credit card transaction and they require it be at least $15. Yikes.   Overall I was hoping for a better close-to-work lunch spot, but I left disappointed.",

    "text": "To me, this place does not live up to its rating. I've been here twice, months apart and unfortunately it was the same experience,  nothing special.  The only reason we stopped by again? Because we were in the area, looking for Thai and I had bookmarked this place, but forgot we'd already been and remembered as soon as we pulled up, the prior experience. We were too hungry to go somewhere else so we tried it again.  Both times we came after a lunch rush, about 1p. And both times, the restaurant was clearing out, but we had to wait for a table to be cleaned. I can't imagine what it would be like during the actual lunch rush because ALL the tables still had dirty dishes on them for a good  while. And a table only got cleaned when new customers came in. Nobody was manning the front desk this time, so a couple actually walked out tired of waiting to be seated? There were 2 servers/waitresses and 1 cook who kept coming out of the kitchen. I made a comment to our server that they must've been busy, and she said they were short one because they called in sick. Hmm was that the same reason last time too? The tables did eventually get cleared    Now for the food. I don't think this was authentic thai. The flavors of the lime, basil, fish sauce, palm sugar, Thai pepper, basil were not there at all. We've tried the Thai egg rolls, papaya salad, larb,  tofu basil , the basic dishes and I was not a fan, there are far better Thai restaurants around, sadly this isn't one of them.  Extra star for effort on our server who was very pleasant.",

Not terribly far from the strip, they are over by the outlet mall. We ordered some sate for our kids, which is their go to at Thai restaurants, and was a hit. Their pot stickers were beautiful and so tasty. I had never had them served this way with the sauces, normally they are with a sweet chili sauce at the places i visit, but I really liked their spin.   Wonderful visit. Highly recommended",

The noodle was okay but very greasy. Rice to go with the curry was stale and and not jasmine rice. How did they get such a high rating?",

So here I am, my scary movie selected from red box, my bottle of red wine, and my Thai food in its signature and ever so elegant stryofoam box... ready for my evening of selfishness and excess!   They say they are spicier than most places and they are right! Normally I get a 7 and it isn't spicy enough but this time at I Am Thai it is perfect. I love when things work out and when employees are honest (with a white girl no less) about spice level. They didn't look at me and say \"7 is too spicy. Well give you a 4\" Which has happened to me SO many times. Here, they were honest AND they gave me what I wanted.   So if you find yourself alone on Christmas, or just hungry for noodles and curry, head on down to I Am Thai. It is worth the trip for sure!",

Comparing with the average prices in Las Vegas in general, their pricing is very affordable while they still keep up with the food quality.   We enjoyed everything we ordered during our visit: Pad Kee Mao Noodles ($9.95), Thai Fried Rice ($9.95), Coconut Ice Cream ($5.95), and Thai Iced Tea ($2.95). The food was very well seasoned. The portions of the food were generous enough to satisfy our hungry stomach. Their Coconut Ice Cream was soooo good. It had a homemade icy texture with a good flavor of real coconut instead of the artificial powder flavor thing.   The place was spacious, a little old, but clean and well kept. There were only 2 parties including us so we had a good experience with our service quality. Highly recommend this one for their budget friendly quality!",

Could be better. Tasted very interesting than normal. The Pad See Ew was good. Noodles were soft. The papaya salad was decent and spicy. Other items were pretty good too. Their mango sticky rice and coconut ice cream was delicious! Service was super friendly and attentive.   AS ALWAYS, NOM FOR LIFE!",

Good service and food, super reasonable prices.  We had a curry and pad see ew, both were delicious. Our server warned us that their spice scale is a bit high - a 3 there is like a 5 at most other places, so keep that in mind if you don't like the heat.

Tables are spaced out nicely so you don't feel crowded at all.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is their specials menu, which I do appreciate.  Ordered fish cake and Thai dumpling appetizers.  The fish cakes were good.  I don't see this on the menu at very many places, but I was happy to try them and I was not disappointed.  It is an appetizer worth trying.  The Thai dumplings are made with chicken and mushroom, different from the ones you'd find at other places that are pork or pork and shrimp filled.  The ground chicken gives it quite a different texture and obviously a different taste.  My coworker said these are the best sui mai style dumplings he's had in Vegas.  Although I am not as enthusiastic as he is about these dumplings, I did think they were good and definitely worth a try.  For the main event, I ordered spicy basil with beef lunch special.  This is kind of my standard go-to item at Thai places.  I ordered it 10 spicy and it was just right.  In my book, I'd rate it about a 7 spicy.  The meal was delicious, it was on par with other spicy basil dishes around town.  The lunch special also came with salad and an egg roll, pretty standard fare, nothing to write home about.  All in all, an enjoyable lunch.  The service was great, staff was very friendly.  They were very accommodating when it came to splitting the check 4 ways.    If you're in the neighborhood, stop by and give them a try.  You won't be disappointed.",

We usually come in for their lunch specials which are super affordable at around $8-10. This includes your choice of the soup of the day or salad, egg roll, and choice of one of ten entrees. My go-to here is the SPICY BASIL. I've had it made with beef and also chicken. Both are solid. If you check into Yelp, your green Thai iced tea is on the house. (The server usually has to ask someone if it can be redeemed with lunch specials and they typically honor it.)   Lunchtime is bustling with business people, but dinnertime might be a different story. There's plenty of seating, suitable decor. A lot of empty space because of the sprawling layout. Maybe this used to be a bar, dance hall, birkenstock sweat shop? Who knows, but one thing's for sure -- we'll be returning.",

The broth was nicely flavored and it was perfectly piping hot and warmed me right up inside like Olaf getting a warm hug!   The girls working that day were very nice and quick on their feet with service. Pricing for the soup was reasonable, but I did think it was a little ridiculous they charged an extra dollar when I requested extra cilantro.

Lunch special was $9.63 total for a cup of egg drop soup, a spring roll with sweet chili sauce for dipping and pad Thai with chicken spicy 8 and a water to drink. They have about 10 options for the lunch special price of $7.95 including chicken, pork, beef, tofu or vegetable. $9.95 for a shrimp dish and you can substitute brown rice for $1.00 more. If you spend less than $10 you will have a $0.50 fee for using a credit card.  Nice open restaurant, kind of busy for lunch so if you ask for anything make sure you chase down a server.   Yes, I will return and try other lunch specials to see how the menu is overall. Everyone in our lunch group of four enjoyed their meal and had been here numerous times.   It was my first visit and really have nothing to complain about except that the Yelp check in offer for a free Thai tea was not available for lunch, they said it was only good for dinner (though there is no fine print stating such).

Our family of 7 ordered: Pad Prik King with Pork Pad See Ew with Chicken Yellow Curry Chicken Pad Woon Sen Deep Fried Fish with Apple Salad  Everything was hot, fresh and delicious and the service was outstanding.  We are already making plans to go back next time we are in Vegas.",

Their delivery was as stated online, about 45 minutes, but it came straight to my hotel door and was quick and easy. I also really enjoy non-fried spring rolls and this is where I felt they could have done better. The rolls were huge but basically just stuffed with lettuce. There were 2 shrimp in each roll (but placed towards the ends) thus the middle section was just lettuce. I only had one bite that had any cilantro so it had little flavor. The mass curry was good, although loaded with onions and had an expected amount of pork (you can choose which protein you want them to use - which is cool). I ordered it medium spicy and I was pleasantly surprised that it actually had a kick to it. If you are not a fan of spice then I would definitely order mild.",

Mango sticky rice is also the best I've tried! The reason I knocked off one star is because it's so overpriced I've been to other Thai places and they aren't as pricey.",

Not like most places where a 10 taste like a 4.   I have literally never had a bad meal here. Papaya salad - delicious, pad thai - the right balance, not to sweet or saucy just right, pad see ew - simple great, spicy bail chicken is ridiculously good, tom yum fried rice is one of those special dishes that you have to really question if fried rice can really be so good..   This is a small business and there foods is exceptionally great, the service is above and beyond. And there prices are well below this level of food quality.",

I use to love another place in Chinatown but ever since I found this place I am a fan. I don't usually write reviews unless I have an AMAZING experience or a Terrible one.

It's located in a strip mall type setting that looks a little sketch from the outside but when you walk they the doors it's very clean and pleasant. Our waitress, Alec was a great pleasure and answered all of our questions to the best of her ability. We indulged on the Appetizer sampler that had the steamed dumplings, crab ragoons, chicken satay and egg rolls each with their own dipping sauce. It was very good. They also had a special of a fried soft shell crab as an appetizer. It arrived with a siracha dipping sauce with spicy mayo and more siracha, oh my goodness it was great! My aunt got the coconut soup with shrimp and that was good, and I got the massaman curry with seared scallops at a 6 level. It was HOT but delicious. We both decided to get the coconut ice cream. Oh my, it was delightful.  It had chucks of coconut and some palm fruit in it, and it arrived in a coconut! Seriously, the entire meal and experience was one of the best I've had in Vegas so far! You will NOT be disappointed!",

Nicely decorated, soft instrumental music playing, Fountain bubbling.  We had great service and food was fabulous.  Large menu and you get to pick spice level.  I asked for a 5 which server told me it would be a 3 on their level.  She was so right, it was the perfect heat level.  The 3 of use loved our food and had plenty for lunch the next day.  Recommend you get the appetizer combo, pineapple rice, cashew chicken (not the name, but main ingredients).   I will be back on my next visit to LV.  We mentioned yelp when we got the check and they offered to make one of their appetizers to go with our doggy bags ..nice   reasonably priced.   Give this place a try.",

Delivery was so nice since I didn't want to drive in the wind, and showed up faster then expected. My personal favorite is the chicken pad Thai, with a medium spice..but be warned they don't play when it comes to spice, just like I like it. My boyfriend like the Mongolian beef, plus those potstickers are bomb dignity. We tried the wonton soup since we're not feeling the best and it was pretty damn good.

The location is great, it's a bit off the strip but still fairly close, especially by car. The service is excellent, our server was very friendly and very helpful. We received a tray of red pepper sauce, hot oil, and various other spices without even asking. (My family loves hot food.) The food was excellent, I ordered the Pineapple Curry, a dish I've been disappointed with at numerous other restaurants. Here at I am Thai however, it was perfect. There was more than enough pineapple, and the sauce was absolutely delicious. Portion sizes were perfect for lunch, and were given a copious amount of sticky rice for all of us. The sticky rice was served fresh and hot. The egg rolls were the best I personally have ever had. Overall, me and my family definitely enjoyed our stay. We've all been to many Thai restaurants, but I honestly believe this may be the best I have ever visited. If I lived in the area, I would come here everyday!",

You could say the reason we got such great service was because we were the only patrons but I don't believe that to be True.   You could tell the servers were kind and caring.   They answered all questions with patience, they never once made us feel rushed and they made sure our drinks were full.   On top of that I would say that this is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in a while when judging price to taste.   The food was fresh (I always judge the shrimp! ) and very flavorful.   And the value was spot on.   We spent less than $40 on 4 very filling dishes.   We'll definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "We found \"I am Thai\" a few nights ago as our family drove around starving and browsing Yelp - and I must say, this is probably my new favorite Thai spot in the valley! And, seing as I worked in a Thai restaurant where everything was prepared authentically by a 70 year old Thai woman - it's pretty hard to impress me.   The service was the first thing that stood out. All the waitresses were very attentive, had a great sense of humor, and never left a dirty dish nor empty glass on the table the entire time we dined.   The food was amazing. We had the beef jerky and papaya salad for starters. Then we had entrees. I had shrimp red curry, my husband had Thai style BBQ, and my daughters had shrimp tempura, vegetarian red curry, and shrimp fried rice. We hadn't eaten all day, so this was the perfect amount of food for all of us with a little bit of leftovers. I was greatly imprssed overall, but I have to say that the red curry typically makes or breaks my love for a Thai restaurant, and it was nothing short of perfection here. Yay!   Another bonus, the check was written in Thai. When we asked why, we were told it was so all the cooks could understand the orders (as they didn't read English). It's no wonder everything was amazing, it was authentically prepared. We look forward to coming back again very soon!!",

If you check in, you get a free coke! No refills on Thai tea or Thai coffee.  The calamari was great presentation. There weren't a lot for something that was $7. It seemed to be over fried. It was okay. I wouldn't get it as the appetizer though.  So if you get the lunch special, it comes with soup and egg roll. It says it comes with salad but we never got it.  We got the pad Thai. It was good. I really liked it. It was the right amount of flavors and wasn't overpowering like other pad thais I've had. It's good with chicken.  The papaya salad was okay. It seemed to be missing something.   The Thai sweet and sour is something I would not recommend. It doesn't taste good. It's more sour than it is sweet. I don't know if it was the pork or something else but it tasted funky.  The red curry was amazing. I really enjoyed it! If you get it with a 4 spiciness, it is enough for someone that doesnt like too much spice but good enough for someone who loves spice. The ingredients worked well together and it was the right amount.   We had spicy basil. It was good. It wasn't the best I have to admit but it was good. There wasn't a lot of basil flavor and I think that's what made it just good.   I would definitely recommend this place.",

My entree was a special non-menu item called Crispy Pork with Chinese Broccoli.  This was the best Thai dish I've eaten anywhere.  Apparently this is a frequent special because another reviewer mentions it, along with accompanying photo.  The next night I had the more conventional pot stickers and chicken panang curry.  Both were great.    I'll definitely return next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Very disappointing take out experience. We ordered via the yelp app and I drove to pick up the food out of our neighborhood because of the great yelp reviews.  Arrived 15 minutes after placing order. After checking in with the hostess/server, she said the food was almost ready and to have a seat. I was surprised that the food wasn't ready because I didn't order anything that typically takes a long time to prepare. Another 10 minutes of waiting and I received our food. There was only one table in the restaurant so I think they didn't start the order until I arrived.   It was empty but the dining room looked clean and nice, I thought if the food is good, we'll come back and dine in.   The food was very disappointing as well.  I'm a larb connoisseur, I order it at every Thai place we try. Unfortunately this was one of the worst ones I've had. It was way too sweet and did not have enough lime or citrus to make it a little sour and tangy the way it's normally prepared. The cabbage pieces were cut so thinly that you can't use them as a lettuce wrap but the pieces were too big for one bite. Awkward size. The larb was also prepared warm and I prefer cold or room temp but that's just my personal preference.   The steamed veggies were fine.  The basil fried rice with beef was also fine. The beef was tender and tasty. The green beans were crisp but the rice was over cooked and mushy.   The pad kee mao was forgettable and the noodles were overcooked.  Sad to say we won't be returning or ordering again.",

    "text": "I came here with family for dinner the day after Christmas. There weren't many other people in the restaurant but I'm guessing it's because it was so close to the holidays. For appetizers, we got the egg rolls and fried tofu. Both were really good and the presentation looked fancy. For my entree, I got the Spicy Eggplant and I chose a spice level of 3 since they said that's like an American 5. However, I didn't find it very spicy at all. In my opinion, it was closer to mild than actually spicy. They do give some chili sauce at the table though so I was able to add that. Next time, I'll request a higher number.   While the food was delicious (I ate the entire thing), the service was spotty. For some reason, we had two waitresses and when everyone got their food, my uncle was still waiting for his. We were already about a quarter of the way through our meal when he still hadn't gotten his order. One of the other waitresses (who hadn't brought us our food) came by to ask how everything was and we told her my uncle hadn't received his order. She looked confused like she had no idea that this had even happened. She went back to the kitchen and about 2 minutes later returned with his dish. I'm not sure if someone forgot about it or if the other girl forgot to bring it out but it wasn't the greatest experience for us since we had come for a family dinner and only one person was left without his meal through the majority of it.   Despite that, if you're looking for delicious Thai food in the area, this is a great place to go. All of us really enjoyed our meal and I would come back here. I just might come with fewer people so that the orders don't get too confusing for them.",

We ordered the shrimp rolls, two lunch specials and a coconut mango sticky rice for dessert.  Each lunch special comes with a soup (egg drop) or salad, along with rice and egg roll. Each special was $7.95. $1 more for shrimp. You are asked how spicy you would like your dish, on a scale from 1 to 10. I got 3 and my boyfriend got 5. He was sweating while he ate his red curry.  The food was good. The shrimp rolls were not over cooked or chewy. They came with a sweet chili sauce. Both lunch specials were about the size you'd expect, not too much but just enough. A great deal for under $10.  I wish they had served a Thai soup instead of eggs drop.  A note.. I did not see their health score posted. Perhaps I didn't look hard enough.  The food was good but it's nothing that I would go out of my way for.",

Parking was available as it is located in a small shopping center. It also helped that we went an hour before closing.  THE SERVICE: 2.5 stars. Tara who appeared to be the greeter was kind and welcoming. We were a large group of 15 so I know it wasn't easy to take orders from four families, however when we called before hand, they said they could accommodate our large party. The waitress who took our offer was by far RUDE!!! Was in a rush to take everyone's order, skipped over guest who weren't which enough to order, and at some point she dropped her order slips and had the audacity to  literally SNATCH them out from a family member's hand who was courteous enough to help pick them up. Her attitude didn't change until I mentioned OUT LOUD that she was being RUDE.    It's sad, but service makes for half the dining experience and this place did not meet up to the courteous customer service expectations that a paying patron hopes for. Lucky for me, I was in great company with good food, which made the experience a lot more pleasurable.",

    "text": "A Yelp search for kabobs led us to the place next door, but when we saw it was actually a pizza place we decided to try I Am Thai instead. I'm so glad we did!!  Although it looks like nothing from the outside, situated as it is in a semi-deserted strip mall sharing a parking lot with a Shell station, everything changes once you walk in the front door. It's appointment is lovely and inviting. Our server, in addition to being friendly and gracious, was exceedingly wise when she cautioned me that I might select to order my entree a little less spicy.   We started with the Fresh Rolls---vegetables wrapped in rice paper. We dipped them in the accompanying sauce which was so delicious we continued to dip the spoon in it after the rolls were gone.   I had Tom Yum soup as my main. It was tangy and rich and delicious. I was exceedingly relieved at our server's earlier caution about the spicyness. And when my eyes started watering and my face turned red she returned with paper napkins and an offer of cucumber salad or milk.   My husband's Larb was equally good. He ate it all in a wink (also taking advantage of the paper napkins).    What a fortunate mis-navigation!  We will definitely be back!",

It's really close to work so whenever I am craving some Thai food for lunch, I would order it from here.   I've gotten to try their pad kee mao aka drunken noodles, red curry, basil fried rice, pineapple curry, pad thai, etc. Everything was always pretty good.  Their pad kee mao is inconsistent though. Sometimes, it's great. Other times, it's overcooked and a little burnt. Their basil fried rice is delicious but their rice is a little mushy. I kind of wished their rice was more firm. But the flavors are fantastic. I love their pineapple curry! It has great flavors to it.   Their spice levels aren't something to joke about. If you can't eat spicy then beware. I've gotten a 10 before and it wasn't too bad. However, their levels are a little different when you order on yelp. I've ordered a \"spicy\" on Yelp and it was reallly spicy. I loved it but if you'd have to be able to take a 10 to take that. Their medium is perfect. It still has kick but it doesn't kill you.   Also, huge portions.",

I ordered from the lunch menu as I'm here during my lunch break typically I expect longer than normal service time as I arrived at Noon. What I didn't expect was getting served an hour later at 1:10pm. I got my lunch plate before I got my soup. I understand the lunch hour is busy but if I'm ordering from the lunch menu I would assume it would be ready to go rather fast or at least faster than other items in the menu.   The food was excellent it tasted great I ordered the spicy basil lunch plate. I ordered a 5 on Spice level (1-10) and it was spicy. For spice lovers you will like this plate. It arrived with side portion of white rice and egg roll. Plenty of food for a grown male adult.  Besides the wait I will highly recommend this restaurant.",

Service was so much better this time around! She was absolutely lovely and was constantly on top of everything.  The chef came out and was so sweet, explained the rubber duck area, and it was so sweet.  (You should check it out, to know the answer ) they've changed the ambience from the last time I was there, and I'm thankful for it.  It changed it entirely, and I definitely think this is a place to go to! For a nice dinner, for a lovely date, it will cover all bases, and have amazing food in the process.  I'm glad they changed up a few things it made all the difference in the world and is appreciate.   Ooo real quick, on their specials board was the Tom yum fried rice... ummm omg that was awesome, it was spicy, and slightly salty, but you throw some lime on top (which they provide) and it's just, wow! Have that with some Thai ice tea, and you have an amazing meal... Mmm that sounds super amazing, I believe I'll be heading towards my leftovers now.",

The fried egg was cooked to the perfect consistency and had an excellent texture, the beef was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  My fiancee ordered the Pad Thai with chicken low spice, the noodles were not over cooked (a problem I've had at other places when I get Pad Thai), I'm not a fan of chicken and loved how the seasoning made the chicken taste! The peanuts and bean sprouts were extremely fresh!  We started with the crab rangoons which were compact and well cooked, the accompanying sweet and sour was perfect!

We noticed the level of detail that was being shown by how the food was presented. WE did not expect what we began to find out. The server who was taking care of us did have an accent and we inquired where. Native to Thailand, He and his family came over 15 years ago and finally have been able to live out there dream. His mother who is the primary cook is phenomenal. This is authentic stuff not the overly salty overly flavored junk you get other places.

I had ordered a yellow curry, but it was too sweet for me to finish.   I do give one star for the atmosphere, though. It is spacious and clean as are the restrooms.  The music is not too loud and the lighting is perfect--brightly lit for the dark wood atmosphere.  The other star is for the lunch price. It was $7.95.   I will give this place another try some time as I don't like to write things off based on one experience only. Hopefully my first time experience was just a fluke.",

The ambiance was nice and the service was very good. The food was good, not excellent. We had Crispy Fish with Curry, that was good and curry very flavorful. Had the Tom Gak Coconut soup, a bit salty, however flavorful with fresh mushrooms. I had the drunken noodles, which they call Pad Kee Mou, very different from what I've had before but good. If your in the area, a good place to go. I prefer Arawan or Ni-tai-yas",

We walk in and the atmosphere was good but dark, there was only one customer eating there, the lady at the desk wasn't very friendly and lacked a lot of customer service. If I would have met her before I placed my order I would have just left that place but I had ordered ahead of time through yelp... We ordered Sum Tum I Am and Tum Yum Noodles. Sum tum i am did not even look appetizing at all. The chicken was over cooked and hard with no flavoring to it what so ever. The rice was old, you can tell they froze the rice and microwaved it, and the papaya salad wasn't even that good it lacked a lot of flavoring just like the rest of the order. The tum tum noodles were horrible, it wasn't hot or sour, it just tasted bland. We'd give them 0 stars if we could.",

The pad Thai was off the chain, and the green Curry fried rice was something we had never had before, and it blew us away. The staff was amazingly kind and helpful, drink glasses never got below half full. The duck fried rice is also amazing! Do yourself a favor and try this little mom-and-pop gem, you'll be back time and again.",

My husband had panang curry and asked for 6 level spicy which equals an 8 for Americans. He says it was excellently spicy and the best panang he's had.",

Service was great at the beginning but then very slow at the end waiting to get the check and it was not busy at all. Archi's takes the cake",

The lunch specials are well priced at $7.95 including a main dish, soup or salad, and small egg roll. The spicy basil (I got chicken) was very good. The egg drop soup was ok. Thai iced tea also very good. Just be warned that he medium spicy was making me cry, and I really like spicy food. So it will probably come out spicier than you think!

The portion is small too. - There were suspicious residuals in our water cups before we drank it.",
