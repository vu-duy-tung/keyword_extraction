It is part of the reason I use the Tuscany any time I come to Vegas.  Lunch is my favorite meal - the personal size pizza is huge for 1 person, and the soups are awesome. I love the beef barley soup. The sides and aka carte items are reasonably priced, so if you don't see what you want as a combo, you can craft your own without paying a penalty.",

Good prices on some good food.  See my pics!    The ribs were falling off the bone, WOW!  The Frisco burger was yummy juicy.  The steak n eggs were fresh and full filling.  AND the Lasagna was oozing over with deliciousness!!!!!  It was a great way to start off the day and end the night.  This place can be found in the Tuscany Suites less than 5 mins away from the strip.",

We use to wonder how they were doing it for so much less.  We have had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and never had any complaints.

The food is great. It was so good we ate here two days. On our first day we came for breakfast. My hubby had breakfast and I opted for a patty melt. The patty melt was de-lish-ous! It was well seasoned and just enough of a portion where I didn't feel like I was overeating.   On our second day we came for lunch. I had the shrimp skewer (which came with 12 very large shrimp). The prices are very reasonable also. You will not be disappointed visiting the place. 2 thumbs up",

Although this place is a little far ways from the strip(you'd probably have to drive/cab here) but it was so worth it! I came with my boyfriend and my friend and her boyfriend on a Tuesday afternoon after the advertised deals. But our waitress was SO nice to us. She was friendly, she joked with us, and she hooked it up!   Instead of paying $12.99 for New York steak and eggs, she let us have it for the special price of $6.99 even though it was 3:30pm before any of the deals started. My boyfriend and I both got this deal and it was worth the out of way trip here! The steak was nice and tender and I can't complain for the price! The servings were generous, and the buttered toast was to DIE for (: My mimosa was originally $6.95 I believe but the bill showed it to be $5, so she definitely hooked that up too! It was just the right amount of bubbly! The meal total came out to be about $20, which I think is a really good deal!  I heard that there's a $3.99 deal for steak and eggs between 12am-6am so I'll definitely come back for that the next time I'm in vegas! Good food, even better prices, and amazing service !",

This is my least favorite place to eat steak and eggs or eat in general especially how there are a lot of late owls roaming this casino wanting to grab a bite to eat. They do not split checks at night and they only take two types of payments: one card and the rest cash. I think it's ridiculous that they have to implement the rules that we can't split checks and on top of that we can't have multiple payments?! It makes it stressful on my group and other customer's groups, and it strongly deters people from dining in here. The cashiers sigh and roll their eyes when a group has difficulty arranging the payment method, and I'm just standing in front of them like you guys are just standing and taking payments, no need to roll your eyes when customers are struggling to pay because of your unnecessary rules/ limitations to big groups. Some servers are sweet and I appreciate that but other employee's just don't know how to hold customer service. When we dined in one time, my cousin put her head down because she had a headache and an employee comes up to our table to let us know that she can't be laying her head on the table... why not? We are paying customers clearly waiting for our food, what else should we resort to while sitting down?! I've only had steak and eggs here and it's good but never will I ever make this a go to spot due to the bad customer service and attitude.",

Fellow yelpers, how could you fail me so miserably?!  I made a special trip.  Not there to gamble, just to have breakfast.  I've had better food at nursing homes.  The eggs Benedict was unrecognizable as such.  Is that megaplex nacho cheese?   I didn't even want to try it because it looked so hideous.  Like congealed latex.  And the eggs were not even remotely poached.  More like hard boiled into some thing beyond a solid.  As in, like maybe something one would find on the surface Jupiter.    And the grits?  Well, I guess I should know better than to order grits in Las Vegas, but   these were somehow both watery and grainy at the same time.    I kept looking for the hidden camera, because surely I was being punked.  Top it off with a bloody mary that was basically clamato juice and (a half shot?) vodka with a touch of tabasco.  ie. about the most uninspired version of a bloody mary I've ever had the displeasure of drinking.    I rarely send back food and then not give them the opportunity to try again.  But this place was clearly beyond all redemption.",

    "text": "Solid 3 1/2 stars. My friend always raves about this place, (he usually goes Friday nights for the all you can eat crab legs) so he brought me here for lunch today to try. Friday, around 11am, no wait to get in. Restaurant less than half occupied. They were going to seat us right next to (and almost on top of) a huge, obnoxious group of people, although there were other close tables in that same little section. I wasn't going to ask to sit at a different table, but my friend did. Hostess moved us 3 tables over from where we were going to be originally sat. Menu offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert, and had a lot of options!! Also several options for us herbivores! It was a good 10 to 15 minutes before anyone came over. I figured service might be a little slower since we moved to possibly a closed table/section, but this was extreme. Especially since we were located very close to the kitchen walkway and servers were constantly walking past, ignoring us. Eventually a server strolls over and flatly says \"do you know what you want?\". No \"hi, how are you, sorry about the wait\", nothing. She was very unfriendly, borderline rude. He ordered the special, steak and eggs with pancakes and cottage cheese, (huge meal) for $8.99. I ordered a personal size (7 inch, $5.99) veggie pizza. You have the option of thin or regular crust, to which I ordered regular. We both ordered waters at that time also. She brought our waters, and then we waited. And waited. And waited. A good 45 minutes passed. He ordered medium for his steak, so it shouldn't have taken that long. Our food finally arrived. This is the only reason I gave any stars at all. His steak was cooked correctly, and said everything he had tasted good. My pizza (cheese, green pepper, onion, olive, mushroom, and tomato) was great!! They did burn the outside of the crust, but everything else was fresh and full of flavor. Never were offered refills. She did ask at one point how everything was. Took a while for her to drop the check. We were at a 2 top, very small, yet our table was never prebussed. (We had several plates due to his big meal). Cashier at the front wasn't friendly at all, either. All in all, the food was so good, and menu so large, at such cheap prices, I definitely want to come back and try other things and hope for better service. Maybe their wait staff was having an off day.",

It's remodeled since I've been here and for a minute I thought I'm at the wrong place.  Marilyn's Cafe is very nice. I didn't expect servers with ties. Anyways,  I ordered the T-bone dinner ($16.99) and added half a Caesar salad ($2.99). It was pretty good. The meat wasn't bad at all.  I got tiramisu for dessert and it was excellent.

Every time in Vegas I NEED to eat here or somewhere that has steak and eggs because it almost feels like tradition.  If I didn't it'd be taboo or something and my weekend wouldn't receive a blessing haha jk I'm just being a dork.  The service is always good and my boyfriend says that he feels like the steaks are shrinking in size or getting thinner, but $5 food is $5 food and I'm not complaining!",

    "text": "This place was such a horrific experience that it inspired me to write a review and to actually join Yelp just to try to have some say in helping others know to stay away from this obvious 13th level of Dante's inferno.  This is where all the bad people who do really, really horrible things are forced to go after they die.  Trust me.  As a person with 26 years of management experience in all manner of retail and restaurant, I can tell you that this place is falling apart and has lost its bearings at ALL levels.  The food comes out cold and with the attitude of \"I have been under a heat lamp for 7 hours, dear God please help me!\"  I have been here once and already know that their mantra is \"we can't do that, sorry we can't do that, sorry you can't do that No NO NO.\"  This is the complete opposite of customer service.  Want some specifics?  Okay:  Breakfast for Dinner?  Eggs cold and mixed with what appears to be Rico's Nacho Cheese from a 1985 General Cinema theatre.  Sausage out so long it has a hard outer shell like an armadillo.  Vanilla Milkshake that has all the right ingredients - milk, ice cream - but they aren't mixed up right, so you basically have 2 balls of ice cream floating in milk.  Nice try to deconstruct that dish my friends!  Pancakes were ok.  Hashbrowns were ok - ketchup can cover up all manner of sin.  My son ordered that awesome \"milk float\" and it took over an hour to finally get the thing.  He said, \"Dad it doesn't taste good, but I am SO thirsty!\" and promptly drank it.  I tried it.  Yep, ice cream in milk without being mixed.  We saw our waitress whenever she wasn't helping the other three hundred guests.  The drink guy understood a few words.  He made it with the water a couple of times.  Then we asked for separate checks and the waitress told us we could pay separately at the counter.  Then we were told they don't do that.  That would be ten times were couldn't do something.  The customer is always wrong at Marilyn's.  After a long discussion and working our way up the chain of command the manager, the wonderfully non-delightful Dana gave up arguing with us and told us flatly \"we will not separate your checks, just pay.\"  I gotta tell you, I've never been arrested for a thing, but I really did want to just walk away without paying.  I wouldn't even use my card because I don't trust this place enough to give them any information.  And that is ok, because they will never be getting another penny from me.  The casino either.  Oh, and did I mention I have some pull, some blogs and some juice here in the Valley?  Yeah, word of mouth is gonna grip tight on this one.  I guarantee it.  Go at your peril dear friends.  Better yet, get better service and some decent breakfast food just up the Strip . . . at Denny's.",

    "text": "I went to Tuscany on Flamingo Rd the restaurant there Marilyn's served us cold food. Under my steak was a short black hair. Right away less than 10 mins after getting our food I told the front cashier since our server was no where in sight after waiting 10 mins more she came to our table. I showed her the hair and she did not apologize but asked if I wanted something else (obviously I said no) and she walked away. Me and my friend sat there for 15 mins and decided to just leave. We walked outside and security came after us. I explained what happen and they said I had to speak with the manager. When we asked if the manager could come outside so it wouldn't cause us an embarrassing scene they threaten to call the police repeatedly. We went back inside. The manager was not waiting for us. It was the waitress with our check telling me that we walked out on our bill and I put my own hair into my food.  I told her my plate was barely touched. My hair is very long and black and my friends hair is very curly long and brown. The hair is pretty short, it was found under my steak and it had the root on it. This is why I was sure it was not my own hair. After accusing me the waitress walked away and I had to ASK a manager be called. I ASKED the cashier to call the police since my food was tampered with but he stated they could not call the police we would have to (after we were threaten several times that they would call on us). The manager arrived and wasn't told that a hair was in my food or that I notified two people before we left. He had to go find the waitress and confirm that information. He returned and told me no one in the back has long hair. At that point I asked him to look at the plate with the hair on it. He immediately looked at the hair and the food that was completely untouched and apologized and told us the bill is covered. We demanded security stop following us. It was a horrible experience. The customer service was terrible. If they sent security after us then a manager should have been notified, if a guest complains a hair is in the food a manager should be notified. I should not have been left at a table for 15 mins with no indication that the waitress would return nor resolution. It is poor customer service. Disrespectful to patrons. I will NEVER go to this place again. I will let everyone I know travelling to Vegas this year not to go here.",

I can't remember her name, but our server was one the best servers I've ever had...and I'm not just saying that because she was cute.  The party in my table came one after another so we all ordered separately.  Our server didn't mind at all coming a multitude of times to take orders and run the food.  She was the best!  The other servers during that time slot rock also.  As for the food, surprisingly the cut of the steak isn't that bad.  I only had to slice off a bit of fat strip on the end, but after that the steak was pretty good.  On the down side, this cafe doesn't have A1 steak sauce.  They have Lea & Perrins which is sweeter, kinda ketchupie, but it isn't A1.  Pancakes were delicious and plentiful.  So plentiful I shared half my stack with my little niece.  Can't wait to come back in Christmas time to take advantage of their $3.99 steak and eggs!",

    "text": "I love that they have AYCE crab legs here but her are the pros and cons. 1) only 4-10pm on Friday nights AYCE snow crab legs $24 per person and it comes with two sides. 2) there was a wait for us (25mins) they don't take reservations and limited options for large groups. 3) not that I needed to but they don't do split checks. 4) first plate was cold crab but the butter sauce they provide is over a tealight candle so that got warm. 5) my butter sauce began to boil and would pop up at me distracting me from eating- call it personal but I don't want hot butter popping my face. 6) took over an hour to get napkins. I know they're busy but I had to ask three people. 7) overall great price for snow crab legs but the atmosphere had me uncomfortable at times. Plus there's seating next to Casino and people love to stare at you while you eat. So that was uncomfortable too.",

This place has amazing food at very cheap prices. The quality of food is very good, and the service is always above average.   Gluten free options: They offer some gluten free options, such as gluten free pancakes (they are very good), and also have options such as scrambles, omelets, sandwiches w/ no bun. They do not have a specific menu, but they do offer some options, and they are happy to make substitutions.    I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good food at a very reasonable price!",

So when I checked on Yelp I figured it was Tuscany Gardens, which has some really good reviews. Big surprise when it turned out to be Marilyn's Cafe.  It's an effin' coffee shop!  No atmosphere, unless you like the \"ambience\" of a tired coffee shop.  And lots of people who can't talk in a normal tone of voice, along with shrieking children.  And a waiter (not ours) who goes to clear the vacated table next to us, finds no tip, and SLAMS the hard plastic drink card onto the table loud enough to make me jump out of my seat.  To further compound the misery, it was my birthday.  We weren't here to celebrate it, gawd no, but needed a quick bite to eat before an 8:00 pm Lionel Richie concert at PH, so we were captive.    Having said all the negative stuff, I had a Reuben, and it was genuinely good.  I hate it when I order a grilled sandwich and it's floppy and ungrilled, but it actually was perfectly done.  The table had the usual condiments, but I like deli mustard on a deli sandwich.  When I asked if they had it, the waiter brought me a cup of a very drippy Dijon.  Not quite what I had in mind, but it was better than yellow mustard.  I can't remember what my husband ordered, but just as before, he liked it a lot.    The service was pretty good, and if we're ever in the same circumstance, I might consider coming back.  The sandwich was that good.  But I'll bring my own mustard.",

There was a wait as apparently this place is pretty popular but it was do-able.   Services was ok, it did seem somewhat lacking but not horrible. There were times when I waited quite some time for a refill on my coffee. Also, I got my food before my mimosa arrived which was weird since it's a simple drink to make.   Food was average but you really can't complain because the prices are very reasonable. We walked out spending $30 on two breakfasts, coffee, a soda and a mimosa. On the strip you'd pay more than this for the food alone.   I would go back because it was ok food and service but the pricing can't be beat. You'll leave full without breaking the bank.",

From what I can remember, the prices are quite decent, if you're here before 4 am, I think you can get your steak and eggs for about 5 bucks? Don't count me on that quote, but for sure VERY CHEAP regardless. The place is located in the Tuscany Suites & Casino, and seems to always be busy when I'm here.   Menu has a lot of different options, but I come here for the steak and eggs deal for breakfast. With an affordable price, well cooked steaks, eggs and hash browns with toast on the side, definitely a great breakfast for anyone.   They do have other breakfast options to fulfill your cravings, and great daily specials for affordable prices as well. You will definitely find something that suits you. I always enjoy my food when I come here.   I will say that the wait for your food can be a little while, but I tend to not notice when I'm around really good company. Just keep that in mind if you're not the type to wait for a while when hungry!   Will definitely be back again!",

Steaks are the perfect portion size and cooked just right to your liking! Sure, it may not be the best steak and eggs, but for the price, it's excellent!   Service is great and attentive!

The four times that I've come to Vegas, I've stopped here, if only because I manage to somehow arrive to the city after midnight and it's the best deal around. The place is open 24/7 but after midnight is when you can get the deal. The steaks are fairly thin and when we asked for medium rare, we got medium well. I'd give this place 3 stars for that but since I come so often and it's such a great deal, I can't give it less than 4. Ask for it rare if you want it to come to you pink. The portion is pretty big so you can get full for little money.",

It was to my surprise that none of that really applied to this place.  The customer service was ok and our server was funny to say the most but the food was just OK. Nothing really to call home and tell Mama about . I ordered pancakes for my son and they were just mediocre. I really wish that I had just gone to IHOP but the ones out there received such bad ratings that I was willing to try something new as I usually am.  The bathroom was clean and the restaurant didn't smell completely like the casino so that was a plus in my book seeing as though I'm from LA and can not stand the smoking laws out there.  I'm a foodie but I don't mess around when it comes to my food  I most likely will never go here again.",

My boyfriend had also ordered the steak and egg. For $13 you get huge portions of steak, egg, hashbrowns, and toast. You get a good amount of food and quality for the price you pay.

Steaks and eggs are made to order and you can choose which type of bread you would like!  I personally don't care for the toast so I never eat it but for the price, it's not bad at all!  Servers are all great and nice, however, my biggest downside is the wait. The fasted I've gotten my food was 20min with a fairly slow night, avg 45mins, the longest I've waited was 80 mins and half our table was falling asleep!  So biggest thing would be to be wary if you have a large group and or there's a lot of people already there!",

We called our server, Angel informed him of the situation, all he did was say sorry and moved on.  Our party came to an agreement on our busser, who served our drinks and kept checking in us, making sure our drinks were filled and making conversation, making us feel welcomed, was  Willy, a Real customer service personnel...he deserves all the accolades and tips, the only reason why I'm giving this a one star....we will redirect friends to Rampart or Mainstreet Station for crab legs on Fridays (which is all u can eat) at least if we get empty crab legs, we can always go back and get more without being charged.....just saying don't waste ur time going to this place.",

Usually I would never go to the same restaurant three times but this place was phenomenal and very affordable.  They have a different special every day!  My first meal was the prime rib with the mashed potatoes and it was so great! The gravy on the potatoes was amazing. Must try!! I finished off with the turtle cheesecake but they had a whole tray with all different types of things to try.   The Marilyn's starter breakfast was a great deal and very tasty. I loved the sausage links and the pancakes the most  To finish off on our last night here on a Wednesday they had a Steak and lobster special for 13.99!!! Yes you ready that right 13.99.... the cheapest I've ever seen and it was the perfect amount of food.  Must try the honey carrots and Mac and cheese  Also- if you are a guest at the Tuscany suites they will give you coupons for 2-1 drinks here as well! So pleased with this joint and I WILL be back!!!!",

First of all, you need to walk through a large casino area to get to the cafe. The cigarette smell was not a good way to start breakfast. The seating area is okay, but pretty run-down. Our booth was comfortable though. The waitress was friendly enough.  Everything on the menu is extremely affordable, especially considering it's Las Vegas. The unlimited pancakes option was pretty great and only $4. The pancakes were perfectly soft and fluffy. The french toast I ordered was not so good: too eggy and not enough flavor. Ended up just sharing the pancakes.  You pay at the register, which was good considering we were in a rush. Total for four people was less than $30. There are definitely better places on the Strip. We would not come here again, but it was okay for such a cheap price.",

They didn't have A1, but I guess that's just personal preference.  The layout of the cafe feels a bit weird and the service can't expect too much.  The food itself was great. Ordered the fries with mac & cheese as my side. Since the cafe isn't isolated from the casino floors, there's a lot of background noises going on, but if I find myself on this side of town again, might stop in.",

    "text": "Came here for the late night/early morning special. I ordered the steak and eggs with a side of bacon & white rice. This was my first time here. I usually go to south point for steggs (steak & eggs) but a friend of mines recommend that I go here. Let me start off by saying that it looks nice and decent.   Food 8/10- The steak and eggs came with hash browns and toast. The steak was a good portion for me. I have a small appetite. The white rice was really hard. Being Asian rice is everything and with that being said I was disappointed that the rice wasn't really \"edible\". Also, I noticed that my other two friends who also ordered rice had a different portion of it. One friend had a nice scoop of it nicely on a plate, while I had mines scattered and half the size of his portion. My other friend had only more than half of my size of rice and it looked like the rice was old and leftover. They tried to trick us is into thinking all the rice was the same by not arranging it into a scoop like my one friend.   Service 6/10- We came here after an event. I felt like everyone kept giving us weird looks because we were \"kids\". The only guy that was nice and friendly was the one who served us our drinks. Our lady server was ok. I felt like she was annoyed and tried to rush everything. When we got our food, I asked if we could have soy sauce and she quickly left, which didn't get me the chance to ask for lemons.When she got back I asked if we could have lemons also & she asked in a very irritated voice \"do you need anything else?!\". I felt like she was only acting nice just to get good tip & wasn't genuinely nice or didn't really care about us at all.  Overall, I'm not really sure if I would come back... Maybe....",

I've gotten so many rare steaks and eggs from Southpoint when it wasn't even what I asked for (I always ask for medium rare and over medium) but for $5 how could I complain? Their customer service is also great! They're friendly and they always check up on tables. For a dollar more, it's definitely worth it for me!",

    "text": "I was leaving Las Vegas for an early morning flight to Chicago.  I had selected Marilyn's Cafe before the start of my trip and was glad I did. They are located within the Tuscany Hotel and Casino on Flamingo Ave off the Strip.  When I arrived at 4 30 am, it was very empty.  Table seating was instant and so was the table service.  I had ordered the \"Big Winner\" and it called that because it is a big breakfast!  2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, ham steak, toast or grits AND 2 pancakes!  Just what I needed because we all know the airlines don't serve food anymore.  The price was very reasonable for the amount of food and it was NOT a late night special.  It is on their regular menu.",

There menu is pretty large but I have only been twice so I haven't tried much. I will definately be back and check out more of what they have to offer. I'll keep you posted and update this review as I experience more.",

And the more they brought the portions were still the same they didn't try and reduce the amount of crab legs they brought. Crab legs were nice and meaty and you will never have to ask when are the rest coming. Whenever I'm in Vegas this will be a must stop on Friday night....though due to the popularity I'm sure in due time this price will go up and something will change. I sure hope not though....fingers crossed!!!!",

We had a perfect shot of what was going inside the kitchen. We had noticed a couple of servers coming out to the dining area chewing on something. As it turned out, they were eating food from the kitchen! I get it, things happen in the kitchen all the time. But don't make it so obvious. At least finish chewing before coming out to serve the food.  Besides that everything else was great. I had the T bone steak, it was great! I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy that came with it. Wife had the baked lasagna. Think she enjoyed it also. Service was great, and when we will stay at Tuscany in the future. Have no problem eating there again.",

It was tender and yet dry. Our plates were delivered close to 40 minutes after we ordered and a bread basket close to finishing our meals. The worst service in all Las Vegas area. Server was not interested in providing a good meal experience. Bad waiter. We are not coming here ever again!!",

    "text": "Do not go to this cafe!!!! A group of friends and I went to this place after a concert and were seated very quickly. It was late at night so the cafe was empty. We sat for 30 minutes before we decided to get up and find a member of staff so we could get started on a round of waters. Finally after 45 minutes we got our waters. Our server hadn't come to our table until after over an hour. We put our order in and waited another hour before we decided to find management and ask about service. Working in the service industry myself, I understand some times service can be slow, but never had I been somewhere with such lack of communication where it takes nearly an hour to be greeted and receive water. I had the unfortunate pleasure of speaking with Ann-Marie (I think that was her name) who was the manager on duty. She was very rude and simply did not see the problem with how slow our service was. As we were speaking about the slow service our food came to the table (almost 2 hours after we placed the order) and she said to me \"your food just came out, we will talk about this when you finish eating. I don't want you to complain about something else like the food being cold.\" In utter shock I walked away to at least enjoy my food. Which was fine. Food was cooked how I liked. My friend's steak was undercooked but no use in sending it back to wait longer. After we finish eating, I return to talk to Ms. Ann Marie and was greeted with attitude. I have never dealt with anybody this blatantly rude, let alone a manager to its customers. Dissatisfied with service, I had a problem paying full price for my meal. I verbalized that to the manager and she immediately called security to kick us out because we \"refused to pay\". Which was not the case. She caused a huge scene and embarrassed me and my friends in front of the Casino. We went to security to file a statement. I have never ever received such terrible service. I will never go to this cafe again. Terribly slow service and terrible management to match. Very bad customer service.",

I noticed the dining area seemed full but not overly crowed and I was pleasantly surprised there was no line like we usually find on crab leg night at other places we've gone to.  We were seated right away and greeted by our waiter. We both order the crab legs with 2 sides I had the loaded baked potato and corn, my boyfriend chose the baked cinnamon apples and broccoli. He loved the baked cinnamon apples says they were cooked perfectly. The baked potato was a decent medium size and came with cheddar cheese, a strip of bacon, butter and sour cream and the corn came in a small sized bowl but filled. I thought the baked potato could have been hotter. They brought us each our own plate of crab legs and the plate of crab legs were a decent size but they didn't come out hot they were room temp and seemed a little soggy my boyfriend didn't agree he said his were fine, they were still good tho.   I liked the touch of the tea light candle to keep your butter warm. They brought us each a second plate of crab legs before I could finish the first plate. I thought the second plate of crab legs was perfect they were warm and not at all soggy. The portion of the crab legs they bring to you is just right at least for us we were to full to get a third plate.   I like the convenience of them bringing the crab legs to you and not having to get up to get more crab legs. Overall pretty good and I think from now on this is the go to spot for crab legs.",

The restaurant was very clean and it was nice, Tuscany Casino is a small casino compared to what you expect to see near the strip. I wasn't sure on what to expect, but i was very pleased. If you order all you can eat crab legs and you want bread, you need to ask. They will only bring you bread when you ask.  The crab legs where delicios and warm/hot, which i love. You get to pick 2 sides. I got green beans and mash potatoes, both were great.   I'm giving them 4 stars because it took them a little while to bring more crab legs and also for soda refills. The waiter was really nice, I could tell that she got very busy and she was going back between tables. It's fine with me, i worked at a restaurant before and i understant how that can be. Over all great experience and the price is only $19.99 per person. *plus drinks",

Self-parking is plentiful, great location since it's a very short drive from the other big hotels on the strip.   Everything here is fantastic, I don't know how people had a bad experience. No problems with my breakfast combo, and my friends enjoyed their meal too. Pancakes are perfectly golden brown and fluffy, eggs made as ordered... bacon even made extra cripsy when requested. There is really is nothing to complain about: inexpensive pricing, service friendly and attentive with clean tables!  Just love places in Vegas that don't shaft you just because they can. Like when you go to a theme park and they say, fork you! we have you trapped pay $6 for this small bottle of water! Thank you Marilyn's Cafe, keeping this place in mind whenever I'm in this area of Vegas for breakfast.",

This place has the BEST FOOD and for the price the food just taste even that much better. Here is a comparison. My wife and I got a 1 breakfast plate(big portions), FOREVER pancakes(all you can eat), tea, and a coffee for less than 2 large cups of coffee and a breakfast pastry at Starbucks. The night before, yes we went there multiple times, got a breakfast bowl and my god it was so delicious. I pushed my stomach beyond what any human should ever do but it was so DAM good!!!!!! This will forever be a must for us if we come back to Vegas. It may be the reason we do come back.",

Now for my experience with the staff. My waitress was great! Very attentive and friendly. However, my experience with the manager on duty did not make a good impression. I was waiting to be seated and a waiter walks up to the hostess and asks her a question in Spanish. So the hostess responds to him in Spanish then the manager walks up. She then proceeds to say \"English only please\". I can't understand what it matters. As I get seated I then hear the manager continue telling the waiter now, \"if your customer speaks Spanish that's fine, other than that I want everyone to speak English\". First of all, this is Vegas, I hear tons of different languages here a few it's awesome to have so many people from all over the world descend here for work and pleasure, a True melting pot and that's part of what makes Vegas so much fun. Second, I wasn't being responded to in Spanish, my entire conversation with the hostess was in English so she was speaking English, the manager just butted her way in on a conversation and made assumptions. I don't understand why a private conversation can't take place between two co workers in a language that they want. I don't need to know what they're talking about and I doubt that they're trying to hide what they're saying from guests, a ton of people speak Spanish. Lastly, what if I was a fair skinned Spanish speaker and I initiated a conversation with the hostess before she arrived? Isn't that kind of dumb to make an assertion that I speak English? I really didn't appreciate how she spoke to the hard working staff.   So for that reason, unfortunately 3 stars.",

One day, I sat down for breakfast at 8:35 and was almost late to a 9:30 appointment next door because of the slow service. The next night, my friend ordered a salad while I ordered the pizza. I understand how one would take longer to make than the other, but it would be common courtesy to bring them out around the same time. Instead, they brought my friend's salad, and then brought my pizza over 20 minutes later. I sat there starving while she finished her whole salad. And then it took them another 10 minutes to bring the chili flakes and ranch to go with the pizza. By the time I got the condiments, the pizza was cold. And then the next morning, it took them almost a half hour to scramble two eggs. Two eggs!  The food itself is hit or miss. The pizza was good, even though it was cold before I got to enjoy it with the condiments. But I got the mac and cheese one time, and it was lame. It was like saucy noodles with shredded cheese on top. Needed more salt. This should not pass as \"mac and cheese.\" The eggs benedict was okay. I'll give them points for being very generous with the hollandaise, though it had a slightly odd taste to it. It didn't taste like classic hollandaise.",

For late nice and/or early morning breakfast food,  I like to go to Ellis Island for their steak and eggs etc.   Marilyn's impressed me however. The menu options are just as good as Ellis island, prices hovering around $9! Tried this spot cause it was new to me. My family enjoyed their steak and eggs and other breakfast options as well.   For this visit, I decided on the \"Las Vegas winner\" breakfast. With was 3 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 pancakes and hash browns. Perfect combo and totally worth it for $10!

First of all, I love staying at Tuscany because it is super close to the strip, very cheap compared to the hotels on the strip, & extremely spacious!! So much room to fit huge parties. And of course it has Marilyn's cafe. I'm pretty sure this place is open 24/7. They are known for their steak and eggs and it is under $10 I think! So cheap!!! It comes with some toast and hash browns as well! Pretty delicious, I mean of course it isn't some fancy steak but it definitely does the job for your late night hunger after the club!  I usually always order the steak and eggs but today I decided to try something else. They have a pretty large variety of items including breakfast and I was definitely in the breakfast mood so I decided to get a vegetarian omelette, a blueberry pancake, and a banana pancake. Yes, I definitely ordered with my eyes.  The wait was kind of long for the food.... but once it came I legit vacuumed my food up!!! Everything was delicious! Our server was also very friendly and delivered excellent customer service.  I would recommend the steak and eggs for sure and after what I tried today, I'm sure there are other great items too!",

The AYCE crab came with two sides I got the garlic green beans Which were ok, they were canned green beans with a tiny bit of garlic and slivered almonds, and a sweet potato which was served in half with a side of butter and brown sugar. The crab legs were little, like baby claw little served with warm butter over a tea candle. Wait times in between servings were about 20 minutes long.   As far as the service goes, I'll say the server assistant was more of assistance than our actual server was. She got our drinks, placed our ordered, got us refills on both drinks and crab and after we asked our server for the tab and he never returned, the \"assistant\" was ever so kind to bring us the bill!

But the all time winner is the sourdough toast.. its the perfect toast... It's warm, crunchy, and you can always always taste the butter..mmm mmm mmm, slap on strawberry jam and you won't be able to stop eating...

I like crab, but I don't LOVE it so I opted for the fried chickend, brocoli & mashed potatos. The mashed potatos were soooooooooooooo good! Everything else was ok. Now our waiter, Victor...was thee worst. I think he was having a bad day to begin with because when we got there he was having trouble with the previous table. Red flag #1 He was very quick with us, rude, impatient. I asked him if I could have the basket of bread that comes with my meal...he proceeded to tell me that I could not have it unless I requested it... Ummm sir that is why I am requesting it :) Some people at our table wanted to swap out their rice for something else because they didn't like it, he told us he was going to get in trouble with the chefs...etc.... And he also brought out an extra plate of crab legs and by the time they were ready to be eaten they were cold sooo unfortunately no one wanted them...he was really mad about that. I stayed as polite as I knew how to be before I went to management and let them know what was going on. I woould maybe go back to try something else, but I WILL NOT sit in Victors section #NOMAAM",

    "text": "From my friends who went tonight - me and my folks went to Marilyn's Cafe in the Tuscany for all you can eat crab legs like we have done lots of times. This time we had a terribly embarrassing experience. After we finished eating, and while we were collecting cash from everyone(they don't split checks), security was sent by our table and asked if we were enjoying our meal. First off, all the food was gone and table was cleaned. So we thought that was weird. We paid our bill ($256.xx) and proceeded to leave, when Daniel the manager and security stopped my husband and my sis-n-laws and asked who was going to pay the bill?!! When my husband said the bill is paid, he told him \"I don't think it is?\" And proceeded to say my husband fit the description of someone who walked out on the bill. He then lied and said that security must of seen something on surveillance that made them come over. We later found out from the security manager that Daniel called security before we were even done with our meal! When confronted, Daniel was very condescending and rude and just kept saying \"I'm sorry you feel that way.\" Anyway, we got our money back and won't be going back there. It's so sad that even though every person at that table works hard and honest everyday, we would be considered criminals based on the color of our skin. #RACISMSUCKS",

I'd never heard of such a thing and was skeptical about how good a $5 steak would be. I also don't like eating late at night but he told me I'd regret it if I didn't.  I was starving by the time he got back since I stayed up waiting for him to return. My take-out box had steak, eggs, hashbrowns, and toast. The steak, to be honest, was barely edible and had a ton of fat. Another friend, who was also starving, thought it was delicious and ate most of it. The eggs were scrambled, pretty bland, and could've used some salt. So... why 4 stars?  The Loaded Hashbrowns -- it's $1 more to get them loaded, but do it anyway (uh, it's only a $1). I can promise you you won't regret it, because it's the most delightfully delicious concoction of hashbrowns, gravy, cheese, and only God knows what else (crack?); especially when you're starving at 4 AM. I'd pay $5.99 just for these hashbrowns alone.  So, go. Marilyn's steak obviously won't be the best you've ever had, but for $5, who's complaining?",

Definitely one of my go-to places for a late night meal or drunchies (haha).   Their steak and eggs come with 2 eggs (sunny, scrambled, over easy, over hard), 2 slices of toast (sour dough, wheat, white, rye), and hash browns! I typically end up leaving more than half the hash browns just cause it's just THAT much food!   Service is definitely a bit slow in that time of night, so please bear with the wait times if you have a big party.   Located towards the back of the hotel, make sure your uber/lyft/cab drops you off at the 2nd entrance (not towards koval).",

I love the service we got from our waiter and busser...I wished I could've got my waiters name but I didn't catch it.   What I don't like is having to pay up front at the cashier. I think it is inconvenient. I did go and tried to pay for our dinner but I did not like how I had to wait there without be acknowledged by Sonia (the cashier...and could be the manager. I was standing there for a while...she could've at least say she will be right with me or one moment please. We sat all the way at the back so...I did walk up front and forgot to bring my ID because I'm paying with my debit/credit card. I was already annoyed by Sonia so I told her that I'm already having to come up and pay for my bill...now I have to go back and get my ID plus come back up. I took my card from her and went back. I asked our busser named Enrique which was nice of him if he can take my bill up front. He helped me out with no complaint.   Good service comes a long way and I appreciate good service! I gave our busser and waiter a good tip because they deserved it!",

It even comes with hash potatoes and your choice between toast (Either wheat, white, or sourdough), or pancakes! I didn't really like the pancakes as it tasted a bit like rubber, so I go with toast now. It comes with butter and jelly but I also like to eat it with my over easy eggs.  They have plenty of different condiments available but I stick with A1 and tobasco yummy !!  The texture of the steak is always consistent every time I come back too!   My friend wanted to try something new and got the baby back ribs for only $14 and got the side of salad and mac& cheese. He let me try both and they were both pretty good. The mac & cheese dish was fairly large--I'd get full just from that. He had leftovers for the next day! :)   This place is always my go-to when I'm in vegas.

Doesn't smell like smoke and not too much belligerently drunk people.   The servers are attentive, and some even remember my face and my order. It's almost embarrassing that I come here so much but I do appreciate those who value and remember their repeat customer.   The only thing I dislike about this place is how they don't split checks and how they leave the dessert on a tray out in the open. I get that they want to display it but that seems kinda unsanitary to be when it's in the walkway where everyone passes by. They need to find a better way to feature their delectable dessert.",

I think when I normally go on Saturday nights, it's not this bad, maybe people don't go to late night steak and eggs on Saturday, but they definitely went this Friday night!  Service: 5/5 - our waitress was dealing with a full house but was hospitable and friendly. She checked in with us once and assured us that our order was coming out despite waiting about 40ish minutes for 4 orders of steak and eggs. She then came out with a basket of delicious cornbread for us to eat while we waited, which was a first for me! Amazing service, props to this lady who took her customer service seriously. Even though we waited close to an hour after sitting to get our food, it was worth it.  Value: 5/5 - Great value, can't beat $6 steak and eggs (also comes with toast and hash browns). I always make it a point to come here every time I'm in town.  Taste: 4/5 - Not bad, not the best I've had, but good enough. I don't expect much but definitely gets the job done and leaves me satisfied. Can't really complain about the food, I always leave happy and satisfied.  Overall, fantastic service, can't argue with the food, and one of the best value places on the strip.",

    "text": "This is a review for take-out only.  I stopped by at 8:00pm on a Friday night and the cafe was BUSY!  They do have a take-out counter where you can order separately.  I ordered a MYO omelet with onions, turkey sausage and provolone.  Hashbrowns and wheat toast on the side.  The waitress said it would be 15-20 minutes, so I went back to my room, dropped off my stuff and came back.  When I returned, my food was ready to go.  The omelette was terrific.  With tax it worked out to just under ten bucks.  Easily the best non-mexican food deal that I found on this trip.  Hash browns were average, as was the toast.   Next time I'm staying at the Tuscany, I'll definitely stop in.",

    "text": "Marilyn's is a traditional American restaurant located in the Tuscany Suites and Casino ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/tuscany-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas#hrid:tHx9zD374l4yfy6zp3rLZw\">yelp.com/biz/tuscany-hot...</a> ) on Flamingo Street in Las Vegas. It was pretty late in the Evening last week, and we heard about the popularity of the $3.99 Steak & Eggs - there really aren't any more CHEAP Breakfasts around Las Vegas any more - this is one of the remnants from the good ol' days. The inexpensive Steak & Eggs, from what I understand, are especially popular with Students.  Marilyn's is named after one of the original owners of the Tuscany Casino... even though presently, the Tuscany is corporately owned. Decor is laid-back 50s, especially with the dim incandescent tube lamps over each table or booth. Reminded me of a Spanish Hacienda or an Italian Villa themed restaurant with the dark woods and dim lights.... in keeping, I guess, with the Tuscany theme of the Casino.  On the menu...  Prime Rib (**** $10.95) Meat! That's what I like! The only qualification of a good cut of Prime Rib, IMO, is... leave some Fat in my cut of Prime Rib! And that's what the Chefs at Marilyn's accomplish. Quite a bit more than the 10 ounces stated on the menu... that's alright by me! Side of Cauliflower (** 1/2) - way, way over-cooked, though. And a side of Baked Potato (*** 1/2)... pretty hard not to mess this up. Prefaced with some Dinner Rolls with Butter - OK. Also came with a tin of Au Jus - kids were asking why I wasn't dipping - I never mess up a piece of good meat with anything else!  At less than $1.00 per ounce of Beef - a very, very good value, especially with some Fat left on the Prime Rib. Lucky for me tonight, Marilyn's didn't try to get \"Healthy\" on me... Ate the Whole Thing! Nothing left on the plate!  Fried Bananas (****) The low rating for this Dessert was primarily my fault... took a little longer to finish the Prime Rib than I thought it would. Therefore the Fried Bananas just sat for a few minutes longer than it should have. I'm a meat guy... wanted to finish off that Beef before starting on the Sweet Stuff! Don't \"mess\" with the Fried Bananas with a side of Ice Cream... liked it the way if was... just Fried. Really, really good finish to the meal.   Iced Tea  Value (**** 1/2) As with most restaurants in Casinos, the value factor in a restaurant is usually pretty high because the losses you incur at gambling usually will cover the expenses that most Casino restaurants incur.   Not crowded on a late weekday evening, just three tables occupied when we dined here... BUT, as with any restaurant associated with a Casino or Hotel in Las Vegas... there WILL be lines and lines of people on the Weekends! This is a basic Casino Coffee Shop, if you don't equate Marilyn's to Fine Dining you'll be OK.",

She was taking three drunky people's orders and she was patient and didn't show any annoyance (at least not to our faces), since we were being loud and constantly laughing. Our orders came fast and for the price the serving was HUGE, almost couldn't fit three plates on a table that seats four. The steak wasn't dry and they didn't give us scrap meat either. I'm really impressed how delicious it was for only around $4.",

The $4 steak and eggs here are as good as it gets. It definitely satisfies your drunchies - it comes with toast and hash browns too! I've also tried the chicken pot pie, but it's $7 and still not as good as the steak & eggs. I've never had to wait in line, but then again I only come here around 2-4 AM. Every single time, we see a certain waiter - James - and he is the absolute best! I don't know how he manages to stay to happy and friendly and perky at 4 AM to all of us drunkards. I will be coming back again, and again, and again, every time I come to Vegas, and each time with new friends, so long as there are $4 steak and eggs here.

Sure, I should know better than ordering steak and eggs ever, but this was, at best, a mediocre rendition of the breakfast classic.  I have had better biscuits at Popeye's; this isn't to denigrate Popeye's, but rather to note that if you can't beat low-end national chains, then you probably haven't reached a threshold bar to a three star review.  By far, the most enjoyable part of the meal were the oversized drinks.  While one of my friends foolishly ordered an absurdly sugary pina colada, our bloody marys were decidedly average.  Here, that is a good thing.  Unless you are looking for super cheap food, I wouldn't recommend the trek over here.",

Portions are not huge, though satisfying-- option for a double order steak and eggs available for about $10. The late night steak and eggs special is not on the menu, but very much so available. Their thick, creamy clam chowder is also tasty and very filling! Despite being open 24 hours and numerous drunken encounters throughout the night, all of the employees here are wonderful! In addition to this, if you are sober enough to drive yourself here (don't drink and drive!), Marilyn's parking is easy peasy-- located right outside the Casino. No complicated parking structure to venture through. Marilyn's is perfect for late night, cheap eats.",

They have dinner specials that are ridiculously cheap but we ate too late for those and they have ayce pancakes for $3.99. Wait staff was attentive, friendly....restaurant clean and nice Tuscan theme. Also get 2 for 1 meal on Thursdays with reasonable casino play.",

    "text": "*ONLY REVIEWING THE STEAK AND EGGS, VENUE, AND SERVICE  Very very impressed with the remodeling of Marilyn's Cafe!   I only came here for the extremely inexpensive steak and eggs and they were significantly tastier and cheaper than The Steakhouse at Bill's. The steak was cooked well with larger portions compared to Bill's, hash was delicious, and the best part was that Marilyn's had A1 sauce (YESSS!!). A cheaper quality steak without A1 sauce is just not amazing to me.   I truly believe that Marilyn's renovation did nothing but benefit them. The food quality has improved leaps and bounds and the dining area is spacious enough for late night dining and extremely clean.   Also, I went here three times in the 9 days I was in Las Vegas during this past summer and I always had the same waiter. I wish I remembered his name because he was such a sweetheart. He was peppy at three in the morning and was extremely polite. He made the experience even better!  I am confident enough to brush off my prior statements of the Steak and Eggs at Bill's being better than Tuscany. Fellow Yelpers, Marilyn's Cafe for Steak and Eggs is the way to go! You wont regret it!",

Asked for salsa and was almost done eating before it was delivered to the table. Ordered a Cinnamon roll it didnt show so asked for it to be taken off the bill it was and was delivered no charge.. A little unorganized for the shift might have been a turn over going on at the time..All in all it was a good experience..Will go back when in Vegas.",

I asked for my scrambled eggs to be cooked \"soft\" and the waiter understood what I wanted. Just about every restaurant I go in and ask this, the waiter questions me as to what I want.  And when I got my food, my eggs were just like I wanted and tasted very good.  Hash browns we're much better than other breakfast restaurants.  Brown and yet tender--very good.   Bacon and sausage we're just ok.  Pancakes were light and fluffy with very good flavor.  I recommend this restaurant for breakfast.",

Whenever I'm trying to sober up from a night of drinking, this place comes on top of the list next to two others. Besides the actually steak and eggs themselves, I love that this place is located near the Strip. It comes in handy when you've spend a long night drinking whether it be in a club or at a hotel party.   The ONLY thing that keeps it from becoming a full 5 stars is the fact they have a certain time limit and day when parties aren't able to do split checks which kind of makes it inconvenient when you're sobering up and forgot to carry cash on you and your card limit has been completely maxed out due to heavy drinking.  All in all, definitely a good sober up place.",

If you've been or are pregnant, you know that craving will NOT go away until that spot is hit perfectly. tonight I decided to walk next door and give their cafe a go after hearing the food was decent. To my surprise- it was amazingly more then I would have ever expected for $14.

I will say the hash browns were good, but that is the only thing that was good. They use a disgusting version of cheddar cheese that tasted like powder and was almost not edible. The pancakes were obviously sitting in the heat lamp too long and the top of the top pancake was hard as a rock (and the plate was extremely hot which is usually a sign of heat lamp exposure).  The third time we went for dinner. I was between the chicken fried steak, the chicken cordon blue and the ribs. The waiter told me not to get the chicken fried steak (never a good sign when the waiter tells you not to eat something), and another guest told me not to have the chicken cordon blue. So by process of elimination I was stuck with the ribs which were also bad.  The ribs came with two sides. I chose the mashed potatoes which were okay but the mac and cheese was absolutely horrible. Probably because they use the same cheese as I had on my eggs at breakfast. Guess I should have anticipated that. Another person at my table also had the mac and cheese and also hated it.  The service was okay for a coffee shop, but overall, this place is crap. I will never go back.",

I am certain of this because the waitress said to us in a genuine way, \"We're so happy to see you!\"   I ordered fried chicken ($8.99 + $1.99 for side salad); the Mrs. ordered chicken fried steak ($10.99), and the kids agreed to share an order of lasagna.    The adults drank water and the kids \"made their own lemonade\" with water, lemons, and sugar packets.  Our waitress brought fresh warm dinner rolls and cornbread.  All of the dinners were very good, as were the sides.    The only thing I would have changed was the side salad came with shredded cheddar cheese on top.  This is unnecessary when I order blue cheese dressing.  Service was also very attentive.  At one point my son spilled water onto the table, and a staff person was right there to wipe it up.  Total with the coupon we got at check-in was about $24.  I left a good tip on top of that.  Not bad at all.  Thanks Marilyn!  and kudos to your staff as well.  You haven't seen the last of us.",

    "text": "The lady at my hotel gave Marilyn's a good recommendation for dinner. So I checked the reviews at yelp which were also good. Unfortunately it was not good at all.  The restaurant is in the back of the Tuscany Casino. It looks nice, sort of like an upscale coffee shop. The server was a little slow to take my order, which was surprising since there were only two people in his section at the time. I ordered the chicken parmesan, which came with garlic toast and spaghetti; no other sides. The wait for the food seemed a little long; again surprising since the crowd wasn't very big.   The meal was a huge disappointment. I never thought there could be too much cheese on Chicken Parmesan but boy was I wrong. It was completely smothered in goopy greasy mozz. The chicken was obviously a frozen reheat. The pasta was overcooked and soggy (honestly I'm usually okay with overcooked pasta, but not soggy). The sauce was the worst; it definitely tasted canned, almost Chef Boyardee-ish. Yuck!! The only positive was the dinner rolls that were brought to me half way through the meal. The service throughout the meal remained mediocre.  I was tempted to give them a one star... but to be honest, most of the people around me were ordering the prime rib (which was on special) or breakfast items. The prime rib with the salad and baked potato looked delicious and everyone seemed to be enjoying their breakfasts. And as you can see there is a multitude of positive reviews here at Yelp.  So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and TWO STARS.  Update: Not sure why, but I went back for breakfast a few days later.  The breakfast wasn't bad.  Again, the place was busy and everybody seemed to be very happy with their meals.  So, maybe I was just unlucky with the Chicken Parm.  However, the two stars still stands.",

    "text": "This diner-style restaurant is located inside the Tuscany, a casino where few younger party-folks venture out, and let me tell you... this place is freaking amazing as a 12-5am pit stop after the club for the $3.99 steak and eggs special.   No, it is not the most gourmet quality steak you will ever eat, but it's a healthy-sized, juicy cut without tons of fat. The taste is decent, made delicious with lots of BBQ sauce. And when it comes to the drunchies when all you want is a satisfying meal for a low price, it's def a great value. Comes with two eggs cooked as you like, hashbrowns (and they're good!!) and with toast of a bread of your choice - makes for a HUGE meal for the price.   Haven't tried anything else, but that deal alone is worth the trip. And the time window is pretty big - 12am is early in Vegas time!! If steak/eggs isn't your thing, they have plenty of other menu items and a couple other specials (I think  $5 monster burger?) but really, if you realllyy WANT something else, you're better off elsewhere!",

    "text": "Every time I'm in Vegas, Marilyn's Cafe is always the place I go to for amazing food at great prices whether or not I'm staying at Tuscany Hotel.  It's a nice little restaurant plugged next to a casino inside a hotel; just a 15-minute walk off-Strip. The atmosphere can be for casual or romantic occasions but, as far as I've noticed, a lot of people eat there after partying so expect a few energetic crowds. That could be because I always arrive at odd hours after clubbing or raving--anywhere from 3-6am. The decor is warm, the furniture placement is spacious, and the whole setting is inviting coupled with some of the best service experience I've had. With the right friends, this place is perfect. I remember a couple years back, after my friends and I drunkenly collected handful of escort cards walking down The Strip, we played our own version of 21 with the cards and the staff didn't bat an eyelash. The waiters and waitresses are very charming and friendly. Once, they even warmed up food I got from Earl's Sandwiches. Ask for something nicely and they'll return in kind. So overall, the staff and environment is really great.  Their menu is so vast--spanning at a whopping 127 total entree choices for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner (~40 each; not including beverages)--yet they don't lose the quality of their food and their portions are very generous. Each entree comes with your choice of bread and butter or jam. They gave me enough (delicious) baked ziti to last me a couple of days. I've also had their vegetarian omelet a few times which was a little more bland than I would have liked but, luckily for me, I like dousing my omelets in spicy sauces or dip it in ketchup so it tasted just perfect. My friends always, always, always order their Steak and Eggs which I would recommend for anyone who loves Vegas' meaty breakfast foods at affordable prices--sometimes they have Daily specials for this at $6.  Whether you're pumping yourself full of food for a hard night out, hungover, or just hungry, this is the place to be. With the friendly environment, great company, delicious cuisine, and college student-friendly prices, it's a perfect dining experience. My friends and I always visit here whenever we're in Vegas and we have some really great memories here. It's a tradition we plan on continuing for as long as we hang out in LV together.",

    "text": "This is your run of the mill Vegas cafe, but my review today will be based on their Friday offerings. Because of Friday, it's Friyay, and that's because you can get Cr-cr-craaaazy with their all you can eat CRAB!  Currently priced at $23.99 it includes two side dishes (mashed/baked/french fry potatoes, mac n cheese, fruit, veggies, etc). It's actually an impressive list of side items. Frankly, if you're there for the crab, like me, they just get in the way. My absolute favorite thing about their all you can eat crab is that it's served to you. That's right. NO BUFFET LINE!!! How awesome is that? They are steam crab legs, so buyer beware. In my opinion, they are outstanding. Much meatier than the Station Casino offerings, they are served with a little cut in the shell in them making them easy to break via hand. Almost all of them are juicy and not overcooked, which often happens at buffets. They even give you butter with a little candle under it doesn't harden. They must know that guys like me are in it for the long haul.  Oh yeah, and you always get complimentary dinner rolls and corn bread. These are really good too - the dinner rolls are always warm and fresh. The corn bread is surprisingly good, sweet, very much like my Mom's corn bread. Make sure to ask for it!  The one negative is that it can occasionally take a little while to get your crab refills. Because it's not a buffet line you have servers running around like crazy trying to keep up. They do the best they can, but often it' takes a good 4-5 minutes to get some additional crab. On a non-crab night their service is spot on, but I definitely give them some leeway given the demand they have on Friday nights.   In my opinion, this is up there with the M buffet for best all-care-to-eat Crabbing, if not a slight notch above because of price point.   Speaking of run-of-the-mill cafe's, they're kind of a thing of the past. I love the feel of older Vegas diners. Sadly they are all starting to disappear. There is something nostalgic about eating from a diner that opened in the 60's or 70's at 2am on a Thursday night.",

You get at least 12+ ounces of prime rib and their mashed potatoes with gravy was also great. Hooooowever. The flavor does tend to get old after a while and it just becomes hard to finish.

Yes, you'll have the old folks stare at you but this is definitely where you'll want to end up for your drunchies.   There's a special from 12-5 am where steak and eggs are only $5.99!!!

    "text": "Came here roughly a week ago to try out the steak and eggs special only to miss it by a half hour.   Tip: Arrive 15 minutes before 11:00 AM so you can get seated and order their steak and eggs special.  Anyways, as for overall experience it was great. I came with a larger group of 9 people so we expected a long wait but only waited maybe about 10 - 15 minutes before getting seated. No time was wasted and our orders came out relatively quick. It took about 35 - 40 minutes between getting seated til our orders arrived mostly because this place was packed. After finally digging it, I can totally see why. The food definitely is reminiscent of an old school diner, quality frugal eats.   I, myself, ordered the country fried steak and eggs. First time trying a country fried steak so this was a new experience but impressions were good. The steak was crispy like fried chicken with a mellow steak flavor when you bite in. Not too oily but it was also masked with their house gravy so difficult to tell. The gravy did help to cut the fattiness of the fried oil. Eggs were okay, not overly cooked nor undercooked. Would have hoped it to be a little less cooked. Seemed it was waiting to be served for a while as it was a bit drier.   All things considered though, the food was good and definitely met my expectations. Almost all their dishes could feed two people. For the price, the food satisfied my needs but if I were to nitpick the food could have been brought out when it was hot. Fried foods aren't as great once they cool down in my opinion. Additionally, their hash browns were not thoroughly cooked. It was watery and made the toast a little soggy.   All in all, Marilyn's is a solid choice for breakfast. The quality of the food is average and service was above average. The price and quantity makes the meal a solid four stars though.",

The meals are also quite large as well so if you're on a budget and you're looking for a filling meal, come to Marilyn's.  It's tucked away in the Tuscan Hotel and Casino. My boyfriend changed his mind several times before deciding on a meal and the server didn't seem to mind. I ordered a fried chicken meal which was huge. I could barely finish it. His friend ordered a steak meal with shrimp and I think my boyfriend ordered the same.  They have a super cheap pancake deal that is under three dollars. They also have daily specials. It's definitely a better choice than some expensive buffet on the strip.",

    "text": "Listen well: I come here with this expectation that any regular, run of the mill breakfast place--no matter where you go--...\"breakfast food is always horrible when it's not gourmet\". Some of you should write that down ;P   But, not everyone can just sit down and afford $20 breakfasts at the top notch places. Some of us just want steak and eggs and don't want to spend a ton of money (me)! And some of us are drunk and hungry and need a 24/7 breakfast place (sometimes me)!!!  That being said, Marilyn's Cafe is not that bad. It's on par with IHOP and Blueberry Hill in terms of food. And let's face it--every cheap breakfast place you've stopped at is probably horrifyingly average.  AMBIANCE: 3 - The Cafe, or at least the inside seemed out of place. The Tuscany looks like a classy casino, until you step into the cafe, where it seems a bit worn down and old. However, it was very spacious inside and they try to sit everyone at booths since not a ton of people come visit them!   SERVICE: 4 - Our waiter was really friendly and fast at servicing us. Our food came out quick--I know, how can it not?! It's steak and eggs!--and they left us alone for the most part except to refill drinks.   FOOD: 3 - Word to the wise: Alert! Alert! BYOW. Bring Your Own Water. The water I had was nasty. I would strongly suggest some bottled water, or maybe you could get a soda! My steak and hash browns  were okay, as long as I had it with steak sauce! Don't get me wrong, the steak was big and juicy, there was just something off with the taste.  The eggs were good! I usually order either scrambled or over easy with cheese.   Fun Facts: Their jelly that goes with their Toast is Heinz jelly instead of Smuckers! It's way, way better.   Times were fun, MC. It's a win when you're on a budget! If I go again, I might just taste their pancakes because it's so cheap!",

If you are contemplating getting into the restaurant business come see and experience 1st rate staff at this restaurant.  Everyone helps each other here.  Even though they were not waiting on us it was nothing to see fellow staff help each other out with tables they are not working.  The price you ask!  Is very reasonable, i felt guilty paying so less for some excellent food.  No I was not drunk when i ate here.  Well, maybe a few times.  We ate breakfast, lunch and dinner here throughout our week stay in Vegas.  We were not disappointed during any of our meals.  I would highly suggest 2 things.  Stay here and eat here.  You will have a great time and meals.  Oh yeah, WEDNESDAY specials Steak and LOBSTER!!!!!!",

I went over and ordered food to go to take to the lounge.  We ordered a Waldorf Salad, some potato skins, mini burgers and a corned beef sandwich.  Everything that came which was cooked in oil tasted LOUSY.  It tasted like the oil was rancid and had not been changed in a while.  The salad had what they call chicken which was not real chicken, it was processed and tasted nasty.  Needless to say, $38 down the drain because other then the mini burgers and the corned beef sandwich, everything else got thrown in the trash.  The sides with the sandwiches, the potato skins, the salad....Maybe the Steak and Eggs people talk about after midnight might be ok unless you are too drunk to notice any better, otherwise this is a place I would NOT recommend.

Thank goodness for the night life in Vegas where restaurants closes late or doesn't close at all. I know many reviewers stated they enjoyed their cheap steak and eggs, but we were neither late enough or early enough for that. So this review is for regular dining.  There is a special every day listed on their board in the front and their website. It was Wednesday, so their special was 4oz of lobster tail with 6 oz of steak and two side items.   Chicken Parmesan $10.49- My younger cousins both loved it. They each had their own order. No side items but had two slices of garlic bread. They were full from the pasta that the bread was not consumed.  All included two side items. 10oz Prime Rib $13.49-Not bad! I got a coleslaw and hash brown. It came with dipping sauce. Not a bad price at all! Turkey dinner $8.99- It didn't look appealing to me when I read the description and it wasn't good. The turkey slices were tough. 12oz steak-Dad chose medium rare, didn't try it, but he said it was good.  TIP: Open a membership card to receive their discount booklet. Since 4 of us were able to open a card, we took advantage and did just that. It had a 10% discount of an entree at this cafe (not including specials). No limit per a table.  Good service and food. 18% gratuity was included for our party of 6.  Will be back! I want to try their inexpensive steak and eggs!",

I have to say this staff at Marilyn's Cafe were one of the most patient people I have ever come across. They took all their abuse and ignorance. The reason I give this place 5 stars is because even though those guests were straight up rude. Not once did they loose their cool.

We shared and the hostess had recommended the latter as one of her favourites. Good choice! The chicken fried steak was lightly breaded and the chicken so tender; the pork chops were so tender you could cut them with a stick pen. I thought the coffee was excellent but my friend thought it was average. Jose and Miriam took care of us this meal (one of 4 trips in 4 days). Excellent service with excellent food!  Next trips, my friend and I got the Steak and eggs which are $5.99 after midnight and $8.99 between 0600 and 1100. Great steak! Emilia and German took care of us and again, excellent service.  These meals also come with hash browns AND your choice of toast and jams.  Because of this restaurant, next trip we will be staying at the Tuscany which houses this restaurant.  Good food, good price, good portion, good location, good service. Now, that is my 5 stars; get yours soon!",

    "text": "The food quality isn't the greatest but considering the price, it's worth a try. I highly recommend the steak meals as they're not only delicious but also reasonably priced.  Although the cafe is located within a casino, there are kid friendly options so bring the family.   The servers seemed a bit gloomy but service was averagely paced despite the early crowd.  The plates are large so that's a plus.  The country fried steak was salty but the eggs were alright.  Toast was just toast and it came with the generic jam.  The pancakes were tasty and my sister enjoyed it.  The greatest disappointment came with the french toast.  They were soggy and bland; it resembled wet bread and nothing more.   On the positive side, the servers were always ready for refills and attentive with the bottomless coffee.  The food is cheaper than most places and although the food isn't outstanding, it's filling and tasty if you pick the right choices.  The steak was cooked correctly to order, perfectly medium rare.  Each dish came with many options so it's easy to share.    Wouldn't stop by for another time of day besides breakfast but it was memorable.",

However, a restaurant this size should always be prepared regardless of crowd size, and waiting 40+ minutes after ordering for our food is not acceptable.  For a casino, food wasn't terribly expensive, but it wasn't anything great either. The prime rib melt was eh, nothing extraordinary but still okay. Tequitos and fried zucchini were a little disappointing,  but their burrito special seemed filling. If the service was better, I'd probably bump my review up 1 to 1.5 stars..",

DISCLAIMER: I've only eaten Tuscany's intoxicated, so my words may not be the sober truth. :)  Steak is juicy and a good portion. It's not your fancy steakhouse steak but it'll do at 3 a.m. when you're starving. Eggs are always cooked as asked (I mean, you can't really mess up eggs), and hash browns are cooked to a perfect crisp. I actually split a plate with my friend this past weekend and it was a great size for the both of us.  Servers are usually great and nice to everyone, which I think would be hard to do when you're serving dozens of drunk 20 somethings. Major props to them, lol.",

We did have a trouble ordering a beer for some reason it confused the staff. We waited quite a while for the food but we had no complaints given it was so late and we were so hungry. The value and the atmosphere were good. One thing I would not recommend if you are sensitive to smoke - there was a lot of cigarette smokers inside the casino.   Food quality was really only 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "WHAT?? $4 steak and eggs you say?? Yeees, I heard you right!  The steak and eggs were SOOOOOO good after a night at the club! Definitely worth the $4! They give you a strip of steak, 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and a lot of toast but be careful eating those as you will get full before you eat the rest of the plate! I asked for my steak medium and they did the cooking right! The bbq sauce on the table is so good with it! My eggs sunnyside up and again they did that right. Can't really go wrong with eggs though. The hashbrowns were so good with the crunch on the top. Throw some ketchup and tabasco on those babies and they're perfect!  We also got the gravy fries. Those were amazing as well. We didn't finish them though because we were all full from our steak and eggs.  This will definitely be my early morning spot when I come back to Vegas. I love that they're open 24 hrs.   Taxis don't frequent this hotel since it's not on the strip. My friends and I didn't really know what to do to get back to our hotel. Luckily a few minutes after we went outside a taxi came to drop some people off so we took that back to our hotel. I'm pretty sure you can go inside to ask the concierge if they could call a taxi for you though!",

The steak was good all on it's own didn't even need steak sauce, the eggs and hash brown was also great because I noticed they didn't overdo the salt.  I am definitely coming back here again!",

Other casinos that offer special cheap deals like this that I tried I was very disappointed overall with quality of the food and service and atmosphere but here at Marilyn's cafe you get great food made the way you ordered correctly.

Burgers, Apps, pizzas, and other stuff but the key here is breakfast. I want my breakfast after playing some pokers for a few hours.   We started off with some sweet potato waffle fries. Pretty good. Crispy and plentiful for the 3 of us. But what we came for was what we all ordered. Steak and Eggs for $3.99. Boom! Awesome deal. 2 eggs anyways you want, a petite strip steak that was tender. Not a hockey puck like Bill's Gamblin Hall's Victorian Room's steak and eggs for a $1 more. Oh yeah, it also comes with toast, which I got sourdough, and hash browns. Excellent deal and it hit the spot.   The German and Starsky got dessert. Looked yummy. Starsky got a huge sundae and the German got some chocolate molten cake. Service started off a little slow but once they took our drink orders everything went well. When we got the bill the total was $26! Easy game. I'll be back here real soon.",

The french toast was fine, but the bacon was limp and disgusting. The bacon, also, had a bunch of black specks on it, which I'm assuming is residue from the flat top. Needless to say, I didn't eat the bacon. Totally disgusting. The second time I came by it was about 20:00. I decided to order a club sandwich, despite the earlier issues with their bacon. This time, however, the bacon was fine. I made sure to look at it before eating. It was crisp and without any sign of foreign particulates. The sandwich was damn tasty, and it was a good deal like all their food. So, would I come back? Probably. Marilyn's is one of those old-school Vegas places that still has great prices and pretty solid food, which is becoming a rarity in Vegas these days. Coming here was actually cheaper than eating at the strip's White Castle.",

You can't really mess up basic breakfast so if a place does, then it really must not be good. French toast portion was 3 huge Texas toasts and they were fluffy, comes with the standard powders sugar and butter. My eggs were scrambled well and my hash browns had decent seasoning and golden brown. The grits were cooked well and had good texture to it. They put grated cheese on top just the way I like it. It could've used more salt, but hey that's preference. Good cheap breakfast right off the strip close to flamingo and koval.",

    "text": "I walked over here from The Westin because of the delicious photos I saw of the waffle sweet potato fries and the great prices. It also looked like the environment was a lot better than Ellis Island.  Once I arrive I have to wait 5+ minutes to be sat because the host is off somewhere else. Then I'm sat and NO ONE comes to greet me, ask if I want something to drink or anything for 10 minutes! Finally a server on his way to drop off a guest check at the last remaining occupied table in my section stops and asks if I have been helped. I told him no and he takes my order and brings me back a water using lots of 'here you are beautiful'. He was the only saving grace of my visit but that was short lived because I overheard him telling his last table that his shift was over.   I order the four piece fried chicken and it is brought out in about 12 minutes by a lady. No one comes back to check on me the entire time I'm eating. When I'm done I ask the food runner who I can get my check from and he says he'll let my server know. I find that interesting because 'I' don't even know who my server is. The lady who dropped off my food but never introduced herself or spoke to me drops off the check and asks if I want a box. I say yes. It then takes a little bit to get the box. As I get up to leave to go to the cashier she then yells out \"Thank you so much, have a nice day!\" as if she just remembered she wants a tip for her non-service.  So then I get to the cashier and it's a whole new barrel of monkeys. I hand the cashier my debit card and she says she needs my id for credit cards. I tell her I didn't bring it in my little wristlet because I didn't want to gamble and just came over for lunch. I say it's debit and I'll put in my pin. She says they don't have the machine and that I would need my ID.  I only left $8.79 in my wristlet and my check is $9.74 and I tell her again I didn't bring my license cause I walked and wasn't planning on gambling and just brought my debit card. I ask for a manager. She goes away, comes back and says the manager is busy but that it's their policy to need ID even for a debit card cause they are going to run it as credit and that I can go use the casino ATM. I tell her there is no way I'm taking out cash at a casino ATM and that there should have been a notice prior to a guest sitting down and eating in the restaurant that I would need id to use my debit card as that is not common practice to need one at restaurants. The large sign by the cash register only says you need id and room key if you are going to make a room charge. Seeing as how I'm at Tuscany eating and staying at The Westin that didn't apply to me. She then walks over to a small notice in small writing on the other side of the other register that says for credit cards you need id. Again I tell her that I brought by DEBIT card, and that little sign won't be seen by anyone, AND it would be seen after the fact. After someone has already eaten. I told her I'm trying to pay but I'm not using using their ATM and I only have $8.74 in cash on me and if the manager is too busy to come speak with a guest (I even showed her the copy of my work id that I have a pic of on my iphone that shows I'm airline crew which has helped many times at hotel front desks when I've locked my room key in my room and I need them to reissue me another one) then thatbis not my problem. Finally, she goes back to wherever she went before, comes back and takes the cash I do have and says next time bring ID, and I tell her there won't be a next time.  Between the horrible service, then the cashier incident, I would not go back to that place. The food was fine, but nothing special. Not to mention the pieces of chicken were 25-50% smaller than any normal sized chicken pieces you would get at KFC or the grocery store.",

The prices are an ode to old school Vegas back when awesome food specials would draw you into random hotels. Perfect for after the club \"sober me up\" delectables.  THE BAD: The wait!!!  Oh my goodness!  You'd better have plenty of time to spare cause you'll have 3 major waits to deal with. First off its not on the strip, Second you'll wait a while to be seated and finally you'll wait a longer while to actually get your food.  I believe the long waits puts an unnecessary additional amount of pressure on the taste of the food.  We wanted Steak and Eggs and Yelped this place specifically for that reason.  Sadly the steak was REALLY tough and the hash browns were bland and uneventful.   ALL IN ALL: Gets the job done but not at all memorable! Again it was probably the long wait that hurt the taste so I gave this place an additional star. With all that said I'd definitely go back at some random hour with less expectations.",

    "text": "We had some phenomenal service on a busy Saturday morning!  Nedra, our waitress, was awesome.  (pretty, too!) She was attentive, always nearby and had some great suggestions.  She actually seemed to be happy to do her job, not like some of the soulless eyes that stare back at you in Vegas.    Jeff got the eggs benedict.  He had ordered them the day before and decided to do them again.  They looked great and the eggs were perfectly cooked.  He got some orange juice.  It was ok, but it had a flavor that we couldn't quite place.  I think there may have been something else in the juice mix, maybe tangerine.    I got the chili omelet with grits.  The grits were delicious, not too dry and not undercooked.  They added a dollop of butter, which is the way that everyone should eat grits.  (Now, if they had some cheese, I might have added a little of that, too.  I guess I could have asked, but a chili omelet is already enough gut-busting damage as it is.)  The chili was kinda funky and didn't have much flavor.  The omelet was well done, however.  It wasn't too dry nor too runny.  I wasn't going to order toast, but then I changed my mind.  Nedra had toast out to me in less than a minute and it was hot and buttered.  Damn, that is good service.  Jeff got excited and accidentally knocked over his juice, all over the toast.  Within 3 milliseconds, there was a waiter/busboy with a stack of napkins to wipe up the spill.  He was gone and back in a flash with more napkins.  Nedra came over, tsk'd us, offered more juice and brought out more toast.  So impressive. Most places would just ignore you.   The style of the restaurant reminded me of broken-down Santa Fe style, though I'm sure they were trying to imitate some rustic Italian villa.  (It doesn't work.)  Normally, I would give this place a 3 star, but Nedra made it 4.",

It's inside Tuscany Casino which isn't such a great spot but it's well worth the trek for after club/drinking grub.    Now onto the flavor of the meal.  It is $4 steak and eggs.  It's not some prime cut ish you would find in a bitchin steak house.  But for the price you pay, you definitely get something well worth it.  Now, I will say that my opinion on the flavor may be a little biased and skewed cuz of the drunked taste buds that think almost everything tastes good.  But whenever I go to Vegas, this is a spot we end up going to at least once during the trip.",

The food was adequate but certainly not \"made with love\" as my partner put it who came for their steak and eggs. The plates are huge which was literally awkward when they put one slice of French toast on it next to your eggs. We asked for no toast but it still was on the plate but once removed the spinach omelette look sad & small. The prices were inexpensive for Vegas but it's an example of getting what you paid for.",

Sort of threw food at you. This time though, John, our server, was outstanding. He was right there when we sat down, asked for our drink order and didn't wait for the busser to bring them. Asked if we were still having crab legs, as we go there EVERY FRIDAY for them. We said yes, and he brought the bucket, my extra lemon and extra napkins before we even ordered it. Dinner was served promptly and he kept the crab legs coming, even asking if I wanted more just before I was finished with first order so second order would be there right as I was done. (So we wouldn't have to wait, since they were so busy). John is one of the best servers in the bunch. We have been there numerous times at different days and times since we are locals, and John ALWAYS knows what we are drinking and usually has some idea of what we are going to want to eat. He makes sure our drinks are always full, and if the bussers are busy he even clears the table so we don't have a bunch of plates piling up. If you want excellent food and extraordinary and attentive service, GO TO MARILYN'S CAFE AND ASK FOR JOHN.(he only works nights)",

I went for the all-you-can-eat crab on Friday with my coworkers and I'd have to say DON'T EVER GO WITH A GROUP FOR ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT CRABS. They don't split checks. There were 10 of us and the bill came to about $300. Once we went to the counter to pay, there was a sign that said they don't split checks. This sign was so hard to see considering how packed it was and people were almost always standing in front of it.   We asked for the manager since we all had debit/credit cards to pay with. The manager first said that \"the system\" won't let them split checks on Fridays but any other day it will. We explained to him that were unable to pay unless it was separate. He, then, said he could split the check in two for us and told us to use the atm. This still was not going to work as none of us with credit cards were going to get a cash advance for this. He sighed and mumbled something under his breath with attitude and said he'll split the check in three for us. Since we still couldn't do this the waitress stepped in and said she would void the check and then separate it. The manager told her that the voided check would still come out of her taxes and she said it was ok. So this manager said fine and stormed off.   We were there for about an hour just to pay for our check. I can't believe this place is getting business with such horrible management but I know I'm not going back again.",

Being inside the Tuscany is a plus too, as it is close to my home, they give me free slot pay $$$, the casino atmosphere is nice, they have a good selection of slots and table games, and parking is convenient and usually plentiful.  On this particular night, I selected their Ground Steak with Mushroom Gravy, and it was very good. Beef tasted fresh and the gravy was bursting with umami.  I choose their famed \"Loaded Hashbrowns\" as one of my sides, and they lived up to my expectations. Could have made a meal out of those alone!  My other side item was their warm cinnamon apples, which were fine, but did not look or taste like they were made in-house.

Our waitress, Patty, was the worst server any of us had ever had. She didn't introduce herself for over 20 minutes and failed to provide any reason for being so inattentive. Our food came out another 30 minutes later and was all cold besides the country fried steak. Although cold, the food was pretty tasty.   Having already watched our neighboring table wait another 30 minutes for their check, we decided to skip the suspense and approach the hostess to pay. We would loved to have express our frustration to Patty herself, but she was too busy using her phone to check on us. Luckily we made sure her manager knew of our discontent.",

The hotel itself is on the older side and not the greatest filtration system when it comes to the cigarette smoke, but the restaurant itself doesn't carry the smell. The food is great and decently priced. Service is good, the prices have gone up over the years but understandable. Good place to go when you are looking for a quick bite. The prime rib is good (best medium) if they have it available for purchase.",

    "text": "This review is about the AYCE Crab Dinner  Mediocre corn. Mediocre rice. Mediocre crab.  What happened? I use to love the AYCE crab dinner here because the crab was so warm and juicy. This time the crab was just room temperature and the sides were just blah.The only thing that improved was that they now put their butter on burners, so it never solidifies. The thing I hate the most was that they raised the Crab Dinner price to $15.99 (drink not included)!! That's 3 bucks more than when I use to come here not too long ago. That's a big difference. For just a few bucks more than that I can go to a seafood buffet with unlimited drinks. I don't think I'll be coming here again for the ayce crab dinner. It's no longer a great value.",

Just off the casino floor, it's a fairly open restaurant and is very convenient for those who happen to be inside Tuscany.  We came here for a cheap dinner before heading out to the strip.  I had the spaghetti with meatballs for a reasonable $7.  It's cheap and affordable and the portions are average sized, but reasonable.  My friends enjoyed their dishes as well and we all finished our meals and ended up with empty plates.  The service was pretty slow, and even slower when you realized that the cafe was not quite filled up at all.  However, we couldn't deny the deal we were getting.    Pro Tip: Apparently there's a deal for $3 steak and eggs early in the morning (3 am to 7 am).",

    "text": "Bottom line: eat here if you can, but it's really not worth the crazy wait in line if you can't get in easily.  On all my trips to SF, we always try to stop by Marilyn's.  We always see the stupid crazy line out the door, and decide we'll try next time.  This time, we actually saw a few people in line, and quickly took advantage of the situation.  SURPRISE!  There's ANOTHER LINE inside!  OK, so it only took about 20 minutes once we got inside, and we ordered a variety of breakfast foods to sample.  We go the french toast and an omelet and the side fixings that go along with those dishes.    It was good.  Would I eat here again?  Yes, if I don't have to wait more than 30 minutes to get to my food.    I will suggest Sear's Fine Foods in Union Square as an alternative.  I think their breakfast food is comparable - and there's typically no wait.  I know Marilyn's puts fancier ingredients in their food and such - but with the foods we ordered, it only mattered that it was well prepared.",

(why me when I seen others getting the legs) The claws were so hard to open I even spilled over the tealight trying to fight with the claw.   I asked the waitress can she give me more legs because it is difficult for me to open these hard claws.  The waitress was gone for a while and servicing others because it was quit busy in there due to the all you can eat crab legs.  When she would return she was always nice to me but she said, one thing and that this is all they have.  I was so disappointed due to I seen alot of folks with the legs.  So i order some prime rib taquitos.  (not good to me)    There was this one lady who seemed as if she was a \"busboy\"  always coming around asking can she get you anything and she is so happy to serve and help you. She did that a few times.  I thought How cool was she. I should have asked her to get me the legs.  I DON'T EAT CLAWS. LOL",

    "text": "Another one of Vegas' hidden gems.   This one is off the Strip inside the Tuscany Suites and Casino on East Flamingo Rd. It's just located around the corner from Ellis Island Hotel & Casino, another gem of a place for good and bargain eats.   Marilyn's Cafe is open for 24 hours and they have a daily special from 4PM - 10PM ranging in price from $7.99 to $18.99. Check out their menu here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tuscanylv.com%2Fd%2Ftuscany%2Fmedia%2FPDF%2Fmarilyn_menu%2Fmarilynmenu.pdf&s=058c956b1d556c5510a764436383d19c9cdee140a3eb269827d9a2c1f8cd27d1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tuscanylv.com/d/tuscany/...</a>  However...there's another special menu from midnight to 5AM. Yes, the special and staple that's ubiquitous of Vegas - The Steak & Eggs.   How much? $4.99  That's more than a bargain; that's a Willie Mays steal of 2nd base without a throw from the Catcher kind of steal. You get an 8 oz. of juicy, delicious steak and eggs cooked to order. These steaks ain't the cheap kind they serve in Reno for the same price. It's a good-sized piece of steak that's tender, meaty and flavorful. Don't expect a cheap steak for a cheap price, but it was pretty decent quality for the right price.   They also have an All-You-Can-Eat pancake for $3.99 for their midnight special. I'd have to say that's a lot of carbs for me, but it's there should you get the munchies.   And I have to add that service was impeccable. I forgot our server's name, but he was a nice gentleman that was well seasoned. By that I mean experience and class. Servers from other fine-dining establishments could learn a thing or two from him. He made us feel at home, comfortable and relaxed.   So the next time your in Vegas and hungry and starvin' like a broke-ass college student, don't run to the border or any closest fast food joint on every corner. Get some quality instead and your stomach and wallet will thank me for it.",

I've eaten here before but it's been a long time. We ended up here by default because Ellis Island had a 45 minute wait & we weren't up for it so I remembered this place & decided to come here. The waitress was sweet, however, the wait for the food was quite bit longer than we expected. When the food finally arrived, I literally shouted \"Hallelujah \"!! The waitress just cracked up laughing! Lol!! Anyways, this is a great spot for breakfast. You likely won't be disappointed.",

I had the country fried steak and eggs one day and eggs Benedict the other. I highly recommend going. It is very reasonably priced and you get a full breakfast.",

    "text": "I've always enjoyed coming here a lot, Marilyns is usually a solid place to get cheap, standards at good prices, close to the strip and with easy parking. Today's visit, my first since Jan 2019 was slightly disappointing though.  The first time I visited since the refurb in 2018 nothing else had changed but today wasn't so good.   Despite a few staff standing around it took a couple of minutes to be greeted/seated today which was an unexpected bad start, service is usually great here. This continued throughout waiting to order although when the waitress came she was friendly.  The menu has also changed with a couple of items sadly missing, such as the country fried steak as an entree, although in fairness they were happy to prepare this.   The food was good as always with generous portions.   In summary, it was still okay but noticeably not as good as usual - I really hope this was an off day and not a sign of further negative changes to come.   Dropped a star for service and one for the menu changes - I know the menu is still long - but this is one of the things I loved about this place. We still love you Marilyn's but please do better!",

    "text": "Been here several times in the last few years I've been coming to Vegas. Of all the infamous steak and eggs places in Vegas I've gone to, this place is pretty good!  Located in the Tuscany, just behind the strip, it was easily accessible and convenient for our group. Our group came here at about 3 am on Friday night after clubbing over at EBC. We were hella tired but wanted to make sure that we get our steak and eggs fix in. As usual, everyone ordered the steak and eggs special for $5.99. $5.99?!? That's right!! **Only available from 12 AM - 6 AM**  The steak and eggs special comes with a 6 oz. steak, eggs, hash browns, and toast. All that for $5.99! That's pretty great if you ask me. and when you're tired and hungry at 3 am, it totally hits the spot. You can't find stuff like this anywhere outside of Vegas. I got my steak medium rare with my eggs sunny side up. The steak was good, it was juicy and nicely seasoned. and the portions were nice as well! I just wish they had A1 sauce.  The service we received was nice considering we were a group that came in separately and they were willing to seat us together. However, this time around, it took a while for our food to come out. I've come here at busy hours before and it wasn't that slow, but this time it felt like it took quite a while.   I enjoy the steak and eggs here and am glad to have found such hidden gems here in Vegas!",

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The food is still of very high quality at a fair price ... but I sense some management cost-saving moves that require a one-star ding.  Now at 10pm, they hand out a VERY abbreviated graveyard menu. Instead of the full dinner menu I used to see all night long, that being a huge drawing point. The only True meal-deal on that menu is the $6 steggs. The rest of the menu looked more like a graveyard menu one would see at a typical 24/7 VP bar ... and for about the same price. Also I believe I noticed their very-popular dinner side, mac&cheese, has been dropped. I also overheard someone complaining that Friday night business has dropped off, since management changed the AYCE Crab Legs deal ... to a NOT AYCE Crab Legs deal.   Service was slower as well. I arrived just before 10pm on a weeknight and while I stood waiting to be greeted and seated, I watched no less than eight employees scampering about behind the two registers trying to pull-off a shift change. Eight people, two registers, really? I've seen shift-change here before and it was pretty seamless, never looking like this. My guess, new employees to replace veterans who moved to greener pastures after feeling the effects of these kinds of cost-saving moves.   From my arrival ... to seating ... to ordering ... to my salad arriving ... I'd say at least 35 minutes. Way too long for a casino diner. Especially one that was once voted \"Best of Las Vegas.\" And the restaurant was only half-full. I've seen it full-to-capacity many times and with service running at least twice as quick. I noticed a lot of hustling on the floor during my meal, but it looked sort of disorganized. I heard a manager discreetly chide a veteran waiter for the entire floor running behind. I read the frustration in the waiter's face as \"don't blame me for this mess.\" I had to specifically ask for more lemons, more napkins and my serving of bread. My waiter was trying to be attentive, but I think he was just spread too thin.   To be fair, I noticed the venue received a slight face-lift, with lighter colors of ivory paint & wallpaper that open up the space and make it more attractive & upscale.  And, again, the quality of the food was on-point, and the portions remained untarnished.   CONCLUSION: Proceed with caution.",

Midnight (when the ghouls come out) until 5 am (when the vamps open their coffins to go to sleep), they have a bodacious steak and eggs special for $5.99. 6 oz. steak and 2 eggs your way with buttered toast and a good landing strip of hash browns.   Melfer took good care of me with water refills and bringing my food. I was expecting it to take a long time like previous reviews mentioned but I got mine in about 20-25 mintues. I ordered 2 of the specials. Yes, two! Hungry as F! It was either order 2 of the steak and egg specials or keel over from starvation!   Well, I took both plates down. Toast and all! Crush, hammer, destroy! I'm staying here for a few days so I might partake in more of their wares. The portions are good and fair for the price. Price as stated gets better from 12am-5am.

I believe we arrived right before it got really busy.  Even though it looked busy inside the restaurant, there were still seats, so we got seated right away.  The service was actually pretty slow.  Our server took a while to actually greet us and ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  We both got Vegetarian Omelette's and two coffees (I don't eat meat and he didn't feel like eating any meat that morning).  The food took an awfully long time to come out.  The good thing is that the server communicated with us and told us that the food will be coming out soon and that it was crazy at the kitchen.  I appreciated this because we didn't even ask her where our food was, she approached us.  The omelette was pretty bland.  There wasn't much flavor and I don't think they added many if any seasoning.  It came with a side of hash browns and toast, which were both pretty okay.  The food wasn't that memorable.  The positives I can say about this place is the affordability.  A majority of the menu's prices are good deals considering how large to plates are.  However, the slow service and quality of the food overpowers the positive aspects of this restaurants review in my opinion.  If your looking for a breakfast spot on the more affordable side, I do recommend this place.  However, if you're looking for faster service and better quality food, I recommend you look somewhere else.",

A special taste that will remind you of a high quality home cooked meal, even while being on the road. While the low price of 5.99 will give you a taste of the old Vegas style values.  Additionally, Marilyn's Cafe also has nightly dinner specials. Meals varying from Roast Turkey to Fettuccini Alfredo Chicken, depending on which day of the week. My personal favorite is Steak and Lobster Tail Wednesday. Each meal meal costing less than 12.99. A great value for any night. A home cooked meal every night of week. Now that what makes these meals truly special.",

    "text": "One of the best \"unexpected gem\" secrets that I found out about by a Las Vegas native. I would always come to Marilyn's Cafe after clubs in the AMs for their Steak n Eggs which is like $5.99 I believe?? This cafe is located in Tuscany Hotel which is kinda far from most clubs but worth the uber/lyft over.   I believe their Steak n Eggs special is usually in the middle of the night which is the perfect drunchies. You can order the steaks however you want (rare, medium rare, medium well, etc.), you can also order the eggs however style you want (poached, scrambled, sunny side up, etc.), and you can order whatever your 2 pieces of bread you want too (wheat or white). It also comes with a big piece of hash brown. DEFINITELY WORTH THE COST.   Service was pretty quick but the food sadly does take a long time to come out. Sometimes when it's busy, the wait for the food can feel like forever. However, once the food is out, the happiness begins because the food is bomb. I think it's one of the perfect ways to end a night. The steak is definitely worth more than the price you pay. The bread is probably my favorite part because they put butter over it and it tastes so good and toasted.  Definitely a must go to place for people should go to when they're in Vegas!! It's definitely exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to be back here",

My kid is a night owl and even if we are dragging on our first night in Vegas, she'll ask us to stay up and go.  And we wind up happy about it every time!  On our last trip, two years ago, the steak was good.  Now it's a dollar more for the special, and the steak is great!  And the rest.  This restaurant can actually deliver an egg over easy.  It's perfect every time.  The toast, buttery and filling.  Hash browns, nice and tasty, well cooked and not overdone.  You need to know what's on at what time when you come in.  The $4.99 special is midnight to 5 AM, but a regular breakfast special for $7.99 is available mornings.  Or fill up on pancakes for...memory is a bit dim but I think it's $3.99 around the clock.  Be sure to tip your waiter on something like what the actual price would be.  Service is good and regular, ours always keep our drinks filled.  Hit the casino for laughs with the Judge Judy slots behind the cafe, or just hit the video poker up the aisle.",

We went to the Victorian Room at Bills I think it was, right across from Ceasars and it made me regret not coming here instead.  So if you want some yummy decent Steak and Eggs for the price. Definitely come here!  Also don't complain about the steak, it's $3.99 people so don't expect a steak from Donavon's. Lower your standards.",

The to-go section was a very short wait and the waiters were really polite and helpful.  We ordered gravy fries which tastes better than it sounds. They gave us way more than what $3 worth of fries should be worth and successfully sent my boyfriend into the food coma he wanted.

We had to come up with cash money, our server did not get ila tip, and they told us they were going to write her up. I have gone to this place multiple times and it was wonderful, but this was hands down the worst experience ever!. We actually went and talked to management ).   the manager on duty,  Her name was Dana.... She should be fired.",

Pleasantly surprised, Grilled Pork Chops ($10.99) - both 8 oz chops are well cooked and well seasoned. All entrees are served with two side items of your choice. I ordered steamed broccoli and apple sauce along with a side garden salad ($2.99) and a last minute impulse order of cornbread ($2.69) - which is hot, buttery, and sweet served with whipped salty butter.  Ps. All of their portions are huuuuuge.  If you are looking to grab a quick filling bite with immediate service, Marilyn's Cafe gets a thumb up in my book.   * Room service hours run from 6am-10pm * $10 minimum service fee * 18% gratuity",

He makes four AM seems like any time of the day and has GREAT local suggestions!  $5.99 for Steak & Eggs (Wheat bread, medium rare steak, over medium eggs for me please!) A perfect place to venture out to after the club at 4AM to help ease the hangover you may have the next day. My favorite part are the crispy hash browns that come with your meal!   Only one time has our service not been great & it was probably because James was not our waiter. A friend was baffled because he had some blue pieces of fat and let the waitress know. She kind of apologized, but also didn't care. \"It's just the blue stamp they put on meat sometimes\" & he asked, \"Shouldn't they cut it off though?\" & she kind of just blew him off. We get it, it's late and tips aren't great on cheap meals.  They do not do split checks between the hours of 4PM & 5AM! So bring cash or bring a friend that has a high credit card balance and Venmo.",

For one we waited forever at the hostess stand without even a greeting or asking how many are in our party & telling us the wait time like most places do. Instead many employees went to the stand and ignored us and others waiting. Like we weren't even there.  Then after finally seated,  I kid you not... 20 minuttes of awkwardly sitting there before a server came and got our drink order. Prob took another 10 min to get drinks to us. The Orange juice was nasty & server forgot my water I asked for. Tried drinking the OJ anyway but really it wasn't good so I asked for the water again. Water... even worse! But that might be a Vegas tap water issue...  Tasted like dirty water. Anyway, We had already read the menu so ordered when we put our drink order in. The food was decent but not amazing or anything.  Resturant was cute and reasonably priced. Those are the only good things I noticed about this place and I try to be a very positive yelper. They were busy-ish but still had many open tables so I don't know what the deal was here...",

What we got: - Pot roast with mac and cheese, mash potatoes and house salad with Caesar dressing $12. This was excellent. I loved the pot roast and was surprised at how soft/moist the meat was. The mash potato got raving reviews from my boyfriend and I was impressed with how tasting it was. The mac and cheese was a bit watery, not the best but not bad either.  - Coffee (unlimited) $2.39 I had 5 cups of this stuff and it was GREAT! I had several servers come by during to top me off with more fresh coffee before I was even done. The awesome staff even gave me a to-go cup!   - Tilapia with mac and cheese and broccoli $10  The fish tasted fresh and the side of broccoli was MASSIVE.  - Coke with Grenadine (unlimited) $2.39 Too sweet for me but the boyfriend loved it :)  Service - Was a bit bumpy at first because they seemed to be short staffed. There was a wait to get our orders taken and a wait to get our orders but after that the service picked up and staff was very attentive. A man who seemed like the manager was going around to each booth making sure we were all enjoying ourselves and then he followed up with me to ask if i wanted more coffee LOL, at this point I felt like an addict so I had to politely decline. Then I saw him giving out hugs to some elderly customers and thought that was really amazing customer service.  Totally worth it and I would gladly come back.",

Steak and eggs were still on our minds the next day, so we came out here before heading back home. It's $13 during normal hours, but you get 8 oz of steak, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast (we opted for English muffin) and hashbrowns.  Service was quite slow due to large parties, even though the restaurant was not full. The food was really good - not sure if that's due to my hangover state or the actual food. The steak was cooked nicely, although a bit more on the rare side of my medium rare than usual. It could've used more spices. But then, I'm not judging it like a steakhouse, considering for my one steak at CUT in LA I could've gotten 10 of these.  Tip: ask for the butter on the side. There was so much butter on all the toast/english muffin/etc that one of my friends thought she got a grilled cheese instead of toast before biting into it...  Overall, good cheap-ish option. Would have totally given this a 5 star if I had the $6 steak and eggs. Ah well, there's always next time.",

The management knew there was a huge event in the hotel but didn't seem to book more staff to cover the overload.    The staff were nice but just couldn't keep up. Plus, the management decided mid-stream that he would not allow split checks.  So, when we had had a split check one day, the next we couldn't.    The food was basic diner food.  Nothing special.  But then, you don't need fancy for every meal in Vegas.  If the service had been better, we would have eaten there more.

He has a smile, customer skills, and took responsibility for making the rest of our dining an event and fun.

    "text": "Hey guys we decided to check out Marilyn's Cafe after a night of margaritas. We were looking for mimosas and a decent breakfast.. This place certainly delivered!  Ambiance: Basic decor, the lighting is somewhat offputting and it felt a bit empty inside. It felt like we heard echoing but definitely clean.  Service: Wonderful service. We got seated right away. Everyone was well dressed. Our busser served us ice cold waters straight from lake minatonka and classic mimosas. Our server Noe was exceptional! Very professional and his timing was perfect. He even checked on us for additional napkins... it's those little things that set apart the service ya know? ;)  Food: Wolf got the chicken and waffles. It was served with syrup, a dollop of butter, and a side of ranch. The Belgian waffle was really good. My wolf really loves his syrup! You can even upgrade to the real deal pure maple for a charge. You can also add fruit and whipped cream. The chicken was surprisingly moist, it looked like it would be dry but it wasn't! Theres a burst of buttermilk flavor from the corn flake coating.  Kitty got the basic breakfast, eggs over medium cooked well. It came with choice of hash or grits and the hash was satisfying. She added a half order of biscuits and gravy,, that was probably the only disappointing feature if the breakfast. Rather bland and it came out room temp. Biscuits were only okay.  Will HOWL&MEOW  return? Most definitely!",

There were about 10 cleaning staff mopping and 3 servers with 2 host/hostess at the front. Didn't get orders in until after 5, but we had to wait for over 15 min and had to plead our case to get the special order. Long story short, we got the special, but only after speaking with the waitress and the manager. 3 bucks doesn't matter, but what matters is don't blame the customer for waiting patiently and then telling them sorry you didn't make it in time. It's about the principle, about customer service, and valuing your consumer- we enjoy coming here for the experience with friends, for the special, and for convenience. Overall we appreciate the ability that the manager remedied the situation and make what seemed an impossible time and  'computer' problem into a possible \"we'll make it happen\" positive experience!  Food was great- no complaints there! Thank you!",

I am staying at a hotel on the strip, but I wanted to find somewhere more affordable to have breakfast. We decided to walk from our hotel, it took us about 20 minutes but it was all worth it.  Right when we were seated we were asked what we wanted to drink, and then our waitress stopped by to take our order immediately after. Our waitress was very friendly and checked on us multiple times. She made sure our drinks were never empty, and that we were satisfied.  The food here is delicious, and the servings are a decent size. I will definitely be back here to have breakfast again, (or even lunch or dinner) before I end my vacation, this place is great!",

But every time the service was quick and very friendly.  They have food for all budgets and the menu is overwhelmingly cheap, and the service was just as good when we went in for a beer and sharing chilli cheese fries as it was when we went in for a full dinner. Our food always came quickly and we never had to wait long to order or get our bill   My favourite was having the New York strip steak (very reasonably priced) with a choice of sides. Would happily return next time we're in Vegas!",

Marilyn's Cafe is a super legit, super friendly, super fast, reasonably priced breakfast joint. The menu is huge - plenty of options for even the pickiest of eaters. The food came out fast, hot and delicious. There is plenty of seating, so no wait here.   Now is the ambiance that of a high end Vegas, boutique breakfast location? - no. Not even close. But, I'd come back and recommend if you need a good meal, you stop in as well.",

We ended up there because we were pressed for time and it was convenient.  I ordered the French toast with scrambled  eggs, sausage and bacon. I didn't  care for the  sausage patties at all, but everything else was ok. The French toast wasn't made with Texas toast so the bread was thin. Maple syrup is usually pretty thick, but this syrup wasn't... it was as if it was watered down or something. The OJ was darker than usual too. It obviously came from concentrate, but it was as if they neglected to mix it with water before bringing it to the table. We went it back and opted for water instead.  On top of that the service wasn't done with smile. Our waitress was a middle aged, Asian women. I don't recall her name, but she was pleasantly plump and wore a constant scowl. She wasn't exactly a ray of sunshine. She did come back to the to check on us, but that's the only good thing I have to say about her service. A regular patron came in and sat adjacent to our table while we ate. Our waitress perked up and greeted them with the most enthusiastic smile. Her entire demeanor and body language changed. It was weird...  The place was clean though and the prices were reasonable. I wouldn't visit again, but wouldn't discourage anyone from giving it a shot.",

We had family stay at the Tuscany the week of August 11. Our 80 yr young aunt enjoyed dining there. We had breakfast, lunch and Dinner.  It's definitely a busy restaurant but the hostess and wait staff really cater to your every need. Take it from me, I'm a very picky eater. I was drinking coffee for the 1st time. What an experience for us all...Lol  Very comfortable and inviting place to either start the day or unwind from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas day life.   We had a smorgasbord over the week, steak & Eggs $10.99, Marilyn's Starter Breakfast $8.49, Eggs Benedict $8.99, French Toast $9.49. Lunch: chicken Salad, Grilled or Crispy &9.99, Marilyn's Chili $6.99, Patty Melt $8.99, New York Steak Sandwich $10.99 They also have daily specials. It's family friendly and not cost breaking on the pocketbook. Thankfully we had the same magnificent waitress all week..Rizza. If one of us was missing from the group, Rizza noticed. When we placed to go orders, she always made it at the end of the meal so it was at its hottest. Rizza made our family vacation memorable. Certainly an asset. So if you're near Tuscany Suites & Casino stop by Marilyn's Cafe for an Away from home cooked meal.",

So, this was it!   Now for full disclosure, I'm not the type of guy to go out of my way to eat at an average casino cafe, but I just might for this one.   Fast service, decent pricing, and really good grub! The only glitch, the gravy for the biscuits and gravy was extremely \"peppery.\" Now clearly all cooks have an off day now and again, so I'll take this with a grain of salt, er, pepper! However, you'd think a little taste testing would occur now and again.   In any case, we liked it, and I think you will too.   Cheers!",

My fellow dining companions partook of Grilled Fish with Loaded Hash Browns, and Grilled Chicken Breast with a Baked Potato.  All portions were large, and all pronounced very tasty.  Best of all, Marilyn's is open 24 hours, and provides great value for the money charged.  It is a fine coffee shop serving exemplary comfort food.",

If you are a hotel guest, they even give you coupons and you can get 2 for 1 pizzas at Marilyn's...overall this cafe is the bomb-bizzle.    Customer service is wonderful also.

    "text": "Ok I don't want to get into too much detail, but look up the symptoms for Salmonella poisoning, both my friend and I had all of the symptoms within 36 hours of eating chicken at this place.  More egregious, was the service.  First, we decided to try to expand out lunch options.  There was a $10 off coupon in the local paper and the place is located near UNLV where we both work.  When we got there and were seated, we were optimistic when we saw the variety of options on the menu, we were confident that we had found a new lunch spot.  Sooooo at 12:05 we still hadn't receive my chicken Caesar wrap with sweet potatoes waffle fries or my friend's grilled chicken salad.  Nor had we seen the waitress or bus boy to refresh our drinks, that was until they walked into the room from some obscure place together after a half hour. . .We flagged them both down asked for drink refills twice and to please check on our meals as we were on our lunch hour.  Out came my meal with waffle fries that were not even warm to the touch. I sent them back and ate half of my wrap.  It had kind of an odd taste but I attribute it to strong feta cheese.  My friend asked for no dressing with her salad but asked for vinegar . . . The waitress brought her a bottle with about a quarter inch of brown liquid in it and said this is vinegar.  It wasn't.  It was soy sauce, so that went back. . .  We asked to talk to the manager; we had to ask four people to speak to the manager until he finally begrudgingly came over.  He began with \"You are already unhappy so there is nothing I can say to make it better\"  That is it. . .He would not even take care of the worse meal I have ever eaten in my life. . .which lead to 3 days of major illness.  STAY AWAY.",

WOW $4.99 for steak, eggs, hash browns, and toast that is such a great deal! It took awhile for the food to come out but oh well it was worth the wait! I was a bit bummed that my steak was more on the almost well done side than medium-well. All our steaks were not all correctly cooked to what we wanted but hey it was only $4.99 and it's late so maybe the cooks were tired too lol Definitely a spot to hit up for some late night grubbin!",

I ordered my pancakes as the 'red, white and blue' style - which means strawberries, bananas, and blueberries.. the bizarre thing (which I did not like) was that they actually mixed all the fruit into the batter - so I got pancakes full of mushy cooked fruit.  I guess it was ok, but not my favorite and not what I expected - I thought the fruit would be on top of regular pancakes.  Oh well.  Service was nice and quick.

I got a patty melt with lots of cheese, now i'm not lactose intolerant or allergic to cheese so i'll live, i'll be a big girl and eat it, but then I notice it's on the only bread that I know of that I do NOT like at all, Freakin Rye! but hey i'm already at home and maybe somehow someway they've taken all the ingredients I don't like on a burger and made this the best taste treat ever. Did it work you ask, did they accomplish the impossible?....... Do you see 5 stars?! Honestly if I was reviewing this meal alone i'd be giving it 1 star, I had to throw the burger away, but wait there's more I also ordered  a fried chicken salad ( to eat later) and I received no chicken on my salad, when she took it back to fix it she came back with grilled chicken. Oh I know it's healthier, but this is what I cook at home all the time I don't go out to eat what I make, and yes I let it go, I took it which was a good thing because as you previously read my burger sucked. I went out to eat and ended up with exactly what I already had at home. I do put up with it because the food is really good and the portions always leave you with left overs.",

    "text": "Anyone below who knocks this place...well I cannot not think of any other plausible reason other than they are just not smart and are expecting the moon and stars from a 24-hr cafe at an off the strip casino/hotel.  The place is clean, well lit, and decor was satisfactory. The service was just right. Only coming back when plates were clearly done or to refill beverages which clearly needed to be filled; and they were friendly about it.  The food was pretty darn good. The $3.95 all day all you can eat pancakes are beyond adequate for that price. The steak and eggs special, while not on the level to make Gordon Ramsay not scream, were very good for the price and you got to pancakes as a side. The steak was a bit thin and had some more fat on it thenI would have liked, but nothing to cry about. The eggs weren't perfect, but having been to Vegas 8 times in 6 years and having 40+ breakfasts, I am yet to find good eggs. So I was not unhappy. I didn't get sick and they looked/tasted like eggs. Little ketchup and Tabassco did wonders (as they usually do).  My group also, took part in the all-you-can eat crab legs on Friday night for $16.95. We took down 100+ legs. None of us were sick or even felt uncomfortable...just full. Again, not the best I have ever had, but really, quality shell fish in Vegas is hard to come-by (I live in CT, good seafood is a staple in my neck of the woods, so I am spoiled...very few places in Vegas come even close to what I experience on the norm).  I will agree with one Yelper down below...BRING YOUR OWN WATER. The water was a bit funky. It may be the local filtration process, I do not know. But after a 'long night in Vegas', water the next morning is clutch. Not from here though.  I would give this 4.5 stars if possible. But I went with 4, because of the Water thing, and the steaks were a 'tad underwhelming' (that may be too harsh, but it is the best I can think of). Definitely check this place out if you are on or near Flamingo at or East of the Strip.",

Oh yeah and there is plenty of food options and the price is amazing with good quality food.",

I went here twice the last time I went to Vegas. The first night I ordered my steak \"medium-well\" and it was too red and bloody. The second night I ordered it \"well-done\" and it was still red. It wasn't that big of a deal for me because I'd still eat it but it might irk some people. The hash browns were also a bit undercooked. I only eat the toast top of the hash browns.  But again, for $3.99, you get what you paid for.  Service is great though. They were friendly and peppy for midnight =) That's why I give them 4 stars.",

The service is very good. The atmosphere is nice, and this restaurant is spacious inside. There are tables and chairs as well as booth seating available.   It's truly \"hit or miss\" at these casino cafes. This is probably one of those little known/forgotten casinos and two of the restaurants here are really good.",

    "text": "Okay, this is definitely a hard place to avoid. I went back after 2 weeks since the 'no service' experience and sad face review. This time I made sure to request to be seated in my top choices of servers' area (I know them by name since I go there a lot). What I conclude is that  one time was a fluke but if it was my first experience I would've never gone back.  Anyway, all is good after I make the precaution of where to sit.   Food: as great as usual so here's a general list of things that I have ordered before.  Coffee: The most important thing during breakfast - awesome. I'm not sure where they get the beans but IMO, it's better than Einstein's Bagels selection and it's better then Egg Works. Not that the other 2 is bad, I just like this coffee more.  Steak and Egg breakfast special: One of the best choice you can ask for if you are a steak fan. Every time I have ordered it it's made to perfection of the medium rare. The steak is lightly seasons so some people may want to add more. I've never been a fan of hash brown but this place makes it good. You get a choice of pancakes or toast.  Marilyn Starter: No way a person can get it wrong. Generic breakfast of eggs, sausage, bacon and pancakes. Ordered it a few times but only once that they over did the salt.  Grits - just right consistency. Great with butter and adding a bit of salt.   Country Fried Steak: First time having CFS. Steak was moist and the batter was good. Would recommend.  Quiche: I had one with ham, pepper and onions and it came with a fruit cup. Probably the only thing I have ever gotten that I didn't really like. I was not a fan of the crust.  Sweet Potato Waffle Fries: A-mazing! Partial bias because by default I love anything with sweet potato. Still awesome to try.  Biscuits and gravy: Was a bit cold when I got the plate. Gravy is not bad but I think it would be better if it had some bits of sausages in there or just something else to add on the mushy texture.  Country Sausage Lovers Bowl: Aside from food coma in the middle of eating i. it's really good. Heaviest meal I've ever gotten from here. For $9 it fed me for 2 meals.   Grilled Chicken & Eggs: Usually a gamble when it comes to chicken but the chef had chicken breast moist and tender and lightly seasoned.  Overall: Just give this place a try, you can't go wrong.",

While there are a few choices in Vegas I always choose Marilyn's Cafe at the Tuscany because its 1. close by to the strip 2. its not crowded, no wait in line 3. it taste OK.  Your steak and eggs is $4.99 from something like 11pm - 5am, consist of a 6ish oz steak, two eggs, hash browns, and toast. Pretty basic, but a core essential in waking up without a hangover.   I've had the other food before on their extensive menu and it gets a pass.  If you do come here for steak and eggs they no longer allow bill splitting during steak and eggs time so bring CASH.",

Our waitress was really nice and attentive. She even had a great personality and was funny. She made it a better experience than it would have been otherwise (+1 star). The music and sound of the nearby casino is the major downfall. It's in the \"Tuscany\" and they have pop music on. If that odd mix of genre isn't enough, there is a slot machine that plays western ompa polka music about every 30 seconds and it's louder than the pop music. Overall it's a good cheap breakfast.",

    "text": "Best breakfast in Vegas!! I love breakfast and there are a million places to eat in Vegas so I looked on yelp for the best breakfast near the strip and this is what I found! It's inside the Tuscany Suites and Casino, straight back from the entrance of the casino. It's a 24 hour cafe that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. I would compare this to a mom and pop version of Denny's, with better prices.   I got the \"Big Winner\" which comes with 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast, hash browns AND pancakes..... for $8.99!!!! And this isn't even a special! They have cheaper prices if you come during certain times on weekdays. And the taste was GREAT. We really liked our server John. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made our experience even better.  Basically..... I can't wait to come back to Vegas to have breakfast at Marilyn's!",

We had about 6 people, but we waited around a half hour for our food. They might make you wait so the food can taste better.   I wouldn't mind coming here again, but I might only come when I find out when that damned steak and eggs special is available.",

My wife ordered a T-Bone breakfast and I ordered a New York Strip breakfast.   We both ordered the steaks medium-well but my wife's steak came out rare and my was overcooked and tough as leather.   The eggs, hash browns, and toast were average noting spectacular on par with a Denny's or Norms.   The service was ok, it took awhile for us to receive our check.   I really hate that my first review was a negative one, but I really don't want anyone to see the 4 star rating and think it's a great place because unfortunately it is just below average.",

The fact they have breakfast 24 hrs/day earns them 3 stars right off the bat.  The fact that the breakfast was tasty and excellent gives them another star.  I tried their sausage Benedict with grits, it came with a biscuit and gravy and some hash browns.  Firstly, very large portion, you can't leave hungry.  I wasn't too big on the grits but the rest was so tasty I wish I had room for more.  And the coffee?  Well this is the USA....so it was excellent.  Rich, strong and tasty, what a treat from the Canadian brown water we are subjected to.  Maybe this is why I travel the US so frequently, I love the quality of food.  And the prices...unbelievable.  Starting at $3.99 for endless pancakes.  My meal with coffee came to $10.00.  Other bonuses...free wi-fi, nearby casino, nearby patio = heaven!  Will come back for sure!",

    "text": "CRABALICIOOOOOOOOOOUS! That's what you come in here for. I came  here on the AYCE snow crab deal for $19.99. I've had my crab cravings in the past, and I'd call around the buffets in vegas (Bacchanal, wicked spoon) to ask if they specifically serve snow crabs. Why pay $40-$50 when all i want to do is get my mulah's deal worth on some crab action.  4pm-10p.m. only on Fridays. I came here around 5:00p.m., thinking that there'd be a line, but no, it was a shoe-in. Service was quick, waters were constantly filled, and the crabbies were loaded on my plate. You get two sides included (which isn't AYCE). I highly recommend the SWEET POTATO WAFFLE FRIES. Probably the best I've ever had in my LYFE, SON!   The french fries, mashed potatoes were average, and the fresh chips were really good. I just ate off of other people's plates, hence I got to try my medley of sides.   I was stuffed by the end of the night. They also had some cookies that they sell Subway style by the cashier. I like my oatmeal cookies so it was yummy for my dessert.   I'll definitely be back to fill my snow crab cravings!",

The plate comes with a good-portioned steak, hash browns, 2 eggs (any way you like), 2 whole slices of toast (white, wheat, sourdough). I usually order it, medium rare, over-easy or sunny side up eggs with sourdough bread.   TIPS: Dip the toast in the runny egg yolk for that next level deliciousness.   You get what you pay for, but this hits the spot every time, I've always left feeling satisfied. Plus, I've never had to wait, so definitely my #1 recommendation for late night bites at a very affordable price.",

I chose to come here on my birthday yesterday I have all the restaurants and hotels in the world at Tuscany Suites. I'm sorry I ever came-due to the unprofessional inattentive servers,  I got no service no one took my order after 15 minutes, and I had to attend a show which was a total farce. (Because the performers at the rat pack is back we're different than the ones that I thought I was getting you could sing on key.)  I asked what do you do for birthdays and they said oh we do nothing. Marilyn's doesn't have one dessert listed on their menu and I asked pacifically bring me something cake or something with a candle they couldn't even do that! Finally, after having the most un-festive birthday I ever paid for in history, I went back to Marilyn's  at one of the morning and the manager on duty found a massive dessert platter and put a candle on it and she sang happy birthday to me.  Why the hell couldnt they have done that when they were supposed to?  Why was I told they don't do anything for birthdays, no cake,  no ice cream etc?",

The Roast Beef came out PURPLISH GRAY AND I COULDN'T CUT IT WITH MY KNIFE.... sent it back and ordered the steak instead..  Waited one hour for my steak to come out of the kitchen.  My friend meanwhile finished his steak which was OK nothing to rave about, but was still waiting for his vegetable corn to come to the table.  He had ordered glazed carrots which came out of the kitchen brown and carrots are orange so he sent them back and said he'd have corn instead. He was finished his steak when the corn finally came out, but my steak was still a mystery.  Were they butchering the cow out back in order to make my steak?  After waiting one hour I asked for the manager and he really did nothing much but say \"I'll go look in the kitchen\"....instead of saying \" I'm sorry you are waiting so long, what can I do to make it better.\"... nothing, couldn't care less.  Finally my steak came out and I ate it, just to eat something because after waiting that long I was hungry.   I decided to put in a complaint to management and asked for the GM of the restaurant to call me .... as of this writing he still has not called me to find out what happened, or offer an apology for the terrible food we were served and length of time it took to get it.   Tuscany's restaurant Marilyn's Cafe is terrible.  Sure they have specials which is where they do most of their business, but for regular dinner items.... they serve food that really could make you ill, purplish gray roast beef?  and the waiter brings it out, instead of saying to the cook this doesn't look right.   Will never eat there again and my advice would be don't bother to dine at Marilyn's Cafe, you'd be better off at the IHOP or Dennys, at least there food is the color it is supposed to be and you don't wait an hour for it..... Terrible, terrible dining experience.",

The corned beef reuben is freakin amazing too. Top notch Reuben I have to say. I was very impressed, and I'm usually a Pastrami Reuben kind of guy, so it says a lot when a corned beef reuben does it this well for me. All in all, this place is great, I will definitely eat here again next time I'm in Vegas.",

Most people around me ordered the Steak and Eggs and it seemed to be a hit! I would definitely recommend giving Marilyn's a try!",

I also had the fish and chips, though ALSO with mashed potatoes and gravy, as well as green beans, which, God bless Marilyn's Cafe, had bits of bacon in it. And grease.  Service was snappy and friendly, even when the place was packed to the gills with geriatrics and hungry drunks. They made a minor error with a to go order but quickly resolved it.

They convinced me to come here for late night food and we got there at around 3:30am Sunday morning.   Based on location and decor, I was not feeling this place. Only thing that saved my hesitation though was the fact that so many people were there at that foresaken hour!  We each got the famous steak and eggs (steak medium and eggs scrambled) and damnnnn was I in for a treat! Eggs done well, steak just the right portion size and texture, a ton of crispy hash browns, and toast slathered in butter beauty. OMG talk about satisfying!   I didn't care about the decor, I didn't care that we went off the strip to get here, and I def didn't care that I was eating that much food in the middle of the night! AND ONLY $4.99?!!! So much beauty in one night.  Woooooo good work Marilyn's Cafe! You made a fan out of a disbeliever!",

While my fiance said the steak was good, that is where the compliments end. I also ordered the corned-beef hash which arrived with a big long blonde hair in it. Needless to say I was disgusted. My server looked at me and asked if I wanted a new one. No apology, no visit from the manager. Nothing. I said no thank you and tried to eat the rest of my food. My fiance had ordered a bagel, which after asking two times never showed up. After pointing this out to our server she appeared to realize her tip was in jeopardy and wrote us off. With an eye-roll she walked away and did not come back to refill drinks or ask how our food was. My food was cold and a bit salty. Another friend of ours got the fires with gravy. He stated they were just \"ok\".   I am really not getting all the positive reviews for this place. Service was awful, managers were MIA, no attempt to remedy the problems or care that we were happy in the slightest. Avoid at all costs. There are way too many choices in Vegas to settle for this mediocrity.",

Egg white omelette with thinly sliced turkey and an avocado verde sauce. My boyfriend had the Belgium waffle topped with cinnamon apples. My best friend had two chocolate chip/strawberry pancakes with a side of hash browns. My omelette lacked so much flavor and the turkey was painfully dry. The avocado verde sauce was DECENT but, in all honesty, I can do a better job in my own kitchen. My boyfriends waffle wasn't any better. I think he would've been happier with a stack of Eggos. And my best friend described her pancakes as \"no better than iHop.\" Not to mention, her hash browns were drenched in oil. Our meal was not worth the price. I would have rather bought groceries and cooked breakfast on my own in my hotel room.   The ONE upside, (which is why I had to give two stars instead of one), is that they will bring you complimentary bread upon request. The corn bread is to die for and the dinner rolls are delicious as well.  I still wouldn't return. But just to help you out... Request the bread!",

Great selections and even better prices!!! A lot of dining places close early, so this spot is awesome for being 24/7. The service is attentive and the food/cappuccino is delicious!   My only real complaint is the overbearing ciggie smell (gross). The only thing that makes that somewhat ok is I'm so hungry I just focus on food (that or I've been drinking...haha)! Oh & bring a jacket you sexy ladies, unless you don't mind all the stares (cuz this is a \"dive\" restaurant).",

After wandering into the Tuscany hotel and casino, we were directed to Marilyn's Cafe. As a group of 5, my friends and I were seated nearly immediately. Once our waiter came around to take our order, he automatically asked if all wanted the steak and eggs. Assumption correct!  At $5.99, the steak and eggs were such a steal! Steak and eggs were both cooked according to personal preferences and they even include toast plus hashbrowns.  Not sure if it was just the late night hunger talking or what, but the steak was delicious! Best $5.99 I spent in Vegas! I'd definitely recommend coming here!",

Food was great and extremely inexpensive for Vegas, we're from Orange County and even at diners we're used to unnecessarily high restaurant prices so my boyfriend and I were both pretty surprised at how reasonable it was.  The service, however, is what the five stars is for.  James was our waiter and I'm pretty sure I've never had a sweeter, more helpful gentleman assist us. He was prompt, kind, and enthusiastic. He checked on us constantly even though the place was packed (at 1:30 am too!) and I know they were slammed that weekend since most of the city was booked out completely, including the Tuscany. We even called the manager over at to complement his service and she acknowledged that he always had a great attitude. I would come back for that alone!",

The fries were good, but the cheesesteak was pretty abysmal. It would have been OK if it weren't for the fact that the roll was separated (or maybe so soggy it fell apart) on the bottom, and it just made eating it really difficult. That plus it was very greasy just made it a meh experience.   I was also expecting dirt cheap, but 8.99 for a bad cheesesteak is way too much.

Compared to another Cafe, located at a point somewhere south, the service and food quality is substantially better and it's located closer to the Vegas Strip off of Flamingo @ The Tuscany. Recommended spot to go to after the club.  JuL's Tips * Dollar extra to add mushrooms or cheese to your eggs. * Gets busy on weekends (Naturally because of clubs) Don't be shy to wave down a server if you need something they are nice. * After 5am you'll have to wait til 6am for $8.99 Steak & Egg special which runs til 11am. * Food taste better when you're drunk.",

Apparently our new table was in a different waiters zone, but out old waiter (who had not given us anything other than the menus) decided to keep serving us. Both waiters kept repeating the other by asking for our drink orders in succession, each unaware of the other. Once they found out there was a slight verbal disagreement as to who would actually serve us. Made for a bit of an awkward experience for us. Our original server, probably not used to serving this table, neglected us a lot, and we found ourselves asking the server for this area for assistance quite often. Our food took tremendously long, almost 30 minutes to come out, and this was at 1pm....  I would come back again for the menu, hopefully service will be better organized next time.",

Pretty basic crab legs that you could get at anywhere. So I decided to skip the AYCE crab legs and try something else.  Order a full rack of BBQ pork ribs. Amazing. Add them to my list of bbq spots. Tender fall off the bone, perfectly cooked, real delicious BBQ sauce. Also came with 2 sides and rolls at your demand, ask for corn bread you'll like them. I forget the price but it was about $13-15. Plenty of ribs to go around.  Steak and egg were ok a bet pricey about $13 regular and $6 during its graveyard special.  The monster burger special is still a good deal at $5 but I guess it wasn't as gourmet as I last thought but still good.  As always excellent service on a busy Friday night.",

If you're a country gravy kinda person (and I mean, who isn't?!) then you'll be a fan of this joint! The pancakes were light and fluffy. Biscuits were as well. Butter served. My dad got a bowl which included a variety of breakfast options tossed in together and has not shut up about it since!

It can get a little busy for the crab legs, so getting a refill on your drink can be a little bit of a challenge sometimes. The staff is nice, though. They will replenish your crab leg supply often, and most of the time before you're done with your last batch. I think it was nice to try once, but since I live across town, I don't think I will need to return. I haven't tried any of the other food, so I don't know if it's any good.",

The hostess tried to sit us at a couple messy tables and then found one that had a Bobby pin on it. Apparently she was puzzled that I found that gross.

The steak wasn't even that great... it was the most basic-tasting steak I've ever had. Absolutely nothing fabulous. None of the people who work there are articulate, I could barely understand what my waiter was saying. It's real cheap, I'll give it that, but the service and food is very subpar.

This is clearly a blessing to late night partiers and midnight snackers alike. It was so great to enjoy a hearty sit down breakfast at 4 am after not having time to eat a proper meal all day. It's slightly off the beaten path of the Strip, but not too far to be inconvenient.  The food itself was average at best, but it was so cheap that it didn't really matter to me. If you care about the quality, then maybe you're better off going elsewhere. My steak had a lot of gristle on it that I had to cut off. The other elements (eggs, hash browns, toast) are hard to mess up so those were fine. I think the quality is comparable to normal diner food. My friend ordered a basket of calamari and it was not good, but then why would you get calamari at a diner?   Service was polite and quick given the hour. This is a great spot for late night comfort food, good and simple.  Food: 2.5, Service: 3, Environment: 4, Price: 5",

Service flat out suck. We waited over 40 mins for our food, when it was served it came out cold. We ask for the manager and was another waiter came to assist. We were told we could warm your food in the microwave. Tara the manager finally came out to speak with us. We were told by Tara that they were very busy And short staff. And she could reheat our food up in the microwave. That was the best she could do. We decided to keep the cold food but still never received any of the condiments, such as jelly or syrup. Poor customer service.",

We went last Friday, the service was horrible. I asked for a pound and 3/4 (since you can get 3/4 more for $9.99) I was asked, \"Are you sure about that?\" Yes I'm sure. I wouldn't have asked. I said never mind I'll just take the pound. Before this even was ordered we were sat down and someone asked what drinks we wanted. Then the waiter who really should learn some personality waited on the couple that came in after us. Icing on the cake was we repeatedly had to keep having my husbands drink refilled, yet the couple who came in after us was being waited on hand and foot. Won't be back for a while. Value is awful now and it just wasn't fun.",

    "text": "Weather in a Friday for the all-you-can-eat crab as I have done for the past 8 years.  Or the crab was not aware it was a $19.95 1 lb special.  the waiter did not alert me to that, because I was ignoring the six by five flyer on the table hidden in the condiment holder.    Crab came out cold and would not break cleanly.  I thought I would plow for this one and ask for hot crab for the next plate.  If I had known it was a $20 plate of crab I would have sent it back.  Ended up ordering a second dinner of chicken cordon bleu.  Much smaller than usual it was previously served as a large portion now it is 2 frozen pucks of deep fried breaded turkey and ham.  my out-of-town friend who had coached into arriving Friday night instead of Saturday morning was also disappointed with his order of crab.  He ordered a New York strip steak of which that was also disappointing.  the best thing on his plate was the yam with butter and brown sugar.    Even the nice plump cornbread of several months ago is now very limited and you only get 4 small slices.    It is apparent that they have cut back on portions, are charging for extra ranch or anything that's not on the table services poor -my water glass sat empty several times. I had to waive down the waiter three times to get attention when he was walking by with eyes straight ahead.  Empty plates and serving utensils stayed on the table until we left waiting for them to be picked up as our second dinners came.    overall it went from one of my favorite place to take out-of-towners to some place I will now avoid to eat.  I hope that the lounge is still a reasonable place but I now doubt it.",

Probably the best $6 dollars you will spend in Vegas.

Get the sourdough, slab some butter and strawberry jam.. so freaking food. (they put butter on it already, but if you want more butter). The servers are amazing and hospitable, even though they probably see a bajillion drunk people every night. The only thing is that sometime it takes a while for the food to come out.

The Canadian bacon had a rancid oil taste, yuck and the hollandaise sauce wasn't good either. I prefer my hubby's version, yum! Not to mention their coffee was too strong. Slow service, and our waitress showed no care either.  I guess you get what you pay for, but if you really want cheap eats for breakfast in Vegas I'd go with Ellis Island.",

Note, this pricing only applies after 1am or something super late like that, but hey, it's perfect for those after-clubbing munchies. I've never ordered anything else here.  My steak is always cooked perfectly medium rare. The one at Ellis Island is always overdone. I get my eggs sunny side up with runny yolk. Sourdough toast, which they spread melted butter all over. You don't even need the jam that they give you. And then hash browns to round it all out. Some places give you fried potatoes, which is just not the same.   Located inside Tuscany Suites, which is only a few blocks away from the Strip. Open 24 hours, for obvious reasons. Never a wait. Seriously can't beat that!",

She said we didnt pay the check. Everyone had separate checks and the 3 of us standing there had just come from the register. So she describes the person who didn't pay. And I told her are u sure? She was at the cash register. SO the waitress sends security to get her in the parking lot. They bring her to the cash register and she tells them I paid IN CASH and pointed at the cashier that was there. So they don't believe her and the waitress is freaking out. My friend asks if there are cameras because she paid. The cashier suddenly remembers that yes she paid but she was busy and put the money aside. So my friend us like soooo are we good? Everyone is like oh ok. No apology. The manager said we had to investigate. NO APOLOGY. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? NOTHING. BEWARE OF EATING HERE. MAKE SURE U GET A RECEIPT WHEN YOU PAY.

    "text": "While some Vegas hotel-casinos are known for their grandiose buffets, others are more known for their cheap, late-night steak & eggs specials. Marilyn's is an unassuming diner found within the Tuscany casino. Open 24 hours a day, this special only runs midnight to 6:00 am and is off menu.   Looking back at reviews from a few years ago, the price of the steak & eggs special has been steadily increasing by about a dollar a year. It was $3.99 back in 2011-12, $4.99 in 2013, and now currently $5.99. Still, it's a cheap deal for a 6 oz. NY strip (see what they did there?), 2 eggs any style, hash browns, and toast (wheat, rye, or sourdough). Don't expect too much because the steak isn't like Lawry's across the street, but it'll do for late-night eats.   The best tip I can offer is to order the steak one level rarer than what you usually get. I once received a well-done steak after ordering a medium-rare. My rare order last night came out a decent medium-rare.",

ATMOSPHERE: Has that denny's/ihop feel to it but we got a big booth for 8 of us and were seated right away.  FOOD: Coming at 2:30am they had the steak and eggs special.  I didn't see it on the menu but just ask for it and the waiter will get it for you.  I think it was $4.99 or $5.99 but either way very cheap.  Ask for it more rare than you normally order it because it is pretty thin and they tend to overcook the meat.  I got medium rare and it was only pink.    The platter comes with steak, 2 eggs, hash browns and 4 pieces of toast (you can choose).  I got the eggs over easy and they were runny but not gross.  I got sourdough toast, where they put the butter on it for you and it was SO GOOD.  The hash browns were tasty, not bland and hard but still hot and crispy.  The steak was OK, as you can imagine for such a cheap price, but the flavoring wasn't bad.  It was just slightly tough.  Overall, definitely a must for your trip to Vegas.",

The staff was on point. While one hostess was helping a customer paying the bill at the register, another one saw us to get us seated at a table. They seem to work well together noticing when refills were needed for beverages. I like that my chicken and waffles were tenders.

I made the regretful choice of picking dinner (I really love breakfast food). I opted for chicken cordon bleu with a side of mac and cheese and broccoli. I had my doubts about ordering the chicken cordon bleu and I really should have stayed away  and stuck with breakfast. I'm 85% sure my entree was fried along side my friend's chicken tenders. I could hold the chicken breast in my hand and it wouldn't fall apart. The mac n cheese wasn't anything special and the broccoli was standard.   Despite an uneventful dinner, we still ordered dessert. We knew what we were getting into defrosted dessert pies. They were about $5 each and didn't taste the price. The dessert was $3 less than the entree.   Overall, if I was stuck in the area again and wanted a cheap meal, I'd probably go back. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",

We all ordered medium rare and each of our steaks came out...MEDIUM RARE!  We all ordered a variety of eggs and it come out just right, my over easy wasn't over cooked and was served with a runny yolk right when I dug my fork into the guy. Wheat toast was toasted to a nice toast & buttered just right. The last piece though...it was drowning in butter where it wasn't melted completely and it was amazing!   Service was super nice. We came in pretty late right when we got to Vegas and they seated us right away and the waitress was a doll.",

When we got here I can already see they were busy and understaffed. Took 10 minutes for someone to come up to us and greet us, by then we were already set on the steak and egg deal that I thought was $4.99.   Steak and eggs was nothing  extraordinary, Norms is much better than what I was served. They over buttered my English muffins to the point where I scraped a few good chunks off. The steak was asked for medium rare and was over cooked to well. It was decent but nothing to get excited over. Had to use hot sauce and salt for more flavor. I ordered my eggs over medium since I love it runny and that was surprisingly cooked perfectly. I like combining it with the steak or hash brown, it helps give different texture. Eventually we finished our meal but service was no where to be found for a refill of water. I just grabbed my sister's water and finished it. Eventually we flagged our waiter to get the check and paid our way.",

I would say this is the best late night 'steak and eggs' deal in town. (12am - 5am) The steak for a $6 dollar plate is surprisingly high in quality. Their bbq chicken and ribs special is always a hit, and they also have all you can eat crab legs on Friday nights (ends at 10pm). The staff is very nice, although service can be quite slow sometimes.  They do not do the steak and eggs special to go, and they only do call in orders if you are a guest at the Tuscany.   Grant it this is not a high place for fine dining (or even modern fast casual), they seem to deliver every time when one is look for a bite to eat.",

So no matter what time of day it is, you can get some decent food that isn't way over priced.  The first visit was for brunch and I have to say their breakfast food is better than their lunch or dinner. I believe breakfast is served all day is the option is always there. For lunch I ordered their prime rib dip with a side of fries. And like I said, it's alright. Their margarita pizza had no basil on it so I have to say I was quite disappointed with that one.  Our servers were nice and honestly I didn't mind coming here everyday since it was so convenient. Would stay here again.",

    "text": "Hailing from the land of the San Gabriel Valley, aka The SGV, where late night cafes were O'plenty... There is place know as ABC Cafe which WAS formerly home to the only $5.99 Steak and Eggs I have known to be in existence... And then they raised their price to $8.99 Which is ludicrous because you know that steak served with frozen veggies and fake instant mashed potatoes ain't worth that damn price... Until LDW '14 my world was about the change.  I've heard many stories of \"The Steak and Eggs of Tuscany Suites\"... And finally got to experience th for myself this Labor Day Weekend! After night at the nightclub, this was the brightest of ideas to pop into our semi-sober minds! To my astonishment the fabled Steak and Eggs were located at Marilyn's Cafe inside of Tuscany Suites! Stayed there on several occasions and in retrospect, am ashamed I did not take advantage of this when staying only minutes walk from where we stayed.  We were seated immediately and got straight to business! Majority of us went straight for the meal of stories while others went for the Spaghetti and Meatballs which was advertised on the board when walking in.   Once the meals were out and it was finally right before my eyes, I was in amazement of the quality cut of beef they used. Cooked medium rare, just the way I liked it. This was hands down wayyyy under priced! Quality was way better than any steak you would get at any Denny's or Applebee's for 1/2 the price. Me being a good friend... I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality late night meal!   Oh and don't bother trying anything else... That good. The spaghetti and meatballs aren't anything worth mentioning... But until next time! When the 250 miles are no longer between me and my tastebuds. My wallet will miss you in the meantime.",

They were standard: somewhat dry, very fried, and not something you can quite eat without the assistance of sauces to lessen the scratching of the overly brittled flesh scraping at the inside of your esophagus.  Mac and cheese was dry as well, mushy, and probably has been sitting under the salamander most of today. I suspect it was gingerly microwaved before it brought to us.  Fries: probably the best thing. Crispy enough, well seasoned (which the mac and cheese cannot equally boast), and quick to disappear off of the surface of my plate. Finally dessert: I had the oreo creme cake and my lovely companion had a turtle cheesecake. The oreo creme cake had unfortunately long sucked in the very distinct taste of freezer and was likewise quite cloying (especially with the addition of a saccharine chocolate syrup on the plate for 'decoration'). Turtle cheesecake tasted less like freezer. It was the better of the two for sure.  Overall what we expected. Not a place you're eager to return to.",

We are pretty picky about food so while the food wasn't as seasoned as fancy as we are used too, when you added salt and pepper it was pretty tasty. Had the prime rib, mashed potatoes and spinach.  The price was only $13.99!  Husband had the pork chops and they were cooked like he asked. Didn't have any desert but the tray looked pretty enticing.",

On a side note, this same breakfast is offered for $8.95 outside of Rodeo week in December and the difference is that you can swap toast for pancakes.  For he Cowboys special I had a Steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, toast and coffee...all for $7.95plus tax.  Amazing value.  Delicious breakfast.  Jose was our server.  Jose is a class act and truly kind gentleman offering excellent service.  Highly recommend this spot for breakfast in Las Vegas.  Open 24 hours.  Tuscany is a great value place to stay as well if looking for a place off the strip at a great price.",

    "text": "I have always liked Marilyn's Cafe.  The atmosphere is quiet and secluded from the rest of the Casino (The Tuscany).  I have never had any major problems here and I don't foresee any in the future.  Breakfast anytime you want it... cheap eats... and good service, what else do you want?  Here is my review from my last visit:   - We walk up to the counter and we were seated right away.   - Our drink order was taken and brought out promptly.   - The waitress came over and took our order.      * Side note: I am not one that is really picky but, I eat Ultra Low Carb throughout the week.  So, I ordered a burger with no bun and instead of fries, I asked for a side of bacon.  Of course my friends gave me a little grief - as good friends do from time to time.  Or, in my case, all of the time.    Anyhow, she, said it she'll look into it.  It turned out to be no problem and I was charged the regular price.   - We had ample time between our courses.  So, there was no rushing through the salad / soup because our main meal was on it's way out.   - Our drinks were always full.   - We were checked up on periodically.     - She gave us the desert pitch before handing us our bill.    This is the type of service I want and expect when I choose to eat out.  So, with all of that said, it was a pretty good experience to just hang out with a couple of friends and have a pretty decent meal.",

A very warm and inviting atmosphere with a good view of the casino. It's a casual dinner witch is always a plus and also does room service for the hotel.   Avoid a-la-carte items as these appeared a little heavy to me for a dinner. However the special menus(daily and lunch were VERY attractive.  The prime rib was sensational. Something I'd expect out of a higher end steak house. I asked for it rare and got it that way which was very pleasing. The horseradish was a nice balance of spivey and flavor. The greens and mashed potatoes were fresh and cooked just right.   The service was just as good as the food and I'll probably be back a few more times this week!",

    "text": "I've been here about 3 times, but it seems that each time is less memorable than the previous visit.  It's a good deal for the crab, but in my opinion there are so many options in Vegas that surpass Marilyn's Cafe.  Pros:     *  There's an AYCE crab feast for $15.98 per person on Friday nights   *  the AYCE option comes with 2 side dishes    *  Free refills on drinks    *  Service was pretty good.  The manager of the restaurant even came by.   *  Quality of the crab itself was mediocre  Cons:   *  Outdated ambiance   *  No refills on your sides   *  Slow service   *  Raised the price on the AYCE option (previously $12.99)   *  It was cold throughout the restaurant.  Overall:   Since the last time I went here, it seems that they have boosted up the price a bit on the AYCE.  That was the main thing that Marilyn's Cafe had going for them was the crab at a killer price.  Since it's a bit more expensive now (in comparison to before), there are other places throughout the valley that offer AYCE for a little more money (way better quality though and more for your money too).  It also doesn't help that was extremely chilly inside the restaurant.  It made my meal less enjoyable.  I live in the Northwest side of town and it's always a pain to get to Tuscany Suites from home (especially on a Friday night).  I do not think I'll be coming here for their AYCE crab anytime soon.  Perhaps on another night for their regular menu, but I have yet to try that.  I'll definitely update my review once I do though.  From reading other reviews, it seems like they have some other good deals that are worth checking out (such as the Steak and Egss for $3.99... unless they changed the price on that too?)  Tips:   *  Make sure to check out the menu for all the other days.  Different days = different specials   *  Bring something warm to wear.  It was very cold in there.   *  You have to walk out of the restaurant to use the restroom, but its right around the corner.",

Each steak was 6 oz, came with hashbrowns, choice of bread (I got sourdough), and eggs (I got egg whites).  The price is the best part of the meal. Single order is $3.99. The steak is definitely no Prime cut Ribeye but what do you expect? I ordered medium-rare. One of the steaks was right on but the second one was well-done. I think it got mixed up with my buddy's 2 steaks. So, the food was pretty good but the price is why I gave it 4 stars.",

The first morning we just needed a quick bite before we started the day with some friends so we worked our way down to the cafe in the hotel l. Luckily I decided to take a look at the menu before we were seated because the prices were way out of line.  A standard 2 egg, toast, bacon and coffee breakfast would have run about $13 each.  I figure that this is Vegas baby and I want a cheap steak and egg breakfast with all the trimmings for under $10. We then stopped by the buffet and found that the Friday morning breakfast buffet cost was over $20 each! What happened to cheap eats at the casinos? Needless to say we walked out and found McDonalds next door and had a quick cheap fast food meal for under $10 for the both of us which was much more to what we really were looking for. The next morning, after a late night out of fun and drinking we wanted a good sit down breakfast but again we didn't want to over pay by double so since I did have a car I figured I would yelp some local breakfast joints.  There were many but for some reason Marilyn's really stood out to us.  It was close, had tons of great reviews and it just sounded like exactly what we were looking for. Marilyn's is located at the Tuscany suites on Flamingo inside the small casino. Parking was a breeze and since the casino was very small we weren't too far from it when we walked in the front door. We got there around 10:30am and found it was perfect timing because we got a booth right away and the place was packed about 30 minutes later and had people waiting for a table by time we left just after 12. The menu was varied and you can choose breakfast, lunch or dinner anytime but we opted for breakfast.  I had the 2 pork chops and eggs any style that was served with has browns and toast which I subbed out for a biscuit. The  pork chops were thick sliced, center cut and cooked to perfection, the hash browns were crispy, the eggs were perfectly cooked to over easy with the whites cooked all the way through and the yolk runny and the biscuit was nice and flakey. My wife had a ham and cheese omelet  that was very tasty and also came with all the standard breakfast trimmings.  I noticed that they do offer a $4.99 steak and egg deal that is served midnight to 5 or 6am and then goes up a couple of bucks after that until I think noon and then goes up a couple of dollars more. We enjoyed our breakfast so much that we took our friends there after midnight on Saturday night and we all had the steak and egg special that is the perfect nightcap to a night of drinking dancing and gambling! I highly recommend Marilyn's for any meal and will go back next time I'm in town.",

It certainly isn't the service -- it's absolutely ridiculous how terrible the service has been here. In fact, there was one time among the twenty other times we've dined here when we were waited on by a lady who received a 100% tip from us, and all she did was do her job. That's it. It was just such a pleasant change for us, we decided to let her know. A lot.  The graveyard breakfast specials aren't bad, and the price is outrageously cheap. Steak 'n eggs, taters, and toast -- $2.99. Pancakes or two eggs 'n toast -- $0.99.  Perfect place to go after a night on the town. Just, like I said, be patient with the servers.",

The food isn't too bad, but the price and it being open 24 hours is what makes this place so nice. I stayed at the hotel, so it was pretty convenient for me to eat here. The staff here is nice, even though I was probably a drunken fool.",

    "text": "Just ate dinner here after checking in at the hotel and receiving a 2 for 1 coupon.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak.  It came with two sides (I chose cauliflower and mashed potatoes with gravy) and a bread basket with real butter.  I must say, I thought the food was very good and the portions were large.  I got the club sandwich and cole slaw to go for another meal, since there's a refridgerator in the room to keep it cold.  My waitress was exceptional.  She was extremely pleasant, polite, and courteous.  One of the very best I've had the pleasure of being served by.  I wish I'd remembered her name so I could give her credit.  I don't have a single complaint.  I would have to recommend this diner for anyone looking for a good meal at a reasonable cost.",
