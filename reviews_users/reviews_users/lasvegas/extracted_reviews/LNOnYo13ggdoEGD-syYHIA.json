The gyro was good (not great).  Standard selections in other selections were like a typical buffet (Chinese, Mexican, Italian, etc...).  A few good options were the sweet & sour fish, the meatballs, the fried shrimp, and carving station.  Most other choices not good like beef & broccoli, fried catfish, and tamales.  Kids liked the ice cream (not soft serve), different options like cookies & cream and mint chip.  The apple cobbler was terrible.  Wouldn't recommend for the price, maybe a better option for breakfast or lunch for a cheaper price.",

I do agree with my sister that it's not as good as it used to be but still great for the price. We had a late lunch/early dinner and there was prime rib, pasta, chicken, salad, veggies, fruit, potatoes, ice cream, cheesecake, cake, cookies, and more! My favorite dish they had was the linguine and clams. There's also an Asian station and noodle bar. Unfortunately, the noodles they use now are really thin and fall apart easily. They used to have the thick chow mein but they got rid of it. They really need to bring it back! I also miss the crab legs which have now been replaced with fruit. :( Overall, a pretty good experience with excellent service and lots of food options to choose from.",

I got a 2 for 1 deal in the mail, so my husband and I decided to check it out and now I am sorry we did. The staff was okay and the person bringing us drinks was prompt, but it seems like everyone was in a bad mood and no one was happy to be working there. I should have taken a few cues while waiting in line when one employee brought another one prepackaged snacks to eat because obviously they don't trust the food either and that most of the patrons were twice my age probably just here to use their players points/coupons. I had items mostly from the asian section. Sweet sour chicken had a texture that wasn't chicken and had obviously been sitting out for waaaayyyy to long. Vegetable spring rolls were just mush. I couldn't finish the bbq rib as it was mostly fat. Pot stickers were ok but cold. In fact, none of the food was hot. About the only thing that has half way decent was the fried shrimp which was more batter than shrimp. I had a piece of sausage from the carving station which was more like a glorified hotdog. Fried catfish had lots of skin hidden under the batter. I decided that I was over the dinner selection and went to desserts. Eclairs were ok, but dried out. The sugarfree cheesecake had hardly any taste to it. I'm glad we only paid half price and we won't be back until the food quality improves.",

If you've gone to the higher end buffets (also much higher priced) like Aria, Cosmo (Wicked Spoon), even Paris, Planet Hollywood, and Mirage GVR generally doesn't compare, but if you're just looking for a nice, clean, good quality standard fare buffet (breakfast, lunch, OR dinner), GVR is at the top of the list.  I haven't been to Red Rock's buffet yet, but I understand it to be comparable. I'll review that one when I go later this year, but in the mean time, GVR is a safe bet.",

The price with Boarding Pass was $12.99, and there wasn't a wait.  The most memorable items I had were cream of broccoli soup, mozzerella & tomato salad , fried shrimp and pretzel rolls. The pretzel rolls are seasonal items for Oktoberfest. There are stations with American, Asian, Italian and Mexican food. The cold salads have a great variety also, including Caesar and spring lettuce w/ cranberries, walnuts, & bleu cheese.  Desserts include the standard pies & cakes, and a variety of ice cream. The bread pudding is a standout.",

It's not the greatest quality of food but for the price, it is more than decent. I actually preferred breakfast over dinner.  At breakfast time, you can build your omelet. It tasted pretty good and was very cheesy. There's even cereal!   You even get unlimited drinks! Our server was really nice and got us every drink my group wanted.

The food is OK. If you don't have coupons, you get a discount with your Station card. They allow two people per card. Friday is seafood night $27.99 and Saturday is prime rib and shrimp night $17.99. Otherwise dinner is $14.99 with $9.99 and $7.99 for lunch and breakfast respectively.  I hit up the carving station, the pasta station (you can choose your pasta and sauce) when available, the Mongolian grill, and the dessert station. I usually don't touch the pizza, Mexican, or Asian stations.  Our last visit was on Easter Sunday and it actually was not that busy. They'll usually run special prices and selections on holidays. This year they offered prime rib and lamb on the carving station. And they opened a lamb gyro station. Price was $22. We waited five minutes at the most for our party of 8 around 6 PM, but this was definitely an exception. Expect a lengthy wait sometimes, especially on weekends and holidays.  We'll come here on weeknights when my wife or I aren't in the mood to cook for 5. If it was just my wife and I, or me and my buddies, I'd probably offer that we pay more, make the drive, and head to the Strip.",

Came on a Wednesday around 2:30 pm. We waited quite a long time for mid week perhaps 35 minutes. For my first round I got mash potatoes, alfredo pasta, sausage. I took a bite of each and  didn't even finish one section of my plate, I set it aside and went for round 2 hoping I'd find something better.  So second round I head to the custom noodle grill. I concocted a bowl of garlic, mushrooms with just oyster sauce and beef. The cooks were friendly but I only wanted a small portion hence myself creating my bowl of ingredients. The ratio between the amount of ingredients and beef were ridiculous it was like a 1 whole bowl of beef to half amount of noodle and toppings. While I love huge portions of meat when getting something ala carte like a sandwich but lets keep in mind we are at a buffet. I felt like the beef was too much and it was a waste, food cost wise for the business and for customer.  The service was good but I wasn't impressed with anything.",

Not all station feast buffets are created equal..... trust me....  Why do I like this place?  Let me tell you...  1)  Awesome Asian cuisine selection...   Love their Eggplants, Mabo Tofu, and most of all, Chinese BBQ pork!  (Be sure to get those ones that has a little bit of fat on it!)  So good!!!   2)  Pretty tasty Italian section... meatball were my favorites and the Alfredo sauce was pretty creamy too!  3)  Pretty good selections from Mexican, American, and pizzas!  But I never get to try those because I'm so addicted to the eggplants and the BBQ pork....  4)  Nice salad bar!  Caesar salad here is soooo much better than souplantation's  5)  Nice Dessert Section with various pies and cookies..  (And NSA choices as well)  Cold goodies are gelatos in 6-7 flavors....  Weekday lunch is only $9.99.. the most expensive meal is the Friday night Seafood running at $27.99 (but as expected because it's seafood)  All other times are less than $15 bucks easy even dinner.....  Here is a great tip for you all!  Before leaving...  Be sure to stop by the gelato, ask for your favorite flavor shake!  YES!! Pick your favorite gelato and the nice staff will make you a delicious ice cream shake in no time!  We love our espresso and Pistachio flavor shakes!  This is a hidden secret of sorts... but don't say I never share any goodies with you all!",

One thing I noticed that I liked right away was the fact that they now have antibacterial stations for your to clean your hands before moving on.  Unfortunately there are a LOT of people who wait in line outside to get in and touch everything there is to touch and then go straight for the plates without thinking about sterilizing their hands from everything they touched before they came in and then they touch all the tongs which sometimes that part of the handle touches the food and oh well.  It comes with the risk of coming to a buffet.  This buffet was ok, being Veterans day, we only had to pay $10.80 so it was worth the price of admission.    This does not seem to be an overly priced buffet and the selection is good.  We saw some items like baked chicken as well as fried, so you did have a choice between bad and really bad.  Why bad, because I am sure that nothing there was organic, so you were taking another risk once you get past the germs people put on the serving spoons because not everyone thinks to disinfect their hands from everything they touched while waiting in line.  Overall it was good and worth the price.",

You can't go wrong with 11 plates of crab legs, 3 plates of shrimp, another plate of miscellaneous seafood, and a...wait for it...wait for it...diet coke. Well, if you did eat all of that you'll end up in the ER or praying to the porcelain gods all night in one fashion or another. I love their seafood offerings on Friday night and generally only go to this buffet then. The only problem is the line. If you're not there before 5:30pm be prepared to wait  a good hour.  Outside one of the big two buffets (those being the M and Bacchanal for me) they have one of the best dessert options in the buffet world. You can get hand scooped ice cream and they're kind enough to make milkshakes or malts.  A few buffet rules I'd like to point out: 1.) Don't eat in line, I promise, your food won't jump off the plate. 2.) It's not necessary to make that face when you don't like that specific offering, it's possible I do, or I did until I saw the way you reacted. 3.) THEY WON'T RUN OUT OF FOOD 4.) 60 minute time limit, tops.",

Pricing is good though, and there are 2 for 1 deals out there- three of us dined for $30 and change.  There was a good wait for a Sunday night at 5:30PM but the line went relatively quick. Was disappointed to see that the sushi selection was very small and consisted of cucumber and California rolls-- and when the meager amount was depleted, we were informed they were out for the day. At 6:15PM. Seriously?  Didn't have as many options as RedRock, which others have compared this buffet to. The Chinese/stir fry options were good- HUGE shrimp, for one. Lots of Mexican options but they were rather poorly done. Carving station had roastbeef but it was tough and difficult to cut with the provided butter knife. Dessert options were very odd- froyo and gelato available and several fresh-looking cakes/pies, but the cookies were clearly store-bought and did not look appealing at all. Fresh-baked cookies are my kryptonite, and I was super bummed to see this.   The majority of what I ate was peel and eat shrimp- it's at the Farmers Market salad bar area, FYI. Also, if you go to the tomato-mozzarella salad and just pick out all the mozzarella balls, there is a special place in hell reserved just for you. Don't do it!",

But the real gem here is the dessert section...remember to leave room so you can indulge in the ice cream, milkshakes and a variety of pies and cakes.

Okay that being said about the food let me tell you why I'm giving this place two stars, not cause of the food but because of the shady business practices, they add gratuity to your bill, but I still decided to give then extra top at the counter before you get sat, after being sat and our drink order was taken they took my receipt and then shortly returned with a new receipt, where the gratuity and total line were blank.... So not only did they get service charge and extra top from me but they had the audacity to try and trick me to give them more tip, I have worked in the restaurant business my whole life I have seen this trick before and I do not approve of their shady business practices",

    "text": "Did the dinner buffet as guests of Las Vegas residents. I'm not a fan of buffets. Too many choices. Too much waste. I perused the different stations that featured different ethnic/regional foods. I love sushi and while there were three different kinds of rolls, they were meh. The Mongolian station was wonderful. Select your fresh veggies, noodles, meats and sauces and watch the chef grill it to order. The char siu ribs at the Asian station were delicious but a little on the dry side. Huge selection of desserts including soft serve, ice creams and a bread pudding station. Overwhelmed not only by the choices but by the amount of food. There were some serious eaters there, some in wheelchairs, others tethered to oxygen tanks. I enjoyed my ribs and Mongolian entree. All the other stuff was just way too much. First trip to Vegas/Nevada. I guess it's customary to experience one of its buffets. Did. Done.",

The sausage, bacon and hash browns are good.  They have an omelet station but it looked like the wait was long.  Skip the eggs Benedict, they had a funny taste.  They didn't have the \"expensive\" items like roast beef or lox for breakfast.  Ketchup was never at the table and we always had to ask for it. They have separate lines for hotel guest and players to avoid the crowds. Players also get a discount. The servers were nice and got our drinks quickly.",

We were somewhat surprised at her answer and asked if customer satisfaction was her primary concern, and she coldly replied \"NO\" .  Needless to say, we will not return and advise all others to avoid disappointment as well. Go to Sunset Station or SouthPoint or The M, they are nearby and do care about customers.",

I brought my Boyfriend here for the first time, and he LOOVED IT...we ended up staying past its closing time...hehe!  Note:  Stick with the sauteed Crab legs (and shrimp) - Also, ask for \"Everything & Spicy\"  (its not really spicy, but you get a LOT of flavor when you ask for everything...)  If you don't try the Sauteed Crab legs and Shrimp, there is no need to come here because you can basically find everything else at any other buffet.  Also, the staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  It is one of the best services I've gotten.  There was no need to ask for more napkins, soda, utensils...it was all brought to the table before you even thought about asking for more...",

The lunch buffet was $6.99 (including your drink). How can anyone not like this price? Prices are lowered for the month of January but that would mean no crab legs, which is fine since I don't care much for them.  They have a great selection of different kinds of foods I didn't even know where to start. They offer your traditional American food as well as Italian, Mexican and Asian. I believe there's a salad section but I didn't get a chance to check it out. The desserts were my favorite section and it's also the largest :) They have so many different kinds of cakes and pies, cookies, muffins and ice cream.  The service has been great. The waitstaff would always check on us and make sure our drinks are refilled. I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "Having been to the same buffet in Vegas over and over again, I decided to take a local's advice to eat some place new.  The Feast Around The World Buffet is located inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino, just a short drive from the strip.  For the 21 and over kids, before going to the buffet make sure you stop by the rewards club and sign yourself up for their players' club card.  Present your new rewards card at the buffet and save each person $2.00.  Plus they will give you $3.00 free to gamble.  (Right after we ate I won 50 dollars off the $3.00 the casino gave us!)  Being away from the strip I wouldn't expect the casino and the buffet to be filled with bustling Vegas junkies like myself.  And I was right.  The locals were out this Friday evening and the buffet was only at half capacity.  The buffet isn't all that big and doesn't offer as big of a variety as some of you might be used to, especially for Vegas' standards.  However, I thought what they lacked in variety they made up in quality.  I thought the food was well prepared and a buffet with all you can eat snow crab is always a plus!  (They have both hot and cold crab legs!)  I can't think of a buffet that has snow crabs for less than 17 dollars a person.",

You can cook the crab in any style you want.  Every table you passed had crab legs!   The prime rib was really good, juicy and rare like how I like it.  Top up with horseradish and you're good to go!  There was a pasta station and they had linguini and clams.  It was pretty good.    The pizza was delicious and fresh out of the oven.  There were also roased garlic in oil on the side and you could eat that with your pizza.  I actually put some in my salad!    The chinese station was not too bad.  If they have the chicken with the bean paste, go for it.  I've never eaten chicken so tender and with that type of paste before.  They also have char-siu pau.  Yum!  The soup & salad bar was extensive.  I had the split pea soup and ham.  It was pretty good.  For salad, I decided to put one together on my own.  There were some platters with pre-made salads.  Dessert was extensive with an ice-cream bar.  They could even make you milkshakes if you wanted one!  If you sign up for the player card, you can get $2 off your buffet.",

Be sure to pick up a \"Boarding Pass\" player awards card in the casino before getting in line to save you $2.00 per person.    A good selection of foods with salads, desserts, American, Italian, Mexican, Mongolian BBQ, & Chinese/Asian.  Crab legs are now extra per the cashier.  She was a little hard to understand.  I thought she was asking if I wanted frog legs, ugh, not so much. The Mongolian BBQ will cook to order a variety of and the Chinese had the best quality consistency among their offerings.    Definitely worth the drive and a little more refined than the usual Las Vegas Strip Buffet.

    "text": "One of our mainstays on the buffet circuit, mainly due to it being the Station Casino closest to our house (so we get to burn our comps here most often).  Breakfast ($6.99 w/ players card) and lunch ($8.99 w/ players card) are pretty good deals, but get to lunch early if you have to get back to work, since I've seen 30 mins lines for weekday lunches. Dinner is $14-15 depending on the day, and $25 on Friday for more seafood, but honestly I don't think it's as good a deal as breakfast or lunch. One of my pet peeves is that there is no decent bread to be had, not even for brunch. Smoked salmon on toast isn't really my thing.  Being off the strip, traffic and parking is not a problem. Service is hit or miss, depending which server you get, as in most buffets.  The food: Over the last 10 years, the dishes served haven't really changed much. The chinese food that's not breaded is typically pretty good, and as a healthy option, the mongolian bbq cooked to order is nice (specify \"no oil\" !). The pasta station provides some relief from the stuff just sitting out in the warming tray, and occasionally the pizza is really good when it comes out fresh (sometimes the crust is a bit thick for my taste). Some vegetable choices are pretty low on salt and high in butter, but the Collard Greens they had today (not always on the menu) were pretty good. The turkey from the carving station is typically cooked well (unlike Southpoint's), and the dessert area is ok.   Not gourmet food, but for a $9 lunch hard to beat.",

When it comes to the food its just average. its not TERRIBLE but i can relate to a few other reviews. the orange chicken is 100% always too dry. the chicken wings are too sweet, but im assuming because its in the Chinese section that its supposed to be that way. the sushi is absolutely terrible. its like eating rubber. all of the basic foods such as pizza, pasta and deserts are always made well and taste great. i favor the bread pudding when i go there. & i really liked how they added a mix in counter for ice cream. Im giving it 2 stars because, they charged my 2 year old $15 dollars. I think its absolutely ridiculous that they charge for toddlers THAT much. I wrote a \"suggestion\" to the casino directly and received no reply so here i am to warn others. It does say on their website \"under 2 are free\" but what the problem is , is the PRICE. my son ate 5 bites of macaroni and cheese that costs pennies to make but i paid $15 for him to sit there and watch youtube after that. They could do with childrens pricing or raise the \"free\" age. Newsflash, toddlers dont eat like adults. It also kind of confused me as to why on the receipt it says \"kids buffet\" when its the same price as an adult one. why have 2 separate buttons for 1 solid price? I probably will not be going back here again because its still bothering me especially since my son turned 2 just a few days prior to that. One thing i forgot to mention above is when i questioned the pricing, all the lady did was say \" i can bring my manager over if you want \" ... but why? prices are prices and we waited 30 minutes in line to eat not realizing they charged for 2 year olds.",

They have a pretty food variety of dessert and also have a Magolian grill.   If you're in this area and want crab legs, this is the place.

While the food may have good and bad days, what doesn't change is the customer service. These people are miserable and couldn't care less about what you want to say. Talk to a manager and if you're not happy about something, they'll just turn and walk away. Cashiers dramatically slow down 30 minutes before a breakfast/lunch/dinner change, so a giant line forms. Came at 10:15 for breakfast (which ends seating at 10:45) and finally got up to pay at 10:43, and watched the cashier have a personal conversation with sometime else. 2 minutes later, it's 10:45 and she turns and tells my party \"lunch prices\". Really? We just stood in line for 30 minutes and heard what you want to do after you get off? Not happy? \"That's just the way it is. Cash or card?\". Amusingly, Jack the \"manager\" proceeded to seat us, and asked how things were. Obviously we were unhappy and told him what happened - he proceeded to go \"hmm\" and walked off.   Fast forward to the food. Once you get around the maze of walkers and uncontrolled children, you'll get to the food. Now, if you come at a change time, you'll be greeted by \"kitchen managers\" who literally tell you to go away while they finish making the food to change the trays out.   I get there are time limits and rules, but like a number of other people who have wrote reviews, it's not our fault that you don't have cashiers because your staff is guarding the buffet lines like it was a beach in Normandy. I'll go to M next time, and get a much better meal with people who actually care about their jobs and making people happy. Or at least aren't sour about having to come into work today. If you must support a station casino buffet, try the Palms before it slides off a cliff like the rest of their establishments.",

    "text": "This is one of the few buffets that I visit often because it offers a decent inexpensive meal that offers a good variety when we all feel like eating something different.   The buffet is a good size and has an adequate amount of options. Having been there often and on different days of the week, I can say the options don't vary much. I went on a Tuesday for lunch this time around, and my review will focus specifically on this day and time.  Out of all the times I have been here, this had to have been the most disappointing. My first plate I had mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, stuffing, corn on the cob, ham, pork tenderloin, sausage, hushpuppy, and a side of potato salad, orzo salad and a bread roll. The mashed potatoes, or really any of the potatoes I have tried there, are very good and I always go back for more. The mac and cheese and stuffing is no big deal, tastes just like boxed. The corn on the cob is deceiving; it looks like it's flavorful but it's not even sweet, it's more like a mouthful of water. I only took a few bites of the ham because it was too plain. If it had any glaze, it sure didn't taste like it. The pork tenderloin was moist. The sausage is another favorite of mine, it's always cooked just right and never varies. The hushpuppy and bread roll were decent. As for the two salads, the potato one was delicious and flavorful; however, the orzo had an odd texture and did not taste good to me.   The person who accompanied me got meatloaf, fish, meatballs, mini cornbread, and what appeared to be creamed spinach. The only problem was the creamed spinach, which was freezing cold even though it was right in front of the carved meat at the meat station. I don't claim to know much about creamed spinach, but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be cold.   My second plate consisted of pizza, meatball, spaghetti, cheese filled ravioli, baked ziti, lasagna, and a breadstick. All the pastas pretty much tasted the same, although my issue was with the lasagna. Either they put the wrong pasta in the section labeled lasagna or they don't know what lasagna is, because they did not even use lasagna noodles. The sauce was pale and it looked completely unappetizing. The pizza and breadsticks are pretty ordinary, same as all buffets.   The desserts this time were very disappointing. Usually they have a good variety, but this time while they had cookies and cakes, it was the kind of cakes that look pretty but they all taste pretty much the same and I didn't see any cheesecake out. I had a small chocolate cake roll, bread pudding, apple crumble, and a danish. The cake roll was awful- dry and very little chocolate taste. As for the danish, I couldn't even tell if it was strawberry or raspberry or what because the fruit center was so dry. The apple crumble was ok. My favorite was the bread pudding, which I put a little vanilla sauce on, and it reminded me of a mix of flavor between churros and flan. The person accompanying me sampled the sugar free cherry pie and sugar free cake; I tried a piece and there was no flavor at all. They were the worst sugar free desserts I have tried there.   If you're looking for an inexpensive buffet, I think this is a good option, however, keep your expectations low. It's not going to be extraordinary, but you will get plenty of options.",

Only place that had a beef dish was the Mongolian BBQ section but the stir fry was ground beef yuck. Best part of the meal was the hand scooped ice cream that's it. It was only $10 so couldn't expect a great buffet, would I eat there again only if I was desperate and wanted something quick.  Refills on drinks was slow I had to ask every time to get a refill.",

I live across the street and was without a vehicle for several weeks so this was an easy option many time. Honestly I have eaten better food at Golden Corral. I cannot believe these people sleep at night charging $20 for this buffet to non club members. There are so much better options in LV. Everything here comes out of a bag or is deep fried. Get over yourselves GVR you are so underwhelming it's not even funny. Save yourselves the disappointment and just go to Aria or Wynn for a real buffet.",

I haven't been to this buffet in many years and only came in tonight because it was free from a slot promotion. Food very bland,stuffing was cold.. Asian bbq ribs-best item I had tonight. But, the lomaine noodles were hard and undercooked. Salad bar had the usual items-the cesear dressing was above average, and the fruit was ripe and sweet. Save embarrassment if you have relatives in town..wait for the seafood buffet night-- Hopefully the reviews are correct..but from what I have witnessed..be prepared to wait a long time in line !",

    "text": "Came here for the breakfast buffet with my boyfriend. We saw it listed in one of the Worth It videos from Buzzfeed and thought to give it a try. I mean, for the price, how could we not?  Not too much of a variety for breakfast foods. If you're really into the traditional breakfast items like eggs, bacon, ham, omelets, pancakes, waffles, cereal, etc., you'll have no problem here. There were random taco stations, and a dessert station setup, but I mean it was what it was.  Taste of food was average--not horrid, but not fantastical or amazing. My favorite was probably the sliced ham and the bacon. The hash was a little disappointing, but the tacos made up for it. I thought the omelette station was a nice touch, and seemed to be the highlight during this visit as the line was ridiculously long.  I would say that this is a great place to bring a group of people to fill up before hitting the strip to counter some of that booze. Also a good place if you happen to be on travel with your family--saw lots of families eating together while dining. I mean, the price is right, so you can't go terribly wrong with saving some moolah. Just keep in mind that what you pay for is what you get.",

    "text": "Okay so I'm starving, decide to hit the buffet up. I'm waiting and waiting waiting... 45 minutes later finally pay.   Go to the buffet, not impressed. All my food in my first plate was COLD ! Coconut shrimp cold, fried chicken cold, mash potatoes cold. With all the people in here and how long I had to wait (STARVING) and paying 19.99 per person. I half expect the food to be good. Wasn't even that. The cold shrimp they had was SLIMY! Not to mention their so call \"sushi\" had a roll of just tomato and avocado. COME ON PEOPLE, is that even sushi??? Get some better sushi standards.   Wait there's more ! So finally after looking through the buffet I asked for the manager, politely I explained how disappointed I am, after the wait, explained about the cold food etc, he was NOT sympathetic WHAT SO EVER. Did not apologize once ! Just talked on his talkie in his ear and said we'll take care of that.   So whatever, I go back look at the roast beef and decide I'll give this a try, well the guy gives me a huge nasty dry slice of it and I'm done, nothing looks good. Everything is dry and it's obvious they don't rotate their food. Their food quality is terrible and so is their customer service.   The only person who apologize was the cashier when she refunded our money. Teach is own! Never going there again! Want to warn everyone before they waste their money. If there were a no star option this would definitely be it. Thanks for not only wasting my time but having my whole family leave hungry.",

This buffet has very nice Decor that gave the place a lux appeal. We usually like getting a booth but the place was busy so we settled for a table. Which was nice the seats were over sized and comfortable.   Our waitress was great she tended our tables & kept it clean even made sure to keep our drinks filled. We never got the chance to get her name cause she never stopped moving. -great customer service.   The food selection was ok. It had a few more options then the last buffet(the festival buffet @ fiesta casino) So that was a plus. The only thing  I have to complain about the select was they had a very little seafood selection. :/  I think we are done with station casino buffets .",

We lined up at around 10:15am and had to wait about 30 mins, so we were just in the nick of time to get some breakfast food before they cleared out for lunch.  The omelet I ordered was pretty huge, lots of ingredients, and I was able to order egg whites only. The rest of the breakfast food was solid. Then I tried their Chinese section (lunch), it was nice to actually see a Chinese chef cooking the food, and actually, most of it was pretty good! Had a decent dessert section too. I was looking forward to the ice cream, but I'm not sure if their fridge wasn't cool enough or what, but the texture of my ice cream was melted already. But again, for $5, totally worth it. Heck, even for $10 it's not that bad. Our waitress was pretty good too, and kept our drinks refilled.",

    "text": "If you have, a car or any reliable transportation then what are you waiting for. Leave the Strip and head on over (it is only about 15 or so minute drive) to a great buffet! Sure, it isn't the Wynn or even the Cosmo but heck for $18.99 per person you are treated like a Queen (or King, Or Princess).  This is a huge buffet and it clean. The possibilities are endless here. Our host was nice as she took us to our table, and said we could start anytime we wanted to. Drink orders were placed and Minh and I were outta there. Both of us were starving like a marvin and ready to take on this buffet one plate at a time!!   If my mind can remember, (it was an all you can eat extravaganza) there was:  -Crab Legs (Stir Fry is an option here) -Shrimp -Mongolian BBQ -Prime Rib -Turkey -Fried Chicken -Salmon -Grilled veggies -Fresh tortillas -Guacamole and pico de gallo -Shredded pork -Lime rice -Mashed potatoes (and wedged potatoes) -Assorted breads -A salad station (either you could make your own, or they had pre-made salads). -Korean spare ribs  I think I totally carb myself out on this trip. After three plates, I was calling it quits.   After waiting for my food to settle, I went back for desert.... There is not a huge selection sadly but they did have some great tasting treats including sugar free options as well.  -Mini red velvet cupcake (it was ok tasted kind of old) -Various cheesecakes -Lemon Meringue pie -Ice Cream and Gelato -Pie shooters -Fresh fruit with whipped cream  Our waiter was kind as our glasses were re-filled each time without asking, and out plates were cleared by the time we got back to the table.  Leaving the buffet, we were thanked for coming in with a smile. Service you do not see that often anymore!",

    "text": "Not *the* most amazing buffet I've been to, and the line is a little out of control, but it's pretty good...for an omnivore. Now, I'm a vegetarian, and chilled mostly at the nacho bar and mongolian wok, since pretty much everything else had meat it it. However, my partner isn't veggie, and she had a blast, trying a plate of this and that. Her verdict is that the Chinese food is delish, the Italian could use some help and everything else was tasty, but not amazing.  Our service was great, with quick drink refills and plate clearing. I personally was disappointed in the dessert section, as that is what I was saving room for, and found that most of the desserts where too dry, too sweet, or tasted wrong. That said, the little shooters of tapioca and tiramisu were absolutely fabulous.  I might come back, but when they're having the lower prices; for a vegetarian, it isn't worth the super high regular cost.",

The better -SHRIMP (pile a plate of the cold shrimp at the salad section and hand it to the chef so he can stir fry it with all the good sauces/spices. I like hot, so they used all the spices/sauce for me)..I do have to say that they were a little dry..not great quality..but the seasoning/sauce is just soooo good! -milkshakes (hand scooped ice cream with malt based liquid. It's just a regular small milkshake but it does the trick. -mashed potatoes with gravy (brown gravy is salty and good) -ice cream (had mint chip on a cone and it was yum) -pasta (but only when it's RIGHT out of the oven) I had a white cheesy macaroni pasta and a pinkish pasta with tube noodles and based mozzarella cheese right out of the oven and it was pretty good.   Average/OK/Skip -Prime rib (pretty flavorless) -cookies/cupcakes (pretty flavorless) -pork wonton soup (strange taste to it) -green beans (tasted like the frozen/rubbery kind) -corn (just ok) -peas (just ok)  Overall, we paid the $14.99 and I think I ate our money's worth. The pink lemonade was pretty good too but I'm sure it was just run of the mill soda dispenser lemonade. My boyfriend had about 4 servings of prime rib that he said was \"ok\" turkey that he said was \"ok\" and a few other \"OK\" things. He didn't like anything that much. But I want to go back to eat my weight in shrimp! Yay!",

You have your Chinese section on the very right side next to the Mongolian stir fry wok. The middle, right across the salad section is where they had their carving station. You can choose from turkey, kielbasa or meat. The pasta station then pizza is to the left of there, then the dessert section. I love my dessert. But it seemed as if all my selection I got wasn't good at all. The ice cream and banana cream pie I got was bland. I took a bite and I was done with it. Even the ice cream wasn't good and it started melting fast. You really get what you pay for. Want something to eat without a high price tag, you can come here and get full. But don't expect to have high quality food. I'll come back I'm sure since I play at this casino. If I didn't, I most likely wouldn't.",

    "text": "For one of Station Casino's better high-end resorts, this Feast Buffet only gets an average score from me.  The food was highly so-so.  I think since I frequent a bunch of the Station Casino buffets in different locations (hello, Platinum Station card holder!) I could possibly be burnt out by their similar offerings in each of them.  Although I will say Green Valley's Feast does have some uniqueness to it with some different dishes.  The line for this place is usually long, especially on a weekend.  It used to be super-duper long when the BOGO coupons came out a few summers back and there was AYCE crab legs offered.  I think this is when this Feast hit it's peak.  What happened to the seafood extravaganza, Station Casinos?  Bring that shiz back!  Feed us hungry piggies!  Now it's just bordering on the mediocre and meh and blah for me.  It's just doesn't have the appeal that it used to.  We used to drive from the NW part of Las Vegas to go to this buffet.  Now, I'm almost afraid to say I can go to the Santa Fe Station or Texas Station and have a similar experience.  Almost...thankfully.  Green Valley's Feast has just about all the same dishes as any of your typical Station Casino buffets here: American, Chinese, Italian, and Mexican are all represented.  You got your salad bar and your dessert bar...yeah, all practically cloned.  I will give Green Valley's Feast a bit of a leg up here though.  They do have a few things to offer that other Feasts don't.  For one, at dinner they usually cater to the Hawaii resident crowd, serving up some 'almost' authentic Hawaiian food.  They had katsu when I went last time (though a bit dry), and a little whole kalua pig (apple in mouth included) as well.  I say kalua, but I highly doubt this little guy was roasted in ti leaves with Hawaiian salt in an underground imu (aye, oven for you non-Hawaiians).  I've seen a kalua pig before but I stood there people watching anyway because the looks on many a caucasian's face was, well...PRICELESS.  I mean, it was just funny watching their faces of 'OOH' and 'AAH' and 'EEK' from many a passerby.  Hilarious!  Yes, I counted each of the folks I observed staring at this whole roasted pig.  Any yes, majority of them were of the caucasion descent.  But at least the pig went somewhat happy because of the grin of it's little face.  I salute you, oh tiny piggy, as I graciously take from your bountiful belly area.  YUM.  Green Valley's Feast will also let you get a sandwich done on their griddle/stir fry area.  I had a decent Philly Steak and a Reuben on my visit.  Sure beats a burger for a change every once in a while.  The only other thing at this Feast that was a hit for my family was the shake and malt section.  I love me a good malt!  I mean, these weren't high quality, high butterfat malts but at least it was a nice change from all the other gelato stations you see now at all the other Feast buffets.  Myself and my kids enjoyed a shake and a malt each to wash down our dinner.  Plus I might have had a malt to go.  Service is the usual at the Feast, fast but friendly.  I'm glad our server took the time to keep our glasses full even though her section was obviously full that night.  Price is on par with all the other Station Casino Feast buffets.  Visit here if you live on the Henderson side of town otherwise I think you might be ok with going to the one nearest you!  But do go here for the little piggy show!",

    "text": "Green Valley Ranch used to be my favorite buffet in the early 2000's, and really used to pull out all the stops as far as quality in comparison to the other station casino buffets.  I assume it has been because they were bankrupt once, but this casino buffet was so bad when I came on a Friday night that it made Sunset Station, which I normally do not like, look like going to Joel Robuchon.  Gone are all the seafood (they used to be the only place in town that did dungeness crab along with snow crab), no prime rib, just some really tough roast beef.  Everything was just really badly cooked, and that is including the normally reliable steamed broccoli that one can usually get at a station casino buffet.  Priced under 10 bucks for dinner, this might be a good place to feed a huge family.  But the food was so bad, that money would be better spent going to the grocery store and feeding your family good, wholesome food instead of the slop served here.",

The selection is decent and they have spamoni for desert. If you like deals get a players club card and you can eat breakfast for $5.  That said, sometimes the line seems to take forever to move. If you do a teppanyaki they only use ground meat (not good.) I am yet to see a crab leg at the place. They also kick you out between meals. We met for a business lunch and just hung around the table reviewing paperwork (not even drinking soft drinks.) The place was mostly deserted and they came over and told us we had to leave in 5 min. Ok, not eating, not drinking, not preventing anyone else from having a table. We left. I guess they were worried we would pay for lunch and get dinner....gasp! wait, no crab legs, yeah we were not waiting for dinner service.   For the price it is just okay, we usually just go over to Sunset Station or the Rio.",

I didn't even venture to the international stations, so I can't commit on the Asian or Mexican varieties.    The ice cream bar was a nice touch.

    "text": "This place needs to get their act together! My family and I used to love this buffet and it was a real treat coming here for dinner. The waiters have been real lazy lately, they hardly come over to see if we need anything. My mom ordered tea, the guy placed the tea bag on the next table from her and when she asked where it was the waiter acted like she was stupid and flung the dish over to her. He didn't return at all during our sitting until we were getting up to leave and asked if we were okay. I'm standing up getting ready to leave, and now you ask if I'm ok? Wow...  For the past few months now the quality of the food has seriously been lacking!!! I'll describe my most recent experience, because it's enough to get my point across. I went for the Italian section and noticed the pasta was sitting there siting in a pool of water, as if it hadn't been drained (it probably hadn't been) and it seemed like half of it wasn't even cooked well! I took some because I was hungry and figured this was my only option for Italian that night. It was cold!!! Seriously!!! I ended up ordering it from the lady behind the counter since I knew then it would be fresh. That turned out well, thankfully! I also got a couple slices of pepperoni pizza, they were cold so I didn't end up eating them. I decided to go for some Mac n cheese, found that was also cold and tasted disgusting! It seemed like it had been sitting there forever. I ate a garlic stick and called it a meal.  Then it was on to dessert. Man, really they're gonna mess up dessert!!! That's like everyone's favorite part! The dessert was even worse than the entrees. First of all, they only had like 3 cake options available, when they usually have much more selection. Getting someone to help you behind the counter to get more slices out there is like trying to round up a taxi in the middle of the city. They'll even ignore you if you aren't obnoxious enough to yell for them. I usually have to scream for them to come over to help even the nice elderly people patiently waiting. It's really absurd! Well I grabbed the desserts that were available out of the select few, and found most of them were hard and gross, the only thing I could salvage to eat was the pecan pie, which seemed old also and overly sweet.  This is a buffet, I expect to be able to eat well and feel good after. I came home and had the runs from whatever I ended up eating that wasn't good. We paid good money to have a nice dinner, and that was a real poor excuse for a feast! Whoever runs this place needs to get the food quality in order as well as the service!!!",

I don't know why but it's hard to get anyone to cook a steak well done and this place is no different, had him throw one back on the stove twice and it still was raw, so raw that the manager saw me waiting and waiting and came to my seat and saw it was still so bad he said he wouldn't touch it and gave me a comp.

    "text": "How have I lived a mile from this place for 2 years and never tried it?! Big mistake on my part.   Do you love crab legs? This buffet is a crab lovers dream (should specify these are only snow, not king, for all you crab snobs!). Going to go on a limb and say best buffet crabs in VEGAS! Yup, I said it. Skip the Rio, forget waiting in line 2 hours at the M  - freaking go to GVR.   So the magic behind the crab legs is the \"Grill Lady\". Put your plate of crabs in front of her and she will make magic. Butter, Garlic, green onion, and whatever spice level you desire. Crab legs grilled to order? Oh hell yes! I didn't understand how the grilling of the crab legs would increase flavor (they are in shells after all), but damn it works. The flavors permeate the cracks in the shells and turn your boring buffet crab legs into a plate of deliciousness!   Oh did I mention this buffet never has much of a line (15 minutes max!) ? Or that if you just sign up for the Station Card you get $2 off (bringing it to $18.99) PLUS a B1G1 free 1x/month! Yup, our crab magic was only $10 each last night!! Crab legs are 7 days a week for dinner, no need to wait for weekends!   Ok so the bummer is , the rest of the food blows. As I was doing low-carb last night, I didn't get to try much. However my husband did, and yup, it all sucks. The pizza was ok, otherwise not much to write home about.   So if you don't like crab legs, you don't matter anyways - get out of the buffet line and don't take up space on my crab eating tables. For the rest of us sane people, this buffet is an awesome value - and I swear the grill lady will have you hooked !",

    "text": "If you like low end food and enjoy losing weight by experiencing explosive diarrhea, then this is the place for you. The breakfast choices at this casino are limited to the buffet or the crazily overpriced, service challenged, and mediocre at best, Grand Cafe. So the challenge when staying at this hotel is knowing you have to eat breakfast at a sub-par restaurant......so you just eat only enough so that your're not hungry for a while!  Anyway, I and a friend each got sick within minutes of each other shortly after eating breakfast here. I am on guard at this buffet since the last time I ate here I found mold on several of the English Muffins at the toaster. When I reported it to the manager, she said she would report it. She was completely unfazed and unsurprised.  This time I ordered two eggs over easy. The \"cook\", Colin, was unable to handle more than one order at a time, and I got the eggs over hard.....very hard. It wasn't worth complaining since my expectations are already low. My friend got an omelet that was much smaller in size that we'd had in previous visits. Oh....and there were no plates at the omelet on each of the three days I was there.....that was another story! What a joke!  Shortly after eating, the stomach pains started and impacted one full day of a short three day trip. On days two and three, I went back to the buffet for breakfast but would only eat the fruit.  The quality of the food is low - VERY low. One day our server reported that they had \"run out of orange juice\" - at 8:30AM!!!!!!!! The workers are nice enough, but each time Green Valley's managers decide cost cutting in order, it seems that the buffet is the target of their cuts.  I've read other reviews of this place with similar stories of sickness, so I know it's not just me.  It does make you wonder whether or not they  lower the payback percentages on their slot machines too........none of the players would ever know!",

It's a glutton's dream come True, however, a glutton I am not.  My parents are hitting themselves in the head for this, because we would always go to Denny's or IHOP for family breakfast...when all the while, they could have been saving $$ by just coming here!  We don't make that mistake anymore!  However, times they are a changing, so now the buffet price is $6.99.  Still not bad, considering that beverages galore are included!   So sad though, that awhile back, they used to serve these awesome crab legs - Cajun style - with the dinner buffet.  I don't normally like cracking  shells and getting messy with food, but the lady behind the grill always made it taste perfect that she made me want to work for my meal.  I don't know where it went, I heard the Oyster Bar, but idk for sure.   In any case, this Feast Buffet breakfast is good, the lunch, is Okay, and the dinner really isn't worth it without the crab legs. Still, the price can't be beat, and I almost feel like I am robbing them.  Whatever meal you purchase, there would be no problem eating your money's worth here.",

They will cook to order pasta, burritos, stir fry, ice cream shakes and Cajun crab. I didn't get to try the crab, but there were lots of people lining up for it and I imagine that it's like the Boiling Crab. I was disappointed this time because there was no prime rib - the horror!  I keep coming back because I stay at Green Valley Ranch often and get free buffet coupons. I think dinner is around $20, which isn't a bad deal, but I probably wouldn't drive off the strip for it.",

    "text": "I was reminded last night of why I'd only been to this buffet once before. Twice is likely enough too.  This buffet is the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch, and it's similar to the Feast Buffet locations at other Station Casinos. It's also significantly more expensive at $14.99 for dinner w/ Boarding Pass (the players' card, which is free to sign up for) compared to $10.99 at Sunset Station (which is actually much closer to where I live), and with little more to show for it than perhaps some more cooked-to-order options and desserts. It's probably a premium because GVR is branded as a bit of a resort destination compared to the standard Station locations.  Fortunately, my friend treated me with a soon-to-expire free buffet pass. We even bypassed the wait by using the line for President level Boarding Pass cardholders. Perks of having lost a bunch of money via gambling, I suppose.  The food is fairly basic fare, with proteins as fancy as some sort of roast beef, shrimp, and fried fish. I found it odd that they didn't have any sort of baked or more \"healthily\" prepared fish filets, which I see all the time at my preferred Feast Buffet. They do have various made-to-order cooking areas, and I skipped all of them (even the unique Cold Stone-esque ice cream) after recalling how tough the meat was in my bowl ordered at the Mongolian line. Plus, you're expected to tip on all of those.  The best part about a buffet is being able to try a lot of different food, so I took full advantage.  Food that was relatively good: sweet and sour (battered/fried) fish from the Asian area, fried sea bass (somewhat near the meat carving stations), fajitas (if you make sure to use the tortilla to mitigate the saltiness), fried chicken (Asian area), pumpkin ravioli (seasonal Italian selection), \"chef's special\" breaded and fried shrimp (really tiny but good), bread pudding w/ vanilla sauce, apple cobbler (hooray, hot desserts), ice cream.  Food that was just OK: Chinese BBQ pork ribs, Swedish meatball (tasted like Italian meatball but with gravy), shredded lamb (Mexican food station), stuffed pasta shells  Food that was less tolerable: breaded/fried butterfly shrimp (I must've gotten the old batch that had been sitting at the bottom, but that's still not cool), orange chicken (rubbery, yet not crispy), pork tamale (too little meat), menudo (decent tripe but underseasoned soup, couldn't detect any spices/herbs other than chile pepper), chocolate pudding in a cup (trying to aspire to the chocolate mousse at more upscale buffets).  Honorable mention (in mediocrity) for the beef at the carving station for looking so unpalatably gray that I skipped it, for how they ran out of some desserts toward the end of the evening (but still before closing time at 9pm), and for how all of their larger plates are hot (I changed my mind on getting cheesecake for dessert, but my frozen yogurt ended up melting).  I haven't been to this Feast Buffet on one of the special seafood nights (with crab legs reportedly offered), but I still see no reason to try them again when I can find similar if not better offerings at a much cheaper price at my neighborhood Feast Buffet. Well, unless it's my friend treating me for free.",

Tonight I went to the Mongolian bbq area and they prepared me Korean short ribs cooked on a hot plate. Looked good but the meat was so stringy and tough I couldn't eat it. All the other food was so ordinary like any other Vegas \"affordable\" buffet.   Prime rib was tough, calzone pieces were barely edible. There was really not much in seafood. They had deep fried batter with small pieces of shrimp, catfish and peel and eat shrimp. No bueno. For $22 you would expect something decent but it looks like you have to go to the high end $50 buffets in the high roller casinos for a good buffet. Disappointed.",

Pizza although freshly made lack taste. I know this is a casino but when you plead not to be say at arms length by the casino the staff will not accommodate to sit you elsewhere.

Even with the reduced price and on top of it being lunch I don't think it was worth it. Service and staff were excellent but the food was not so good. Underwhelming and not a lot of options even for lunch. Obviously not expecting anything amazing or over-the-top like places on the strip, but in terms of casino buffets I've been to (even in the Midwest) with similar price points this one still falls short.  We went at a pretty normal time for lunch, right before noon. This should be prime time to eat and the food shouldn't have the texture of something that sat under a heat lamp for 10 hours, but it did. Everything was dry/stale and old tasting despite how many people were eating. I just don't understand how it's possible if the food is moving that quickly?? Breadsticks were stale and hard as rocks. Tamales were dry with no flavor and no filling, just masa. One redeeming thing: I ate some mac and cheese that was pretty good, but it still didn't justify us paying buffet costs for one solid item. There were a few other things that we deemed 'okay', as in basically the American station was salvageable but nothing else was, not even the desserts. They were all sickeningly sweet and (SURPRISE) stale. Even the ice cream tasted off.    Looking at the pictures and other reviews I think we would have been better off doing dinner or a brunch here maybe? But lunch left a lot to be desired.",

It's 3:15 and there is no one ANYONE in sight at the cash registers and a long line. 3:25 and someone comes over to say they'll start letting us in at 3:30 because they don't want us to pay lunch prices for dinner. Umm okay. We're all waiting to eat why not just charge us dinner prices and let us in? Dinner doesn't start till 4:00. I can go in eat and be out before then, so why charge me for DINNER? Makes no sense. But I decide you know what I drove all the way over here might as well wait. It's currently 3:46 and no one in sight even remotely making their way to the register.   Let's say even if for SOME reason y'all want to charge extra which is understandable because some people purposely try to pay lunch prices and stay for dinner, why wait an hour before \"dinner\" for you to accept any payment for the buffet.  It's 4:00 and still no one accepting payments for the buffet. I would've been gone if my fiance hadn't taken me here as a surprise date.   Let's just see how the food and service is.  We were the second group in line. We got seated at 4:10 and immediately went to get food. Food was okay. The quality of the food wasn't worth the $25 a person but it's all you can eat so I guess for the quantity it's good. I only really liked dessert tbh. Everything seemed pretty bland.",

    "text": "Tried out this buffet after our LV local friend recommended this place and it did not disappoint.   Before I go on any further with this review, I would like to preface that I had a bad experience with one of the hyped-up on-the-strip buffets and I have always found that buffets that locals usually recommend are usually consistent with good service with a relaxed atmosphere. I also took off a star because with the hype of a lot of Vegas buffets,  Feast's food is more humble and some people can be turned off with that. If you are expecting food with names that are made up by some Francophile, then this is not your place to eat.  Atmosphere and decor of Feast is simple Mediterranean. It is also very clean. The staff was very efficient in seating me and my family. Our waitress was very attentive to us and made sure that drinks were refilled and plates were put away, even to the point that one of my sauce cups were thrown away, even though I wasn't done! It was my fault, though, as I should have not put it in the vicinity of our used plates.   Food, like I said, is not fancy, but humble. It really hits the spot and has a good variety of diversity. Some of the food was rather bland, but it's okay. I think the majority of guests there prefer it that way and you can spice it up a bit with condiments.   There is one specific thing they don't have, which can turn off some parents, which are booster seats. My toddler son usually prefers booster seats and not high chairs. However, they do have high chairs. It's not a huge compromise, but it may be worth noting.   Last, but not least, the prices are really fair! With a player's card, our total came out to less than $20/person and that was for dinner! Our two-year-old got in for free.   Overall a great place to eat! Our local friend steered us to the right direction and my family and I walked out of there happy!",

Things have changed and not for the better. Sunday brunch and everything was either old or cold or dried out. The breakfast items should have been removed if they are not going to keep them fresh. I had some spaghetti because I knew the sauce was hot. My niece got pizza and spaghetti. The Chinese food was terrible. I love orange chicken but it was dry and stringy. Cold spring rolls, the refried rice was okay but no flavor. What buffet offers no beef. Carving station had pork, chicken, and ham. It all looked bad enough that I passed. This buffet has been cut to the barebones. Even the salad bar was quite minimal with less costly items. The desserts as I remembered use to be very good. My sis brought over pastries, pie and a few cookies. We were disappointed. Actually I'm going to call it terrible. It's getting two stars because my niece thought it was cool that she could have cheesecake and ice cream. She also liked her spaghetti but she's eight.  I had points so I only paid for one of us. I would never ever pay for this buffet again. Actually I would not go for free. Hopefully management will change it up with fresher options.",

I had planned our itinerary so that we could visit the Henderson casinos on our first day prior to our check in at our strip casino.   Green Valley was really nice and the last stop on our tour of the Henderson casinos.  After playing slots for awhile we decided to have lunch at the Feast Buffet.  There was quite a line but it moved quickly. The buffet is very large and offers many options of food including Italian, Asian, and others.   I started with the Market Selection which is the salad bar. The food was very good but I felt it could have offered more in the way of toppings.   For main dishes I tried the carved roast turkey and the BBQ Chicken.   The turkey was fabulous and possibly the best I've had anywhere.   The chicken was cooked well but not overdone and the BBQ sauce was tangy and sweet.   Side dishes were all good.  For desert I had the Oreo Parfait. It has an awkward texture but taste good.  The Coconut Cream pie while looking somewhat plain was Extremely good every part of it was fabulously delicious.   I can't remember the waitresses names but our waitress got hung up in another section but another server took on our table with no complaints.  I wish I could remember her name because she was very very good.   Service oriented and very friendly.   We ate here and the the Feast at Red Rock but I will say the GVR Feast was the better of the two during our trip.",

    "text": "If you're from the Bay Area and are a compulsive gambler, I mean, buffet lover like me, this buffet is similar to The Feast Buffet at Thunder Valley Casino.  It has the same name, same look and feel and when TVC first opened, it was a Stations Casino just like Green Valley Ranch is.    We had dinner here on Easter Sunday so pretty much, they raised the price to $25.99 for adults and the only difference is that there were a tray of Peeps in the dessert station.  Apparently if you're a Stations Casinos player card holder, you'll get a discount.  Every little bit helps.  But focusing on food quality and selection, let's face it, no one can top the buffets of the big box luxury casinos, i.e. Bellagio and Wynn.  But at the same time, you're paying almost double, if not more.  With that said, the offering at The Feast were decent, probably a little too basic meaning, they served the typical Fried Chicken, Mashed Potatoes, Pasta, Pizza, etc.  They had your usual Asian, Italian, Mexican, American and Seafood stations.  The Salad Bar was nice as they had a few mixed salads, antipasto and chilled shrimp.  I'm really surprised that they didn't have any crab, especially with the premium in pricing.  Overall, The Feast was a nice buffet but certainly not the best out there in Vegas.  As far as in Henderson well, Studio B has The Feast beat.",

While some buffets gave decent side dish options, Green Valley does not.  This buffet has lowered its price for January and gotten rid of its crab legs (wooo!). It seems as though they are strained with M being so close and that buffet being better. Even if I wasn't vegan, I still would not want to eat here, not much looked very appetizing and the service was a bit sub par.  I was here a few years ago and it was better then, there were a few tofu dishes. At the mongolian gril station a few years ago the cook got tofu from the back and made something with separate utensils. No luck this time. There are only meat options at the grill and they won't use separate utensils for meat and veggie. I mean, seriously, how hard is it to have a little tofu kicking about and 2 pairs of tongs? Really?  The Bok Choy in the asian section was super overcooked and gross. The salad bar was a bit disappointing too. Really the only thing to eat as a vegan was veggie chow mein which had very few veggies. Pretty disappointing if you ask me. I will be very happy if I don't have to eat here again.",

I piled on about 5-6 sections and tried to chow down. They must have a gotten a great deal on these crab legs because I was barely able to get anything out of them. When I did get some crab meat it was falling apart and stringy. It's a shame these crabs gave their lives to have most of their meat thrown away. I moved onto the muscles and clams, thinking they had to be better. Now, I know all of these things come from the sea, but they were the fishiest tasting specimens I've ever had. Again, a waste of a living organism. Finally, I gave the fruit a shot. That was the only thing I ate all of. My advice is to go to the oyster bar and pay $32 for the 1.5 pounds of crab legs where you can actually get some quality meat out of them.",

Ive experienced better\" or now an A-OK in my book.  I opted to go with the A-OK because me and you go way back.  For those that know me I am a simple girl with simple taste buds and I do not seek out those razzle dazzle fancy pants buffets that most enjoy.  That is why I thought we had a good thing going here Feast Buffet.  I mean you are always sending me coupons telling me you like me and want me to come back for a visit.  That is why I can not understand for the life of me why you have replaced your mac and cheese (my favorite item) on your menu with \"chili mac and cheese\".  The first time this impostor mac and cheese and I came into contact it took my breath away, and not in a good way.  I immediately became panicked and it through off my entire routine.  After I calmed down and collected my thoughts I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt and think maybe you had some ingredients you needed to use up so you decided to through the kitchen sink into the simplest staple item on any decent buffet.   Fast forward to our next encounter.  The chili mac and cheese is still there and now it looks like it has a permanent home.  I don't know what to do.  At this point I have told my husband you and I are through until you get your act together.  No one likes chili mac and cheese.. what is this a family reunion?  Take a look at the pot, there is usually one poor soul who has taken a scoop of this nonsense because they are either color blind and doesn't notice the mac and cheese now has a horrible burnt sienna hue to it or maybe just feels bad that no one else is eating it.   This is a test of our friendship Feast Buffet.  The ball is in your court.",

The prime rib is the best buffet prime rib I've ever had. It rivals that of some finer Prime Rib establishments. The crab legs are hit and miss. Sometimes they are really good and sometimes I don't go back for seconds. I love the bread pudding here, it's some of the best I've had anywhere. Overall it's a good one and it's 24.99 on Fri night w/player's card and 17.99 on Sat. night.",

    "text": "I've made the cardinal mistake of coming here on Father's Day. Yes yes, lack of insight. I've paid dearly for it.  I checked the prices a few days before. No mention of Father's Day or Holiday pricing. Sunday brunch is costly enough. Father's Day brunch cost $25 (w/o players card). The line was crazy long and I didn't know about this steep price until I had to pay. Would have been good to have some time to get a player's card.  But this is father's day! Bring out those father's day special buffet options!  ...  I would say it was exactly the same as the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station (where it's close to $10 most days), but Sunset Station was better. First, it looked like the dining room was tinier than Sunset Station. This with the combination of being a busy buffet day could explain the wait. The options were the same Feast options you always see.  I had some of the Chinese options, which were not good. Broccoli and beef was just slimy goop. Orange chicken was dry. Tried some American breakfast. The bacon is the kind of Oscar Meyer microwaveable bacon you see discounted at the 99 cent store.   I just settled on Prime Rib. That's the go to food for me at a buffet. One lunatic wanted their prime rib well done. The prime rib I got was a medium rare slice of goodness. Was it worth the 45 minutes in line and $25 a person (and I paid for five people)? Nope.   There's no shortage of buffets in Las Vegas. This one would be an adequate buffet on a Wednesday morning, but avoid this buffet at prime times.",

    "text": "Sat lunch buffet review  For being one of the nicer, if not the nicest Station Casino, I was shocked to see just how small this buffet is. Now there are plenty of things to eat, and of what I ate, most everything was very good, but it is noticeably smaller than the Red Rock buffet, which I think is the best out of the Station Casinos.  When I go to buffets, I have a rule for myself. Well not so much a rule... more like a guideline. I eat only fish and veggies, no meat (besides a bowl of menudo, my favorite) or carbs. Even with this er, guideline, I was able to find lots of eat, but this is not Vegas' largest buffet by far.  They do have a Mongolian bbq station, which you won't find everywhere. However their salad bar and dessert section is smaller than average.  I did like how they have pesto sauce by itself in the pasta station. I love pesto so I put some on my grilled zucchini. Also they have a huge bowl of anitpasti there too; several kinds of olives, onion, pepperoncini, artichoke hearts, etc.  At the salad bar I like how they have pre-dressed salad options, my favorite being the spring mix with dried cranberries, walnuts and feta. On the other side of the salad bar was a very good and very rich hummus and israeli couscous. Yum.  Some of the misses: Bf said the turkey was dry. There was another meat at the carving station and he asked the carver guy what it was. He mumbles something then just cut him a piece. This was also dry. The pizza didn't look good. They only had cheese or pepperoni out, and looked like no sauce and a thick crust, which is the opposite of what I prefer, so luckily for my waistline, I skipped this.  Overall it was perfectly ok. But I do prefer Red Rock, more choices, larger dining room, and closer to my house.",

The staff is super nice and helpful with any and all questions or concerns you might have.  The selection is great as well. They have a Mongolian BBQ section right next to the international grill, where the chefs will also be happy to make you a fresh burger with anything you please on it.  My favorite part about the buffet is that food is constantly being prepared and out out to ensure that your favorite dishes are always available and fresh. I always recommend this buffet to others!",

    "text": "This is the best buffet in Las Vegas in terms of quality, variety and value. I eat here at least once a week. You can go all the time and never have the same meal twice. This buffet is a bargain at dinner time. For around $14 you can eat all you want and it includes a soda, coffee, tea, etc.   This buffet isn't the fanciest in town but it excels at serving good quality, crowd pleasing dishes. There's a great salad bar that features several pre-made salads (think Asian salad, coleslaw, spinach and blue cheese salad, chicken salad, marinated artichoke hearts) and a fix-it-yourself traditional salad bar. Cocktail shrimp are also in this section as well as fruit and cottage cheese.  The Asian station is top notch with a variety of veggie, beef and fish dishes and good soups / rice / stir fry. The Mongolian grill is my favorite feature of this buffet! You load up your bowl with fresh vegetables (they have a great selection that includes spinach, mushrooms, onions, noodles, peppers, zucchini and lots more) then tell the chef the type of meat you want (chicken, shrimp, pork beef, Korean ribs) and choose from a list of sauces and they cook it up for you. It's always good and always fresh. They will also cook up a cheesesteak for you here too if you ask, or if you just want a plate of Korean ribs they'll oblige.  Next comes the Mexican station with MADE TO ORDER FAJITAS, several good Mexican dishes and a taco bar. The American station is fine with carved roast beef (usually prepared very well done), salmon at dinner and delicious roasted turkey. You'll usually find fried shrimp, fried chicken, baked fish and more. They have a good selection of vegetables here too, including green beans, broccoli, mashed potatoes, corn, cabbage, collard greens and other favorites like macaroni and cheese.  The Italian station is good too with sausage and peppers, a variety of pasta bakes, spaghetti, garlic veggies, and antipasti platter and YUMMY fresh-baked pizzas. I love the pizza here, it's so good but it's also popular so you may have to stand around and the pizza oven and wait for a fresh pie to come out on the line. You'd better move fast because the pizza disappears as fast as it's served.  The absolute highlight of this buffet is their dessert section. They have an INSANE selection of sugar free desserts. I am in dessert heaven at this place. Choose from sugar free brownies, cream pies, apple pie, cherry pie, chocolate fudge cake, lemon cake carrot cake, cheesecake....and this is just the sugar free section! They also have NO SUGAR ADDED frozen yogurt in their soft serve machine, another feature I go bonkers for! There's a scoopable ice cream case as well where you can get hand-spun milkshakes (sorry, no sugar free options in that case). I never eat the full sugar desserts but there are plenty of cookies, pastries and other goodies.  The lines here can get out of control so be prepared to wait. If you go at less popular times, you can usually get seated in less than 10 minutes. Go during peak hours and you'll be waiting anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. The only other negative comment I have about this buffet is the service. Sometimes it can be horrible, other times it's good. Try not to sit too far in the back, that's where you usually get stuck in the bad waiter zone.",

The won ton soup is phenomenal, the sea bass is yummy (when it's a fresh plate), the rigatoni is usually nice too and their deserts are on par with most local buffets. It seems like the dishes don't really change much, they seem to cater to the \"Sun City\" crowd and go with the usual safe choices. Don't expect anything fancy or special, just the usual stuff. Service is so-so, minimal interactions with the waiters, but that's how I like it anyways.",

Everything is presented nicely, got 1 small pancake, 1 small waffel, 2 sausage links, and the worst looking runny and not even cooked scrambled eggs. I stirred them up and took some from around the outer banks. We ordered coffee and small milk brought to the table. Told our waiter we had a complaint, he went and got the floor manager, Jack. Showed him the uncooked eggs, and how cold items were. No sorry, but he said he would check. Never returned, we took another plate and went back to get other items, so disturbed, saw Mgr. Jack, said oh ya just need to stir the eggs, I said how unappealing to see cups of liquid through out eggs..... especially eww. We went got a bagel toasted, fresh fruit and called it a horrible experience for the 3rd time. We live here and it is unacceptable. Plus Jack did not offer a comp for the $17.98 we paid nor the tip we always leave. Shame on you GVR....clean up your act!!!!",

    "text": "Not very impressed with this buffet. We went on a Wednesday during lunch time. The wait to be seated was actually quite long. This is not our first experience with a station buffet... but our first at Green Valley. Honestly the Sunset Station, which is near by, was a far better buffet for many reasons. Reason one... the Sunset is a little cheaper than Green Valley. Green Valley's food isn't any better than Sunset. Actually enjoyed Sunset better and it was cheaper. Reason two... our waitress at Green Valley was not very helpful and seemed more irritated when we asked questions about our drink order. At Sunset the staff was very friendly and helpful. Reason three... they didn't seem to care for big party's of six with kids. They seemed to grouped all the party's with kids in the far back corner of the restaurant. Sunset station is very kid friendly. Don't want to sound terrible but they seemed to cater more for older adults... which brings me to... Reason number four... the other restaurant goers (mostly older adults) seemed rude and put off that there were kids in the restaurant. Sunset seemed to be more family oriented and very kid friendly. All in all... I probably won't revisit Green Valley. Next time I will head over to Sunset.",

Feast had at least three different kinds of fish for anyone who doesn't eat meat and ton of stations full of delicious options.

Third, the food is a bit better: they have an omelet bar, a mimosa bar and will cook your crab legs and shrimp in an awesome Bay spice mixture. The service is excellent. But that wait!

Last night Friday we waited in line for an hour. When we buy the buffet it came out to $28 per person. And that was the child's price also. I asked why and they said it was Seafood night. Ok well we already stayed in line might as well just eat. As long as it's seafood night I'm sure they will have plenty of ... oh I don't know.... SEAFOOD???? SILLY ME FOR THINKING THAT. Once kids were settled I looked for my food. I asked where the grilled/poached/baked fish was... guess what? Nope... they didn't have any fish. Any type of food was deep fried something. You gotta be kidding me.... seafood buffet but no fish. The only reason why I think the call it seafood is because they have tiny cra b legs and shrimp.  Of course my kids were happy but my wife and I simply ate a salad and a piece of chicken. No Fish on seafood night... oh vay.... we went to movies afterwards and bought a hot dog there.",

    "text": "Last night, my mom decided to take us to the Green Valley Feast Around the World Buffet. She said it's good so we decided to give it a go. Since it was a Saturday night it cost $21.99 per adult. The difference being that it had \"Surf & Turf.\"   As with all Vegas style buffets there are different stations dedicated to different ethnic categories of food. There was a Chinese station, a Mongolian station, a Mexican station, an Italian station, a carving station, a salad bar, and a dessert bar. Perhaps there were other stations that I can't really remember at this moment.   I thought the food was alright. It definitely wasn't spectacular, but then again no buffet is. I'm not a buffet snob, but being that my dad used to own several restaurants (most of them being buffets) and me even working at two of them I believe I have the background and experience to say what's good and what's not.   They had crab legs but there was a pretty big crowd around it so I didn't even bother. Why wait in line to get some skimpy legs when I didn't even bother eating it at my dad's restaurants, ever? I can even eat King crab legs at home several times throughout the year. The carne deshebrada was way too salty. Salty to the point where I had to toss it out. The oysters were just whatever. Most of them were small and lacked the creaminess that I desired. Believe me, I love oysters but these weren't that great. The prime rib wasn't bad and neither was the cheese pizza. I was hoping that they would have creme brulee since that's the only dessert I like. However, they didn't. They had a pretty good selection of other stuff including bread pudding, cookies, cupcakes (miniature ones), pies, etc. Nothing I desired in the least but my sister got a plate of assorted desserts and I ended up eating the bread pudding. It was rather good.   I decided to get a plate of Mongolian noodles. I loaded it with mushrooms, pineapples, spinach, ginger, and chili sauce. They had beef, chicken, pork, and seafood to choose from. I would have preferred lamb but since they didn't offer it I chose beef. The cook gave me so much meat that half of the plate consisted of beef and the other half noodles. It was even too much meat for me and I'm a meat person.   Overall the experience was alright. The one thing that really sucked is that they don't have Coke products but instead have gross Pepsi products. I went with an unsweetened iced tea instead.",

    "text": "UPDATE: This place now charges $5 a lb. for the seafood, so no more all you can eat crabs! That really stinks, huh? So the buffet is set for about $16 for dinner, and you are given poker chips to pay for the seafood....POOOOOO!  My friends, family and boyfriend love this place! Crab legs for dinner, but not just any crabs! They can be cooked with a mix of butter, garlic, jalapeno peppers, and a bunch of other great seasonings and spices to add a unique flavor to those fresh crab legs. The fresh crab legs need to be opened with those crackers, but if you eat crab a lot, I'm pretty sure you know how to properly break those crab legs! This buffet actually marks the crab legs where you should break it, so that it makes it easier for you to eat with your hands! You can also get your shrimp sauteed with those ingredients too. The shrimp is usually fresh there, but I have seen some nights where they put the shrimp in the salad bar section (which sometimes looks as if the shrimp has been there for a whie). They have many types of food here, including Asian, Mexican, and Italian. I personally like their pizza here and their various types of pasta. If you're in the Asian section, you have to try their barbeque pork too! It is very tasty! My boyfriend loves the prime rib here. You can be the judge. It is rather tasty, juicy, and tender. Thinking of it makes me hungry.  This buffet also features a Mongolian type grill section, which is sort of nice when you want something made to your taste. I had just recently discovered from my friend, Theresa, that they also can cook Korean ribs there (only at brunch and dinner time of course!).   Also, don't miss out on the dessert section. They have a wide selection of Dreyer's ice cream like cookie dough, strawberry, cookies and cream, chocolate, vanilla, etc. You can even make milkshakes too!  Come to this buffet if you're in the Henderson area, especially after checking out this nice resort (You have to look at the pool area! Don't forget that the show Hell's Kitchen was filmed here for a couple of episodes, and the winner of this last year operates the Italian restaurant Terra Verde here too!).   For reference, here are the Buffet Prices and Hours:   Breakfast: Monday - Friday: 8am - 11:30am $7.99 per person or $6 .99 with BP Card   Brunch: Saturday & Sunday: 8am - 3:30pm $18 .99 per person or $16.99 with BP Card   Lunch: Monday - Friday: 11:30am - 3pm $10.99 per person or $9.99 with BP Card   Dinner: Monday - Sunday: 3:30pm - 10pm $18.99 per person or $16.99 with BP Card  BP card is the Boarding Pass card for the Station Casinos",

My grandfather has suffered from a medical condition resulting in hand tremors for years and apparently this waitress mistook the tremors for drunkeness. As such, she deemed it necessary to supply judgement in the form of comments such as \"Just suck on your ice cubes, you're drunk anyway\" and \"here you go, drunk puppy.\" My grandfather had less than a single glass of wine. The comments were hurtful and rude. A manager was alerted to the problem, but I would recommend finding an equally good buffet elsewhere.  We won't be back.",

There were still a good amount of people here even though it was a Sunday night.  Let me start off with a huge minus...there weren't any sushi!!! I mean..how can they call their restaurant FEAST AROUND THE WORLD, and have no sushi??? I found that pretty odd, because even the lil cheap buffets you see everywhere have sushi!   Anyways, they had a lot of the traditional American foods such as mac and cheese, fried chicken, pizza, many different pasta dishes, they had prime rib, and then they had the mexican station where you can create your own tacos/nachos. They also had an Asian section with the typical fried rice/chow mein. They had your other typical Asian dishes such as orange chicken, wontons, hot and sour sweet, etc.   One thing I liked about this restaurant though is..they had the FRESHESTcrab legs ever!! I mean..and they had three different styles! They had the Asian style..which was cooked with ginger and green onions..very tasty. My only complaint would be that it was not temperatute hot enough. They also had the chilled crab legs that you could dip in butter. And then they had a section where you pick as many crab legs as you want, and then you put all these ingredients such as garlic, peppers, soy sauce, onions, etc into a bowl and they stir fry it in front of you! It comes out piping hot, and basically comes out to your liking, because you're giving the cook what you want him to cook your crabs with.   Their dessert selection was also plentiful. They had a bakery like display, and you just picked what you wanted. They also had a smoothie bar! I have never seen that at any buffet!   At the end of the day, I wouldn't mind coming back here agian just the for the crab legs. I still can't believe they didn't have sushi!",

It reminded me of a fancier Hometown Buffet. The food wasn't gourmet like buffets in Vegas, but it was fancier than other \"normal\" buffets with normal buffet food. They had prime rib station which is always a plus. They also had a taco making station. Also, you could make your own pasta. The salad was delish too. My sweet tooth was satisfied because they had a little dessert buffet. We were there at closing so most of the good dessert was gone, but they still had some of their good bread pudding and of course ice cream! I got vanilla and ordered a root beer and made a root beer float. =D This ended the night for me. I was stuffed! Definitely got my $15 worth!

The chef carving the prime rib acted like he bought that shit himself.

Well maybe the fucker had bad eyes but that shit was still you're standard half inch cut. Ass.

The leafy greens looked brown. There wasn't a huge selection. I expected so much more in both quality and selection.   I pretty much had a small serving of everything vegetarian. Most of what I tried was disappointing. The bok choy was over cooked and slimy. The spanish rice was bland and dry. The egg rolls were definitely frozen. The pizzas didn't even look appetizing. The egg drop soup lacked flavor. I could continue on and on...  Let's skip to the few things I did enjoy. The tofu stir fry was actually really good. Full of flavor, the tofu had good texture. The bread pudding for dessert was actually really good as well. I topped the bread pudding with the vanilla sauce and it was awesome.   Service was good once we were seated. Our drink order was taken promptly and we never ran out. I even got coffee to enjoy with my dessert.   I left with that \"meh\" feeling.   I can definitely say that I wouldn't return.

I would give the food about a 3.  The service however is terrible.  It was impossible to get more water, champagne, or our plates taken away by our server, Jose. At first we thought his section was too busy, but then when a couple of large parties cleared out and he had just 2 tables, still no service. The couple behind us just started to yell, \"Hey BUDDY!\" across the room to get his attention when they needed something.   The thing is, he saw our tables (the old side look), but refused to come over. When we finally got him to come over and asked him for more champagne, he told me I was cut off and ran away without taking the mountain of plates or bringing more water. Last straw.   I'm a bigger guy at around 6'2 220lbs and fit, and I certainly had not even begun to approach being drunk, nor had anyone at my table. (I was there with my mother and my wife, not some bachelor's party).  I got up, went to the front and asked for the manager. Mandy came out and I explained that the service was terrible, that this was a buffet, and asked if there was some sort of limit on drinks that I was not aware of. She told me no, only that the service staff is instructed to cut people off if they are obviously drunk. I asked her if I appeared in any way drunk or otherwise inappropriate or disorderly. She confirmed, that no, in no way was I. I then asked her, ok, please handle the situation, because it was ridiculous to be treated that way by a server.  So, I thought she would, but then she didn't do anything. Jose simply never came back to our table, not for water, not for anything. I would say they both were racist, but the table behind us (the \"hey buddy\" table) were a different color altogether and received the same bs. At least they suck equally for everyone.  Sometimes servers have bad days and I get that, but it is totally unacceptable for a manager not to resolve issues.",

This is a place that you would want to walk around and take pictures. The parking is free and extremely convenient.  The ambiance in True buffet is stunning. From the decor to the set up, everything looks clean and attractive.  They have a great build your own stir fry station and a candy mix in station for ice cream.  This is something very different.  The sushi was fresh, the food was similar to other feast buffets but we did enjoy the variety!",

They are decadent. The staff are all friendly and efficient, at least when we go there, their performances are on point.  It's a place that I recommend to locals and visitors.

    "text": "Not the same. This used to be one of my favorite buffets, for their seafood buffet on Fridays used to be the best. However, this buffet has changed negatively. First off, I got in line at 7PM, and I was not seated until 8:30PM. On top of that, the buffet closes at 9 and the servers constantly rushed me to get food before they stopped serving food. My server was very rude.  I always came for the crab, where they would cook it for you with garlic, spices, and sauces. However, the cooks were very disorganized. They started cooking everyone's crab together instead of individually because there were so many people in line, and many people left the station with less crab than they put up to cook. There was a lady in front of me who complained about how she received less cooked crab than she gave to cook. It turns out that I received some of the crab she had, for the cook gave me a huge portion of crab. The biggest complaint is that they do not crack the crab for you anymore. They used to use their metal spatulas and break open the crab for you, but now you have to do all of the work.  The crab is delicious, and that is the only positive. Don't even bother with the rest of the food here. For the amount of money and time you spend, it's simply not worth it.",

Breakfast, lunch or dinner it's possibly my favorite buffet in Vegas, 2nd to South Point. Choices are wide and great here, options ranging from Chinese, Italian, Latin, American, desserts and huge salad bar.  You'll definitely gain 5lbs here and it'll all be worth it. Worth the visit  Service has varied based on time. Ive experienced 5 min sit times and I've also been completely ignored. It does get busy but there is plenty seating.

We could see empty tables as we waited that were never seated! Then as we are paying the manager informs us that we only have 45 minutes to eat before they take away all the food! We were livid as were the other people in line with us.  The manager told us, \"well you are more than welcome to leave & not eat here.\"  We wanted to know why we were not told of the food being taken away at precisely 9:45pm while we waited 2 hours in line!  Instead we were not informed until we were paying! The Manager's response was, \"would you like to talk to the head chef?\"  So we said yes.  So Chef Frank came out & when we thought it couldn't get worse he was even ruder than the Manager! His first comment to us was, \"You wanted to talk to me?\"  I said no, the Manager offered for us to talk to you though so we are wanting a solution or at least better communication for future patrons.  He flat out LIED to us saying there are empty tables that are not seated for reservations (they only take reservations for large parties, these were 4 top tables!)  We were told it was our faults & we should have arrived earlier than 7pm if we wanted to eat at the buffet.  I honestly was speechless & starving after this & eating elsewhere was not an option since we also had our kids with us & we were all starving! So we paid $30/person for us to quickly shove a few crab legs down our throats.  Its a shame because we thought the crab was delicious.  The only good part of this night was our waiter who was excellent.  I wish I had gotten his name.    Bottom line: Will NEVER come back here again, not even for regular buffet due to the rude Management they have working here & lack of communication.  You would think that Station Casinos would excel in customer service, but apparently that is not the case with the Feast Buffet.",

    "text": "Came here for a meal with my grandmother today (Friday, Feb 3rd, 2017). Had heard from a friend, this specific \"Feast Buffet\" at the Green Valley Ranch, had seafood buffet on friday's and they take their hot crabs and cook it to your liking (adding garlic, onions, chili, tomatoes.)  We had arrived around 0230PM and got to the cashier. Right before paying, the cashier had told me the buffet closes at 0345PM, if i wanted to stay for dinner, i pay for the difference between the lunch and dinner prices. I had talked to my grandmother and shes like eh since we were here, might as well eat, just $10 per person for lunch, with boarding pass (station casino's players card). I've never heard of a buffet have their customers pay additionally so i decided to test it, wondering if it was just a gimmick the cashier used  For lunch, there isnt much of a selection. Their buffet isnt big to begin with in comparison to other buffets around town. Dessert area, italian, american, mexican, and Mongolian/Chinese. Oh also a salad bar. Decided to kill some time, get a plate or two of the mongolian (i like baby corn, water chestnuts, and mushrooms... and oh garlic... so guess what mine consisted of... xD)  italian had 3 different pieces with calzones and breadsticks.. some pastas and raviolis that look dried out from being untouched, normal alfredo and tomato sauces and meatballs  american had ham and turkey at the carving station as well as the usual catfish, potatoes, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, mac n cheese, brussel sprouts, meatloaf, etc.   mexican had tamales and like a taco bar...  mongolian is the usual mongolian hot plate thing where you get your own ingredients and they cook for you with your choice of meat and sauce (oh they are very heavy handed on the sauce... let them know if you want it lighter!)  chinese had the usual uhh fried rice, chow mein, veggie egg roll, fried wonton skins, chinese bbq pork (not fatty), eggplant  For a buffet, kind of a low selection, considering im almost able to name em all in such a short review.... off the top of my head hours after being there...   Essentially ate at a slow pace while chatting. 0345p hit, no one came around aside from one person saying last call for lunch and thats it.... a few tables left around me and a huge party int he area next to us. By 0400pm, a decent amount of people were rolling in. The people around us that were here as long if not longer than us got up and got crab. So we did too. They have cold and hot crab, also the option to hand the hot crab to chef's next to the station to cook with additional flavor/seasoning. Seemed like a lot of people knew about this style and the line formed fairly quickly for it. I had asked for everything and spicy. Not bad. Pretty messy. As mentioned before, they used garlic, onions, tomatoes, chili sauce and cooked over a hot plate.   By the time i almost finished my plate, a new waiter had started working the area, checked out receipt on the table, and i guess called the manager or someone over. That person explained that they had someone come around saying last call.. I assumed it was last call to get food before they closed to prepare for dinner. Usually any other buffet, thats what it meant during their \"down time/last call/etc\". They explained either we can leave or pay the difference. Never had i ever experienced anything like this. I'm almost tempted to call it a racist thing as we were the only asian table in the area. They didnt have any other table leave except ours, and they've been here longer, as my grandmother had noticed. We just decided to get up and leave and didnt want to argue. we were kind of prepared to leave anyway but it just seemed really weird for this to happen.",

The food is plentiful.  From fruits to cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, and more!  The staff is usually great here  Decided to check out Sunday brunch.  It was $16.99 with a players card.  We waited in line for a long while.  I was looking forward to this!    Yay!!! We paid and will be next to be seated.  Everything is usual.  We order our drinks and off we go!  What's for brunch!? Nothing fancy the usual as if you were to come on the week day.  I don't understand the double price.  Pretty disappointed.    Our server JOSE!  I don't know if he was overwhelmed or he jus didn't like us.  I asked for a refill twice and the third time he came back he saw me and was had that look like oops!  And he said you wanted something?  I forgot!  I was like yes my lemonade please, I said it with a smile.  Towards the end of our meal I asked for a few more napkins,  2 napkins between the both of us at a buffet,  we couldn't do it lol.  He's gone for awhile and he comes back and sees me and has that look again!  He steals some napkins on the table across from us,  which the people were jus seated and went to get some food.  I couldn't help my self,  I start laughing!  LMFAO.  By this time,  I'm in satisfied with my meal, just irritated that I skipped the ice cream.    Never again!  I will stick to the breakfast buffet.",

    "text": "**Be aware** This buffet is no longer on the second floor. Best entrance for it is located near the valet closer to Rancho Drive.  Once inside, it is right next to the Boathouse restaurant.  This review is for the breakfast buffet on a weekday. One star for the beautiful and spacious redecorated interior One star for the friendly and attentive server (could barely understand him, but he was a cute little old man) One star for their vegan options We are not buffet eaters as they all seem to be the same. The hubster and I celebrated with a day off from work to send our kids back to school. I was craving pancakes or waffles and a salad. We decided on a cheap buffet. We opted not to sign up for the boarding pass card so we paid 10.99 each, otherwise it would be 8.99 each with the card. I would say 10.99 is a fair price for this breakfast buffet. There was not alot of people in line at 930am, but after we paid, they were slow to corral us to our table, around 10 minutes. So my cravings fantasies were crushed as they had belgian waffles, but I could taste the egg in them,  so I passed them on to the hubster who soaked them in maple syrup and devoured them. They only had gluten free pancakes which I passed on and not a bowl of mixed green salad could be found however, they had a kale apple salad with plantains in it and it was absolutely delicious!  I made my way to the Healthy Favorites station where they had about 4 vegan dishes. They had a vegan shakshuka made with Tofu, which I absolutely loved. In fact all of their vegan dishes were very tasty. There was a rice dish with cranberries and corn mixed in it and a chickpea, spinach and sweet potato dish that complimented it. The gluten free pancakes was part of this station. They had taro and mocha smoothie shots, the taro was fresh taro, and did not taste good. The mocha was tasty. Most of their desserts had a weird texture. Like the chocolate cake that literally felt like a dry sponge, we pretty much poked at it with our fingers and passed on it. The slice of carrot cake loaf did not taste right, so that got passed on too. I hate wasting food. The best tasting desserts were: Blueberry muffin  (great texture, fluffy and full of blueberries) Sugar free apple turnover Chocolate croissant (buttery and flaky but only a smidgen of choco inside) All in all I feel like we got our 10.99 worth plus more.",

    "text": "REPOST:For the past 3 years, I have dined regularly at the GVR Feast buffet.  In regards to Friday seafood night, the price has increased over $12.  With a significant price increase, the food taste quality has not followed.   For all the crab leg fanatics, that fell in love with their sauteed version, those days are gone.  I went there in Oct, Nov, and Dec of 2018 and it was great!   To give you a brief history, original (elder) woman, that probably helped start the recipe, is no longer around.   The cooks that took her place took a while to get it right, but they finally did.     Now, they have started a new tactic where they have the crab sauteed for you on the line.   You can't ask for spicy and you can't add shrimp into it.  Maybe this is an attempt to cut costs with portion control or to alleviate the long lines, I don't know.  So what's my assessment?  My crab was cold and it didn't have much flavor.  In short, I was completely disappointed.  There was no point in complaining because for this to happen, I feel that they have lost a lot of pride in taste quality.",

Price is about 60% less than Buffet prices on the strip at Rio, Ceasars, Mandalay Bay, Wicked Spoon, etc.  I definitely am not into AYCE, but had loyalty points on my Rewards card, and the gang wanted to go.  I went Monday night, and there was a 30 min line...another reason I do not like buffets, but it was extremely busy in there.  There was a large assortment of food, asian, Mexican, American.  I did like their salad bar, and everything I got, was pretty good. I was impressed.  I got wonton soup, a bbq pork rib, mash potatoes, meatballs, fried shrimp, Cesar Salad and Korean ribs.  Alot if food not on the menu, must be a secret menu ad I found out from locals we were sitting with.  For example, the Mongolian station, also made Philly Cheesesteak Sandwiches.  I would eat here again.",

If you join their players card, you get $5 off your buffet price. So I believe it was $18.99 for dinner?? I THINK.  To me, I'm a simple kind of girl when it comes to food. Just give me the basic stuff like pizza, pasta, dumplings, hot soup, salad bar, potatoes, chicken, rice...you know...simple basic everyday food. Don't give me none of that fancy-smancy crab legs, oysters, sushi....basically the seafood crap that AUTOMATICALLY makes the price skyrocket.  With this buffet, it satisfy my needs.  Best part of the buffet is the dessert bar. For such a simple buffet they have a variety of cakes to choose from. They also got a ice cream station with many flavors to chose from. Now, for me, a dessert bar is not considered a GOOD dessert bar if they don't have my MINT N CHIPS OR PISTACHIO gelato and/or ice cream. But thank goodness they have mint n chips!!! =) Yay!!!!! I'm a happy girl. You can turn your ice cream into a milkshake too!!! + on that one.   To break it down:  M Resort \"Studio B Buffet\" : 5 stars TI/Rio's Carnival World Buffet: 4 stars Green Valley Ranch Buffet: 3 stars Aria Buffet: 2 stars ...and thank goodness I didn't have to experience a 1 star buffet in Vegas yet.  You know I've been to Vegas too often when I start to venture off the strip.",

    "text": "When it comes to buffets I like to call myself experienced!! I love them! They are always full of an awesome variety of food and you can never go wrong with the fresh made stir fry.... Unless you eat here  What a terrible I mean terrible Dinner Starting off with the worst customer service ever. Vegas is known for there buffets and great food and service at restaurants and other things but we are are talking food here!   I kid you not after about a 15 min wait in line which is typical for buffets around dinner time so I'm not complaining about that but what started the hatred was the simple fact that it took 45 min to get our drinks. Yeah ok we had a table of 9 including kids but seriously 45 min to get water and a soda. We all were on our second go around of plates and ready to make the third trip down when we finally got our order of drinks that was placed when we first got there. Then to top it off as normal we finished our drinks fast yeah we were thirsty the lady took roughly 15-20 min To come back to our table with our refills. At this point I asked if she could just bring us a pitcher of water. Which to our surprise was pretty fast. (Now after you read my rant go through there pictures and witness first hand the nasty filthy pitcher she put on our table.) as we examine the filth inside and out and with the disappearance of our server again we decide to go to the front and ask to speak with a manager. Lady says what table are you ok I will send the manager there. 10 min 20 min 30 min 45 min go bye and finally after the waitress who just sees all of us sitting there asks If there is anything you need. At this point we say yes the manager that we have been waiting for! Now side note I'm not one to complain and moan but when it's bad it's bad. Finally after over 45 min the manager comes to our table we explain to her our issues with the wait for her, the drinks, the terrible service the terrible dried out food....which I've yet to rant about... The dirty nasty pitcher were just a few things that we laid into her. Much to our surprise She begins to defend her staff and say well thats not what she said, and on and on... lady look at the pitcher and examine the situation before you speak... then she goes on saying well you asked for a pitcher.. Damn straight we asked for a pitcher of water. Well I'm sorry sir but we don't give pitchers here. Ok wtf you did and look at it. Yes sir it appears to be dirty but again we do not give out pitchers and sir the water is clear... Wait what did she say. The water is clear so what my dogs bowl water is clear and you don't see me drinking Out of there bowl! Anyway she results to saying after she finally examines the situation and sees that it's been bad she lays into the server and basically tells her off she says well I can give you 2 comps and you can eat here again for free....um let me think about that. The service was terrible, the dish wear was filthy I mean so bad I wouldn't let my dog use it, the food was less than mediocre... hmm yeah I would love to come back said no one ever!!",

I visited the green valley buffet this Christmas Eve with my wife. Arrived about 7 pm for dinner. The line was not long at all. If you go on the strip, you are waiting for an hour. The Christmas Eve dinner price was about $20 per person that night. We actually paid $10 per because we got a 2-4-1 coupon in the mail for being a club member. Which I suggest guest get for the discounted prices and deals onfood and play at any stations casinos.    After paying we were seated right away. The table was not on level ground but I fixed that with the extra napkins I got. They served our drinks before we got back from the bar and was on there best service refilling drinks and clearing our plates. Its the reason We come back over and over again. I can say so much about the food good and bad but that would be a long list. The price you pay for the quality of food you get surpasses any bad.The soft serve ice cream is my favorite with all feast buffets because it's not yogurt. Mmm and they let me walk out with a cone for on the go. Thank you for the experiences.",

It certainly is not anywhere near gourmet, but for a family dining experience, this is tough to beat for about $14 for dinner. And the deserts must be shared among the Station Casinos. They have the same splendid Spumoni ice cream as the Red Rock Casino, and the food was virtually identical. And in this particular case, that is a very good thing!  We were very pleased with the entire experience at this Casino, and this simply added to the appeal. We will return on our next vacation in a few months!",

We were there at 7pm, not right before closing, and all the food was old. The prime was rare, but so tough that you couldn't even cut it with a knife. It was very chewy. The only shrimp I could find was some small, deep fried, and some peel and eat. They were both mediocre. The mashed potatoes were good. Stuffing was dried out. The chicken taco meat was old and dried out. Mac and cheese was dried out and crunchy. I could keep going, but you get the point. We tried telling the manager, and he was making excuses and very dismissive. So we paid $80 for 4 sodas and mashed potatoes....",

Can beat a breakfast buffet price that is currently at $6.99 per person and actually taste really good? What's even better is that you can finish off your meal with not just ice cream like most buffet, but gelato and make is a shake. The only thing I really miss about this place was that years ago, they use to serve stir fried crab legs that is the absolute best crab legs I've ever had.   Word of advice. If you are planning on getting here for breakfast or for lunch, get here early. Lunch technically starts at 11:30 but people are lining up since 9:30 and can take you more than an hour just waiting in line just to get in.  Update: On Fridays, they do have seafood night where they will stir fry your crab legs with spicy sauces. Happiness returns!",

Fore the second pass, I had Mongolian grilled assorted seafood with snow peas, garlic, chili paste, fresh chopped garlic, mushrooms, and baby corn.  I got it done with the garlic, chili sauce and it was excellent with a good amount of spiciness.  It could have had a bit more zing!  Dessert was a strawberry milkshake and a piece of chocolate cake.  I really like this buffet as a change.  They have dishes here that aren't served at Red Rock, so it's a treat to make the trek to Henderson now and then to eat here.

You grab a plate of crab legs and they saute it for you with tomatoes, garlic, butter, onions and chili. This is the best part and crab legs are addictive as Hell!  The Mongolian grill was great as well. You can choose between beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, Korean ribs, or seafood. There are an abundance of sauces to choose from as well.  Prime rib was above average. The dessert selection was limited but delicious.  If you have access to a car in Vegas, next time save yourself some dough and enjoy this underrated buffet.",

It's smaller but has just enough food.  For the 2 of us it was like $16 [with the coupon] so like $8.00 each.  I had a make your own taco which had all the fixins and was delicious.  They had a whole carving station spread complete with turkey, ham, and beef. Baked potatoes, gratin potatoes, mashed potatoes, my stomach just growled thinking about it. My friend showed up with a Thanksgiving meal on his plate covered in gravy that just made me lol'd and smh!   Chinese food was good too not too salty just right, fried shrimp, salad bar, and a large selection of desserts that I steered clear of :)  Go it's good and it's reasonably priced!",

I hear the one at M is good too so I plan to try that one day too.  Anyways....  Waited about 20 minutes... we got there at like noon for a $6.99 lunch.  So, figures there'd be a wait.  For the price and considering it includes our soft drinks.... I gave this 4 stars for price, value and selection.  They don't have their crab or shrimp selections... but that's cuz it's $6.99.  But really enjoyed what they did have.  They have a nice selection of Italian, American, Mexican and Asian fare.  I did more Asian fare this time.  Mixed green salad with cranberries, pecans and blue cheese... YUM!  Went back for seconds.  Chef's salad - YUM!  It was a bit of mystery salad but then we found out the base was barley which I thought was different... it had chopped apples, cranberries, nuts, corn and all sorts of stuff in it... and the textures and taste really worked.  Who Knew!?  Chinese stir fry green beans - YUM!  a tad oily but not salty and not soggy.... it's a buffet ...I can't be overly picky, right  Eggroll - crispy on the outside, meaty with nice veggies on the inside  Tofu - light... what can I say... it's Tofu... and I don't normally eat it but thought I might as well try it.... it was in a light soy/sweet sauce and the tofu was a little too watery for my taste.. but it's probably supposed to be that way  Bok Choy - eh! wasn't impressed  Red Bean puff thing - it was pretty good... I didn't know what it was but I like to try everything once.  It was covered with sesames on the outside and looked like a mini donut... tasted like a mini donut too with what I assume was Red Bean paste on the inside because it was not sweet but more savory-like.  Asian Pork BBQ - dry... didn't go back for seconds  Seabass - not melt-in-your-mouth-Chilean-Seabass.... but still good nonetheless.... light and buttery  Mongolian BBQ - didn't try it but it looked really good... maybe next time  Pecan / Florentine like cookie/cake dessert - SO GOOD!  Chocolate covered Macaroon - Wow!  It was rich! You had better like coconut and ... one bit was all I needed to have my sweet tooth satisfied.  Tiramisu shooter - OK... it tasted more like vanilla pudding and the bread / cake part was tasteless.",

    "text": "There was a time when I'd proudly bring \"out of towners\", here anytime of the day or night and not fear crappy typical casino buffet. However, that's not the case anymore, this morning being proof positive of that. First, they're \"giving away\" a free buffet at breakfast or lunch to some locals with players cards.  We cruised in for breakfast about 9:30, not too busy and lots of staff on hand.  This food was so bad it exceeded the Fiesta buffet in low quality slop.  If you're going to give locals something to get them in to spend $,  it should be edible.  Scrambled eggs were soupy and by the time I got to them they were gone. I will post a pic I took after pointing out to one of the workers at the buffet that we were all waiting for her to finish her convo with another worker and get some freakin eggs.  There's no protein which isn't pork except teriyaki chicken (I'm dead serious)  so the mountain of bacon which they added to, even after it was toppling over and the grey sausage (browned would be good, right?) are all you get.  I don't eat pork so I was relegated to eating eggs & potatoes.  All forms of potatoes were so greasy it was disgusting and pancakes were burned and akin to a sports discus in texture & hardness. Took a pic of the uncooked corn beef hash which looked like dog food according to another guest who was waiting with me for scrambled eggs!  Where is the management and quality control here?  It was not worth eating for free and that's sad! Omelette's were offered but the other food was so disgusting that the line was 10 people long, I don't know, add another omelette person to the mix from the group which stands around socializing?",

Also, for the month of August, they have a 2-for-1 special going on for Boarding Pass members.  What I *hate* is the awful line and wait. My family got to the buffet line at around 5:10pm (pretty early for dinner) and we didn't get seated until 6:20pm!!! This is pretty standard as I have waited similar times in the past but UGH, I'm hungry!!!!  Not only are you waiting in the 3rd class stewage line (not staying at the hotel or have mucho $$$ to upgrade your Boarding pass) you have to compete with the lines of the hotel guests and Stations High Rollers to get a seat!  I read from previous yelp posts that they do not have enough servers to fulfill the demand. UH! Vegas is one of the most unemployed cities, open up these serving jobs so I can stuff myself and dance in gluttony faster!!!!",

Keep your expectations in check as this is not going to be a high end gourmet buffet and you will be happy.  The Friday night crab leg buffet is incredibly funny to watch gluttons of people pile on double fisted mountains of crab legs on plates of made to order sauteed crab legs in a delicious burnt garlic chili paste green onion mixture. It's truly funny to watch the spectacle of people fighting in line for crab legs, that unfortunately come short of quality in that the legs rarely get a clean break from the meat so it is extremely cumbersome to pick the meat out.   I come here during breakfast or lunch simply because it is priced well for locals.",

Today I had about my worst service experience,  which will probably mark my last visit to The Feast Buffet. I waited over 15 minutes for drinks. When we went for more food we came back to find out table covered in used drink cups, plates and food spilled on out table. Looked like they were just thrown there, rather gross. The table next to use experienced the same thing. Quality of the food is not great and the service was terrible. Needless to say this marks the second time in my life I did not leave a tip.",

It does not take too long to sign up BUT the lines for the buffet will be long so get there early!  I waited at the Green Valley Ranch location for up to an hour before finally piling food onto my plate.  In other words, if you want the breakfast buffet special, arrive AT LEAST 2 hours before the transition to lunch time, just to be safe.  So what about the buffet lunch recommendations?  Pizza, Mongolian Chow Mein, salmon, french fries, any fresh meat cuts, potato, and salad.  What you really don't need at the buffet:  Pasta, tacos, and fortune cookies (unless you really want your fortune before gambling)  Dessert wise  I say try any of it, at least a scoop of gelato if they have it.  Other than that, if you want to save money but still want pretty good, if not exceptional food for the price, definitely come by one of these buffets!",

I am a local and my out of town guests always want to go to buffets. There are so many choices for locals and this is the most disappointing experience I've had since moving here. It's embarrassing to have to apologize to your friends for bringing them to a sub par buffet. I wrote an email to let the casino know about this experience and no response.

    "text": "In my continuing effort to eat at every buffet in Las Vegas, we finally checked out the Feast Buffet @ Green Valley Ranch Resort and Casino.    Another challenge I have is to never pay for a buffet.  Luckily, we gambled enough ahead of time to earn enough credit to pay with our reward points.  It also was 10x's earned reward points day so that helped.  However, if I had to pay for it, this one isn't as expensive as those on the strip.    It was a Wednesday afternoon so no fancy lobster/seafood like on the weekends.  Just a regular buffet.  What we found was your basic run of the mill American cafe with Americanized International Flavors thrown in.  For example, Orange Chicken in the Asian section.  Now I happen to love Orange Chicken so that's not a bad thing for me, but don't expect Wicked Spoon or Bellagio gourmet buffet recipe's here.    Now that you know what you're walking into, the food is pretty good.  I always test the pizza and this one passed by taste test.  They also had chocolate cream pie for dessert, another indulgence I only do at buffet's.    As for service, they do a good job although it's pretty much a going through the motions feel.  They deliver what the need to and another more.  They get an additional star for filling my diet coke before my current one was empty.  Although, I have to admit, I hardly drink out of my refill.  I just need a glass about 8oz larger and I'd be good for the entire meal.  And for some reason, that's universal of all buffet's.  Don't ask me why.   Since we live in Orange County, CA, we stopped by on the way back home as it's close enough to I15 to spend a few hours after we've checked out of our hotel on the Strip.  It just might become our go-to leaving strategy.  It all depends on what offers we might get in the mail now that we've played there a bit because again, I don't like to pay for my food in Vegas.",

With a significant price increase, the food taste quality has not followed.   For all the crab leg fanatics, that fell in love with their sauteed version, those days are gone.  I went there in Oct, Nov, and Dec of 2018 and it was great!   To give you a brief history, original (elder) woman, that probably helped start the recipe, is no longer around.   The cooks that took her place took a while to get it right, but they finally did.     Now, they have started a new tactic where they have the crab sauteed for you on the line.   You can't ask for spicy and you can't add shrimp into it.  Maybe this is an attempt to cut costs with portion control or to alleviate the long lines, I don't know.  So what's my assessment?  My crab was cold and it didn't have much flavor.  In short, I was completely disappointed.  There was no point in complaining because for this to happen, I feel that they have lost a lot of pride in taste quality.",

    "text": "Definitely wasn't expecting quality like the higher end hotels, but had my hopes up for something better than a Hometown or Asia buffet since it is inside the Green Valley Resort... and this one just felt like a regular buffet in the neighborhood.   The line wasn't so bad for a Sunday around 1PM, dining room doesn't look busy but we were in line for a good 30-45 minutes. Not sure why. Your most basic buffet food, Italian section with some pastas, meatballs, and pizza. Mongolian food. Turkey carving station. Four choices of Asian entrees. Mexican station, which I have to highlight that I really enjoyed the churros. Food creeping and saw some tables that had some Korean short ribs, went back to the buffet but it was no where to be found. Also saw a guy with a freshly made burger, so we asked, and the chefs behind the grill actually makes them if you request it... apparently you can have a lot of things cooked per order here, just no signage... AKA SECRET MENU! LOL. Dessert is the basic desserts in a cup, sliced cakes, cookies, and soft serve. The green tea ice cream was actually good.   Our server was great. She was very attentive and kept our drinks filled even without us asking. Overall experience was eh, okay. $20 Sunday champagne brunch. I would've been okay paying $12 because of the selection and quality of food for this buffet but I guess the extra $8 is for the unlimited mimosas. LOL. If you have time, get the Player's Club card, gets you $2 off your buffet. So $17.99 for the Sunday champagne brunch.",

However, I will say that for the price point you get exactly what you should.   No it's not fancy but I've never had a major issue with quality.   Not everything is perfect all the time but can you really expect that?   The lines are usually pretty long on holidays and such but they move fairly fast on the weekends.     The service isn't terrible and most of the people who work here are very friendly and accommodating.     I wouldn't tell you to make a special trip just to come to this buffet but if you're in the area or if you get discounts like I do then it's definitely worth it.",

Loved the Mongolian. Just wish the short ribs had more meat than fat on them. Same thing with the beef I had they put in my mix. It was different. Had a texture of ground beef but when it was stuck together, it was way too chewy. Just beware of it. It ya great flavor though!   Mashed was good. Macaroni and cheese had a very dark orange color to it. Tasted like bread crumbs.   Sushi looked like it was out for hours so I didn't even mess with it.

Sadly, the eggplant is no longer there, but the menudo is still around. We used to spread our trips around to the other Feasts, but lately, Sunset and Red Rock have not been up to par. We tried GVR to see if they were still great (and we had 2 comped buffets). We were not disappointed. The food was great, the service top notch and selection outstanding. The only reason I go with 4 instead of 5 starts is the missing eggplant and the small selection of grilled or steamed veggies...I usually go for the meat and potatoes type things, but the missus loves vegetables.  GVR has still got a handle on how to do a Feast Buffet right!!",

Here's the problem: Most of the food tastes like it came from the frozen section of the grocery store and was zapped in a microwave. Dry, lacking flavor, and totally uninspired. I guess you get what you pay for.  To boot, the seating process stunk. Half the dining area was empty but there were still huge lines. Also, the seater would pull 2 parties at a time from the general line but then only 1 from each of the hotel guest/Platinum and President/Chairman lines, so those lines were actually far slower. I'm certainly not one for elitism, but if they're going to do it this way, they might as well just have a single line for everybody.  At least when we got seated, the waitress was pretty good about keeping our drinks topped up. For what it is, I think this buffet deserves around a 1.5, so I'm going to round up my review to 2 just because of her.  I remember several years ago when the food here was actually good. They charged more, but at least the food was far better. Frankly, even if I were staying at GVR or lived in the area, I'd rather drive to the Strip and pay $10+ more for a real breakfast buffet that deserves my time.",

The wait was not THAT long and our server was prompt and it went down hill from there.  90 % of the  tags THAT said what food was WHERE  missing and the other 10% were  breakfast.now BE ING A VEgatarian. That is very bad news for me.  I spoke to a manager who didn't seem to care and then as I was taking photos of the breakfast signs she came up and asked what I was doing so I explained.   Feeling frustrated at her poor excuse of why the signs were missing.  The chef had an emergency and had to leave, I called the Food and beverage director. No response for a week so I called back.  He seemed to care and asked if he could buy our next meal so I said sure. And gave him my address and repeated it.  Well a month later no free food passes. ... like promised.  And I WILL NOT EVER GO BACK. NOT ONLY because I exspected more from.a higher end Station casino but I was lied to  by the main chef.. SMH",

My only complaint, they charge full price for children 2 and up.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter had four bites of pizza and crackers for her \"dinner\".  Certainly not worth $15.  It would be nice if Station Casinos would add a \"kid price\" to their buffet.  I don't know any child under 5 years old who could eat $15 worth of food.  The staff is always friendly, always smiling.  Honestly, the staff is my favorite part of visiting any Stations Casino.",

I paid $13.99 with a players card.  I did not see a price list anywhere in line or at the register.  They were located in the Green Valley Ranch Resort and Spa in Henderson, NV.  The seating area was overcrowded with tables.  There were not adequate walk areas from our table to the buffet areas.  Service was a little slow to clear our empty plates and to get drink refills.  I was a little disappointed with the dessert selection.  The pies and cakes were on little plates.  There was not any flan or creme brulee.  The cheesecake was good.    Nothing was really outstanding.  I probably wouldn't come back and wait in line for so long.",

I did like the multiple chef stations which included the usual carving station, a noodle station, and a pasta station.  Also, the salad bar had quite a few items including baby corn so I was happy with my salad.  On to the food.  Definitely disappointing.  The knishes were inedible, the potato pancakes nothing like a True latke and were severely undercooked. I hate the taste of raw potato.  The corned beef was actually pretty good although dried out a bit from the warming lamps.  The matzoh ball soup was dishwater with a grainy but fluffy matzoh ball.  The rest of the food was mediocre and even the fruit seemed a little less than fresh.  The selections are limited and some things seem out of place such as the sushi and shrimp being at the salad bar.  For desert, the chef was helpful in cutting fresh pieces for customers and the few items sampled were good.  They don't have a large variety of ice cream flavors but the vanilla ice cream tasted good, similar to bryers.  This place is not worth a return trip.",

The mapo dubu (tofu in a mild chili sauce) in the chinese food area was pretty good & the salad bar was fresh.  I'd say the buffet was better than The Silverton when they have promos going on but not as good as the buffet at Red Rock Resort, another station casino.

They were accommodating, but couldn't fit us all in one table, which was fine because we came as a group of 21, which we had a kids and adult table. The service was EXCELLENT, which we had a Filipino waiter and he was entertaining. The food was your normal buffet food. Depending on how many buffets you have eaten, this one is worth it for the money that you pay. Your sweet tooth will definitely be satisfied with their ice creams. Get there early because the line will get long. Overall, It was a great buffet experience for Vegas.",

We were here for a basketball tournament with fellow teammates' families, and I wasn't expecting much for the $16.99 Saturday lunch price given that Vegas buffets are pretty pricey.  I personally had a much better dining experience (even ignoring price) over the last buffet I had at Aria. I loved the selection of protein and veggies in particular.  There were many choices of lean protein (like fish) and cooked veggies from many cuisine styles that was lacking at Aria.  I guess you get much better values off the strip.  My son even loved the dessert section better and inhaled his apple pie in about 30 seconds flat! :)",

Needless to say the closing time shows as 9PM but that doesn't mean that they close at 9 and then let you eat and hang out.   First, if you aren't in line by 8:30 PM then you can't get in.  We snuck in line but discovered that the prices on the board by the line have a big stinking disclaimer that they are special prices not what regular Joe pays.  $25.99 on Saturday night if you need to know.  The problem is, even if you get to the register by 9PM it'll take them 5-10 minutes to seat you and then we were told that by 9:45 they cut you off. Who wants to pay $26 for a 30 minute buffet?  But this is near Las Vegas AND a Saturday night...how can they close at 9:45 or 9PM (whatever closing time is supposed to be).  Given the cut off I decided to skip it.",

Its the money that you pay into it . It is actually pretty decent and good. Yes there will be days that'll perhaps be a hit and miss but overall it is pretty good. BUT here is the best part why it is really 4 stars..... feast buffets in all station casinos offer  a 2 for 1 buffet . (Don't forget they also have Military Mondays ) Pretty much all the time specially for locals and a lot of times they also offer this promos to guests from out of town to include rooms. I don't think i ever paid for 2 people here but there is always 2 of us that come here. For some  locals  you might wanna check with the rewards card booth for promos that'll be beneficial for every visit you go to any station casinos. And NO, you do not have to be a gambler to get this offer. Questions ? Happy Feast !",

They said it was greatly priced, well staffed and delicious food! I think they should have said all that times 10! My only little advice would be a tad better control up front at the register, it seemed like it was short staffed. The cashier was working multiple sides of the counter and it was a little confusing- but that didn't take away from the 5 stars, I mean all places have rough nights! We had grandma in a wheel chair and they were so accommodating to that! They found ya a nice place to sit, took our drinks and off we went to explore! Everything we ate was fantastic! Great cuts of roast beef, pork tenderloin, sausages- and other meats as well! Mongolian grill, Asian, Italian (the ravioli in pesto were to die for), burger bar and of course deserts!  Our waitress was on top do drinks and my husband took advantage of the $10 all you can drink domestics and wine! They had Coors Stubbies, so that was pretty awesome! All around great pricing, great food and a wonderful- accommodating staff! I would definitely return!",

    "text": "The Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch.  Breakfast - 3.75 stars.  They have all the best breakfast items plus a little more.  However, their biscuits are not quite as fluffy and nice as the ones at Red Rock.  I really wish they had more fruit.  For the price though ($8.99), its hard to beat.  Lunch - 3.5 stars.  They have pretty much everything you could want and I love that they have menudo (for my husband), posole (for me) and sesame balls for both of us (and they are good too).  I will say that weekend lunch/brunch seemed better in quality of food (higher turn over?).  It hit the spot, but I would rather go to Red Rock; they had more grilled veggies and their salad bar is much bigger.  Dinner - 3.5 I've only done the seafood Friday dinner thus far.  I really loved the crab that was steamed (in all the variations).  They also had a good selection of non-seafood items.    Dessert - I'm a fan, for lunch the other day they had coconut macaroons (I could eat my weight in those) and I'm all for just about any type of bread pudding with vanilla sauce.  Cookies?  Yes please  All in all, this is a smaller buffet than some of the other station casinos.  I really wish they would make their salad bar bigger.  A good portions of the front is taken up by fake display food.  It would be nice if they took that area and added more salads like farro or quinoa as well as more fresh fruit.  I'm sure I'll got back for breakfast, though I think we might try other buffets for lunch and dinner in the future.",

    "text": "We have been coming here for a while now. Not a bad place for a place to dine in especially if you get the specials like 2 for 1 special on the buffet. Went for the lunch couple times and the seafood night which I say Is worth it. I like the customer service which they are helpful and nice on a good day majority of the time they have to be nice because it's part of the job. Parking is alright. The food can get boring if you go multiple times. So you have to plan it out so you don't get bored eating the same food. Top note, I like the bread pudding that they serve. Put the vanilla sauce and a scoop of ice cream and it's to die for.",

    "text": "Feast your eyes on the variety that comprises this buffet. Vegas is like a giant buffet of buffets. You can eat all you can eat at all the all you can eat buffets (I dare you to say that five times fast) for 10 years and never get to them all. For the money (and laid back atmosphere) this all you can eat buffet is the tops for me.   Feast is located in Green Valley Ranch, which is a pretty, upscale resort in Henderson. It's off the strip, so you can relax, park for free, and walk right into the casino. The area is beautiful with high end shopping, houses, and scenery.   If you are signed up for the member card for Station Casinos the pricing is excellent for what you get. It's tiered, but lunch is typically $10.99 and dinner is $16.99.  Sometimes I think they should rename this place Variety (I know, it's the Modus Operandi of every buffet, but their selection is truly excellent) Every day the menu features a selection of meats (brisket, pot roast, roasted turkey, fresh sausages etc.). They have your typical salad and fruit bar, and pasta salads. They have fresh sushi, a mongolian bbq area (really cool), a fresh pasta station and then selections of fish, shrimp, Italian fare and even fresh chili verde or fajitas in their line. Desert is no different. They have hand scooped and soft serve ice cream and all the cakes, pies, brownies, and cookies you could imagine. It's like every kid's wildest food dream (or overgrown kid, whatever).  They also have great family seating and excellent wait service. Just remember to bring some cash to tip the bbq cooks and ice cream scoopers.",

    "text": "A very good \"off the strip\" buffet. Friday and Saturday night are probably the best nights if you like prime rib and seafood.  The other nights are also very good. They will have different specials, so you might luck into bbq night which is very good. I highly recommend the beef brisket!    They offer a complete salad bar, sushi, fresh fruit, soups, nachos, Italian fare, pizza, tacos, tamales, mashed potatoes, veggies, hot and cold shrimp, fish, Asian dishes and a very nice stir fry area where you select what you want and they make it while you wait.   Then the dessert bar is very nice! Several pies, pastries, cookies, cobblers, hand dipped ice cream, sundaes, frozen yogurt and sugar free options to choose from.   There is definitely something for everyone here.",

It wasn't too busy and we were seated after about 15 minutes, which was fine.   The food sucked. It's never been as bad as it was today. The carving station meat all tasted of chemicals, almost like a gasoline taste. The salad station was the only decent thing to eat. The egg rolls were flavorless. The soup was horrible. The tamales were dried out. The ice cream was out.   I ordered a Bloody Mary and I don't know what they gave me. It was awful, all tomato juice and pepper. The servers were pretty rude too when it came to drinks, we have never been served the way we were today.   Highly disappointed in the buffet today, I wouldn't recommend it. We left hungry.",

    "text": "Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch is probably one of my favorite buffets in the valley. However, I ONLY come here for dinner on Friday nights and I ONLY come here if I have a coupon. When you have their player's card and you gamble every now and then, they will send you coupons for the buffet. There's one where you play 100 points and get a free buffet. Then there's another one where it's 2-for-1 buffet. If you do get the coupons, remember to look at the dates! They don't work for every week!  Friday nights are seafood nights! I think it's the only night where they offer crab legs. If you have a player's card, it's about $38-40 per person. Without the card, it's a few dollars pricier. So if you're over 21, just get the player's card to save a few collars. Oh, they also give you a free drink! Wine wine, red wine, Zinfandel wine, or Moscato! Awesome!   What's different about them is that they have a station where they will sautee the crab legs with tomatos, chilis, chilantro, and garlic. It's super delicious. You don't have to get it sauteed with everything either -- you can just do garlic if you want :) It doesn't have to be crab legs either! They do shrimp too! You have to grab the crab legs/shrimp before going to them to get it sauteed though.   That is pretty much the only thing I really eat at this buffet. They have made to order burgers at the magnolian station. The magnolian station is pretty nice too. Grab yourself a bowl, fill it with whatever you want, give it them with your selection of meat and sauce, and wha-la, you'll have a nice plate of stir fried yumminess.   Plus! This past visit, they actually had these Chinese dessert, which were sesame balls with red bean paste inside. They were delicious because they were freshly made! That was the first time I've seen them there... what a surprise!   The dessert selection is pretty minimal but they always have fruits, which are a healthy alternative. Otherwise, I would say, get yourself some bread pudding, top it with ice cream, and drizzle it with vanilla sauce!   Great deal when you have a coupon! :)",

At the ham craving station, I had to stand for a while and no one came. Finally the one lady sliced some off. Ham, omelet and potatoes good. Bacon not.

Carved brisket was good as was the fried chicken and lemon chicken. Good pork ribs and some good Chinese dishes. Some great desserts and ice cream.  Pies and layer cakes. You can look it up, but everything was top quality and fresh. It was a delight to eat and gave us tremendous enjoyment. Have to add that the waitress was a sweetheart.

As to the rest of the food - it was tasty- good. i really liked the menudo tripe soup, the sweet and sour fried fish w the chunks of pineapple, fried chicken was a little too salty for me and i couldn't find the thighs, the sushi is there for show (not great), i tried a little bit of everything that caught my attention. i wish i had more room for that bread pudding. i know you are probably thinking - bread pudding?!?! yes, their bread pudding i bet is being made by a nonna at the back. start with it.",

We went about 10:15 a.m. and they change over to lunch at 10:45 so we got the best of both worlds, breakfast and lunch. And non-alcoholic beverages are included in your meal. The only negative I could say was that a few of the dishes like Spanish rice and potato latke we're not real warm. I guess they were changing over to lunch shortly and didn't want to add more hot food to the existing. Overall I can say there was quite a bit for a vegetarian to eat.",

My shortest wait was a half hour, longest wait was an HOUR. I waited an hour last time for the brunch buffet. Endless mimosas come with the purchase of your buffet which is awesome. Except they're not endless.  I got my first plate and drank my first mimosa, fully expecting to come back with my second plate and see another mimosa waiting for me. Well, I sat down to the same empty glass. \"Ok\" I told myself \"maybe they thought we left no big deal they'll fill it now that I'm seated\" I finished my second plate in about ten minutes and still... Empty mimosa glass. I saw people coming around and picking up plates/cleaning tables but no one filling glasses.  I got my dessert plate, sat down, and saw someone walking around with a bottle of champagne. great! I'll at least get a second drink! Well, no that never happened. The person filled pretty much everyone else's glasses except mine, I took a bite of my cake, and left. We waited in line an hour, spent probably 45 minutes inside, and I got 1 mimosa.  Advice to the establishment not that it matters because you'll get people to dine here regardless: if you advertise ENDLESS MIMOSAS, don't let an empty glass sit there for well over a half hour...",

We did that and the weekday lunch buffet was $10 instead of regular $15 per person.   Went to Feast Buffet at Green Valley location for Monday lunch buffet. Parking was free and it plenty of spots were there.   Casino staff were super friendly and when asked for directions instead of just showing directions they walked us there itself. That was really nice gesture.   Went around 2pm on Monday. Just 6 families in front of us in the line. We were seated in less than 5 minutes and within seconds the waiter came to our table and took our drinks order too.    There were seven different food sections: Chinese , Mongolian grill, International (Spanish ), American, Italian, Salads & Desserts.  All the food were tasty.  For seafood they had Bass  which was awesome and some other fish in Chinese section. They smoked bean was also very tasty. Most of the items we tried were amazing.   Will definitely go to Feast Buffet again. Worth the visit.",

I mean the food is hit and miss for me. There are some things I really do like and somethings I will never put in my mouth again. For the price it is definitely a decent meal.  Cons:  The line is always wrapped halfway around the casino to get in... Like seriously? Calm down this inst Disneyland.  The service is very sub-par. Sometimes we go through an entire meal without ever getting a refill or seeing our server again. This is a biggie for me because I can go from 0-Grouch real quick if I'm thirsty.

In past they had sushi, they should not wait til lunch to put it out if they are charging a brunch prices for the whole timeframe.  My whole point is if you say brunch is this time to that time, the menu should be the same the whole time.",

    "text": "Have to update this and increase my star rating.    I've since been here for lunch and dinner as well as holiday brunches and it's always been an excellent meal.    The food options at this buffet are terrific.  My favorite is the Mongolian wok.  I think that alone is worth the price of the whole buffet!    Even the gelato milkshakes for dessert are heavenly!    The price is great if you're a boarding pass member.  They send buy one get one coupons almost monthly.  My biggest gripe is the line.  It can be flat out awful.  I've waited almost an hour to get in there on a Sunday night.  You have to make sure you're not starving when you arrive, otherwise you'll just be cranky and pissed once you get your table.  Other than the line, this is one of my favorite buffets around!",

The only thing holding me back is they tend to be either ridiculously inexpensive or free and I am ridiculously cheap, or as I prefer, frugal.  This morning I managed to stuff myself with OJ, fresh melon, ambrosia, ham, Brussel sprouts, easy over eggs and my 2 Las Vegas guilty pleasures - bacon and corned beef hash.  Everything was satisfactory without anything standing out.",

The Feast Buffet is inside the Green Valley Ranch Resort & Casino. It is a display of different dishes mainly Chinese, Mongolian, Mexican, Italian, American. It includes a salad bar with all the works, breakfast dishes , and great choices of roasted meats. A full dessert bar of all your favorite cakes, cheesecakes, puddings cookies, ice cream, soft serve.  My tiramisu was missing on the dessert line and I was a little disappointed so I opted for a combination ice cream mixed together like the Cold Stone Creamery style. I love the mimosa! This place is  the most reasonable priced Sunday brunch I've been to with a full scale of great tasting dishes and great choices available for everyone! Despite the traffic this place gets, service is a thumbs up. I am rating their Sunday Brunch a 5 star for  price (I think it is under priced), menu choices, quality of the food, service, dining interior and decor.",

I hate having to fork out a ton of cash to cover the cost of the gluttonous jerks who pile their plates up with the legs of 40 crabs in a night.   My sister and I had to wait maybe 20 minutes to get up to the register and less than 5 to get seated. I had the turkey, gravy and small sweet potato which were good. I asked for the skin as well which tasted a little funky. The stuffing tasted like flour and the mac and cheese was so bad, I couldn't finish it.  I had three fried shrimp which were decent, the ranch salad which was eh, a slice of the veggie pizza which was good, half of the toppings off a slice of mushroom pizza - bleh, two \"bowls\" of lox topped with fresh purple onion, cream cheese and capers. YUM!   I also tried a bite of bread pudding which tasted like raw pancake batter so I spit it out, a few bites over under-ripe watermelon, a couple bites of soft-serve vanilla custard which was too sweet, a bite of chocolate cream pie but tasted like pudding, and a bite of really delish cheesecake.   Service was fast but I tried too many things I didn't like. It's a more upscale version of the buffet at Sunset Station.",

It's hard to really mess up bacon, sausage, and waffles. The selection was underwhelming. There were the items to make eggs Benedict but the hollandaise sauce looked lumpy and thereby sketchy. Today is a travel day so I didn't dare brave that. The dessert section was very underwhelming and looked like it was made by a high school home economics class. The pie was cut haphazardly and the cakes all leaned. The donuts looked dry and the crisp appeared to be missing fruit. For $8.99 ($1 discount with the rewards card) it was ok but nothing to write home about. This was not worth the stop, even if you don't consider the truly wonderful strip buffets you can find. There are plenty of other dining options at GVR, and I suggest any of those.",

The selection is pretty decent also for the pricing.    There is an sections for Italian, American, Mongolian, Chinese, Mexican a carving station , salad bar, and a dessert bar.  Our wait staff has been efficient and our plates and drinks refilled without asking every time we have dined here, (dinner only) which has been about 6 times in the last 30 days.  The won ton soup is actually edible, with the won tons not being overly pasty or foul tasting like I have experienced at several other buffets.  They also offer free house wine which is actually pretty good.  If you want a decent selection with decent quality, try this buffet.",

I have never seen this kind of section in any buffet.  I thought this was interesting.  They had the normal roast beef, prime rib, and ham.  They also had mongolian bbq.

Yeah, I know that if I had a pass, the price would be $13.99, but the in-laws forgot their card, so we had to pay full price.  Granted the meal does come with champagne/mimosa, which is a plus, but they had the same old boring choice of food...breakfast items, chinese food, salad bar, etc. The prime rib wasn't even tender and flavorful.  Perhaps if they had the famous crab legs that I have seen other Yelpers rave about, I would give them higher marks.  But alas, they weren't serving the crab legs on the Sunday I went.  Also, their desserts were pretty cheesy...donuts, pie, and cookies...I expected more.  Their gelato wasn't even good either.  I think that the buffet at M Resort is a better buffet for the price and they even have AYCD alcholic beverages.  Sorry Feast Buffet, it will be my first and last time I dine here.",

SO glad that I did. :) First stop CRAB - plated it and handed it to the nice lady behind the grill where she grilled it with tomato,garlic, thai chile, butter and cilantro.  Messy but so freaking good that you can't help but eat til you make your self sick  I also got some shrimp done this way... kind of a spicy shrimp scampi if you will.  They had some Oktoberfest foods on the line ... pretzels with mustard sauce (pretzel good sauce sucked)  red cabbage, brats and sauerkraut.  fun times. For some reason I only allow myself to have a small amount of potatos here ( normally I don't eat them at all) but there is something about them and the turkey gravy that satiates a need.  We got there about 4 pm and the line moved fast.  Enjoyed the food and our server was phenomenal - if you put your plate to the side it was gone before you could blink. ( can she come work at my house please I am adopting) GREAT meal soooo delish ..  Yes I will be back ... again and again ... and again.",

We went on a Sunday night at dinnertime and there was a 45 minute wait in line in the way-too-smoky casino.  We'll be back though!",

Also, the entrees were delicious...I especially liked the baked brisket and pasta selections.   To top it off, the price here won't break the bank....get a Preferred card and buffet meals are half the cost.  I'm looking forward to going back for dinner tonight!",

However, with the local discount I think I'd prefer the Carnival World buffett at the Rio which I think is very similar only with more to choose from. It was nearly two years ago since we went to the Rio so I could be wrong. I just remember the Rio had Lasanga which I thought was quite good for a buffett.",

Granted, its not great wine, but its palatable and its free. My boyfriend likes to gamble at GVR and usually gets several 2-1 coupons during the month; so we eat here quite often. I know it'll take 45 minutes to an hour to be seated, even if there's less than 30 people in line, so I usually bring a book and read in line while he continues to gamble.  I once asked the cashier why it took so long and she said they didn't have enough servers, so they try to stagger the diners.  The food at Sunset Station is the same and the lines move 10 times faster.",

Sarah A mentioned crab legs... they actually haven't had crab legs in over a year since they lowered the price.  The crab legs really used to be the big draw here, but sadly no more.  It's still good though and well worth the $14.  One of the highlights now is the mongolian station where you can also get Kalbi Beef Korean short ribs, along with the normal mongolian stir fry choices.  There's the typical Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and American stations.  And they also have a decent dessert variety with plenty of NSA items as well.",

I now realized I'd rather get one or two GOOD quality delicious items at places like Bread and Butter or Greens and Proteins then bunch of crap that this buffet was dishing out. This one is located inside of Green Valley Ranch and hence my expectation of higher quality food. WRONG.  Everything I tried tasted microwaved or stuff you could find at the grocery store. Some items were down right inedible. I had a piece of bbq chicken (I have found better quality at Vons), cheese ravioli that tastes so doughy and disgusting, mac and cheese which was decent but only because of the overpowering fake cheddar cheese out a jar that I used to love as a kid. The orange chicken was mushy and slathered in gross corn starchy syrup deeming it inedible, and the tofu was a mushy mess. The dessert section looked like grocery store bakery rejects. Never again.",

Now, seriously, the crab isn't that good.  But for an all-you-can-eat deal, what do you expect?  Some of my family think it's awesome and just eat plate after plate of crab.  I might sample a leg or two until I remember why I only ever have a leg or two.  But the other stuff, for buffet food, is pretty great.  Their omelets at the omelet station are always tasty.  Pretty much good breakfast stuff all around (I'm a sucker for their biscuits and gravy).  The salad bar is plentiful and fresh and they always have a prime rib and turkey breast out to be carved.  The quality of everything is consistent visit after visit.",

Had family come in from Denmark and my wife just wanted to visit and not eat. Spoke with management and they did not give us an exception to their policy which cost me $11 for my wife to visit family or maybe I should think that it cost me $22 for lunch. I can see that they cannot monitor every who doesn't eat at a buffet and understand somewhat. But I didn't appreciate the way in which they handled the situation. I think the management needs some training in customer service rather than just restating their policy repeatedly. Not sure we will return any time soon even with a coupon.

Friday and Saturday nights are Surf and Turf nights from 3:30 pm to 10 pm, which ultimately means AYCE crab legs and whole roasted pigs.  It's normally $21.99/pp or $19.99/pp with a Stations Boarding Pass.  But for the month of November, an additional $3 is discounted - making dinner $16.99/pp!  (And with my coupon in the mail for BOGO free buffet - that meant $16.99 for two people!  What a deal!)  The line was already long when we approached the restaurant a bit after 4 pm.  It didn't take too long for the line to get moving though.    There were hoardes of people in line for the crab - specifically the steamed crab legs.  But then there was this other line - you can have them stir-fry your crab legs however you'd like.  Ultimately, you grab your crab legs (or other food items), and then tell them what sauce you like and how spicy.  You can skip the wait and get cold crab legs and it's all the same.  This is what everyone swears by and the reason the Feast Buffet at GVR does well!    Other unique items at this buffet worth mentioning were the clams on the half shell, something I couldn't indulge in sadly enough.    But they do have milkshakes to order, which I was more than happy to help myself to!   Other useful buffet info:  Breakfast: Monday - Friday: 8am - 11am $7.99 per person or $6.99 with Boarding Pass Card  Brunch: Saturday - Sunday: 8am - 3:30pm $20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass Card AYCE crab legs  Lunch: Monday - Friday: 11am - 2:30pm $10.99 per person or $9.99 with Boarding Pass Card  Dinner: Sunday - Thursday: 3:30pm - 10pm $20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass Card AYCE crab legs",

When you walk right in you are greeted with a huge fake fruit and veggie stand. They have prime rib, which they'll throw on the grill if you want it a little more well done, grilled salmon, some times lamb chops, a Mongolian station that also makes kalbi korean short ribs, some chinese, an italian station with made to order pasta dishes, soups and salads, and a pretty good selection of desserts, cakes, pies, ice cream, and milk shakes.   And they have crabs legs lots of them and they're huge. they have them hot, cold, and even made to your order, add garlic, green onions, chili peppers, various sauces, if they don't have it at the crab station but have in another go ahead an grab it and have them add it. i usually tell them to add everything and just make it not too spicy. I'll also just have the plain hot crabs legs, grabs some garlic, butter, shoyu (soy) and have the pasta station make a sauce from those ingredients without the crab, then grab a large plate of steamed rice and go to town. i always did it that way to lobster when i was back in Hawaii.   busy a lot of times so expect the wait. have someone wait in line, leave um there and go do your thing. if their hungry they'll have no problems with waiting.",

Highlights are an omelette station, good bagels with a variety of cream cheese flavors, fresh salads and pinto beans.  I am not very fond of the buffet experience because it always feels like a hassle to stand in the lines and wait for people to pick through whatever item and they seem to take sooooo long (sorry Mom, you are one of those people... the best tasting green bean is not hidden below the other 100 green beans in the same pan). Some of my food gets cold and I also have to walk past rude people that cough and sneeze without covering their nose or mouth.  It is also not very wheelchair friendly, they tried to seat us at an aisle table with my sister sitting in her wheelchair in the aisle. Nevermind that someone might bump into her in that narrow aisle or carry a plate over her head and drop it by accident. Negative star for the rude dinner hostess staff that rolled their eyes at us for wanting to wait for a different table.",

    "text": "Once again this buffet more than meets my expectations for a budget-priced buffet. All of the offerings are extremely fresh, there are some made-to-order stations & the selection is huge. Actually a nice place to take an out-of-town visitor if you don't want to spend an arm & a leg. You won't find shrimp or crab here during lunch, but there's always a nice fish offering on the Asian station. I was sad to see my favorite salad, bleu cheese & walnuts & cranberries, was no longer premade for me. They had all the ingredients in a separate area but I put too much salad dressing on & it didn't taste at all like my old favorite. Ahh...my other go-to, the red bean sesame balls, were still there, fresh out of the fryer, or wherever they come from.  Once again I was lucky enough to have a 2 for 1 coupon which made our breakfast/lunch $8! Gosh, taking that into consideration they deserve 5 stars!",

The runner-up would be the Italian section with the baked rigatoni and I usually put the meatballs over it. On Sunday they have the endless champagne brunch which only comes in at $17 so if you like to drink this is a steal of a deal. Lines aren't too bad on the weekend at Peak time you can expect to wait 20 to 25 minutes tops.",

The last time, we had fresh fish fillets, wok fried with no batter in the Asian section.  This time, there's battered fish with nasty sweet and sour sauce.  It looked like stuff that would be served at fast food joints, sitting under heat lamps.   The Mongolian grill is okay.  You put together a variety of vegetables and pick your meat of your choice for the chef to grill up.  They're heavy handed on the oil and soy sauce, so I suggest you put your own sauce.  They are busy and rush through the process, so this is not always the best option.  My dish was overly salty and and I'm sorry that I had to waste good shrimp.  The dessert section carried a variety of carrot cake, pecan pie, peach cobblers and my ultimate favorite, anything chocolate cake.",

We mostly only go on Sundays for Brunch but the normal buffet runs around $10 for breakfast and lunch, $15-25 for dinner (depending on if it's a specialty night) and brunch runs $15.99 on Sundays. These prices are for if you have a players card and if you don't it's easy to get one, plus I recommend getting one anyways, because every month they will send you free $ to use at any of their eateries or buy 1 get 1 free buffets on top of the already great prices.  Now for brunch you also get unlimited champagne and/or mimosas for that $15.99 price. They also have all the breakfast items with an egg/omelete station, meat carving station with all the meats, international stations, a mongolian bbq station where you can get custom bowls made (also you can just get plates of shortribs cooked up for you - yum!), the salad bar and a fun dessert section (you can get mock coldstone ice cream).  The line will get long so I recommend coming at noon or before :)",

I tried many different pies, and they were not very good. Some pies lacked enough filling, where it was difficult to tell exactly what I was eating (it was basically just whipped cream on top of pie crust)...and even the pies that did have the proper enough filling, the flavor was not very satisfying. Also, the ice cream (which was ok), was ruined because the whipped cream on top was warm. But inspite of the lousy desserts, all the entree's and appetizers were very good, so this place still deserves a 4 star rating.",

The employees are simply rude and have no urgency in attending to customers' needs or even show the slightest sign of making sure their customers are taken care of. The ambiance is gloomy, dark and super crowded. It's as if they are too busy that they cramp as many tables in as possible and the employees can't keep up with the demand. We drove to this location from summerlin bc a year ago we went and actually enjoyed it very much and this time we had guests from our of town, and felt embarrassed at what we encountered. Our guests were definitely not impressed either. It's unfortunate that they have declined in so many ways. We won't be going back any time soon and definitely do not recommend it to you.

    "text": "Came for weekday lunch. I believe this Feast is the most expensive of all the Station Casinos. Of course you can save a few bucks with the Station casino card. Unfortunately, I didn't have B1G1 and kids are still full price.  There are two lines and when you miss the cutoff at 10:45, you'll be charged for lunch. Even when their register system are down to check for points, the line just comes to a complete halt.   Where we sat was just strange. What I mean by that is, first we were as far away from the buffet as possible. (Which was fine). However, the layout of the tables were one way on one side, and opposite the next row. So when you have to carry your plate of food, you have to navigate left, and then right, and repeat.   The orange juice here taste awful, but the cranberry juice is excellent. The coffee was awful as well, it tasted burnt.   My favorite stations here was the Chinese food section. The stir fried boy choy was excellent, and the char siu was above average.   As for fruit, there were only watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe, and it was not good. All the salads were always half full at most and always running out.   The carving station had chicken that wasn't cook through.   So I just went to dessert and the chocolate cream pie tasted doughy and no sign of sweetness.   Our waitress was great in the beginning and disappeared for a long time. But then again, I did see she had at least 10 tables.   Quite honestly, go to the Red Rock Station Casino, it's a LOT better.",

The food taste and variety are below average when compared to the Indian casinos.  We went here on a Saturday (labor day weekend) after reading some of the Yelp reviews. I was very very disappointed over the food quality and variety. The only good thing I can say is, their small selection of desserts were tastier than their other foods. Also, our server Emmanuel was very prompt and attentive, for which we tipped him generously.",

I did like the omlette station and was able to veggies and cheese and that was pretty tasty. The other good thing is that they started putting out lunch right before we left so they had a little better selection.  The food is too bland.  Also I have a 2 year old and 4 year old and they had to pay full price.  They can't eat as much as an adult, lol. I am guessing that they do this so you won't bring kids.  They get one star for the food, but their service was good. The waiter was super nice and attentive.  Hopefully they will make the some changes to their selections.",

This is the worst of all of the Feast Buffets, and we have tried them all.   1. Entry logistics are terrible. Long line, no rhyme or reason to the flow of people, or seating protocols.   2. Food is sub par, for the price. Comparable buffets have considerably better food options and quality.   3. If you have kids, please don't bother. Local or otherwise, skip this place. $14.99 for a 2 year old at breakfast, and they can't seem to figure out how or where to place a family requiring one or several highchairs. Just plain ignorant to the needs of their patrons. Expect no less than a 15 minute ADDITIONAL wait if you need more than one highchair.   4. Hand me a pen that works when you want me to sign a credit card receipt. If your sales counter does not work with the pen that you handed me, get a different pen or counter or whatever...I am being picky here, but please, don't make it annoying or difficult for people to give you thier hard earned money. You are part of a very successful casino chain, you should know how to be efficient at taking people's money by now.   We live in one of the service capitals of the US, and we are accostomed to \"service with an smile\", and pay/tip well for these services. If you decide to eat at this buffet, expect NO service, with a blank stare.   To reiterate, this buffet is complete garbage in all aspects. Pay a little more and go elsewhere, or don't eat at all. You will add years to your life by not consuming this trash, and avoiding the aggravation.",

The atmosphere was fine as the whole casino is clean and styled pretty nicely, but the food was hit or miss on taste and quality.  There were only a couple of items from each section that were good but nothing outstanding and I was very hungry upon arrival.  For half the price it may be OK.  I have had much better at a lower price.  The prime rib was mostly unchewable sinew ridden fat so I switched to turkey which was decent. I tried a made to order milk shake and even that was so-so.  The salad bar had mostly tired looking offerings but the seasoned olives were addictive. It looks like based upon the recent reviews that the quality has slipped and from my first time there the amount and types of offerings are dismal. I have even tried Circus Circus a couple of years ago and it rivals or exceeds this -- and that is Circus Circus I am talking about!",

    "text": "I had not been there in over ten years and had a great meal last time. Sadly things are much different now. The price for a weekday dinner was over $8 with a 50% off coupon and it still was not worth it. First I tried the Orange Chicken. The chicken was cooked properly but the flavor is the cheap Orange flavor like what you get with the generic frozen version of Orange Chicken. Next I tried the pasta noodles. They too were cooked fine but the Alfredo sauce was as bland as water. The bread sticks were hard as a rock.  New batch came out later and they were also hard as a rock. The pizza looked good but after I took a bite, all I could taste is salt. I like salt but heavy salt use in pizza sauce just ruins it. I then went to try the tacos. Flour tortillas were soft and the cheese and other condiments were fresh.  Not sure how the ground beef was made other than relying on a lot peppers both red and green. Flavor again was lacking. Dessert was a chocolate fudge cake. Sadly fudge type is all the rage these days and it is hard to find a regular good old Chocolate cake. The icing on these things is not just on top but at two layers before you get to the bottom. Way too sugary for most folks. The Chocolate Chip cookies were decent and soft. I would not recommend this buffet to anyone. Go to the food court they have there to get some flavor for your $8. Just throw the coupon away and eat elsewhere.  The seating was also close and cramped so getting back and forth with your food  often meant getting cozy to someone eating at another table in order for someone to pass the other direction. Pretty place but what a shame the quality of the food is nowhere near what it used to be many years ago.",

We remember when they has King Crab legs everyday, and not just on friday. Overall Good variety yes, but so many items that you should not even try to sample, tonight it is the purple cabbage, not over cooked; it was bordering on spoiled! The Chinese section was once a delight and truly a Chinese Dynasty Grill, now it's mostly a nasty grill. The items are surely carried over from lunch and most likely the lunch items were carried over from the previous night's dinner. It needs to be rotated out when it gets soggy and old, don't just cook more and pile it up on top. Tonight the prime rib is tender, but flavorless and the guy carving is burnt out at his work and not even friendly. Ahh, the fried shrimp....some overcooked and dark brown and some under cooked and soggy. Hey here they go again, a new batch is just dumped on top of the old batch. Service is good and fairly attentive, good refills and  a bit slow at clearing the used plates. If you eat here, be selective and choose the standard choices. Don't over do it and go for seconds, it probably won't be as good the second time around. Take my word for it this isn't a good buffet and as far as the Stations casino buffets go, the Red Rock is probably the best. I am sure they have about the  same supply of food items to choose from, but they do something better up on the other side of town.  Too bad all the \"Beast\" buffets couldn't follow suit. C-",

    "text": "I believe tonight will be my family's last visit to this buffet.  With 2 kids under 5, this place has become UN-kid friendly. As of June 17th 2012 kids under 2 are free. So we basically have to pay $12.99 for my 3 year old son to eat. Screw that!! When my husband and I only pay $13.99 with a players card why the hell would I pay $12.99 for my 3 year old to drink apple juice and eat greasy macaroni with a few pieces of fruit?!  Whoever made this change in their pricing must be out of their mind. Nice way to lose customers.    Another annoying thing is how slow the line moves. After you've paid you have to wait to be seated. If its taking a while to seat people then that means those who have paid are still standing right in front of the cash register cause there is nowhere for them to go. So the cashier just stands there and waits until they are out of the way to ring up the next person. All this goes on while the cashier at the \"VIP\" register stands there and chit chats because he has no body in his line. One would think he'd ring up the next person from the normal people line, but no he doesn't. Us normal folks must not be good enough for that.   By the time you get seated you are so annoyed!  Now I'll get to the food. It's ok. Your standard buffet food.  It's the Feast so you have Asian, Mexican, Italian, American, a carving station, salad bar, Mongolian grill, and desserts.  I'm pretty sure I didn't miss anything. Oh, we visited in a Friday night at 5:30. There was about 10 people ahead of us and it took 20 minutes just to pay. We didn't have to wait to be seated cause our party was already inside.   There is nothing special about this buffet. I wouldn't be sad if I never went there again.",

This time around I opted to have my crab legs & shrimp tossed on the griddle and the cook saute'd them in butter, garlic, cilantro, green onions & chili paste (tell them how spicy you want it). Frickin' delicious...check out the pics I uploaded. I even asked the carver to throw my slice on the grill...another good choice! It's off of the strip, so that might make sense of how cheap it is ($16.99 for dinner vs. $25+ at most other dinner buffets)   ***Oh and for the people that used to pay for the crab legs $5 / lb. NO MORE!!! That's right, They no longer charge for crab legs!!!***",

Both were good-not spectacular, mind you, but good. The waitstaff and servers are excellent. I had carved beef. Others have said that it was great. They were right. Then, I had grilled sausage with onions and bell peppers. It also was pretty good. I would have grilled the peppers a little more but I happily ate them.  Dessert was ok but I have always been disappointed by buffet desserts; and that includes the Bellagio and The M, The Rio---all of them. They look great but only taste ok. Ok means so-so and don't waste your time with them.  All-in-all, I liked the experience and will come back. Of course, that's because that's how I am. Not changing either. Just give me some wonderful CHERRY pie and I will fade away in happy contentment.",

The good thing about this was they charge less about $12 per person. The quality is pretty good too. Everthing I ate on the the Chinese station was tasty and fresh.   The menudo soup was very good , better then most Mexican restaurants in town, for some reason I always have to season my menudo soup at Mexican restaurants not here. The prime rib was good quality not like some other buffets where they went too a cheaper off tasting product. I can't explain it , but I know it when I taste it.               I saved the best for last, the bread pudding is one of the best or the best I ever had.  When they first opened I fell in love w/ this bread pudding, There was a time I would crave it .  It is crusty on top and very moist at the bottom, it is very custard like , they also have a creme anglais( thin vanilla custard sauce) that u can put on it to make it even better.

Just get your fill of crab legs--cold, steamed, or custom sauteed to your level of spiciness. If you do the latter, the cooks toss your portion of crab legs in a very flavorful sauce of fresh chopped tomatoes, green onions, parsley, and I think chili oil. The combination may not sound right but it's good! Just about every table around us had a plateful.   Also complimentary wine in one corner.",
