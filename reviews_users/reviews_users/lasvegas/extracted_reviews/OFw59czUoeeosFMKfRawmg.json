Some people hate page long menus like this one or the Cheesecake Factory. Not me, I LOVE choices. Although that usually means ordering more than I need or can intake but I am totally ok with that!  Between the options of soup, salad, steak, seafood, pasta, and even the occasional  Hispanic or Asian flare- you can pretty much please everyone. I am not saying every single dish is off the charts, but I haven't had anything I wouldn't order again.  A couple favorites are the Pecan Crusted chicken, Cajun fish tacos, the plain ol house salad (with extra dressing), salmon, and a friend of mine swears by the Cajun pasta, but I have yet to try it. Another plus- convenience!!! I can come here to sit at the bar, have a family dinner, or be in and out within my hour lunch break. Truly a great location in the central business are of Vegas.  Overall, there are FEW chains I would ever recommend, and this will always be one of them!",

The other waiter sat \"waiting\" for customers, during the 2 hours I was there he got no customers...go figure! The appetizers during a Happy Hour are $8.99 for 3 small tacos, for 1 example. Great tasting but Happy Hour is for lowered prices. I had a 16 oz. Wit, good tasting but again during Happy Hour a 16 oz. could have been a bit better in price. I know now why the other 2 locations are permanently closed. Never go here again when there are so many other brewery Happy Hour restaurants in this great town.",

They have a great selection of beer, wine, and appetizers 2.99-5.99!   The bar area is comfortable and fun. It was rather busy and loud tonight because of the NFL draft going on. The bar has four large TV screens and a large wooden bar. There are also high top tables with benches also available for larger parties.   The food menu for happy hour includes sliders, garlic fries, sushi, flatbread, pizza, and wings. A little bit of everything for anyone.   Our waitress was friendly and timely for how busy she was . Our drinks were always full. She came to check on us numerous times.  The food and drinks were amazing. I enjoyed this much needed relaxation and indulgence !",

She comes back with a half-full drink to replace the one that was taken.  We thought this was a bit odd, we figured she would bring us a 'full' drink, since it was taken from us in error.  The server gets the manager (Julie?) who was adamant about not replacing it with a whole drink, because the drink that was taken was only half full.  Are we really arguing about this?!?  She finally says 'Fine, I'll just get you another drink' with a noticeable undertone of attitude.  And we ended up getting charged for both drinks.  Come on.....  This could have been handled much better from the get-go; I feel the manager cared more about saving the dollar in liquor cost than just taking care of the issue.

I also ordered the NY strip steak with veggies and ordered it medium rare but of course it came out medium-medium well.  I was a little disappointed in that but ate it anyway. The flavor was good but a little tough since it was over cooked. Also ordered the gorgonzola pear salad and a beer.  That all came out to about $50.  Not overly priced at all!  Not  a place I would frequent in Vegas,  but it wasn't too bad!",

I always visit when I am at the LVCC for a show, but lately it has become a regular happy hour place.  They brew their own beer, several types, there is something for everyone.  I prefer the Marzen, they also have excellent seasonals.  The food menu is updated regularly with a nice mix of appetizers and entrees.",

So we stumbled across Gordon Biersch on a Sunday afternoon needing something to eat and a little football would not hurt either.  We got there in time for their happy hour that starts at three.  It consisted of discounted drinks and a special happy hour menu.  We ordered a salad and fish and chips.  They would not give us potato chips in exchange for fries so we also ordered potato chips topped with chunks of bleu cheese.  Everything was good including the beer of course.  My girl friend really liked the fried fish.  Had a great time eating drinking and watching football.  Would definitely go back.",

A lot of people are comparing this place to BJ's in Southern California but what they're forgetting is that the food at BJ's is barely one step above dog food!! It's pretty foul. In comparison, Gordon Biersch is a freakin' five-star restaurant.  The quality of the food was great, the prices were reasonable, the garlic fries were yummy, and I wish the only location of GB that we had in SoCal hadn't gone out of business a couple years ago!!  I would recommend checking this place out for dinner instead of lunch-- a lot of their entrees sounded really good, but even in Vegas I had a hard time letting myself order a $18 plate of pasta for lunch! The sandwiches were amazing too, though.",

Unpleasantly suprised to find a bus arrive shortly after we did with a group of 20-30 go into the building.  Hence when we finally got our seats (maybe 20-30 minutes later), it was a LONG wait for the food to arrive.  The food was decent but not spectacular.  Considering the other choices available in the immediate area and the cost involved, I would be hesitant to return unless invited.  The beer is excellent here so come for that, not the food (except for the Garlic Fries!).  Go to Hard Rock, Firefly, Bahama Breeze or Ellis Island...all are within 5 minutes of here and are either better in food or cheaper (such as Ellis Island which has it's own beer, too, and the $7 dinner nightly).",

Amstel Light tastes better than all of them, I don't know, maybe I'm spoiled having acquired my taste for beer while living in Belgium.

The pizza is no longer a pizza but a \"flatbread\" that tasted like a saltine cracker and while the flavor of the pizza wasn't that bad it left me still super hungry after eating half of it. I ordered homemade potato chips \"smothered\" in creamy caramelized onion cheese sauce with sweet & spicy caramelized onions. topped with fresh green onions and crumbled feta cheese. I ended up with a plate of homemade potato chips with a few sprinklings of green onions and feta and a huge pile of onions, was there a sauce on it? I couldn't tell. The best thing I tried was an individual beef tenderloin slider, it came with 4, yes 4, potato chips and a slider for $5.95. The tenderloin was so tender and had great flavor but the buttery bun wasn't buttery and you really couldn't tell there was bacon, carmelized onions or cheese on it. Our server was good enough and I wouldn't penalize her because the restaurant she works for has gone downhill. Even for happy hour I won't go back. I left still hungry after spending $25 on three small plates items that just weren't worth it and went to my local bar for a real margherita pizza for only $5",

    "text": "Even though I've walked or drove past several Gordon Biersch locations in the Bay Area over the years, I've never been to one before. I prefer my breweries independent, as well as separated from restaurants.  I was staying nearby and figured it was worth checking out, rather than making the trek towards the strip. I'm glad I put my biases towards macro beer aside, because I actually enjoyed my short visit to this brewery that just so happens to serve food.  The beer here appears to be brewed on site by brewmaster Julio Lanzas. That alone is rare for a restaurant brewery chain. It shows in the final product. They have a few beers that you won't find bottled in your local supermarket.  The Session IPA was surprisingly hoppy and not exactly what most people think of as a sessionable beer at over 5% ABV. Who knew a German brewery could brew such a decent West Coast style beer. No it's not fantastic but for the price and location, there's not much better fresh from the tap.  The IPA was a bit of a miss. It's a bit less balanced than the Session. I didn't taste much hops on this one. It was what I would expect from GB. Especially after trying the smooth hoppy Session immediately before it.     The Stout was a thick, delicious, slightly stronger version of an Irish Stout. A mix of Imperial and Irish perhaps?   I was pleasantly surprised with their Belgian Tripel. I'm not normally a fan of the Belgian stuff but this was an incredibly well done take on this style. Kudos to the brewmaster on this one.   I like how they have several different size glasses to choose from at reasonable price differences. I rolled with the pint size since I wanted to try several different beers during one visit, but you can go all the the way up to 23.some odd ounce glass if you're feelin' randy.   The service was great. The bald bartender was on top of it with me and all the other customers at the bar. He is definitely an asset to this business.    Actually after visiting the strip, I appreciate this place that much more. It's not overpriced, the beer is decent, with a variety of styles and great customer service. Other brewpubs could use a lesson from this place.",

My steak arrived with a side of cold mashed potatoes and green beans. When I told the waiter, he didn't even stand around long enough, he just told the runner to bring another hot side of beans (I had to eat cold mashed potatoes). They brought another dish of green beans but replced it with my wife's side of green beans; he took her side plate away (she was still eating her order of green beans). I asked for my steak to be medium and it was still raw in the middle.  When the meal came to an end and we asked for dessert, the waiter said they did not have any coffee and we would have to wait 10 minutes. We passed on the dessert and asked for the bill. All in all, it was not a very pleasant experience and we will not be returning.",

    "text": "I've been to Gordon Biersch several times over the last 8-10 years and my experiences have been good, but not entirely consistent. Our recent visit was prompted by a group dinner with co-workers, so we were situated in one of their private dining rooms and a set menu. The group ordered a couple extra appetizers as well.  Bruschetta: Served with toasted crostini. This didn't seem particularly fresh and was so overpowered by garlic. I really do love garlic, but that was basically all you could taste. The crostini was rubbed with garlic and grilled, so they were really nice by itself, but too much with the bruschetta.  Fried Calamari: Served with marinara and spicy lemon remoulade. The calamari was okay; tasty, but not tender and too little squid to batter ratio. Enjoyed the marinara.  Crispy Crab Risotto Fritters: Crab, pancetta and havarti in creamy risotto, served over spicy lemon remoulade. Good fritters and the spicy lemon remoulade worked much better with this appetizer.  Southwest Egg Rolls: Stuffed with pulled chicken, black beans, corn, roasted red peppers, carrots, zucchini and pepper jack cheese. Delicious! Flavorful, crispy exterior, and great dipping sauce.  Classic Caesar Salad: Your usual suspects. Decent salad.  Smoked Chicken and Mushroom Pasta: Chicken, tomato, mushroom, herbs, beer-infused gorgonzola cream sauce, bowtie pasta. Another shrug. The beer-infused gorgonzola cream gets an 'A' for effort.  Steak Frites: 7 oz Cab top sirloin with Gorgonzola Garlic sauce and Legendary Garlic Fries. The steak was delicious and cooked perfectly medium rare. I really liked the gorgonzola garlic sauce! The garlic fries were really awesome this time. (I've had really bad ones in the past)  Triple Chocolate Brownie: Caramel and chocolate sauces. Lacked the moisture and tenderness of a really good brownie, but still good.  Across the board, food is just okay with nothing remotely special. I would say that it was a decent spot for beer and eats, but there are so many new spots in Vegas that serve up great beers and equally amazing food. I would return for Garlic Fries only.",

    "text": "We dined here this evening and I had such high hopes for this place, mostly because I've been to the location at Boca Park and the service and food is always great.  Being restaurant managers and coming from food service backgrounds ourselves my boyfriend and I tend to take it easy on our fellow comrades, but this was a little crazy. The only reason we are giving one star is because we could tell most of the issues might have been resolved if the poor waitress didn't have so many tables in her section.  To begin our party was a surprise dinner planned by myself and a friend for her husband. Everyone was to arrive by 6:45 and the birthday boy was to arrive promptly at 7pm. At 6:53pm the hostess came over to our table where 95% of us had already arrived and had our drink order taken and told us that there was a miscommunication and that that table was for another party arriving shortly. According to her our table was ready outside. I asked her if we could make the switch RIGHT AWAY that we would go. She assures me it is, walks out to the patio (maybe unaware I was following her) and proceeds to look bewildered at the scattered empty tables and heaters. Long story short, the guys in our party rushed to put this table together, our table had 2 heaters for 15 of us, we did not receive menus/share plates/silverware for quite sometime, and our server took even longer to take our food order.   IMPORTANT NOTE: I was not going to write a YELP about this experienced as I noticed all the tables the server had inside (and, again, I tend to take it easy on industry in situations like this), but the kicker came when I politely pulled the manager aside to give him a friendly heads up about the situation and he took zero blame and made no apologies. According to him it was entirely the servers responsibility to ask for help and as far as he was concerned all the tables he saw of hers were doing good (although he mentioned the only table he didn't know about, conveniently, was ours). Interesting to know given that I walked to the restroom and host stand several times for separate reasons, keeping my eyes peeled for a manager that was never there. In my professional opinion it is NEVER OK to make excuses to your guest and blame your staff. Was this guy serious? My intention was to give him a friendly heads up as a fellow restaurant manager and instead I left feeling more disappointed and a little bit disgusted.  My hope is that this particular manager reads this YELP and realizes the effect of his words and demeanor. Customer service rule #1 : The guest is always right. (even when they're not) and in this case we definitely were. Not sure I care to give this place another try in the near future. Hope this helps GM (I'm assuming this manager was not the GM).",

I don't mean speed alone - I realize I visited on a Friday night and that it would be busy. But the staff was impersonal, uninterested, and acted as if they were getting paid $30/hr. no matter how they treated us.   The food, though I don't know how, didn't even compare to the other location. The signature garlic fries were soggy, rather than crisp, and the fresh parsley that usually tops the lot had apparently wilted under a heat lamp. Fresh chopped garlic was seemingly an afterthought (on GARLIC fries?), as it was unsoftened and spicy.  The turkey burger looked, tasted, and felt like leftover meatloaf. Not leftover from last night, but maybe last week. The fresh avocado was the only saving grace, though the steamed veggies on the side weren't hurting anything.  I don't usually give restaurants too hard of a time on the weekends, but the combined service, flavor (or lack of both) was offensive.",

Went here in Valentine's because we were staying across the street and didn't wanna go into the strip. We also got a coupon from the front counter at the La Quinta across the street which was nice. The service started out like crap and picked up toward the end. I got the marzen bbq burger. It was like 13 bucks so I had high expectations. My burger was ordered medium and came out WELL done and NOT hot. In fact NONE of our food was hot! I subbed the fries for asparagus because we got the garlic fries for an appetizer. The fries tasted good, but weren't hot. The asparagus was cooked well with a good char but no spice at all. And again came out barely warm. My wife got a salad and it was okay, but the greens didn't taste fresh to me. I told my server about the burger which I could barely eat half of because it was so over cooked and he offered free dessert. I kinda just wanted it taken off but I was still hungry so I settled for the triple brownie with ice cream. The dessert looked good, but again, it came out barely warm expect the very middle, I'm pretty sure they microwave it for 30 seconds and bring it out. It was a little bitter for my taste. I prefer a decadent brownie and maybe a little more moist. It was rather dry considering it's price. I got it for free so I can't complain too much, but it was only free because they messed up the burger too. I have never had a bad experience at GB in Az, but this one is not good!!! There are about a thousand better choices in Vegas, don't waste your time here.",

After spending a good amount they a party next to us who proceeded to light up a smelly cigar and was blowing it i our faces. In disgust we moved all the way to the other side of the patio to escape but the smell followed us. The management agreed it was disgusting and yet did nothing about it. Any decent restaurant would have a no cigar policy out of respect for the other patrons. We will take our considerable Hilton business with us elsewhere from now on.",

I came in here on a Sunday around after studying at the library with two of my friends. As soon as we walked in the hostess seemed annoyed that she actually had to do some work. We finally got seated and our server came up and read off a prepared statement he had written down on his bad to talk about his beers. He took everyone order and never came back with our drinks =(.   The really crappy thing is the fact that the food took forrrrever to come out. And we weren't the only ones. The manager just loved walking around doing absolutely nothing. I mean everyone in our section was sitting there for at least 30min+ with out any food and he just frolicked around the restaurant with a smile on his face like this is how it supposed to be.  I hate the Kobe burger which was pretty whatever, just like an over-priced patty that people think is really high-end, but the garlic fries were pretty good. My friend had a lobster tacos which came with a cold side of rice/beans and for $15 he expected at least 3, not 2 tacos. Sucks for him.   I've been here before for HH and its always been pretty good but i dunno wtf happened this time. Whatevers, ill check it out again for HH, but man that was a horrrrrible experiece",

The restaurant is big and roomy, the ceiling is high like a cathedral and the giant windows makes the environment look bright and comfortable. The service was exceptional and there was never a moment we had to ask for a refill, even with +15 people.  I had the salmon dish as well as the steak tacos. The steak is so tender it almost tastes like the salmon in terms of texture and consistency. Their garlic fries are amazing. The home-made root beer is excellent, if you're a root beer fan. If you want to try something exciting, I recommend the lobster tacos or the crab cakes. Despite whatever you order, everyone's feedback in the group seemed positive. Whether it was the BBQ hamburger, pasta, tacos or salmon, it was well enjoyed.  I'm not sure if I would go here for sports events simply because there isn't enough TVs. In the corner I was sitting, the closest TV to me was about 6 yards away near the bar. So it's definitely not like The Boiling Crab or even Yardhouse in that regard. However, the Happy Hour should make it all worthwhile. I'm hoping to check out the HH the next time around.",

Second I would like to stand up for the spectacular bartenders and waiters/waitresses, as I have seen many reviews that state there is bad service.  I will be honest sometimes I do not sit at the bar and sit at a table top in the bar area and once in a great while I may get someone who is not the best, however, if you sit at the bar, will you get great service.  My favorite bartender is Matt.  He is extremely friendly and is very attentive.  I also used to go more often during the day for lunch.  Forgive me for not remembering her name, there is a wonderful bartender there during lunch, she has short hair.  I feel bad because no matter how long it has been since I have been there she has always remembered me.  The food I love, the drinks are even better and I am not a beer drinker.  As long as I am being totally honest, I agree with Vincent K and his review of the manger.",

    "text": "Met the gf here for a light meal right after work on on Tuesday (last night). We sat in the high tables in the bar area during happy hour.  Staff: Waitress was nice, smiling and polite. She went along with some of the witty banter me and the lady were spewing. She was prompt and checked on us often, refiling the free bevs each pass.   Food: OK so maybe I am an Italian from NY and I have high expectations for pizza, however they did have a Margarita flat bread on the happy hour menu and figured it was worth on try. Turns out I should have held out for elsewhere. The 'flatbread' was more of a crispy communion wafer then actual bread. The ingredients on the top did not do it any justice either. We each got the harvest chicken salad (not be design, i was hoping to critique 2 dishes but it was exactly what I was craving (salad with chicken, pecans, raisins, apples, etc). It was actually a sizable portion and I ended taking some home. It was good, but not great. The dressing was lackluster, but the chicken was really good. Felt like maybe I should have found a chicken dish on its own and tried that  Ambiance: Actually has a good feel to it. Plenty of light and space - doesn't feel like you are in a hole of a bar like some of these places. Wasn't too busy (Tuesday early evening). But the bar was full by the time we left around 730  Happy hours - looks like a pretty decent deal, some cheap food, however I cant comment on quality as I only had the flatbread (see above food). Tuesdays they have $2.50 beers, just not specialty/bottled, so no cider for me ($5)  Overall - I like the feel in there, just wasn't big on the food. But the staff was nice and I feel like I will probably give it another go and try something else on the menu",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had our birthday dinner here during their late night happy hour. We had a group of about 20 people that were all seated within the same corner of the bar area. We were stressing out beforehand because we knew it was first come first serve and we were expecting close to 30 people that would all show up at different times. Luckily the bar area wasn't very busy that night, so we were all able to sit in the same area.   Me and my bf ordered our food and drinks once we got there and closed our bill immediately because we didn't want to go thru the whole craziness of huge group bill. Good thing we did that, because when more people started arriving, the waitress told them all that she couldn't split any bills because \"it would just be too hard.\"   I shared the calamari ($7) and slider combo ($11) with my boyfriend. We substituted the pulled pork sliders for kobe since my bf said the pulled pork was too oily and saucy last time he came, so we got garlic fries and 6 kobe sliders. I only had a couple pieces of fries. They were pretty good and very garlicky, but I didn't want dragon breath as I was hosting the dinner. The sliders were mediocre, nothing special. I ate about two and got bored. The calamari was good. I always like it when my calamari comes with marinara. I wish the menu would've mentioned  the other sauce having horse radish though. I hate horseradish!  A couple of my friends ordered me drinks. I was given a raspberry ice pick, which was nice and refreshing and a Long Island Iced Tea, which I only drank about a fourth of and gave the rest to my brother because I felt like it was going to make me pass out on the floor.    All in all, mediocre food (at least during happy hour), mediocre service, good drinks, and a good place for groups. 3 stars for you!",

    "text": "Just want to qualify my review before I get into it.  1) I don't really drink, so the extensive fine beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages was not a big draw for me. 2) I was there for a coworker's birthday dinner and we had a large group.  I arrived on time at Gordon Biersch, and there was only 1 couple that was there on time waiting for the rest of the group to show. I spoke to the hostesses and they were very friendly.  The restaurant wasn't very crowded at all for a Friday evening at 7pm. And they have already setup the table for our large party.   After debating what to order, I opted for the House Special Gorgonzola Bone-In Ribeye Steak. It is an 18 oz steak topped with Gorgonzola butter, served with garlic mashed potatoes and vegetables for $27.95.  When it was served, the steak was definitely huge and cooked to my desired doneness of medium rare. But the flavor of the steak was totally underwhelming, and I question if they even used at least USDA Choice grade steak.  Pretty disappointing, considering that I can grill a mean steak at home or in the culinary school's kitchen.   A friend ordered a Vegetarian Pizza.  That looks good and although they were not hungry, they still managed to finished all of it.  Definitely a better sign.   Anyway, service was okay.  Our waitress kept coming back to ask if we were ready to order, but since not everyone has arrived we decided to wait and she had to come back several times.  So A+ for the patience in dealing with a large party and the indecision when it comes time to order.  But she lost some points for neglecting to mention that an additional 18% is automatically added to the amount charged when the credit card is swiped.  Even if the amount charged already factored in the mandatory 18% tip.  So had we not caught the billing irregularity, the waitress would have made way more than 18%.  So D- for that.   Also the water served didn't taste that good. I am sure they use some sort of water filtration system, but the Las Vegas water still won and what we were served tasted more like common tap water from Lake Mead. A lemon wedge would have helped masked the taste, but none were offered.   Overall, I would only give this Gordon Biersch a 2 star rating.  Food was just not that good. I am sure the beer is at least decent and at $5 per glass, that seems like a good price.  But food really was a major let down. The chicken wings were way too sweet. Bone-In Ribeye, which is one of the most expensive menu item, but had a Denny's taste.    I definitely would not recommend anyone to come here for the food alone.  If you need a place to hang out and get some beer and relax and watch ESPN, I guess you could come here, but there are way more better options around town.",

    "text": "A large group of us decided to go out here tonight.  As another reviewer stated, the garlic fries smelled amazing (Although I didn't have any) walking through the restaurant.  We debated on sitting inside or outside and chose outside since the weather was nice.  When we got out there they had the misters running which normally would be a good idea I'm sure since it's the middle of the desert, but it was totally unnecessary tonight.  Of the 8 adult males at our table all 8 were nearly shivering, shirts, table, menus, appetizers, etc were all wet too.  We asked the waitress to see if they could turn it down or off, didn't hear anything back, asked again about 20 minutes later and the response was that she could go ask the manager if we wanted her to but that would mean that she was going to sweat her ass off for 8 hours (Direct quote)...which tells me that she completely blew us off the first time.  So I did notice that our table was up on an elevated part of the patio which places us closer to the misters.  Pretty bad design, it may be worth looking into nozzles with a different flow rate or just capping off every other one on that level of the patio.  Additionally, the restaurant was just not that busy and our food still came out piecemeal, with one in our party waiting an extra 10 minutes for his food, and everything was just slow.  Experience aside, I ordered the seafood stew and it was great.  All sorts of seafood but not an overwhelming fishy flavor.  There was enough but it was balanced and the real unique thing was the fennel.  I've never had fennel in a seafood soup before and it was perfect, I think it offset the fishiness enough to keep it from being one dimensional.",

    "text": "its a typical 3.5-star restaurant. Nothing special - even their famous beer is not that great anymore.   It doesnt mean their quality has fallen - today, we have a lot of restaurants/bar serving all kinds of beer from around the world. This makes G&B not so special anymore (it was 10 years ago).  However, if you like watching basketball and football games, this is a place to go. They even have happy hours - you get $1 discount on all beers! Only a dollar but it counts.   Other happy hour meals were like 5, 6, 7 dollars and they seem to be ok. I didnt order any of them - I dont order food based on the price. You live only once. Eat what you wanna eat. Then maybe you will get heart attack and die happily. Yes, food here is very greasy.",

    "text": "Reserved an area for a coworkers retirement party and they provided us 4 counter height tables with ten chairs. We previously told them we expected 40-50 people. Needless to say, we ended up having about 30 people standing up the entire time. We all wanted to order food, but without sufficient tables, there was nowhere for us to actually eat the food.   We asked if we could get additional tables or be seated elsewhere, and they said NO because the tables were for customers. (?!?) the restaurant was about 80-90% empty at this point.   We tried to sit at the nearly empty bar, but the shoo'd us away because they said they were expecting customers. I'm not sure what they thought we were, but we were a group of 40-50 teachers (who made reservations) at the end of the school year. If anyone is going to order a ton of drinks, it is a group of teachers at the end of the school year.   From the moment we walked in, they constantly told us we weren't customers, even though we had called weeks ahead and reserved an area. We had all planned on drinking and ordering a lot of food. They didn't want to serve us and made it very clear.   Our server was hostile. When I spoke to the manager, she said, \"what do you want me to do about it? The seating areas are for customers.\" Also, the manager told us we couldn't stand near the tables because of fire code. Have I mentioned that the restaurant was 80% empty and they refused to seat us or allow to sit at the bar? They basically gave us a 10x10 area to stand in.   The bottom line is that this restaurant basically refused to serve a group of 50 teachers who had made a reservation for a party.",

Everything else was failure from the service, to the portions, to the menu that can't decide if it's pub food, or burgers, or a Tapas place, they should have just stuck to pub grub. First the appetizers were the smallest undersized portions I have ever seen.  Buffalo wings which were tasty but you got like 5.  Not enough toast points for the crab dip, and the mussels were a joke, literally only 6 were served and 2 didn't even open, plus they were under seasoned.  The bratwurst appetizer needed triple more bratwurst with a beer cheese infused dipping sauce instead or marzen mustard.  The pretzel it came with was very good, and the garlic fries were decent also.  So food was overpriced and undersized and the waiter was a ghost.  Worst brewery pub I have ever been too.",

    "text": "Gordon Biersch has some good things about this place, but overall, it's just meh.   Let start off with the good:  SERVICE: 5/5 The service was amazing. Our server was friendly and attentive, and checked up on us several times during our meal to make sure we had everything.  ATMOSPHERE: 5/5 The place is really nice, well-decorated, and clean. We came here when it opened at 11:00 am, but it quickly filled up with convention goers and business people close to the area. Despite this, I really enjoyed the casual vibe.  FOOD: 3/5 We ordered an artichoke and crab dip for starter. It was waaaayyy too cheesy (and I am not one to shy away from cheese). It was 90% cream cheese and 10% artichoke and crab. It was really disappointing, because we could hardly taste the artichoke and crab. They also didn't give us enough chips/bread, but we didn't want to finish it anyways.  My boyfriend had the Kobe cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. He said it was good, cooked well, but had a salty aftertaste. The sweet potato fries with ranch were yummy though.  I got the house made fish tacos with garlic fries. The tacos were meh. They were edible and okay, but definitely not memorable. The garlic fries were good, but so are the fries at McDonalds.   PRICING: 2/5 For the starter and two entrees, our meal was about $45. Definitely not worth it.   OVERALL: 3/5  Overall, I wouldn't come back unless it was to try the beer. There's a lot more places with the same pricing that offer better food.",

The location is perfect for north strip employees to grab a bite off strip and for off site meetings with it being very accessible from the airport. Though I do enjoy this restaurant for convenience, they are not amazing at keeping your drink full and the front host area is often congested with employees not providing service.   Hour Hour - They have a menu for happy hour that includes drink specials for each day of the week such as $5 Martinis or vodka specials. They also have a food menu with appetizers like their garlic fries, seared ahi tuna, fish tacos and flat breads ranging anywhere from $4-$7. There are plenty of TVs to catch games however I've not witnessed volume for them. Happy hour is daily from 3pm-6:30pm and all day on Saturdays! They also offer it again for the late hours of 10pm - close. *only available in bar area (bar, booths, and high tops included)  Lunch - They do not offer a lunch special or half portions during lunch but it is a great place for business lunches. During the lunch hour it is mostly workplace professionals throughout the dinning and bar area.   Dinner - Full menu offered including drinks. Reservations are not required nor usually needed. They can easily accommodate small and large groups.   Group & Private Events - I've utilized their private room for two work events now l with group sizes ranging from 15-30. They provide a menu upon booking to order catering style. In the past we've done sliders, bruschetta, salad, pizzas and risotto appetizers bites. The room can be set up with long or round tables to accommodate the room along with linens. The space also has a coat rack for guests and is located near the restrooms. They also have plenty of parking accommodate large groups.   *Vegetarians: They have a great southwestern black bean burger",

We were staying overnight within crawling distance of Gordon Biersch Brewery - waiting for our son & daughter-in-law to fly in to join us.  They were starving (and thirsty) and so we were actually the first customers of the day (it opens at 11:00 a.m.)!  For a short while, we felt like we owned the place and we were treated so well.    Our waiter was Makeena (I hope I am spelling this right) who was so good to make us feel at home.  As it was our first time here, we loved her suggestions.  3 of the 4 of us love beer and I would have to say the Festbier was a hit!    Food is super - many, many choices from which to pick.  Parking is easy and we will come back the next time we visit Las Vegas.  Thanks and enjoy!",

The beer here is good for what it is, it is predominately German Style Lagers, which are damn hard to brew in the desert by the way. All are well crafted with no off flavors and the Chezch Pilsner is outstanding! I also love the Heffe which is True to style and quite refreshing on those hot Vegas Days! The food is average, nothing spectacular and it is quite pricey. I mostly go for the brews! Service is very good as every employee I have had contact with there has been very pleasant and courteous. This is definitely worth a stop in, especially if staying in any of the hotels on Paradise.",

If you choose to sit at the bar or around the bar area, you can go ahead and find a seat, or a table around it.  Our waitress came by immediately, gave us the menu, plus the happy hour menu, and asked if we like to try one of their beers. I personally don't drink any beer. I really like this place for their bar food! Especially at Happy Hour.  I ordered Fish Tacos. They are perfectly prepared. The sauce is very spicy (good if you like spicy food). It's not listed spicy on the menu, so be prepared. I also ordered pepperoni pizza. They only make personal size pizzas, so everyone can order whatever they like! I love their pizza! Thin crust, baked in a wood-fired oven.  Previously I ordered the California sandwich, it's grilled chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and avocado. Love, love, love their garlic fries! Lots of fresh garlic on it! My other favorite is the New York steak sandwich. Real New York steak on a sub roll.  NY Steak dinner with mashed potato and asparagus. It's a hit and miss! Many times meat is not cooked perfectly. Well, it's not a steakhouse, so I am not going to be outrageous, but for $29 entree, I expect some decent meal.  My BF also tried many different items, too. Sliders from HH menu very good! Only $5.- Their sausages were also very tasty.  For dessert I ordered Strawberry Cheesecake, and it was okay, better than I thought.  Service is always great. Waitresses are very attentive, especially when alcoholic beverages were ordered!   The place is always very loud. Music is always playing on the background.  Television sets are playing sports with captions on. Lots of TV-s everywhere!  Of course the place is always packed, so be prepared.  I like to try their Sunday brunch sometimes, so I am sure we will be back again, sooner than later!",

    "text": "I go to Gordon Biersch a few times a week for lunch, this is my first review after coming a few years. I generally sit at the Bar with my favorites bar tender Andy. Since I come during lunch hours I don't usually order the beer but I have tried some of their in house selections. One of the main reasons I come back to GB is due to their wide  variety of options on the menu, not to mention I can order a full lunch of side selections for under $10 . Side of chicken $3.00 side of mash potatoes $2.50 side of veggies 2.50 . Another sandwich I like to order is the California chicken club or the chicken BLT with garlic fries or replace them with any side.  Their menu is always changing. They even let you order your side of salmon or chicken blackened if you'd like. The burgers are good the salads are descent.  The reason I give it 4 stars is because sometimes you have to know what to order when you come here. The chicken isn't amazing quality sometimes I need to order it well done, and the service sometimes away from the bar can be slow during lunch hours but today the service was great.",

Not once did the wait staff asked us if we were okay, and we even had to track someone down to at least give us some water as we wait, which also took 20 minutes after being asked. I even asked one of the ladies who worked there why my friend's meatless salad took that long to make, and she just stood there looking confused. I wish I was exaggerating, but I don't think I'll ever be coming back here.",

    "text": "So, last Friday my honey and I attended a ballet at The Smith Center.  By the time we picked up the car from the valet it was past 9:30PM and we were STARVING!  All dressed up in our theater finery, we didn't much feel like fast food and the thought came to mind that we had never tried Gordon Biersch on Paradise and it always looked inviting from the outside so we thought, why not?  So glad we took a chance.  We got there about quarter to ten and were quickly seated.  Admittedly, they were not busy at that hour but still, it was nice being attended to so politely and with such courtesy.  Our server came over moments after we were seated and introduced himself to us.  Being that it was our first time there, he went over the menu with us and based on our feedback, made some recommendations for beverage and food.  I ordered one of their craft beers and my sweetie had a glass of wine.  Both were very nice.  For dinner, I ordered the Jambalaya and wifey the Chicken Pasta.  OMG!  Both were so good!  Her Chicken Pasta was full of flavor and my Jambalaya had just the right amount of \"bad\" in it to be wonderful.  Oh, and the desserts?  You know how so many places bring you way too much after a full meal?  Well here, they offer Mini Dessert Tasters, giving you just a few bites to finish off your meal, leaving a sweet taste in your mouth.    Satisfied does not even begin to express how great an experience this was for us.  We will definately put this on our list of prefered places to dine.  I have over 100 girls coming to town early next year and may very well arrange to have this as one of our dining options during the week they are here!  Well done, Mr. Biersch!",

She just kept refilling our drinks and cracking jokes about the situation, and when the bill came, she even put up with dividing it three ways for us. I wish I could remember her name.  The food was also delicious. The selection was amazing- the salads and pastas looked beautiful, and my veggie pizza was among the best I've had. It's an ordinary pizza with a twist: tomato pesto instead of tomato sauce, and topped with artichoke hearts, fresh tomatoes, and lightly sauteed spinach. Soooo good, and I couldn't even finish the whole thing. And unfortunately, the mini fridge in this hotel room is crammed with overpriced booze. No space for my yummo leftovers :(",

I mean, if it's 5:30 and your visitors want to go outside, let them!  Other than its misuse of real estate, this Gordon Biersch is not bad. The environment is really nice. It's pretty busy, so if you're looking for an all-male business crowd, this is the place.   The $5 pizzas during happy hour are pretty tasty. The crust is good.   If you're looking for a good happy hour, and don't need a busy spot, try Satay, across the street. They serve lots of beers and mixed drinks and have outdoor seating.",

Everyone loves the Marzen, it is a perfect beer. I am not a beer fan, but this is the reason why I return to this place. It's August, and they have a tasty Seasonal beer that was perfect.   The Garlic fries here are popular. I arrived at happy hour and tried the potato chip nachos. I don't think nachos should go on anything other than tortilla chips now because of this experience. It was not bad, but I would have been happier if it were regular nachos. They were generous with the sour cream, but skimpy on cheese, pico de gallo, and it didn't have black olives or jalepenos. I understand every place has their way of presenting a food, but I didn't enjoy this particular dish. Anyway, it was only $5.   The pizza was Ok too, a personal pan pizza for $5 is a great deal, especially at a place that has nice ambiance.   I think they are known for their burgers. If I were prepared to have a real meal I would have chosen the sliders, which are pretty tasty. I have had those before.   My suggestion is to come during happy hour, to get the dollar off beers and $5 appetizers. Their regular menu prices are a little pricey, and if you are not a total fan already or just looking for a decent place to have beer, it can seem a little over priced.  I will definitely return to this place, it beats the Madisons up the street!",

I just didn't feel like eating at the sports book at the Hilton since it is mostly junk.  Thankfully they seated us really fast and served our food fast and were out of there in 30 minutes in time to make our show.  I had the classic cobb salad which was fresh and tasty, and the balsamic (that has beer in it) was pretty good.  My husband had the Marzen BBQ chicken sandwich and he inhaled it but later said it was \"just ok.\"  He didn't like the garlic herb fries.  I ate some of them but I prefer my fries with just traditional with sea salt or kosher salt on them.  I wish they would give you the option of not having anything but salt on them.  Anyway I'm giving this place three stars because I liked it (even though husband wasn't thrilled with it) and they served us a decent meal before our Joshua Tree show.",

I am not a beer drinker so I thought I should maybe eat beforehand. A little glad I didn't though. I thought about beer and bar food and even if I was a little right, the choices on their happy hour menu were awesome. We were there at 5pm and learned their happy hour menu was still going on for quite some time. so that is a plus if you like decently priced food and great happy hour beers. I ordered the garlic fries for $5 dollars because I was told I had too. (not to mention the smell of them lured me in when they were being delivered to a neighboring table.) along with a happy hour sized bbq chicken pizza. (so.much.food. for $10 total!) the garlic fries were very intensely flavored and left me warding off vampires for a few days to follow. I ate about 2 slices of the pizza before my stomach started to hurt from the food overload. the service was alright. our waitress was nice at first, but near the end I feel like she was starting to get annoyed with us and our little work meeting. (we were paying customers though!) that turned me off. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. the food was good and the amount of choices i had were even better. I made it home with loads of leftovers.",

But the food just wasn't NEAR what the Gordon Biersch quality used to be.   Calamari. Please, don't serve this. Literally little chewy rubber bands of bland breading. Zero stars.   The famous garlic fries. Way over done and not nearly enough garlic! One star.   Southwestern rolls were yummy. Spicy and full of flavor. Four stars.   Flat bread pizza. Just a complete miss. Nothing artisan or quality or even ho hum about what came out. It was tiny and completely lacking any touch. Zero stars.   The ONLY reason I'm giving this experience two stars was because the server was doing his best to make up for really, really off food.   This is a complete plea with management. You have to review the food coming out of the kitchen as soon as possible. This is NOT Gordon Biersch quality at all!!!",

So I went to GB to grab dinner for us. Ordered 2 entrees to-go from the hostess. She was very cute, very helpful and radiating positive energy.   Lobster & Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes: just the right amount of seasoning to bring out the essence of quality seafood - 5 stars. The boy wanted his red meat - Gorgonzola Bone-In Ribeye: the cut was questionable with a lot of fat, but was cooked well. The side of red skin mashed potatoe was pretty tasty - 3 stars.

The menu is what you expect- burgers, pizza, some chicken/salmon/salad/pasta staples.   Gordon Biersch is a safe familiar environment when you just want a place with craft brews and a kids menu, in short, you are a family of 4 with a couple 12 YO, you love beer, but don't want to fork over $100 for a la carte lunch with root beer served in a $5 bottle to those little treasures of yours.  Only reason I knock off a star is because at some point within last year Gordon Biersch changed their amazing garlic laden shoe string fries into blah, thick cut, little flavor ones while still calling them \"world famous\".  Um, no. World famous ones were the pre-overhaul ones, these fries suck and are beyond blah. Much heartbreak. That and turkey burger needs much work. Otherwise, I'm a fan.",

We were very unhappy with our visit yesterday. It took a VERY long time to get our drinks, to order and to get our food. We ordered appetizers because we anticipated it would take a long time for our meal. Well our meal arrived and NO APPETIZERS. We ended up cancelling the appetizers. I asked for ranch for my fries and was almost done with my dinner by the time it arrived. My friend was going to order more fries and then dessert, but it was taking too long and might not even arrive at our table. The waiters were confused and trying to give us other people's food. The quality of the food was the only redeeming quality, but the service left us very unhappy. Each visit we try to give them a chance to redeem themselves, but unfortunately that has not happened yet. I would have given one star, but the food quality is the reason for the second star!",

We had a decent size dinner party of 20 people in celebration of SEMA Car Show week and I must say the service here was awesome especially trying to handle 20 people and keeping everyone happy and satisfied with their drinks. Since we had a big party we decided to have a certain selective choices in entrees so it makes it easier for everyone to order but the appetizers and salad everyone in the party had.  Here is the list of food we ate: Blue Crab and Artichoke Dip Our Legendary Garlic Fries - Regular Order Classic Pepperoni Pizza Veggie Pizza Caesar  For the entree with had something similar to the Steak frites with garlic fries on the side and changed it up and had gorgonzola butter on the side. This was extra tasty!!!!!  All of our food came out exactly how we ordered and we are definitely going to come back here next year for SEMA.",

Our server Lilly was extremely nice. She was the only one assisting a party of 20 people.   The food was okay not spectacular. My husband's garlic mashed potatoes were hard and cold.  My brother's burger was rare and not well done. So they had to send it back. When then did bring it back everyone else was already finish eating. The even brought it back with the same cold fries.  They salads  were great and filling.  Everything else everyone order was mediocre. My chicken for the GB chicken  and mushrooms was over cooked and dry.  The apple bread pudding was amazing.

This time was different because we ordered appetizers and cheap because of happy hour. We started off with a Mojito for me and a hefeweizen for my love. Beers are a dollar off during happy hour and cocktails are all $5. I ordered the brewers combo because I love the garlic fries and the southwestern egg rolls. Babe ordered calamari and I'm not a fan of it but it wasn't as chewy as I've had it other places. We also go the brats which weren't half price but are always 7.50 on the small plate menu. Definitely a better visit from last time. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very attentive and friendly. Most of the time this place doesn't disappoint",

Good caramelized onions, soft buns, perfectly cooked meat. Bratwurst sliders also very good. Next time I'll skip the Parmesan chips. Too subtle on the cheese flavor for me.

I didnt want to disappoint since I suggested it to my family that was visiting from Iowa.  I called ahead to make arrangements since there was 9 in our party. They were very accomodating and seated us right away, to my surprise since it was a Saturday.  Our waitress was VERY friendly and was very attentive. Our drinks were refilled promptly and without us even having to ask, or having to remind her what we were drinking.   I ordered the Pulled Pork and Garlic Fries and the hubby ordered the Bleu Cheese Burger. We ended up sharing off of each others plates because the food was so good. The garlic fries and ranch are awesome!!!  At the end of our meal we ordered the Warm Apple Bread Pudding w/ whiskey sauce. It was very delicous, the whiskey sauce was the perfect compliment.  I know this is a beer place but I dont drink...I know, how do you go to Vegas and NOT drink, I promise you it can be done LOL  Wish this place wasnt so far away, but def next time I'm in Vegas I will pay them a visit.",

    "text": "I enjoyed myself at this place; the beer was great, the food, not so great, but what a selection! I had the Steak Frites, and it just wasnt a great cut--very chewy. But no worries. It was my first time there, and as I looked around, I thought about what a great first date place this could be, or even a nice place to catch a game sometime. When I had eaten all I could, there was still alot left over. My food sat and sat there until Ifinally asked for a to go container. That's what I got--a container. I had to load it myself. ok...again...no worries. Granted, I was now drunk, but in my 40 odd years on Earth, I have never once forgotten to pay a check. I paid my check (cash), got change, and left a generous tip WITH THAT CHANGE. By the time I get to the parking lot, I'm chased down by one of the bar men, saying sir, u have to pay your bill. I assumed they had me confused with someone else. I asked how much \"I owed\". and he said the amount of my bill which I indeed remembered was the amount I had paid. I went back inside, to show my face to the barmaid who had been taking care of me, and asked if she got the tip. She said she had, but not the bill. How does one get the tip I paid with the change I got from breaking the $100...without remembering breaking the $100?! They \"graciously\" checked her drawer to see if there was an overage, there \"was not\". I don't think that if she took the money, she wouldve put it in her drawer! Rather than concern the police, I paid again (no tip the 2nd time! lol) The warning here is, altho it's a decent place, just pay strict attention when you pay, to whom you pay, and get a receipt! Better yet, pay with credit cards. Otherwise, a decent night can become an embarrassing nightmare.",

This place is a favorite as I can do anything from a quick informal business lunch to a night out with the family here all while accumulating points on my Stein Club membership and enjoying some good beer.  (The Stein Club is the best bargain in town, it was $20 for the base Passport membership and $20 on top of that.- for that I have a locker and name plate holding my Stein for my next visit.  This is a nice ice breaker when bringing guests in, and they all want one as well.  Gordon also has quarterly events for members that includes free food and beer with some additional events thrown in just for fun.  The rewards program has paid for itself and more!) As far as the menu, the lobster tacos and the Jambalaya are always good. For desert, try the bread pudding, even for those who don't usually like bread pudding this one has made fans.",

Some food has been pretty good (cobb salad, bulgogi tacos), other really unremarkable or poor (i.e. red beans and rice).  Just a hit or miss place for food and service.

I am a big fan of the Garlic Fries and the first thing I ordered as an Appetizer was Garlic fries and they are just as good as I get in Sacramento. I was going to order the Blonde Bock since that is the best that Gordon Biersch has and was told that it was removed from the menu. I was upset so I ordered their Heff. I normally don't like it but at the restaurant it was very good. Must be something that the bottle and shipping does to it. I then ordered the Salmon with Garlic Dill sauce and substituted for more Garlic Fries.  (YES THEY ARE THAT GOOD) The salmon was about 25.00 and is pricy but it was tender and good flavored. I was going to order another beer but was driving that night and didn't want to get a buzz going.  I wish that there is one in Sacramento but I would suggest having them even though my total bill came to about 45.00 but that was because of the 18% tip because of being a large party. I highly recommend when you want good food and good drink and with friends.",

The waitress neglected to ask the birthday girl what she wanted to drink. She also failed to notice that one of our guests had accidentally spilled his soda and commented to the spiller \"wow! you're really sucking those down let me grab you another one\" and left him in a wet mess. Out of all 7 of us, only the birthday girl's entree was messed out [talk about some bad birthday luck!]. The salmon she ordered wasn't fully cooked! And she's not a fan of sushi... The waitress didn't apologize and just said \"oh, i'll take it to the kitchen so they can fix it.\" Our birthday girl had a chat with the manager to let him know that we were a little \"miffed\" by the [lack of] service to say the least. The manager said he would send us a new waitress and comp her uncooked salmon. We never got a new waitress and when she brought us the bill she proclaimed \"wow! for some reason my manager gave ya'll a 25% discount! you guys must be stoked!\" ...On the way out, one of our guests overheard her telling a fellow waitress that \"I heard heroin isn't bad for you so I do it from time to time.\"   Just another example of why drugs are bad for you kids.",

Salads arrived about 45 minutes after the program started, and it was almost two hours before the first dinner plate hit the table. When I contacted the manager this was explained away by saying that the presenter requested a 20-minute lag between ordering and preparation (there is a bit of a difference between 20 minutes and almost two hours). Went to another presentation about a week later at another place and we were done with everything (including dessert) in 15 minutes less than it took GB to just bring us our entrees. I can't say how good the food was, because I had to choke mine down in order to get home by 10 PM (from a presentation that began at 6:30). Color me unimpressed.",

The interior is very big and they use chalkboard signage, which seems to be a pretty trendy thing, the dining room has a view of their brewing room, and they had sports playing (World Series) on the TVs above the large bar. The patio is also big, with umbrella tables and what appeared to be heaters (although they weren't needed,yet) and at dusk a bunch of twinkly lights came on, which is fun! While right off a busy street, the patio was fairly quiet and felt secluded from the traffic. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the beer, which is brewed in-house; he helped my husband assemble a flight, and even brought us tastings of the seasonal pumpkin brew without being asked. The Happy Hour menu had plenty of good food choices- I got the California tacos, which are made with beer-battered fish- they were pretty good, but the HappyHour portion is 2 tacos, and they are very small. We also got an order of wings, and they were as good as wings usually are. All wine was $2 off during this time, as well. The only downside was that the families also on the patio didn't care that their children were running around. Not the restaurant's fault, but something to consider if family-friendly isn't what you are looking for. This is a solid choice for after-work drinks, watching the game, or if you need a place for dinner that allows children.",

The beers, when we could get them, were pretty good (mostly Pilsner style).  Pretty poor service.  So poor that we had to get our server Rachel's attention to order beer.  Of course there didn't seem to be a problem when 10, obvious locals, came in and got stellar service.  Over, over, over and over again.  That group even got special attention from several other servers.  While I think this is really cool it sure sends a message to others.  We aren't locals but do come to the Vegas area a couple of time a month for shopping.  Sat for 20 minutes trying to get Rachel's attention but it was like we were in another time zone.  We would ordered more had service been better.  Just sat there thirsty and feeling ignored.  No valid reason to have to beg for service.  As advertised the garlic fries were pretty stellar and the beer pretty tasty.   Due to the poor service it's highly likely that we won't return to this place again.  Way too many choices out there rather than be snubbed.",

The most disappointing thing was that when they brought the wings I ordered, I only was able to eat 1 and 1/2 of another one because of the excessive salt they had. They were un edible and not even masking them with ranch, was I able to eat them! When the server came to pick up the food, I told her I was not able to eat then because of how salty they were and she said okay, like if she didn't care.

    "text": "We went in for a quick bite on my fiancees lunch break. It was both of our first time there. We weren't greeted upon entering and had to look for someone to ask if we seat our selves. We ended up sitting at the bar area. I ordered the steak salad and he ordered the fish and chips. My salad was good, loved the saltiness of the pancetta and creaminess of the gorgonzola cheese. Steak was cooked to the temp I requested but it did seem as if it was a bit on the cold side when brought out. As far as my fiancee's fish and chips...hands down, that was the best he has had in a while, especially in Vegas!! The fish was cooked perfectly, It was nice and cripsy on the outside, not weighted down by oil. The inside was nice and flaky, fish was fresh and not waterlogged like some prefrozen fish some restaurants use. Its been 2 days now and he is still raving about it, even told his co-workers! We will definately be back to try more of their menu.",

Special shoutout to the manager, I think she said her name was Bird. She checked in to make sure we had a great experience and was just really nice.",

I was let down somewhat by their Salmon with Spatzle. I asked for it seared on the outside and raw on the inside, but it was just kind of grey and cooked through. Spatzle were alright but for my high (German) standards, I wasn't stoked or anything. Service was accommodating but nothing special, although I did enjoy the decor and interior of the restaurant, I felt very at ease there. Overall slightly above average experience.",

Located in the really nice Howard Hughes area near Paradise and Flamingo.   When it comes to burgers, I don't get them fancy. I will not be able to comment on the sauces or specialty toppings but I can tell you about the beer and bread for sure!  In this case, both were very tasty. I had it topped with thick applewood smoked bacon and onions. I just dipped in a little ketchup.   I'd heard about the garlic fries and knew I wanted to taste them. They were exceptional. My mouth is watering just writing about them right now. (I will advise you not to have these if you're on a date or headed to one in the following 48 hours because they're very garlicky).   I can't comment on prices because I got lucky and my boss paid.   This was my first visit but will not be my last. Give it a shot!!",

I have seen the menu change throughout the years, but the food remained great through it all. I went back yesterday after a long absence, their blue cheese burger was no longer in the menu, but our server kindly checked with the kitchen and said they could make it. The burger was great as always, but I was somewhat disappointed by the garlic fries, served lukewarm, and the chicken wings had a different, less appealing seasoning. These are two of their signature dishes they shouldn't mess with. The beer was great as always, and the dessert -chocolate budino cake- decent. Our server was nice, but too busy with a larger group, so our service was delayed. I love this place and wish I could rate it a 5, but as it stands it's a 3 now.",

The food menu changes often & the food quality has been on a downward slide lately. They have a huge menu with plenty of apps, entrees and small plates. The flatbread pizza is a menu highlight, and usually there is something worth trying on the seasonal menu. The artichoke/crab dip app and the grilled veggie small salad are among my fave menu items. The beer is the highlight of the menu, & trying a sampler is a great start to the GB experience.  The brewery/restaurant is basically one large open area with a rectangular bar, dining room seating and a large patio as well. The chain's Stein Club members enjoy a slew of goodies and  weekly e-mail deals, as well as a free beer at all seasonal tapping parties. A recent promotion offered a free dessert, app or entree daily during the promo (for the next visit) with Stein Club card swipe. I went the first day and nothing showed up on my receipt. A manager was kind enough to offer me a comp. There always seems to be some issue with their promos, and this makes going there slightly less fun for me.  However, as long as the Stein Club is around, I'll be a GB Stein Club fan for life!",

I was surprised at how good their food is and how pleasant our experience here was. Let's start off with the drinks. My cucumber and basil Collins was incredibly refreshing! I also tried the black & blueberry punch which was sweet and paired really well with my meal. We tried the Asian chicken bites as our appetizer and instantly regretted not upgrading to a large order.  They were sweet and savory and the lemon glaze gave them a zesty kick. For my entree, I had the Almond and Herb Crusted Salmon.  I can confidently say that this is the best salmon dish I've ever had.  It was crispy, tender and exquisitely seasoned.  The garlic mashed potatoes I ordered were chunky and buttery, just how I like them.   My spouse had the Gastropub Burger.  The bacon jam, caramelized onions and gorgonzola cheese in that burger worked really well together and the garlic fries were deliciously seasoned with real garlic. The black forest chocolate cake we had was a little too rich and I don't know that I would have enjoyed it as much without the bourbon soaked cherries, but it was a fantastic meal altogether and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food for a low price.  Our waitress Caitlin was phenomenal and attentive. I can't believe I had never been here before!",

    "text": "Legendary Garlic Fries are outstanding. One of the few places that uses real garlic and not garlic seasoning. The garlic fries are not apart of the happy hour but are well worth it. From the happy hour menu, we ordered the wings (half beer glaze and half Cajun dry rub, both are phenomenal) and the flatbread pizza. Even though we only got three items, we were stuffed. On top of the food, I had their house hefe which is the best hefe I have ever had. The smooth and crisp flavor leaves you refreshed and wanting more. Happy hour is Sunday-Friday 3pm-6pm/10pm-Close and Saturday  open-5pm/10pm-Close. A must try if you're by UNLV and an overall great happy hour experience with friendly staff.",

Getting drinks wasn't the problem - we just couldn't make up our mind with appetizers because we didn't want to order ALL OF THEM.   We ended up with:   * Beer Infused Mussels: the mussels were great, BUT, dipping the bread in the broth upped this dish!   * NOLA Yellowfin Tuna: fresh and went great with the bed of sauce beneath it. The veggies and the pita bread were great cleansers.   * Southwest Eggrolls: These were bigger than the ones I'm used to being served at happy hour on some random place. Wasn't too cheesy and it did well even without the dip.   * Individual Grass-Fed Beef Slider: Hubbers got one (medium) and was pretty good for the price!   * GB Wings (Full Order): Very typical buffalo wings. Went pretty well with our drinks, but nothing too special about it.   * For the life of me, I can't remember the last appetizer we ordered. But 'eh. It was pretty darn good.   Our server, Birdy (aka Aileen - there's an interesting story to her preferred name, by the way, so ask her about it!) was such a cheerful, patient and funny attendant.   Being it happy hour, the prices were more than reasonable.   We all had a wonderful experience! I'd probably make a stop on my next visit!",

I believe that he should learn from his staff, because they  know how to handle the pressure of  a busy night. My partner, my dad and his wife decide to go to the Gordon Biersch this evening. We were advised by the hostess that we would have a wait of 15-20 minutes and that is what we waited. The bartender William was awesome very attentive as well as our server Cameo. She is great with the customers.   There were a few staff members that were stumbling over the mats at the service window. Since our booth was right in front of the service station, I made a comment to the General Manager. All he did was put the other mat over the other mat. So now the staff was stumbling over the mat going the other way.. DAH.. you think that he might have done something else to rectify the problem.   He lacks customer service..He never came back to say thank you for noticing the problem, however his staff did.   But that is OK . I wouldn't really expect it from him anyway...it  looks like he doesn't like his job, doesn't smile,, doesn't have any contact with his customers, very little communication with his staff either.. . From the short time that I was there he does a good job of barking order to his staff in front of his guest.",

Our server did a great job of attempting to keep up but that is an impossible task for one person. Among some of the worst dishes were the rare ahi that looked like an overcooked pork chop, a seafood dish that had salmon from a can and the obligatory missed order of fish tacos for one of my guests. Have been to Gordon Biersch many times around the country and this was pathetic.",

I would definitely recommend this place for people that just want to go out and have a good tasty meal with a slue of great tasting beers to choose from.

After having bad service from the same server two different times we decided to sit in a totally different area, away from the section we prefer, in hopes of having a better service. Well, yesterday was the icing on the cake. As usual the food and music was good. But the service was absolutely horrible. Ilene, needs to either receive further training or consider a job where she doesn't have to interact with others. Not only was her appearance questionable (I.e. dirty shirt, hair not tied back, and just overall unkept ) her lack of customer need awareness was evident. The final straw was when, I once again had to leave our table to get her, I walk up and hear her complaining about my friends and me to another table. But their expression they didn't care to hear about our group asking for, \"too much\" . Finally, we had to request a manager with a different server.",

I dragged a bunch of friends for full price dinner here last night and...  they have replaced their flatbread with what appears to be straight up from the box Matzoh Ball CRACKERS.  I think any toddler is familiar with the difference between crackers and bread.  So $10 for some crackers and tiny scoops of hummus, bruschetta and tapenade is steep. But then I realized my friend had ordered the flatbread pizza and was struggling to eat it because CRACKERS can't support the weight of pizza toppings and sauce.  Another guest politely asked the waiter about the crackers and the server said it was a permanent change.  Here's a permanent change: I will be going to one of the other couple hundred gastro pubs in town with great atmosphere. Or hell, just walk across the street to Firefly for actual tasty food!   And the fresh brewed beer isn't worth it--a lot of the brews are heavy with a syrupy honey taste. bleh.",

I'm not a tourist. I fu*%ing LIVE here. I can go to any number of restaurants in Las Vegas and get a medium rare hamburger. It's like offering sushi grade tuna but only allowing you to get it breaded and fried. Such a waste. it wasn't even my order. It was my friend's order. But the more I think about it the angrier I get. I wouldn't normally even do a review of a chain restaurant, because I figure that's what I get for going to a chain restaurant. But I guess I just wanted you all to know.  Other than that, the food was meh. Not as good as I remembered. Crab artichoke dip was good. Waitress was nice and attentive. I just can't quite get past the kobe burger thing. I can't. Oh and apparently the hostess thought it was proper form to look bored and walk away talking while seating us. Probably didn't help this review to be seated by someone who makes you feel like you're inconveniencing them by wanting to sit down. \"Sorry, are we bothering you?\"",

Although it is not very easy to navigate to its spacious parking lot, it'd be well worth the effort, especially for its famous Happy Hours (3-7pm, AND 9pm-Closing!) - Its Happy Hour menu has a nice selection of tasty dishes, starting at $5), and a variety of German beers, especially their special \"SEASONAL\" beers, are legendary; not to mention its selection of wines and well drinks.   - This location has an impressive brew kettle tower by the front door (much like that at the BJ, Yard House and the Chicago Brewery). Its square bar is huge and classy, as well as comfortable; there are also many bar tables and booths as well. It even has a corner space for occasional live entertainments on special occasions such tapping a new seasonal beer!  The barkeeps and the serving crew are very efficient and friendly, making customers feel comfortable and welcome.  This place seems to be always busy with happy, repeat customers, and many tourists. It is generally quite crowded and loud - a very typical HH atmosphere in a good bar/restaurant. I enjoy very much my frequent happy hours with local friends here, and having occasional dinners with out of town friends.  By the way, please note that their \"Seasonal Beers\", which are NOT listed on the regular drinks menu, could have an usually high alcohol content, so be sure to ask the barkeep of their alcohol contents, just in case you don't want to be OVERLY happy by surprise!

Well I was wrong to pick this place. server was alright not that she was great but she wasn't bad. Definitely need to work on trying to upsell without being too pushy.   Food. We ordered 3 burgers: 2 Cali's and 1 veg. Why would u ask for the temp if its going to come out well done anyways?! And my veggie burger came out way after the other two because I heard them drop the plate. Food runner let me know it was going to be 30 seconds, well the boys had chomped down their burger before I had gotten mine. Anyways I was so upset because I work in a restaurant that I expected them to fix some of their mistakes through some kind of service recovery. Well she did offer dessert but I was upset enough and in a hurry to not take it. Ugh upsetting",

We went last month, and my boyfriend is STILL raving about the Tapas with Flatbread.  The olive tapenade that came in this starter is something I am going to have to try and make myself because he won't stop talking about it.  For dinner, he had a Cesar Salad, and I had the Gorgonzola Pear salad.  He liked his salad, I didn't like mine.  Our service here was poor.  The waitress did not take our order for 30 minutes.  We eventually called another waitress over because we forgot what our waitress looked like and we had to ask who our waitress was.  It seemed like the people sitting behind us had excellent service, so it is a hit-or-miss experience. Cross your fingers and hope for a good server.  We will be back to the Gordon Biersch near us, anyways, because the appetizer and the drinks were excellent.",

Two out of five of us ordered the California chicken! The chicken was so tender just melts in my mouth, and goes perfectly with the sweet potato fries.. i know not everybody loves sweet potato fries like me but they were just the perfect match.

Maybe their beer is outstanding and that's why they can survive in the competitive Vegas restaurant scene, or perhaps it's their relatively close proximity to the Las Vegas Convention Center and the general lack of good restaurants in the area.

Each item we ordered had a special twist on it including the house made garlic mashed potatoes and famous fries (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)   I had the sausage platter, made in house and it was some of the most amazing sausage I've ever had. My boyfriend had the brewers steak with mushroom marzen. The steak was extremely tender and flavorful. Although it wasn't medium rare as requested it, it was still so delicious my boyfriend didn't want to send it back.   The atmosphere was rustic and had a open feel to it. They have a great outdoor seating area, but inside is just as good. The lighting and decorations add to the experience, especially the brewery equipment.   Our waiter, Michael was also incredible. He had some great recommendations and really added to the atmosphere of the place. We really enjoyed his service and comedy.",

I'm not a huge beer drinker, nor do I like sweet drinks, BUT this particular brew was really on point.

For a Thursday night, the place was pretty packed, but there was no wait. We just missed happy hour that ended at six, which was kind of a bummer. The cucumber tom collins was great. Light, refreshing, and sweet. Still had a kick too. Our server recommended it.  Blue crab artichoke dip was amazing! Chunks of real crab meat and hot cheesy goodnes. Theres not nearly enough pita and crackers, but the server noticed half way through and offered additional which we of course jumped on. The seafood cobb was crisp, fresh, and full of fresh tender crab and shrimp. The jalapeno ranch was thick, and rich with a hint of smokiness. Steak was decent size and cooked perfect, nice flavor. Veggies not overcooked just the right crunch. The only thing that was missing was a good dessert. They didnt have much of a variety and nothing really appealed to me.",

I got the sausage sampler [and why not I am in Vegas after all!].  It was delish!!!  Homemade mustards were to die for.  And the red smashed potatoes with kraut, pork and onions was AMAZING.  My friend kept stealing bites of my mashed potatoes b/c he liked it so much.  I had to be on the defense for the fork war that was going on.  You can't find something on the menu here you have BIG issues.  It's almost overwhelming when you open it up there's a little bit of everything- seafood, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, German fare, burgers, Asian, etc you the idea  They do have low calorie options as well; however,  I did not participate in them on this experience.  Beer sampler is a steal at $5.75 esp when a regular beer is $5.25",

I may be a little biased because we've gotten to know the bartenders and some of the servers--I feel like I'm a part of \"Cheers\" walking in here! lol  I give it 5 stars mostly because it's everything you should expect from one of these bar/restaurants--bar food and booze.  Love the bartenders--Kala, Matt, Natalia and Billy--they're pretty awesome and always remember our usuals.  We're almost always at the bar, so I'm not sure what service is like at the tables, but I hear it's kind of so-so.    The beer is pretty good.  Not a huge selection, because they like to showcase their own craft beers.  I really enjoy the food.  My favorites have gotta be the fried artichokes, wedge salad with blue cheese, the veggie pizza, veggie tacos, fish tacos, and the garlic fries! MMM!  I'd say it's moderately priced.  I know they have a happy hour, too, so that's fun.  Overall, I'd say it's a great place to come in, grab a drink, eat and hang out with coworkers.  Plus they have televisions all around the bar, so they get bonus points for that! :)",

    "text": "Overall a pleasant dinner with my co-worker from work this past Monday.  Sat at the bar for immediate accommodation, found the service hit and miss, sometimes she was ready at the right time and in other cases you'd have to wait for a while with an empty drink (which any bartender would I'm sure rather have topped off for any willing patron).  An appetizer I ordered since I was famished also came so late it might as well have come with the meal itself, which defeated the purpose.    Amber lager tasted excellent, so I did quality assurance a couple times, for consistency's sake.  They were equal, so they get a pass.  Location is easily spotted and parking was more than plenty for when we visited.  Had a seafood pasta which on paper sounded busy, but worked well enough in reality.    Debating a 3 star vs. 4 star just because of the service, but the drinks were tasty and the food was fine, so I'll chalk it up to bad luck in this case and not the norm for the place.  Two things which have nothing to do with anything, but are memorable nonetheless.  The full size mirror in the men's room is mounted at an offset downward angle, which after you've had a couple beers messes with your balance.  Thanks for nothing.  Also, and this must just be Vegas, there was a cigarette vending machine just outside that restroom.  The last time I saw one of those in CA was over a decade ago.  Crazy.",

    "text": "Not sure where to start with this. My rating level fluctuated all night due to a variety of influences, but I wound up being \"a fan\" by the end.  The service was pretty mediocre. Yeah, it was busy since it was St. Patrick's Day and a Saturday night to boot, but I still have reasonable expectations. It seemed like forever for them to bring food out, and my friend's whiskey on the rocks took way longer than the other drinks for no good reason. We also had to ask twice for the vegetarian menu, and this was for the birthday boy no less. Finally, it took them forever for them to bring us our check even though it was clear that we had finished our food. You know, based on them clearing out our empty plates and whatnot.  However, I did enjoy my half-liter (standard size, apparently) of Marzen beer, and the food was pretty decent (but nothing special) overall. My kobe burger was nothing special, so I'd recommend that you pick one of the other burgers instead. The garlic fries were delicious though, the fish portion of the fish and chips was really nice, and the potato chips nacho appetizer that my friends were sharing wasn't bad.  Even so, this would probably be a three-star review if it wasn't for one thing: they had my Sharks game playing on TV. We were playing the Red Wings, and a couple of their fans just so happened to be sitting near our section and had the TV tuned in to the game. Now this happened to be on the NBC Sports Network and wasn't a legit regional broadcast, and it wasn't in HD for whatever reason, but I'm still very happy that I caught the game because we won in overtime and managed to climb back into position for a playoff spot down the stretch.  I don't think I'd pick this place over Yard House if I had the choice in the future, but I still had a good time here, and I think most people can enjoy this place too.",

Ambiance was nice, service was passable, menu is a tremendous value (~$15 entrees), menu variety is decent and the food was better than expected for a brewpub style restaurant. Their menu is made fresh, to order and you can taste that difference.  There wasn't anything that was absolutely wowing but after leaving we found ourselves asking why we don't go there more often.",

The food is all great, but my absolute favorite is their fresh, from scratch, veggie burger made in house. Most places will serve you processed veggie burgers that they receive frozen (like garden burger, Boca, beyond, impossible), but not Gordon Biersch and you can definitely taste the difference! Their garlic fries on the side are amazing too. Their seasonal draft Maibock is delicious as well and when they don't have that, Marzen is a great substitute. My only complaint is they got rid of their yummy sauces like chipotle mayo and thousand island. And they closed their location on the west side which was a lot closer to home.   I sincerely hope they open another location closer to the west side. Just one location in this crazy city isn't enough!",

Happy hour prices are ridiculously awesome, and with buy one get one entrees, we were pretty damned happy!  Happy hour specials: We ordered a $3 21 oz tangelo hefe beer, which was delightful, and a $6 mai tai that was DELICIOUS.   We also ordered a $9 blue crab and artichoke appetizer that was so good I burned the roof of my mouth because I couldn't wait for it to cool down a little.  My one criticism would be that there wasn't enough bread/chips.  Not to worry though, I ate the remaining dip with a spoon, it was that good.  For our entrees, we decided on the Cesar salad with grilled salmon for me, and the seafood Cobb salad for my love, we ordered both with the dressing on the side.  My Cesar was awesome.  The salmon was absolute perfection, and the rest of the salad was as expected:  the dressing was good, and they gave me enough without it being overdressed.    The seafood Cobb was great.  The chef forgot the egg, but our server was super sweet and brought it over right away after we asked.  We took the avocado off for my allergy, but the rest of it was really nice.    Service was polite and friendly, if not overly fast, but it was pretty busy, and we didn't mind.   I definitely plan to go back for more happy hour specials!!",

Easily got a seat at the bar and were helped quite promptly.  I need to come here for happy hour when I don't have plans because how can you pass up $3 beers and cheap appetizers??  We got the southwest nachos for $7 and it was a really good size, easily shareable.  These are a bit different than your average nachos.  They are made with fried wontons rather than chips which gives the whole dish a nice airy bite.  Accompanied with all of the fixings including a cheese sauce and a ranch sauce on the side, these nachos were a surprising treat, not what we were expecting, but a dish that was enjoyed nonetheless.",

However, when the manager came out, she talked to us in a very condescending and unapologetic manner, even though it was an obvious mistake they made.   And here's the thing. We still tipped the waitress 20% because even though it was probably originally her mistake, she had a very positive and accommodating attitude and was interested in getting the problem fixed without a bad attitude. On the other hand, the poor attitude and people skills from the manager is the reason for this 2-star review.",

Then my niece and I went inside to use the restroom and we discovered a whole different scene in there. We both instantly had to cover our ears. There was a live band playing so loud you couldn't even hear the person next to you talking. Absolutely no need for it to be that loud except maybe because it was an older crowd and perhaps they needed to check their hearing aids. People were blocking the aisle way to watch the band.

    "text": "In Las Vegas for the WSOP for 10 days. Took a couple days off here and there, fortunately falling on days the US Women's World Cup quarter finals and semi finals were being played.  Went to Gordon Biersch both days. On the first day, had my favorite, the ahi tuna nachos....these are a meal in themselves. Also had a flight, and a couple beers while watching the match between the US and France. Andy, the bartender was awesome and turned the volume on for the TV during the match and the whole bar was riveted to it.  Since the semifinal against England was being played around lunch time again , I decided to go back to Gordon Biersch for lunch and have a pizza and a couple beers while watching soccer again. The bartender, Mike, was great and got my custom pizza ordered and it came out very quick.  The only reason this rating isn't 5 stars is because the shift supervisor, Nick, refused to turn on the volume for the soccer game despite several patrons' requests for the sound during the match. Finally, at least on the TV facing me, Mike turned the volume on for the second half of the match, and the patrons on our side of the bar thoroughly enjoyed the remainder of the win by the US Women's team (Thanks Mike!).   Nick's explanation for not allowing the volume to be turned on, was that it wasn't a championship game, and that then the volume for other matches would have to be turned on as well. Well with there only being 2 more matches remaining in the World Cup, I don't see the issue, especially since it's the World Cup  and it only happens every 4 years,  and it the US team!!!!",

The server came over less than 5 minutes asking for drink orders(plus in my book). Once we finally figured out what to order the food came out less than 20 minutes! Mind you me and my boyfriend were hungry so that was perfect timing. Everything was great up until I noticed the manager I suppose go around to every table to make sure everyone was being taken cared of. We sat far out in the opening so missing our table was impossible. She skipped our table and did not acknowledge us. Maybe because we look like kids? I am not sure, it would be hard to go with the fact that she just did not see us because we are far out in the opening. I hope that doesn't boil down to picking and choosing who you'd like to check on and who you do not want to just go over and speak with. Every little thing counts with me and I just thought that wasn't nice of her. Other than that the food was amazing :).",

They're not busy, in fact, almost empty, yet I was told the kitchen was too backed up.  The manager dropped off the food and made no mention of it taking over an hour. I don't expect anything other than just a \"sorry\" in passing, but not even a word.  The food alone is maybe a 3 star. Definitely a disappointing meal. Don't fall for the \"legendary garlic fries\" as they're literally just fries with a ridiculous amount of garlic on top of them.  I have to give the server credit for recognizing their screw up. She comped the meal and wouldn't let me pay despite telling her it was not necessary.  Usually I'll give places a second chance, but I won't be going back anytime soon.",

The brew: Marzen smooth and full of flavor my fave, my friend had their Hefenweizen he said it was awesome, next level kinda stuff :) Fully stocked bar, meant we had a round of Don Julio to top it off.

You can skip everything else on the menu but not the garlic fries. They use fresh garlic...dragon breath! After they took my go-to dish off the menu (blackened Mahi sandwich), I felt so lost and unable to choose what's good here. Then, they put it back on the menu...talk about playing with my emotions! Their hummus and calamari are quite good.  Beer-wise, I like their Hefeweizen (fruity, sweet wheat beer) and Blonde Bock (heavy, creamy and filling). You'll end up wanting more garlic fries.  This place is more like 3.5. 5 stars for the garlic fries, 3 stars for the service and 2.5 stars for the entire menu and value.",

Our server Lonnie was the ONLY bright spot. The entire room was given menus and water, and we were LAST to receive them. It must be nice to be so arrogant, that you don't care about money. I will laugh when this place goes out of business. They have no business being in business. There's no sense of urgency and customer service whatsoever. The place wasn't as busy as they normally are. These people just don't care. NEVER AGAIN!!!! I'll go to the Boulevard Bar and Grille where I can get waited on and where I matter. What's the point of getting up on a Sunday morning early just to be ignored so all the tables around he can get water and menus and I have nothing. No thank you.  The waiter insisted I at least have their jalapeno ranch dressing on the side when I did not want it at all. He pushed even further and insisted I try it when I told him I didn't want it in the first place. About 30 minutes later I threw up. All I could taste was that damn dressing that I didn't want in the first place! That was the last straw for me so I left. I wasn't read it on the way out and nor was I greeted on the way in. This place reeks of arrogance. The only things that were good with the music and the company. Other than that I should've stayed home. It's not worth the 45 minute drive from sunrise Mountain.",

The restaurant itself is clean and modern. Hostess was friendly, as was our waitress.   There are many options, which is a bonus anywhere you go. My boyfriend ordered a 12 oz steak, garlic mashed potatoes, and rice pilaf for $23.99. I ordered the Artisan grilled cheese with their signature garlic fries for $9.50. I thought it would be fairly small for the price but was SHOCKED when the waitress brought it out. Not only was the sandwich a good portion, but it was also delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well, and the sides were both a good amount.  My only complaints were that the waitress didn't ask us if we wanted refills until we were done eating. Also, the garlic fries are EXTREMELY garlicky and had excess oil. I love garlic a lot, but it was a bit much for me. If you're not a huge fan or if you're not used to garlic, don't order the garlic fries.   We don't drink alcohol, so we can't speak for that, but everything else was fantastic.",

I saw him having attitude with the waitress. It wasn't just this. It was his tone. I asked the waitress why he was so rude and her reply was \"that's Ricardo being Ricardo\" Why have an employee that you can even say that about.

Additionally, we had our private dining room (the Marzen room), got to take a private tour of the brewery, and thoroughly enjoyed our two hour open bar!  Best of all, this VIP-style experience was reasonably priced (under $100 pp, including all taxes and tips!).

We were able to put in a drink order, but received them about 15 minutes later, and was also missing 1 water that was requested alongside the coffee porter. We were with the group for about an hour - a time frame in which I only managed to get and finish 1 drink order in. Although I honestly did want to put in a food order. Managed to be able to flag our server for the check, but I did have one co-worker literally go to the bar to request his check because it had been too long before we saw any server come to the table.  Maybe I'll just order at the bar ahead of time and request it be brought to the table like a fellow co-worker did.",

My colleague ordered the Seafood Cobb and received Shrimp Tacos.  I  had to remove the bottom of my sandwhich bun because it was hard as a rock.

Overcooked and dry.  Meh.  Did I mention that the waitress acted as though she was doing us a favor by serving us?  I'm sure she had better things to do...   Not a bad experience. But wouldn't go back.",

There were tiny bits of undercooked roux floating about my bisque.  My boyfriend got a steak med. rare and it came out WAY overcooked; I understand if it was a whole steak that was sent out, but he had ordered a flat-iron streak which is served pre-sliced.

    "text": "If you've lived in Vegas for any length of time you have probably been invited to join a group of coworkers for Happy Hour at Gordon Biersch at some point. I've been there countless times in the 9+ years I've lived here for going away parties, or just random group gatherings, but never gave much thought to the quality of the food. So when I was recently sent over there during the day for another work related item, the suggestion arose for me to take the opportunity and check out the burger. I can't say anyone has mentioned their burger to me throughout my time as 'burger blogger', so I was a bit skeptical by this idea but gladly took on the challenge as I always do.  There are two Biersch locations in town, the long standing one on Paradise near the airport, and a newer location in Summerlin. I actually haven't been to the one in Summerlin because there are far better selections in the area if I'm going to bother eating around there. The same could be said for the Paradise location, but it's probably the cheaper of the touristy selections around there. The exterior of the restaurant is still pretty cool, but the interior's 'brewery' look is starting to seem a bit dated. Whether you're there for lunch or dinner the place is always fairly populated between the close proximity to convention halls and hotels as well as the adjacent office parks. There are plenty of seats around the bar/lounge, as well as booths and tables both inside and out. The menu is all over the place with appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, desserts, you name it. While they may not offer the healthiest options, they do have a decent Happy Hour with a few good snacks.  While pondering which of their Knife & Fork Burgers to try the waitress suggested an off-the-menu but highly popular Swiss and mushroom burger, which also happens to be one of my favorites so I jumped on it. Served with a large knife skewered through it, the massive burger looked great upon arrival. The flaky, gooey bun was quite good and very well-proportioned to the meat. The patty seemed to be pre-formed, but of good quality; the char flavor was present upon the first few bites but got a little lost with everything else once I really got into it. The mushrooms had great flavor, and the Swiss was melted well but not incredibly present. Overall it was very juicy, flavorful, and a huge surprise.  Their 'legendary' fries are good, but actually a bit too garlicky for me. Also the whole batch was a bit undercooked and soggy so they weren't the best example that day. You get a huge portion, easily enough for two people if you're looking to share. $11.50 for this burger is a great deal considering its size, quality, large portion of fries, and proximity to convention-oriented hotels. While I hate spending $2.95 for an iced tea, $15.62 is still not a bad deal for everything you get. Swap that with a beer and you've got yourself a pretty good meal.",

The party room we were in had the ac blasting and we all had our coats on while eating despite asking if the ac could be turned down which never was.  The French fries were old and cold and we asked for new ones only to have the ones sent back reheated in a microwave.  So disappointing!  The fish had waaaaay too much breading and had absolutely no flavor.  Their homemade root beer is missing the 'root' part because it tasted horrible and was sent back as well.  I can see why I lived here for 3 years and never went.  I will never go back.  They did have a live band which was cool.  Don't waste your time, stay home and cook.",

I had the Strawberry Soda (very similar to a Mojito) and it was SUPER. I had more than one...I tried about 4 other drinks on their mixed drink menu, but none of the others can I remember. I would definitely go back next year!",

    "text": "Gordon Biersch is close to a hotel I use when in Vegas on business. I've eaten here several times, over a two-year period, and used to like the place. But, my recent experiences have been disappointing.  Things got off to a poor start when we were seated at an unstable table that rocked like a small boat on the high seas.  We were told that was the only available table...but it wasn't.  We insisted on being reseated and another table became magically available after we challenged the \"no other tables\" explanation.  We were re seated, and ordered a couple of their in-house microbrews. The beers were OK but lacked character, perhaps my memories of their beer were incorrect, or perhaps they have a new brewmeister..maybe new recipes?   I ordered the new york steak and tempura shrimp combo and...well...the tempura shrimp are not like the light flakey  tempura you might find in a Japanese place. Gordon Biersch \"tempura\" seems to be  just battered shrimp, and the batter is little better than what you might find at a fast food place. The steak was more or less an Applebee's quality steak, and the garlic mashers were average at best.  I realize the prices here are less than on the strip...but come on.  You can beat Applebee's for God's sake.  Still, the place is conveniently located, so we went back again, a couple nights after our mediocre experience, hoping for a better outcome.    Nope.  This time the service was poor and their signature KOBE burger came well done when ordered medium rare. We had to get up and find our waiter to order a replacement.  Even the replacement burger was a disappointment:  A perfectly formed hockey puck of beef (read made in a burger press), a slice of cheese that looked like a Kraft single, a very basic bun, a tiny side of fries and not much else.  We then had to ask twice for some ketchup for the fries. When the best thing you can say about a $14 burger is \"the bun was fresh\" it's not a good value.  All in all, I see no reason to give them a 5th chance.",

Our server seemed scared when he saw all of the kiddos in our group..which I found pretty funny. That apparently effected him through out the meal since he was not doing a very good job. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with some really yummy garlic fries. The burger was done proper and was really fresh as far as the toppings went. Those fries were addicting. We also had a plate of homemade potato chips that are loaded with bacon & cheese..those were even better than the fries. They get 5 stars! So if you go there and get \"Skippy\" the waiter..good luck. LOL Lets just hope he was having an off day... Oh..the beer I had was perfect...love the beer here!",

I have never had empty plates with shells left on the table the entire meal much less having to beg to get water glasses refilled.

    "text": "BIERLY EDIBLE  Here's the sad part of this review: I use to love this restaurant brand. I ate at my first one during Spring Training in AZ near the ASU campus. It was a tradition for us all to go there yearly for dinner & drinks and we always had a great time. Then on flights through SFO I would go and grab some of their famous garlic fries. I'm sure my airplane travel neighbors loved that as was we flew to China. Recently we had a team dinner here at the Vegas location and it was anything but good.   I am not sure what has happen but the food is just terrible. I know they brew the beer fresh but why can't the food be fresh too. I'm not sure how this place is going to survive because there is just too much good food out there to be wasted on this stuff.   We ordered a ton of apps and they were worse then warmed up Costco samples. The sad part is that we were paying for these & Costco samples are free. If I was the chef that designed this menu, then I would be embarrassed to tell anyone I even worked on it. The visit here left enough of a bad taste in my mouth that I may never ever visit another one of these chains again.   For my entree I ordered the tuna blue and it was the weirdest piece of tuna I've ever had. The colors were not vibrant at all. It was probably the saddest piece fish I've ever eaten. My friend & fellow Yelper kept saying, \"Your fish doesn't look right!\" I used his famous line on him saying, \"Never order fish in a desert!\" It was the only way I could admit to my ordering mistake. I was just trying to be healthy. Guess what comes with my fish as a side?  Garlic Fries! Because noting says raw fish side more then garlic fries. Not!!! The kitchen couldn't even get them right. There was not a single chunk of garlic on my whole dish of fries. In the past this dish would be so garlicky that you couldn't talk to people for days. Not anymore. They were basically French fries missing any of its past glory. How can a restaurant go backwards on one of their signature dishes? It just doesn't make sense. All I know is that this place doesn't care about its food anymore. The temperature of the food was not hot which meant my dish was sitting while the other 12 dishes in my group were being made. It's not cool to send back a dish when you are trying to eat as a team.   My buddy Tony M got the beef medallions and he really didn't care for it. Another co-worker across from us cut up her swordfish and didn't even eat it. She said it was really dry. It's sad to have a group meal where the food is pretty much tasteless and inedible. I really wish we would have gone to another place.   The only app that was halfway good was the Southwest egg roll but honestly anything deep fried is really good. Except for the deep fried crab balls which were really crabby. I don't like eating crab which tastes like the sea. These things were really fishy. In fact, if I threw it into the ocean I am sure a fish would throw it back at me. The fried calamari was also not really good either. There was nothing fresh about it. The rings were really thin and it was more batter then actual fish inside.   Service was good. Our waitress did a nice job of serving us except she forgot to bring our chicken wings. I didn't get the bill so I'm not sure if we charged for them too. Hopefully another table enjoyed a couple of baskets of wings. I felt bad for one of the guys in our group. He didn't get his food until 10 minutes after we got ours. Which means the chef didn't make it or the waitress forgot to order it.    If you come here then just stick to the bier. It is the only thing that is made in house. The food is an afterthought and the chefs don't really care. Food needs to be made with love and passion but that is not going to happen here. Stay away from the food.",

Located right by the strip on Paradise Road, this place is easy to access even though you might get some traffic on your way there at rush hour. The restaurant offers a very large parking lot, and I had no problem finding a spot.  Service was a little slow that day, but the food we were served was pretty good and definitely worth it for the price we paid. I had the artisan salami pizza for $8.50 (Happy Hour price) along with drinks, and the value of all of it was very good given how little we ended up paying. Definitely a great Happy Hour place in Las Vegas.  In the end, I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a good Happy Hour close to the strip. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

    "text": "This restaurant is located in the Hughes Center office complex and given its convenient location to the offices there, I've had many a business lunch in this location.  The food is good and they're a good spot for lunch unless there is a convention going on in which case they are a lot busier and service tends to slow down.    Seating at the bar or high tops around the bar is a quick and easy solution for solo or couple diners.  They have several tvs going with whatever big sport events are on at the time and/or financial news if nothing else is happening.    My biggest problem with Gordon Biersch is something that many people probably enjoy--they frequently change the menu--at least once a quarter if not more.  I joke that I have to re-read the menu every time I go because it changes so often.  The reason I don't like it is that some of my favorite dishes are no longer on the menu.  One my favorite meals here is the Housemade Tacos.    GB is famous for its garlic fries, but for those of you who don't want garlic breath all day, the fries are just as good without the garlic.  Overall, this is a good place that I would recommend for lunch or dinner.",

The beer was very good, especially since some breweries tend to serve their oldest/worst beers during inexpensive happy hours. There were plenty of sports on the tvs, and they also have patio seating. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. Kinda hard to find being behind Bahama Breeze off Paradise, but we spent $50 for dinner and beers, which is GREAT for Vegas!  If you have the chance to sit by the bar on a Saturday, make sure John is your server. He is a master of his craft and super friendly!!",

    "text": "I love coming here for their burgers.  Anyone who toasts their buns is alright by me.  However today my burger was more like a slider. We decided to come here after work to kill some time because we didn't want to drive in the monsoon.  Our waitress was less than enthused to wait on us.  She spent quite a bit of time talking to the table next to us.  It appeared that the one young lady worked there and maybe it was her day off because I saw a cook also come out and chit chat with her.   Anyways....I asked for water when she had a moment.  That moment was 10 minutes later.  She only had 3 tables so not quite sure why that took so long.  Our food arrives and I promise you it was so much bun and a lil baby patty (I never remember to take a picture until half way thru or at the end after I'm done).  I've never had a burger that small at GB.  I was very disappointed and was even more disappointed with our waitress who came by to see if our food was ok but didn't really give us a chance to comment because it was a drive-by how's everything, meaning she said it as she kept walking.  But then a cutie comes in and sat behind us and she was so chipper and happy go lucky.  I interrupted to ask for another coke because there was enough garlic on my fries to put on 4 other dishes.  12 minutes later I got my coke.  I watched her go in the back, talk to the  someone and talk and talk and then I saw my coke in hand but then she began talking to 2 other employees right in front of the bar.  I was very close to going to take it out of her hands myself because I was so thirsty from all the garlic.   My friend ordered the cod fish and chips I believe.  She said it was ok.  Not good, not bad. Got the bill and after 11 minutes of waiting for my friends change, we were finally able to leave.  Ive been to this location many times as I work down the street on Howard Hughes and I've never had service this poor.",

    "text": "Ah...finally a brewery in Las Vegas! So happy we found this place, I love trying new stout beers!   Came here during happy hour which is from 3:30-6:30pm. Not quite sure if that's their only happy hour. Started off with the oatmeal stout beer, which I believe is a limited beer. They have different beers every few weeks depending on what they have in stock. For our appetizer, we had the Southwest wonton nachos which is super big for an appetizer! It's served with wonton chips, black beans, red onions, guacamole, and tomatoes. There's a sauce that's swirled in it, that honestly is everything!   For my entree I had the smoked chicken and mushroom pasta. So yummy!!!! I love pasta, but I'm usually very picky with it because I like a good cream sauce, but not too saucey, if that makes any sense. And this pasta is just that! Comes with shrimp and chicken and a bit of Parmesan which is just perfect! My boyfriend ordered the California chicken sandwich with a side of garlic fries. Those garlic fries.....so so good! The fries are perfectly cooked with bits of garlic and Parmesan. Just perfect.   After we got our tab, our server offered us a stamp card which allows you to accumulate points everytime you come in, and once you reach a certain amount of points, you can turn them into cash towards your next bill! We so loved this! Thank you Gordon!",

While waiting for our main courses the bartender was basically screaming behind us we could barely have our own convo   Finally course my kabob was fine no complaints my friends hamburger completely not cooked right  but we don't like to complain and we were so hungry he ate is anyways my friends steak was cooked fine but there was more fat then meat smh   We had asked for our checks separated and the waitress snatched it back and made the most ugliest face all of us were like wow she must hate her job!!

They kept talking together and when they finally realized we walked in, they looked kind of pissed they had to interrupt their conversation to take care of us. I love the industrial look of this place. And the fact they're brewing their own beers. Our server was friendly but not really paying attention. He messed up with our order and one out of our three orders came wrong. Then my portion of sweet potato fries came out way smaller than the others. When I told him that, he said he would bring some more as he also noticed it. Never made it to the table though. The food is very good and served in a good size (except for my fries...). Very tasty. When it came for us to leave, same thing, the two hosts didn't even care about responding to our goodbyes...  I will definitely go back someday when I have more time. Meanwhile I strongly suggest they improve on their staff.",

As an afternoon visitor I'm impressed by the female bartenders, upbeat and remember your favorite beer, especially the longest serving one. Male bartender not so much.",

    "text": "First off, they have a few very good brews.  Their Belgian IPA is actually very good (not widely brewed in the area) and their Marzen is a solid interpretation.  Gordon Biersch has become pretty big in Las Vegas and they sell by the cases in many stores so it is much more than a restaurant.  Still I like a good beer and can respect their recipe for a few types.  Now we move on to the food side of the company.  I went for lunch a few months ago.  The best part of the meal was the complimentary taster of their Belgian IPA (as mentioned before, delicious).  I then had a chicken sandwich that tasted like any other sandwich at any other pub/restaurant.    I would definitely come back to Gordon Biersch because I like the vibe of the restaurant, they have some solid beer varieties, the beer is not too expensive, and they have TVs to watch some sports.  Still, the food is not the magnet of this restaurant's appeal.",

    "text": "After living in this area for so long, I finally tried Gordon Biersch. Of course what intrigued me to come was the happy hour menu. My friend and I came around 10 at night on a Wednesday. There was a private party going on at one side of the bar area so it made it seem sort of packed. Other than that I think the amount of people there was the standard small size crowd for a week night. Unlike Yard House, the happy hour here is only for the bar area. So I guess I can't bring my friends who aren't of age yet.  First we received our drinks, I ordered the Marzen beer and she ordered a mojito.  I'm kind of embarrassed to write this, but I am honestly not a beer drinker and it tasted normal to me?  I only drank a few sips and that was it! hahaha.  I feel like I wasted the other 3/4 that was left. Oh well, good thing we bought it at happy hour price. My friend also said her mojito was just \"okay.\" After she tasted her drink she wished she had the Dragon fruit strawberry mojito which sounded 10 x better than the boring classic. As for the food, we ordered the Southwest Combo and calamari. I really enjoyed the garlic fires because of the Parmesan cheese and the garlic flavored oil drizzled on top. I also thought the calamari, was pretty standard. However, I am not a fan of the other items that came with the Southwest Combo. The egg rolls was on the verge of having soggy wrapper and the pork sliders were nothing special. We order the mini warm apple bread pudding for dessert. It was delicious especially the contrast of textures and flavors between the bread, caramel, and apple. If you want dessert but don't have enough room for a normal size one, the mini is perfect. I really want to come here again to try other items on the HH menu, but I don't know if it's worth it knowing other places (ie Yard House) have better selection, quality, and prices. Therefore 3 stars.",

    "text": "Eeeeh. What can I really say about Gordon Biersch. Below expectations? Poor value?  First thing - our bartender had to say \"bro\" every couple seconds. Drove me batty. Also had no clue what an IBU was and tried steering me away from their seasonal beer because it \"comes in a smaller glass\" (it was a 10%abv beer. of course its not served in a larger glass). I'm not looking for cicerone level knowledge - but come on... It's a brewery/restaurant.   The beer: I was very underwhelmed. I tried both their standard IPA and season IPA - not impressed. Ended up ordering their Pilsner (hard to mess up a pilsner). Also along side grabbed a bloody mary. The bloody was nothing to get excited about but I wasn't expecting anything really from it. However - for a place that is a \"brewery\" I expected the beers to be quite a bit better. Nothing really to write home about, very round and bland. Also expected the bartenders to at least have SOME beer knowledge.  Food: The food was actually really good! I had the crab/artichoke dip and the tenderloin sliders. Food temp was great! Food quality was great! I would come back for the food over anything else.  Value: When I visited Gordon Biersch I came for happy hour. For two apps/small plates, one beer and one bloody my tab came to $40. Not exactly \"happy hour\" pricing - despite having ordered items that were supposed to be \"happy hour\". Price point was the biggest let-down of all actually. At $40 for a beer, well vodka drink and two apps - you can dine at some phenomenal restaurants here in Vegas. This clearly is not one of them.  The food its self is good - but at the price point there is much better. Because of the poor value I would probably not try this place again.",

The food I had - some sliders, a spinach salad, and a pulled port sandwich - was all delicious. The prices were a little on this high side, but nothing unreasonable or unexpected for the area.  The beers were a little uninspiring, but it's possible that my bar is set too high for mass-produced microbrews. I recommend the Marzen and the Schwarzbier - definitely the two best ones of the bunch.  I enjoyed this restaurant and would definitely go back if it was so convenient - but I'm not sure it's really worth going out of the way for.",

The beers they brew there are all pretty good, although some of them are pretty strong and they sneak up on you.  I have found myself stumbling back across the street more than once because of them.    I especially like going to the Gordon Biersch on Sunday afternoons.  They usually have a band and the place is always filled with these cool locals who must come here after church.  The odd thing is, they are always dressed a little like pimps or something.  I've never seen anything like it before.  But it is cool as hell because everyone there always seems to be having a good time. But I always feel a little under-dressed.  Where would one buy a purple velvet suit anyway?  I've had almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.  The service has always been great.  I have been to other GBBC locations and this one sets the standard.",

    "text": "The good:  We were promptly seated by a friendly hostess. Our waiter (Jose) was excellent; prompt, professional, personable. He alerted us that the kitchen was running \"a little slow\" so I put in an order for a calamari appetizer before we looked at the menus.   The bad: The calamari...without exception, the worst restaurant offering of calamari I've ever had. To be clear: It arrived hot and was served with two \"sauces.\"  The rings and tentacles were either  \"hard\" or very chewy...depending on whether you picked a thin ring (hard and without flavor of any kind unless you dipped it in the sauce) or if you picked the tentacles, then you got an equally tasteless morsel....only chewy instead of hard.   I'm confident they can find a better supplier of calamari than the one they're using. Restaurant management should be all over this, it is a supplier issue not a cooking or wait staff issue.  My wife ordered the fish and chips, it came out hot and very good. Chips were crisp, fish was battered and crisp without being oily. The portion size was large (she was unable to finish).   I had the lettuce wedge with blue cheese.  You can select either the 1/2 or full portion; I selected the the full. What arrived was a very small wedge of lettuce...I checked to make sure it was the \"full\" portion and was assured that it was.   If I had to guess, I'd say it was 1/6th of a small (not medium) head of lettuce. There was plenty of blue cheese dressing.   We had a side of slaw and a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The slaw (very good)  came out with the meal, the waiter advised us that the mashed were not ready but they were working on them. They arrived well after the balance of the food had been served and (mostly) eaten. They were hot and very good...just very late.   Over all, the service was very good (the only fault I found with service was being given the check without being asked if we wanted dessert).  The kitchen was very slow, the food portion sizes confusing and somewhat disappointing.  Confusing because the fish portions were larger than expected...the lettuce smaller than expected. The calamari? Unnecessarily poor in quality.  We ordered soft drinks, we did not order alcoholic beverage. The total with tax was $61.",

Had to pop in. This place is huge and very cool!  We sat at the bar, ordered a Hefeweizen, mojito,  veggie personal pizza and the garlic fries. Holy moly! Never had more garlicy fries, ever. I figured this was normal so we just ate and ate. Then we see the couple next to us who surprisingly ordered the same exact things..their fries were no where near as greasy or garlicy.  We ask one of the bartenders which fries are \"right\" and he says those, pointing to the couple's and that ours were beyond garlicy...What happens next? He bring out more fries, eek! Needless to say, we ate 30% of them. They were so much better than our first ones and we can't have them go to waste, right?!  The veggie pizza was great, never had one that the spinach wasn't cooked but we liked it!  The mojito was delicious and so was the large hefeweizen. Mmm!

I could tell because they kept kissing... on the side of the bar... in the middle of the bar with it being full.. it was weird. It wasn't the worst experience ever but I probably heard every single employee curse multiple times and the bartenders boyfriend just completely ruined it when one of the tables asked for a drink and he says to the bartender \"fuck them tell them we can only make them this or that...\" It's like this guy has never worked at a restaurant before and doesn't even know how to act in front of guests.

The sampler was the smarter order as our friend liked the wiezenboch and the heffenwiezen so he had four ounces of beer he liked. The service makes us want to give the food a try, but the beer makes that not likely.",

I was told we would have light appetizers but would be able to order something later if we decided to stay for the Sunday Brunch. There was no ordering later as there were Kobe sliders, egg rolls, hummus, chicken wings and garlic fries a plenty. Everything was quite good and everyone was required to take something home by our host. Very nice private room. They have live music on Sundays. It's an older crowd but the entertainment is outstanding with old school and classic R&B being performed. Get there before noon if you want a seat.",

It would ne irresponsible of me to recommend this to anyone. This establishment is far to exspensive have an extremely poor quality of food product. I will not ever return.",

    "text": "January 2011  Don't get me wrong, I love Gordon Biersch . . . their happy hour is pretty awesome, but my last  visit to this particular establishment sucked !  Pros- * awesome happy hour menu w/ cheap eats * good selection of brews (including GB home brews) * chill atmosphere with outdoor patio area  Cons- * bad service * slow service * would not accommodate our seating request * No reservations at bar. Not even for large groups!  Tips- * if you go with a large group of people, make sure to bring cash * happy hour is limited strictly to the bar area.  Sit at the bar itself for quicker service (not the surrounding tables in the bar area). * the patio is part of the bar area.  Make sure to take advantage of it.  * heat lamps are available on those colder Nevada nights. * Summerlin GBs has way better service (I'm just saying) !  Overall- I love GBs , but I don't think I'll be returning to this particular location.  The server was horrible and it was evident that she was having a bad day.  She did not smile and was frustrated the whole time because we had a larger party.  We tried to get seating near the bar for those that were under age in our party.  The server explained that it was \"closed\" and that if they wanted to join us, we'd all have to move to the dining area.  She was not helpful at all and did not even make the effort to help us.  The food was good as always and my company was great so I had a good time.  It's a disappointment that the service was subpar.",

    "text": "one of my most favorite breweries in Vegas.^^  ----Time Spent prolly 30+ visits past 4yrs.  ----LAYOUT spacious open seating built out of an old fire station's hull and complete with garage doors left from the past.   there are godzilla size beer vats at the far side of the entrance...   while not a very original layout, i think you will found it charming nonetheless.^^  ----SERVICE attentive and friendly staff...   the food delivery at the bar seem faster then on the floor.  i LOVE the menu.   although not several pages deep, i've been surprised by everything i've tasted on the menu.^^   F*CK.... where do i start.?!  my mouth starts to water as i think about the selection... LMAO.!!  for those coming to Vegas and want that UNIQUE experience in food...  both the sampler platters (Chef's Sampler/Brewer's Feast) have flavorful surprises.   i do like the rest of the appetizer menu, but the sampler platters are really where you want to start.!  main platter wise...  i've had their salads, but recommend the variety of pizzas (Pepp & Sausage) or fish (Chilean Bass - NOT Lobster Mac & Cheese - meh).   what really stands above the rest is their New York Steak & Shrimp...  very juicy... omg - so juicy.... LOLz.  my only CON with the menu is the Bistro Steak Medallions.   it was the very first thing i had at Gordon Biersch and recalled the portions small and the taste to be forgettable.  *cry*  finally, what's a Brewery without it's beers right.?   Gordon Biersch's beers were MEH to me... LOLz.   however, i NEVER go there without having at least 2 orders of my favorite Marzen.   OMG - the MARZEN is sooo good.^^   that dark drink that leaves my mouth with a smooth somber after taste.  *dies*  ----PRICING i don't recall the menu breaking the bank.   probably slightly more expensive then a trip to Outback Steakhouse.   i tend to eat a lot, so my bill averages $50 vs the $30 that i would spend at Outback...  i dunno if that'll help u gauge.  ----CLOSING if not for my discovery of Hot n Juicy Crawfish or my MOST favorite Ichiza...   Gordon Biersch use to be my favorite regular spot to hit for a place to kickback and relax.   you NEED to really try their sampler plates and the NY Steak at least once during ur Vegas visit.^^ ..... OR DIE..   jk.^^",

Served with a drizzle of sour cream, guacamole and a tomato / pepper dip.  I had the Blackened Mahi mahi sandwich and my date had the Chicken and Avocado sandwich.  Both were delicious served with garlic fries.  In some cases I have found garlic fries to be overpowering but these were lightly seasoned and delicious.  The restaurant is about 3/4 of a mile from the strip, a walk that does well to work up an appetite or work off part of a meal.  As a micro-brew fan, I look forward to trying other Gordon Biersch locations.",

    "text": "I definitely had my expectations of this place set WAY TOO HIGH.  I came here with a group of friends on a Sunday Brunch. There wasn't much of a wait for it being around 2 in the afternoon. Had a good group of people with us, and as i walk up to the hostess counter and tell her our number of people in our party, all i got was the \"really, that many\" sort of look. The roll of the eyes, the walk away unhappily before staring up and down at our entire groups' clothes, was not in the least pleasant. I'd say the two hostesses were quite rude if you ask me. It's your first priority to make the customers feel welcome the moment they walk in the door, we definitely should have left after the initial greeting, we had no idea it would be the initial horrible experience we should have foreseen at the beginning.  Our large group got the nice little back room to our selves. pretty open, quiet and enough seating for all of us and it was away from the jazz band playing during the Sunday Brunch.  It definitely felt like the restaurant was going for an older scene with the jazz band. Definitely no place for the 20 somethings that we were, walking in our pajamas and sweats after a long night of partying.  Just a bit annoying that when the door to our room was initially closed, they kept opening the door.  So maybe the 9 out of 11 of us, actually order food. Food was overall very good, decent amount of time taken to actually get our drinks, take our order, get our food and then finally get our check. So for prompt service, for the most part, i'll give you guys that. But one of my friends ordered a tomato juice. just regular plain tomato juice.  A few of us got alcoholic beverages, and got them as soon as we got our waters. but 20 minutes later, we get the tomato juice? seriously? were you guys opening up another can of tomato juice that was in the cellar down stairs, that was behind all the cartons of orange juice and milk?  The Bloody Mary I ordered had tomato juice.... couldn't get the tomato juice from the bar?  I don't know if it was just our server, but she didn't seem all quite there... So here's where I absolutely could not stand the rest of our experience.  yes, we know big groups you have to add gratuity, i get it. and thankfully that's all we gave our server for the experience.  I've worked in a restaurant and know how things work. 2 things on our bill were never accounted for. So another friend ordered a side of fruit, which we never got. So while splitting up the check i kindly asked if we can get it. first the server suggests she take it off but i said can we just get it instead. the server then suggests do you want it to-go. I agreed thinking i'd get the side of fruit in a small to go cup, and what does she walk back with.... a side of fruit in a regular bowl. so I don't get how she was the one who initiated the food to-go and we didn't even get it.... Then on top of that, while paying the bill equally among cash and credit cards, I wrote down how much should be paid on each card. wrote down amount, last name that belonged to the card, and the last 4 of the card. Pretty simplified, easy to read. One of my friends should have only had no more than $10 charged on her card. instead while preparing to sign it, she's like am i reading this right, $60?  and when i go tell our server, she said her manager was the one who charged the different cards. so you're telling me a manager doesn't know what he's doing????? Just because we're a bunch of young people who like to party cuz it's VEGAS doesn't mean you can try to take advantage of us.   WOW.  Rude Hostesses, Dimwitted Servers, and Uneducated Managers?  thanks, but no thanks. never will return to this location.  sorry.",

We were curious. Asked the waitress what she suggested. Among other things  \"Why not try the glazed chicken wings with honey and ginger?\"  \"Which beer do you recommend with it?\"  \"Try the Marzen.\"  Next, and this is the important part, is the tasting. Take a sip (or two if it pleases you) of beer, a bite through the crispy chicken wings, and another sip of beer. Note how the interaction of the chicken wing sauce pairs PERFECTLY with the beer and brings out subtle flavors and nuances that went previously un-noticed.   My friends, a fascination for beer, finger foods, and more beer begins here.  And, yes, I HAVE heard, and have experienced the sad decline of quality and consistency of GB over the years. *sigh* a painful sight to taste and watch. But, still, your Marzen and wings holds a special place in my heart, even if you do change the sauce.",

We have attended Stein Club and Passport parties as well as classes with Brewmaster Lovelady.  We loved all that.  Unfortunately, all good things apparently must come to an end.  We have noticed a decline in the quality of service, food and beer over the past year or so.  We have visited less and less because of it.  Tonight may be the last night we ever go there.  The food was terrible.  We had appetizers which were featured.  The fried onion stack tasted worse than fried onions in a can .. like they were triple dropped in the fryer.  There was no onion in there at all as far as I could tell...  the filet mignon sliders were supposed to be 2 ounces... well if they were a half an ounce that is generous.  They were tasteless and smelled like old beef.  The brats were tasteless.  The pretzel roll was probably the best thing we ate... and that's not saying much.  Even the mustard was tasteless and old tasting.  We have always loved the beer but this evening, even the beer was bad.  The Maibock was flat and tasted turned.  The Pilsner was underwhelming and also flat... far beneath our prior experience.  Happy Hour prices for beer went up and no one informed us of that.  We complained to the manager who pretended to care and do something or another on the register but when it came time to pay the bill... which took forever to get.... nothing had been done to compensate us for the terrible service, terrible beer and terrible food.  It was abysmal in every possible way.  We have always been good customers and good tippers.  They have lost good customers tonight.  If this was the first time, we might have ignored one bad experience but, this has been a long time coming over the past year or so.  Sorry.  No more.  Or No Mas.",

Because I work a mile away, this is probably the 50th time I've had HH here but this is my first post - mostly because I always have too much fun at HH and always have a good experience, so the need to review slips my mind.  But finally, I am reviewing the place that has probably been able to pay their electric bills from my tabs.  Here's the real deal.  ONLY GO HERE FOR HAPPY HOUR!!  The HH is from 3-6pm (and from 10pm to close) and has great food specials.  Yesterday I had the Baja Tacos with a $7 happy hour price and it was the best $7 I have spent in years.  You get 4 fish tacos for the price and they were delicious!  The brews are $1 off, which isn't the best deal in town, but their HH food specials make up for the low beer discounts.  You can't go wrong with the garlic fries and the southwest egg rolls - ORDER THEM!!  They have space for merging tables for larger groups and have plenty of TV's for all the sports watching.  From a reviewer who has been here about 50 times, the 5th star is missing only because the service has been mediocre most of the time - sometimes because the happy hour is understaffed.  But once the beer and food arrive, it's definitely a 4-star place!",
