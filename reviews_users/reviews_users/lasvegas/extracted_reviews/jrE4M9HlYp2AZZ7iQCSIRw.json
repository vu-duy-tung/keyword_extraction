    "text": "This restaurant had a rather high rating which I thought would impress my asian elders on our recent trip to Vegas.     I've been here in the late hours to eat peking duck which wasn't bad, but wasn't great.     Then I decided to bring a party of 17 to this restaurant for dim sum on Sunday and made reservations.     I was asked why I chose this place as everyone was disappointed that the food was not that great.     It's hard to explain, but it's just hmm...  Service was good.   But the food just didn't seem up to par.   Was it bad?   Not really... but it wasn't good.     The place we used to go to on decataur which tends to change ownership or names every time we visit (yearly or longer) that I thought I would check this out.     The other place had poor selection of dim sum vs. this place, but the food was tastier, hot, etc.   Here is was just... average.  So I hope the rating drops below the 4 stars because this is not above average and while I would go there again... I must protest their dim sum is not the best and what's funny is that the elders I brought would have rather gone to the restaurant with less selection and packed.  I rather enjoyed not having to fight to get food, but oh well... relaying the message of the party of 17 so that Yelp gives a better or accurate score.    (Yes, you have to assume that I know what I'm talking about :^P)",

Came in around 1pm or so and all the plates I ordered were cold, not even warm!  They couldn't even cut the shrimp or crab balls or the rice rolled with shrimp with soy sauce over and they didn't even have sweet and sour sauce for the shrimp balls, instead they gave me a glob of mayo. Gross!  I would automatically assume they would cut the shrimp balls for you like any other dim sum places I've been.  And the pieces were all fairly small.  I don't think I enjoyed any of the plates, not even the ha cao and that's my favorite from every dim sum! Maybe the shiu mai a tad bit but that's about it.  Worst dim sum experience I've ever had despite the fact that it's in Vegas!",

I don't know if they have something against Filipinos, but three groups of Filipinos have walked out since we sat here.  Yes, I am here at the restaurant writing this review.  Why?  Because we have been waiting for our dimsum for 20 minutes now.  I am doing this review to kill time.  When we got here, we were never handed the menu.  BUT, the other two groups who came in after us, were handed their menus AND GIVEN SUPER VIP TREATMENT.  They gave their drinks right away and their menus.  When we flagged down the person (with glasses) at the front reception area who sat us down (since no one was around to help us) to ask for menus, he dropped the menus on our table as if we were a big inconvenience to him.  Same for when he dropped off the food we ordered...he dropped it on our table like he was forced to work today or not getting paid to work here. Also, while writing this, three groups of Filipino have walked out of the restaurant because of their service.  SO, if you are craving for Chinese food...DO NOT COME HERE!!!  Service is terrible!!!!  Avoid this place!!! Go somewhere else where it is worth to pay your hard earned money for food and service.",

It was 100+ degrees outside....and 80-something inside.  Don't know if the A/C was on, but it was hot inside too!  The restaurant wasn't very well lit, and the place seemed like it would be dirty, but not dirty enough where you're grossed out by it.    Anyways, the wait staff was friendly (engaging in small talk with Melly Mel's mom) and offered suggestions while we were ordering.  Food came out super quick - not fast like a typical Chinese restaurant, but SUPER QUICK, like the dealers-taking-your-money-quick at the casinos down the street!   Things of note:   * Peking Spareribs were good, but a little sour due to them using a little more vinegar in their sauce than what I am used to. * Orange Chicken...yeah, just don't order it.  All white meat, but not good enough I'd order a 2nd time.  Would totally come back......but not for their Orange Chicken.",

    "text": "I came here on a Sunday morning and the line was out the door. I looked over at Sam Woos, and the placed looked like it was closed even though the open sign was lit up. So I decided the food is probably going to be better over here judging by the crowd.   I went up the front, and waited about 5 minutes and never got acknowledged. I was just trying to get a number to get seated. A Chinese couple came up and spoke in cantonese and they were given seating numbers immediately. So I decided to interrupt and ask for a number as well. The asian lady gave me a dirty look, and the Chinese couple were nice enough to say that I was ahead of them and I deserve a number ahead of them. The asian lady refused and still gave me the later number. As I was walking away I heard .. \" he jus stan der like a wood, no say nuthin so no numba!\"     Hmm so I guess customer service is not exactly their forte here. Since its my last meal in Vegas, and I have been meaning to try some great off the strip Dim Sum, I just had to deal with it.   I was finally seated about 20 minutes later. The dim sum came at us hot and heavy. I was able to get all of my orange county favorites. The taste however was just as not as good as Seafood paradise in Little Saigon, but I would say its better then Cathays in Vegas.  The price of the food is definitely very reasonable. However the tip they earned was not so much. I expect at least to be acknowledged when I want to pay for service next time.   I have dined at Sam Woos and Shang Hais in the same shopping center, but as far as Chinese food goes, this is the most authentic out of them all. I would come here for the food, get abused a little bit then leave with a full stomach and a stink eye at everyone you see in this place.",

    "text": "Dont eat here!! Horrible service, bad attitudes, and gross food!!  Definitely not a fan. The Service was pretty bad. I actually thought the egg rolls were pretty good, but then things got worse again.  My wife ordered a dish, after talking with the waitress about what was good.  Keep in mind we do a lot of eating out Chinese, and this time was our first time here ,so kept it safe with some basic dishes we knew (or so we thought) would be good or hard to mess up.  I'm also easy to please I literally eat almost anything and there's not much I dont like!  Anyway...........   First of all we had a longer than normal wait for the food, and then when the waitress came with the dish, it wasnt what we expected.  We nicely and calmly explained to her, thats not what we wanted so could we exchange it for something else?  She gave us an attitude and went to get the manager.  She came back and didnt say anything to us, passed our table several times, and went  to check on other customers!  After about 10 mins she FINALLY comes back over (after the food got cold) and said Sorry you have to just eat that, as she passed by our table not even looking at us!!   I was pretty furious not only with her answer but the treatment and attitude she had been giving us all night!!  I was surprised my wife kept cool, because she doesnt put up with much in restuarants.  But we just said ok and went ahead and ate it anyway.    The food was way too sweet, i felt like i was eating dessert already.  It had a strong flour taste, and just plain wierd!  Then to top it off, the waitress didnt come back to check on us, or say anything the whole time, until we were leaving.  She brought the check, and packaged our food in a take out box.  We said to ourselves she certainly wouldnt get a tip, and then we paid and left.  Definitely wont be returning here!!     Dont waste your time or money!!",

    "text": "We come here almost every year when we make our annual trip for a basketball tournament. They advertise that they have dim sum everyday, but we always go for dinner. Restaurant hours are certainly accommodating to late-night gamblers: 10 AM - 5 AM. They have a couple of separate banquet rooms which can accommodate large groups -- hopefully you won't need one at the same time a tour bus pulls in.  On our latest trip, we had: fish fillet with black bean sauce, string beans with minced meat, shrimp w/ lobster sauce, deep fried salted & spicy squid, the house special chow mein, orange peel chicken, and eggplant w/ garlic sauce hotpot.  The good: the string beans were fresh & crisp, and the eggplant hotpot was very tasty. The Hong Kong-style chow mein was very good as well.  The bad: fried squid was unremarkable and the chicken in the orange peel chicken was tough & chewy.  The ugly: the fish fillet w/ black bean sauce & the shrimp w/ lobster sauce both had way too much brown/white onion. The shrimp w/ lobster sauce had only six shrimp, and the lobster sauce had pieces of pork, which is something I haven't seen before. The flavor for both dishes was good, but just not enough fish or shrimp in each.  Overall, the food is probably pretty good for Las Vegas as far as being authentically Chinese, but the quality of some dishes isn't as good as you'd find in a community with a large Chinese population (i.e., LA or SF).",

The guy asked us what we wanted to drink I requested for durian shake since they have it on the menu but he told me they don't have, he try to get me order Thai tea, I then try to order the mix fruit tea jar, he then proceeded to get another lady over who then told me that isn't a cold tea but it is a hot tea then proceeded to point to the Thai tea again . In the end I settle with hot tea & ice water. We ordered bitter Mellon with pork rib, super seafood with tofu soup, fried tofu with seafood and sizzling beef hot plate. it was decent but I wouldn't get the fried tofu with seafood again since it tasted bland and got too many broccoli in the dishes as well. There were hardly any seafood in the dish and what I thought was small small to non existing size scallops tastes like fish paste. I didn't find any shrimp in that dishes either and for a moment I thought this is a vegetarian dish.  As for the soup there were lots and lots of tofus, carrots and maybe there are couple of cut up shrimp in the soup basically this could be another vegetarian dish. Overall if you are a meat eater, skip those two dishes but if you are vegetarian, those dishes would be great. The dinner cost about 55$ total for the two of us with some left over food to take home .   For those reviews who complain about the dated decors and run down place, I agreed but I am not there for the place , I am mainly there for the food so the surrounding shabby decors doesn't bother me and beside it is Asian restaurant so I don't expected much",

    "text": "I had no expectations coming in here as the reviews were pretty low. Harbor Palace is actually home to some pretty decent dim sum. But keep in mind this is coming from a Dallas born-and-raised gal where we do not have great dim sum. My group and I came here around 1pm on Sunday and there was no wait. There were a decent amount of carts rolling around with your typical dim sum dishes. The chili oil was oddly really good. We got the dim sum must-orders: har gow, shu mai, shrimp fun roll, and fried taro. All were delicious and flavorful. We ordered the two different types of tripe and were left pretty underwhelmed. The flavors were lacking and definitely needed the chili oil and soy sauce to amp things up. My group liked the chicken feet. I eat pretty weird things but chicken feet is something I never touch. The radish cake was also tasty. Overall, I liked and enjoyed the dim sum here. Unfortunately it took forever for us to get the check. The service is kinda spotty with but what Asian restaurant actually has good service?",

The next time I meet up with her in NYC, I am bringing her straight to Flushing or Chinatown so that she can compare the difference. Despite the service being prompt and friendly, the quality of the dim sum just could not meet my expectations. The zha liang was not crispy and the sauce for the Xia Chang Fen was pouring more fluidly than our tea. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad. I enjoyed the meal and it did not break the bank. However, if you truly want to experience great dim sum, travel out of Las Vegas.",

Abalone, shark fin, geoduck clams, lobster, crab, they got it!    I will beat you, however, if you order the honey walnut shrimp.  Picture Long John Silver's fried shrimp topped with room-temperature, Kroger mayonnaise.  Yep, that's their \"famous\" honey walnut shrimp! I'm still hunting down the person that recommended it to me.    Also, be warned that their waitstaff may or may not mistreat you.  I personally enjoy rude Chinese restaurant waitstaff but you may not.  They get three stars  simply because their staff are extra grumpy.  Really, I love brusque waiters.  P.S. - If you're a glutton for punishment, get their frequent diner card.  You'll get coupons for free food (I guess, if you want it...).",

We ordered the fish fillet and my husband bit into something hard that can only be described as rock-like. To top off the disappointing meal, the service was horrible because we had to ask multiple times for everything from our waters to a clean spoon. At the end of our disastrous meal we got handed a $90 bill for food that we didn't even really eat. I begrudgingly paid the $90 and chose not to leave a tip because of the lackluster service and the fact that the manager/owner completely ignored our comments about the quality of food, and after all of that the waitress had the nerve to ask me where her tip was. Needless to say we will never be coming back!",

    "text": "Been here a couple times as I was starving and really would really not go back if I could help it just because their decor is unpleasant and they were out of egg tarts by 12:30 and did not have any beef balls! Both times the same cart lady completely avoided me altogether! I even called her and another cart lady had to tell her to come over; twice in two separate visits after going round and round seemed like too much of a coincidence. The place is poorly lit, not ideal for cart traffic and just grungy in general. I only like their beef roll, leaf wrapped rice and their baked custard buns which are my favorite nice and hot. Their steamed BBQ buns are not very good but their Har Gow was huge and decent.",

We had made a reservation for 20 people after my cousin's wedding, they only sat down 1/3 of us and gave other tables to other people. Once my group finally sat down 20 minutes later, my table of 9 waited 20 minutes to put in our order (we couldn't catch the waitress because she kept running around and wouldn't listen to us) and then we waited 1 hour to get our food. We were so hungry, we finished our 6 plates of food in 15 minutes. What a lame way to spend our post-wedding dinner! So sad haha. The busser was more on top of it than our waitress. 6 out of 9 spoons we were given had visible food stains--when we asked out waitress for new ones, she seemed confused and in disbelief. Everyone else around us got their food well before us, even though they sat down after us. When we asked our waitress where our food was and if we could talk to a manager, she shook her head and mumbled something and ran away from our table. We asked another passing waiter the same thing, to which he laughed nervously and said \"No manager\" and also ran away. Not sure if he meant \"No I'm not letting you talk to my manager\" or \"No there is no manager here, you fools.\" Which it would be easy to believe that there was no manager because clearly this place was unmanaged and poorly run.  Don't waste your time with this place, the food was good but the service makes it completely not worth it. I'm the LEAST picky/bourgeois person and this place was so ridiculously awful I had to leave this review.",

    "text": "More like a 3.5. Honestly, I left happy with my meal. I wasn't expecting much since I have had dim sum all my life and this place is in Nevada. The fact that it is located in Chinatown was a little concerning since I tend to think overrated and Chinatown, but this strip on Chinatown was crazy jam packed with Asian restaurants. The decor is very typical dim sum restaurant and is also very typical Chinese service. FYI, the bathroom is not good, so if you can hold off, you should.  The food:  Churn Fun with Shrimp- The crepe was more thick noodle like but still had good flavor. It was good.  Churn Fun with Spare Ribs- Similar to the above but I was expecting the spare ribs to be more tender. The flavor was good.  Pie Kwat- This spare rib is the same as the above, good flavor but needed to be more tender.  Don Tot- I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of the egg tart, this is a must get.  Sesame Ball with Lotus Paste- I never get this but a member of my group ordering it and it was great. The outer dough had a perfect chew and the lotus paste had a nice sweetness and nice smooth consistency. Highly recommend.  Bell Pepper with Shrimp Paste- It was good but not a terribly exciting dish.  Dow Meow- or Snow Pea Leaf for $15.95. I really liked the flavor, it is pricey but this is the same price as New York but it was flavorful and tender. I would get this again.   Pork Congee with Thousand Year Egg- It was respectable, the flavor is subtle but the pork and egg adds nice flavor.  Braised Tofu Skin- These seemed on the small side but the flavor was decent.  Shumai- This was bad, it was dry and grainy, I would totally skip this. This was the only thing that I really didn't like, everything else was good or really good.",

There wasn't much variety after looking at 4-5 different carts that's all they had to offer. The siu mei and the chicken feet were the highlights everything else was bland and not exactly worth the meal . Go save your stomache for one of the places to eat at in the malls or try out ping pang pong down the road for better dim sum.  Though for some reason the place was filling up pretty quick i'm assuming is because of that sign thats posted listing off all of the restuarants and what they have to serve. I guess its a plus that they serve until 5am on weekends.",

I love it because all you have to do is point and they serve it to you. It helps that I speak Cantonese, so I was able to request my favorite, but I can see how this would be frustrating to others who are not familiar with Dim Sum.   Yes, they do have chicken feet.  Unless you can read Chinese, chances are you won't be able to read the check and know exactly how much it will cost you, or know the actual name of the item that you ordered. Meh.  Sometime's I'd rather not know.   I thought this was a great place for Dim Sum, but it certainly is not a good place for Dim Sum beginners without an old Chinese person or a seasoned Dim Sum eater.",

    "text": "Was craving some dim sum so went for dim sum on a Sunday after noon around 130pm.  I'm from Maryland so we have some decent  dimsum I'm places. This is probably not as good as back in maryland. If u could I would give it 2.5 stars. They have dim sum on carts. We tried the typical dim sum foods. We had har gow, siu mai, chiu chow fun gwor, rice wrapped in banana leaf, shrimp crepes (), spare ribs, shrimp balls...The best things to get here was the fried shrimp balls, spare rib, siu mai, and rice wrapped in banana leaf. The rest was so so. The biggest disappointment was the har gow. The thin was too thick. Should be crystal like and shrimp flavorful. There was no flavor. Service wasn't bad. Restaurant wasn't too busy so the carts came around quite often. Had to ask for water refills though.",

They exchanged it for a new one so we carried on with our lunch. But then, my dad bit into his sesame ball..... and his cap (tooth) came out! He bit onto something very hard, possibly a bone, something that should not have been in there. It took forever to get the manager to come to the table. She then said it was not a real tooth so it wasn't their fault and that my dad needs to be more carful when eating sticky foods. No apologies. No attempt to resolve anything. Very rude and argumentative. After much resistance she comped our meal. Unacceptable customer service! Poor food.",

First the waiter got mad when we told him it was a party of 12 and they did not want to join the tables which we said we didnt mind them being seperate. Then we are ready to order our drinks and they were not waiting for everyone to order so they kept coming back and forth and what trully ruined the night was the last thing they did. THEY ARE VERY RUDE . I was ordering the entrees and asked how the dinner special worked and told them to give me a second since i was translating for my in law. She said i cant wait for you ,now you wait for me and i said ok. Made sure the whole table new what they wanted and when i said excuse me we are ready this time, she completely went passed us and ignored my party so we left. Then she went outside and thought we can come back inside and since she was ready for us but Like really you had one other table aside from us . DONT TELL ME YOU WERE BUSY! unless you are patient dont  go here. I cant tell you if the food was at all good because we didnt make it that far.",

    "text": "Harbor Palace serves up average dim sum with a few above average items. The har gow was above average, while the 1K year old egg and pork porridge was bland and tasteless. Other items including the char siu bao and spareribs in black bean were acceptable and average.  The decor was a bit of fusion between Southern China and Vietnamese dive. Plenty of neon signs all plugged into few outlets which left me eyeing the emergency exits in case of electrical fire. I spied a couple of them moving waterfall art on one wall, which amused me with its tackiness and plebian charm.  Prices for the dinner menu are on the high side, but that seems par for the course for LV chinese food. You won't find those family meal deals available at 99% of the California chinese dives.  Service is standard dim sum which means little to no attention. No surprises here. At least you can tip 10% without any guilt whatsoever.  I have a feeling this place is the only game in town for acceptable dim sum, smack dab in the middle of Chinatown. Please prove me wrong!",

They said they have it but when we ordered it they say not available. We ended up not odering anything and just paid for the Dim Sum we ordered and left.

They have all of the usual dim sum dishes and some that I don't see at the other dim sum restaurants we've tried. The dim sum is delicious and consistent. The ladies that go around with the carts are mostly friendly but some are serious and mean business lol. The two supervisor ladies are friendly with us. I took a star off because of the building itself. Right when you enter the glass doors are dirty with what looks like oily finger prints. The other things that keeps me from giving a 5 star is that they do not proactively refill water. Then when you ask for water it takes a while to get to the table.   Even with these cons my family returns to Harbor Palace because of delicious dim sum.",

Nobody wanted to get us the bill, when we finally got someone's attention we were told it wasn't her responsibility.

Kept throwing food on our table that we didn't want, at one point they asked if we wanted beef belly and we told them no because my husband is deathly allergic to it, can't even touch it & they left it on our table and walked away. When it came down to the bill they charged us for that, charged us an item three times and charged another item twice. This resulted in no tip from us to which she grabbed the receipt as we were getting up and basically yelled \"no tip??\" loud enough that three tables turned around to look. Like no, you don't get a tip, maybe listen when we say we can't have certain items within reach of someone because they're deathly allergic & then charge us for it.",

The sat us at a table by the entrance, so while we were eating people were standing by us waiting and just looking which is SUPER awkward. The tea cup and spoons were not washed thoroughly. They had some weird stuff on them. They were also hosting a party in one of their side rooms which is annoying because they reserved the room on a really busy night. Which meant that they got to enjoy themselves and not really have to wait when everyone else were crammed in the main room.  I would have given this place two stars, but I understand that it was super busy and that they were doing their best. I felt bad for one of the service people because she was kind of old and she was running back and forth trying to service everyone.  The food was ok for me but my parents love how the food taste, but they don't really know how to eat.",

The siu may tasted old and disgusting; the shrimp dumpling was slightly better, but not much to care for; the spare rib pork on top of rice noodle (huh?) was tasteless and so was the BBQ pork in rice noodle dish; congee also had no flavor; har gow was just lukewarm and tasted just ok.  The best thing we had was the egg custard pastry.  I won't come back here for dim sum ever.",

So we got a few items from the cart, typical dim sum stuff, and it wasn't a good sign when we all said, 'that's shumai???'  We ended up finishing what I think was 6 plates worth of stuff, got the bill and saw that it was pretty pricey for dim sum.  We were still hungry afterwards and ended up at Lee's Sandwiches at the next plaza over.  Definitely wouldn't recommend this place and not too sure there are many other dim sum options in Vegas.",

It is a utilitarian dim sum place that is located in close proximity to the strip and lacks immediate competition. We had brunch here on a Sunday and the food was actually okay. Although I thought the dumplings could have been much better and the shaomai was just okay, I enjoyed the Chinese broccoli, char siu baau, and shrimp har gao.   Our servers were very friendly and the place was totally packed (with Chinese people) when we were there. My only complaint was that the servers with carts were really trying to push as many dishes on us as possible.   I would definitely go back, and I'm still trying to figure out where all the 1-star reviews are coming from....the food was okay-to-good and the price was very cheap.

    "text": "Un-be-lievable!  We should have stuck to our gut instincts and said \"no\" to trying out another dim sum place, other than our usual, Orchids Garden.  We should have also read all of the Yelp reviews on this place before entering their restaurant.  What a mistake we made!  Never before have I asked my family to ditch a restaurant the moment we got seated...until this day!  Walking in, my family didn't get greeted by the host upfront with his head buried in a newspaper.  No.  Instead, it felt as though we had disturbed him.  It took him a while to muster up a \"how many?\" before he removed himself from his seat to sit us at a table.  STRIKE ONE.  Next, we asked our server if they had dim sum.  To which she rudely replied, \"Dim sum, no order!\" seeing we had their menu before us.  Okayyyy.  Understandably, we weren't going to order dim sum from their menu, as we are accustomed to ordering from CARTS!  She walked away and returned with a paper menu of dim sum items and a pencil and dropped them at our table; no explanation.  Weird, so I assume, we DO have to ORDER, as we see no cart in sight anyway.  STRIKE TWO!  We finally get to writing down our list of dim sum items we would like.  We then proceed to asking her for two more settings for our table of four (we were seated on a table set for two).  Without a word, she turned around and grabbed two settings from an open table.  As she began to \"place\" them on our table, she pushed past my two young children reaching over them, resulting in her \"thrusting\" the fork and knife toward my husband as he was writing.  Really, woman?  She basically poked his hand with a fork tine, never excused herself for it, and simply walked away.  RUDE!  STRIKE THREE!!!  At that point, I asked my husband if we could leave.  So upsetting!  As I walked past the server, who then realized we were walking out, I pointed at her and scolded her with a \"YOU NEED TO BE NICER!\"  Then we left.  Now, I apologize in advance if I offend, I have no intention of it.  But, seriously?  At some Chinese restaurants, you are commonly accustomed to experience a kind of abrupt, hurried kind of service that is typical of their customary practice.  I should know.  I'm Chinese myself.  So, I'm not being overly sensitive of the situation at Harbor Palace that night.  I know what to typically expect, or not expect.  But, this???  The customer service at Harbor Palace should not be experienced by any paying patron, no matter what!  (I should say, the lack of customer service).  They have no common sense of decency when it comes to working with people.  In fact, I believe that because they are \"fed\" their business via tour buses (don't ask me how or why it is that way), they feel the need to not offer good, if any, customer service.  We are NEVER returning to this place again.  They are disgusting.",

The staff is rude, aloof, and have an uncaring attitude about their customers. I shouldn't be surprised as the mom and pop owners are even worse. If you are Caucasian,  they can see you over and over and still act like they don't know you, crabby demeanor that makes you feel very unwelcome The food, atmosphere, and cleanliness have deteriorated as well. They seem only to want to welcome and cater to the big busloads of Asian tourists who arrive as part of their travel package itinerary. Fed up with it all and won't take it anymore.",

The next day when it was time to eat again, there was no way that we were gonna do any buffet!  Had to look for something to take out, and something light for my loved one, so off I went to the little Chinatown area on Spring Mountain Road.........I found this rather large Chinese restaurant called - Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant.  In I walked, and the first thing I asked them is if they sold juk (Chinese porridge)?  Lucky for me this was our savoir! I was able to get the juk that I wanted for my loved one, it was rather expensive, but when you need it, you need it!  This place offered seven types of juk -  1. Frog Leg Porridge  -  $19.00 for Large 2. Seafood Porridge - $17.00 for Large 3. Fish Porridge - $17.00 for Large 4. Fisherman Porridge - $17.00 for Large 5. Pork Porridge - $12.00 for Large 6. Chicken Porridge - $12.00 for Large 7. Beef Porridge - $12.00 for Large  I ended up ordering the Fish Porridge...........it was the perfect thing to have, when you have a loved one ailing from a queezy stomach.",

My family and I didn't really have a problem with the servers, it was really the food that was quite lackluster.  We ordered dim sum (I want to give an extra star for the fact that they serve dim sum for dinner, but I just can't) off of an already used dim sum order form. We got the siu mai, har gau, shrimp balls and salt & pepper squid. The salt & pepper squid was basically fried squid flavored rings of batter. It was like eating hard squid chips. And that was so disappointing because my family loves well made salt and pepper squid. The siu mai had an odd aftertaste. The only dim sum I thought was okay was the har gau.   A lot of their condiments (soy sauce and chili oil) resided in dirty containers, so we were afraid to use them because they seemed old. The chili oil looked to be more oil or some other liquid than chili, which was kinda gross.   There's also no refills on drinks.  Safe to say that we're never eating here again.",

This place is regularly open til 5AM, which further begs the question: how I have I not been here before?!  Late night dim sum menu is about 15 items, we sampled quite a few. Steamed pork buns were solid, pork shumai were tasty, shrimp balls were fresh, beef tripe was not my bag, and the noodle in the spare rib rolled noodle dish had an odd flowery aftertaste.   Overall, flavors were solid and pricing was fair. Service was nonexistent despite 4 employees walking around. Orchid Garden is my usual go-to spot for gut-busting amounts of dim sum, and it sort of works in Harbor Palace's favor that they have a limited menu: I can come by more often without completely throwing my health goals out the window!",

Food took forever to come out and the complimentary tea was warm. I've had a lot of chinese food and they have by far the most bland tasting food ever. They use ginger in every dish so it all tastes the same. I had to dip everything in soysauce (which I had to walk up and get myself) just to have some flavor.

We were able to get the pork baos, siumai, and shrimp dumplings.  The dim sum was good, but it is much back back in Cali. We ordered some congee, but it was nasty, it was runny and had no flavor.  The highlight of the experience was the service.  We had a nice server who kept checking on us and always had a smile.  In a Chinese restaurant that can be hard to come by.

It didn't take long and within minutes our order served one by one - so glad cz we we were starving! Food was good and surprised to say that this time around, service was decent. It must be because the place is not that packed. Our servers were fast to request for water refills, etc - place overall decently clean/presentable. The man who initially took our order actually came back towards the end to ask if everything wz ok ... that never happened before in any of our previous visits. Again, maybe because it wasn't as packed, but hopefully it stays that way. We'll come back again to enjoy good food ... next time we'll order \"duck\".",

I will list the foods (some with my patented terrible description) that i liked and didn't like:  Likes: -chicken feet - i like to eat these things, but i think it's cooler to watch other peoples' grossed-out expressions when i do eat them -smelt - surprisingly flavorful -spare rib - tender and tasty -shrimp dumpling - basic but good -the flat thing that tasted like shrimp and looked like an egg, also good  Drinking haterade: -all egg rolls were bland and blech -calamari just ok -the steam rolls i had were kinda cold and blech -other dumplings we ordered (not shrimp), take a pass  So some good and not so good things here, thus my useless 3 star rating.  I will continue my vegas dim sum search to other places, though i may come back here.",

He's usually there late in the afternoon to late night. He showed me where my table is without giving the menu. I waited for it and nothing. I stood up and walked back in front and asked for it politely, he was writing something and did not even say anything or looked at me, when i was asking him the menu. I walked away thinking that maybe he was just really busy, then when i was already seated, he said Hey! Here's the menu, without moving his feet and trying to say, come here and get it! So stupid! Then i actually realized that he really did ignored me face to face when i approached him about the menu in the first place. And because of that, I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT EVER AGAIN! RESPECT YOUR CUSTOMERS! CUSTOMERS EXPECT SERVICE! GOOD SERVICE!!! THAT IS WHERE YOUR TIPS COME FROM!!! WE PAY FOR IT!!! I STILL PAID FOR IT!!!  I will not hesitate anymore to drive to the next block to go to ORCHIDS! Tourist come here because this is the one in the main Chinatown block and because they didn't know about the other ones around. Maybe now i know why there's more customers at Orchids. I am not connected with Orchids, i just had the oppurtunity to compare the two big ones. and i am just a of dimsums. So customer, do your research first. You can always feel full after you eat, but don't you think it's much better when you feel full and feel good after you eat?!!!",

We came here on our visit to Las Vegas and decided to take a gamble on this place. Unfortunately, the house won the bet and we lost.   Let's talk about service, or the lack of service. Every time we requested something from the waiter/waitress, we had to ask two or three times.   \"Miss, can we have some water?\"  \"Excuse me, can we have some water?\"  \"Hello? We asked for some water earlier -- can we have some water?\"   Maybe they didn't want us to get full from drinking, but I sounded like a broken record. When we finally got the water, the waitress didn't apologize or seem sorry that her service sucked!   On to the food --- this was some gross Dim Sum. The har-gow was blah - the chow fun was stick and nasty - the fried rice tasted like crap.   Nothing good here!",

The standard dim sum fare ( served on carts ) but the gf thought the selection was limited and nothing unique ( i agree on the uniqueness but i was ok with the selection )   the price is also a little higher than the other places ( $39 bill for the 2 of us - that's the most we've paid for a dim sum meal ) but i was so appreciated of the food being well prepared, hot and fresh.",

At first impression when walking into the restaurant the ambience felt unclean, but when checking SNHD websites they got an A grade. So we still decided to order.   Ordered tons of food, but the only thing that was memorable was the roast duck and the deep fried Chicken.  Everything else was either gross or off taste to what I am used to from a Cantonese flavor stand point.    What got me was they charge on the steam rice and extra bun for the duck.   At the end I realize there where no free bowl of soup, which was odd since we made a huge order and no oranges or desert at the end of the meal.    I guess I needed the reminder of why I didnt come back and now I can remind myself in the next four years when I read what I wrote.   I'm glad I gave them two chances before writing this so I know it wasn't just a one time decision and I will return to my regular place for dinner at KJ kitchen and ordchid garden for dim sum where majority of locals go and eat.",

    "text": "Had dinner with family here on Monday (11/19/18) during our Las Vegas trip. - parking: plenty since it is located inside a plaza. - table: we got our table immediately since there was no customer when we walked in around 7 PM. - We had ordered:       -Sauteed Fillet Rock Cod with Pepper and Black Bean Sauce ($11.95 + tax): tasted OK, wished we had a little more fishes than onions.       -Roast Duck (Half $11.50 + tax): tasted OK, wished it was a little warmer.       -Deep Fried Crispy Chicken (Half $9.95 + tax): tasted terrible, the chicken was so dried, the skin wasn't crispy at all. We could eat only a couple of pieces. We should have not ordered this dish :(.       -Crabmeat and Dried Scallop Fried Rice ($12.95 + tax): tasted good, wished it had a little more Crabmeat ( we found a few small pieces), and scallop (we could not find any scallop) :(.       -steam rice -Billing: they charged us almost 75 bucks for all mentioned items listing above. Turned out they charged us extra 22 bucks plus for an additional beef dish which we DID NOT order. When we asked them to fix it, they did not even say 'sorry' for their mistake. To all folks whom is/are going to dine here, please MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR RECEIPT BEFORE PAYING!!! -inside: very roomy. -washing room: not that clean.",

Don't ever try the crab claw. They will try hard to suggest it because $9 for 2 claws. Pounded in batter, old fishy taste and smell. When I try to tell them the crab is not fresh in return the owner give me an education how it was made. There's an very nice young server there kinda feel bad and try to get it off my bill. I told her I pay for it since I don't want her to get in trouble. The owner did not take care of it in the first place. The bill is $42 and I left $9 tips for the server because she went beyond her position in there. Please stay away. Landon",

    "text": "Ah I'm sorry but I have to give this place low marks. The food is, by far, the worst dim sum place I've ever had.   I wouldn't consider myself a connoisseur of dim sum by any means, but I've had my fair share of good and bad places. Although we came during peak hours (they had a decent amount of customers), the food tasted stale and hard. Many of the items we ordered seemed like they were sitting out for a while. So, perhaps they'd consider not making so much food until there's actually demand for it.  I'm not one to typically mind a dingy and dirty place (see my other reviews). But food quality should make up for that. In this case, it didn't. One look inside one of their dim sum carts and it'd be enough to make you stop what you're eating switch to tea.",

Came again yesterday, busy Sunday around noon and basically got ignored by numerous wait staff when asked for water and a fork. No offer for hot tea which is unusual for a Chinese restaurant. Dumplings were cold like they have been sitting out on the cart too long.There were about 3 dimsum carts being pushed around with limited choices.  Only 1 waitress was kind enough to get us what we requested. Basically we felt ignored and invisible. Maybe it would have helped if we were Chinese and spoke Chinese !",

We didn't know until the bill came, so I wished they had a way of marking the prices of their dim sum plates on the carts. Another shrimp plate I ordered on the dim sum cart was $7 too, so that was a bummer.   We got the spareribs and eggplant hot pot. It came with very little rice for the two of us to share. How do you eat hot pot with so little rice? Most other restaurants will give a large pot of rice to your table if you order a dinner size entree.   In looking at the other reviews, I see most people say the food is good, but the service is bad. My experience was the opposite. The service was fine and I had no problem getting food in a fast and friendly manner, but to me, the food is only mediocre.",

    "text": "The ONE star rating this place earned is for the non-smoking atmosphere.  And that's it!!  The bench seat was missing the back half (where your butt & tailbone would touch) of the padding, so the seat was lumpy and had a steep decline.  VERY UNCOMFORTABLE!!  I had to go to my car to get a blanket, roll it up lengthwise, and fill in the crevice so we could eat comfortably.  The ONLY reason why I didn't just get up & leave, which I would have done had it been with other company, was that my 73-year-old aunt wanted to eat here & out of respect, I didn't complain to her.  (I waited to do it here)  Plus she paid.  That was the first bad experience.  The second came when we were greeted at the table rather blankly by our waitress.  Maybe she was having a bad day, maybe that was her personality, whatever; still didn't make my experience any better.  Yes, my aunt has a strong accent, but the waitress couldn't figure out what exactly she wanted even after I tried to explain (I have a North American accent & spoke slowly & articulated my words).  I think my aunt got the food she wanted.  3rd bad experience:  The crab rangoon had curry in it!!  I made crab rangoon before & could have sworn it doesn't have curry in it.  The waitress looked at us through slitted eyes & said that's how they normally make it (curry was not mentioned in the menu).  So I double checked a few websites, and sure enough, NO CURRY in a traditional crab rangoon recipe!  I looked at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fallrecipes.com&s=59bcd58e2f8d0b8ee07469cd050304a052648c62d30b661142f176e748f3caae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">allrecipes.com</a>, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchinesefood.about.com&s=8bcbb17d191f0871392f6b8fb52f0e465a162925ef85b73df5ec54b82b207ee9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chinesefood.about.com</a>, and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdamndelicious.net&s=958dc339910a78700713e8e07bb77ba2de7d1a902d68d02f928fc84ad4be6e35\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">damndelicious.net</a>.  My sister told them to take it back, that we didn't want it.  Since our aunt paid the bill, we didn't get to see it (actually forgot to check) to make sure the 2 orders of crab rangoon was taken off the bill.  I hope so.  4th bad experience:  Waited A LLLOOOONG time, each time, to get checked on and for a water refill.  This is even before the crab rangoon incident.  Can't blame it on revengeful, horrendous service.  5th bad experience:  The breaded shrimp is WAY TOO BREADED!!!  When we removed the breading, it almost tripled the size of the shrimp that was lost inside.  6th bad experience:  Price for and taste of food were at opposite ends of the spectrum!!  Guess which ends they belong?  I don't eat at McDonald's anymore, but I know McDonald's food tastes A LOT BETTER!  Needless to say, we will NOT return.  I'm noticing a few one-star reviews to my right as I write this.  I'll steer my auntie somewhere else next time we visit her.  And my sister or I will pay!   THIS IS THE **WORST** RESTAURANT MY SISTER AND I HAVE VISITED!!!!!!!  Actually, I'll read my other posts after posting this and remove the previous statement if I see that I've experienced worse.  If you're still reading this, though, consider yourself warned.  Just so y'all know, I read my one-star reviews of other restaurants.  This takes the cake.  WORST EVER.",

When the women finally came up she said \"what do you want\" and when the second person started to order she said \"hurry up I don't have all night\" we waited probably a half hour for our food and they just never brought out two of the plates. And when we asked about them the guy rolled his eyes and came back 10 minutes later with them. When we went up front to pay our waitress walked up to us and said \"where's my tip, gimme tip\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? If that's how you think you run a business you're very wrong.

The fruit was free and served by the busboy in the middle of him collecting our dishes. Credit card is not accepted if the bill is less than $20. At the end, we had to run out to get cash.

But then again, this is a Chinese restaurant and everyone knows service is going to be bad. If it were good, I'd be shocked.  So after several attempts at trying to find good dim sum, we ventured to this place after I saw it advertised on the Chinese channel while watching TV in the hotel. Believe it or not the hotel had Chinese satellite TV feeding from Hong Kong. I was up late watching old Cantonese soap operas -- but I digress.  So anyway, one of the places advertised was this one. Hubby thought for sure the food was going to be good seeing it obviously catered to a Chinese clientele. Well he was right. The dim sum, although not artistically created into teeny weenie morsels, were done well. Not only that but everything tasted good. The tripe was steamed with ginger and scallions -- lots of flavor, not like the one at Chang's. In fact, the har gow was also very very good (unlike that of Chang's). Cha siu bao was above average (and I don't even like cha siu bao) and so was the stuffed bean curd sheets.  I was a bit annoyed at the fact that when I asked for iced water, they kept passing the buck to someone else. Finally I just yelled out at a dim sum lady who then yelled out to 'amigo' in the back who rushed out towards me. Before he could even walk 5 steps I yelled out \"DOS AGUAS\" and he immediately turned around and got us 2 iced waters pronto.  4 stars for decent dim sum.  1 star for service.",

I brought two of my friends here because they wanted some good Dim Sum, and ended up wishing I went to practically any of the other Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.    We ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup, Green Beans with Minced Pork, Hong Kong Style Crispy Noodles, and Fried Fish.  The only thing that was even remotely flavorful was the green beans, and everything else was bland, cold, and under-salted.  The noodles were soaking in a bland gravy that tasted like they thickened water and put it on top of the noodles.  The fried fish wasn't crispy and was bland, as well.  The soup came out last, and very cold.  I couldn't believe they actually served this to us.  We tried to complain but no one understood what we were saying, and we didn't see the waiter after we ordered until we got our check.    Overall a terrible meal, and I definitely will not be coming back considering that HK Star and Joyful House are right down the street.",

I think the 1 star comes from poor service and how run down it is. The service is worse than a typical Chinese restaurant, but to me it's always been that way. My wife is Chinese and I'm used to the personality. However at seafood harbor it's worse. Seems to be accepted by management if not encouraged. It's a shame. A little clean up, and some lessons in customer service and they might see a real increase in sales",

We ordered some egg rolls that came hard like a rock, most likely from being refried.  We ordered some Mao Pao tofu and it wasn't even a little bit spicy.   We were entertained by a bunch of street racers that use the parking lot as a meeting grounds. Bunch of kids driving Hondas and a couple Miata.",

    "text": "This is a dim sum review only.  Sis and I were craving us some dim sum on Sunday morning in Las Vegas.  The hotel recommended Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant because \"many of our guests liked it\".  I'm not sure if their guests had much experience with dim sum because our meal was pretty disappointing.  Not that I've got that much experience with dim sum, but...  First of all, I love Las Vegas.  The city originally didn't have a Chinatown.  No problem!  They built a couple of strip malls on Spring Mountain Road and slapped pagoda roofs on them and asian businesses set up shop.  Now there is a proliferation of chinese, thai, korean and some japanese shops, bakeries and restaurants along Spring Mountain.  if you build it, they will come!  Harbor Palace is a large restaurant in (I think) one of the original strip malls.  The interior is very basic restaurant decor, without much in the way of fancy wall hangings or artistic pieces that you see in some Chinese restaurants.  But basic is okay and sometimes a good thing, if the food is good.  Sis and I were seated by the hostess and  served a lo mein dish (not sure if this is complimentary or not, more later).  We were being eyeballed by three cart ladies, who were standing with their dim sum carts a few feet away from our table.  After we have been sitting for a few minutes, each cart lady rolls her cart out of our area and disappears. The carts looked pretty full before they left so I don't know if they were serving other tables or reloading or what. By the time they get back to us and we've chosen our food, items are lukewarm at best.  The shiumai and the steamed wontons tasted pretty similar and everything was dry.  The steamed barbecue pork buns were okay but not hot.  There were a coiuple of other things that were fine but nothing that really stood out.  We passed on the chicken feet and porridge and ribs.  There were also other choices, such as seseme steamed buns and rice, but it didn't seem like a vast amount of choices.  We finished up quickly and got out after paying the bill which seemed reasonable but it was all in Chinese, so I'm not sure exactly what we got or whether the noodles we had were added to the bill.   Next time we will do a little more research, instead of relying on what \"other guests\" liked .",

The place was a little dirty, burned holes in the plastic (smoking in vegas? ;) ) but let me tell you about the food.   We ordered two fish dishes and a chicken dish along with dim sum. The serving sizes were nicely portioned we had tons leftover. And those who never eat fish were eating the food here and asking for me.  Want to know what I ate? we had to call it all chicken for my little niece to eat any of it, so the dishes were scallop chicken, white chicken, and just to tease her mind we called the chicken dish -- fish. And wow was she proud to tell her mom she liked fish :)",

They serve dim sum the traditional way by having ladies come around with carts. The quality of the food did not convince me. We were also pretty sad that the Chinese Broccoli was not ready yet.... We love our Chinese Broccoli....seriously love it too! They have a very homestyle flavor to their food here. Not that I know what homestyle Chinese food tastes like so much as the food has a really basic flavor to it here. It doesn't really stand out. Some of the dumplings reminded me of Mexican style chicken soup flavor. Not that that is bad really, but still I am used to better tasting dim sum. Service is not bad. They kept on asking if we wanted tea refills which s really good for this kind of place - especially when it's busy. If you do not wish to understand that some people that work and serve food in this country don't speak English terribly well you won't like it here at all and of course - you will mistake it for bad service. Parking is a breeze. This restaurant is in a nice big lot where many of the buildings have pretty Chinese style roofs.",

One of the things that initially bothered us about this restaurant during the first few times we went was that they had a $10 minimum purchase amount to use credit cards.    Well today when we went, our bill was about $34 for the three of us.  We decided to just have them split it between two credit cards.  The waitress came back and told us \"sorry, we have a $20 minimum purchase per card\".  What????  The fact that they raised their minimum credit card purchase to $20 was annoying, compounded with the fact that the bill was over $20, and she didn't want to do it just because it would have been split between 2 cards.  I told her she had no choice but to take the cards because it's against VISA and Mastercard's rules to impose minimum purchase limits, and they could lose their ability to accept credit cards if we reported them.  She either took my card, or she didn't get paid at all. Simple as that.",

It took them until after we were halfway through our meal to even get us our drinks. The staff going around seemed very disorganized and very unprofessional. The food wasn't even all that great. The first thing you see when you walk in is a very dirty fish tank. It was so dirty and green that you couldn't even see the fish unless they were right up against the glass. The whole restaurant felt extremely dirty and gross. And after finishing my meal, I noticed stuck pieces of dried food on the inside of my water cup, as well as some floating around in the water. Definitely will not be coming back.",

It is one of those place you cannot avoid seeing driving down from the Strip.  The decor was quite run down and dirty.  They served dim sum and other Chinese dishes.  Dim sum looked ok on average, while some of them looked somebody like vomited on it.  The taste was mind blowing in a negative way.  Some of them tasted like cardboard, while some just tasted bitter, and choices seem very limited.  The regular dishes had a unique bland flavor and gooey look to it, which was not appetizing at all.  Service was terrible here!  We called out for to the staffs a few times with no response and finally had to make some loud noise to get their attention, which really reminded me of mainland China.  Harbor Palace Seafood... Thank you for giving our group diarrhea on the way back to Utah, something was definitely undercooked.  On another hand, I found my worst Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas.  I never knew such taste can exist in dim sum, even worse than the worst in my home state.  Maybe that is one reason to try this place?",

They were located on W Spring Mountain Rd/Arville Rd in Las Vegas Chinatown.  As soon as we sat down, the metal carts surrounded us and kept on coming.  We started with:  Shark Fin Dumpling:  4 good sized thin skin dumplings filled with meat.  Pork Spareribs in Black Bean Sauce:  Average, a little fatty and not much black bean or jalapeno.  Custard Tart (Don Tot):  3 small bite-sized custard tarts.  I got these off the cart before they ran out.  Too many times I've gone to Dim Sum and the Don Tot are not ready or they are sold out.  This is one of my favorite childhood pastries.  Then we ordered:  Shu Mai: 4 shrimp and pork dumplings with a small shrimp on top.  More than bite-sized.  Har Gow: 4 dumplings filled with small whole shrimp.  Most places mince the shrimp.  Deep-fried glutinous rice dumpling with pork (haam sui gau): 3 crisp dumplings filled with ground pork and dried shrimp.  The shrimp was a nice touch.  Green Bell Pepper with shrimp: 3 slices green bell bepper topped with a shrimp paste.  This was a dish that not all Dim Sum houses serve.  My friend will be back just for these.  Baked Coconut Custard Buns: 3 baked buns filled with coconut custard.  My friend said Oakland (California) Chinatown is better.  I thought they were decent.  The carts kept on coming around. They didn't have a large selection of Dim Sum, but we could have ordered some items off the menu.  I was looking forward to the Chinese tamales, Sticky fried rice, and BBQ pork pie, but did not see any.   It took a while to get the check and a To Go box. There are a lot of other Dim Sum houses in the Las Vegas area, but I would come back.",

We got some fried rice, fried fish and an oyster stir fry and they were good but way to pricy for what it was worth.

The dumplings were ok. The pork ribs were ok. The rice congee was ok. The steamed shrimp with rice noodles were day old that were warmed up with watered down soy sauce. It was gross. The chicken feet were cooked in a vinegar sauce and that was awful. The shrimp ball was old tasting too.  They use to be very good for dim sum but what happened? I feel bad but it must of been the case of the Monday's. lol. Don't think I will return for dim sim here. :(",

Management came to my table insisting I pay for the dish we didn't order or eat. It wasn't even the correct dish for the other table. There's plenty of places in the area with good food as well, but it be a task to find a place with such poor etiquette as Harbor Palace.  Dine else where!",

We ordered the lobster noodle special (it wasn't on the menu but was on the specials board by the door), fish maw with crab meat soup, sauteed clam with ginger and scallion, and sauteed scallops with vegetables.  The fish maw with crab meat soup was light and flavorful, a great starter to our meal.   The lobster noodle dish was good, it was well seasoned and didn't leave me feeling bloated.  The sauteed clam with ginger and scallion was very tasty and had a lot of clams!   The sauteed scallops with vegetables was full of scallops and veggies and would be a perfect entree for one person (leftovers if eaten with rice).  Everything we had was delicious and generously portioned. We enjoyed the dishes family style and everyone was satisfied. The dishes weren't greasy or overly salty and didn't leave us feeling bloated.  The restaurant was clean and tidy, tables were cleared quickly once the customers left. The service wasn't the best since we never got our waters (we also order beer and hot tea so maybe they overlooked it) but everything else was great so I'm willing to overlook it.",

We expected to have to wait, like at most other dim sum restaurants on a Sunday, in Las Vegas, but the place was half empty.  We wil never go back.  The Dim Sum at Chang's is much better.  Everything we received off the carts was luke warm at best, nothing was hot.  The pai-don jook was watery.  The noodles used for the chow mein were not fresh.  They charge for tea, others don't.  The ice water tasted moldy.  The sign says they serve dim sum from 9 am till 3 pm, but by 2 pm, they were packing it in and cleaning everything up as the restaurant by this time was near empty.   The AUCE is $13.95 Mon - Fri & $16.95, Sat & Sun. When you're seated you simply tell them you want AUCE, except you can only get one crab ball per person and they will charge you for any food you don't eat. They keep track of what you eat, but you only pay the AUCE price. My wife & I only paid $33.90, otherwise our bill would have come to about $80.",

I ordered salt n pepper squid, it was okay but I think it was a frozen ones and when they cooked it, it didn't get the best taste. For that, they gave us reduced price for thLate dinner special not bad, we got orange chicken and beef kung pao. Seafood porridge is okay too, not the best but edible ^_^ The waitress who served us was pretty friendly though, so we were okay with the experience, moreover it's midnight in Vegas and we were so hungry, as a visitor here, we didn't know anymore where to go.",

It was 3 bite shu mai, light on black mushroom and flavor but still good. I also had their tripe and turnips, another good dish if I'd had room I would have had the wine blanched tripe.  It's definitely worth a visit. I was pleasantly surprised to find a female chef showcased on the wall. I'd pass on the noodles and soy sauce. They were dry and unremarkable. Save your stomach real estate for one of their tastier dishes. The staff was really nice and welcoming. I'll go back for sure.",

The service was frustrating though. 3 times I asked about a couple of items, and the server turned around to say something to other servers and then walked away. No one actually responded or answered my questions. No menu anywhere we could see so we were just winging it with what we know, or what was sitting in front of us. It was a bit early so I get having less options, but it would be nice to have some idea of what's going on if items aren't coming out yet.   Of course the items I had been asking about came out right after I got the check, and when we asked about ordering more I was met with a perplexed face and then she just sort of walked off. The language barrier I expect, but this was getting ridiculous to the extent of rude the times servers acknowledged me and then just kept walking.  With several options in china town, this is one I wouldn't recommend if it can be avoided.",

At first you think Dim Sum in the dessert? but honestly there are more than enough Asians in Vegas to warrant a great Dim Sum place! Service was average as well. not great but not bad. The only dish I had a complaint about was the Chow Mein. How do you screw that up? I mean Chinese invent it so long ago and just about everyone in the civilized world has tried it. Well unfortunately the noodles were way under-cooked. like eating a package of uncooked top ramen, and yes I know there are people that like to eat it that way. So if you're one of those people I have a great recommendation for you.",

I've been eating dim sum for over 30 years of my life and never once have I ever been treated as rudely and as disrespectful as I was treated here. Me and my mother and my sister came here to eat one morning and we were greeted with the most rudest of attitudes. When we asked one of the servers that was pushing a cart around did she have certain things we don't serve that here in a rude and nasty tone. We asked our server for basic condiments such as hot mustard chili and she got an attitude with us. Overall to put the icing on the cake I brought it to Management's attention about the rudeness and the lack of customer service and basically got Shrugged off did not receive an apology no type of discount. So for all you out-of-towners that come looking for good dim sum I would not recommend this place at all. Going forward me and my family will take our business elsewhere since you guys do not know how to treat customers with the respect. So for all use that are reading this please never eat here or go here unless you just want rude and bad service and maybe after they read this I'll finally get an apology for the rudeness that me and my mother and my sister experience there.",

I have to say, the dim sum was not good! It was very disappointing. I ordered siu mai, har gow, chicken feet, shrimp rice roll, glutinous rice wrapped with lotus leaf, pork bun, and this vegetarian dish. The soy sauce for the shrimp rice roll was really watered down for some reason so the rice roll tasted really bland. The chicken feet was alright but it was a little too oily for me. The siu mai and shrimp dumpling was alright too. You can't go wrong with ordering that at a dim sum place! The vegetarian dish was a little weird. They used too much corn starch to thicken the sauce and you can tell because the sauce was chunky. It was very unappetizing.   The decor of this place is kind of runned down and old. It definitely needs some renovation, especially because it was one of the restaurants in the main plaza of Las Vegas Chinatown. They should make an effort to build a better image for themselves and for the town.   The place was also understaffed. There was one lady taking care of 3 carts! I felt bad for her that she had to take care of all these tables and also manage her carts.   The tea that we ordered was also not that good quality because after the second refill of hot water, the tea became really bland and lost the taste and aroma of the tea! Usually tea leaves can last through couple of refills.   I am still on the search for a good dim sum place in Vegas!",

All things I expect in a more traditional chinese restaurant.  At any rate, bean curd and mushroom hot pot was actually quite good.

After a while, the ladies started flashing some smiles and we noticed it was because they were looking at our infant son. So if you want slightly friendlier service, bring a baby with you.   Food was \"passable\" as my hubby put it. He liked the chive and pork dumplings and not much else. I was taught to leave with at least one positive thought, so hmm... Egg tarts came out hot and fresh as we were about to leave, so that made up for the experience a teeny tiny bit. Also, the person who brought us our check who may or may not have been the owner, was super duper friendly and sweet.

If you get the dim sum buffet, the old ladies will nickle and dime you on every item and make sure you don't waste the food. One lady was really liberal with the food she gave us because she had all the cheap food??? or maybe it was her personality??? and the only one was as stingy as f... laying all the guilt on me in cantonese like she was one of my female aunties/relatives....\"one pork bun instead of the whole plate because you want to sample everything\"...\"one crab ball because this is expensive stuff\"...hubs tried to reason with her...that the sign on our table said one crab ball per person but that still took convincing and she had to doublecheck with the lady boss.  A lot of that \"expensive stuff\" looked like it had been on that carte a while because it was thoroughly wrapped up in plastic wrap for posterity.  The sign also says that if you don't finish all the food, there will be a penalty too so like a good little obedient asian kid who was cheap and didnt want to pay, I stuffed myself and we finished all the food. I usually don't do that at dim sum when I get the food-itis and feel sleepy, I stop eating and pack it all up but this time I packed my stomach. I guess that was good because I had energy to pound the pavement on the strip later in the day and I think it was $15 per person and two of those crabballs cost 9 bucks ala carte...but it sure made for a really stressful dim sum experience...I really would not prefer to go to a dim sum place where my moms was running the dim sum ever again.",

A few times we asked for the food to be reheated as it came out a little less than hot. We will definitely be back to give them another shot as we did enjoy the experience.",

Was visiting chinatown, and stopped in at this restaurant since it was the closest Dim Sum in the area. Being an all you can eat, the quality was definitely sub par. They still serve items off push carts, but the variety was limited. Was able to order speciality dim sum dishes off the menu, but those cost extra. Overall, given the vast number of dim sum restaurants in the area, would rather try one of the other restaurants and avoid this all you can eat variety.",

Small up charge for Jasmine tea, but we'll worth it.  Speaking of charges, the lunch special is only $6.50!!! Add a couple of bucks for 1 dim sum and you have reasonable priced lunch.

Though it's not an extensive dim sum menu, they have the typical ones, like shu mai and har gow. Their regulation menu are really great options as well. Highly recommend the Seafood Porridge if you're craving for some congee as well as their Mongolian Beef. Recently, not sure how recent, they added a lunch special and a late night special which were good ideas; a big serving of the entree with a heaping scoop of rice and egg roll. The service is also great, everyone is very attentive and the servers obviously know their regulars which I thought was great. Overall, a good place for some Chinese and I see no reason not to return again and again.",

But then, we ordered the lemon chicken, sweet/sour pork, and combo fried rice (my friend can't eat seafood and is picky about food, so we went with the most American sounding stuff.. lol).  Anyway, this lemon chicken was the best I've had... the chicken was so thick and moist... but crispy with an awesome sauce!  Most of the time it's thin and dry, but these people got it down perfect!  Also... the rice was one of the better that I've ever had!!  I don't know what's different about it, but the texture and flavor of this rice was sooo good!!  The sweet/sour porn was good too.  They also bring you some weird complimentary dessert that looks like soup... I was too stuffed, but my friend loved it.   I'll definitely be going back here!!",

This was the first time I've EVER seen a Chinese restaurant use a tablet to take our orders. You would THINK the ordering would be fast, but it took awhile for the woman to enter what we wanted.   The portion sizes were smaller than I expected. Even though the dishes were kinda expensive, they were simply delicious. It wasn't enough to fill our stomachs unfortunately...   I had originally thought of giving this restaurant 3 stars, BUT I simply CAN'T. You don't often come by such NICE people these days. The elderly man and woman were such sweethearts. They would come by our tables every so often to make sure everything was alright.  The best part? They have FREE dessert. It varies depending on party size. Small parties get oranges and fortune cookies. Large parties get red bean soup. Yum!  Gotta stop here for dim sum next time I come to Vegas! I heard it was good!",

Cook came out yelling at someone and had to get pushed back inside. WOW! Time to pay and the waitress is asking how much of the recommended tip I want to leave for them. Really I didnt want to give em anything....",

Some of the dim sum was ok, but the fried shrimp puffs were totally cold. The fried noodle dish was terrible. The noodles were suppose to be crispy, but instead they were soggy and the beef was rubbery with absolutely no taste. Needless to say I will never eat at this establishment again.

Still being guided by my rumbling stomach, I looked at nearby restaurants in Las Vegas' \"Chinatown\".  While walking around, The Love us on Yelp Sticker on Harbor Palace's door caught my eye.  I thought to myself, \"How awesome!!  Another loved yelp spot, the food here must be great!\".  Oh how I was wrong.  Immediately, when I got in there, the atmosphere was dreary, somewhat old fashioned, and a little unkempt.  I then thought, \" Well, maybe all the energy is poured into the excellent food and service, yelp will not let me down!  Again, I was completely wrong.  I started with the noodle dish and BBQed beef, and I ended with those.  I second that prior review, the noodles were both bland, dry, and greasy if you can believe that.  The BBQed beef was damn near all fat too.  I was like \"What the hell?  I didn't remember ordering a big dish of just meat fat.\"  This place needs to be checked out by the restaurant sanitary inspector because it looks a little dirty.  My waitress even brought out a disgusting looking fish bucket to show the table right behind me.  What was that all about?  And to top it off, I waited nearly 20 minutes for the waitress to bring me back a doggy bag.  My bill was 20 or so dollars for some reallyyy crappy food.   I felt ripped off, let down, and regretful I even entered the door with the supposed \"They love us on Yelp\" sticker.  How did they get that sticker?  Did they steal that?  Well, I sure felt that they had just stolen my money.  Avoid this place if you can.",

I was extremely hungry, and extremely happy with what I got.  I was too hungry to wait and see what all the carts had on them, so I went with char siu bow (bbq pork buns) and the sticky rice dumplings wrapped in leaves.  Then, call me a fool,  I simply had to have the gai lan  (ChineseBroccolli) with \"Korean Sauce\" poured over it.  'Bout the only asian foods I love more than gai lan are fresh lychees and Peking Duck  The gai lan was just as good this evening as leftovers, reheated with a little bit of deep-fried tofu.  I thought the service was decent, not unctuous, not friendly, but decent.  The decor was a bit battered, but I've yet to eat in a Chinese restaurant that has both beautiful decor and great Chinese food.  I'll try to go back once a month and eat my way through all the different things they have to offer on their dim sum carts.  That is, AFTER I try the Chinese BBQ place in the same center and Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast this Thursday...",

However, the nostalgia and good vibes ended there.  The scallops were dry, the chicken feet were tasty but a little too oily and had clearly sat in the dim sum steamer for too long. The pork spare ribs dim sum were alright.  All in all, I'd go again in a pinch, but not otherwise.",

    "text": "Went Easter Sunday for dimsum with our Chinese doctor friend and his precious family.  Even with 6 of us, we couldn't begin to try all the things I spotted.  I disagree with Keith (which is unusual), in that I thought they had enormous variety.  You definitely need to go with a large group of hungry adventurous eaters.  We had everything from  taro cake to shark fin dumplings, chicken feet, seaweed salad, crispy tofu -- tofu so many ways I couldn't keep track, simple things like eggrolls, dynamite dumplings of all shapes, sizes and fillings...we had chinese greens and bao buns that were to die for.  Our host explained that we should also order something from the menu -- he picked his favorite soup -- fish maw...but wouldn't tell us what it was until we'd tried it.  I liked it -- until as he suspected -- once he told me what it was -- then somehow it didn't taste as good anymore -- and I'm pretty adventurous...  He also ordered walnut shrimp which were also great - but one bite put me over the edge -- and I couldn't eat another thing....  I saw lots of things going by that I'd have loved to try...but it will have to wait.    We met our host at 11:30 and it was packed with a wait.  They have a separate room for large tables -- 8 or more -- which seems to be the way to go, interestingly, to bypass the line.  The owner is a good friend of our host's and picked up the check -- so I have no idea what the bill was and never saw a menu....what I can tell you is that we were the only non-Asians that I saw in the place -- and that, to me, is always the best sign of where to find something truly delicious and authentic to eat.  My husband offered to work for free for the owner because he was amazed at some of the dishes served...  We'll definitely be back for more.  And I can't wait to see the menu...I've about decided I must have been Chinese in another life...  now  if only I can find my favorite Northern Chinese dish...mock peking duck...",

Maybe it's my wit, and charming personality....good looking, dashing, debonair, fun, smart,......yea...But this isn't a review about me.  One thing I like - LATE NIGHT! I LOVE LATE NIGHT AFFORDABLE DINING. ESPECIALLY CHINESE! Because you get that craving on Mmmm I'm hungry. But the cool thing about chinese is you can eat a lot - 20 min later you're hungry again! I'm not sure if it's MSG...or it's the little parasites living in everyone's body from swimming in infested rivers.  To be honest. I like the food here. It's definitely chinese. But at the same time they do serve to curve the All American Apple Pie Appetite with things like orange chicken, lemon chicken, broccoli beef....zzzzzz Oh I'm sorry if you order these things...STICK TO PANDA! It helps if you've been to a chinese restaurant with a chinaman. Because they can order! They order fast and in small syllables. Next thing you know you have a feast to feed a small village.  I do like dim sum here....mmmm dumplings, shrimp or pok. Mmmm and the sesame ball. Ok so good. Good for vegetarian too. I find myself typing but in my head I'm speaking in a chinese accent....Weird. I think they've been friendly to me because I'm filipino. Oh yea that's it. Because the menu is catered to filipinos. Sure I can read most of the Tagalog on the menu. But where's the filipino food?? Oh...Rice....",

Just like other typical dimsum places. I had it so often in my childhood, I kind of lost appreciation for it.  I really liked their pineapple bun filled with custard. So delicious! It was a new alternative that I hadn't had before.  Their fried dough ball coated in sesame seeds with the ground black sesame filling is amazing! Crunch & crispy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside. I totally blanked out on what this dish is called in Chinese... lol sorry.

I say let's wait until the hour, we'll ask what's going on, so we did! After that one lady came near and asked if we were ready to place our order?! We said we already did and showed her the copy of the order & she said oh we're not serving duck at this time... ?!?! We were very upset, the lady who took the order in the first place should have said that to begin with, there was no communication between the employees, they didn't even apologize instead they handed us a check for the drinks and the dim sum. I can say after service like that I will not return to this place.",

She was so rude to say, she not grantee steamed chicken feet black bean sauce is fresh today, but she grantee steamed beef in rice noodle roll is made today. She just cancel the chicken feet for me, and didn't allow me return the rice roll also. She look like so much unhappy, and the waiter and waitress have bad servers, too. And the price for staff are little bit expanse. I never go to here any more.",

So I checked in with yelp and a nice surprise showed saying we get 20% off our bill. The coupon said in small print from 10pm-2am, it was 9:54pm when we ordered. They had a special for lobster buy one get one free for $48.95 so we ordered the lobster special, seafood soup, snow pea tip and clams in oyster sauce. The soup came out nice and hot but lacked in flavor - it was very bland, the clams was nothing special- taste like any other Chinese restaurant, the snow pea tip was smothered in oil and soggy. The lobster was a disappointment as well, it was more like buy one lobster and get a half lobster free- there were missing pieces to our lobster- we definitely did not get another lobster for free and it was very tiny for the price. The best part was when we asked if we could use our 20% off coupon they said yes and then came back to us and said \"sorry sir you ordered your food at 9:54pm and the coupon starts at 10pm.\" We politely said \"ok no problem, we understand if that's your policy.\" But...really? Does it makes a difference for that 6 mins? It's all about customer service! Let's just say we will not be coming back.",

There were a lot of people that came all at once to the restaurant and for some reason they were able to get their food quick as hell, while my family waited patiently an hour for our food.   Moreover the waiters did not check up on our tables like they did with others. I felt as if I was constantly ignored.   Food was alright. Customer service-  lets me honest - was horrific! They barely had any common customer courtesy.   If you're a tourist finding some food around China Town, #1 rule - and I mean it - don't go to this place! You'll be waiting until the sun goes down for your food! Go somewhere else and get some pho. There's better restaurants out there than this piece of crap.   Thank you for reading!   ",

Our friends walk in and we decide to keep them company because they decided to order a few things.  So we share our to go's with them have a nice dinner.  Time for the check again they put it all on one.  Ok no problem let's get this fixed because I'm a receipt keeper. Ohhh they printed out a second receipt looks like from a calculator adding their 20% tip lol hey I don't mind you we're gonna get it anyway.  So now he's arguing with me about how he doesn't know how to do that I explain that I like to keep a record of my card transactions and we were paying with 2 different cards would we be able to each tip.  He said ya ya I'll charge both cards.  Ok whatever I jus want to leave because he's not going to do it I think he was more worried about making sure he gets that 20% tip.  For all that trouble and arguing with me we decided to do a 15% tip.  Well according to the bank statement they took another $10 wow I've never seen that before.  If that $10 was more important than having repeat business keep it.  The food was ok.  The place is dirty they were big dumplings droppings under our table.  The bathroom was disgusting.  I can say I tried it and I'll tell everyone on social media not to go there",

Overall, their food is just average in temperature (never \"fresh\"), taste and price.",

The dim sum tasted like it was a day old and were just reheated to serve.  service: contrary to other reviews, the servers were actually friendly ambiance: diiiiiiiiiirty south, including the bathroom. yuck.  How the heck can you go wrong with dim sum? I should've yelped this place before deciding to meet up with some buddies.  5 girls= all gave 2 thumbs down each.",

But not really worth coming off the strip just for.  It's OK.  Avoid the dim sum as it is usually not fresh and overpriced, i.e. the steamed stuff have been sitting around long enough for like siu mai/har gow wrappers to start to harden.  Aiyah!  As usual service helps a bit when you can speak Cantonese at these places.  All in all, average.",

When I tried to complain to the manager about having the late dish taken off my bill she tried to pin it on the server. It was not the servers fault. The restaurant is unorganized. Food is decent but not worth the extravaganza",

They have your usual dim sum selection- shu mai, potstickers, dumplings, sesame balls, etc. It has always tasted like your typical dim sum, which is what brought me back. Besides, it's close to where we usually stay and it was convenient for lunch before leaving Vegas.  So why am I over it? The server got upset because our tip was inadequate. Honestly, what server provides you with horrible service and then brings your tip back to you and says, \"What is this? This is not enough!\"? Oh, it gets better. She proceeded to calculate the \"correct\" tip amount for us and said that was how much more we owed her.  Need I say more?",

    "text": "Oh, my goodness.  My parents and I had longer-than-usual stay in Las Vegas and were tired of food and buffets on The Strip, so we decided to venture into LV's \"Chinatown\" and see what we could scrounge up to eat.  We saw lines in a few places, but we decided to settle for dim sum.  It seemed to be really popular because the restaurant lobby was vomiting out people.  I mean, really, spewing people out everywhere, loitering and waiting about.  My parents, being the stubborn people that they are, decided to take a number and wait.  With a small party of 3, the wait shouldn't be that long.    Well, it was.  By the time I got in, I was starving.  We waited for almost an hour.  By that sheer fact, I thought the food would be wonderful.  I mean, why else would people be waiting that long to eat?  Let down again.  I mean, it was relatively good considering I've been living in NH where their dimsum selection is a little... well, non-existent.  And it's the first bite of dimsum I've had in months and months.  So, it wasn't bad.  But I am still well-aware that there is plenty of good dimsum back in SF.  I mean, much better.  They were sooo busy, that no one paid attention to us when we wanted to pay our bill.  And the place smelled funny.  And it was SO crowded.  I was such between my dad's elbows and someone else's baby carriage.  With a baby in it!  Watching me eat!  Good Lord.  Next time, I'm sure we'll try somewhere else if we wanted dimsum in Las Vegas.",

Late night I usually order a fried rice.  Either the Yang Chow, BBQ pork or the salty fish and chicken fried rice. I also usually get an entree like fish with black bean sauce, fried pork chop with salt and pepper, fish with spicy salt and pepper or a soup like the won ton or the hot and sour soup. All the above dishes are pretty decent flavor wise. Good enough for 3am as far as im concerned.  The other times I goto this place are in the early afternoon for dim sum. Last time I went for dim sum they had the carts rollin around as usual. I have never had to fill out any type of paperwork to eat dim sum at this place. The dim sum is decent. I usually get sesame balls, pork bun, shumai, harcow, and chicken feet. All pretty standard in terms of flavor. Nothing really stands out or lets me down.  The service not bad at all. I have been eating at Chinese food joints for over 30 years from Hong Kong to Thailand to San Francisco to New York to Jakarta....you get the idea. All that \"Asian folks are so well mannered and polite\" is some stereotype junk. These cats wanna know what you want to eat and drink and thats it. Dont expect any type of convo/banter especially if you dont speak the same language.  Lots of folks mistake cultural differences for bad attitudes. Dont get it twisted folks. We all have bad days and good days. Maybe I got it all wrong but then again im not an over sensitive attention monster.  Food: B - Step up your food game guys, dont get complacent. Service: B - Train your employees to handle problems better. Cleanliness: C - You really need to do a complete cleaning of the store Overall: B-/C+ - I will continue to eat here just wish they would improve.  This place aint as bad as people are saying. All the basics for a great Chinese restaurant are there. Management just needs to remember that they have to try and improve every single day...",

I've read bad reviews about the bathrooms...  They are \"Circus Circus\" clean bathrooms NOT Mandalay Bay bathrooms which is fine for a small restaurant. The people are very nice and polite. The prices are a bit on the high side compared to other places but I am not from the area or state so I cannot comment on the cost of living.  I had hot tea but asked for cokeS for my wife and daughter and they knew to bring forks for them.  Overall they have good food and good service, but prices on the high side. There were 3 of us and the bill was $60+. However I did have some take home so you could subtract about $8 of it...  I also went a bit overboard since I have not had Dim Sum in quite awhile.",

    "text": "Have not been here in years AND WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!!, After reading the other reviews it seems as though nothing has changed.  I still remember the visit here vividly as it was the worst experience i have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life! I remember how dirty the place felt with the tacky decor, should have been a sign to run. Second issue the host had attitude to seat us in a booth with two children said no children allowed in booth. Didn't wanna hassle finding another place though because kids were hungry. We ordered walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, salt n pepper pork chop and fried rice. About thirty minutes later I ask a guy where our food was. He said what food!? So I say never mind we are leaving. The original lady who took our order saw we were trying to leave started shouting \"why u leave no pay, food coming u need to wait\" [sic] 5 min later they proceeded to bring out food, they brought out fried shrimp, soup and Chinese broccoli. I said we didn't order this. She argued yes you did. By now I'm so livid I didn't wanna make a scene so I asked my husband to deal with them before I explode. So I go to the car. 20 minutes later he is walking to the car with the food we didn't order and I guess our order then I see the lady chasing him and saying no tip for me not even one dollar!! OMG are you serious?????!!!!!! She had the audacity to literary follow him outside and say this in the parking lot! Of course no tip, not after the absolute worst service ever !! That I thought was the worst part. My husband gets in the car to tell me the check was $83 meaning they charged us for the food we did not order!!!!!!!!!!!! He said the host who takes the checks wouldn't budge and said how does he know its not our fault and we keeping the food anyways even though we said we didn't want it he said ok we still made food if u keep or throw away u still have to pay! Unbelievable!!! If you want to experience a nightmare go here! Not saying your experience will be as horrendous as mine , but just thought I'd share my dining out nightmare here as I can see I'm not alone In this.  Yelp should have a \"worst restaurant poll\" guarantee this will come up! Shut harbor palace down!!!",

    "text": "There's a reason why Harbor Palace ranks on the bottom of my list of dim sum places in Vegas.  It was my second visit ever and it just reconfirmed my experience from the first time I went.  Saturday brunch - 11:30 am arrival.  Not as busy as I would expect.  (Bad sign.)  We have a large party, five adults and four children.  As a result, we're seated in one of the larger tables in the room set off to the right of the restaurant.  We had barely sat down, especially with getting all the young kids seated, when the cart lady was hollering, \"You want dim sum!?\"  I was immediately put off with her attitude and probably would have left if it was just the Husband and I.  (My Chinese friend mentioned that her mom has a simple standard of dim sum restaurants - tea should be placed on the table before the food is brought out.  And she's right.  Growing up, that's the first thing I remember from my many dim sum brunches.  The waiters ask what kind of tea you want (usually as you're getting situated), and before the carts come, the tea is on your table.)  But in this case, we felt so pressured to order from the lady's cart and had baskets of food on our table way before the beverage guy came around to ask what we wanted to drink.  (I will say that he brought the tea and water over quickly and had our tea pots filled the whole time, of course with my help of flipping the cover up.)    We got the typical orders of pork dumplings and shrimp dumplings.  Nothing special here, more dried out from over-steaming, if that makes sense.  We got a couple orders of beef balls and was surprised they didn't cut it in half (I've always seen it cut in half), nor was any Worcestershire sauce given.  Rice noodle dishes came by and I asked (in Cantonese) if they had Beef Noodle Roll.  She said they did, looked around, then asked if I wanted the Pork Spare Ribs one.  I said fine, and then she asked about the Shrimp one too, which I said was fine.  (Although she did try sneaking another one onto our table until we caught her in time to just say only one!)  And of course, the beef one never showed up.    I asked for Egg Custard Bun, and she said they had it, but tried passing off some yellow bean one as well.  We did eventually get the Egg Custard Bun and it was not good....hard, dry and old.  Bleh!  Deep fried chicken wings were decent the first time around, but even better when we got them nice and hot.  The deep fried salt and pepper shrimp was also nice and hot when we got it too.  Other dishes included steamed pork buns, chow mein noodles, Chinese broccoli (been sitting out too long), shrimp and tofu, chicken feet, and steamed beef tripe.  Nothing memorable though.  The Husband wasn't eating much from the very start and I had to wonder why.  He discreetly pointed to the HAIR that was sitting on his rice noodle dish.  Oh. Yuck.  (And unfortunately we did not say anything about it then or at the end since we were with guests.  But normally, we would have at least tried to point it out after we paid.  And no, you never say anything during your meal because we all know what happens at Chinese restaurants if you complain.)  Overall, Harbor Palace is just not that good. We weren't that impressed the first time and we aren't impressed now.  And the service is beyond bad here.  Sure, I know everyone says you can't expect much on service at dim sum restaurants, but this places leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  It's not even worth tolerating.  They do have hot chili oil available on the tables, not just regular chili sauce.  And please stop asking for Sriracha sauce, you know who you are!",

    "text": "I have never been to this restaurant in person. This review is based on my delivery experience.  Take-out or delivery \"Chinese\" food is ubiquitous in any American city with a population of over 100k. And most major American cities have a neighborhood designated as \"China Town.\" In spite of that, there are few Chinese restaurants here in Vegas that serve food that people in China eat, as opposed to Chinese food.  This restaurant serves what Chinese people call \"food.\" And I call it \"delicious.\" And except for their specialties, very affordable (they have abalone braised in oyster sauce. $80, but who's counting. Maybe I'll get a GoFundMe account, 'cause I REALLY wanna try that! I imagine that's not precisely what GoFundMe is for, though.)  The chicken with ginger and scallions is sublime. The \"mustard greens with top soup\" is a bit hard to understand; they pack the greens and soup separately. It is delicious, too. And fried rice is fried rice, but they raise the bar a bit.  I understand they do dim sum. I can hardly wait to visit them and have some authentic dim sum, which I hear they do very well.  I subtracted one star because they serve shark fin soup. But I won't pontificate here, it's not appropriate. Suffice to say, if you're tempted, and have never tried it, it's not worth the money (shark fin soup in general). I had it once, in Hong Kong, and it was so \"meh.\" Okay, I guess I pontificated a little. So sorry!  Please do try this establishment out. If you prefer American style Chinese food, they can accommodate your tastes, and if you want try something different and closer to what they eat in China, they have plenty of options. And if you've got enough moolah for the abalone or lobster, send me a note and tell me how it was!",

Much larger than the typical potstickers you find in restaurants that offer them. We also had fried rice with no soy sauce to reduce the sodium intake and it was very well-made.

But some of our best meals have been in these types of places so we gave it a shot.  Service - Waitress didn't even give us two minutes to sit down before she asked what we wanted to order. We had to call her away 3 times since we were still looking at the menu... she could benefit from a lesson in learning body language. We ordered 6 things, only 5 came out. Which was good in the long run because it was too much food anyways.   Seafood soup bit salty but decent. Chewy.   Sweet and sour fried fish was done very well. Crispy fresh fishsteaks drizzled with yummy sauce. Similar taste to squirrel fish.   General Tso chicken (my banana sister wanted this) tasted exactly like a mediocore replica of the fish dish above, except with dry chicken pieces. Disappointing.  Veggies - they ran out of the ones we wanted so we tried asking about a different type (but very popular) mushroom dish. They looked confused and did not understand, maybe from a different part of china? We did not get what we wanted, but a much slimier kind of mushroom.   Chow Fun (seriously I dont know why my parents let her choose the menu so american) - very oily, HeFuns were pieces rather than long strands, making it difficult to eat.   Decent seafood but mediocore in everything else. Almost no other chinese in the restaurant, probably should have known. Oh well.",

Plus, the ambience is good but you can hear a lot of noises in the kitchen which distracts the restaurant setting.",

    "text": "A friend had recommended us this place for Dim Sum. The restaurant has a nice decor with friendly staff. There is parking in the front as well.  They had your standard dim sum options of shu mai, pai gu-ot, and so on. The food was okay. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the best (even though our friend who was a local said this is the place to go for dim sum). There wasn't too much taste I felt like with some of their dishes, but that's me comparing them to some dim sum places that I always go to in New York.  The staff was very friendly and attentive to my party of 6. There were probably two or three other tables filled while we were there so the restaurant wasn't that busy. I'd say if you're just looking to fill your stomach with some reasonably priced food then come here.",

I've always ignored it cause the dim sum is decent and at the time, it was the only place I knew in china town to have dim sum. Plus, in general, I always get bad service at Chinese joints. The worst was when we came in a large group. They were so disrespectful throwing our food down, and not responding when we would request something. Our group just sat there in silence at the end of our meal. We started discussing how much to tip. A person in our group who was a residence of Vegas said not too, and said something about how, in Vegas, we don't tip. He was a fairly rude guy himself lol but the worker came behind him, bent over and demandingly yelled in his ear \"15% tip please\". Oh man, he was furious. He stood up and yelled at us and his girlfriend to leave while she was still eating her tofu dessert lol it's pretty funny to think back but at the time, it was the worst experience ever.   Seriously, go to Orchid garden for dim sum.",

Service - ***BEWARE of the owner/manager...if you don't leave tip, she will ask for tip. That's the first time I ever heard anyone from an establishment question you why you didn't leave a tip. Tip is voluntarily and we weren't happy with the service or food, so you're not entitled to leave extra money. Smh.  Place - out dated and dusty.",

Dim Sum not as tasty as it was. Doesn't seem fresh either. The fried noodles were dry and seemed like they were sitting on the cart for some time. I didn't bother to order the Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli) as it looked over cooked and cold. The place is out dated, old and dirty. There's even a smell of body odor throughout the place. I think it's stuck in the old carpet.   I'm sorry for the harsh comments. But I wanted to be completely honest and not have other customers be disappointed like I was.

Other things I saw: small fried fish, chicken wings, seaweed, soft tofu, stewed beef intestines, diff types of fried shrimp balls, deep fried shrimp with head, authentic plain greasy chow mein, steamed Chinese broccoli, bean curd, steamed buns (sweet or with meat filling)... Etc.  Btw, seemed only the owner spoke good English, everyone else.... You can't get too intricate with them. Service was efficient but, some of the dim sum cart ladies need to learn some manners.

I specifically did not read any online reviews prior to going, thinking that if it wasn't the best, it would be average, good Chinese food. The space itself is fine. The entire staff is disorganized but no one was rude. The menu is primitive, long, and confusing. They need to be thrown out and redone. The quality of the food was uniformly poor. We ordered the #3 dinner special. They put out very bad appetizers and soup and forgot about the entree. I didn't eat the chicken or shrimp because they looked disgusting. I couldn't bring myself to snap a photo because I thought that I would gag if I looked at it. The fried rice had some visible lard on it. Just to sum it up, the service is confused (in a big way) and really bad food. They were not busy when I went and I did not try the dim sum. I will never go back here.",

I had the roasted duck, I can clearly see it was not fresh and taste like it was reheated. hai gow tastes old. I recall I can smell a foul scent coming from the restroom as I entered.   During this visit my friends suggested to have dim sum before our drive home.  We followed them from behind, as we patiently waited to  signal  to turn into the parking lot. I told my husband \"No!, not here\".  My supportive husband all he can do was laugh. Here I am dragging myself to get out the car and hubby tugging me along. Yup! still dirty nasty carpet, this time I didn't get a whiff of the bathroom smell. We were greeted by two friendly staff at the front door.   My friends did all the ordering, there were 7 of us they each pointed / asked what they want from the dim sum cart. I decline my request. kept thinking why am I back here again. Than reality hits me. its because for the company of great friendship.  I ate the steamed Chinese broccoli, fried garlic snow pea leaves. it was good. Decided to try the hai gow again, yes! still taste rotten, old meat. the chicken feet was ok? we all thought it lacked flavors.  5 of 7 had the same thought the  fried chicken wings were really salty, it was left unfinished. My girlfriend whispered to me she didn't like the hai gow \" it taste spoiled\".  3 stars for the service provided and giving us a chance to connect with one another.

Yelped and found this place (despite all the other bad reviews). There happened to be a lot of street vendors in the plaza that day, so the parking situation was terrible.  Once inside, the waitress told us to sit at the table towards the back and to start ordering anything we like off the carts since they didn't have an itemized dim sum menu. We got the usual - har gow, shu mei, shrimp rice noodles, gluttonous rice, etc. The cart ladies were really nice even though I was speaking to them in broken Chinese. They kept checking on us and helped us box up the food as we ordered. Because we didn't know how many carts were going to come out, we sat there for a while and even started eating the porridge. Omg, this really hit the spot especially after a weekend of drinking and partying.   I think we ended up sitting there for a good 30 minutes before paying our check, which isn't really considered fast to-go food, so if you're in a hurry, you should have a better idea of what you want to get beforehand. Overall, the food is tasty and this will definitely be my go-to dim sum place in Vegas.",

    "text": "Ran through the Plaza to go to Ranch 99.  They were all out of the steamed sweet white rice cakes but had other things I needed.  On the way back to the car I passed by Harbor Palace and saw the painted 'dim sum' sign on their window.  All dim sum places have rice cakes, right?  It appeared very busy when I walked in but an older Chinese man came to the podium to ask for my order.  I asked him if they had the cakes, he walked over to a nearby cart and held up the asked for cakes.  I nodded and said I would like two orders.  He went to a little side table to box them and came back with them in a bag.  He said the charge was $5. Which I paid in cash. At home I opened the styrofoam container to find two 5x5 inch squares about 1/2 inch thick.  That was 2 orders for $5!  They were just okay, taste wise... If this is an indicator of their food, my recommendation is to pass.",

Other dim sum dishes we ordered were mediocre at best, and cost about $3 per item for small portions.   We also ordered Beijing sweet & sour ribs, and a chicken with vegetables dish. These dishes came out quick and were pretty tasty. We had enough for leftovers for a family of 4. I'd recommend ordering any of the regular entrees vs. dim sum.  On the plus side, this place is pretty much open all the time.",

Everything about it from customer service to quality of food is unsatisfactory. Place looks dirty too! If a place serves daily dim sum it better at least taste fresh, but it wasn't. I came to try it out only because a friend referred it. We came in a large group of almost 20. We waited a Long time for dim sum cart to come around. Had to go ask them to bring cart around. I feel the the waitress played dumb by asking several times what we need to order. Told her 1 chicken shark fin soup and 1 lobster dish.  She comes out with 2 lobster dish and 2 soup!!!! Wth?! Soup was $49 for a bowl that serves 5 small cup. The soup tasted so plain! We didn't order it but got it anyways. We also ordered clams which never came out. And ate dim sum. When the ticket came out it was ridiculous amount for place like that! Almost $500! Overall the food quality doesn't match prices on menu. Over priced!!!They charged $8 for 1 bowl of steam rice! They charged us for  60 dim sum dishes too. The numbers looked really off!  I would say 40 but not 60! I went to check on price with cashier and came back to count empty dim sum plates but they had cleared off everything on table! Not to mention the waitress followed me to spy on me when i went to talk to cashier. Must be a reason for that! They are scammers! I've heard of dim sum places that over charge u but I've never experienced it. I'm never ever coming here again! I highly suggest not to come to this place.",

We first started w shrimp chow mein. It was a typical chow mein. Flavors were nice, portions were big but lacking the plentiful of bean sprouts I usually like in my noodles. The menu was pretty standard for an asian restaurant, beef, chicken, soups, shrimp etc...  Second we ordered squid w snow peas and I think a bean sauce, but that's not what came out. We tried it anyway but the squid was really bland and wasn't seasoned at all. I couldn't eat this.  Lastly we got as advertised, fresh live fish. It was sea bass today and to choose between steamed or fried, we got steamed. Being said it was live fresh fish I though i'd get a whole fish. I didn't. It was nice and moist, very good, but could have used some lemon, although I don't think that's traditional for this type of food.   Overally I give it a 2 out of 5.",

    "text": "Lackluster service with takeout quality food.   My girlfriend and I took her father here. We entered the restaurant and the host was on a personal phone call with her back to the door. We listened to her for a while, then she realized we were there and quickly hung up. We were sat at a table with a dirty table cloth under a pane of glass.   The president was in town and Channel 8 was showing the speech. I asked if they would show the speech on one of the three TVs which were all turned off. The manager said the TVs were reserved for advertising, and turned on one of the TVs to some type of advertising channel which did not show advertisements for the restaurant (think video games and movies.) The other two were not turned on.   The menu has approximately 200 entrees and took a while to read. The servers seemed impatient, and I do mean servers, as we had multiple servers.  We got our appetizer, and the server spilled the sauce on the table. She said, \"Oops,\" but did not clean it. The entrees were not far behind, and the same server set the first dish in the sauce she had spilled.   The food was food, and I cannot say it wasn't. Her dad and I ordered a two person family dinner. It was greasy, bland, and surprisingly poor quality for $15 a person, but it was still food. My girlfriend's hot pot was bad. It was still food too, but she did not enjoy it. We ate until we were full, and then I used the bathroom.  Which brings me to the bathroom. The exterior door was filthy; the kind of filthy which causes you to dread entering the restroom. Think \"behind the gas station in Kingman, AZ\" dirty. Once in the men's restroom, you will find there are two urinals. The one on the left was leaking onto the floor, and the leak spread under the other urinal. This makes it impossible to use without standing in the leak. The leak runs even further under the stalls, and I imagine your pants would get wet if you had to sit on the toilet. The floor was sticky in the dry spots.   We shall never return.",

Due to convenience, I checked into this restaurant and ordered some dim sum.  The quality of the dim sum was sub par and I totally regret not checking out current reviews on Yelp. Dim sum there did not taste good, quality was not good and in such a highly populated Chinese community in Vegas. The problem is that it's expensive. I would not mind paying more for quality and good dim sum, but not on this restaurant. I used yelp review to find a close to 4 stars review on a dim sum place in Vegas called Chang's Hong Kong cuisine, dim sum there was undoubtedly much better than this restaurant. Always check for reviews from yelp first before trying a restart out, or you will regret.",

There is no wait to get seated. The host sits us on any table we prefer on either table setting or booth-type seating. Sometimes,a few or no diners at this hours of early morning. Food service is quick to moderate wait.   Noticeably, the menu have Chinese characters as well as below the English food titles are Filipino language translations. Is it because the owners are also of Filipino heritage or is it that the restaurant's dining patrons are predominantly Filipino? Interesting.  A wide variety of entree in the menu consisting of appetizer, soup, various seafood entrees (shark's fin, abalone, sea cucumber, lobster, crab, geoduck clam, scallop, shrimp, clam, oyster, squid, fish), various fowl entrees (squab, duck, chicken), beef, pork, vegetable, bean curd, fried rice, hot pot, sizzling plate, noodle entrees. Spicy Items are indicated. The usual soup I order each time I dine here is \"Fish Maw with Crab Meat Soup\" which is filled with fish and crab meat in a flavorful thickened broth. Hot Pots are generous and steaming hot. Oyster is also another favorite item ordered which are large-sized. Never overcooked.   Family Dinner Combinations are also available starting from $12.95 - $17.95. A Special Lunch menu served 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mondays to Fridays Only at $5.95 is a good deal to have which includes soup of the day, an egg roll and fried rice. Sometimes, this is an order I make when in the vicinity of \"Chinatown\", conveniently packed in a styrofoam box on a take-out request.  Just not expect quick attention to your needs, the servers seem to be preocuppied with something else when you need to get their service.",

I will only come here if i am meeting friends here and suggesting another place is out of the question.  havnt had dim sum here, but my close friend didnt like this place very much either.  I had dinner here... the food was ok, but i've had better.",

Service was ok, the ladies speak minimal English. On the upside, our food came out quick. Also, the dim sum part was good. Think ill come back solely for Dim sim next time.",

All of the food tasted fresh,  plus get this, my service was good.  Now, I can understand why people think the staff is rude, but they were nice enough for my group.  I totally will go back to this place next time I'm in town.",

They were extremely oily and not tasty.  Again, avoid this restaurant. It's not worth your money let alone your time. Oh, I agree with the other reviews. The service is lukewarm.",

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant 4 times before and liked it OK. I find it funny that the menu is in Chinese of course, but also has subtitles in Tagalog.  I like it when ethnic restaurants are full of diners of that ethnicity; They're keeping it real.  Today I was craving the Walnut Shrimp.  I pull into the parking lot and there's a crowd of people waiting to go in. What !?!? That's never happened before. I guess this is a popular place on Sunday morn compared to the weekday afternoons that I have been here before. I get inside and am seated quickly. And there are ladies with dim sum carts. I have not had that since I left LA years ago. The Walnut Shrimp can wait for another day.  Hot green tea was brought to my table quickly.  I got my food from the first carts to come my way: calamari, fried shrimp, steamed shrimp in a thin dough and 2 dessert type buns: pineapple and coconut. I liked it all. The hot food was hot; the fried food was crisp; the dessert buns were soft. It all tasted fresh.  Took most of it home since I was alone and could not possibly eat it all in one sitting.  I think the servers did a good job. They got people in and out quickly. There is a language barrier but to me that just adds to the experience.  p.s. After reading Yelp reviews, I guess it's a good thing that I have never seen the lady's bathroom LOL.",

We checked in on YELP and saw that there are free Egg Rolls when you check in. Two of us checked in and we showed the server our phones so we could get our free egg roll. We got a rude reply of \"ONLY ONE PER TABLE!!!\" Sheesh lady, you could tell us in a better way rather than raising your voice at us. Never going back to this place!",

    "text": "I'm not really sure what the rest of the dim sum scene is like in LV, but I thought this place was pretty good. We waited about 5 minutes for a table on Sunday around noon and although the dining room is pretty small compared to the giant places in SoCal, it was pretty packed. There was a decent selection and I found all my favorites including a few new ones like the roast pork. I just wish they had one of those carts that grilled up the radish cakes instead of putting them in the steamer.   The 4 of us ate until we were stuffed and the bill was only $32! I think this is a great option when you've had enough with the buffets and just want something different. Plus they're open from 10 AM to 5 AM which is crazy, even by San Gabriel Valley standards!",

    "text": "This was some serious good eating! I wasn't aware of Vegas' dim sum scene, but this place offers simple, traditional, tasty and pretty good service of dim sum for the area. The prices are very reasonable!   They have the little push carts that go around and that's a rareity to see these days in many of the new dim sum tea houses. It does help to speak the language (Cantonese or Mandarin), as the ladies on the carts will be more attentive to what you want to try or eat.   We ordered the usual items like ha gor (shrimp dumpling), siu mai, steamed pork bun, chicken feet (yes!), pork ribs, congee with preserved duck egg and some other items.  We fed a party of 3 for only $40 - not bad! And, we were full at the end of our meal.   The decor is a bit old school, so don't expect to be wow-ed by the restaurant's looks. Parking can be tough on the weekends, but there is a big lot. You just have to drive around a bit to find a spot. Otherwise, this place is a steal.  I would definitely come back again!",

I can see the server handing the cashier the money and her giving the change back,  he pockets the $70 change and leaves to smoke in front of the restaurant . OH HELL NO!!! I run up to the cashier, explain to her what happen, she didn't speak a word of english and  now im using a calculator t explain that the server TOOK MY MONEY,  thinking i just tipped him over 50%... so the man server comes back in and now im yelling at him that he took my money and he's yelling me that I tipped him 70 bucks and its his.... Wooo SA ...  I made a scene and got my change back..",
