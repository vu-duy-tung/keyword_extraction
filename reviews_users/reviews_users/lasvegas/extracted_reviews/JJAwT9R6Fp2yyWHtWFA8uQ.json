    "text": "This place is awesome!  We went on a Saturday evening (10pm). It wasn't packed and we were seated at the bar right away. The chef there was super friendly and told us what was fresh for the day and what the best sellers were.   The ayce option is great- their yellowtail, fatty salmon, and eel were the best in my opinion. We also get one order of uni and sweet shrimp per order. Those were really fresh.  One thing that separates this place from others- service. The owner was there at 10pm on a Saturday. She seems really dedicated to the business and actually didn't leave until She made sure everyone's water was refilled even though she had told her team she was going home 10 minutes earlier. That's dedication!  Next time I'm back in Vegas I'll make sure to come back. It's only about a mile off strip.",

    "text": "Well let me just say first that I would have like to give sushi way 4 stars based on the food, but it had to many other hang ups keeping me from giving it the 4 star rating.   My wife, family, and I love to eat sushi. We usually find ourselfs in vegas 1 to 2 times a year. When we come to Vegas we usually eat sushi at least 2 times during our stay. We usually look look on Yelp for new AYCE sushi restaurants. This trip we tried island sushi, and sushi way. Island sushi was a great experience. When I found sushi way it had limited reviews, but the pictures looked great. We decided to go ahead and give it a try.  When we sat we were the only customers there. We put in our order very quickly. The appetizers came out pretty quick,and were very tasty.   Sushi on the other hand was a different story. There was only one sushi cutter. More customers started to arrive. The sushi cutter looked like he was off in outer space. There was no sense of urgency. There was a 60 min time cap when eating. We were there for 2 and half <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhours.im&s=8b0ce2a7a8f4caadce54bb7b5ff291ee02029ecc0d0ac29ca87cf3967035366e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hours.im</a> guessing they let us go over the time limit because it was taking 10 mins in between half orders rolls.Sometimes when i would look at the cutter,  he would just be starring at the wall as orders were piling up. Maybe he was just ovetwhelmed, either way its made for a bad experiance.   About 2 hours into lunch another sushi cutter comes frantically running in. It wasn't till he arrived that sushi started coming out.  Also the waiter and waitresses would walk away as you were trying to order. They would say that they had your order down as they walked away, however they would either forget items of bring out wrong items.   Food was 4 stars, service was 1 star. I decided to go with 3 over all stars. All negative critique aside I will give it another try. If the service is corrected I see 5 star potential.",

It was empty when we arrived but it was 11:30pm on a Tuesday during the pre holiday season when UNLV and most of vegas was slow  Pros: very clean, nice server, open late..  Cons:  Portion: while the Gyzoa was very fresh we couldn't fathom why am order for two people would only have 2 pieces( 1 for each). The gal I was super small and cut oddly   menu: it would be better if it had pictures...reading through the list as it was organized wasn't the easiest.  Subjective taste:  the sushi was not to my taste...I don't like cream cheese rolls and they had many... I wasn't a fan for the garlic ponzu sauce and their spicy tuna just wasn't to my taste.   So... Why a 3 star.. They were clean, good service and while the food wasn't to my sushi taste my friend liked hers and I have to round up on the subjective side",

The staff is attentive, the chefs personable, the environment soothing...don't get me started on the food.  Alright...  I'm a sushi fiend. And Sushi Way does NOT disappoint in the slightest. Their fish is fresh, their rice is the perfect texture. There is a balance between the fish and the rice, unlike many AYCE places that pile on the rice while minimizing cost by skimping on the fish portions.   I'll eat just about anything, so I love to ask the chefs what they like or to surprise me. To not be too terrible long-winded, I'll just say that you better get to this place ASAP!   They're new, so they aren't always packed, but when the word gets out and around...trust me. Sushi Way will be slammed 24/7 (well, when they're open). Love it! Gotta have it! This is the only Way to enjoy your sushi around the Strip and in the Vegas Metro area.",

Truly melt in your mouth delicious.  Other winners were the kamikaze dynamite, jalapeno poppers, wakame, and poke salad. I could easily eat this every day. Plus, the AYCE lunch is $21.95, a terrific value. Can't wait for my next yummy visit. Until then Sushi Way.",

We finally had a chance to meet and go here for lunch. We love sushi and were not real big on eating just rolls.  This place has a great selection not all just rolls but lots of items to choose from. We tried so many different things. The spicy tuna tare tar was so delicious as well as the salmon one, I was in heaven!! Everything seemed very fresh and all the fish was cut in nice pieces. They did not skimp on the portions of fish.  There were a few specials on the board we ordered to try and I highly recommend the boom boom special. What a taste and flavor. So many different textures , soft to chew but a little crunch to it with a sauce that I fell in love with! It had a light lemon flavor after taste but not over powering. I even tried eel for the first time! It wasn't bad! I really enjoyed everything and we had so much on our table I never got any pictures to share. I will for sure share pictures the next time we go which I hope is very soon again. We are big fans of Yama Sushi but I really think we found a new place we will go to more often.  Ended with some pineapple sorbet.   Over all I highly recommend everyone to try this place. My Yelp Friend was right! So happy he suggested this place!!! Looking forward to the next visit!!",

Most places you run into throw so much rice into their rolls you never get enough fish!   Not the case here!  Flavored were spot on.  My favorite roll of the night was the \"I Like My Ass\"!!  Yes indeed, soft shell crab that had great flavor a!  One of my tests for a new sushi joint is to see if they have fresh wasabi.  This is key in great sushi joint!  Ever since I was introduced to it by a very close friend and sushi chef it is the tell tale of a place in my book.  The attentiveness of the staff was bar none phenomenal!!    The all you can eat menu isn't limited on what you can get but rather how much you can devour in 60 minutes during lunch or 90 minutes during dinner!!!   Highly recommend you check out this new one!!  I think they will be around for awhile once the word is out!!  Thanks again for a pleasant eating experience on the road!!",

I informed them I was in a rush and it was apparently noted. I arrived 35 minutes later and they said \"no problem\" took my money and said the food would be right out. 10 minutes later, the food was nowhere to be seen. I asked again and was told they were just putting the food in a bag. 5 minutes later they informed me they hadn't even made my order. I asked for my money back and left hungry.",

They also take reservations by the way.  We have a group of 9 and our server Jane was so wonderful and accomating to us even for a big group and an indesivie family... our server was great!   Wr ordered so much food I can hardly remember what I ordered, I remember my favorites that were the sushi nachos, and the seared salmon.  I basically loved everything here including the green tea honey bread!",

It's rare to find awesome tempura batter that is light, crunchy, flavorful, and simple awesomeness!  Fantastic service, $9.95 lunch bento boxes, excellent food.  No wonder the ratings are so high!  Well done!",

    "text": "I was utterly disappointed with this place.  This is my second time at this place and it was a much different experience the first time.  I would have given it 4-5 stars the first visit but this second time was a very different experience.  We arrived for a 7:30pm reservation and got seated right away since it wasn't that crowded at all.  The place isn't that big of a place and only 4 tables were full when we got there so there was lots of empty tables.    Our waitress took our first round order of white tuna, salmon skin salads, salmon kama, uni and 3 other rolls.  It took a very long time for the first dishes to come out even though the place wasn't packed...then another person comes and says that he will be our waiter and that our orders will be out soon.  Then he comes back and says that they ran our of uni cause another party ordered all the rest of the uni.  We waited for over 15 mins from placing our order and then they tell us that there is no uni!...Hmmm.  The main reason I came was to experience the uni as I did the first time.    So we start to get our plates and they must have changed the Salmon skin salad cause it was not the same as before.  It was more like a wet salmon skin mix something...not too sure what it was.  It wasn't very tasty or appealing.  Most of the sushi rolls were decent to good and the salmon kama was actually really good.  So then we order another round of plates and they tell us they ran out of Kal bi or galbi as they call it on the menu.  So now the two most expensive things on the menu are out...okay.  The messed up part is that our waiter tells us that he's sorry but they ran out of Kalbi cause they got slammed with orders.  I looked at him and looked around at the half empty place and wondered how they got slammed with orders to run out when the place isn't even near full.  I thought he was actually joking at first but he was serious.  Keep in mind that this place is open till 2am and it was only 8:30pm.    We continue with a few more orders and then decide to get dessert and call it a night.  So we order the Fried Ice Cream, Green tea ice cream, and Yuzu.  The waiter comes back and says that they are our of Green Tea Ice cream and also can't make the Fried ice cream cause they don't have the Green Tea ice cream for it.  At this point I just had to laugh cause they ran out of each of the most expensive items on the menu.   So the lesson here is to make sure if you decide to go here, that they have the items you are most interested in and that AYCE only means it's AYCE of what they may have left.",

As I realized there was cramp, I had already eaten a bit because it resembled rice . So I had to immediately take a pill of my medicine to prevent an allergic attack .

Don't be scared when you hear this is All You Can Eat Sushi.  It's actually all made to order personally by the head sushi chef/owner.  There are many great items to try all for $26.95 for dinner.    You have 90 minutes and you can pick whatever you want from the menu.  Hot or Cold items, also anything on the daily special board which was amazing. I enjoyed the Salmon Belly Sushi, the White Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi.  From the main menu they have some fun rolls to try with their unique sauces like the I Love My Ass.  Service was top notch.  We were well taken care of, provided recommendations, and you will get very personalized service here.  Really friendly and the environment, food, drinks were all great.    They stay open until 1am on Sunday and 2am on other days.  I can't wait to come back and wish they were down here in the OC.  This is a great price for what you're going to get and the food is really good too.  I'm sure this place will be getting popular as you can already see all the rave reviews on Yelp.",

I came for the AYCE lunch special, which is $21.95, includes all rolls/sides; excludes sashimi. They have a decent little menu, and many options to choose from. There are a lot of baked and fried rolls here as well. Now, typically I wouldn't go for these types of rolls, but right now I have a strict \"no raw\" fish rule in place because of health reasons. So, I was really craving sushi, and noticed Sushi Way had numerous options that would fit my needs.  The sushi chefs are very nice, as are the servers. Most of my sushi and sides arrived quickly, and I was asked if I wanted more sushi when I was almost complete with each of the rolls I had in front of me.   I won't list off all the rolls I ate here, but I had 4, as well as two different sides. I was very pleased with the meal, and I would certainly return for another visit.",

Our waitress was the best! Didn't catch her name, but she was super on top of things- refills, taking away plates, etc. She was awesome (and Korean, like us :] ). The sushi chefs were extremely attentive and made great sushi. The fish was fresh and plentiful. They didn't skimp at all on the fish to rice ratio. Not everyone enjoys this, but the sesame seeds were a different thing from my usual and I liked it.  Warning; the tartare has a bed of artificial crab meat in the bottom.

I love the waitress, she's prompt and a sweet heart; however, I'm not paying someone $28 to do so where my dog gives that to me for free.  The sushi is average.  Their orgasm appetizer doesn't even tickle me.  The best dish there is the coconut shrimp tempura which comes from a box either way.  How are they 4.5 stars you ask?  People want a free soda so they give them 5 stars.  Really people?  Your integrity for $2.50 worth of coke?  Highly disappointed.  Here are other recommendations if you're looking for ayce sushi in Las Vegas:  Sakana Jjanga Yama (hit or miss)",

The service was great, and the quality of the nigiri was great! Except the uni and oysters. I would NOT recommend those.   We all did the AYCE dinner for $26.95. The atmosphere is a bit dim lit. And just a heads up, they include an 18% gratuity charge for groups larger than six. We also called ahead to check on the wait time, and there wasn't a wait on a Saturday night so our hangry butts immediately headed over.   As soon as we got there, we placed orders for salmon nigiri, fresh water eel nigiri, fresh oysters (DON'T GET THESE), baked mussels (don't recommend these either), udon (this was good!), miso soup, garlic edamame (DANK!!), mackerel, uni (it was an oddly creamy texture), halibut nigiri, yellow nigiri, and some rolls.  Overall, it's an average AYCE sushi spot. It's most definitely not the best I've ever had but also not the worst. Great service though!",

    "text": "Sushi Way is my go-to neighborhood AYCE sushi bar. It may not have the best sushi all the time, but it satisfies my cravings and I'm always able to get in without having to wait 1-2 hours unlike Goyemon or Kaya. I believe lunch is $22 and dinner is $27. Like most AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas, you get a few extra premium items with the dinner price such as the uni, oysters, sweet shrimp, as well as galbi and the screaming orgasm. They always have daily specials, which has always included a type of sashimi with jalapenos. In the past, this has included the super white tuna and yellowtail.   The best things to order at Sushi Way include the nigiri and a few of the side dishes. I've never had a bad experience with any of the fish. I tend to stay away from the regular or specialty rolls as they usually have a ton of rice and cream cheese. However, if you are tempted to try one, they do offer half rolls. Some of my favorite side dishes include the coconut shrimp tempura (must order every visit), baked green mussels, bacon scallop skewer, and seaweed salad. Of the specialty rolls, I've only tried a few variations of the soft shell crab for fun.   Their dessert menu includes green tea ice cream, yuzu sorbet, mochi, tempura ice cream, and honey bread. I usually stick to the green tea ice cream or strawberry mochi. The tempura becomes complete mush and the yuzu sorbet is too icey. Don't forget to check-in on the Yelp app for a free soda. They do have time limits for meals, but I've never experienced them enforcing the rules.",

    "text": "Not sure where to go with this since the pics of my food look dope and the service was spot on...  but...  ...something seemed up with the wateriness of some of the sushi, almost like there was a condensation problem going on in the fridge and some water collected in the tray. A lot of the pieces seemed just wet, even my girlfriend noticed and mentioned so it wasn't just in my head or something. The salmon wasn't totally fresh and neither was the red snapper...and they were out of halibut...bummer. Also, they seared a lot of the pieces even though I'm not into searing it (hence why people go for sushi...uncooked fish, right!?)...maybe they were trying to cover up something.  Anyway with all that above, why 4 stars instead of 3 (or less). The service was great, it wasn't busy and we had a ton of \"no rice\" arrangements thrown at us left and right made up on the spot that seemed limitless (see pics)...and oh yeah...Tempura. Coconut. Shrimp.  This place came recommended from a couple AYCE sushi fans and I can see it has potential.   Perhaps I'll give them another shot to earn that 5...(if Sakana has an hour wait).",

The AYCE is $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner. We came for dinner at 6:00 PM on a Friday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy but there were enough customers to know it wasn't a terrible place. You can order any of their menu items for the AYCE and the best part is that you can order half rolls! I would recommend the raw oysters, baked green mussels, and galbi. Of course, complete your dinner with one of their dessert items (included in the AYCE)!",

Most places that do AYCE have a limited menu, not here, everything was on the menu!  I sat at the bar and got great service . a lot of the nigiri that i tried had some small tweaks that made it that much better.  Will come here again next time i am in town. my new favorite place!",

I always prefer to sit at the bar, and since the place was empty, i was surprised that we were basically forced to a table.   We all ordered the all you can eat lunch, which at 21.95 is worth it, since that is the cost of about 2 rolls. I love nigiri as well, so the value was definitely there.  All the food was decent and came out very quickly (since we were the only ones there).  When the nigiri came out, if multiple people ordered the same, it all came out on the same plate.   The food tasted fresh, and looked appetizing when it came out. This place would have gotten five stars except that we were forced to sit at tables instead of the bar.",

In the land of buffets, only the specialized that know what they're doing reigns supreme. For lunch , it was $22 and omg we kept ordering and ordering roll after roll after nigiri, its so cool to try everything if you wish; be forewarned ! DO NOT OVER ORDER, they CLEARLY STATE:  YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR WASTING FOOD, and leftovers, EVEN RICE! Luckily, we didn't go nuts and we had the opportunity to try a lot of the rolls and nigiris.  They also serve izakaya food with a variety of beers, sakes. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE how amazing this place is.. I've been to many a few sushi buffets around vegas, and regular sushi restaurants; when it comes to price and freshness and exclusivity of certain curated rolls, this places is hands down one of the best. We literally broke even for lunch after the 3rd roll . The rolls they made do not seem like your normal tossed together cheaply made rolls. They're creative, like the sunrise roll, with sliced citrus over salmon.  The regular spider roll. just to name a few.  The seared tuna, the garlic tuna was very well paired, not too salty and flavorful. The bottom line is the fish is fresh, the staff are really nice and friendly, they are attentive to you needing more sushi. My second time was to make sure i REALLY love this place, and sure enough, i still do. They also do a frequent visitor stamp card! so umm heck yeah!.. Go and try it for yourself!",

Walking in, this definitely has that typical sushi restaurant feel with a bar. The waitress immediately sat us down and provided menus to my buddy and I. We didn't even have to wait long to get her to take our orders either. It's like she had Psychic powers because she was always on top of her game serving us when checking if we need anything.  Sorry Richard, we got ourselves a waitress who knows how to keep her customers happy lol. She strikes up a conversation on her free time to make our experience a lot better for not only the food, but the welcoming personality. A+ for her service!!   My friend definitely showed me great expectations for their Sushi and fusion specialties. We did AYCE for $26 and got free drinks for writing a review/rating them on yelp. Ask about their stamp cards. When you get 10, next visit is free.  Don't forget to try their tempura ice cream and there's no limit to trying each of their desserts. Usually most Sushi restaurants only limit you to one dessert per customer...   Take a look at my photos to see all the delicious food I had.",

You can also order half roll what is perfect when you want to try different things. The price is reasonable compared to what you can find in Las Vegas.  Other suggestions: Dragon roll, shrimp lover.",

    "text": "So my friends and I decided to try this place on a whim and we were not disappointed. When we got there there was no hostess to seat us so I was a little confused. One of the sushi chefs waved us in and a waitress asked if we wanted a booth or to sit at the bar. Since there were four of us we asked for a booth. The waitress told us to take the one in the corner, instead of leading us to the booth...a little weird, but she wasn't unfriendly so I didn't mind.  They brought us all water, but I don't remember whether or not they asked if we wanted something else to drink...again not a problem because I only drink water (in their defense they may have asked but I wasn't paying attention as I already had my nose to the menu trying to pick out what to try first).  The waitress was super patient with us as none of us had ever been there before and we all said we needed a couple minutes to pick out our rolls. Of course we were all doing the AYCE because the dinner was only $26.95 which is pretty good for a dinner price. Once we got our first round in the food came out really fast which was also shocking because I ordered baked mussels and a fried roll. I also ordered the salmon killer roll which was just a bunch of salmon. Somewhere along the way, one of the sushi chefs misheard an order and made an extra roll and the waitress gave it to us because she said if we didn't want it then it was just going to go in the trash and I don't like to waste food so that was awesome that we got that extra roll! (I mean I know it's AYCE, but still...it's something we probably wouldn't have picked it for ourselves). For the second round I was already getting kind of full so I ordered some uni nigiri (which was some of the freshest uni I have ever had), and the sushi solution roll (also insanely delicious). For dessert we all had fried bananas with vanilla ice cream. Everything we had was just so good that now we've decided to make this our new sushi spot to eat even though three of us live in Henderson!!!  It did shock us all that it really wasn't busy when we got there. We knew that this restaurant had a 4.5 star review on here. It turns out that this place's happy hour starts at 9pm so the place got pretty crowded right before 9. This restaurant also has a stamp card where when you buy 10 AYCE meals, you get the next one free which is just awesome for a sushi lover like me!",

Great thing is, the dessert items are unlimited too, so fill up to your heart's desire--other nice items include deep fried ice cream or mochi.  This is a great sushi spot, I'll definitely be back again.",

This is the first and only all you can eat spot I have tried in Vegas and I fell in love instantly! With that being said, the interior of the restaurant is a average size spot. They have an L shaped sushi bar which holds maybe 15 people or so. They also have a decent amount of seating throughout the establishment as well. Every time I've eaten here everything seems as fresh as it can be from a all you can eat spot. I have never gotten sick eating here. The sushi chefs also will surprise you with items off menu if you strike up some conversation with them. After all they are humans too and want some social interaction at work! haha I have tried soooo many sushi and rolls from here that I can't describe everything I have ever ordered. All I can say is that if you're in Las Vegas and feeling super hungry and want sushi, I would give Sushi Way a try! I was never disappointed!",

I am a pretty patient person but I started getting uncomfortable and embarrassed just only having drinks and nothing to eat in front of me for so long.  Even with nothing on our table the staff didn't bother checking in with us to see if we got our orders or wanted anything. To make matters worse it was a birthday dinner for my partner and I felt awful.   I won't go back to this place.  I don't normally review places but the service here was just so bad and a waste of time.  If you do go here you'll probably enjoy the food but just make sure they don't forget about you.",

My girlfriend does not eat raw seafood so we ordered bento dinner for her. We waited at least an hour for her bento box. If I had not flagged the server to ask for it, it probably would not have arrived. I was already halfway through my course when her dinner was placed in front of her. Gladly, she enjoyed the food aside from the shitty service. Unfortunately, my all you can eat dinner was an unpleasant event. The amateur chef loaded my nigiri with fat portion of rice. The ratio was about 3 to 1.  Fish was cut so thin it looked like paper. I felt that he was trying to get me full fast so we can get the hell outta there. My kitchen order came quicker than the sushi that I ordered first. This tells ya how slow this so called chef was. By the time I asked for the check the chef had a disgusting smirk on his face. I'd probably give them a bit of slack if it was super busy but it was a slow steady night during our visit. Save your money and go somewhere else. I will never come to this place.",

Even though it was a full house, we started getting our food within 10 minutes of ordering. We never had an empty cup, nor empty plates piling up. This is one of the few all you can eat sushi restaurants in Vegas that have exceeded my expectations. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town.",

The all you can eat was a great price (like $26 something I think per person for dinner), and it includes everything (except drinks), not just sushi! We also got miso soup and ice cream. The green tea ice cream, sorbet, and mango Mochi were all delicious! As well as all the sushi we got. The miso soup was great - not too salty, but definitely not bland.  What really put this place over the top though was the service. Everyone was so nice there! Like they're usually nice at most restaurants, but at this place they seemed genuinely friendly and happy that we were there. And they were right on top of everything. I've had all you can eat where the sushi took forever to come out. Not this place. Probably because they bring the sushi out as it's made, not necessarily all together. Some might not like that, but I really did. I'm really glad we chose this place over the other sushi places in the area!",

I can't believe it has taken me so long to write this review (I've been here about 25 times already) but after the FREE travel chopsticks offer how I could I pass it up. Let's start out with the atmosphere. It's fantastic, cozy, yet modern and staff is among the friendliest. Let's not forget to mention the Spotify playlist that just hits the SPOT. Now getting into the sushi well let's just say you're going to pay half of what the strip charges you and get 3x the quality and uniqueness. While all of the sushi chefs are fantastic I must brag about Ivan. He's a one of a kind sushi chef who will not hesitate to make you some of his custom rolls. In the end Sushi way has friendly service, great food, and at a great price.. What's not to love?",

We ordered one specific roll but got two, talked to a lady about it she said it was fine to just take it to go.

    "text": "You want a new sushi spot (opened for about only a month now) that serves great quality sushi in an all-you-can-eat format?  Go this 'way' ... the Sushi Way!   Let's preface by saying that my all-time favorite ayce sushi spot currently is Sakana but Sushi Way may take the top spot in the future.  If you were a big fan of Sakana then when I say this rivals them, you ought to hurry before this place gets too popular.  It was that good my first time here and I can only hope it'll stay this way when I return again soon.  The location takes over where once Dragonfly/Firefly used to be way back then.  So many good memories made here and I'm glad a new sushi joint has taken its place.  My group walked in around 6pm on a Monday and we were the only customers there.  Sweet.  More attention for us.  Free drink with Yelp or Facebook check-in. Nice!  Thirsts quenched.    Onto the food:    Appetizers- Gyoza, Fried Rice (w/ chicken), Tempura Shrimp and Tempura Coconut Shrimp, Seaweed Salad, Poke Tuna, Baked Mussels, Miso Soup, and Sweet and Spicy Dumpling.  Everything was great but the Poke and the Baked Mussels were REAAALLLY Good.     Check out my beautiful pictures..  so fresh, nice color, tasted marvelously.  My daughter and I enjoyed the seaweed salad and the tempura shrimp in unlimited quantities is reason enough to be eating here.   There were multiple other choices on the menu that we didn't get to try simply because it was just the three of us eating.  (oysters, yakitori skewers, etc.)  Sushi- Japanese Lasagna-  California roll with cream cheese baked with yumyum sauce on top.  Assorted regular rolls such as shrimp tempura rolls, rainbow roll, etc.  All rolled well, nothing fell apart and the taste was good.   The screaming orgasm came with nice thick pieces of tuna in that delicious tangy screaming O sauce.  We had assorted nigiri including salmon, yellowtail and garlic tuna.  The fish was fresh and the ratio of fish to rice was excellent.    I did also get one order of uni and it was super fresh!  When the uni is fresh, it's as good as it gets for me.    Also, note on one of my pictures, if there's a roll you're interested in that's not on the menu, there's a \"create your own roll\" option.  They will try to make it for you.  Thought that was cool.  With regards to the service, the staff was very welcoming and attentive.  Waters were filled within reasonable time and the food came out quickly.  Only time can tell whether this place will be able to handle a packed restaurant once word-of-mouth continues to bring new customers in here.  Until then, stop by ASAP and enjoy some great quality AYCE sushi!",

If you're going to get two rolls or a roll and an app, all you can eat value is hands down the way to go. We ate at the sushi bar and the chef \"Mike\" was the kindest and most helpful sever I have encountered in a long time. He recommended some great dishes staring with apps to rolls and dessert. When you mention that you are getting full he is so accommodating by splitting rolls into smaller plates so you can try a little of everything. Definitely will come back next time I'm in town!",

Sushi Way met all these criteria - stopped in for lunch with the family and left completely satisfied.  We ordered a wide variety of sushi and roles, and had no complaints on any of them.  The kids even special ordered their miso soups (one with no seaweed or onions, the other with no tofu) and they even nailed those orders.  Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "Tonight I had THE most...\"spiritual\" experience in a long time. And of all things with food, and my gift of a sushi chef. Meet \"Mike\", a 67 year old sushi master who grew up as a pineapple farmer in Hawaii.   I could tell you I only ordered one thing off of the menu. That after that, we began talking and he learned I appreciated authentic sushi, with minimal flavoring, much more than the hyper saturated \"American sushi\". That for the rest of the night not a single thing I ate came off the menu, but was custom made to fit my palette and preferences. But none of that does the night justice.  As soon as we began talking he began imparting wisdom along with every dish he gracefully handed to me. As though to feed my soul along with my stomach. He learned I was a photographer and most everything he said thereafter he tied into photography or what he knew of me. I wish I had recorded everything he said (he reminded me of my grandfather), but I will do my best to paraphrase the many things he shared with me:  \"Say...hundred cooks learn to make one dish. But maybe only 20 learn to make it another way. Just like photography. One subject. All photographers take one picture. But you see one thing and you see ten things. Ten angles. You make ten things out of one thing. This is cooking.\"  \"People grow up eating fast. Fast food. We don't think about what we eat we just eat it. We don't think about life we just live it fast. Then we get old. Then we think about what we eat but it is too late. We think about how we live but it is too late. Slow down. Eat slow. Live slow. Appreciate everything slowly. Enjoy.\"  \"Beauty...beauty is an interesting thing. Beauty leads to jealousy. Jealousy leads to anger. Anger leads to hurting people. We must not hurt people. We must see beauty and appreciate.\"  \"Don't do something you don't like. Love what you do. Find what you love and use it to make other people happy.\"  \"You work hard, you come here and I take care of you. You relax. You enjoy. I like to make people smile.\"  \"We can't just hear. We must understand. I say something to you. Tell me what I said. Understand it. If you don't understand it you did not hear it. Don't hear what people say. Hear ideas.\"   COME HERE!",

The first roll was somewhat edible since it was only half drenched so I used napkins to take off the exceeds and just ate it since I hadn't eaten all day and was starving. Even then I couldn't finish the first roll. The second roll was just disgusting. It looked like a dark brown roll with an avocado on top. Sauce was dripping down from it when I picked it up. So I sent it back.  I complained to both the chef and the waiter but they did not do anything and still charged me for both rolls. I understand sometimes the food and the wait staff are not in sync so I usually let it go, but I spoke with both parties with no result. I'm very disappointed with the experience.  TL;DR - ordered caterpillar rolls that took a bath in eel sauce. Complained to chef and server, still got charged for everything.",

I give the servers 3 stars cuz they were very attentive and gave good suggestions, although our order taker started to give attitude cuz I ordered 3 times, I mean I paid for a buffet you gotta expect that as a server. Anyways I would not suggest going here, place is kinda beat up, smells dirty, food is blah, service is ok, and I question the freshness of their product. You gotta know \"you get what you pay for\".

Sit at the bar and be able to constantly order directly with the sushi chefs. Hand rolls are a definite recommendation over cuts. Be sure to order all the \"one-time\" items, you're welcome! Oysters are great. Exactly like the shooters but on the half shell. And who wouldn't like to exclaim, \"Can I have a screaming orgasm, please?!\" Only complaint is that the uni and sweet shrimp didn't taste as fresh. And the spicy garlic edamame wasn't exactly what I was expecting from a Japanese restaurant. But everything else was delicious though!  Friendly staff and quick service. Restrooms are clean.

The real issue was their two servers had NO IDEA how to take our orders by section. We were split up into three sections (left side, middle, and right side) as the food was coming out, the servers quickly named the food item and didn't take the time to actually see who ordered it but laid it down anywhere on the table. The birthday boy was unfortunately sitting in the middle of the table, which got absolutely NO FOOD for almost an hour. After checking up on the server TWICE, the other sections of our table received their THIRD order of food. Yet, we were still waiting for our FIRST.   Absolutely terrible service, I have never been so frustrated with a sushi place before until now. Their servers need to prioritize which food is going where and not blindly putting it wherever. The worst part is that they still charged us an 18% gratuity that they didn't deserve. I'm also in the food industry and this is not how service should be handled.  Never coming back here again.",

The rolls are always good and they have a huge variety on the menu. Lots of tables and never overly crowded. I haven't been to Sushi Way in a while. I thought I'd give it a go. I decided to try different rolls and did the all you can eat. I I like that they offer half rolls. I started out with the spicy edamame and it was really good and hot. Most of the rolls seem to be tempura and are pretty similar. I like the crunch roll #2 with calamari instead of shrimp. My favorite was the kiss a fire roll. It was hot. It had jalapenos and hot sauce. This is still one of my favorite sushi places in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Good AYCE sushi spot. They have a good selection of specialty rolls, nigiri, and appetizers. There's a few items that are only available during dinner rather than lunch, such as sweet shrimp, which kind of sucks not to have during lunch but if that's the only difference between lunch and dinner, it's not a big deal. I would have liked to see more options for hand rolls though. Especially with AYCE, I prefer to have smaller portions of an item rather than a big roll so hand rolls are perfect, plus it's less wasteful especially if you feel it's too hard to finish a whole roll (which by the way they charge for leftovers which is typical but also charge for leftover rice). But overall each roll and appetizer I ordered was fresh and tasty. Their dessert options included honey bread which is toast with honey and ice cream..so good! Never seen that on any other AYCE menu so that was a plus.",

My poor girlfriend got so sick she couldn't walk, she was depleted of all of her nutrients due to the nature of food poisoning I won't go into detail as you likely know the symptoms.   She got so dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea we decided she needed to go to the hospital. We called the restaurant to advise them and the girl at the front desk had the owner call within minutes.   The owner said \"oh no, this has happened before. Take her to the hospital and my insurance will take care of it\" we took her to the hospital where she sat for 5-7 hours and received fluids to replenish her nutrients and hydration.   The hospital diagnosed her with food poisoning and the owner apologized over and over saying the insurance will take care of everything. When we finally got with the insurance company the adjuster was a bully, rude and began to retract the owners statement on his behalf.   Long story short they stuck her with a $3,500 hospital bill and didn't take care of anything they promised to handle. The also promised to reimburse the meal and didn't.   Sushi way is filled with food born illness. DO NOT EAT HERE!",

We did Ayce and the person helping us rarely checked in with us when this place only had maybe 3 other tables there, we even had to get the busboy to help us. Getting sushi out for us took 20-30 minutes at a time. The Nigiri fish to rice ratio was a very small portion of fish for lots of rice. Everything about our experience here put us to never want to return.",

The server was alone and it was actually a little bit busy for late night and for one server on the floor. But she was on point, she was running around taking care of every table and us. So I can't wait to go back at a different time and have an even better service when she's not so busy. She also knew the menu well and was friendly.  We ordered our usuals and they were better than most places which we noticed right away. All the sashimi we had was fresh and flavorful. All the fried appetizers we had were great. Nothing was over sauced or over done. Really; the food was fantastic.",

There are few places far and wide who are able to offer their costumers an all you can eat menu without limiting the individuals to certain roles and quality. Not this place. you literally have the whole freaking menu at your will to devour without hesitation. COME WITH AN APPETITE. Time is your only enemy as this amazing deal has restrictions of 1 hour for lunch and 90 minutes for dinner. But that is more than enough time to eat 7-8 rolls each.",

The appetizers were good and what I love the most about this place is that they offer great variety of delicious rolls, ordered as a full roll or half roll! My fave place in town do not allow us to order half rolls so I never got to try a variety of rolls and usually stick with the nigiri but now I can! Besides the food, the service was good and the place is clean (which is pretty important in my book!). This place has definitely become one of my top AYCE sushi restaurants. I will definitely frequent this place more, despite living in the other side of town!",

We all got AYCE and ordered a shit ton on our first round and the server got everything down with ease and no mistakes were found when our orders came through.   The place was fairly crowded but the three servers all worked together to get everything done quickly. I'm pretty sure I experienced the best customer service ever here so I'm very impressed. The three girls were very attentive to every customer and made sure we had no issues with anything. Whenever we asked for extras like more ginger etc. they promptly did so without showing irritation. I get that being a server isn't the best job out there, but as the millennial I am, I feel bad constantly asking serves to do their job lol and it was nice not to feel like a burden. I didn't have to ask for anything twice (god forbid) and they were all just sweethearts about everything.   The atmosphere of the place itself was nice. It was fairly calm and not too big. It is a spacious but cozy place. Definitely a new go to spot for sushi in Vegas.",

Since I don't like to waste food, I said I can eat it to be nice and she said nothing. Seriously??  AND she said I can't order my favorite Alaskan rolls without crab! Even after I told her I have crab allergy, she said I can reduce the amount of crab but I \"have to\" eat it!! She laterally said that!!! WTF???Seriously???? Even tho you guys say on the menu that you guys would make a custom roll???? So what if I ask you to make a roll with salmon, cucumber,and avocado? Would I still have to eat it with crab??? Lame.   After I said then forget it, she asked the chef and he said he can make it w/o crab( of course! Why not?) But I never expected to be told to eat something I am allergic to in any restaurants so I was so shocked! Also, in almost all the restaurants(as far as I know), they  normally don't put crab meat in Alaskan rolls anyway!!!   Also when we went to have a lunch there, it was almost empty but each order took about 10-15 min to come!!! So ridiculous!!!! I really wanted to love this place but I can't. I don't think I will never go back there. They are Korean so they don't know how to make sushi and cut fish right. But their fish quality was actually good for ayce, so If the service was better, I would give them another chance, but never! I will never go back to the restaurant that tells me to eat what I physically can't. Or unless she leaves the restaurant, or they train her right!!",

Their waiters are super friendly and it's definitely one of the best AYCE in town, and I've done AYCE on just about every side of town.  The last few times it's been a bit inconsistent with sushi chefs that change every single time and when I get nigiri the fish temperature is almost room temperature instead of chilled as it should be. The food is still good, but the rolls have been more inconsistent since every time we go it's different sushi chefs that don't seem to have as much training. If the fish were chilled properly and the rice to fish ratio were consistent between chefs I think this would be a 5 star review. I do love that they offer punch cards which gives you a great incentive to keep coming back!",

    "text": "This is an all-you-can-eat sushi place for about $25/head. The restaurant wasn't that big, but it was clean. We got the last booth on a Saturday night. Not a fancy establishment...some people brought their kids & infants.  The selection of items was tremendous. Some of the item names are, ahem, not family-friendly. \"Excuse me, uh, what is a Screaming Orgasm?\" Lol!  Quality of the fish was okay, perhaps slightly better than average for sushi buffet. Note: there's no way we can compare sushi buffet fish with a regular restaurant, given the relatively low cost. The seaweed salad was too sweet.  So, why did DH swear never to return? It was the rice. Their rice was gluey and starchy, so much so that it distracted us from enjoying the fish or shrimp. The  sweet shrimp itself was pretty good, however, they didn't give us the deep fried heads! The uni was a touch bitter & a really small portion. It was okay, but we didn't want more. Which was a good thing, since this item was limited to one order per person.  The Kalbi was good. Haha, must be a Korean-run establishment! :) Eel was okay, but no torch-caramelized top. Sunny Special roll tasted fine, however, not as skillfully done as the nigiri. They had more than 1 chef making rolls, so maybe these were done by the other guy. See the photo with the cross-section on how it was rolled.  The \"Yum Scallop\" was basically a gunkan sushi with shredded scallop mixed in mayonnaise. We couldn't understand the waitress & thought \"mai yu\" was a special seasoning! Lol! She meant \"mayo\"! You folks can pass on this one. ;)  The Honey Bread dessert was tasty. Basically a King's Hawaiian bread roll with a scoop of green tea ice cream, whipped cream, and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. I don't think there was any honey in it. DH tried the yuzu sorbet and the flavor was weak.  Service was surprisingly good. They get an extra star for that. The wait staff was eager to get our orders in & happily explained things on the menu. There is a 90 minute time limit for dinner, but we were never rushed. Food came out quickly.",

Started with miso soup which is always a great start to a meal.  Followed by teriyaki chicken appetizer  Golden Philly roll - filled with cream cheese and deep fried .... melts right in your mouth warm and creamy!!  Big Easy Special - HUGE!  Very flavorful  Spicy tuna roll - always nice to go back to sample simplicity    From beginning to finish was less than 1 hour.  Service was quick and fantastic!    Great late night find off the strip!  Located within a shopping center.  No expensive overhead to cover so definitely reasonable in price!    I will most likely visit again on my next trip",

Our waiter was awesome - very nice and attentive.  Really liked everything but our orders were taking so long. We were waiting 10-15 minutes each time we asked for another dish. Unacceptable. Main reason for the slow down is because the owner and her friends or family came in and demanded priority. All efforts went into catering to the owner. Not cool. And what kind of business owner does that?! We just kept watching dish after dish coming out for their table while we were waiting and waiting.  Also, they have gotten pretty busy but they only have two sushi chefs. Doesn't seem like enough.   To end our meals, we got two orders of the honey bread. It was tasty but it's not real honey bread. It's just a small piece of Hawaiian Roll with honey, ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup.",

Unlike other places, they don't skim on the fish when its All You Can Eat .  They make the rolls just like they would if you were ordering by the roll.  The fish quality is fresh and the rolls, nigiri, and all other items are made with care.  There's many other places I've been to that the roll falls apart even before you pick them up off the plate.  Never had a problem here as everything is prepared and made well.  I always try to order a different combination of sushi nigiri and rolls every time I visit.  Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a nice clean and tasty all you can eat sushi restaurant =)",

I wasn't a fan of the bacon wrapped scallops, they were a bit slimy even though they were cooked. The pork belly was good. I don't think the Uni was very fresh either. Overall is was fine... average quality I assume. Although I eat a lot of sushi so I'm very picky. Service was good as well. My only real complaint is the AYCE pricing seemed high to me. I know this is vegas but for the quality of the fish I wouldn't go back with these same prices in place.",

Normally it tastes like the ocean but if you ask anybody that has eaten good uni, they will tell you that it tastes like butter and over it tasted like butter. Even my brother and my dad who has high end taste likes it here.    One thing to note is the things with the red dot at the end of it (uni aka sea urchin, ama ebi aka sweet shrimp, fresh oyster, Kal bi aka galbi, etc) is one order per person. Other than that it order as much as you can eat. Don't waste or you might get charged.   They have beer, different kinds of sake, soft drinks, and soda.   Desserts are things like mochi ice cream, green tea ice cream, yuzu sorbet, tempura ice cream, and honey bread. Unfortunately you can choose only one of them.   Yuna was our server and she was the bomb. Very friendly and gave us some good suggestions. Thanks Yuna, everything you suggested was good.   Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95.   For all of you who cant eat that much, you can do Ala carte.",

Miss Jane was our waitress and couldn't have been more fortunate to have her. Unlike many other sushi servers, she would stop by each table to engage with her customers which made her very approachable. I asked her for more pickled ginger and she came back with a bowl full! Now that's the kind of woman I need in my life Lol.  As far as the food, I stuck to my favorites from my last visit and the quality is still there: Big Easy Roll, Kiss of Fire Roll, Bacon Wrapped Scallops, Super White Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Sushi Nachos, Coconut Tempura, Oysters, Baked Muscles, Pork Belly, Tempura Ice Cream, Mochi Ice Cream (no limit on desserts).   Thank you to all the chefs backstage for preparing our food and of course Jane for putting up with our immature personalities.

We searched and searched, and there weren't a ton of inexpensive sit-down options that were nearby. However, after about 20-30 minutes of searching on Yelp, he saw the menu for Sushi Way--at $10-15, the prices sounded great, and the place had 4.5 stars.  We sat down and picked two sushi rolls to start--when the server came to take our order, we told him what we wanted, and then he asked if we wanted to do the AYCE sushi option for $27 a person. There were a couple rules to review on the menu (like they will charge you for wasting food), but I LOVE sushi and knew that I could eat my money's worth. Any stomach ache or vomiting from overeating would be totally worth it. That's how much I love sushi.  I ordered oysters, baked mussels, seared salmon, salmon, eel, sea urchin, sexy lazy special, vocano roll, pineapple sorbet, and vanilla ice cream. Everything was SO good. I loved the sexy lazy, vocano, and eel the most. I still dream about those flavors in my mouth. Oh, it was SO good. None of the sushi had excessive rice, they were super friendly, quick, and paced everything out well instead of dragging it out so you're full faster.  I definitely wish this place was in Portland. I would probably go eat myself stupid at least once a month. At least.",

This place had pretty good reviews so we stopped by Saturday night around 8pm. Despite the great reviews, the place was pretty empty - not sure if it was a good or bad sign (no clue when the Vegas dinner rush hours are) but I was starving so I took it as a good sign.   AYCE is $22 for lunch and $27 for dinner. The menu is pretty huge and also has a good variety of cooked stuff. Can't compare to other AYCE sushi Vegas places since we weren't local.   The good: - Service was amazing! Not sure if it is because it was half empty but props to their team - plus the food came out super fast  - The fish didn't taste fishy. The fish to rice ratio is a little higher than I would prefer...I would say that it is average. The uni and sweet shrimp was super tasty.   The meh: - Don't get their oysters...it was way sauced up and didn't look terribly fresh - Don't get their Galbi/Kalbi: super chewy  - Their rolls / Sushi Nachos were way too saucy. Would not recommend   Stick with their nigiri and don't get any of the cooked stuff or rolls. This place is 3.5, rounded down because I'm a little weary of places that offer free stuff (in this case - a soda) for reviews (that you have to show on the spot).

Sushi Way is tucked into the Corporate Center in Vegas near all the other food choices. The service was excellent and the waitress/staff were all incredibly attentive. The food that came out was fresh, and tasted great (see all the photos of goodness in the review)! The lunch AYCE price was $21.95 I believe, and had pretty much everything on the menu up for grabs.  All-in-all, very good spot to stuff yourself silly. Be warned though, DO NOT WASTE FOOD. I think every household (including you who are currently reading this) has been scolded by your family as a youngin'. If you do it here, you will be charged.",

The vibe is hip and trendy, with Eminem rap music bumping through the speakers and high-speed skating on the TV screens. Food was ready extremely fast, and everything was amazing.   I've never had deep-fried sushi before, and my Johnny roll was awesome!! I would've eaten two! We also got two other sushi rolls and the vegetable tempura. Tons of options on the menu, and lots of them were very different from what I'm used to back home in New England. Lots of great new things to try!  Sushi Way does have an \"all you can eat\" option, but the a la carte menu is what we went with, and I was happy with my decision.",

    "text": "Did the AYCE. Being that I live in a non-sushi kind of place, sushi is the one thing I have to have when I go to Vegas. Because I want to get more than one piece, I like to go off Strip for my fix. This was a new choice, and I was not disappointed.   The boyfriend and I did the all you can eat, getting the nigiri first: super tuna, scallops, salmon, and yellowtail. All were fresh, with nice, properly seasoned rice and reasonable portions, with the scallop being the stand out (I think I had six pieces total). For the rolls, they allow you to get half and half if you're torn between two choices, as I was with the Alaska and Arizona rolls, and again, great sizes, super fresh, and tasty combos (I preferred the Alaska with the crab, but that's just personal taste).   Also got the Salmon Tartar, which is quite rich, served as a round with a top layer of salmon tartar, a lower layer of mayo/crab, and a creamy mayo sauce. The shrimp tempura was light and not greasy. The only disappointment was the tempura ice cream, with a heavy, unappealing shell over the green tea ice cream. But it was such a minor fault (and I really wasn't there for dessert) that I don't care.   The sushi chef was super friendly and very on the ball, he almost seemed disappointed when we stopped ordering (even though I thought we'd been kind of piggish). Overall, a very satisfying experience.",

We ordered pretty much everything from the raw oysters to the nigiri to rolls. The nigiri and rolls were good, salmon, tuna, eel, yellowtail all the standard stuff were on point. The only thing that was less favorable was the raw oysters. Nonetheless, a pretty solid sushi place!",

    "text": "Overall, it was an alright meal, but looking back at reviews and pictures, it seems the cut of fish I received was inconsistent with others.. Came for an early dinner on Saturday and was really looking forward to our meal after a hike in the narrows. We chose to sit at the sushi bar and service was decent.  For apps: the coconut shrimp tempura and baked green mussels were good. The calamari was not so great. Not crunchy and the batter came right off.  In our first round, we ordered 2 orders of uni, but was only brought out 1. So I had to ask for the second. When they brought out the second order, there was significantly less uni. I was dismayed but the uni was still very good.   It seemed after our first round, the sushi chef wasn't happy that I asked for the second uni order and it was reflected on the size of fish and rice we got following that order. The cuts of our fish for the nigiri were small compared to the pictures, and the amount of rice got a little bigger. The rice also fell apart too easily.  I did enjoy the white tuna the best, it came with a garlic ponzu, and the fish was really good. It'd be even better with a better fish to rice ratio. Garlic yellowtail was also good. Everything else was so so: salmon, garlic tuna, scallop.  The sweet shrimp was nice and big in size, but the sushi chef did not include the fried shrimp head, nor did he offer or say anything about it.  The Red Boy roll: this was good, the white tuna on top was a little cooked on top, and the charred flavor went really well.  The I love my ass roll: not so good.. There was supposed to be soft shell crab inside, but there was literally none, just a lot of imitation crab filling.  The yellowtail collar and jalapeno white tuna were the chef's special for the day. The yellowtail was huge and delicious, although a bit overcooked. Also liked the white tuna.",

My dining guest does not eat sushi.... sadly... however, he did have some amazing pot stickers as well as some tasty katsu chicken; so there is something on the menu for our non sushi eating friends.  Here is a tip as well....... you can order half sizes of the rolls! If you are anything like me you want to try as much as your sushi tummy can handle! Also, beer drinking is fun, but it does have a tendency to make that rice expand in your belly, so stick to water or their amazing tea...   Lunch is around $21 smackers, all you can eat, no sharing... you get the idea...  Oh yes I will be back!",

    "text": "This is hands down the BEST sushi restaurant I've been to thus far. We're talking better than Yama, Kaizen, Sushi Mon and Jjanga. They are fairly new in town so I can only hope this continues to be the case after they've become more popular.   The friendly, warm service was better than expected. This one guy Richard, who seemed to be the manager, constantly came over to check on me and other guests. Based on my initial orders, he asked if he could recommend a couple dishes which were the specials of the evening. I've never had this happen before during an ayce experience.  There is soft lighting, dark tables and chairs and music that wasn't loud enough to get annoying. This would make a good place for a date. The sushi bar was the most spacious I've seen to date and with plenty of elbow room between chairs.  My picks for the evening:  *Screaming Orgasm: Lightly seared tuna over a bed of radish with some \"O\" sauce. *Salmon Tar Tare *Poke Salad *Evening specials (sashimi): Super white tuna & yellowtail. Both with jalapenos.  *Rolls: Big Easy, Dancing Eel, Kiss of Fire, Burning Your Stomach   After demolishing said dishes, I polished off the meal with a refreshing order of their Yuzu Sorbet. Part of me wanted the honey bread but nobody needed to see me get assisted out the door.   For $26 buckaroos for dinner, it can't get better than this. Also, don't forget your stamp card. Your 11th ayce is on them. I will be back at least once before the end of this month.",

Right in front of me one of the chefs squirted the sauce on his hand (which he had a glove on) bent down behind the sushi bar, and licked his glove!!!!!!!!! I'm assuming this was his version of a taste test.   Okay, gross, but what happened next was completely disturbing.   He stood back up, and continued to make sushi with the same hand he just licked!!!!!!!!   No change in glove, no hand wash, NOTHING.  Right back to packing rice with the same hand he just slobbered all over!!!!!  Needless to say, I'm BEYOND disgusted.  Luckily my friend and I had already asked for our check.   I left in a hurry, And I will NEVER be back.",

    "text": "Bookmarked this place to try in the hopes of finding an AYCE competitor to Yama, and I got to try it out with the boyfriend this past weekend.  In terms of taste, this place is really good. It also has an impressive menu. I liked the fact that they gave us an AYCE and a regular menu. The food is what has me giving this place 4 stars. Favorites from what we ordered: Tuna Poke Salad, Seaweed Salad, Yolo Special Roll (love the fried onions on top to compliment/balance the roll), Chicago Fire Roll (had enough spice for the boyfriend), Japanese Lasagna Roll (always a fave for us), Honey Bread (reminds me of a cinnamon roll with ice cream instead of frosting), and the fried Tempura Ice Cream (tasted like Fruity Pebbles Cereal). Honestly knocked one star off 'cause of customer service we experienced early in our dinner. It was nice to be greeted and seated right away. What wasn't cool was waiting for a waitress take our order about 10 minutes after we had been given water by the initial host to the evening. Umm... We didn't have our phones out, distracted from looking at the menu.  I will admit that it got slightly better after getting our appetizers, but when we were trying to order the sushi, the waitress was nowhere near our table.  I look up and around the restaurant for her, and she's at the cashwrap area, leaning against the counter or whatever, talking to the host that seated us. The boyfriend said he observed her there for awhile, but just didn't want to point it out to further irritate me.  I was about ready to leave when a waiter we hadn't seen earlier came by to get a sushi order. Big thanks to that gentleman. We never got 1 order of sushi I asked for, but no biggie 'cause he checked up on us more than our waitress, who I only saw pick up our plates, not saying a word to us. The host even checked on us more - asked about soda/water refills, and brought me the sake cooler I asked for. The fastest service I got from her was when she brought the check and picked it up in less than 5 minutes. What the...?",

We were soooo full after all the food but somehow they just kept coming!!  The service is friendly and they come around to check on you every now and then.

After ordering we asked the server what rolls that they gave us were and she had no idea what it was. If your server doesn't even know what it is how do you expect me to know if it's the right one? We just dismissed this and just said its ok and she just told us to eat it, that it's good.   As far as the quality of the food, it's ok but I've had better. I had the Arizona roll and Sunny Special. The Arizona roll had yellowtail, cucumber and avocado which was topped with yellowtail. I definitely enjoyed the Sunny Special more which had crab and was topped with salmon and a lemon slice, the lemon was too strong for my liking but once I took the lemon off the rest was enjoyable. I also ordered the poki tuna salad which was probably my favorite thing I ordered.  After eating we told the waitress that we would like our check, I guess she didn't hear us or forgot because she walked around for like 15 mins and then came back without the check and asked if we wanted anything else. We asked for our check again and I would say another 10-15 mins for us to get that as well. The restaurant as a whole is decent, they definitely need to work on customer service though.",

There was a great selection of rolls with really creative names as well as sides and appetizers to choose from. Rolls were too saucy for my taste. I am not a big sushi expert but I love the thick cuts of fish and how they melt in your mouth! Next time, I'll definitely get more of that. Desserts were pretty good. I got the mochi ice cream which was small so the perfect size after ayce.  Service was a bit slow. The restaurant was small with two to three servers. Every time we need something, it was a bit annoying trying to get the server's attention. However, our food came out pretty quickly!",

To start, we got Miso soup, Pork Belly, Spicy and Sweet Dumpling, and Coconut Shrimp Tempura.  We really enjoyed the pork belly side dish and the coconut shrimp tempura!  We didnt like the spicy and sweet dumplings so much we sent them back.    We then tackled the following rolls: Big easy, Sexy Lazy, Kiss of Fire , Sunny Special, Dragon, Fat Ass.  Our favorites were actually the sunny special (very fresh tasting and light!!) and the Fat Ass!!! Our least favorite was the Kiss of fire.  It was odd to have salsa on sushi - the salsa itself was great- just odd on this roll.    We also really liked the special - salmon nigiri.",

I also got my beloved unagi which they didn't drench in too much sauce.  Overall the quality was pretty average and I appreciated thst they didn't try to overload you with rice.  Sushi Way is a cozy little eatery with lots to offer.  The service is so-so and I had to remind our waitress a few times of forgotten items.  While I'm not sure if I want to replace my other AYCE sushi place [which starts with a \"G\" and sounds like a Pokemon], it's definitely a contender!",

    "text": "Came here due to the high number of good reviews & their menu options looked promising. Maybe we came in on a bad day but food wasn't up to expectations.   Starting with the nigiri - we first ordered eel nigiri. I absolutely love eel but it was drowning in eel sauce & eel tasted off. There was a lot of bones in eel which greatly detracts from the flavor. Salmon is my preferred fish but didn't even request a second order of salmon nigiri since the rice-to-fish ratio was so bad.  I ordered few of the no-rice rolls which were a no-go. When my \"rock & roll\" sushi came in (which is tuna , salmon , white fish , yellowtail & crab wrapped in cucumber) , the fish tasted frozen , there was waaaay too much crab (more crab than the actual tuna , etc.) & the cucumber was thick cut + orgasm sauce all on top tasted terrible. I didn't take a photo of mine but my \"rock & roll\" did not look like any of the photos other Yelpers have posted in the past which looked way better before.  We also ordered a few baked & deep fried rolls. It was hard finishing them even when we ordered half rolls. Did not taste as good as their descriptions sound.   I really wanted to enjoy the other menu items such as \"salmon tar tare\" in appetizers section & \"volcano roll.\" The orange/yellow sauce + sriracha on top of salmon tar tare was not a good combination. \"Volcano roll\" (which is also part of their no-rice rolls) could've been decent since I love avocado but the spicy tuna + crab inside tasted pretty much almost frozen too.  Service was bit slow but I can't blame them since they seem short staffed - during lunch looks like only one waiter , one food runner/busser & two sushi chefs. AYCE prices same like any other place/competitors - about 22$ for lunch & 27$ for dinner. However , I'd suggest trying out other places :(",

    "text": "(Review based on 2.5 stars)  Sushi Way is located in the same plaza as Tacos & Beer (right next to it actually) with parking. My husband and I decided to try this place on our last night in Las Vegas, for dinner. We came in for an early dinner around 5:30 pm. When we first came in, no one greeted us. A server walking around saw us but did not greet us. We were just standing around and decided to just seat ourselves at the bar.   As we sat there, we just waited. Eventually my husband asked the guy behind the bar (Mike) if he could take our order. He said he can only take sushi orders but not for the kitchen. I just kind of thought he would assume that we were here for the all you can eat option (pretty much as everyone else when they come in here...). My husband asked if he would take our order after he said that...   Anyways, during the course of our meal, service was initially average and lacking. But eventually 2 other servers came out and took care of patrons, including ourselves. I appreciate their attentiveness. Also eventually that guy, Mike, left to do inventory and this other guy came and he took care of us.   Everything we had was good, except for the uni. It was not fresh and had that fishy smell. You do not want your seafood to have that smell, if it does, it indicates it isn't fresh.   If service was better, I would award this place higher, but because of the lack of service in the beginning and a little after, I have no choice but to give this place 2.5 stars.  If you like being ignored and not being acknowledged, come by here for sushi. And then when you are done eat somewhere else. Being that this is Sin City, the land of buffets and gluttony, I am sure there is a better place to eat at.  By the way, for 2 people for dinner (all you can eat option), it will cost you $58.35 (tax included).",

There was no wait on a Friday at 7:30, which was awesome. Their fresh oysters are to die for, and the Sushi Solution roll was my favorite roll of the night. It's a far drive for us, but totally worth it! I definitely recommend this place, and we will be back soon!",

Good choice yelpers!   I love their salmon belly nigiri and we all ordered the \"one order\" only per person. Everything I tasted was fresh.  My husband didn't like their uni (sea urchin), he said there was a different taste to it and he has develop an acquired taste to uni. Anyhow, so far this is the only AYCE restaurant that doesn't limit on desserts. If I knew I could have saved more of my appetite on desserts.   Well,  I'll be back for sure! Happy eats!",

The dessert choices were also very good and I had the fried ice cream which was very good and recommended.",

Been to at least 5 other AYCE sushi place here in vegas and I would say Sushi way is 2nd to last... but don't get me wrong they are pretty okay though.   I'd rate the Food a 3.5 for the reason of they seem to be drowning with sauce and I did try and request for light sauce and still saucy for my preference but the customer service was great.

The 3 of us came for lunch one afternoon to satisfy our sushi cravings! My friend was raving about this place, so I had to come and try it.   Prices $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner. Lunch does not include sweet shrimp, uni and some of the other expensive items. Minus 1 star. We started with a bunch of sushi items on the sushi list. The fish was incredibly fresh, and each one had a long piece of fish on top of a piece of rice. The fish wasn't thick but definitely larger than many of the other AYCE places. The super white tuna just melts in your mouth, so good! The scallop sushi was made with real scallops, the smaller ones and definitely very fresh also. We followed the sushi with a bunch of rolls, and each one was made well and tasted great!    Service was decent, I did have to ask for refilled a few times. Free soda with Yelp check-in which is awesome. Dessert options were good. The sweet toast with ice cream was yummy. Bathrooms were clean, parking was easy. Definitley recommend!",

I can accept a little slower service on a Friday night, it was between 7 and 8:30 for our visit. It did take time to get our orders, they completely forgot one of our orders, but the worst part was the food.   The sushi was warmer than it should have been. The baked green mussels were drenched in cheese, the rolls were very bland, the candy cane, a soft shell crab roll seemed to not have any crab. The jalapeno poppers were decent, but I suspect those were pre made.   Over all not a place we will be returning too.",

And they put this overly citrus-y ponzu (I realize ponzu has citrus in it but this thing is out of balance) on a lot of the nigiri which is just... why??",

My recommendation for rolls would be the sexy lazy, sweet 16, big easy, and yolo. And for dessert, we tried the honey bread and yuzu sorbet. The honey bread tasted good but it was nothing special. The yuzu sorbet was great bc it cleanses your palate from all the heavy flavored sushi that you just ate. Their service is great, very attentive and fast with your orders. My wife and I have been here twice already in 1 month so that says a lot about a sushi place. This place is up there in my top sushi restaurants here in Vegas.",

I think if maybe we sat at the bar, the service would have been a little faster? It was by far the longest lunch I ever had. The appetizers came out fairly fast, but our sushi took forever and a day. The sushi chefs were very slow. Everyone around us seemed to be wondering the same thing, where is the food?!  The decor is very simple. There was a TV but it wasn't playing anything. I think if that was on, it would have helped with my boredom while waiting for my food. I think they could improve the atmosphere with better decor considering this is close to the strip and the restaurants around this area are nice.  The sushi was ehhh. Nothing was extraordinary. Nothing I had to have more of. Some things were okay, some were not good. We went for lunch, but the lunch AYCE doesn't include some of the items I wanted, like sea urchin (uni) and fresh oysters so I paid the dinner price. I never eat sushi without having uni. This was by far the worse uni I've ever had. First off, it was a really small amount. Second off, it left a really bad bitter taste in your mouth, which means the uni was not fresh.  We were completely underwhelmed by this place. I don't understand why it's so highly rated. There's so many places out there and I would have to say this is my least favorite. We won't be back.o",

We came to find a completely full restaurant and no host at the stand. When I could finally get the attention of a staff member, we were told a party had come in 5 mins before us claiming to be me and swiped our reservation. The restaurant was unwilling to move the party even though they had not placed any orders, and we were forced to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting, we were told again we couldn't be helped. We were never offered any compensation (discount, free drinks, etc) or even a simple apology for the inconvenience. The restaurant staff was unwilling to accept any blame for the incident and did 0 to alleviate the situation. We eventually were forced to leave hungry due to our tight schedule.   Although I live close, I will never return to this restaurant, and I will do my best to make sure no one I know goes there either.",

Unlike others, you can order as many items at one time as you want when they aren't busy.  The food was great and I prefer sushi over rolls.  They had many sushi choices so I wasn't limited in that way either.  They have cooked items for the not so adventurous.  The place is very small so going on off hours makes it more fun.",

Only one sushi chef and several tables were occupied, so the wait for  your order was a few minutes.  Once the 2nd sushi chef arrived, everything went a lot faster.  Our waitress was very attentive and courteous.  Nigiri sushi tasted very fresh.  Cuts of fish were pretty big, while the rice was kept to a minimum.    We had a desert called honey bread, using Hawaiian sweet bread dinner rolls.  Shokudo in Hawaii uses something like Texas toast.  Similar in taste, just not quite as big.  Usually I walk out of an ayce sushi place feeling full and uncomfortable.  This time I felt satisfied and just right.  Very comfortable atmosphere.  Definitely will be back for my sushi cravings!",

I have been to a ton of different sushi places in Vegas over the last 5 years and these reviews absolutely do my match up to what it should be rated. The food came out 1 plate at a time and took forever in between plates. The restaurant wasn't that busy and the food is subpar as well compared to many of the other options in the city. This place offers almost the exact same menu as Sakana. Sakana is top 2 of AYCE places in Vegas for sure. Unfortunately will never eat at Sushi Way again. Staff was nice though.",

There were a couple of rolls I ordered that came with crab but it was more of a crab 'salad' - I was a bit surprised but it was still very good. The wait can be a little long after you put in your order, but that's not atypical when you're eating sushi.  What would have been a 5 star review - if based on food and value - became a 4 star because of the service inaccuracy. We ordered twice and both times the server forgot to put in one of our rolls with the kitchen.",

    "text": "Called Saturday afternoon to make a reservation. The lady on the phone asked me how many people and what time. She then asked me to hold for a second after I answered her. I felt odd because she was one question away to complete my reservation (my name) but anyway. I eventually hanged up after 6 minutes of hold. I waited for 15 minutes to call again. Again, I was asked how many and what time and \"hold a second\". I was like again?? wth??!! Good that a second lady came to the phone and took my reservation this time.  Our waiter was nice enough but they are definitely short staffed. There were only 2 waitstaff on a Saturday night. We had hard times getting help for anything.  The food. It's not super bad per se as none of us got sick after. But for sure it's not 4 1/2 stars worth. The rice are a bit dry. The fish tasted obviously frozen and thawed. The rolls were lack of flavor. They are all so bland even with different sauces. One of the rolls we had was called \"Burn your Ass\" of something like that. It wasn't even spicy at all.   I had hot tea to start with. Since the service was so slow and I never got my tea refilled, I decided to order a soda. When the bill came, I was shocked to find out they charge $2.50 for hot tea. Mind you it's only some generic luke warm green tea. Well, the soda was also $2.50 which I expected. But generic green tea, which they were too busy to refill, for $2.50??   I suspected most of the good reviews are from out of towners. Most of the cities in the US do not have as many AYCE sushi restaurants as Vegas. With 90% of the sushi restaurants in Vegas are AYCE, we are spoiled and picky. I'll stick with my favorite Sushi Neko from now on.",

I was so wrong. Our server was very attentive. Since we sat at the bar, we placed our orders directly with the sushi chef, who was unexpectedly friendly & funny. We both had AYCE dinner for $27. The chef was very quick with each item that we ordered, and the rolls, though prepared fast, were delicious & neat, not overly ricey. My brother paid the bill, & he was so impressed that he left a $24 tip. It's a good thing I live on the other side of town or else I would be there about every other week. I did, however, leave with one of those food card things, with the 11th AYCE being free. Although not every other week, I do see myself driving to that side of town every now & again specifically for Sushi Way.",

He attended to us, made my toddler niece feel special (brought her chopsticks with the grip, suggested kid friendly foods, and surprised her with treats like mochi ice cream and a Jolly Rancher candy), he recommend us rolls, was funny, and in every way exceeded our customer service experience. The food was beyond delicious and they are generous with the fish portions. On top of all this, they have unique rolls, deserts, and dishes, which were all superb and flavorful. This is now our favorite sushi spot! Which makes it even better they have a stamp card to treat you after your 10th stamp!  I love this place!

    "text": "This is located where the old Firefly was. My husband bookmarked this place and we came after venturing to M&M world. We went on a weeknight around 730 and there were only a handful of people. It's hard to pass by if you do not know exactly where the place is, when I called to ask what shopping center the restaurant is located, the person who answered the phone seemed a bit confused lol. It's where Tacos & Beer is, if that makes it easier to find.  AYCE dinner was like $27 a person?! I thought the server was really nice (didn't catch HIS name though). Also I thought the restaurant was nice and clean. But, I have to say it's not better or worse than any other sushi restaurant, it's comparable to Goyemon, Osyhi, etc.  The one thing I have to rave about was the Sushi Nacho. Omg, YUM!!!!!!! That was the best thing they had. I would've ordered like 10 of those if I wasn't full from the other rolls. But honestly, I can't really remember the rolls being that great or special except for that one. Their Japanese lasagna was also good, they put a lot of cream cheese on it.  Fish seemed and tasted fresh.   If you're in the area, go check it out. I just wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.",

We tried the Red Boy, Sex Bomb, Sushi Lover, Chicago Fire,  Go Rebel, Carrot Top, OMG, and DD rolls. We also had Seared Tuna and Fresh Water Eel Nigiri along with Coconut Shrimp Tempura and Bacon Scallop Skewers. Dessert selections are also included so we had the FBI(fried banana and ice cream) and Strawberry Mochi ice cream. Everything tasted fresh. I even enjoyed the iced tea. We got there right after they opened at 1130 and service did slow down a little once they started filling up(and it did fill up), but our server was great and we really had a great meal. The only downside I found is they have a no sharing rule. But, with half roles available, that was mitigated.",

They're quick, polite, and always checking up on us in a timely manner. (SPECIAL THANKS TO JANE!! SHES AN AWESOME WAITRESS, PRETTY TOO FELLAS  lol) So far everything that ive ordered tastes WONDERFUL! FULL OF FLAVOR. NOTHING bland touched my toungue. I would definitely recommend this place to ANYONE. Dinner is a must tho, its 26.95 a person, but you can bet your ass that itS MUCH WORTH IT. My new \"GO TO SPOT\" FOR AYCE. i love it here!

    "text": "I was hesitant to really believe all the 4 & 5 star reviews for this venue as I've seen those types of reviews in the past where the venue did not live up to the hype. Well I have to say that Sushi Way really does live up to the 4-5 star reviews. Went in with a group if 10 people tonight with having made a reservation ahead of time. Table was all made up for us. The restaurant was not busy at all until toward the end of our meal which was about 2 hrs after we arrived. We all ordered the AYCE & ordered lots of things & I'd have to say that almost everything was fabulous. I didn't get pictures of everything we ordered but I'd have to say we had about 10-12 more items ordered than what you'll see in my photos. Some of the rolls are the same rolls from I Love Sushi which I thought was great because I love the Cherry Blossom just wished Sushi Way's version had the crunchy like I Love Sushi's Cherry Blossom does. Really loved the Salmon Tar Tare, tuna nigri, yellowtail & Rock & Roll roll.  From what I recall we ordered: Nigri: Tuna, Salmon, Super White Tuna, Yellowtail, Garlic Tuna, Ebi, Unagi,  Albacore, Seared Albacore, Octopus, Squid, Fresh Scallop, Uni,   Sides: Poki Tuna Salad, Screaming Orgasm, Shrimp Tempura, Coconut Shrimp Tempura, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Sweet and Spicy Dumpling, Salmon Tar Tare, Calamari Tempura, Fresh Oyster, Baked Green Mussel, Sushi Nacho  Rolls: Spider Roll, Dancing Eel, James Bond, Cherry Blossom, Rock & Roll, Burning Your Stomach Roll, Mexican Roll, Candy Cane Roll, Lisa Hand Roll,  I Love My A Roll   Pros:  - Nigri was super fresh. Tuna was fabulous. We ordered about everything on the nigri list as well as serveral \"side dishes\" as they like to call the appetizers.   - Super friendly service & they were on top of service almost the whole evening until the end.   - Like the fact that you can order 1/2 orders on rolls all through meal & not just the last roll you eat.   - Allowed our group to have the 10% off locals discount for their Christmas special.  Cons:  - Table placed vertical to wall didn't leave enough room for 10 people to sit comfortably without bumping elbows. Wishing the table would have been placed parallel to the wall with three 4 seat top table tops.   - Shrimp heads were undesirable as they were over cooked & you could tell the oil was not hot enough when they were fried & oil tasted old.   - Oyster on the half shell seemed to have been pre-frozen. They just didn't taste fabulous. - Towards end of night it seems that our table was being ignored as 2 rolls had been forgotten that were ordered as well as desert for 2 people was forgotten & it took over 10 minutes to get it while everyone else had already eaten their desert.   Although the Cons list may look longer than the Pros list the cons will not deter me from coming back to Sushi Way. It's definitely on the \"repeatable\" list.",

    "text": "I want to love this place; I really do. I absolutely love nigiri, so when someone tells me that there's an AYCE sushi place that serves fresh quality cuts, I come running. These tippers were right on the dart.   Perhaps it was just my experience in particular that was bad.   I came on a Wednesday, not quite yet during a rush period, but nearing.   I started with my usual orders: uni, salmon, tamago, yellowtail, you name it. Everything had a refreshing taste to it, top notch quality that was almost on par with Sushi Koma. I particularly thought that their sweet shrimp was the best I've seen in an AYCE so far.   I had a delightful time with the food but... not so much with the chefs.   They took a long time, and when I say long, I mean a REALLY LONG time. I'm usually not so picky about the wait since I know that I happen to order a lot at a time. However, after waiting for over 10 minutes before the rush hour even began, I was starting to get suspicious.   I timed them. 11 minutes, 14 minutes, a whopping 17 minutes. Even when my order just consisted of oysters, 13 minutes.  Perhaps making nigiri does take a long time, one by one, as my waitress assured me; however, in comparison to other sushi places in the valley, this is by far the slowest. Where is the competitiveness in that?   I watched the chefs. I literally had my eyes hawking at them with laser focus. They were talking, chit-chatting, laughing, having fun amongst themselves, and NOT working on my order.   Hm, maybe that's why.",

    "text": "Up for a challenge?!  You will be challenged to try EVERYTHING on the menu...oh and did I mention it's all you can eat?  Oh yeah!!! AYCE!   To start please order a refreshing beverage - Japanese beer, cold and flavored sakes and soft drinks for your designated drivers (yes, children, do not drink and drive).  Then once your thirst has been quenched, plan ahead and pace yourself: I would recommend the sushi nachos (2-pieces per order) and seafood bounty generously piled on two crispy fried won ton chip (it's the nacho part of the dish) which perfectly pairs with the freshest morsels of seafood goodness, peppered with minced jalapenos for an extra kick.  You can then open the floodgates of sushi heaven - there are over 50 different type of rolls -fresh rolls, soft shell crab rolls, shrimp tempura rolls, baked rolls and deep-fried rolls.  By the way this was only the first side of the menu!  Flip it over then you will be wooed to try traditional nigiri sushi, vegetable rolls, an assortment of side dishes, soups and salad!  Are we food drunk yet?!  Not quite...please, please reserve your second stomach for the desserts!  Mochi ice cream, green tea ice cream, Yuzu (Japanese citrus) sorbet (my favorite!), tempura ice cream and honey toast!  Whew!   Bottom line my fellow Yelpers, there is something for everyone!  Just make your way to Sushi Way on 3900 Paradise Road, Suite B...and you'll be in paradise for sure!",

    "text": "I just back from this AYCE sushi resturant. The resturant was dark and seating was average in comparison to other sushi resturant. I did notice that there weren't any seatings for 2. Not a big deal but if you come with just one other person expect to have 2 empty seats next to you. (Kinda kills the romantic vibe). I came in during a slow time so I'm not sure how busy it gets but the store was basically empty for most of the time. There is also a bar where you can watch the chef crate the sushi right in front of you. WHAT! Pretty cool. We didn't sit there though we just sat at a table. There was only one waiter while we were there but another showed up as we left. The waiter that helped us was very attentive without being intrusive. It was a little hard to understand him but that wasn't a big deal. He was very nice.  The food. Only have one word for it... amazing. (The 5 stars probably killed the suspense of that but whatever). We had a lot of sushi rolls. Probably around 10. Needless to say we were pretty stuffed after we left. They were all good. Some better than others. The only one that I didn't particularly enjoy was the fat ass. They don't call it that for no reason. It was huge! However it did taste a little bland compared to the other rolls. It was still good though... I don't eat spicy food. Like at all and I was disappointed to see most of the menu items had some sort of spicy ingredient. I was a little turned off when I saw that the sushi I ordered had jalapenos... until I tasted it. FREAKING AMAZING! The spiciness wasn't overwhelming at all. It added a small zesty taste to the sushi. Coming from a person that hates spicy food. It was the best thing I have ever tasted with jalapenos on it. They do offer a fairly small desert menu. I got the green tea ice cream. It was good as expected. They offer one desert per person if you get the ayce deal.  They do have a few rules that actually didn't bother us at all. A common rule in most ayce sushi resturant is that if you don't finish the roll then you have to pay full price for it. This is the norm so it didn't really bother us. Also we saw that there was an hour time limit to eat on the menu. However it was slow and they didn't really hold us to that. I imagine during more busy time of day they might be more strict on this rule.  Decor average and no two table seatings 4 stars      Add seatings for 2 and this will immediately jump to a five. They probably won't though because the resturant was a little small.  Service attentive without being intrusive 5 stars  Food amazing 5 stars  If you haven't been here. Definitely check it out. They gave us a coupon for free meal on our 11th visit. We will definitely be back and are looking forward to our future free meal and many more to come!",

This is not like other All you can Eat Sushi places where they give you lots of rice and small pieces of fish.  Each dish is prepared with a noticeable attention to detail that is normally reserved for high-end Sushi Bars.  I opted for Chef's Choice tonight and i was not dissaponted.  The Chef brought me some very good Sushi dishes that I would never have thought of ordering on my own.  Some of the other reviews have complained about slow service.  I can see where some impatient people would say that but remember this is not a buffet and it is not fast food.  Quality and attentions to detail does take a little longer.  So relax, enjoy the company you came with and enjoy some excellent Sushi.  I will be back and I will be bringing firends.",

The AYCE menu is quite extensive and there only about 10 items that are limited to just a single order per person while the rest of the menu is unlimited.  The only reason why I have deducted a star is that when it gets really busy here, the wait times for your sushi will be LONG.  We nearly waited 30 minutes just to get a few rolls and some sashimi.  They also have a time limit but I am not sure if it is enforced since everyone is waiting for their orders.  To their credit though, the food is delicious and the service is friendly.  Not sure I would be back though due to the long waits.",

So many rolls sounded so good I wish I could have tried more, but I did manage to try the Big Easy, sweet 16, spider roll, hamichi, salmon belly and super white tuna with jalapeno(chef special that day).  The list of appetizers was extensive as well.  The bacon wrapped scallops and kamakazi dynamite were recommended by our chef/owner, who was very friendly and was ready and willing to keep our sushi flowing.  I live in Reno and only get down to Vegas 4 to 5 times a year,  I cant wait to come back and try some more menu items.  I highly recommend having dinner here SO GOOD!",

But most of their rolls are forgettable and too similar, their screaming orgasm lacks complexity and their salmon tar tare is bland and just too much (it's a meal in itself). Mochi ice cream was bland, plus they need more variety. Service was very friendly and helpful.  They treat you good here, and the food isn't bad, but there's much better ayce in the area.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place. I'm always looking for new AYCE sushi restaurants and usually Yelp doesn't let me down. However, I was disappointed tonight.   The service - Our server was training a new person. Both of them were nice, but about halfway through the meal our server let the trainee take over and she didn't seem to have any idea about the menu, which roll was which, or even basic sushi terminology. Also, at one point the sushi chef told our server to not let us order more until we were finished with what was on the table... Since I don't really like sushi rolls, and I had finished all the nigiri I ordered, I had to wait until my 3 other dinning companions had finished their rolls. I've never experienced that before.   The food - Very underwhelming. We started with some apps... The mussels were okay, nothing special, and had way too much eel sauce. The salmon tartare was super bland, but the nachos were flavorful. The hamachi kama was over cooked, but the portion size was good. Tempura was just ok, too. The best one was the poke, it was spicy and full of flavor, but when we ordered a second one it wasn't spicy at all. They were like two completely different dishes. All of the rice was super mushy. I tried to order a spicy scallop hand roll but they wouldn't make it for me. They gave me a yum yum scallop roll instead, that had absolutely no flavor. I can't really speak to the rolls, but as we were leaving, one of my friends said he wouldn't go back because he wasn't impressed with the rolls he had.   Overall, it was such a disappointing experience. We'll be sticking to Sushi Mon or Goyemon for our late night AYCE sushi fix.",

    "text": "Amazing is an understatement and close by the convention center make this the new best sushi in Las Vegas.  Even if it were not AYCE, I would still come here!  Here's my recommendations:  #1 Salmon Belly nigiri tied with Hamachi nigiri #2 Wasabi Tobiko #3 Super White Tuna with jalapeno (sashimi)  This is the type of place that when it gets really popular (been open for 9 months), you'll have to get here early (6PM).  Their Salmon belly is actually better than any Chu-toro or O-toro at the higher end places and a fraction of the price.  Wonderful!!!",

Tasted fresh and different than most things I eat at sushi spots.  Appetizers: Screaming Orgasm - This was ok. The fish was different than say sushimon. Fresh oyster - it was fresh and good Coconut shrimp tempura - I loved it.  It was flavorful :)  Rolls: I love my ass - good Snow White - good Jack Rabbit - good  Nigiri: Salmon Roe - average. Same quality you would find in most restaraunts at their level Garlic Tuna - it was fresh. Didn't really care for the salt or spice they out on top of it. Salmon - kinda tasted like Scottish salmon. It melted in my mouth!  Yellowtail - it was average Fresh scallop - it was average Sweet shrimp - it was average  The tempura ice cream was the same like you would get at most spots.  My son said the honey bread was ok.  Will I come back? Maybe. This is out of the way for me because I live near Mountains Edge. There's other spots around the area that I can eat at.   The service was ok. Felt like they could've done better. I did receive excellent service from Jay. The lady that waited are table first didn't talk too much but she was nice enough to give my baby girl a lollipop to stop her from crying.",

I was worried about food-born illness.  Their specials were room temperature and tasted bad.  The presentation was sloppy and the sushi nachos difficult to eat.  My tempura shrimp was undercooked.  We ordered at least 10 items and were disappointed with everything.  I left hungry but paid the bill ($30+) for each of us. I was worried I'd never eat sushi again (I typically love it), but was redeemed in South San Francisco with a delicious lunch this week.  I wouldn't let my dog eat @ Sushi Way.  How they get good reviews on Yelp is beyond me.",

You could feel the unhappy coming off of her; I know what it is like to have a bad day and it's ok to not be super friendly but it not OK to walk around mopey and slow without a care in the world about your job and the customers there. She was not welcoming in any way and took forever to even get us water, then completely forgot my green tea; I didn't bother asking again.   HOWEVER I was bummed at first because the AYCE  lunch didn't include some things on the menu that my other usual AYCE sushi spots do, such as my favorite: screaming orgasm! The sushi chefs behind the bar were great (one was possibly the owner) and made me a screaming O even though it wasn't offered. The chefs were very nice and quick to get us all the sushi we wanted so that made up for the negative energy emitting off of the server.   Over all Sushi Way is not a bad spot; very clean and comfortable. Service and vibe is very important to me so I am not sure if I will go back any time soon but I am not against going back either.",

    "text": "All You Can Eat sushi is usually a very good thing. Normally it is a delicious event. This is not the Sushi Way. You have to shove rolls into a napkin so you can throw them away in the bathroom. That is the Sushi Way, way.  Took a minute to be seated. It had a decent amount of people in here. We did beat out a group of 8 ladies that had to wait a while for a table.   $25 for AYCE sushi. A touch north of what I want to pay, but hell, it's a Friday night. I can take the hit.   Cherry Blossom Roll: This was my first roll. This roll was a red flag. It's spicy tuna, crab and green onion inside wrapped in avocado with eel sauce with crunch. I thought it was a joke when it came out. It's comically large. You can't pick it up with chop sticks. It doesn't hold together to take a bite. It all falls apart. Plus, it didn't taste fresh at all. Crunch was just brown sugar which didn't add anything to the roll. It was actually jarring to get a mouth full of brown sugar out of nowhere.   No relief in sight. Screaming Orgasm was also gross. It's just tasted old. The sauce was flat. Just like it had been sitting out all day.   After these two lackluster rolls, we ordered more. And waited. And waited. And waited. Went to the restroom. Noticed there was no soap in the bathroom. Compounded with the fact that I had to FIGHT with the automatic hand towel dispenser to get a scrap of paper towel. With all this in mind, I wondered, \"How do they properly wash their hands before touching all these rolls?\"  With my appetite diminishing exponentially, I could take in the environment around me. This is when I noticed the head sushi chef looked like he had some frat party to go to after work. He was wearing his hat backwards while plating the sushi. I couldn't stop thinking, \"Who even wears hats backwards anymore?\" Am I judging a book by its cover? Just ask the people he was about to serve sushi to when he yanked the plate away to fix the presentation of the plate (top of rolls falling off the bottom part). Seemed super professional. He also was just staring at the 8 women who came in after us. Just watching him stare in that direction for most of the night. Sushi weren't the only rolls this guy had his mind on.    Along the professional route, one server also openly was flirting with the other one in front of us. Or something akin to flirting. I have no clue what was going on. After bringing us our rolls, server asked if we wanted anything else. One server playfully hit the other server, then says something to the effect of, \"We can beat each other up if you want us too.\"  Uhhhh. Please. No.  By the way, did I mention we never got our own plates? We had to eat right off the plates the rolls came in. Supes profesh.  The rolls we got were even worse. Salmon belly was whatever, tasted like it had been sitting out on the counter for hours. We had burnt eel. We had old stale rice. We had more unfresh fish. Debated on how to dispose of this food. Almost settled on the \"dump it in the plastic tree\" move but decided it was too cartoony and rude.  This is where I had to eventually take the rolls into a napkin and dump them in the bathroom trash can. That was the easy part. Hard part was fishing paper towels to dry my hands.  Any redeeming qualities? Sherbet sure was good. Legitimately, the best tasting thing we had there.   I have never had such a strange sushi experience in my life. I'm glad I'm still alive after eating that food. Don't get me wrong, I didn't feel great, but I'm alive.  There are tons of other sushi places that are better (Yama Sushi, Sushi Mon, Japaniero) so don't even waste your time here.",

I'm not from Las Vegas, but I will definitely come here for my sushi cravings whenever I'm in the area. My partner and I ordered: Philadelphia Roll, Kiss of Fire, and the Baked Salmon Roll. We don't eat a lot of sushi so we did a la carte. It doesn't show that they offer than on the menu - but they do.   The ambience is dark and intimate. It's a nice small restaurant and it's not loud. I think people will enjoy coming here for a nice meal after the club or to wind down.   I dont have a favorite sushi restaurant in California (where I am from) but I kind of wish this place was there so I could go every week.  Our server was also really nice and friendly. This was one of the few places I've been where I didn't have a problem with customer service at all. He was there whenever we needed something but was not pushy about drinks or adding more items. The food was brought out so fast too! These chefs have magical hands I swear!  10/10 will return.",

    "text": "Wow I dont even know what to say. We have been out of the area for a while. I haven't had sushi in 9 months. The first thing on my list to do when returning home to Vegas was Sushi Way. What happened to this place. The server kept forgetting what we ordered. So much rice on the one roll I ordered and also on the nigiri. The screaming orgasm was two cuts of tuna nigiri thrown over some daikon. The salmon tar tar that used to have a nice presentation was some salmon cut and tossed over a pile of crab salad. It seriously looked like some ones left over picked at appetizer. We used to eat here once a week and thought I would be doing that again. We will not be eating there any more. What a let down for my first sushi in 9 months. Its really just too bad.",

Well, I'm glad I chanced it.. because not only was the sushi fresh and delishes, it arrived in 30 minutes! Faster than most pizza delivery. I had spicey tuna rolls, Philly rolls with masago added, and hamachi rolls. I keep my sushi basic and traditional... no fancy stuff for me. I made a special request to pack my to-go boxes on ice, it was done so well. The ice didn't even have a chance to melt in the bag it got here so fast. I will definitely order from them again, and visit their restaurant to try the all you can eat. Very impressed, and satisfied.",

This year at CES, we have continued to enjoy the same, good quality sushi that we craved for after dining here a year ago. On top of their fresh sushi, the sushi chefs themselves are all bright and full of energy, ready to serve you delicious food the entire night. Both of the sushi chefs that we had the pleasure of serving us, Jun and Matthew, were quick to pick up on our preferences and serve us both quickly and at appropriate times. My family appreciated their hospitality and definitely will return the next time we are back in Las Vegas!",

I walked in with a group of 5 people and right when we walked in we were not greeted by any of the staff. I work at an AYCE sushi restaurant in Southern California and this type of behavior would never fly. Sushi Way is an AYCE restaurant and the server was writing down my tables order on a note pad. With that being said, only half of our items showed up that we ordered. They need to develop a better method for keeping track of the orders. At my restaurant, we have a sheet with all of the AYCE items and the customer can check the items they want, then the server picks up the sheet and inputs it into a POS system. On top of that, the food was not good. The fish was not fresh, and it was very inconsistent. Luckily I was only visiting Vegas for the weekend because I will never have to return to this place again.",

The sweet shrimp was really good and a good size (according to my friend since I don't eat that).   Throughout our experience my friend kept ordering \"hot\" tea.   It was not hot.  Not hot at all.  So that was a disappointment.  It wasn't busy at all the entire time we were eating but they hardly checked up on us.  The ambiance was good, lighting was good with good music.  They switch servers in the middle of us eating which wasn't bad but we didn't know who to flag down when we needed to order something so it took longer than we would have liked to order and get our food.  I would say over all they get a 3.5.  I'm hoping the next visit I have will be better service since the food was pretty good.",

    "text": "I work at a sushi restaurant in California, I was extremely disappointed in the food. I was already expecting it to be pretty bad because it is AYCE, but this was un expectable. The octopus was not fresh or anything near it! When I told them it was bad and I couldn't eat it, they told me it's probably too fresh for me. That is not what it is, I eat sushi every other day because I love sushi and that's why I work in the field. Plus if fish was so fresh why would it be AYCE, it would not. Not to mention there was 3 servers that day with 4 tables and they were so slow, when I asked them about it they said it was super busy earlier. But what about now, we still need things. Over all I recommend going somewhere else for sushi, I felt sick afterwards, all my friends did. Let me save you and your stomach, don't go!",

The sushi maker and waitresses were very friendly and on-point, the food was out of this world.  I decided early in the evening to let the sushi maker pick the rolls for me - because they were so good.  Not one wasn't top notch.  This is a Vegas-off the strip-must go spot.  A+",

Wait is really not long around 5-10 min. considering it was dinner time too. Service is very good and the servers can be very funny and easy to talk too. The only real issue that I found was that the sushi can sometimes have too much rice stuffed underneath but only occasionally. Will definitely comeback!",

    "text": "Went here with some friends to try out a new AYCE sushi place since we wanted to shake things up a bit. This location is near the strip and is located in a small plaza, so be sure to make the turn at the light because I thought I could just turn directly in, but there is no other entrance.  For lunch they only give you 60 minutes to order your food so make sure you have your whole party with you to maximize the time. I ordered a couple of rolls, but I wasn't really impressed with any of them since I've had much better. The only item I would highly recommend getting is the sushi nachos which is basically a bunch of raw fish stacked on top of a tortilla chip (think of it as a seafood tostada). The rice to fish ratio is alright, but they could cut down on the rice a bit. Also, you can only get one dessert item per person. They are really stingy!  The service was both good and bad. The male waiter is very nice and attentive while the Korean lady really needs to brush up on her customer service. I called her over to just order a seaweed salad and the cucumber salad since I wanted something refreshing with my sushi rolls. The first thing she says is \"oh, but you already ordered a lot.\" First of all, my orders were all half rolls and I was only ordering two light appetizers. Secondly, doesn't she realize that I was doing the AYCE menu? I'd be more understanding if I ordered a bunch of stuff, but I was being rather conservative for the first round. Luckily she took my order, but I've never had that kind of experience before. It just sucks that she is the one to take the orders, while the guy can only clean up or give more water. If the service was better on the lady's end I would have considered giving a higher rating.  Overall, I would not recommend this place. The food is alright, but I would recommend going to Sushi Twister or Sakana. Trust me on  this one lol.",

We were greeted by the staff right away and got a great seat the sushi bar (Great Choice). One of the head chef I believe (Mike) was excellent. He was friendly and breakdown the whole menu. A hidden gem about this spot is you don't have to order a whole roll. You can mix and match a few rolls so you can get a little bit of everything. Eel rolls are my absolute favorite so I made sure I sampled all of the different rolls they had to offer. They didn't disappoint!  I also ordered several different sides like the screaming organism and the short ribs. All on point.  This spot is definitely competing for my favorite sushi spot in Vegas.",

It's also very entertaining to watch them prepare my meal. And wow! I was very impressed by the temperature of the sushi and the fish to rice ratio was excellent.  I was even more impressed that the chef kept making items that were off menu! I was game for anything!  I love that this place doesn't use a lot of cream cheese in their sushi as fillers! If I want to eat cream cheese, I have lots in my fridge! LOL  Having an option for sushi half rolls is another reason I consider when dining in and I'm glad this place offers that! Some places only do half rolls on your last order. Then there's the awesome staff at Sushi Way. Where they treat you in an AWESOME way!",

Sushi was fresh and tasty. We had tuna, halibut, salmon and rolls. I can't remember the rolls we had nor did I take pictures of them but they were very good. The waiter would also do recommendations of what to try and everything was very good. My wife also ordered noodles in this place and she enjoyed them while I tore up the all you can eat sushi. You really can't go wrong. When in Vegas I will definitely be going back to sushi way and hitting up the all you can eat!",

She took us on an amazing tour of the flavors and combinations of the menu.  If you like creative sushi with a twist try this place.  We enjoyed Sunny Special, I love my a$$, kiss of fire, Red boy, Sushi nacho, rock roll, burning your stomach, and Mochi Ice cream (mango flavoured. All worth the experience.",

It's a nice sized place with enough room between tables.  The service is great, they really look happy to see you. I felt really good as soon as I walked in, great vibe! And they're fast, so be careful not to order too many things at once because you'll have your table full!  They are really good explaining the menu and suggesting so if you're unsure or confused, jus ask them! The food looks and tastes good, I was super excited after reading the reviews here and I sure was not disappointed. The reason why this place is not a 5 star for me is the fact that they ran out of gyoza, which happens to be my favorite item in any Japanese menu; and the fact that their bathroom looks dark and a little messy.",

That was the winner for me. I love anything cream cheese. The server recommended I do the \"All You Can Eat\"  and I'm glad I did. Both my rolls totaled $27 which is .50 more than the AYCE. I was impressed because AYCE included everything on the menu as compared to other AYCE restaurants which limit you to certain items. I was with 2 others and they ordered a few different items plus Edamame. The only con for me was the miso soup wasn't hot.  Other than that, the service was great and the sushi was delicious and very much worth the $26.95 AYCE.",

And \"All you can eat\" sushi, lunch special of $22 bucks is a steal. Cut rolls, sashimi, hand rolls, appetizers, dessert, can all be included (with only a handful of exceptions). So bomb.

I'll add one more to that, my buddy and I had a great experience here.  We found it tucked away in the shopping complex, and got seated right away.  We decided on getting a few rolls instead of AYCE, and it was a good call.  2 rolls each, and a few appetizers.  They came to the table SO FAST, like they were already made.  Good quality fish, quick service, cheap rolls all together.  40 bucks for both of us and so much food on the table.  Great place!!",

Whenever we try a new place, I'm always afraid the food is going to be bad and my meal will be ruined. The food here is actual good and the dinner buffet is reasonably priced.

All the nigiri was well prepared with good rice and good proportions of fish cut perfectly. I tried a little of everything and thought the Halibut, Yellowtail, Albacore, super white tuna, and sweet shrimp were delicious. I tried all the rolls my brother got and those were all good as well. The chefs at the bar were friendly and service was great. For the price, this was the best fish quality I've had in town.  Pro-tip: get the side of fresh wasabi. It makes a huge difference and tastes way better than the paste most places serve. At $1.50 for a side of their house wasabi it was well worth trying.  The one knock some people might have (but not me), is that the sides/appetizers list isn't terribly big. My wife doesn't like seafood and some places have sizeable non-fish options. This is not one of those places.   I look forward to coming here again!",

Service was a little odd, we ordered multiple on the menu that apparently they were out of but we weren't informed until we asked where is that specific item because it's been a while and still hadn't received it. And also items we didn't order showed up to our table as well.  Overall the experience was OK I feel like there are definitely better all you can eat places around town.",

    "text": "Read all of the great reeviews on Yelp! And my wife and I decided to try this place out. I was celebrating my birthday along with my best friend who joined us as well. We walked into the restaurant and waited 15-20 minutes before a sushi chef greeted us and told us to have a seat at a 4 person table in front of us. As we began to sit, the waitress finally came over and told us that we'd need to wait an additional 10 minutes to be seated. As we all stood there confused as to the service or lack thereof, the guests of the entire restaurant seemed as though they were also very disappointed. We finally decided to just sit ourselves down after 15 more minutes of waiting and nobody caring to acknowledge us. We sat at our table for another 20 minutes and as we sat there, two other small parties came in and were seated. The parties of people that came in after us were brought water and greeted before us. When the waitress finally decided to come and greet us, we brought this to the her attention and she rudely said that they only had two people working and had no sense to respectfully apologize. Had she done that, it would have been different, but the fact that we were treated with disrespect, we got up and left this place that so many others have given 5 stars. So disappointing!!!! Good thing we were in Vegas and had so many other options to choose from! It did set us back and as a result, we were late to a show after finally getting something to eat.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why this place has received such good reviews.  Frankly, my experience was underwhelming, to say the least.  The appetizers selection was fairly wide, though the few good items were limited to one order per person (like oysters, and random for a sushi restaurant, galbi).  Nigiri selection was overall decent, though the uni was suspect (had a weird dark mustard color and sure enough, tasted odd).  Overall, fish was OK, though the salmon belly did stand out.   I'd be willing to come back here again, until I realized there are better and more affordable options (read: Goyemon Sushi, despite the always long wait).  Service was probably the deal breaker.  I basically had to stack all the empty plates to the edge of the table for someone to notice and come remove them/take new orders.  For an AYCE sushi place, there seemed to be a lot of resistance to our party ordering more food.  After our first initial order, we wanted more food, but was met with the waitress asking if we're gonna \"finish all that food\"?  Uh.. YEAH, we just barely started!  Another time we ordered, the waitress warned us that we have to eat all the rice that comes with the nigiri sushi.  She must have spotted the roll of rice that was left on my friend's plate.. the same one that dropped on the table beyond the five-second rule and she decided to not eat.  Thought that comment was unnecessarily passive aggressive.  Lastly, when it came time to dessert, it was only one order per person.  Good thing there were a few of us so we were able to each order different things and share.    Funny \"AYCE\" place.",

Pretty much lots of sushi selection and the best part is you can order a half roll which is really nice so you can try different ones.

Our server was on point and so was Ivan, our sushi chef. He was easy to talk to and very personable.  He made us some amazing rolls. He asked us what we liked and made us some off the menu rolls that were incredible.  Everything tasted great, I highly recommended you stop by andgive it a try.  ****The super white tuna was my favorite. It just melts in your mouth (not in your hands).",

We got there at opening but were greeted and seated right away and our drinks ordered within minutes. Food and drinks were brought quickly and timely. The servers were personable and chit chatted with us as well and it was very chill. We were there for close to two hours. The prices- great. Lunch AYCE for 21.95 and drinks. We payed little over 100 not including tip for 4 people.   The Food-Spicy Edemame alone was delicious and spicy! We ended ordering about 10 rolls-4 people so don't judge. The baked scallops alone with all the rolls were delicious.  Dessert was the mochi- strawberry and mango. Next time I want sushi here we will come back for sure. We walked out stuffed!",

Only open for two months!? You would swear these guys have been at it for decades.  The sushi is spot on and fresh.  The menu is full of legit items.  The best part? ALL YOU CAN EAT FOR $26!  I will always come here when ever I'm in town! My tip? Get the all you can eat, sit at the bar, tell them to make whatever they want and watch the magic happen.  You will not be disappointed.

Jun has opened a great place with remarkable service and great tasting food.  Some people have complained about the wait time, He has hired more peeps and the wait time has been cut down considerably.  For the value and the great taste and cuts of fish, you can't beat Sushi Way.  The hamachi Kama is huge and full of meat.  Poke is great.  hand rolls are wonderful and the Negiri sushi is like any other nice sushi place you would go.  His play on tempura shrimp (coconut tempura shrimp) is great also.  For the value and the great food, I highly recommend Sushi Way.  Don't forget the honey bread dessert!",

There's only a few things you can't order on the menu but everything else is fair game and they have a pretty good sized menu.  Had tuna, yellowtail, unagi and octopus sushi, all good and what seemed to be pretty fresh fish.  Also had a few rolls along with some miso soup and edamame, all were good.  We were stuffed when we left and the bill was under $50.  Dinner AYCE is $26.95 if I remember correctly and you do only have one hour but we would have spent probably three times what we did if that was a strip hotel sushi joint. Have to remember this place for when I'm working at the convention center, just down the road (in a strip mall across from the Hughes center, next to the old Firefly location).",

    "text": "We must have come here on a bad night but I was extremely disappointed in this place. We came here on a Friday night and there were only three other tables here so we were seated immediately.  The waitress gave us only a couple minutes before asking if we were ready. This was obviously our first time here so we politely told her we needed a couple more minutes. That didn't stop her for checking in every five minutes until we finally ordered.  My friends and I decided to only order a couple rolls since we weren't super hungry for AYCE. I ordered the TNT roll which was good, but we had problems when it came to my Candy Cane roll. The description stated that it would have spicy soft shell crab, spicy crab, cucumber and tuna and yellowtail ( I think) on the outside. Well, when I got my roll it was super tiny, not even as big as a quarter! I saw the cucumber on the inside but it was surrounded by regular imitation crab! Sushi is my favorite food by the way guys so I know the difference between spicy crab, regular crab, and soft shell crab.   I decided to try one piece just to be sure, but sure enough there was no soft shell crab and there was no spice at all! I politely tell our waitress that I believe the soft shell crab is missing and she takes my plate away to talk to the sushi chef. However, when she returns to the table she asks me, \" Do you even know what soft shell crab is?\" Then she explains that the chef said that there is soft shell crab in there and I should be able to taste the crunchiness throughout the roll.   I am not an idiot! I should have taken a picture for evidence but it seriously just looked like a California roll with no avocado and tuna/yellowtail on top.  The service is horrible here!",

They have an a la carte option, but you may as well do the AYCE due to the variety, bring friends to maximize the experience.  Great date place or anniversary/birthday. If you truly love sushi - do yourself a favour and come here - Their roles are very unique and diverse. No res required for groups of 4 or less, except weekends/special holidays, but definitely make them for more than 4 persons, no one likes to wait!",

At this point I am Stttttaaaaarvvvvinngg!!!  whatever  go in, sit at the bar - they explain to me that for lunch it's $21.95 for 60minutes - no holds barred - anythign and everything on the menu goes  you want edamame? sure you want 10 spicy tuna rolls? sure you want a really complicated roll of your own making? (i think so)  in any case - as i sit there, overwhelmed with this menu - and starving, sushi chef asks if i'm ready... i say while i look, let's start with a spicy tuna roll  [listen - i've had amazing omakase nigiri sushi, but that's not what i'm expecting here - let's be realistic]  it comes pretty quickly - and i'm actually pleasantly surprised  for the next 35 minutes, i order 6 more rolls roll after roll  one from the softshell crab section one from the eel section couple from the shrimp tempura section  the special rolls are massive  and they are all DELICIOUS  i was incredibly nervous of spending my first evening in Vegas explaining to my buddies that i ate a lotta strip mall sushi and was spending the night in my hotel room worshipping the porcelain gods... no such thing!  after 35 minutes i had zero room for dessert or anything else (it was still included - and i still had another 25mins to go)  but all things being equal, for $21.95 - i definitely think i came out a winner one of the best value / best lunches I've had in Vegas...

I left Sushi Way following a very satisfying lunch.   Came for lunch and opted for the AYCE option which was around $22. It wasn't crowded during my hour or so here which meant I got my orders to me really quickly. Order a whole bunch of things but what stood out included the sashimi salad, the rock n roll cucumber roll, and the seared salmon nigiri. Overall the nigiri and rolls were pretty fresh and generous with the seafood. The sushi tacos were interesting but perhaps a bit too tart.   I think the spread is better at Sakana but the service here is more personable - everyone was absolutely lovely from the mom-like hospitality of the proprietress to the enthusiasm of the young chef behind the counter. Really enjoyed lunch here.",

I thoroughly enjoyed the all the nigiri here, they even have Salmon Belly in the AYCE! - Fresh Scallops were very good....one of the best I had at an AYCE - Loved the Sushi Nachos...very creative with tons of flavor. - Bacon Scallop skewer was tiny...gone in a couple of bites... - The Salmon Tar Tare was gone in one bite as well...creative and tasty!  The service is decent. This is where they get docked the .25 Stars...lol There is a Korean lady that is a bit rough around the edges... For dessert I asked her for the Green Tea Tempura...but instead got the regular ice cream...wasn't really interested in making a big deal about it...its fine.  Other that than...Nothing to really complain about...  I will be back.",

The staff was super attentive and quick to help and bring the orders at a steady pace. Definitely worth it if you're getting all you can eat. Speaking on that, you SHOULD just get your money's worth and get AYCE, because they have a variety of different cuts, rolls, sashimi, fish, yada yada all that good stuff to try. Literally the WHOLE menu is available when you do AYCE. You could try literally one of everything if you were that hungry.  The location is great, not too far off the strip. If you've got a mean Japanese food and Sushi craving it's definitely a spot to check out. I'm a big Salmon guy, so the cuts on the Salmon Nigiri were premium to me. Probably got like 10 orders of it to be honest. So whether you're a local or you're in town, save some money on the expensive restaurants on the strip and get some premium grub at Sushi Way!",

I was excited to try this place after looking through photos but I really should've looked at the reviews too.  We probably waited about 10 minutes for a table of 2 on a Tuesday night and was seated at the bar where we were greeted by what seemed to be not so fresh fish. We decided to order a few dishes to give it a try so that we could just leave after if we didn't like it.  Tried a couple rolls, nigiri and it didn't take us long to both agree to get the check and leave. I would say, spend a couple more bucks for better fish or just stay away completely..   Service was okay, didn't experience any problems, but it wasn't impeccable either.",

Blame it on the hot Vegas weather or the stress from moving her into her new college apartments. We were weighed, we were measured and we were found wanting. Oy! We only lasted 3 rounds, and even with that we couldn't finish what we had ordered. The nice server dude must have sensed our utter defeat and told us we didn't have to force ourselves. Still THE best place in LV for AYCE Sushi. Bring your patience though...the parking sucks here.",

I also scratch my head why I somehow crave for it when in Vegas. With all that said, I think Sushi Way is the way when you catch yourself in the same predicament as myself.   You are in Sin City after all so go eat all you can for less than $25 (kids are half price) for lunch. Their menu is extensive from rolls and nigiris to cooked items like shrimp tempura, grilled pork belly, and what-have-you. The fish may not be the freshest but you know they make it fresh before serving. Ha! I had my heart's content with all the salmon, red snapper, and yellowtail sushi without getting food poisoning. That's a plus! The fish to rice ratio won't make you fill up fast allowing you to enjoy some of their rich and hearty rolls. Our party of 12 almost tried everything on the menu while our server happily obliged with every request and additional orders we made. Heck, the bill was paid and we still wanted more mochi ice cream and they gave it to us. Can you complain? No way!",

I recommend making reservations so you don't have to wait.  Most of the fish tasted fresh except for a couple that I can't recall. I enjoyed the yellow tail, uni, amaebi, other nigiri, etc. The only thing that annoyed me was that our orders were not complete. Some items never came out, some extra came out, and some just came out way too late. Our server had a good attitude and tried his best so it wasn't too bad. To me, this place deserves 4 stars.",

Their fish is so fresh and the ratio to fish ratio for the nigiri couldn't be more perfect. I've been to many AYCE sushi places where they fail to get the ratio right - most times way too much rice for the sliver of fish. We had the yellowtail, super white, garlic tuna, salmon and salmon belly nigiri that was just so incredibly fresh you would think they caught it themselves.  The downside though, the service was a little on the slow side to the point where we would wait so long for what we ordered that by the time we actually received our food, we completely forgot we ordered it. Also, on our night they charged another parties payment (probably about 11 AYCE dinners) on our card.",

    "text": "Summary: Usually, all you can eat sushi is a hard sell for me. I feel like when you go to these places you are always sacrificing quality for quantity. However, Sushi Way proved me wrong... I just get how they are still in business selling such good fish at an all you can eat price!    Atmosphere: (4 stars) - This place is definitely a hole in the wall style joint located in a strip mall just off the strip. However with that said, it was well appointed, clean, and just big enough to fit everyone that it needs to.   Food: (5 Stars) - High-quality fish... I know... at an all you can eat place?! I know... but seriously, everything we had was great. I wish I could pinpoint a few of my favs, but we honestly had like 20 rolls. If I had to pick my favorite, it would easily be the Salmon Belly. It was so tender.   Service (4 stars) - Despite being very busy, our order arrived quite fast. The server was super helpful, and the service was exactly what was expected.  Value (5 Stars) - 100% yes.  Would I go back - 100% yes.",

Their entire menu is available for AYCE, with the exception of a few items listed in red print. The standout for me was the White Fish Tuna. You must order it!! I got 4 orders, it was so good! Other standouts were the Salmon Belly, Boom Boom and the Rock and Roll! The service was great and the restaurant was clean. The mochi ice cream was meh, nothing great. Overall, I'd definitely be back the next time in Vegas!",

    "text": ", came here with a friend during CES. This is one of the worst experiences of My Life. The Sushi was okay I guess that's the best thing that you could say about this place. So the customer service and the management is horrible. First of all they have their son maybe two or three years old maybe stick in the corner watching his little cell phone while they works. You can definitely tell these parents don't care anything about their child. Anyway on to the main part of the it was. This issue was good and that's only because of sushi chef was great, and he probably wouldn't be working here if you knew his real self worth and you can probably get a better job. After learning Sushi we ask for the bill bill came out to a hundred and someone not changed. Once we got the change we gave $140 so we can have extra money to tip and ask for change. It took half an hour before having to ask for the money back and they said hey you only 20. Oh no I've never been to such a disappointing placed as far as management goes I definitely would not come back here again it's a waste of time you could definitely find better Sushi I would definitely recommend Sushi Mon right down the street",

    "text": "One again, I ordered delivery from this establishment. I have never visited the restaurant in person, and I will limit my review to order accuracy, presentation and food quality.  So, regarding order accuracy: FAIL This is the oddest part of my whole experience. I ordered, among other things, halibut nigiri. Eat24 called me a few minutes after I placed my order and informed me that they were out. I asked them to replace it with an order of yellowtail. What I received, besides my tuna order, which was fine, was 1 order of unagi (which I did order), 1 order of yellowtail (I think), and one order of salmon!!! And I was billed for a yellowtail roll; 2 dollars more than the yellowtail nigiri that I ordered as a replacement! Eat24 did a great job repairing the mistakes, but it's quite clear that Sushi way is not yet prepared to accept delivery orders.  Presentation: D+ Not one effort was made to present an attractive delivery order. Plain standard styro boxes with no adornments; not even that annoying plastic grass! I ordered wasabi and ginger for three and only got a quarter-sized serving of each. They did have the more expensive throw-away chopsticks though; that got 'em from a \"d\" to a \"d+.\"   Food quality: C My husband loved the tuna; deep red, with very little sinew, and generous fish slices. However, as I've said many times, the heart of sushi isn't fish, it's the rice. And Sushi Way's rice isn't good. No coherence, and if you order some sushi that has a special sauce, like a ponzu instead of the standard soy, they put it directly on the fish before sending it out. Guess what the rice is like when you finally get it! Yep, soggy, no cohesion, very difficult to eat. But again, the quality of the fish was very good.  The bottom line? Clearly, the person who was responsible for contracting with Eat24 didn't consider the ramifications of offering sushi for delivery. I hope the person who is in charge of social media will instruct the staff on proper delivery prep and technique. And yes, presentation. I will order from them again, with prejudice though.",

    "text": "My new favorite AYCE sushi restaurant! This place is #1 if you wanna enjoy some good sushi in Las Vegas.  Previously, Goyemon sushi was my #1 for a long time, but my experience here today has taken that spot for sure.  I've tried many AYCE sushi places (Kaya, sushimon, doh, sushi twister, umiya, Yama, just to name a few) but this place takes the cake.  Food was excellent. The nigiri, rolls, and appetizers were a much bigger portion than I thought and was a welcome surprise. The textures and flavors were on point, and I've gained a new favorite nigiri, the garlic yellowtail.  There is a good selection on this menu that is tasty and much more different from other AYCE places.  That honeybread is something I've never seen in other AYCE places and tasted great on top of that.  Service was great. The food came out at proper times and the waitresses and chefs were awesome.  Kudos to them for their hard work and dedication!  All in all, one of the best experiences at a sushi restaurant. I gotta thank my buddy for recommending this place to me, otherwise I would've never known abut it.  I can't wait to come back.  Other AYCE sushi restaurants need to step up their game if they want to unseat Sushi Way as my #1 AYCE sushi restaurant.",

Most food came out relatively fast. A great way to try new sushi. Oyster was good for the first order but the next order was luke warm and had murky water in the shell. We told the waitress and she just took it away and probably didn't tell anyone. Kalbi was like warm but flavorful. Baked salmon roll was good. Screaming orgasm was just ok. We didn't think the special orgasm sauce was that unique.   Service- waitresses were very nice but disorganized. Maybe there were new? When we reordered food from the waitress she told us she wasn't our waitress and to wait for ours. However she was the one who took our original order. She said she was just helping the other waitress out since it was busy and then she decided to take our order. Just odd but she was nice about it. We ordered uni for the table right when we arrived. when we were done and trying to figure what we had not received yet, we asked when it was coming and they said they were out. They should have told us that from the get go. So full but hot dessert since it was included. Mango mochi did not have any flavor.   Overall good for sushi and would come back and recommend.",

First, I'll say that it's AYCE Sushi, so it's difficult to go below three stars just based upon that fact alone.  $26.95 for the dinner is what we paid for each person.  They have a tremendous selection of rolls along with all the other standard menu items.  Unfortunately, the service is lacking, and I got a sense that the fish and the food wasn't entirely fresh, because the rolls and fish were coming apart in certain areas and there was a slight discoloring.  In terms of the service, we were well into round two before we got the drinks we ordered, and it wasn't very busy on a Tuesday evening.  If you want a sushi fix, I'd say this is a good, economical place, but if you want to take it to the next level, take your ass elsewhere.",

The fish was amazingly fresh - you can tell by the taste and the colour of the tuna and salmon. They offer 2 pieces of uni sushi (which is unheard of in Toronto) and 2 oysters as a part of their AYCE menu as well as other specialty items. Service was quick and friendly, location had plentiful parking and everything was clean. Great job :)  I highly recommend the Poke Salad (spelled poki on the menu)",

The sushi tastes fresh which is more than I can say for a lot of AYCE sushi places. There is also a wide variety of food which was awesome. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth from eating here, compared to the other overpriced Vegas restaurants.  The restaurant is really clean and the service is super friendly. My server was Jane and she was really accommodating and incredibly nice! I went with a bunch of friends and she took care of us. I would definitely recommend this place to any friends or family who are ever in Vegas and wants to eat at a good sushi place. It's really close to the Strip too, so if you are ever on a Vegas trip, it would be worth to make a small detour to eat here.",

    "text": "When my friends and I first walked in, we were kind of turned off because no one was there to greet us and we ended up standing around waiting for about 5-10 minutes. A Korean lady walked in the dining room though and seated us. We thought she was kind of unfriendly at first but she definitely warmed up to us throughout the meal and started joking with us and being really sweet.   Throughout our meal, the service was prompt (both water and food) and the quality of the fish was really, really good. I'm a big nigiri fan and I definitely enjoyed the salmon and scallop the most. There are also many categories of rolls on the back and I liked the Fat Ass (a deep fried roll) even though it's one of those rolls where one piece is too big for your mouth but at least it's appropriately named. A lot of the roll names are laced with sexual innuendo but our waiter would just joke about it and have a good time with us.   Overall, a great meal and definitely worth the $21.95 for lunch and lunch is 'til 4 PM! The menu says there's a 60 minute limit but we were definitely full before the limit since the food would come out quickly. The only thing I didn't love about this sushi joint was that you have to look through the menu and list every verbally for the waiter. I'm accustomed to writing everything down on a piece of paper which I think is more efficient since you don't have to memorize your order.",

    "text": "Came on the strength of yelpers recommendation & this place was definitely well with its stars. I sat at their bar which was nice.  The wait staff were very courteous & checked in for both drinks & food rounds - always worthy of an extra star in my opinion.   A roll or 2 never came out but the rolls I did ask after came out promptly. I was putting in a constant stream of small orders so honestly I kind of forgot until I was pretty full.  Sashimi is not available (maybe if you're putting in a very special request? And obviously pay more for it) The 2 sushi chefs were quick, nice (I was sitting right in front of them) & kept things moving. I heard them talk with guests & communicate cheerfully with the wait staff so that was well worth a star to me - positive work environment which made me & my meal feel happy, deliciously positive.   They have a good mix of the traditional rolls & their sensually named specialty rolls.  Their rice to roll contents ratio was decent with no extra uneven rice to purposefully fill you up. Their sushi rice was moist & sticky & commoners the fish very well.  They had a good selection of appetizers & cooked rolls which is important for someone in the group whom may be adverse to eating so much raw fish. The menu also states that you can ask the chef to make your own roll if you'd like something slightly different (or modified) from the menu.    Their sweet shrimp nigiri is different in a good way as that I've never had it, it was indeed sweet & delicious but I definitely couldn't have handled a full order.  I lloved that they accomodated my requests for only 1 nigiri (vs the 2 per order) so there is no waste. I love that they seem willing to accommodate guests request for special orders.    That coconut shrimp tempura is amazing.  Light, not too much batter nor coconut overkill.  The one thing i didn't enjoy was the calamari tempura but then I've never found a Japanese place that's done a great calamari...  Definitely will come again when I am down in the area again & bring my appetite. Hopefully the service will still be just as good or even better.",

I thought!  First: all but one of our half order of rolls came to the table as full rolls.... (we ordered half rolls) filling us up quickly... Second: they started delivering food we didn't order to the table.  Third: we ordered 7 orders of chef's choice \"Omakase\" after 40 minutes of waiting we finally got our omakase and it was 7 orders of the same thing.. not a variety even the waiter thought it shouldn't of been all one thing....   This was horrible... the service was astoundingly bad.

Typical all you can eat sushi packs the rice and adds slivers of low quality fish. I was really craving sushi and was staying at a hotel next door for work so I chose to stay and am beyond happy that I did.  Sushi Way is an all you can eat like I've never seen. Unique rolls packed with outstanding fish, thick cuts of tuna layering the tops of rolls. To say I was surprised is an understatement.  The fire sauce on the Kiss of fire roll was  perfectly blazing and what ever it is made of is outstandingly tasty.  The sushi chefs are friendly and talkative while even working hard and the owner/manager walked the tables to make sure everything was the way it should be. This place is leaps and bounds above yama sushi. It will not disappoint!",

We also really liked their \"Alaska\", \"I Love Sushi\" rolls. They also have specials that should not be missed if the have it. Specifically the \"Salmon Belly\" and the not to be missed \"Boom Boom Special\" (a mouthful of taste explosion followed with a slow burn).  All of the fish appeared to be fresh and was tasty. The staff was helpful and made some great suggestions.  The next time we come back to Vegas we will definitely reserve a time to eat the Sushi Way.",

FOOD CAME SO FAST and they were so nice about it !!! The best rolls are the sushi lover's, Johnny, Japanese lasagna- all mindblowing! They have the best super white tuna (you can ask for it without the vinegar thing) and EBI shrimp nigiri ofcourse! For the dessert PLEASE GET THE HONEY BREAD !!! Oh my gosh, everything was amazing especially service !

    "text": "I'll be the contrarian and say this place way underwhelmed me, except for the price. After reading the reviews I had high hope, and didn't mind spending $20 for the Lyft round trip.   In an AYCE setting the owner and the customers' objectives are polar opposites. The owner wants to limit his/her damage without being too obvious. As I get older quality takes precedence over quantity, but I keep forgetting that.  The good: Sea urchin is fresh, the salmon has a rich taste. The waitress is nice. Unfortunately the list ends here.   The less than ideal: Sea urchin, sweet shrimp, tuna sashimi and oyster are only one per dinner order. But for the price they are charging I can understand that. For the sweet shrimp they were supposed to serve the head tempura style. There were only two waitresses so they were overwhelmed in an AYCE setting where the customers made repeat orders.   The bad: All other fishes are not as fresh (likely previously hard frozen) and are almost tasteless. It is also half the thickness I am used to (granted the rice is also on the small side). Hence the nigiri lacks balance. The salmon roe and smelt roe are way too salty. Oyster is not fresh, which is kind of hard. Oysters on half shelf are either fresh or spoiled so it puzzled me why the taste was off yet not spoiled. The wasabi has no kick at all - something really hard to screw up. All rolls had faked crab legs basked in mayonnaise in the center, and more creamy sauce on top. Two of those one can call it a night.  To add insult to injury I felt sick and threw up afterwards.",

So glad I came in! The selection for lunch is not cut short from the dinner menu. Everything that a person can get at dinner, they can get at lunch. The options include lots of appetizers as well as deserts with the dozens of sushi roll options. I really enjoyed the couple of riceless rolls I tried, especially the Johnny roll-would HIGHLY recommend it! The roll has a perfect mix inside and the \"orgasm sauce\" is to die for! The egg roll was great-and is vegetarian friendly. I also really enjoyed the Hot & Juicy roll-it is an explosion of flavors in your mouth, and not too spicy, but still provides a great little kick! The rainbow roll was also delicious and had great filling and the topping is thick! I had a few other rolls, but those were the ones that stood out most. I finished with one mango and one strawberry mochi, which were a great palette cleanser. The service was quick and friendly. I look forward to coming back here any time I come to Vegas!",

Truly fresh sushi and they don't over stuff the fish with rice; unlike so many other places. We liked it so much we had it 3 days in a row!! The atmosphere inside was very nice and the lady taking care of us made us feel at home. She recommended different speciality roles for us to try, it all tasted great!!",

Pros:  - Sweet Shrimp nigiri (probably the best thing we had that evening) - nigiri section overall...just the right fish and rice ratio - baked green mussels   Cons:  - kamikaze dynamite...too greasy and salty - salmon killer...the baked spicy salmon on the inside was a tad bit on the dry side  Other than those two, this place is definitely worthwhile",

    "text": "FAN. TAS. TIC! My reviews are probably 80% sushi, and those probably don't cover the OTHER 80% of times I flat out forget to check in. Also mostly for sushi. I'm a G.D. sushi fiend..... across 7 states probably 30 major cities I've had a couple metric F tons of sushi in my life. If I didn't already live in Vegas I'd move here for this restaurant. If I ever leave, I will regrettably become an out of towner who comes here 3-4 times a year just to take in the restaurant and gaming scene. It will be for this restaurant alone. Let's start with the basics- apps, The dynamite was incredible. Note, it is smaller than a lot of places sell dynamites. Big things come in small packages. Cucumber w/ crab salad, very very light on the sauce (vinegar) over the cucumber and it was very refreshing! Jalapeno Popper, I will say this one was a tad underwhelming, but I honestly can't put my finger on why. The Jalapeno was fried nicely, good amount of cream cheese not overpowering, the batter was crisp, and the sweet sauce they had on it was amazing, but the sum of it's parts somehow missed the mark. More research is needed =p Nigiri- I liked how fast they came and the quality of them were out of this world. Had to order a dragon roll, pretty basic, what most sushi places should be judged on. It was phenomenal. Again, very fresh, but more than that, it just tasted light and refreshing. It has to be a great balance with how much (little) rice-vinegar there was. A lot of places will be a tad heavy handed with it causing the rice to gum up ever so slightly making it sit harder on your stomach. This place didn't do that and it made a world of difference. I ordered the Go rebel roll, the Sunny Special, and the Chicago Fire. Once again I have to hammer home just how fresh all the fish was, and with the variety they had going on for these rolls I would have suspected one or two pieces to bring something down but nothing ever did. The staff were great, all smiles and helpful. The chefs were superb. Nitpicking (HATE THAT WORD!!) at a few things here and there if you really want to, but I truly don't have any single thing that turned the experience bad. I have to move on from my old sushi joint. Gotta go down Sushi Way!",

    "text": "Review #095 - 2017  We showed up on Monday night, May 1st, around 11 PM and asked for a table for five, three adults and two babies.  The place was pretty much empty except for one other table who were getting ready to finish up and leave.  We had the whole place to ourselves so our food was made pretty quickly.  We started off with a few different rolls and nigiris.  I'm more of the sashimi eater, but my friends were more into the specialty rolls so it made it a little difficult to share with them so we ended up ordering a bunch of separate items.  I think my personal favorite would have to be the super white.  It was very tasty, plus the fact that there's no rice was a bonus.  I ordered 3 orders which consisted of 3 pieces per order.  I think I ate 2 orders to myself.  The bacon scallop skewers were also tasty.  Even my 1-year old daughter had a bite and didn't spit it out.  She also enjoyed a few strands of noodles from the udon noodle soup, which I thought the broth was kind of salty.  The screaming orgasm did not live up to its name at all.  I think they must have misnamed it because I was not feeling the orgasm.  Sorry, TMI!  Glad they limited it to just one order per person because I would've been greedy & ordered more just because of the name.  Haha  The salmon skin hand roll was really dry so I took quite a while to finish it, but everything else that I ordered was good.  The food is probably a 3.5 at best, but I bumped it up to a 4.5 because our waitress was the best that I'd ever encountered.  She was super friendly and accommodating.  I don't think I've ever met anyone who's so good at doing their job.  Sadly, I didn't get her name.",

Of course at around 5pm on a Wednesday is when I entered the restaurant. Believe it or not I was the only one in the whole restaurant sitting at the sushi bar.   Tho the sushi chefs were attentive to my needs the waitress for appetizers orders were not as attentive in my opinion. It started out as very attentive then shift changed the the new waitresses was not as attentive as the previous one. Otherwise it would have been a perfect 5 stars.   I wanted to try all their nigiri to test out their freshness, it was a hit and miss. They had salmon belly for the special black board special and it was delicious and unlike some places they didn't limit you which was nice. The fish to rice ratio to me was right on very little rice.    My favorite nigiri's that I tried 1. Squid 2. Octopus 3. Eel 4. Tomago 5. Plain tuna  6. Halibut 7. Albacore 8. Yellow tail   I also tried their gyoza, kalbi and pork belly all very delicious.   I also tried few half rolls cow boy roll was ok, big easy special roll was delicious. I was by myself so it was hard to try many rolls but they did offer half rolls and it wasn't packed with rice but very tightly packed small amount of rice in the rolls. The rolls were very skinny compared to most places in Vegas .  I honestly would rate this place one of the top 5 best all you can eat sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.  If your not familiar with the area or just visiting it's very hard to miss the turn into park. The lot was spacious and you must turn into the \"the park 3900\" plaza on corporate st.",

All the rolls are delicious. You get oysters, mussels and galbi beef option, too! You can even order mini udon, shrimp tempura, etc. Goyemon and Sushi Mon are good, too, but everything is sitting on top of a California roll. This one actually has great rolls filled with all different things. Soft shell crab, tuna, etc. Also, the one thing I love is they have kids prices. $14.95 for kids! I'll pay that price as opposed to the other places where you have to pay full price for kids. And if you have a kid that doesn't want sushi, you can pay a la carte. Yeah!!! Love it here!",

Richard tries to catch you off guard so you can say \"I love my ass\" (name of a roll) haha. Look out for him, he's awesome!   The presentation for the rolls were absolutely stunning especially the \"cherry blossom\" roll (beware this roll is loaded with avocado). They didn't drench the rolls with sauces and the fish tasted pretty fresh. All the rolls we ordered were delicious. The chicken teriyaki bento was worth it! So definitely try that too!

I give them 3.5 stars.   The sushi nigiris were okay. I think, the best one would be the super white. However, the consistency in making it isn't constant. My first nigiri had just a bit of spicy drizzle on top. My second nigiri was soaking in sauce. :/  In terms of freshness... the fish on the sushi nigiris did taste like they kinda had been on ice for a few hours. For ex. the salmon nigiri was kinda dull in complexion, it wasn't shiny. It tasted a bit milky but wasn't as milky as the other ones I've tried in other Ayce.   The tuna in the tuna salad had a weird consistency. Unlike chopped tuna I've tried before... their tuna was kinda gelatin in consistency. It didn't taste bad but the consistency was throwing me off.  I also tried their sushi nachos. I think that's my favorite out of everything I've tried. However, they soaked it too much with sauce. :/ They should just have a side sauce for the sushi nachos.   Because of reviews online... I ended up wanting to try their honey bread. OMG. It was super sweet. They shouldn't have drizzled it with honey and then chocolate syrup. The bread itself was already sweet. I should have just ordered a scoop of green tea ice cream. Sigh.   Service was fast, which I was happy about. However, they weren't that busy that day.",

It needs a little kick to it. They do have big portions of fish on the nigiri though and cooked items are not bad either.  On the other hand, the service wasn't quite there, they need more uplifting spirited ppl working there. Waiters was kinda ehhh....its not good for a start up business and the layout or lighting was not welcoming, it felt cold but hope all is well for this business . Oh lastly , they said fresh oysters on the menu wasn't fresh at all... It smelled like rotten seafood that my husband couldn't eat it so I had to eat it all and the consequences wasn't good.... :(  will I return? Maybe in the future to see if any improvements on food and place.",

I did a quick yelp search of what was closest to our hotel and found this spot with 5 stars .   To say the least, we were really blown away by the top-notch service, unique flavors and fresh selection at Sushi Way. The salmon tartar, poke and sashimi were all solid. In addition our waiter was so kind to offer all the best recommendation. Some of the unique things we tried were the Sexy Lady (topped with coconut) and the Carrot top ( topped with fried carrots). I was really impressed to see some of these dishes that have never been done before.    This will likely be my new \"go to\" spot when I make the trip out again. Hats off to the staff for a job well done!",

The food is amazing. But the service.... well it's impeccable. Sun was our waitress and while we were not the easiest because my husband has a shellfish allergy we needed some serious accommodations, she made it happen. She allocated a single chef to us to make his food so that it would not be mixed with shellfish. Even though this was not an easy task she made sure to get it done. We greatly appreciate it. There was  also a bus girl and i didn't catch her name but she was super friendly and on top off things. Oh and did I mention this place has all you can eat for $26. No joke. You can have as many things as you want off the menu.  It was a really good meal for an amazing price with excellent service. We will be back!!!",

I'm basically rating this a 3 because of a couple things. AYCE sushi is one of my favorite things to eat and I always order the same things I would get at other establishments and compare them to each other. I feel like everything here is covered in eel sauce or yum yum or ponzu here. it's not a bad thing but it's also not a good thing. I really like those flavors but when every dish seem to taste the same it gets boring. rice doesn't stay together on the nigiri and that's a big no no. the fish quality was ok it wasn't the best. I also think that the people that are working here need to be a little more educated on sushi we asked the waitress if she knew what deep fried shrimp heads were and she acted like we were crazy to mention it like what is that? Lol kinda funny but I think they have the location to get the people in but I think there are many other sushi places that are way better than this place. oh I will say my favorite thing here was the salmon skin handroll.",

Had the Hamachi Kama that was added on the chalkboard and worth the $26.95 dinner price by itself.  Also had vegetable tempura, coconut shrimp, calamari, and miso soup that were par excellance as usual.  The Baked Mussels now have bacon added to the spicy mayo topping, didn't expect that but plesantly surprised, amd the oyster shooters were okay, but were at least cleaned and shucked.  They offer fresh wasabi upon request, a huge plus!  I had Damien put the Uni over Salmon roe on two Nigiri pieces and it was dee-lish!  Hint to future customers:  tip your sushi chef directly in cash, they'll show you how appreciative they are for it.  Sadly, I heard Choo Choo left to start his own restaurant, but Jun (the Owner) has his cool AYCE sushi joint adequately staffed.",

The problem that I have with  restaurants (provided, of course, that their food is well-done- fresh, good proportions, variety of ingredients, decent-sized pieces, & preferrably at least a couple of rolls that set them apart from their competitors) is that I tend to find 1 or 2 rolls that I particularly like, but I don't want to have to travel from 1 place to the next to get a full meal. Plus, I prefer AYCE- takes the stress off.   This place is my current favorite- living up to my requirements, plus having several interesting rolls.    The only suggestion I would make is to add a dessert roll. Preferably something with bananas   Professional but fun staff. Even when they are painfully understaffed, tgewy manage to be pleasant & friendly (I've only seen this happen once). Sit at the bar for a more personal experience",

I ordered the Kiss of Fire roll, it was amazing and spicy which I loved but I wish the roll was bigger. Kids had California rolls and they liked it.  My son is a pretty good eater and he didn't get full. He's 10. Husband ordered the Hawaii roll and was unhappy because the fish wasn't fresh and the roll was too small so he was disappointed. Don't think we'll be back.",

The rolls were decent, we tried the following:  Rolls-  Tiger Shrimp Lover Freaky Friday Baked Salmon Spider Hot and Juicy Lisa Hand Roll  Appetizers-  Cucumber Crab Salad Seaweed Salad Screaming Orgasm Sweet and Spicy Potstickers Tempura Calamari  Dessert-  Strawberry Mochi duh  Like I said the rolls were decent but I'm sad to say we will not be returning due to the horrendous wait time to receive rolls.  There was a time we waited 28 minutes for a roll.   I get they only had two sushi chefs but there were times when we saw rolls waiting for ten plus minutes to be picked up and taken to tables. It's unfair to blame the chefs when they're doing their job.",

We were there for over 3 hours altogether, waiting 15 plus minutes between each roll!  We decided to try it again last week, just in case that one time was a fluke. BAD IDEA. After sitting for over 20 minutes and only getting a hand roll and some tempura shrimp, my husband couldn't take it anymore. We paid for what we had eaten and told the girl we were leaving. She told us AGAIN that their sushi cutter had called in sick. Ridiculous.  We left and went to Sakana and had amazing service and sushi. There are so many great AYCE sushi places in Vegas, but this is not one of them.",

The reason I knocked off one star is because of two things:  (1) with the small portion of the sushi, there's considerable amount of rice. I'm very picky with the fish to rice ratio. (ONLY applies to nigiri, not rolls) (2) it's quite dark inside. Most of lamps have those yellow halogen bulbs which makes everything look yellow and dim. Also, the bathroom toilet light bulb was out and it was hard to see the toilet paper.   Servers were very nice.",

I just didn't like much after that with the exception of the coconut shrimp tempura. Since my taste buds are off, I didn't take off for that. A couple of things to note that I didn't read anywhere. On the menu it said no leftovers. I thought it meant you could not take leftovers on AYCE. Makes sense. I found out that it meant you have to eat all the plate to get other things. Different than other AYCE I had gone to. You can share with anyone in your group getting AYCE too. Alas, I was traveling alone so I didn't have that advantage. The waitress was a bit rude about it but let me do leave some. So you must know you are going to like it before you order. I did half orders which helped but I don't know how I would know if I would have liked something new without tasting it. Wish it would have been explained better when I sat down espically since they get lots of tourists. With that said, I really liked the food and would go back now that I understand the rules better. The yellowtail tuna was like butter. I had like 8 pieces and it was hard to stop. Could not get enough.",

The fish was fresh; and fast, friendly service. Another good AYCE sushi option in Vegas. Go Monica!",

I would've given them 5 stars but the oyster took a long time to come out and also our last order consists of shrimp, sweet shrimp and tamago order. It took about 15 minutes gap in between. Service is good. You do have to ask for more tea from the server even tho you are paying $2.50 for hot tea. For dessert, we got honey toast and yuzu sorbet. Yuzu sorbet is a great way to finish the meal. Very light and refreshing! We were there for about 2 hours, longer than I wanted to but the food was good so can't complain much.",

    "text": "Came here last night (Wednesday) for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) offering. It was $26.99/person.   Service was very good. They were attentive and took my order quickly. There were minor mistakes (salmon hand roll wasn't placed the first time and they split up the check wrong but both were corrected quickly).   The oysters, galbi, seared tuna slices, uni nigiri, and sweet shrimp nigiri are only allowed 1 order per person which was ok due to price.  Oysters were decent (fresh enough, flavor good) but considering place and price, I'll say it's very good when it comes to bang for buck.   Uni and sweet shrimp was excellent in freshness and flavor.   Galbi was a lil over cooked (I like my beef bloody) for my taste but still very good.   The seared tuna slices was called Mouth Orgasm. I find it ok. Flavor was fair. Found the sear good enough.   Nigiri: Salmon roe wasn't good. The roe was a bit dehydrated. The yellowtail was good. Garlic yellowtail was delicious. Perfect balance of garlic and fish. Seared salmon was good but not mind blowing. The eel was excellent. Perfect sauce, eel, and rice balance. Halibut was ok. It was a lil tough for nigiri. Surf clam was very good, fresh and not tough. The fresh scallop was good. The mackerel itself was very good but unfortunately drenched in way too much vinegar that made it too sour and the rice was about to fall apart.   Rolls: I didn't have the one roll but I had a piece of the soft shell crab roll. That one was very good.   Handroll: Salmon skin was good but not my thing. I'm used to a lightly floured and fried savory salmon skin, really crispy in a handroll. This one was only slightly crispy drenched in some sweet, soy based sauce. The flavor was ok but I didn't like the sauce completely drenching the seaweed, making it soggy. If they didn't put so much sauce, I think I'd like it so much more and I'd highly recommend.   Seaweed salad: Would've been very good if the vinegar base sauce wasn't so sour. Need to not put so much sauce on things!  Tempura ice cream: I really enjoyed it as the fried batter was decently light. The ice cream was average. Overall, was too sweet for my taste but I still loved it.   Overall, I took away a star due to them putting way too much sauce on vinegar based pieces that made it hard to eat. From a bang for buck perspective, this place is definitely a 5 Star. Most things were fresh and for a AYCE, the fish quality was really good. It's expected that they don't use Japanese sushi rice with mirin. I've gone to numerous AYCE Japanese buffets in Hong Kong and US. This one has pretty good bang for buck ratio.",

I was expecting old low quality crap sushi but far from that! 100 times better than any Japanese buffet! Will most definitely return!!!

    "text": "Stopped by before heading back to Cali.... small cute place, it wasn't packed when we arrived for lunch so I was very surprised it took forever to get our food.  The rolls were ok, average size. We tried a good selection from the menu for the AYCE but nothing \"wow\" that stood out. The fried FAT ASS rolls were too fried, hard as a rock.  The only thing I didn't like was the service was s-l-o-w.... like unbelievably slow, the servers were nice but can't understand why it took so long for our rolls to be made. We waited over 10mins for the sushi nigiri.  When we come back to Vegas again, we'll probably find another sushi place to check out.",

Omg the fish is fresh and delicious, I ordered a sexy lazy roll and it was like the best that ever touched my lips. The nigiri is delicious and the sushi nacho was so unique and married sweet and spicy flavors really well.    Our server was attentive and funny and she gave good suggestions. I normally go to kaya because I get off at work at midnight and it's hard to find late night sushi places. I'm so happy we tried this place out, we're definitely coming back!!",

    "text": "OH SNAP!!   I am not going to lie, my favorite food is sushi and I have gone to so many sushi bars including non-ayce AND ayce and this place has to be the BEST AYCE SUSHI I have ever had in 20+ years of my life. This is my REAL and HONEST review. It is so unfortunate that I cant express and write everything on here on Yelp. JUST COME AND TRY IT YOURSELF.  Warning though, I think this restaurant is pretty new. You know what that means? The waiters and waitresses are soooooooo new and they are DEFINITELY not fully trained YET so they are freaking slowwwww. I mean REAL slow and even if you are trying to get their attention, they are caught up with whatever they are doing so wont give all their time to you, which is a bit upsetting.  But, let me talk about sushi now, after all, this place is AYCE sushi restaurant. OHEMGEE, the freshest fish ever!! Every piece I had at the day of my visit, had AWESOME flavor, cut and presentation. I was very very impressed. One thing that I really admired about this sushi bar was that they cut the fish after they get your order. Why is that surprising? Well, many of AYCE places have cut their fish in advance so that they can make sushi a lot faster to serve a big mass of people. I guess it is convenient for them but its not necessarily good for us. Fish can get dry and the taste will definitely be different. I dont know if that played a big role but my sushi tasted GREAT! I loved it and I ate so much.  Their hamachi was seriously the best I have ever had at any AYCE places. To top that hamachi, their AMAEBI WAS BOMB. I seriously have NEVER seen this AMAEBI QUALITY ANYWHERE (AYCE) before. Period. It was HUGE, MEATY and SWEET! I dont remember every one of them but everything I tried was so good. Their special for the night included Salmon Belly and DEAR, it was fatty and it just melted in my mouth. I love SALMON and it was just PERFECT.  Now shifting to the appetizers, I only tried one, Coconut shrimp tempura and I am soooo glad I ordered that because it was amazingly good. The sushi chef actually recommended it and I absolutely devoured it. In fact, I ordered twice!! I really like that they come out warm and super crispy, fresh out of the fryer. Again, not many places do this. They usually have a lot of them fried, and just kind of give it to us, semi-warm and it is never crispy. Batter was ultra thin and shrimp was large. There were just the right amount of coconut on the outside batter, and it was just sooooo good!  They have honey bread as one of the options in the desserts, which is very rare to find elsewhere. It was pretty good but please order it without the ice cream, whip cream and chocolate drizzle. I only like to eat the honey bread. It was crusty and tasted good. It would have been a lot better if I knew it was coming out like that with all the extra that I dont care about.  To make things short, you will never find this quality at any other AYCE restaurants. They are at their best right now especially since they just opened. I hope they keep it the same and never downgrade. I will definitely come back whenever I am coming back to Vegas! You locals are lucky to have AYCE places like Sushi Way",

Jenna -5-like the sweetness of the eel sauce, Sexy lazy Special -5,  DD -2.5-bland, and  sushi burrito -3.  Ok, so I can eat a lot. You can also order half rolls so you can try more AND I have a friend helping out. Here's some more.  Spicy tuna tar tare -3 not very spicy Salmon killer -4 Jose special -3.5 Volcano roll -4odd combo OMG -5 Garlic yellowtail -4 Candy Cane -4basic   Dessert time. Liked the honey bread but the pineapple sorbet was the perfect end to the meal.   Service is good for a place like this. Nice, accommodating waitress. A couple orders seemed to get lost. Not a big deal. The bathroom could use a lock. Luckily nobody walked in on me.  Overall you won't be disappointed here. Many of the rolls are very clever.

Well after a bit of research and people asking while hiking, this was my choice for my only real meal this trip to Vegas. Heard there were lots of shitty sushi places on the strip and this was a Vegas local favorite, just a short distance where tourists don't go. Well I have never been steered wrong with this advise.  Wow, in all honesty some of the best poke I have had that was not in  the south Pacific. Really really good quality tuna . The seared salmon app was pretty good as well.  Short ribs were decent. Salad, miso were pretty standard. Yellow tail was good, the escolar was good, I forget what it was called as I did not order it, but is was good.  I wish I could have eaten more, but man I'm  not so much the fat boy anymore.  In my raw fish experience this was really,really good. In Vegas,LA. or where ever, you blow a ton of cash for raw fish, but I'm not so sure it's worth it.  Let's  just use a bit of logic, in the USA where are you getting same day fish, cut real time?  So if you want good   fish at this price point, I'm pretty sure you can not do much better in a land locked desert paradise of sin, than what we experienced, and I know my raw fish.",

Rice was thick and not that good.  The only thing I thought was decent was the salmon sushi.    Dessert wasn't that great either.  They only allow you to get only one dessert, which I didn't realize when I ordered it.  I had the green tea ice cream, it was one little scoop and it was not a good, high quality green tea ice cream.  I also had the strawberry mochi, this was pretty good but it was only one piece cut in half.   Definitely wasn't worth the all you can eat buffet price and the long walk from the Mirage to get here.",

Food:  Fish was super fresh! I was in such shock since we are in the middle of a desert eating super fresh seafood. The rolls were well made. The sides were just as good. Must orders: Tempura, sweet shrimp, uni, salmon kama, salmon belly and scallop roll.   Service:  Super friendly staff who dropped by every few minutes to check up on us.   Environment:  This is set away from the strip. The place can fit 50 - 75 patrons. Plentiful parking and easy to get to.   Price: $28 for AYCE!! This is top notch quality sushi...I don't quite understand how they can charge $28 for all this.   I will be back! Perhaps everytime I'm in Vegas....  Food: 5 Service: 5 Environment: 4 Price: 5",

Objectively speaking, the food was great! The fish was really fresh and they carried a lot of unique options I haven't had at other places (like garlic hamachi). The uni/amaebi (one serving per customer) are a must!   Our experience was sub par due to the service that we experienced during dinner. The management should try to staff the restaurant accordingly every night. For a Friday night, you would expect more than 2 sushi chefs to accommodate customers, but the lack of staff resulted in a 40-45 minute wait for our first order of food. The server was courteous enough to provide 2 complimentary bottles of sake, but it wasn't enough to make up for the lack of service. Shout-out to the staff for working hard to make up for their inadequate management.   Food Quality: 4/5  Atmosphere: 4/5  Service: 1/5 (Will give the benefit of the doubt that it's not always like this, but for our particular experience, the service was terrible.)  Overall: 2/5",

    "text": "I was originally going to give this place 3 stars. I wanted to talk about the quality of the sushi and how good it is, and how the way they make their rice is amazing.  But, that changed this morning when my boyfriend texted me, telling me he had food poisoning. And I myself had been fighting an unpleasantness last night as well.   However, I want it to be clear that we wouldn't have come back anyways, even if we didn't get sick. The ambiance of this place is very dead, it's slightly depressing. There is no joy in the staff, with the exception of one server. It didn't start to get upbeat in the restaurant till a group of guys came in.   We thought that their nigiri tasted good, the sushi is of good quality, but we didn't like their rolls at all. The only thing you can taste in all the rolls is the unagi sauce, and it overpowers everything else. Their other sauces have no flavor, and the sushi is lost. I also want to add that their appetizers are mediocre. We had the Veggie tempura that we weren't impressed by, the Screaming Orgasm which has the same problem with no flavor and my boyfriends miso soup never arrived.   But once again, none of this matters anymore since my boyfriend woke up super sick, and my stomach has been upset as well.  I'm sorry Sakana for betraying you. Even though your rice isn't good sushi rice and you're always busy... you always treat us well, your staff is welcoming, and we always leave satisfied and never with food poisoning.",

    "text": "Zero stars if I could, for the amazingly poor service we received for our party of 16. Why bother accommodating a large party if you can't serve them? We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. Mind you, there were only 2 other parties of 2 who dined in throughout our reservation. So the restaurant was not all that busy.   Initially we had two servers who took orders from us in three sections (left, middle, right) and it was very unfortunate that somehow the middle section of our party got our first round of food about an hour after ordering. At the same time we got our first round, the other two sections were already being served their third round of orders-- note that our middle section only had 4 of us while the left and right section had 6 each. On top of that, the celebrant was sitting in the middle section where we barely ate. They used the excuse that the chef's had probably combined the nigiris on some plates and were given to other sections. If that was the case, what was the point in ordering by sections? That, I would say, was careless on their part. Had they served the orders to the sections who ordered them, we would have not been waiting for our food for so long. We (the middle section) were the only section to order eel and sea urchin, which honestly did not come out to any other section, but ours- a few minutes after reminding our server what our first order was. I was literally picking at the other section's food while waiting for our order. I cant stress you enough on how long that wait felt.  Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, at the end of the night, we ended up with only one server; one of them had disappeared making it a lot more difficult to get our orders in. We came in paying for AYCE + the 18% gratuity, but ate as if we did ala carte along with half-ass service, it was truly upsetting and frustrating.  The food itself? Mediocre. Miso soup was anything but. Pork belly was pretty good, but not sure if it just tasted good cause I was starving during that wait. They got one thing right though, and that was getting the right drinks to us in a timely matter.  I could only hope that this restaurant would improve on their customer service and be more prepared when taking large parties. I will most likely not be back here, as there are tons of other sushi joints in vegas I'd rather spend my time and money on. But good luck if you decide to dine in!  I think, for once, maybe it wouldn't have been a bad idea looking at this business' 141 not recommended reviews that also warn about their horrible service. ",

However, the execution of the sushi was lackluster. The rice was toothy and slightly too vinegary. The fish items tasted less that perfectly fresh. They lacked the creamy mouthfeel of higher grade sushi.  My favorite dishes was the salmon tartare app, which had salmon that was admittedly sliced improperly for tartare. It sat atop crab salad, diced red onions, and avocado. The dish was good in a grocery store sushi way: decent flavor combo, but ingredients tasted as if they had sat out a bit too long. Not unsafe food practices, just not fastidiously prepared.  The salmon roe tasted fresh and was tasty.   None of the dishes blew me away. It was just an OK meal. The service was prompt and cordial but not particularly caring or friendly despite how close I was to the sushi chefs.  I wouldn't recommend this place. Their reviews are high because the price is attractive for an AYCE near the vegas strip. Thr execution was poor.",

It's very soft and buttery. I also like how they don't put too much rice for the nigiri, allowing the fish to be the center of attention and not losing its nice taste. Food also comes out quite fast and consistently. In total my family paid $93 for a dinner of sushi witch would have cost $130 without buffet. I don't think I will find any other sushi buffet as good as this.",

There are plenty of smiles and people seem to truly be enjoying themselves.   The restaurant has wood tables and benches. There is a darkness with red hues in the lighting.

They have basic crab rolls and also fancier, more exciting rolls which are filling and look great.  Cuts, rolls, and basic maki.  Gyoza, dessert, salads...all included.  Sushi Way is your typical AYCE sushi spot that has many options but most are more or less the same ingredients.  Tasty and for the price well worth it if you're looking to stuff yourself on rice and fish.  I usually prefer to spend more on higher quality sushi, but Sushi Way is very solid nonetheless.  They also offer a la carte if you just want some sushi east of the strip at a cheaper price.  And, don't forget the awesome names of some of the rolls.  Might be worth a stop in here just for the fantastic comedic menu creations.",

Great Nigiri the quality of the fish is exceptional. Many amazing rolls and appetizers to choose from. Highly recommend getting the Yellowtail belly and Salmon belly if your into Nigiri.

The waitor was very friendly and suggested popular items from the menu which was very helpful.  I chose to have the all you can eat special that costs $26.95 @ night which was pretty resonable.  I came around 7:30pm and was seated immediately.  20 minutes later the entire restaurant was filled!  The sushi rolls were pretty good.  I had the Big Easy Special, Salmon Killer, and I love My Ass. Of those the Big Easy Special was my favorite. They made a mistake on my Unagi and gave me a Unagi roll instead of Nigiri.  The Flavor of the unagi was good but it was slightly burnt and crispy.  Not really how Unagi is supposed to be cooked.  For Nigiri I had the Salmon, Garlic Yellow Tail, Ikura, Unagi.  My biggest drawback to this spot was that it was extremely slow during 8pm (Peak Time) So I wouldnt reccomend coming here during this time.  I would assume 10pm might be better.  It would be less crowded and you wouldnt have to wait a long time for your food.  On average I waited 20 minutes between orders.  All in all they've got decent sushi here and good service however, it wont be my go to spot.",

First off, my friend ordered a roll without the rice and the waitress said that would be totally fine. They deliver the roll and it has rice in it so we told them we ordered it without rice and then the sushi chef said oh no we can't make that roll or any roll without rice....which I know isn't True because I've been to sushi places before where they just roll it in the seaweed. The waitress even explained it to him and he said it would be fine, but then told us he couldn't do it.   We waited an extremely long amount of time for our food, especially my bento box. By the time I got it, my friends had finished eating. The chef (same one that said he couldn't make the roll without rice) didn't know what went in the bento box apparently, and just didn't make it based upon the conversation I overheard with him and the waitress. I don't understand why he wouldn't have just asked what went in it instead of not making it at all.   The waitress was extremely nice and friendly, but was nowhere to be found most of the time. We had to get up and find someone to order more food and to ask for our check. She did give us a complimentary green tea ice cream for making us wait so long for my bento box, which was very nice of her.   There are so many sushi places in Vegas and Henderson that are a million times better than this place. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here.",

My two rolls were sauced excessively--a sure sign the resto is hiding the flavor and texture of the fish it sells. My unagi roll was very average. The rice in all the rolls & nigiri I ordered did not taste really fresh and firm as it should. The seaweed salad and miso soup were fine and should never be an issue.  I stopped in here b/c I was staying in the 'hood--it was close and convenient. If I'm back in the area and craving sushi, I will continue my search elsewhere. Oh, waitstaff was attentive and friendly--no issues here.",

    "text": "Sushi Way is on the higher end of average for AYCE sushi in Vegas- service was great and most fish was decently fresh, but the rice was oddly wet and dense, which significantly detracted from my enjoyment. From reading other reviews, I was expecting more riceless options here, and though they weren't clearly marked, the few I found were good.  APPS: the poke is decent with seaweed, ahi, and a lot of onion in a sweet-spicy sauce, BF really enjoyed the coconut shrimp tempura, the tartare was interesting, screaming orgasm was quite small compared to others' orders? NIGIRI: aside from the aforementioned rice issue, most fish seemed pretty fresh but some pieces were bland. Specials were pretty basic (fishy-tasting yellowtail with jalapeno, yuzu tobiko), salmon is my preferred fish but I didn't even request a second order because it didn't have much flavor... almost tasted like it had been frozen? ROLLS: This area of the menu seems to be their forte, the \"Sushi Nachos\" would probably be more appropriately placed in the apps category but was my favorite. Lisa hand roll could use a sauce to perk it up but was one of the healthier options. The DD and Candy Cane rolls recommended in other reviews were typical, the YOLO seemed unique and yet flavor was lacking and fried onions were old and hard.   I always recommend sitting at the bar, the chefs and server were super friendly. I don't know if it's their location or if they're just really popular, but they got crazy busy- recommend arriving early, as they were empty at 6PM and started a wait list around 7PM.",

So I put a search out to good old Yelp, and this place came up with good reviews and the price was right at $26 for AYCE dinner. I called up Sushi Way to see if I needed to make a reservation.. since it was a Friday night, but was told there was no need. Fantastic!  This place is right off the Las Vegas Strip (only about a 20 in walk from Planet Hollywood Hotel). So we were on our way!  Let me tell you, I was a little nervous for it being in a small strip mall, but do not let that deter you!!.. This place is amazing, with really fresh seafood.  The menu is the perfect size with lots of options for every taste preference. The best part is that they offer 1/2 rolls so you can try more options! I love this option, wish more places offered this!!  Don't know what you want... the staff is great at providing suggestions!  My faves of the night: the Big Easy, Volcano, DD, Green Monster,  Gyoza (pot stickers),  Jalapeno poppers, Bacon Scallop Skewers (so yummy!!)  As for the desert, only had space for a few spoonfuls of the Yuzu Sorbet, this was so refresing, wished I had saved more room to finish this.  So when in Vegas and wanting sushi at a reasonable price, this is the place to go!!",

The booths looks super nice and since the dividers are high it can give you a little bit of privacy from the other tables that you wouldn't get before so it's super great.  As always the food is super great and Jun is behind the sushi bar again after being a server for almost a month so it was great to have his sushi again ^^ 10/10 will always come back",

We started out with rolls (Sushi Solution, Chicago Fire, Rainbow Roll and I Love Sushi)...all delicious!  We topped it off with sides of Golbi, white fish with jalapenos, salmon ngiri..Before we could think of something else to get,  our server Jay just started bringing out extras for us to try including coconut shrimp, oyster shooters (interesting and not as horrible as I expected, although I didn't chew husband did and he thought it was great).   Albeit, there were no the guests,  but being that they are open till 2am, we went during the old people's hour and the place gets hopping later on in the night.

We tried a few rolls, the have the Sex Bomb, Crunch and Lasagna which are my favorites at Kaya. This is the same price as Kaya ($27) and I felt like it included more. I ordered the oysters which were dabbed with Siracha. They were so good! The rolls themselves were good but the part lacking is seriously customer service. We waited for water, to take our plates away.. There's no hostess here and the phones were ringing off the hook. I liked coming here but the customer service even made a party of 3 decide to leave after not being seated. Overall, I think I would come back.",

I recommend the white tuna topped with jalapeno and the Rock and Roll roll. The nigiri here is usually of excellent quality, though the last time I came in (my 4th or 5th visit) a few things felt like they were a little past their prime unfortunately.

The Sushi was some of the best we have ever had, certainly some of the freshest and by far the quickest and best service we have ever experienced.  We will most certainly be going back every time we are in Vegas.  This place ROCKS!!",

Make sure to specifically ask for it. The rest of my friends tried the AYCE.   I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento ($9). It comes with: chicken teriyaki, 4 California rolls, 2 gyozas, 4 pieces of vegetable tempura, a very small portion of potato salad, salad and miso soup. Although it was a good amount of food, nothing stood out to me.   One big thing that bothered us was the service. The busser was very friendly however our waitress...not so much. After my friend placed his first round of orders in, he called her back because he forgot to order some side dishes. She commented that \"you already ordered a lot.\" I understand that most places want to make sure you only order what you can eat but this was the wrong way of going about it. You can also only order 1 dessert item :(  I'm going to have to come back here and try the AYCE menu. Especially the coconut shrimp and sushi nachos, the two stand out items my friends mentioned.",

Aside from that is the style of the sushi bar itself. Dim with casual lighting. Very sensual and I really like the fact that they play rnb and 90's 2000's hi hop!!   Would recommend this place for any sushi eating fiend that enjoys a vast menu . I had very basic items, but my friends ordered a lot from their all you can eat side of the menu.

The quality of sushi is very fresh (better than hotels), and the price is perfect! The sushiman was great!! He recommend many amazing sushi we can try. He was friendly, making conversations while working diligently (perhaps because we sat at the bar top in front of him, but still hadn't had this kind of experience at other sushi restaurants!) The service they provided was phenomenal. I usually tip reasonably but I didn't mind tipping 20%+ for the overall experience. Whenever I visit Vegas again, this is definitely my go-to place.

The sushi place I usually go to as a variety of sauces for each type of fish and this place didn't really have that. Almost everything on the menu is all you can eat (including the desert:)). And if you want to get rolls you can always ask for a half roll (usually has a total of 4 instead of the usual 8 pieces) so you don't get full on just one roll. Other than that the service was awesome and were very attentive.",

But be patient.. the chefs are working overtime and the freshness is just as though the fish came out of the sea this morning! I'm not sure how they do it but coming from LA/OC, I'm serious when I say this place sets a new standard. Service is excellent and friendly!! We will definitely come back!! P.S. Kids 9 and under are 1/2 price. Here are the kids reviews - Chloe gave it a thousand stars and Lukey gave it a million hundred thousand stars...Chloe said if she was rich she would give them 1lb of gold for a tip! :)",

I usually go to Yama (I've been loyal to Yama for 11 years) but that place has seriously outgrown that spot (waiting for a seat at lunch at 2pm on a Monday ....just me....seriously?). As a result I decided to give SUSHI WAY a shot. It's only been open a couple weeks but I work nearby and fellow coworkers have said positive things....   I went by myself and tried a few things, not a single 'meh' it was all delicious! I went back again the other day and tried more rolls- I LOVE that they incorporate coconut into their tempura and rolls-YUM! I tried the bacon wrapped scallops -bite size and perfect. Coconut shrimp tempura-yum! Screaming orgasm-creamy and delish! Seared white tuna, garlic tuna- yum yum! Snow White roll-perfectly savory! And I tried 3 other half rolls (two had sexy in the name) but I don't remember the other (no matter what, you just can't go wrong).   The service was AWESOME, they didn't miss a beat. Food was on point. It's close to my work. I don't believe it gets any better.... Oh wait, it does! They have stamp cards for A.y.c.e.  Yes indeedy, I'm one happy lady!",
