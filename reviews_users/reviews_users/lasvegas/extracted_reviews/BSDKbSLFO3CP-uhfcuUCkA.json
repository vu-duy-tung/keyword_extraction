    "text": "....Where do I even start???!!!  SUPER LOUD!!  I get it, games everywhere, lots of people...  Not really a complaint, just didn't expect the sound to be so amplified.  It was like being in a club on the strip type loud.  Food was ok, but a long wait..like 45mins+.  Again, I get it, big venue, plenty people, no prob.  Our server, \"Yaya\", I didn't get her real name, was very nice.  But didn't pay us too much attention after we finally received our food.  Never received refills on our drinks and she pretty much didn't come back til we needed our check.  And wow, that took awhile too.  Like 20mins+.  Now here's the kicker...  I came in on 9/3.  My meal was only supposed to be like $24 and some change.  My gf and I only ordered two things, the Short Rib cheesy mac stack ($12.99) and the Original Bar Burgers ($11+) and water (free,lol).  Ran my card, didn't leave a tip on the check, but left a cash tip on the table.  Fast forward to 9/8, I go to check my account, like I do EVERY WEEK and notice I have a charge from Dave & Busters for $55.55!!  I call them immediately and finally get in touch with someone in the back, Brianna.  I tell her the situation, she tries to find my original transaction, but can't come up with anything.  Instead of me holding she tells me she will call me back when she comes up with something.  I get a call about 15 mins later and says she spoke with her management and they are just going to refund the entire amount!  Awesome, even though I told her that's not necessary, she proceeds to tell me \"they told me $55.55 was really nothing and would be more trouble trying to find the actual receipt and doing a partial refund, so they just said refund the whole ticket\".  Again, I wasn't looking for a whole refund, just wanted them to fix it, but hey whatever they say.  So she takes my card number and says it should take a MAX of 10 days to see the refund and if I didn't see anything by the tenth day (which would have been 9/18) to call back.  Cool, solved.  Fast forward, again, to TODAY 9/23, here I am doing my weekly check up on my account...  NO REFUND IN SIGHT!!!  I call them immediately...  To my surprise, the person I need to speak with picks up the phone.  NOT Brianna, but the Senior Manager, TJ.  I tell him the situation, never received my refund, blah blah..  Again, he can't find ANYTHING!  No record of my original receipt or my card info for the refund that Brianna wrote down and was supposed to submit.  He then says to me, \"I will take care of this, just need your card info\"..  UMMMMM, NO!!  WTF?!!  Now my damn card info is just floating around in your back room somewhere??!!  He says \"maam, there are a lot of papers back here everywhere, I'm sure its back here, but I just didn't want you to wait on hold\"..  UMMMMM, NO, AGAIN!!!  I told him \"THATS MY CARD INFO!!!\"  \"YOU NEED TO FIND IT!!\"  After a few minutes of fumbling around he finds my card info, IT WAS NEVER SENT OFF!!  And of course I have to wait another 10 damn days!!  Now, it will be over a MONTH til' I get my refund!!  TJ was nice, but I just feel like the management and staff are lacking professionalism.  I mean seriously, read the most recent reviews on this place, its pretty scary.  And no representative from the company or this branch has responded to any comments.  Servers short-changing checks, rude staff members, the list goes on and on.  Please be careful going here, I don't recommend it at all.  I definitely WON'T be returning.",

They could have been much nicer given that only one of us had an ID. It is inconvenient how Dave and busters does not except 18 year Olds yet have a huge arcade. We should be allowed to utilize the arcade at the least. It's not like we are going to get drunk at the bar or even be permitted to do so before being carded.It's ridiculous and embarrassing for the establishment to have hired individuals who lack manners and sincerity.",

Once we ordered we waited a long time for the food. I ordered a salad but my meal came out before the salad did. The waitress apologized and said sorry the kitchen is backed up. We started eating and I bit into something hard in my burger. It was a white piece of plastic in my food!  The manager was called over and he said this looks like the plastic clip that holds the burger buns, we will refund you for this meal and then walked away. No customer service skills whatsoever. The games are extremely expensive as well. Would not recommend this place. Game Works has much better customer service. Will not be visiting Dave and busters with my family again.",

First off when you first walk up to a table you as a customer are expected to get greeted ... Not with Sammie he walked up and stared at us expecting us to greet him apparently. I never just been stared at and had to start off the service. If it wasn't for the mangers and another server names Alexis we would of probably just got up and left at this point. Everything from the greeting to the drinks from the food and service was a horrible experience. Sammie defiantly needs more training , seems like we were the first he was the first table we waited on. Also I never felt so disrespected .. He never acknowledge me and only the guy I was with !!

    "text": "Dave & Buster's seems to be one of those places that is a HIT or MISS! I unfortunately got the MISS this past weekend. I was excited for Las Vegas to finally get a location because it was so annoying to see the commercials on TV for a place that didn't even exist in my city ugh!  My godson wanted to have himself a \"big boy\" party here so of course we made that happen! The staff.. Wow what can I say I just have to say that the employee's you hire for your business play such a crucial roll and will help make or break your establishment. The staff here have to be some of the worst I've ever encountered in terms of one of these \"Eat & Play\" kind of places. I'm from California and have been to that location several times, never experienced the poor service we got this weekend. When I arrived to the party it was after it started and of course it was a madhouse in here. I stood at the front for at least 7 minutes while two of the hostess girls talked with what looked like was either a friend or an employee. Do that on your own time darling you are working. What made matters even worst was the fact they both looked at me and just kept on talking.. Oh okay.. Finally somebody from off the floor asked me \"Are you here for a birthday party\" I replied with the name of my godson and she says with an attitude \"Which one there's 3 by that name and what's his age\" I just walked off and decided to find the party myself.  Fast forward to the party area. The food that is offered is sorry as ever. My best friend was so disappointed with the amount of money that was spent for such low quality food. We would've been better buying some food from the frozen food aisle at the store heating it up, putting it in some foil and distributing it ourselves! These pizza bite things were gross and the chicken fingers were dry, burgers were I hope burger's lol list goes on. Just a fail. The server that worked our party poor thing, she wasn't even the original one that was assigned. We had another one who mysteriously just disappeared. Not sure if she just got overwhelmed with our large party size but seemed a bit unprofessional to just bounce like that with no word! After we paid they pretty much kicked us out of the table and gave us one of those \"You don't gotta go home, but you gotta get the hell up outta here\" speeches. NO problem. As we were leaving, well attempting to leave there was a lockdown on the place because of a missing child. They have a procedure where nobody can leave when a child is missing. Interesting I'd like to understand this concept because it's odd.  All in all it was borderline terrible. The only thing that was good was my \"Tres Patron\" drink from the bar. The adults ordered alcoholic beverages and my mom got the watermelon margarita which was pretty awesome because the ice cubes were actually watermelons! It's odd here that you pay for the drink before you even get to taste it but that's whatever. Hopefully when I try this place out on a different occasion I can update my review and provide a much better experience.",

Weds are great as it's half price games and if you pay the upgrade on the eat and play package all non ticket games are unlimited . If they had this in the past they failed to mention it .

They had no problem arranging tables to seat 7 people. The waiter was super friendly and helpful. We went on a Wednesday night and got to enjoy their happy hour and half off their games. They changed the tv closest to our table to the hockey game we requested.  The food was amazing . Once it hit 7 , our waiter showed up few and far between, so the on point service kind of fell off.buts a good thing it was so great to start.   When you eat, you get to enjoy eat, play combos and there are a lot of cool games to enjoy, giant PAC man, giant connect four, there's a roller coaster game that blows air on you, price is right, monopoly, no deal, and plenty more and the tickets seem pretty reasonable. We made out with 3,000 tickets between 3 of us and only used what we had from the way and play combo loads.   I will say I had a coupon in my email for signing up for the rewards for $10 , and they said they don't do any coupons on Wednesday because everything's already discounted. The coupon doesn't say that and our waiter had said I could do it. It discussed that with the manager and he was excellent at accommodating us with gameplay but still couldn't honor our coupon.

Our server Carmen did mention before she sat us that they are shorthanded while also tending to a party room of 30 ppl. However, our server was very timely still being able to check on us and fill waters, remove plates. It was the kitchen that took forever with our meal. Me and my brother each ordered the unlimited wings, which btw you are not allowed to share with your party. Me and my brother weren't  even allowed to share and we ordered the same thing! Which is why i had to order my own.. i understand there are rules & thats how its run. Corporate happened to be there that night & even delivered one of our wings to us. While doing so he was staring down at our table, not even engaging with us. Just staring! Im assuming he was looking to see if we were sharing.. we sat right next to the kitchen so every time he would pass by... just looking at our plates. We felt uncomfortable & stared down... check pls! Although, our server Carmen was professional, friendly and provided the most excellent service... request her, she'll take care of you!",

Service is pretty garbage as well. No one seems to care about their work environment other than the fact that they are there to collect a paycheck.   All in all. Staff at the restaurant is horrible, food is horrible but the arcade side is awesome. Maybe it's time for some experience managers to come and train their staff.",

The only reason for the four stars is because every time we come no matter what day or time it's packed with kids and hard to get a decent amount of games in without spending hours. But that's not Dave and Busters fault. Would recommend for families on weekends  as  for a date night if you want more time without kids running or screaming around you try to go when they're all still in school early in the day or  like around 7-8 when they're going to bed .",

However, I do like their rule about 18+ to enter in without an adult since Roseville requires 21+.  I'm sad to see they are missing a lot of fun games like the miner derby game where you roll the ball into different color holes.  There's still room for improvement but the location is still new. I definitely recommend signing up for their newsletter and membership because they always send coupons like spend $20 and get $20 free.  Go on a Wednesday because it's half price games that day!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I usually come here for the games (which we love coming here for). This place is definitely known for their games with a large assortment to choose from. But this time.. we came yesterday to have lunch and wanted to play afterwards. The service started off rocky when we sat at the booth near the bar. It's basically \"seat yourself\" with menus at the table and the server is suppose to come and greet you. Only prob was that there was no server to be found. We waited about ten min (in an almost empty restaurant with only one group that was having their Christmas party and another group of four people at another table). After ten minutes of looking around for our server.. I wanted to leave but my boyfriend insisted to give them another try and sit at the bar counter this time. We practically moved a few feet from the booth to the counter.   As we were sitting down, we were immediately greeted by the bartender who asked for our drink orders. He saw we had an appetizer voucher and asked us if he would like to put in our order for the appetizer while we were looking at the menus. We ordered the nachos for the appetizer and two mojitos to start. Because we never really ordered food here (especially because there were specials on the menu if you order a dish with $20 play), the bartender helped us order and answered any questions we had. We decided to order from the specials- I ordered the mac & cheese & my boyfriend ordered the caveman (consisting of sliders, BBQ ribs, & fries) along with the $20 game play as well. The food came out hot and delicious.   We both were really impressed and happy with the service after having a rough start in the beginning. Our bartender came by to check in on us frequently. We'll definitely be back to try other food & drinks on the menu.. but one thing we agreed is to only sit at the bar if you want great service.",

The prizes are much nicer, it's easier to win more tickets, the greeters and cashiers were more exciting and welcoming, you get help right away if something was wrong with the machine, bathrooms are super clean. Like it much better than gameworks and much closer to home.   RESTAURANT:  FOOD was okay but to be fair, we only ordered appetizers   If you order the mini burgers and wings to share, it's basically the same as the kids meal menu. Little patties in tiny Hawaiian buns and little four pieces of chicken.  Same thing if you order the buffalo wings. Cute Tiny pieces that should be a kids meal menu.   Pineapple coconut snow cone was tasty but more like a slushie. Coronaritas were bomb.  SERVICE was bland at best. Mentioned it was our first time there, waitress really had nothing to offer or upsell to us. We've eaten everywhere in downtown summerlin and every person that waited on us were much more enthusiastic. So we were somewhat surprised at the lack of energy since it's grand opening week. It was busy on a Tuesday night but there were plenty of help from the look of it.  When we paid, we gave her a $100bill to break against a $70 charge, she gave change back in all singles and quickly walked away.  it would have been polite to mention if you ran out of change and maybe say have a great day.",

The drink I originally ordered was not what I ordered at all, I let the server know but due to how long it took to receive it I decided to just drink it, I didn't like it at all so literally took two sips and ended up ordering something different (was still charged for a drink I didn't even order or drink). Now it was time to pay, I was charged for the wrong amount and my friend that was with me was not only charged for the wrong amount ($72) but charged TWICE! We then had to get refunded (wait 3-5 business days to receive our wrong amounts). Not ONE SINGLE MANAGER came to talk with us until I hunted one down and he said oh yeah I already fixed it. REALLY THATS IT?? No apology?",

I liked her from the start because she was an obvious Steeler fan. Me and my friends had never been here before. She explained what they called eat and play combo. We all had the X-rated mojito which was fabulous.all in all we had an excellent experience. We never had to ask for anything because Stephanie was two steps ahead of us. If you ever want to go to Dave and busters ask for Stephany she's the Steeler fan LOL",

The games are fun, but can get pretty pricey. I really didn't care for the games that much, but it's great for bringing the whole family. The bar area is nice and wide open with huge screens everywhere. I've noticed that on the other reviews, people have been critical of the food. I actually thought the food was pretty good. I ended up getting the ribs and wings combo, and the portions were pretty generous. The ribs were tender, and the wings were decent in size. I kind of wish they would have setup the bar area with pool tables and dart boards so it gives you another option besides the games. All in all, Dave & Busters is a fun place to bring kids, but also a cool place to have a drink and catch a game.",

The smell got worse and worse, it literally smell like human feces. Yes, it smelled like poop. I called the waiter over an explained what it smelled like and i would like it taken off the bill. He did take it off the bill but reluctantly. The manager never came over to apologize nor did the waiter apologize. This is absolutely unexceptable in any restaurant if you ask me.

It's sad, as we have eaten here before ... but then again, EVERY TIME we eat here my stomach hurts the next day. This time was the icing on the cake. We won't be coming back and it's a shame we paid so much just to get sick.   Maybe a class on proper food handling should be given in the near future!! Save yourself , DO NOT EAT HERE.  Scratch that , we put 2 + 2 together and realized that we shared the \"mountain o nachos\" - which contained beef. And our daughter had the cheeseburger quesadilla , which also contained BEEF. Beware of this place. They need a visit from the health department, that's for sure.  Also, kind of funny how the \"reviews not recommended\" are all 1 Star reviews ... seems fishy as if it's being hidden to make this place look better!",

    "text": "This review is mainly for the bar/restaurant area...  I was so excited when I first found out that D&B was coming to Vegas. Locals used to be teased with the commercials on TV, when we didn't even have one here!  I never reviewed this place since my first visit because of the experiences I've had with the bar side. I've given this place so many chances to redeem themselves, but every time I come here, the same thing happens over and over. It's the main reason why I gave this joint a 3-star rating.  I understand if an eatery is busy and the staff may not always be on top of customer service, but even when it's slow? Eh... Whenever my group sits down at the open-seating area, we're always waiting. Always. Even if we sit right next to the bar, it's a waiting game.  The last time I came here to eat, I waited almost 20 minutes just to get drinks! Another 10 minutes to order food. However, the most recent visit here was much better. Our server and busser kept coming back to see if we needed anything else and how our food was. Their menu items are mostly bar-styled, but it's pretty good. No complaints there.  All in all, I don't expect much from a bar/restaurant that's connected to an arcade. I take into consideration the informality of the place, but improvements can be made. Playing the arcade games never fail though! They're just missing that horse/derby game that I see at every D&B. lol  Pro-Tips: -This place can get VERY busy on the weekends. Don't expect much when eating here on those days. You might be waiting for awhile. -Seating can be confusing. They have an open-seating area where you choose where to sit, and a secluded section where the staff leads you to a table.",

    "text": "Visiting Downtown Summerlin today and this wasn't my first choice for lunch as I wanted outdoor experience to enjoy the beautiful day in Vegas.  Unfortunately, my first choice, the dim sum restaurant is now out of business.  Didn't realize that I hadn't been in the area in such a long time.  So since its been years since we've been to a D&B, my husband made the final decision.  Going to D&B is scary for me because I know how much my husband loves his video games.  The menu has changed quite a bit over the years. Per our waiter, the menu was updated this past February.  Choosing an entree was a little difficult for me, do I go with the fish and chips that I've been craving for a couple of days now, that short rib mac and cheese sandwich looks amazing, but so does the CA turkey melt and the Crispy Nashville-style hot Chicken.   Normally, my husband has me order first, but because I was so undecided, I was very pleased when he got the Short Rib Mac and Cheese sandwich. Better yet, it comes with TOTS!  My husband did enjoy his sandwich. With the kick bite I got from it, the bread is so buttery and nicely toasted. The short ribs, nice and tasty and sweet and with the sweetness from the ribs on the mac and cheese, it was Oh so good!.  And tots, was alright.  As for my fish and chips, it was alright, but really oily. The chips, were nice and crunchy. The dipping sauce for the fish was a little too malty for me.  We received great service. And because it was Sunday and busy, our service was a little slow.  As for the location for the bathroom, we were directed to what I guess is the only facility, next to the huge Connect 4.  All in all, it was a typical experience. We most certainly will be back with family and to win a few prices.",

My sister and myself took our daughters who are 6 ice skating in downtown Summerlin, so after we decided go to D&B sit for dinner and let the kids play some games after! We sat down right away, but our server never came back so we had to go ahead and find our own menus, after about 15 minutes of waiting. Then manger I'm assuming came by took our order. The food runner and the waitress delivered it the food was low key nasty bar food , we ordered about 75$ worth of stuff I wasn't satisfied, but whatever that's expected I guess . Then we had to go up to the bar since no waitress ever came around to fix my daughters drink because they got it wrong. After we were ready to go we told someone please can we have our check after waiting and waiting no one ever came around with our check we got up!   The kids were so anxious so we decided  to go play and they could just come find us. Which they did and we gladly paid. What a mess! After we were done our girls were super thirsty so the same bar area where we ate we said let's run up and get some bottled water lmao that took a while we finally got someone and she said oh no kids here, there was a man standing right by us with his son. I totally get that but it's just water and we already we're not happy about earlier. She was so rude and nasty and said well you can sit and order it with a server, are you serious. I then proceeded to tell a manager he just said i can't hear you and didn't give a shit. She finally said I'll just comp it and handed us two bottles of water. Customer service is everything I'm so disappointed with what we experienced!",

The table next to us was cussing and yelling at the manager about how terrible the food was. So we got a bad vibe from the beginning. Then I ordered a traditional Mojito ($8)- literally sprite with a mint leaf. My fiance said something and since I had drank most of it they couldn't do anything. So I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio since you literally can't mess that up. Another person in our party ordered a drink the same as my fiance's and they came out in totally different cups, and another person got a jack and coke that was all jack and no coke. The waitress said it was her 2nd week and she was nice, but you could tell she didn't quite know what was going on. We had to ask other people for her to get our check after waiting for like 20 minutes. On top of all of this, I went to the bathroom and there was no toilet paper, one of the machines was out of napkins and it was overall just disgusting. We feel embarrassed for even suggesting this place. Please don't waste your time or money here.",

Best way to describe a Dave & Buster's....it's a Chuck E' Cheese for kids and adults.  I don't have little one anymore.  She's now an adult.  But when she was a child, she loved Dave & Busters.  Her competitive juices would flow, she would play games just for the tickets, and later hit up the gift shop.  I was that proud dad that would spend over $50 on games to win a $10 toy.  Yup, as long as my princess was happy, I was happy.   Times have change and I no longer find D&B as fun as it used to be. It's loud and this location's no different. This location is the smallest D&B that I have ever been to.  The games are newer and cost a grip to play.  Is it me or are the games that win tickets just getting harder and harder to win at?  As for the food, I haven't tried a lot here. The only items that I tried was their burger, the sliders, the fries, the ribs, the salmon, the wings, the chicken breast, the tenders, the onion rings, the onion strings, the pretzel dogs, the nachos, the pizza, and tots.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  I also had their calamari, the quesadilla, spinach dip, cheese sticks, NY steak, BBQ chicken, and mac & cheese.  Other than that, I really haven't tried much of their food.  The only item that really stands out is their ribs and BBQ chicken.  Now, those are pretty damn good.   I have also been here for a meeting.  Having a meeting here is pretty cool. D&B set us up in a private room with a few lunch options from the menu.  After the meeting, a D&B employee set us up on a scavenger hunt.  This was fun and I highly recommend.  D&B gave prizes and swag to the winners.  And by the way, my team won.    The last time I was here was with my girlfriend, our friend, and our friend's son. My girlfriend and friend played the giant sized Pac-Man, while I spent time with our friend's son playing video games.  He loved all the games, PR'd a few of them, and had a smile from ear to ear.  That's enough to put a smile on face too.  If he's a fan, then I'm a fan.  4 Stars!!!  2017 Yelp Review #22",

    "text": "This place is a clear 4 star+ for me, it's getting 5 stars because it far exceeded my expectations. It had been about 10 years since I had last been in a Dave and Buster's (in San Diego) and I can say without a doubt that the food is 100x better than what it use to be. We had the Philly steak sliders that came with fries and chicken tenders and the triple bacon burger. Everything was delicious; the bacon gouda sauce and the buffalo ranch that came with the sliders and tenders were both awesome! They had $3 Blue Moon drafts as a special so we had a bunch of those as well.   After eating we wandered over to the game area; we ended up getting a $29 playing card and added two $5 credits for the virtual reality Jurassic Park simulator. We played for over an hour and then did the simulator and still had about 1/3 of our credits on our players card that we saved for next time. Our favorite game was probably the two-player basketball connect four game :)  Overall I think that the food is great and the games are a good value. They also have a pretty good happy hour from the looks of it, late night too (9pm-12am) Sunday-Thursday.",

    "text": "This place is extremely busy!  Their seating is a bit confusing.  They have an area where you seat yourself,  and an actual dining room where you get seated and waited in by the staff.  My friend and I first came in and stood by the counter to see if we could get seated.  There were 4 women behind the counter and not one of them even glanced at us or attempted to notice us for a solid 5 minutes.  We finally decided to look for an open seat in the bar area and hope to get some service.  We were lucky to get some seats at the bar and was helped immediately by the bartender.  My friend had the Porterhouse burger and I, on recommendation from our nice bartender,  got the bacon burger.    The food is a bit pricy and their happy hour isn't really that good.  Their beer is $7 and for happy hour, it's $6.  Not much of a happy hour.  However,  we did enjoy the food and it was made to our liking.   We left the bar area and decided to play some games. It was both of our first time and we each got $25 worth of gameplay.  That  $25 lasted us 2 hours! We had a lot of fun playing the games.  You can keep the card and reload it on your next visit and keep the tickets to add up on it.  Keep in mind that it is very loud inside, between the people talking, the games, the music overhead. I have been home an hour and my ears are still ringing.",

After the damn worker at front counter took my $25 for the power card I purchase plus I tipped her $5 .. after which she mentions the special and made it out as if I can just pay $10 to get the deal..  Enter in my date arriving , sitting down and we got Phil as our server .. he's awesome if you're in there and here is too definitely seek him out .. he sat down next to me to explain the process and promos ... problem is what I was told at the front didn't work the way the First Lady explained .. now remember I'm a female on a date I am not looking to escalate or rock the boat but Phil did try to remedy and fix my issue by offering to seek a manager to adjust it but as I said .. I'm being taken out and trying to enjoy my company so I figured I'd save it for the review but I did advise Phil ( who was awesome about taking the feedback and offering to pass it forward ) that it really turned me off to the idea of eating food or sticking around . So what happened because the girl at the front made me feel scammed ?   When my date offered to add more money on the power up card , I was ready to leave .. they could of had a huge meal and drinks plus more money spent on games had full disclosure and proper training and team work been in place..  I hope next time I go they have it together and make sure their power card sales folks educate about the combos...  The games are fun especially the 3D game but.. yeah I can't speak to the food yet",

The front desk girls are always smiling as they give you your card to go play the games. Employees, like JD and Debra, who were holding the front door open, welcoming in each and every customer is the bonus added touch. They are so nice and courteous to their customers, by making sure they leave DB with a smile on their face and a good time!",

Their customer service is terrible and I don't think they care about customers' requests such as altering a machine to better the performance and the safety of other players. My friends and I often frequent arcades and there's only one other place in Vegas that is comparable and their customer service is SO much better than D&B's.   It's a shame since it was their grand opening and the managements couldn't care less about their customers. I probably won't be returning here until they improve on numerous things.",

    "text": "Lesson from this review: Terrible management on the game floor! 1 star cause I'm forced to give a star and the restaurant earned it. Why -4 stars?? I ALMOST twisted my ankle while playing a game because it was built badly. I told the manager to fix it and to prevent any more injuries, NICELY. The manager of amusement, Jose, said he can't fix the Pump It Up Prime machine because it is \"standard\" and built by \"professionals\". The ones in California are completely different and are SAFE to play on. My group of friends and I suggested to raise it so it is safer and giving the game a longer life span, instead of having people break it within a few months due to constant stomping cause it's too low. The manager refused to fix it and threaten us that he may remove the game and we could ruin it for all other players. He said EXACT \"If they don't want to play, other people can play, we don't need their money\" right in front of us. Well since they don't need MY money, maybe they will be okay without YOUR money too. I REALLY wanted to like Dave & Busters because it's closer to my place and because I love arcades. Maybe this is a sign to stick to Gameworks or Round 1 in Industry City to play video games. It was their first day opening to the public. The fact that management is willing to treat their customers with such little respect, shows they do not care about the company or customers who come in. Please avoid this, or go.. Since I already spoke to a manager and they are not willing to fix it, you can sue because the manager won't do anything about it even AFTER the issue was addressed.  The bar and restaurant were great though!! The waiter, Samuel, was attentive and got everything we needed. We had two managers check up on us and made sure everything was spectacular. *sigh* if only the game floor had the same customer service skills then this review would be a 5 Star. Since Dave & Busters isn't a go to play to eat, I wouldn't come back. Don't lean on the machines or they get mad and you must be over 18 to enter or be accompanied by someone over 25 AT ALL TIMES. No outside food or drinks even though it's not posted (not posted means they LEGALLY can't ban outside food/drinks), outside drinks including water bottles like arrowhead and Dasani. Guess they want you to get their FREE tap water?? I already spent $100 and I regret it.",

    "text": "1-star for the games 1-star for the great happy hour  I'm from California and I've been going to Dave and Buster ever since I can remember. Hearing that they were opening one in Vegas definitely got me very excited, so you could only imagine my disappointment. My boyfriend and I arrived around 830PM, a bit before happy hour so we could find parking and check the place out before the rest of our group arrived. The games are extremely fun! The variety is enormous, theres pretty much every type of game out there(just like I remembered)! My friend put his name down for a party of 12 and we were quoted 30 mins. I also work in food service so I understand that sometimes quote times aren't correct. But if you're under quoting by over an hour, then as a courtesy the hostesses should've let us know that it was longer than expected. Aside from that, our service was average throughout our meal. However, the quality of my entree was unacceptable. I ordered the tenderloin pasta with bacon wrapped shrimp. An $18 dish that tasted like it was only worth $5. It was also served to me less than room temperature. I understand that they were closer towards closing, but that doesn't justify them to serve cold dishes. Overall, if it wasn't for the fun games and atmosphere, this place would circle down the drain in no time.  PS: The bar is VERY busy. But it's expected, all the drinks we ordered were delicious EXCEPT the mango margarita. That was so bad I had to have it taken back and taken off my bill.",

After waiting 45 minutes for a table within 10 miutes of sitting 5 different people asked if we were seated by a waitress assuming we sat ourselves, yet nobody else was asked.  3. I inform our waiter that I have a food allergy and wanted to know if the appetizer we wanted had that particular food in it. He went to check and when he came back he told me they couldn't accomodate my my allergy due to cross contamination.... wait... huh? I tell him we want the appetizer anyway and I will order something different, he then walked away from the table without taking our order.   I think it's safe to say we will not be going to this D&B again.",

When she came back to get our orders she had only brought us 2 menus there was 6 of us at the table we asked her for more menus then processed to roll her eyes at us. Our food came to our table finally after a 20 minute wait  nobody liked there food, one of my friends his pasta he had ordered was cold  then proceed to talk to the manager.

Las Vegassss (in The Rock's voice)  During the first week of operations in their first store in Nevada, I went twice and was pleased with both experienced.   The games: the selection of games is similar to what you would expect in any major arcade. Basketball hoops, racing games, old school arcade games, just all that you would hope. There is about 100 total different games and the prices are fair. On Wednesday (half price games) me and my pops spent an hour and half there for $14 each. On Thursday for $12 I was there for about 1 hour.   Customer service: I was quite surprised with how many employees were here both days. I am not sure if this was just for the first week or if this is for the future, but since they were staffed very well the customer service was great.   It's a fun place and I am happy they are in my town.",

    "text": "Like other reviewers, I was excited to get a D&B in Vegas, having had countless fun nights out at the Honolulu location while in college and after.  Unfortunately, the experience for my wife and I at the Summerlin location was underwhelming at best. We sat at a booth by the bar to grab a quick bite and drink before going to a movie.  The Food: Decent. Back of the house has it together, but our \"loaded\" tots, which were supposed to be covered in cheese and bacon and sour cream had no sour cream, and cheese and bacon on about 7/50 tots. The tater cakes were ok, but the white dipping sauce was not ranch, as one might expect...it was horseradish sauce! It would've been nice to be told that before putting that stuff on the food :-/ Clearly, the waiter had no idea because when my wife asked for ranch, he said, \"Ok, I'll bring another one.\" The spinach dip was the best of the three items we ordered.  The Drinks: Surprisingly decent prices for a big beer and a Bloody Mary. Now, they just need to teach their wait staff about their drink options. This guy had clearly never heard of a mimosa, and when my wife asked if they could make her one, he said, \"If it's not on one of those [three separate] menus, then we don't have it.\" I saw the beer taps from our seat, two of the handles of which said \"Samuel Adams Seasonal\" and \"Joseph James Seasonal.\" I asked what the seasonals were and was told, \"Our seasonal is Sam Adams.\" After I left our table to ask the bartender, he gave me a sample, and I decided what I wanted. Unfortunately, the waiter ordered the wrong beer, and I had to go reorder from the bartender anyway.  The Service: Bad, with the exception of the bartender, who looked like Tyson Beckford with tattoo sleeves, ladies. Never have I signed a check, had the booklet between my arms as I finish my beer and converse with my guest, and had a waiter try to come back and grab the signed check from under my glass.  I probably won't come back. Maybe if I'm in the area, we'll sit at the bar to check out happy hour.  They have a lot of big screen TVs, so catching football could be cool, but these folks couldn't handle a slow day, so I can't imagine NFL game day.  This place has nothing but room for improvement.",

Well not the location in LV. It was cramped. It's the same size as a crummy C Cheese.   We finally got a table that seats 4 that they tried to cram 7 of us in. Not to good there. Two people had to stand at all times.   The games were fun but I think they need a better/wider selection of prizes. I've been to the Johns Incredible Pizza that opened up not to long ago and they have three times the seating and the pretty much have the same games but they also have rides.   Guess I'll save the 600+ points I still have for another time. I'll give them another go to see if it changes my 2 star review. If not I'll go to the Peter Piper Pizza they are building and give them a try. Otherwise it's back to Johns.",

It was a half price Wednesday, so it was busy. We waited in line to get our play card and use our coupon. The guy at the counter looked at me like I had two heads when i showed him the coupon on my phone. He took my phone from me and kept it behind the counter for the entire transaction, even when he was done with it, which I found odd. He also made sure to touch me with his creepily long fingernails as much as possible throughout our transaction, which was more often than you'd think.   He couldn't figure out how to use the coupon, he also couldn't figure out how to ask anyone for help.   Wednesdays are cheaper but also super busy, and we had to wait for most games we wanted to play.  Ordered a couple beers from the small bar on the game floor, and the bartender was unfriendly and kind of a douche, so that was fun.  I mean, this place is absolutely no better than gameworks.  Its also deafeningly, ear bleeding loud in there so its hard to carry on a conversation.  Uggggggh Dave and busters, you could have been so awesome, but right now you aren't even mediocre.

The two times I visited, the wait time was just horrible but my most recent experience had to be the worst I've ever experienced in my whole life.  This past Sunday when I went, a girl that served us took forever and I believe her name is Joanna. It took thirty minutes for her to bring out our first round of drinks(which was one beer tower). Throughout the whole time of her serving she had an unwelcoming vibe and attitude. And after much frustration, we closed our tab out with her and caught her trying to do us dirty. When she handed back our change, our receipt was no longer there with the incorrect change. So then we ask her for an itemized receipt to double check everything and what do you know, there was more change added to it and she claimed that she did the math incorrectly(Way to try and tip yourself).  I get it, you're frustrated and you think people are going to cut you short on tip but that's never okay. My friends around me were so fired up that they rambled on about how they didn't want to leave a tip... but I couldn't do it. At the end of the night I pulled her aside and tipped her an extra $20 and told her why we were frustrated and I hope she learns from this experience. I almost regret it because even after me trying to be understanding of her actions, she still tried to blame everything on the kitchen and the bar...Regardless of whether or not this is your first serving job, it still isn't okay to treat people like crap and this is coming from a fellow first time server herself.  Lesson learned: will just go straight to the bar",

We finished that and still had no drinks. Waited 10 more minutes (now 30 minutes since we ordered drinks).  I got up and walked over to the bar asking if there was a manager I could talk to.  After almost 10 minutes a manager came over and I showed him we had finished our food and still not received drinks.  Drinks came as we were speaking.  He apologized and I asked him about our other appetizer and for the game cards as the kids were getting a little restless waiting 40 minutes for their cards.  Our cards and food arrived within 10 minutes.  after the kids played for about 90 minutes still no one ever made eye contact to see if we ever needed a refill or additional orders.  I caught the eye of a server and asked for the bill which ended up taking 20 minutes to arrive.  I saw multiple customers asking to speak to managers.  The service here is awful.  No apology from the server.  Maybe it is ok if you are just sitting at the bar but the restaurant service was so bad. Tables were sitting covered in dishes from people that had left and new people having to sit at these tables for up to 30 mins waiting for them to be cleared.  We will not be going back.",

We got seated around 1AM, well aware that the place closed at 2AM we politely asked our waitress if it was still ok to order food. She was more than willing to take our order. We enjoyed our meal and finished eating right around 2AM. Once we finished closing our tab, another waiter walks by our table and ask us if we finished paying, we told him yes and his response to us was, \"well you guys can leave now, we're closed!\"  I understand that you guys had a long work day and are ready to go home, but there is a polite way to tell customers that they are closed and would like us to leave. A simple, \"just to let you guys know, we are closed and will be cleaning up\" would have sufficed.",

    "text": "First and foremost, I absolutely love Dave & Busters for its wide selection of games! However, what's truly lacking in this fairly new establishment is the lack of quality customer service. I understand that it's only been open since Monday, but for the sake of this franchise, I hope that this particular location will learn how to adapt and treat customers as they want to be treated in the near future.   This 2 star review is specifically targeted to the dine in restaurant located within the establishment.   At 9:15pm (Wednesday 8/10/16) my group had put our name down and was quoted 30 minutes to be seated. Although this seemed to good to be True, we took the hostess' word for it, only to not be seated for another hour later. Our server \"Daisy\" took care of our party smoothly for the most part, but we were turned off by the offensive remark that she had made regarding 3 of my Asian friends at the table. When returning our IDs to the table, she had stated that she couldn't tell the difference between them even though these 3 individuals remotely do not look the same at all!   The treatment that we had received towards the end of our meal and closing takes the cake. A tall gentleman who we had never seen before in a headset approaches us and I quote tells us, \"Hey everyone, I know you're having a good time and all, but we need you all to leave because we are closing.\" When the gentleman approached us, we were still waiting on our credit cards and finishing up the rest of our drinks. Excuse me? This isn't common courtesy at all... This is not how you treat paying customers who are trying to enjoy your restaurant.   Thanks Dave & Busters for the games, but please learn to get it together at the restaurant part and learn how to treat customers nicely and with respect.",

    "text": "Sometimes, it's easy to tell the merits of a place when you deal with their management and see how well they deal with simple requests, to make their machines more enjoyable for both casual customers and potential repeat visitors.  This D&B, all things considered, has not quite lived up to this.  At other arcades (whose names I won't mention...), if we tell management that there is an issue on a machine that could potentially cause injury, they send out a technician to assess the problem. Here, even a request like raising pads on a dance machine-- an easy adjustment that can be done without having to restart said machine, something that would enable players to more easily play without the risk of tripping on the metal-- was met with stiff opposition and excuses left & right.   I don't know if the management of this Dave & Buster's reads these reviews, but please look after your machines better. An insanely loyal and surprisingly affluent group of people who are willing to sink money into your machines even on quiet days have waited for this place to open, with expectations other arcades in Las Vegas have set. It's disappointing that, on the opening day, this location misses the mark.",

There was a line at several of the more interesting and popular games, and im not a fan of lines. It was noisy, a little overcrowded, and had lots of kiddos running around which isnt great if you are carrying a beer.  Overall a fun date night, but we wont be back on a weekend night due to the overcrowding.",

Had the caveman special and the chicken queso appetizer.  Appetizer came out after i was done with my actual dinner. Ughhh. Took forever to get water refills.  It was super loud even in the restaurant side. You can hear everything from the arcade side. They should have had a better layout planned like keeping the restaurant further away from the bar and arcade like every other DnB I've been to.  Arcade side is small. It concentrates more on carnival things more than actlual arcade. There are no fighting games but a lot of carnival games and games i have on my phone.",

I've been to other D&Bs and Gameworks and I have always gotten great service at this one, especially in comparison to others.   Bartenders and servers are great. Sometimes the service bar can take a minute, but as a previous bartender, I also know what it's like to be in their shoes and they do pretty damn well for how busy they can get. They are always really cool and do cater to their customers.   I like coming here with my friends, coworkers, and just have a good time. They keep it pretty clean, the food is good for bar food and is pretty competitive with like a BWW.   Yes, there's a ton of kids but also a lot of adult fun. There aren't a ridiculous amount of games but there are a lot. I enjoy coming here on date night, for happy hours, or just at random cause I'm at DT summerlin. It's one of the best D&B's service and food wise that I've been to between here and Southern California.",

Then waitress proceeded to tell us that she is going to look for our server but at the same time took our drink order . Finally the drinks came 15 min at which at that time I asked for the WiFi code as my phone has poor service in DB the server or our server said yeah we got it but don't know the password I'll be back. With that being said he never came back to tell me I had to get up and get it. When he did come back he was like I haven't figured it out yet. The food is okay nothing to write home about. I think that they do need either more servers or something because everything we ordered took forever to come out even my refill on water !! As my friend said it's like a truck stop dinner",

The best part about this place is that you can drink inside and they let you bring your cup around to the different games.  It can seem a little small and cramped inside, but they have a huge variety of different selection of games from Mario Kart, to life sized gummy boxing things, to almost regular sized basketball shooting machines.   Don't forget to sign up for their email newsletter if you come here regularly because they give awesome deals if you already have one of those game cards. Sometimes they double the value of how much you pay for, like give you a free $20 worth of gaming which is awesome!!!!!",

    "text": "Came to Dave & Buster's for my niece and nephew's family birthday dinner/fun. I was very disappointed. We are a party of 9, 4 of which were kids. We sat in the restaurant section and ordered drinks and appetizers. Then we didn't see our waiter for a long while. When he returned, we ordered and then we didn't see him again until the appetizers came out. He seemed like he had a lot of tables and not a lot of help.   Most of the food came out but my sister waited an extra 10 minutes for sliders. My dad ordered a burger well done. It came out medium. He asked for it to be taken back and made well done. We waited 20 minutes and the manager came out only to say it would \"take a while\" for his food because he wanted his burger well done. We waited another 10 mins and when the burger came out the second time it was still pink. The manager came around and my dad told him this was the second burger and it wasn't cooked properly. He apologized and took it off our bill. Nice, but at this point we were 2 1/2 hours into our dining experience and we just wanted to be out of there. My dad left hungry. We had twins celebrating their birthday and after waiting another 25 minutes, our waiter brought out their birthday dessert. He set them down, lit the candles, and left. Super festive. After another 15 minutes we were brought the bill.   All in, we were at the table for 3 hours. My mom had 1 iced tea because every time we needed something we had to literally flag down someone to help us. I don't know what the issue was but half the time I could see groups of 3 to 4 people standing either inside the kitchen doors or at the waiter's ordering stations just chatting. None of them came over to refill our drinks or clear plates. I saw 3 managers floating between the gaming room and the food area, not one of them came to our table until there was an issue that needed resolved. Very poor customer service and a sad 5th birthday celebration.",

    "text": "Great selection of games, alcoholic beverages and food. Unfortunately it does have its flaws and needs to be adapted to Las Vegas.   When I lived in the East Coast, this was our playground. When I heard about them coming to Vegas, specially near me, in the Summerlin area, I have to admit I was ecstatic!   Everything about Dave & Busters is great, since I can't eat out due to them not catering to my dietary restrictions, I won't be reviewing their food.   Unfortunately in their limited space, they chose to instead of amping up the actual games that people play, with Carnival games, such as the coin tossing games and etc... and limited the amount of competition based games people come here to play such as the Racing, Shooting and Fighting games.   Drinks are nothing out of the ordinary and a tad overpriced, but it's what you'd expect from a chain.   Bullet Points   * 4D Terror Machine has a HUUUUUGE line everytime, I once waited over 45 minutes in line and didn't get to play. They should honestly get 2 in there, get rid of the Luigi Mansion one and add another 4D Terror booth.   *There is an airplane shooting game that is incredible, it was tricky to find where to open the door that lets you inside of the booth, but it's one of the best immersive games there  *There is a horse racing area in the back. You breed your horse and train it and race it, in the end you can print out your unique Horse ID Card which you can keep with you so you can always come back and race with your saved horse.   *Skip the \"Rollercoaster Experience\" crap where you lay down on a seat that vibrates. It is extremely pathetic, the volume is low, the graphics are outdated and it's not a bit thrilling.... it is a vibrating chair with a video of a weird rollercoaster ride. You will NOT feel remotely close to being on an adventure ride.   * They need to get a Mortal Kombat game in there... REALLY.   * Needs to be open later ...this is Las Vegas, not some small town in Mississippi. For it to close at 12 AM on Thursdays and Sundays is ludicrous!  We start Pre Gaming at 11 here in Vegas ...   All in all, it's a fun place to go, it does have its flaws and does seem that the negative comments are more linked to the dining area. I do hope they plan on improving to make this an even better experience.",

She spoke to me like I was an incompetent idiot, when trying to use my coupon. And being that she was the first employee we encountered when we walked in she easily could have ruined our whole night and impression of the place.  However, all the other employees were very friendly and helpful.   The games are reasonably priced, and the prizes are reasonably priced for the tickets you earn.   We ate dinner here as well, the food was okay nothing to write home about except the chocolate fondue we had was delicious! And our waitress was very attentive and friendly!

Tables seated after us received their food before us. My daughter's chocolate milkshake took 15 minutes to arrive and our appetizer arrived with our entrees (this really gets me) after 35 minutes.   Also we were never offered any drink refills. Our server was pleasant, just not attentive. Never communicated any delays except to tell us they had to go get some ice cream for the shake.   Our family had fun playing games after dinner though. The 4 way air hockey was a blast. We'll go back for the games, but probably not for the restaurant. By the way, this was at 4 pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was not busy.",

The staff and management turnover since they opened is horrendous.  I only recognize one person from when they opened. And he is a busboy who rocks.  This means very little teamwork or camaraderie at all. With a lack of leadership, also this place is in so much  need of.     It takes forever to get initial service and even longer for any form of continued service. We had to stack our 8 empty water and beer glasses on the table just to get some service.  I always sit in the bar area because I am not a gamer and just want to watch the fights with some food and beers. But for some reason the bar is filled with unattended running children. You would think that with a dining room as large as it is that kids would not be allowed in the bar area.  It's like a fricken Chucky Cheese in there's when it gets busy.  One manager did comp us two beers because of the dreadful service. Which I appreciate. But it should never had come down to that.  The servers do not have large sections. And they have bussers and runners who do most of the work.  If the servers would stay on the floor and in there sections. That's all I really ask for.  All in all, just another disappointing night at D n B's.",

Coming here and spending an outrageous amount of money on food and a drink is not going to work. After that I'll spend another fortune on a card and credits to play games. It's cheaper to go to a casino where I'll get a free drink every half hour when I play games (slots & tables) for nearly the same price and have the opportunity to actually win something useful....money. If you want to gain business you need to focus on competing with the businesses that are taking our customers. I'd rather play skeeball or air hockey then sit and watch reels spin but for my money, I'm better off in a casino. If I were you I'd try to focus on drawing in locals with discounts and deals. Dave & Busters isn't a special entertainment destination to those that live in town, throw us a bone and help us help you! #localsdeservemore",

I wouldn't come back simply because of that. Not good.",

Me and my friends got here at 9:30, didnt even get approached to order drinks for 40 minuets after sitting down. Once we ordered we waited another 30 to receive our drinks. Over all we didnt get a second drink until 11:15 which left us no time to play games because it closes at 12. Not only did they lose our money in game play but also in tips.",

I acclimated in about ten minutes I looked at then menus and I was pleasantly pleased with my choices.  I enjoyed the appetizer which was a nice size portion, it was there quite quickly. I actually had to push it away or I would not have been able to enjoy the rest when it came.  Then came the salad and the chicken noddle dish the steak was very tuff but the salad was tasty.  The chicken was definitely banging so much flavor and the Thai noodles were amazing you couldn't get enough of them.  My granddaughters pretzel dogs were beef dogs a they were really wrapped in very flavorful pretzel bread that were made perfect. I recommend these dishes and I will give the steak salad another try next time.",

This one definitely is the same formula....BUT  The biggest difference I've noticed is how new this space is. It opened up in August of 2016 so everything is super clean and it really is fun to go to while in Downtown Summerlin.   Service is mediocre as many of the people seem like they don't enjoy their job and it kinda kills the fun vibe.   Food isn't amazing just enough of quality to fill you up.   Games are pretty cool def haven't seen some of these and almost every game is multiplayer which is really fun.",

Let me specify something though that I feel is necessary, their bar staff... good God, if you don't experience anything of value in your life whether that be skydiving, climbing Mt. Everest, WHATEVER it may be... visit this place simply for the service from their bar staff! The two ladies we had tuesday night were not only wildly entertaining, but as attentive as can be without officially stepping the boundary of overbearing. It was perfect. Suggestive on items, thoughtful on preference, and for a place that had such a great selection I found that extremely valuable.   Please keep those bartenders with all your might and I will regularly frequent. Otherwise I might consider boycotting as if a victim of Stockholm syndrome. They were that good.   Games are fun too though. Check it out!",

If you think it's expensive, go to Disneyland. If you want to drink yourself into a coma, go to a bar.   Every time we come here, they greet us with a smile and open the door for us. JD walked us through the place and created our Power Card. He told us about promotions and specials. Employees like JD are the reason why this place will succeed.   We went to eat and Marco was our server. He was professional and attentive. The food is good and the ambience is great. It's also very clean. I understand it's not fine dining but if other Yelpers want to cry about the food, there are a dozen other places in the area. Another reviewer said the place was too loud? Are you retarded? It's an arcade. Go to the library if you want peace and quiet.   I highly recommend Dave & Buster's to anyone who wants to have fun and eat good food.",

I was nostalgic for the Cajun Shrimp Pasta, so I decided to take my kids to the new Summerlin location last night. From the get go, the whole staff was chipper and bubbly, even under so much noise and so many people! We got to our table and Bill was our server, he's from back home in SoCal, so right away we clicked with him. I was disappointed to see that my favorite pasta was no longer on the menu. To my surprise the Chefs went above and beyond and made my dish. Thank you for a wonderful evening! My kids even remembered Bill's name, he was very nice to them, that goes a long way with me!!! Being in this industry and always going that extra mile for my guests, it was a wonderful experience and a great gesture by the staff to make a special entree just for me. We've already planned our next visit.",

We left. (Mind you the side that was closing had people sitting there. We also purposely say next to seated tables to make service easier and more convenient.)

Maybe get rid of some of them and hire more people like Garrett.)",

So we bought cocktails and got on the waiting list for a table for dinner. Waited about an hour btw.. So we then proceed to the front and ask about the place since no one greeted us at the door and told us anything about the place. There was 4 of us adults and we were under the impression this was a fun place for ADULTS! Uh yeah NO. There were little kids running around and screaming everywhere like we were at one of those children pizza places and a bunch of teens being loud and obnoxious.  In the restaurant area we ordered a full rack of ribs, the calamari and totts with bacon and other toppings. The RIBS WERE AWFUL and overcooked! THAT CALAMARI WAS THE WORSE I've ever had, dry and overcooked and hardly any on the plate, they substituted some of the calamari rings with banana pepper rings. Just awful!  My friends ordered the philly sandwich and a Salad (I think the lawnmower) which was ok. We treated our friends and it was a waste of our money! Geez!  Ok now those games. Wow, what a selection......its way smaller there then I had imagined. Kids were bumping and running into us, we couldn't even play a game without a line of people behind us or someone bumping us. This place is just down right awful!  It blows that I still have a lot of \"chips\" on my card because we only played 3 games! But I will give it to some kid to use because no one in my party enjoyed this place and we will not return! Do not waste your time or money here if you're looking for good food or an adult night out!",

My 10 year old son was treated rudely by a terrible costumer on the arcade floor (when he tried to kindly show the a nasty woman where the card comes out of the machine she said to the man with her: \"The kid thinks he can get my card.\"  I told my son that was rude and he shouldn't be quiet about such behavior. She pretended not to hear me. Then she took her time and played at least 5 more rounds. I have patience and we waited. My son played one round and then she came back with the man accompanying her. Pushed me away and said she wanted to play with my kid. That's creepy. I said he doesn't want to play with you, since you were rude to him.  Then she said: that's sexist! When someone doesn't know what sexist means, it's embarrassing. For them.  Then I said please allow him to play, since he waited for you to play several rounds. And I told her when you don't know when and where to use the term \"sexist\" don't use it. Then she said: \"Says the big fat lady.\" My son was so upset at the point and I went to the manager and told her she needs to deal with this much insult. The management did nothing to help.  She offered free points to my son. That's not how I deal with problems, and that's not how I want to teach the right behavior to my kid. I said no, and insisted on her taking care of the mess. She said I'll go talk to them. She didn't. She want intimidated or didn't want to or whatever her deal was. She stood next to me and tried to apologize for them! So she wouldn't have to go talk to nasty woman and the man accompanying her. I took out my phone to look up Dave and Buster's phone or anything on their website to file a complaint. I didn't have my glasses on and had to hold the phone farther. The man with her started taking pictures of me! I wasn't even facing them. I told her I don't want my pictures in his phone. She talked to him. He said I did it first. The manager believed him! Just beautiful! The Metro officers on the floor where useless. They told me this is the company's private property and they can't do anything! The manager said go to the other side of the floor so you don't see them! Seriously?!   Here is the great ending; I asked her if I'm not white enough to be treated equally and fairly. The she asked us to leave. The Metro officers said I had to leave since the manager asked me to. The entire time the sick nasty woman was playing and laughing at me and my son.  I won't let this go. That manager needs to see the consequences of such poor decisions.  If you have similar experiences please share.",

They said it was reserved but then another person said oh you have to wait 5 mins until we clean a table. Like which one is it. It's 4 females standing there at the booth but I have to speak to you first. Moving on I go to the open seating area and we wait and nobody comes over. It was like 10 ppl in the counter chillin and one had to be a mgr cause he had an ear piece. I go get someone and he is acting shocked nobody comes over and he said oh I'll go get y'all some water and he never comes back. . Anyway later on my daughter tries to come in and they wouldn't let her. Like help me understand why ppl are guarding the door and teens can't come in by themselves but they can walk throughout the game area by themselves or even the open seating area which is right next to the bar area.

We had a had  time trying to figure out the whole coin buying thing and when we went back around to ask the girls at the front they just told us there was machines in the back and to buy them there. OKAY. After that we pretty good time and got a good amount of tickets, but not enough for what my baby sister wanted, we were just about 50 short so I asked the girl at the ticket stand if we could buy tickets, pretty sure her name was Arielle and she just looked at us like we were stupid and rolled her eyes.

The bar was pretty packed but most of the bartenders didn't seem to have any urgency, probably took at least 10 to 15 mins to order with them.  Our server at our table, Rebecca, was by far worse than the bartenders though.  She appeared to write down our order but then came back 5 mins later asking us about our orders again.  Every time she came to the table she had some excuse as to why something took so long or wasn't right and always had someone else to blame.  I hate when servers complain all the time.  Before our food came we ordered a blue moon, Rebecca told us she would get it after she got all the other drinks she needed to get for other customers, as if we were being a nuisance.  We got our food which was luke warm so probably had been ready for a while, then had to request silverware from another server.  Still waiting on a beer.  Ate all our food, still waiting on our beer.  Cleaned up our plates, still waiting on our beer.  Eventually Rebecca came up to our table and placed the receipt on the edge without asking if we needed anything else and said \"oh did you still want that blue moon\"  we told her no and she said \"I didn't think so\" and walked away.   Rebecca is not meant to work in the service industry.  Was a little dissapointed later on in the night that when we went to the bar at 1:30 am the bartender told us that they had already called last call when you close at 2.",

The food was delicious, especially the Mountain O' Nachos, and the drinks were affordable. I think the tower of beer was like $30, and shots of Crown were $7.99. Not bad for being out in Vegas. So many fun game choices that my kids loved, and the ticket center has really cool stuff for them! Much better than the options at places like Chuck E Cheese. A great time for kids and adults.",

It isn't too packed whenever I visit, but I tend to avoid peak hours. Drinks in here are a little expensive but they're good. Good luck waving down a bartender when it's busy. It is harder than some of these video games!  The food is alright, but who really goes to Dave and Busters to eat? Well, this is Yelp which relates to food so unfortunately I have to factor that into my star count....  Games are a blast. I wish there was more selection. They let you bring the drinks to the games as well. Make sure you sign up for their email list. Yes, you will get annoying emails, but it's great value if you actually want to come here and play some games because it's basically $40 for $20! 2 for 1! Sweet deal",

My parents would play on your tables, poker, blackjack, etc. We (me & my sister) would of course be in the arcade spending quarters like mad. This was way back in the 80's. You grew from there, my parents would spread the word to all our friends & their friends and it kept going. Soon your company was the biggest hit ever in Dallas then all over the place throughout the years.   Today, I am still a Dave & Buster fan and always will be. But your location here in Summerlin/vegas as much as we still go there and like it, you need seriously be careful on who you hire. some of your employees really can be god awful. I get the fact maybe they're having a bad day, week, or whatever. But they really shouldn't take it out on their customers or let it affect their job performance. I get most are young, they're learning the ropes, but hey, freakn teach them. making customers wait for long periods of time for just to be served is bad enough, and then never really checking in on them especially after they're done with their meals and been waiting for a long time just to receive the check, I mean come on. The bartenders, I heard and saw for myself how everything was nothing obligation or them, you can see the tension in their face while serving customers. I heard & saw arguments as the customers said the hell with this and just got up and left, didn't even touch what they ordered they were so fed up.   Dave & Buster's is a good place, don't let it slip downhill. So far we've been there at least a dozen times now, and it's been half & half. I want to give you 5 stars, but I can't. teach your staff to at least be happy toward customers if not better. That's my 2 cents. Peace.",

We were there until about 1:30am and started the night off with some food and bev. Sadly, we found ourselves seated and waiting to order for a solid 15 min. We were seated on the outskirts of the bar area so it was challenging to flag down or even see waitstaff... We finally got up and found someone to help.   Skyler came over and made sure that we had everything we needed from there on in. He was super-friendly and apologetic for the first impression and we appreciated that he didn't just hand over the responsibility to someone else. He even bussed the table for us and followed up regularly to make sure we were doing okay. The extra effort and attentiveness really made all the difference in the world.   The food was good, despite the other reviews I read. Granted we just had an assortment of apps, the ribs we super yummy and I must go back for more!! Sweet with a nice kick.   Over-all it was a fun night, the drinks were sooo good! Every time we went up to the bar for more, all of the bartenders were just as happy and enthusiastic to help.   We'll be back!!",

    "text": "So the game selection is awesome, but it's clear that the staff is all brand new. We tried a huge portion of the cocktail list and nothing on it was good. The food was okay? Not good. The staff was nice, but we had to wait two hours before anything was bussed (3+ for the unattended tables around us). Our server was nice, but we had multiple issues including her telling us that the manager was not allowing us to take the \"sea monster\" figures in the tiki drinks despite it saying that these were included on the website AND the menu.  Also, 10 minutes before closing there was a \"last call\" for games and despite the fact that some games (that you paid for as a patron) lasted more than ten minutes there were police officers and staff that stood behind you with folded arms (do they pay you extra for that?)  Anyway, I'd take Gamework's customer service and drink selection over Dave and Buster's any day. Unfortunately I still have credits on my Dave and Buster's card... Does any one want it? Selling for cheap.",

Manager came over and offered me a free spinach dip. WHAT??!   My time is worth a whole spinach dip. The staff that took our order was good.   The place was understaffed as stated by wait staff that they had seen we were not being tended to. The management team needs better training. They seem a bit unprepared to deal with conflict. Very unseasoned. Not their fault at all. There is always a guy at the top who needs to train them better.   The food was very good. The serving staff was good. Albeit the manager did the best she could under the circumstances. If it was my joint. Get people in and served quickly so they have time to enjoy the gaming experience also. What should have been a 30 or 40 minute dining experience turned in to 1 and a half almost 2 hour dining experience. Think of how much more people could have dined instead of me and my family being tied to a table for almost two hours.   Room for a lot of improvement.",

    "text": "Went here at the request of my son for his birthday. My youngest son has been dying to go to this since it opened. So, when his birthday rolled around, we decided we'd go. We purposely went in the middle of a Monday afternoon to avoid crowds.   This place is so overpriced for what you're actually getting. The food was awful. I got a burger that was shaped in a perfect circle, indicating it was simply a frozen patty that was heated up. It was the most bland burger I've ever had. The fries weren't bad. My husband and one of my sons had the Philly cheese steak sandwiches. They complained the cheese sauce was super salty. They would have preferred real cheese. My husband said it wasn't terrible but way overpriced for what it was. My daughter had chicken fingers and again, she said they were ok but not worth the price. The prices are steep for what amounts to bowling alley food.   The games are fun but the cards are pricey and you have to spend a lot to earn a substantial amount of tickets that earn you cheap crap. Everything in the store could be purchased somewhere else for much less. My kids each got $20 gaming cards and racked up some tickets. One of my kids spent all their tickets on an umbrella hat and some candy. So, $20 for an umbrella hat and candy. I can buy an umbrella hat for $5 on Amazon and the candy for like a $2 tops. So, we spent $20 for $7 worth of junk. You could argue there is value in the fun that was had from playing the games. But there are several arcades around the valley that offer that kind of entertainment for a much better price.   My son is happy that he got to check it out. It was fine one time. But I seriously do not see us returning.  I gave two stars because the staff was very friendly and our waitress was awesome.",

We arrived right when they opened - 11:00 a.m. - and immediately sat down in the dining room for a bite to eat.  The menu has so much to take in...  we decided to order a few dishes and share everything.  We had the Mediterranean Hummus with veggies, Tomato Feta Soup, and the Pepperoni Pizza Pull-Apart Bread...  amazing choices and there is so much more we want to try.  After lunch, we played a few games...  ended up staying over an hour just checking out everything.  The \"redeem shop\" has some really cool items that I look forward to hopefully getting the next time I am there.  So much fun for a Saturday...  go check it out!",

We sat ourselves at a table around 9 and there were plenty of waiters/waitresses just all huddled up by the bar area not really doing much. About 20-30 minutes we tried waving a waiter/waitress down to help us but none of them would. It's funny cause a few girls looked right at us while we were waving at them but then they just turned away lol. But then Shaun finally came to help us out (thank god cause we loved having him as our waiter, he's the best!). Shaun wasn't even assigned to help our table out but since no one else would help he decided too. The orders came out fast and he was very fast with refills as well. He also gave us a free dessert! So 5 stars for Shaun and 4 stars for the restaurant lol",

I was very disappointed when I got there at 9:30 because as soon as I  walked in I immediately saw little kids and teenagers!!! Kids running around unsupervised and teenagers  nothing but into  their phones in the way and in the way where the adults couldn't play games.  I only got to enjoy 1 drink which was the TNT and wasn't strong and comes in a really small glass.  They don't have the prices on none of their drinks or food. Strange that a restaurant wouldn't have prices so you'll know before ordering.   I've always thought they kicked you out if you weren't over 21. Even though it's the only one in Vegas, I probably won't be retuning because kids & teenagers everywhere are a deal breaker for me.  I was very annoyed and couldn't enjoy myself. If I wanted to be around kids and teenagers I would have went to Chuck E Cheese or John's Incredible Pizza. Ugh what a waste of time and gas.",

She was awesome!   The games were expensive, yes, but that is to be expected. It was worth the money to get some fun, vibrant, LED games. We had a blast!   The 3 stars it is lacking comes with the restaurant hostess staff, the game redemption staff and the food. We had never been there before and I had my underage daughter with me. We walk up to the front of the restaurant, 3 feet from them, and they act like they don't see us. But we're making eye contact. No one speaks. Finally, I speak up forcing them to address me. I simply wanted to know \"Where can I sit with her to eat?\"  I was told \"anywhere\". Um, okay. Wow.   We sit to in the restaurant to eat some food. The menus make the food look awesome.....it's a lie. The food was close to inedible. I didn't complain, because I was afraid they would bring me more disgusting food. I had the burger. It tasted like bad meat and was very fishy. The cheese was burnt too. It was horrible. My stomach turned trying to eat it. The fries were okay. Some kind of seasoning makes them weird too. I ask for ranch. That's safe, right? Wrong. Even the ranch tastes like rosemary or something strange in it. Yuck.   My daughter had the little pretzel dogs. Basically, pigs in a blanket. The wieners tasted and looked like beef jerky and the crescent rolls seemed raw. I didn't say anything to her about my food. She says \"Mommy, this is gross.\" So there you have it.   Fast forward to after we ate and played games. The two very young girls running the prize area were very nice but just need some training on what to talk about and not talk about in front of customers. I'm not a prude, I could care less. I just imagine some people might not like the awkwardness. I walked up with my daughter and the girl says very loudly to me \"Yeah, this day is going to totally SUCK.\"  Lovely. She was nice just needs to chill with that to customers.   All in all, I would go back for some games, maybe. But eat before you go and don't go if you don't want the loudest experience of your life next to a concert.",

So I was left standing and she looks at me and says you can go to the kiosk, I said will it take my coupon in my email, she says no, and continues to do whatever it is that she is so consumed by on the register. Then she in a very loud and obnoxious voice\"hello\" and I just went up did the transaction, I never said a word!!! I tried to be calm because I was with my children. She was rude as hell!!!! So I went an found the manager and let him know that I did not appreciated this employee being such a jerk for no reason!!!

Some drinks took over 20 minutes to receive after ordering because they were simply forgotten... food orders were being forgotten, some orders given to the wrong people. I honestly don't ever remember one timer where a server came by to check on anyone or to ask how things were. No one at our table ever got a refill of any drink.... once everyone was finished eating it took about 30-40 minutes to get all the tabs paid because so many things were incorrect for what we were charged for. On the bright side the games were fun and we got to catch bits and pieces of the fight playing ",

We got the triple play, she didn't ask what we wanted on that or about our wings at all. She also took forever and I don't think she smiled one time. The boneless wings were all bread and about the size of a quarter. They were awful.   The front desk lady or hostess, was not nice at all. She had the worst attitude for someone to be working at the front desk of what's supposed to be a fun and happy place!

First of all, it was SUPER crowded. Probably because it's new and exciting, but I had to wait some time for a lot of the cooler games.   The place itself is nice and on a slower day, I could see it being really fun and enjoyable!   The ladies at the front counter where you purchase a play card were super friendly, but almost everyone in the bar area was either not so nice or just plain rude. --- We had a group of 10 that sat at a table at around 1:15am which I guess was cutting it close because the place closes at 2:00am, however we did ask the waitress if it was still okay to order food and drinks at that time. She said it was all right and took our orders pretty quickly. Our food came in almost 30 minutes and we ate pretty fast trying to keep in mind that they were closing soon. Our checks came at a little past 2:00am and we quickly paid and signed the receipts. At about 2:10am, one of the other employees (not our waitress) proceeds to come up to our group, asked if we closed out our checks, and then goes, \"Okay well we're closed.\"    I understand that the place was closed, but we had literally JUST given our waitress our checks. And on top of that, there was definitely more polite ways to ask us to leave...   That encounter definitely didn't leave me in a good mood and in those regards, I think the service could be better. Hopefully they'll get a better handle on it as time goes on, but based on tonight's service, a sour taste was left in my mouth.",

Our buzzer never buzzed and we never heard our name on the intercom so they called us a \"no show\", but we were in the dining/arcade area the entire time.  We tried to see if they could accommodate us, but the hostess said you have to put your name back on the bottom of the list and wait another 45 minutes.  What a waste of time and money.  The food is pricey for the quality of the food.  This doesn't even come close to the D&B in Hawaii.  No \"Aloha\" spirit in Vegas!  Moreover, the hostess needs a class in customer service.  #gameworksgreaterthanDandB",

When I asked our bartender Lauren if she was sure this was correct she assured me it was reposado even though anyone with eyes could see it was not. Later on my husband ordered a sea monster drink solely for the purpose of getting the sea monster that comes with it. He got it and the sea monster was broken. When he asked if he could have one that was not broken he was told \"just super glue it\". I'm sorry but this is just being plain lazy. I understand this bartender was pregnant, but lying to your customers about what you're pouring and giving defective products is unacceptable.",

Both entrees I had were well laid out to be visually appealing and very taste. I ordered the Turkey burger because most places tend to dry the turkey burger patty, here my patty was perfect not soggy or dry like a Las Vegas summer. The sweet potato fries stand the test of being warm and seasoned just right.      As for the rest of the experience our server was funny and attentive. For being extremely busy on the grand opening she kept the drinks filled and when the food was taking longer than normal she apologized and offered to let us go play the games while our food waited.       As for the decor and games, they are great.",

She was so rude to the customer in front of us and to us that I had to ask to speak to the manager. I told him she should not be working the front counter because of her awful attitude and that I was concerned her eyes were going to fall out of her head because she was rolling them back the entire time she was helping the customers. When we left she was still at the counter.  Clearly the manager DOES NOT care about customer service because a woman with that much attitude needed to go home for the day not continue servicing customers who are walking into have a good time. The manager also mentioned this was a reoccurring problem and that I wasn't the first to complain about her. Shame on the manager for ruining paying customer's evenings!!!  For the first time games weren't working and they didn't have enough service employees on the floor.  Hope this isn't how it's going to be from now because we love coming to play the games.  We WILL NOT be coming back if we're going to be treated like garbage because the manager can't train his team members!",

The service was TERRIBLE  aslo it took over a half hour to get service and then it took over a hour to get our food, once we got our food they only check on us once the whole time we where there eating our food.

From the loading of cards, to employees on the floor, everyone was very pleasant.  This place has a lot of cool games and since this place is new, they all work perfectly.  I opted to get the tickets put on the players card instead of carrying around tickets.  There are cups placed around the arcade to hold your tickets which is nice.  The little redemption center was nice because they actually have a mix of cheap dollar store items, and current name brand stuff.  Prizes are way overpriced, but it is to be expected.  When we went, the lowest credit game was regular skee ball at 2.8 credits I believe, most were 8-9.9 credits from what we played.  I guess they do the decimal systems so you don't feel so bad blowing through your money. :) I wish this place was closer, but I will schlep my boys over here to have some fun. I can't give this place five stars due to cost, three kids at the arcade is expensive, yo!  Plenty of parking and pretty easy to find, two thumbs up from me!!",

Then I tried to eat the ribs that were served to me, it was so rubbery and the sauce was not good at all.  I was told it was BBQ sauce but it tasted like teriyaki sauce. My server noticed I wasn't eating my food and asked how it was I honestly told him I couldn't eat it.  I'm not one to complain about my food but it was just terrible.  So my server brought me some buffalo hot wings and they were just as bad.   We ordered beers and were served some beer cocktail they weren't bad but I just wanted the beer not a cocktail.",

Their food is actually pretty good. I've never had a \"bad order.\" I love their spicy habanero sauce that comes with the pretzel dogs and I literally ask for it with any food we order.  The only thing I don't like about the place is the fact that you can't order more than 1 alcoholic beverage at a time. During one visit, we got there 10 minutes before Happy Hour was over so I wanted to order as many drinks as I wanted to drink at a low price but I was told that I couldn't do so because we weren't allowed to share drinks amongst each other (even though we were all over 21 and I wasn't going to shaee).",

Had the caveman combo, ribs was over sauced but as I suspected it was to cover the fact that they was over cooked this dried out! Slider was slider with soggy buns due to the wet pickles being placed on top. The \"golden fingers\"way less than golden more like pale, dry and flavorless. Last but not least the coronarita, I was thoroughly unimpressed. Too much ice, told it was made with patron tequila and did not taste a drop of that. So stick with arcades and beer and you may have an enjoyable experience.",

This was our first time planning our sons 3rd birthday at Dave & Buster's and won't be the last.   Sara went through the option with us and we choose the board room which was perfect for our 40 guests. She was very pleasant, from the beginning she had a great customer service. Once we got there 30 before minutes before the party, the manager (forgot her name :( sorry, she has reddish hair, she was very nice and took us to the room and would frequently come by throughout the party to make sure we are doing okay and if we need anything). Once we got to the room Rebecca from the beginning started helping us, brought whatever we needed, and was hands on and was with us through out the whole time, she is amazing, honestly amazing and I wish her bright future bc of how humble and hard working she is.   Our waiter Luis and waitress, they were fast working, helpful and gave great service, our family and friends were very happy with everyone's service and received the greatest service which made my husband and I very happy.   The food and the entry's were great options and we're delicious and was enough for everyone.   Most important my son, his cousins and friends had an amazing time. OVER ALL WE ARE VERY HAPPY AND WILL BE BACK SOON. Thank you for everyone for helping and making this birthday so much more special.",

She called asst Mgr Avery over.  Avery- you can't use it cause it's half price games. Me- where's it say that?!  Avery- it doesn't, we tell you when you get here Me- it doesn't say that, so your saying I couldn't get the free app if that's what I chose instead,  Avery- nope. Zero coupons on wednesdays.  Me- I came last Wednesday, was told to do survey, with no exclusions mentioned or even printed on receipt. I don't work here, how do I know? Avery- cause I'm telling you now Me- who's the district manager Avery I don't know Me- wow who's store manager  Avery- Phil Me- you are wrong , are you sure you wanna go with this Avery - yes, Avery was nothing but cocky and didn't care. How about do what it takes to make a customer happy? I understand the emails have exclusions. But this receipt survey DOES NOT. I want to speak to the Las Vegas area manager about this.

We had bought tokens in advance online and the cards were not loaded when we got here. The managers could care less and did not try to accommodate at all. They wouldn't even offer us a free dessert or discount. They told us we had to buy more tokens here. I cannot stand horrible customer service!

    "text": "I have been here twice, once just to play games and the second time to eat and play. Both times there was a good amount of people there, but because it is so big it is not an issue. They have happy hour pricing and on Wednesday do half price games.  THE FOOD: We came in and waited right at the front of the first visible dining area and waited about 10 minuets before we were told we could seat ourselves. At least from what we saw, nothing notified you about seating yourself until we asked someone up front. There is also a dining area where they seat you which I didn't find out until reading reviews. Right when we sat ourselves down someone came over and took our order and returned with our drinks promptly. We ordered two different burgers and both were actually pretty good. The only downside was it was a little pricier than what we expected and personally don't think I'd eat there again for my first choice. It is something to try once because most of their menu is over the top which is fun every once and a while. I would recommend checking their menu out online before coming in, and might even say just eat before coming in as dinner and the games add up quickly.   THE GAMES: Hands down the best part. There's a ton of different options and even if it's crowded there's so many games you can always find one open. You get a little card (like a debit card) that you load coins on so you can swipe and play the games. Your points are loaded onto your card after each game and never expire so you can come back and use it again. 200 or so coins lasted us about an hour and a half and we enjoyed every second. The games, based on what I earned, give an awesome amount of tickets. We even hit jackpot on 3 different games just on our last two visits, so the games are easy. The prizes are attainable and not just candy and plastic bracelets.  Go in on a Wednesday for half price games, load $30 onto your card and you will have hours of fun with whoever you are with. This is what we will be doing.",

Being a native of this city, I have only had the opportunity of visiting one other Dave & Buster's in St. Louis, MO. Other than this one being a lot smaller, I'd say they have the same set up pretty much everywhere.  I am personally a HUGE fan of places who cater to families, and not just ones with small children. I am a young mom with a 14 year old, and this place is perfect for a decent priced dinner, and safe entertainment for all ages, especially those older, hard to please young adults. (or parents who'd enjoy a cocktail while playing games) We recently had a work event here as, and it was a huge success. The event/catering staff were so helpful. From set up of our presentation, to lettings us borrow a cord when we didn't have one, down to the salmon, I was impressed!  Sure, you may not get the top of the line steak and seafood, but I don't think you come here expecting that either. I love the prizes they have in exchange for the game play. Shot glasses, and kitchen gadgets, HECK YES!  I would also like to point out that Metro is on property keeping people in line when needed. Their presence is appreciated, when its midnight, people are drinking and getting loud, and unfortunately do not always know how to act. I was pleased to see the police escorting out some obnoxious, disrespectful patrons with their pants down to their knees, a pacifier in their mouths, and loud uncalled for language. And do not be fooled, these were adults. Overall, I am extremely happy with what they have brought to the Downtown Summerlin community, and I welcome them with open arms!",

They get busy, but at least they refill your drinks without waiting 20 mind for a server to come around.   was there last night with a group of friends and we were playing air hockey, I set my watch down because  it came loose. Someone snatched it off the table. ( it was a watch my mother gave me before she passed away) I asked every employee there if they saw it. One one gentleman did and he said it  was where I had set it down at.  He went back and it was gone. Called this morning and nothing.  so to the asshole who stole a watch that was by the air hockey game, I'm glad you have it in your heart to steal someone's watch and keep it. I hope someone takes something of yours of value and keeps it too. Your karma will bite you hard in the ass one day.   I want to ask dave and busters to look at the cameras, but being that I work for a large company, they won't do it because it doesn't involve a crime.",

It wasn't crowded which made our experience a little bit better as well.  We first ate and I liked that they had deals to where certain meals you choose can give you a certain amount of points. Food wasn't terrible but it also wasn't 5-star dining. We got great, fast and friendly service. I like that they have a huge variety of food and drinks on their menu, we also caught them at Happy Hour. I didn't give that 5th star for the quality of the food and prices. Again, food wasn't terrible but wasn't amazing either. It can get a little pricey, two drinks, two meals, an appetizer plus  a little over 250 points added to our players card came out to almost $100.  Your points go by pretty quickly! Loved all the variety of different games but you just keep swiping your card to play to the next minute being out of points which is where it starts to get pricey again. They do have a big variety of prizes that you can cash in for which was a plus as well.  I'll definitely be back. Fun experience overall",

Yet we still had a pretty long wait between getting our orders taken/getting our food/getting refills/etc. If you look at the menu, you know the kind of food you're going to get. Everything is SUPER unhealthy, which usually translates as good, right? I mean, they stuff sandwiches with mac and cheese, how can it not be delicious? The food wasn't good, though. No one got sick, but it wasn't great. I ordered a steak. The server never asked how I wanted it cooked, and it showed up as tough as leather. My friends got things that were much more interesting, all fried and cheesy and covered in barbeque sauce, but no one really enjoyed the food.   I'd come back for the games, but that's about it. It's a shame, too, because half of that whole place is nothing but a bar/restaurant. If you're going to drive away your entire dining business, you might as well use that space for more games.",

Ticket games are pretty fair and they have a nice selection of prizes for all ages.  Ticket prices for prizes are more fair than most comparable places.  Having 2 kids and visiting all sort of arcades and chuck e cheese type places that just offer junk at ridiculously high ticket costs makes Dave & Busters a very welcome option.

He was very nice. We sat ourselves and we're greeted right away by Santana. She even knew it was our first time here. She explained the menu and was very patient with all our questions. The food was great and very reasonably priced for the serving sizes too. Overall this was a great experience and we will definitely be back.",

Every one rhat I encountered speaking to was just amazing and worked with me over and beyond customer service. The first one was Charlie Haskell from their special events- planning quick and easy. Next thing you know i was already signing my contract. But of course like many other parties, there is always last minute changes and details-- enter Ms. Ruffa Mae Fortin and Sheraton who helped me thru the changes in my contract- you will not even hint any annoyance in their voice lol. Email responses are quick , even phone calls. Very easy and accurate planning. And The day comes, Charles - the manager and Holly our server was beyond amazing. All set up are great food are very good and the service are without a hitch.   Its always nice to find perfect people and knowledgeable. Thank you for the awesome service. Looking forward in planning another event.",

This is the first time I've been to this one and one thing for sure is that I will probably only come here to take my kids to play.   Tables are first come first serve so you don't have to wait to be seated. We took the first table that we saw. Table still had to be cleaned so the server said that someone would come by to get it cleaned. About 13 minutes later our server had come out and cleaned up the table himself (maybe the servers clean their own tables?!)  After the table had been cleaned up we waited about another 10-15 minutes for the server to bring our menus and ask for our drinks. At this point I wanted to leave, but we had already waited this long and we were staying afterwards to play. About 7 minutes he has come come to take our order and of course we were ready.   We had ordered a few burgers, a few appetizers, and an entree and of course I had to order an AMF (adios mother F'r) wasn't on the menu but they had made it for me. I usually order this at DNB's and sad to say whoever the bartender was sucks at making drinks.  After our meal, none of us enjoyed our meal, it was oily, not so tasty, and it just wasn't something that I would even want to come back for. Honestly I would have preferred Burger King.   The only thing that I will most definitely be back for are the games, definitely a great place to come and have fun with the family but not to eat!",

We enjoy the drinks and food, although service has to be worked on. I feel like on every occasion something happens with long wait times, no one available to seat you, or just the server period is not the greatest. However on this occasion we had just come to play games not to eat, we did come on a Sunday instead and man i didn't realize how expensive these games were at regular ticket costs. (Sorry spoiled with half off Wednesdays) We loaded our card at the front desk and Rayan provided great service. Walked around played a few games and decided to check out the winners circle for my daughter, as she always gets a few things before we leave. We always save up our tickets so she can get good items instead of the cheap items or candy, waste of money in my opinion. We walked out with 2 squishys and a fingerling. She was ecstatic! On our way out we decided to have dessert and finish up watching the Knights game!!! We won!!!   The midway area were all taken up so we sat in the dining room area which had so much space available. We sat at our table and was greeted by Christian. Christian was super professional and super friendly and provided us with great service! Shocker!!!!   The dessert menu has changed a little we were gonna get the fondue dessert but that was replaced with a new dessert \"Build your own churro sundae\" say what!!!!! Served with caramel and chocolate filled churros, brown sugar cinnamon ice cream and assortment of toppings (oreo crumbles, reese's crumbles,  chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce) I give this a 4/5 $13.49.",

Lots of nostalgic games from my childhood and new games as well. User friendly kiosks to load money onto cards, which I like. No tickets to carry around either. Every point you earn is stored in your card and then redeemed for a prize. Which btw, aren't half bad. Way better than CEC or John's anyway.   I especially liked the sports bar. TVs galore and your typical American pub fare and drinks. Servers are very friendly too. That always makes a difference.",

Petty much?   Saturday night my boyfriend was trying to flag the bartender down and she waved & body rolled her whole body with SO MUCH ATTITUDE like 'I SEE YOU' and then took her time, then when she came over, so much attitude asked for the drink order, stormed away & then slapped the drink down and fanned out her hands like 'here you go highness'.

The bartenders are all very friendly and attentive. We typically order a beer and share the bar burgers and wings platter which is more than enough for the two of us. The food is usually pretty good, although sometimes does not come out as hot as you may hope.    Great place to stop in for a super low key cocktail/beer and snack....

Granted it's a smaller location but it just didn't have the same vibe. There are a bunch of games for kids to do, but beware on what card you get because apparently there are certain cards that are synced to play only certain games. Very disappointing when you have kids who were looking forward to playing any game their little hearts desired. There was no explanation at the front desk that such cards had game restrictions. The guy at the desk only informed us that it was good for an hour from the first swipe. These things should be explained to customers when cards are being purchased so the right cards can be purchased. Then when the cards stopped working, I went to the front desk to ask if they can find out when we first swiped because it felt like short period of time, so the young lady working said its stops at 7. Yet I looked at my watch and it was 738 an has just stopped. So what the heck?  We also decided to grab some food before we played and service was very slow and the food was less than mediocre. We ordered the nachos, Parmesan Caesar salad, pretzel dogs, mashed potatoes and their shrimp and veggie plate. Nachos looked like they were just slopped together, pretzel dogs is something I could make at home and the food just lacked any luster much like their service. The first food runner dropped all our food minus one and I asked if the nachos were coming out and he just walked away. Uhm, ok?   I don't know if I'll be returning anytime soon.",

Bravo twin powers win again! We opted to buy two $50 game play cards since it seemed the best value. The cashier ended up giving us 2 bonus $20 cards for spending over $100, not a bad deal. We signed up at the kiosk registering the cards and for that we will get a coupon for a free $10 card when one spends $10.   The staff was very friendly and helpful guiding the store and how much each card gets with questions we asked. The game floor is amazing and I believe that we lost time in here since when we came in it was light outside then dark when we departed. We enjoy playing the games with tickets since then one can redeem for prizes.   We did not eat here, but there is a bar. I ordered a vodka tonic and it was ok, but people do not come here for the drinks. If one does want to get drunk here drink beer instead. When redeemed our tickets there is a store area where patrons feed them to a machine or one can have the cashiers add them manually. The prizes here are so cool and attainable too. The twins walked away with a bag full of fun and joy, mission of fun and being young accomplished.",

No problem we put our name down and 30 min later we were told that they thought it was a party of 6 and we should have been on a wait list...we did have our name down on said list. Then some high school kid was clearly flustered and said well my manager has me running around trying to find people and trying to figure out where to seat you...clearly angry with us. One member of my group went over and tried to figure out what was going on and one girl had a suggestion of us  sitting at a round top in a closed section and bringing a server over..smart idea as we wanted to eat and chat. The manager replies I would never put a party of 8 at a round top...uh ok...to many servers just standing around not attending to the dirty tables in the bar area and management is a joke! Rude and seemed to turn a lot of people off with her demeanor. hats of to the bar tenders who were the only ones who looked like they were interested in making some money and accommodating a few drink orders....seems odd for a place that just opened to want to keep people in the establishment...we went elsewhere and had a great server and manager was friendly...again I am willing to try again but wait a few months if you are going with a group of 6-8 they aren't prepared for that so give it some time and hopefully with fingers crossed it will calm down and smooth itself out and the shorter blonde manager will calm herself down and not be so condescending in front of customers...",

We ordered the pretzel digs to start and then chicken fingers, Dave's burger medium rare and the bistro steak with shrimp and lobster alfredo. The entrees were delivered before the appetizer and when our friend commented on it, the waitress told him to \"just calm down\" because it would be here soon. My boyfriend's burger was well done, my plate was incredibly hot but my food was luke warm at best and had no taste. The sauce, shrimp and even the steak tasted like absolutely nothing. I couldn't even eat it because we didn't receive our silverware until the manager came over and by then the food was cold. He came over and we sent the burger back and when it was delivered again it was still well done. He decided against a third attempt. The manager, Chris A., was very understanding and took care of us for the rest of the experience.",

I met with the coordinator in person to take a tour with hopes of finally being able to book the room but was told she would send me the contract via email by end of business day. I waited patiently for 4 days to finally get an email that says Hey sorry, we overbooked! Extremely unprofessional and I STILL have yet to receive a follow up email or call about how this going to be resolved. I reached out to corporate to discuss this situation and was directed to a voicemail box which again, no one has returned call. WORST experience of my life!",

We had empty glasses sitting on our table for 10 minutes before he came around to ask if we wanted refills. Then when asking about the food he flat out told us it wasn't good, and that we should only order certain things and then proceeded to name about 3 things that he said were good. Being a server I'm all for suggestions but don't tell a table that the food here is terrible. We knew what to expect when choosing to go to Dave and busters. We order the crispy potato cakes which were actually however we had to ask him multiple times so but the time he brought them to us the food was still barely warm. I understand when a server is busy that they may not be able to get you everything you need as quick as you would ideally like it but when I see you standing around chit chatting with co workers instead of getting things we asked for that's when I get upset. Needless to say our server made our experience terrible.",

    "text": "My friend and I planned on surprising our friend for her birthday with a trip to Dave and Busters (since she had been talking about it for a while). So Friday comes and we eventually make our way for the celebration to begin. We arrived around 4:55pm and it was already crowded. We were all hungry so we wanted to sit and eat first and then we would eventually play games. Well the wait time was about 35 to 55 minutes so we all decided to go to a close restaurant to get some drinks. Well I needed to sneak away to see if they could possibly keep a cake I had ordered for the birthday girl in their fridge along with seeing how long we had left. I was able to meet one of the managers Sean who took the cake for me until we wanted it brought out. Once we got seated our bubbly waitress Breanna came by and welcomed us and took our drink orders along with wishing the birthday girl a Happy Birthday. The appetizer we ordered was the loaded tater tots and it was pretty good. All 3 of us ordered the Sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and bacon wrapped shrimp and creamed corn which we enjoyed. The ONLY thing we agreed on was the bacon wrapped shrimp was very salty (and was way too much fat on the bacon). When we were ready for the cake to come out, let's just say the birthday girl was definitely surprised. Even another waitress ran to get candles and a lighter so the birthday girl could make her wish. The games were great although it was crowded so it was hard to get to play some of the most popular games. Overall the staff was very friendly and it meant a lot to the birthday girl for having the GM Phil stopping by to say Happy Birthday. Now I understand Dave and Busters just opened but the amount of friendliness from the staff we encountered made us want to come back many more times.",

When we discussed our concerns with the manage, he introduced me to Avery at the front counter and told me he would take care of our party.  Avery NEVER did anything!!

He greeted the table after 5-10 minutes of waiting around, didn't get our drink orders until about 5-10 mins after that. During the course of the entire meal, never once did our server look us in the eyes,  explain any specials, say hapy birthday to my boyfriend when I mentioned we were here celebrating his birthday with you guys, and or checked on us. We ordered a burger with fries and ranch and a side salad with ranch. The side salad was not fresh (brown soggy lettus, the tomatoes were mushy, and the mozz cheese on a side garden salad was gross and not complimentary to the plate.). My boyfriend ordered a burger Medium well and it came out medium rare. Food came out decently quickly by a food runner.  Server practically ignored our table the entire time. Never checked to seeif the salad or burger was okay,  never offered us refills. Once the drinks are half full, if its free refills bring a refill without asking. Once food hits the table wait 2-3 minutes and check on table. Finally, the server came over to drop off the check, not even make sure we were kay after 20-30 minutes. Anyways, the food was horrible. I went and got a manager involved and he was nice and took off the salad and the dessert we had ordered. Our server, Mario was horrible, rude, and needs to be retrained. We will NOT be eating there again, but def will be back to play some more games.  Very disappointed with the service.",

The food is way overpriced so we didn't want to eat, just get some drinks, had no idea how to do that, so i asked and was told to just ask the bartender, even if its just a coke.  Very very hard to get the bartenders attention, and couldn't hear the price, so i handed him a ten for two cokes.  Got two bucks back!!  Wow, but they are free refills, so whatever.

Drinks are erroneously cheap, which is amazing and they have a decent liquor selection for whatever your tastes are. They have what they call food, about three choices for HH. Those offerings, and everything else on the menu, is targeted toward people who love Applebees, Nascar, Pizza Hut's newest abomination, vintage Disney and Warner Bros clothes - you get the idea. The act of getting blitzed in their bar is not super horrible at first, as long as you're not hungry. It's the random children running through the bar that offer a stark call back to reality. They cause you to drift your eyes past the blind Tinder dates and CPS violations. Eventually, you'll need to pee, that's when the real magic happens. Stumbling past the video games and future leaders of America is an achievement onto itself. Seriously, they should give out an award for dodging the kids and machines without incident. Onto the restrooms, but only the Men's bathroom. (The temptation to ask about the women's bathroom was overshadowed by the fear of being branded a sexual predator. Seriously, not joking.)  The Men's has the typical urinals and toilets with doors. There are four sinks, in sets of two at either side of the entrance. All sinks were manned by two tuxed-out sink attendants, at 5:30pm on a Wednesday. One man per two sinks, that's right - there's no getting away. They were nice enough, displaying a solid selection of bootleg Drakkar and the like. As I was walking out I began to wonder, do the kids tip in tokens? What type of reaction would occur if a 10 year old grabbed a cigarette, a splash of imitation Armani cologne and dropped a 5-spot in the tip jar? These are questions I pose to you, oh great Yelp reader. If this post teaches you anything, it's that sometimes when life brings you what looks like boneless chicken wings, you take another shot of Jameson (on special).",

We had 30+ guest there.  We had adults standing around and they asked the waiter if they could sit down in another empty table.  The waiter said no, even though my guest were going to order from their menu. (What difference would it have been if they pretended to just walk in..) He said they needed the tables EMPTY.. just in case... This agitated our guest and he and the waiter got into a confrontation. The waiter also using foul language with our guest. While yes, our guest should have just let it go.. and stood there.. even though \"availability permitted\" with the empty tables next to them to sit. The way the waiter handled the situation was uncalled for.  The manager, Rick Cruz instead of handling the situation better and trying to differ a bigger issue. Made it a lot worse. He came out and advised me either my guest needed to leave or EVERYONE. I was shocked as I was trying to collect what exactly happened.  Rick was very malicious and I felt confronted.   Regardless of what we tried to tell him about the situation, he said it didn't matter. He could careless what we had to say. He gave us our only options and it felt like he was mocking our words. \"YOUR guest will say otherwise\", \"I don't believe any of that\", \"okay.. sure!\". It wasn't going anywhere and we knew it was pointless to try to fix the situation.  The way he should have handled it should have been a lot better. He made everyone in the party feel uncomfortable and after I told him he was not making things better.  The guest they asked to leave left.  Regardless the Manager was very hostile and not helping turn around the party into a good celebration for my daughter. We felt unwelcome.  We ended up leaving early, we even left her cake there and she didn't get to enjoy that part with her family and friends. While I know that one of my guest and their employee got out of the hand, it was completely unprofessional for the manager to treat us like crap. No other way to put it, I told him that the way the situation was handled was poor and the party wasn't the same anymore. He said, that was too bad.  This is a family friendly environment and again while I KNOW my guest should have just avoided the situation, the management here needs to stop handling situations like as if it was a nightclub... Never will I suggest this place for anyone.",

Then we went on to play the games, which we all had a blast. They have a lot of selection of games and a $10 playing card actually gets you pretty far game wise. The  confusing part was the way that the servers have to explain the play cards. You have to do it while ordering, and you super charge cards and it really got confusing. Also, the guy who comes around for a \"free\" picture is kind of awkward and was kind of rude. At first he was nice and then brought our 1/2\" by 1\"2 pictures and said he does not get paid and only works on tips. Well we didn't want the tiny picture and none of us had cash, until I realized I did, but it was only $3 and he literally said \" wow that's sad.\" Sorry I don't carry cash, but either way that wasn't even necessary to say, and he stayed there for a minute waiting for one of us to say we had cash, when we didn't. Just an awkward situation. Other than that, it was a really good time, and good date night idea or even place for the kids.",

We were \"that\" table, our party rapidly grew from just a few to 16 of us! Each time he'd come back, we added more and more people. He split all our checks flawlessly!! Kudos to him for our complex table. I know people are quick to write negative reviews, but I wanted to ensure he got a positive one! Games were fun, food & drinks were great! Such a fun night for entire party. We even got a souvenir photo keychain from the photographer, so cute! Thanks again Christian for making our birthday night a positive 1st experience!!!! :)",

Took her over 20 minuets to get us just RANCH claimed she \"tried\" by telling others to get it for her but ran to the back when the male patrons asked for barbecue sauce. The male bartender that covered her break or whatever was freaking AMAZING and didn't even serve me a drink and he still catered to my husbands and i needs didn't get his name though.

I come here for happy hour, all the cocktails are half priced so it's nice to be able to try out the whole menu rather than paying $10 for each drink. And as far as the food on happy hour, I wished they had more... they have spinach dip, chicken quesadilla, wings and I forgot what else for only $5. On drinks, so far I've tried the watermelon coronita (good), island coconut coronita (didn't like), backwoods blueberry lemonade (would order again) they give a little shot glass on the side with strawberry moonshine. Next time I'll probably try the food and play some games",

When I come, there are a lot of people but there is always a different game to play. I have ate the restaurant only once. My husband and I had shared this pasta dish with steak as a quick snack before going to play. It was yummy and I do remember the service being great. I will continue to come back and encouraging others to do so. :)",

I literally had to ask my server, who looked and acted like she didnt want to be here, if they had other ingredients so i could \"improvise\" and make my own flavors. To top it off, she wasnt even knowledgable of the menu and couldnt give me  happy hour prices for the commonly ordered items, such as beer. Not only that.... you dont serve pitchers yet you have beer towers. I mean great and all but kinda missing the concept. Overall, this place blows more than the late night alley girl on Fremont St. Not worth the money to spend here on food and specials.",

    "text": "Where to begin...  I went to Dave & Busters for the first time last night. The experience with the gaming side, fantastic, the gentleman at the front was very helpful. We had a great time playing the games. I had left my cell phone on a game and someone had turned it in and an employee was able to recover it quickly for me. I was very happy at this point.  We went to eat and that is where it went DOWN HILL. Our waitress, Jasmine, was the worst server (Jasmine) I've ever had at any restaurant, from Florida, to Iowa, California, Thailand and all over the world. This waitress (Jasmine) was incompetent of doing her job. Jasmine was slightly rude, but the biggest issues was she was dealing with the public, when I would only allow her to be a dish washer, or table busser.   Jasmine NEVER asked any one at our table if we wanted refills, checked on how the food was, or seemed to give a rats behind about anything.   I ordered a boneless hot wing meal with fries. Then Jasmine told me the happy hour specials which they had half off boneless wing appetizer. So i decided to order that way instead since it is cheaper. Jasmine didn't offer when I said I wanted boneless wings so that was irritating she wasn't trying to HELP.   I told Jasmine I wanted 2 orders, because it's a happy hour special and considered an appetizer, I wanted to get one early since I knew it would take 45 minuets to get the food. I would take the fries with the second order.   Jasmine brings the food, and I ask her about the fries, she first tells me she put them with the second order (which is what we talked about) then tells me she decided not to put the second order in yet because she got busy. Well so glad you decide to do what you would like with MY order. I asked her how long it would take for the second order, and she said 7 minuets (that would of been wrong) and I said don't worry about it. I was already irritated and not going to wait another 30 minuets. Jasmine ask if I still want the fries and I said sure, she said it would take 5 minuets. 20 minuets later I flag her down and tell her to not worry about the fries.  Jasmine then tells me the reason the fries didn't come out with the first order (we didn't order it that way I'm now thinking she's on drugs) because she ordered it with the second order.  WRONG, YOU ALREADY TOLD ME YOU DECIDED TO NOT PUT THE ORDER IN BECAUSE YOU WERE BUSY AND FORGOT. So now Jasmine lied to me and tried to blame someone else when she already admitted she did wrong.  Two of us ask for the bill, Jasmine brings his, not mine, takes his and brings it back and leaves. Finally brings my check to me. Charging me for 1 order of wings, and a order of fries. I give her my card and ask her to fix this.  Jasmine comes back 10 minuets later with the updated check (fries cost $1.88 and comps me $1.29) this makes no sense. I notice she didn't bring me a ticket to sign and put the total on.   I can't take it anymore, this girl was slow, incompetent, rude, and didn't give a crap that she was turning away first time customers of this place of business.  I see another waiter and ask for the manager. She comes over, I tell her the story, and she apologized and didn't charge me for the 1 order of happy wings I had, and I paid for the 1 beer (would of had more but the waitress never offered or asked). I told her I would be happy to tip a buss person as I am not cheap nor trying to get out of paying, but this girl would received a $0.00 tip. She said they tip out at the end of the night.  You are only as good as the people you work with.I offered to tip the busser, but the manager let me know the wait staff tips out. I paid my exact bill $6 and some change for the beer.   I will NEVER return to this place, my coworkers who were with me will not return as she was rude to them, and I hope this girl is not a waitress at any place I visit. If Jasmine is, I'll leave.  Unhappy customer.",

The sliders were okay at best, but the ribs were horrible. First they couldn't even manage to cut them properly between the bones. All four of the ribs I got were cut directly through the bones so you had pull them apart to eat them. They would have been better off just leaving them all attached. I could have looked past this if they at least tasted okay...fail... I don't think that I have ever had BBQ ribs that crunched before. It was as if they put them in a microwave and forgot about them.  I did have fun playing the video games with my sons which is why I gave them 2-stars. An old guy like me was able to reminisce while having a good time.   I also had what was probably the most watered down margarita ever made. I will go here again but only for the games and maybe during happy hour to sit at the bar and drink beer during a football game or something. Then again...probably not.",

I've seen more reviews on here about how he sucks so I'm glad other people are noticing. I will absolutely not give them another chance, ever.",

    "text": "My family stopped by Dave and Busters after eating at Lazy Dogs on a Saturday evening just to have fun in their arcade section.  The prices are really expensive after their promo/deal hours. We arrived at 7:00 P.M and were charged their general prices. We received 135 chips for $25.00 (I added $2.00 for gratuity).  With it being so packed, the arcade selection was limited. You typically had to wait for a ride or a special arcade. My daughter was quite disappointed that she couldn't play some of her favorites like the Transformers or Jurassic Park. We typically play those games at Chuck E Cheese.  Compared to other arcades in the valley D&B is relatively expensive. I don't think I'll be back here anytime soon unless it's during a promo or weekday with a special pricing package. I can't comment on their bar or food since we didn't stop in that section.",

They have a bar with seating and tv's,  separate restaurant area, plus many many arcade games, even space invaders...lol and interactive games.  When you decide your hungry, just go over to the restaurant area, they take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready. Tonight I must have been lucky, because the turn around time was 5 minutes.  The games use a card to play. You purchase tokens for different prices. The more you pay, the more you save ultimately. We bought 2 of the $56.00 dollar token packages.   We got chicken and waffle sliders ( very very sweet ),  philly Cheesesteak sliders,  sliders and BBQ ribs, nachos,  4 horseman,  blueberry lemonade,  passionfruit mojito, green tea shots,and beer.   The prices were fairly reasonable.   The location is Downtown Summerlin Mall- ample parking, plus this mall has valet parking as well.",

They were a little busy in the main dining room so there was going to be a little bit of a wait, but we found out that the bar had open seating and as long as the seats weren't white, the kids were allowed in that area which left for a ton of open seating.

MAYBE IF YOU CAME BY AND TOOK OUR ORDER WE WOULDN'T HAVE WALKED OUT!!! id totally understand if she were busy. but not even a drink order. she had ONE table & thought that cleaning a dirty table was more important than serving us.",

Whether you're looking for some games for healthy competition, strength or just to challenge yourself, you'll find them here and spend hours laughing and by the end of it, high-fiving or rubbing your loved ones nose in it!  First off, D & B offers a great amount of options in terms of how many points you'd like on your card and how much $ you're willing to spend in one trip. Your card is reuseable and any points left stay on the card for your next trip, as well as the credits you can spend in the gift shop. Want to keep saving up for that big gift or can't find anything you want to spend your credits on this time around? Don't worry, they'll stay on your card and I'm told they won't expire either.  The games themselves have been switched out lately. Since going there this month, I've seen a lot of new, different and big games, some even appear to be rides, that you can try! There are some more up-to-date games, more walk-in, interactive games and a virtual reality game too.  Fear not though, they have kept a lot of favourites, including the coin drop, the basketball hoop toss, pacman and air hockey.  Service is okay, but rarely needed for a few hours of playing on the arcades as far as I'm concerned, so there's not too much to comment on and the restrooms are always well maintained.  On any day, but especially the rainy ones we've had lately, D & B's is a great idea and fun for everyone.",

The cocktail menu doesnt show the prices but everything is around 11-12 dollars. The food is reasonably priced and pretty good. Of course you wont get a high end meal here but I think it is a decent bar food. The only thing I wasnt amused by the unnecessary wait when we were trying to purchase our ticket. Something was wrong with the system and we were waiting for the authorized person to fix the problem for 15minutes. Than all of the sudden 3 different person came to help, but in this point the end of the line was on the street.  I tried several different things but my absolute favorite was the virtual reality. I had to learn that you cant use your credits towards this so we had to pay an extra 12$ to try it which is fine although the system didnt work .. again so we had to go back and forth from the virtual reality to the front desk. They have some serious issues with the computers.  I also tried some cocktail of course so many options and so unique. They make the cocktails worth it and fun to drink so big thumbs up for that. All in all I couldnt ask for a better first arcade experience, I had a great time",

We decided to eat first and play after. We sat in the \"open\" seating. It took me a few minutes to decide what to eat so we placed our order around 8:20pm at that time I also ordered one of their \"sea monster\" drinks honestly mostly because I wanted the monster. Our sever returned with the drink with out the monster and said sorry were out. Ok I understand it does say while supplies last but why wouldn't she come over first and let us know. Anyways I accepted the drink and took one sip and it was so watered down it tasted like water with a hint of mango.. Our server never came back to check on us to see how the drink was or to see if we needed refills on our other drinks 30 minutes later after being ignored my husband and I walked to the hostess stand and told her we were leaving. She said okay not to worry about the soda and she apologized. As we were walking out our server magically appeared and said the would cash us out for our drinks. She brought the bill and my husband informed her about the aweful drink and that we would not be paying for it being I took one sip out of it she said \" Well I'm not the bartender\". After we payed we left we will and we will not be back.",

    "text": "Dave and Busters has finally made it to Las VEGAS but too bad the great service and management did not come along with it. Today I went to D&B to watch some football with my family and was very disappointed in the service that I was provided. We got there around 1:00 to sit down and accordingly with it being the first Sunday of football we had to wait about 30 mins to be seated. Once seated we were greeted by our waiter Danny and he took our order everything seemed as if it were going to go well. We ordered 2 orders of the unlimited wings and an order of Nachos I ordered the wings that were suppose to be BBQ and my fiance friend ordered buffalo wings. We sat there for about 45 mins before anything came out food wise. Our waiter told us the Kitchen was backed up so the order was taking longer than usual. When the food that did come out came it was wrong and the server that brought it out got a little attitude when I told him that. They brought out 2 orders of Buffalo wings when I ordered the BBQ. At this time the Nachos still did not come out. 10 mins later my waiter came by asked me if my food was okay and I told him what happened. 20 more mins later my wings came out correctly but still no Nachos. Our waiter Danny walked passed about 3 times not addressing us so we finally stopped him and asked about the Nachos he said \"Let me go check\" and never came back. 20 more minutes passed and my fiance Nachos still did not come but the person seated next to us that ordered after us received their Nachos. Once again we asked the waiter about our food and he said let me go check on it. 10 more mins passed and they finally came out which would be 1hour 30mins after we ordered them. By this time the rest of our group showed up. They sat there for about 15 mins before any waiter asked them what they would like. So we ordered with an entirely different waiter. At this time we also ordered a refill on our wings. My cousin who joined us ordered an order of regular wings and fries for herself and her daughter not the unlimited. Their orders came out about 20 mins later but we're cold like it had been sitting on a table not even under a heat lamp so they sent them back. They brought out another order of wings but it was an order of refill wings not their original order so at this time we asked to speak with a manager the Manager came in (a white dude with a red beard and bald head) and was slightly rude and told us that we had an attitude and that we should just eat the food and he would bring more out which I find very rude as a customer. Then after that the general manager Phil came out he told us that we allegedly threatened his staff and that we had to leave. I will NEVER eat at this D&B again they have poor service and their staff members are rude and unprofessional so many of them rolled their eyes and gave attitude when we asked them to correct their coworkers mistakes. I really hope that they turn things around because it sucks that one of my favourite places to go eat and drink was such a horrible experience. I will definitely being sending my issues up to the corporate office on Monday morning.",

Hostesses gave us 20-30 min wait, ended up waiting over 2+ hours after constantly going up to the host stand getting updates on when we would be seated. Once sat, our server was really nice but when she tried to give back our ID's for the alcohol she specifically said, \"I don't know which one is which, all of you look the same\" and the ID's she took were a mixture of men and women. Not only that but to top it off we still had full glasses of beer on the table and one of the workers (assuming he was the manager) told us, \"I know you guys are having a good time but unfortunately we're closed and you have to leave\" at that point we just digested our food and trying to relax and converse with one another and it was a little after midnight. That's not how you treat your customers Dave and Busters, please re-evaluate on how customer service is really handled.",

The host don't care nor the managers.  The host are super young and don't care. I talk to a manager about it and they just blow me off and tell me it's busy. Of course it's busy it's a Friday but that is no excuse for their terrible service. I was wondering why other people were leaving bad review and I see why. I was literally  passed off so much I was cussing at the manager just so he gets the point. I would never eat their again. Rather eat somewhere else then just drink and play games.  I warn you now!!! DO NOT EAT HERE. FOOD IS OK BUT SERVICE SUCKS!!!! If I could leave no stars I would. I don't think the food area should be in business. With all these other reviews please understand how bad it is. Just eat somewhere else then just drink because your never going to get a table when they say.",

Wow, he rushed us through dinner the whole time and they weren't even busy. He asked if I wanted a box, I said no and then he grabs my plate. Wtf?! I said, I'm not done!

Saw other bartenders playing n spraying the water gun behind the bar soon after she said they were broken. I'm sure she had been on her shift fr a while/ hours because it was passed 9pm. Long enough to figure out whether the guns worked. Plus we saw other patrons with iced water and we asked another bartender if the guns wer broken and he no. I ordered happy hour food that never arrived. Which caused me to miss play time with friends. Told another bartender( other than Linda bevause she's terrible) he didn't do anything about it(that was another 10-15min wait). So instead of askin again I went to a manager instead. Manager gave me a play card. By then my friends were just about done playing so I gave it away to some kid. Waited a total of 45+min. Overall bad experience. I will never return.",

He flirted with every girl at our table, told us we weren't his only table so we needed to relax, rarely came by and asked if we needed anything, forgot to put in one of our party member's meal, and brought out plates one at a time. While I was eating my food my other party members still had not gotten theirs. When my girlfriend's grandma talked to the manager, Adam, and asked if they could do something for us since the food was cold and the fact it took forever he replied \"I don't like being demanded what to do.\" So we just decided to leave. Very expensive food that was cold and took forever to come out. Horrible service.",

    "text": "Went there last night and had a lot of fun playing the games. It was even half price token night which was really cool. They have a great selection of video, ticket and carnival games. Very innovative games and alot of stuff that I've never seen before. Then we went to get food...... first let me say that the wife and I both work in restaurants on the strip but try not to be super critical because we realize that the casinos are more strict about the customer service aspect of the job. We walked up to the hostess(Danielle) and asked her if kids were allowed on the dining side to which she answered with a very short yeah and then just kinda looked at us. I said \"three\" because I felt it was my responsibility to break the awkward silence. She then walked us to the table and set the menus down and walked away without saying anything. We thought maybe she was just having a bad night but the longer we sat there we noticed her turning around to glare at us on several occasions and even saw her walk a couple to their table while literally looking up at the ceiling rolling her eyes. She looked very unfriendly to say the least. After that the server came over and was really nice. Her name was Jasmine. We ordered the pretzel dogs and the rib,chicken and shrimp platter. Everything was awesome! The ribs were delicious. We finished everything and decided to order the regular order of ribs but wanted to sub out the honey bourbon barbeque for the sweet chili sauce we had already gotten because my wife is allergic to alcohol and we really like the first set of ribs. Any way long story short the ribs came out with the bourbon bbq sauce and not the sweet chili soy that we requested. We told our server and she said she would fix the problem and bring them back for us. Then the manager came to the table and asked what the issue was with the ribs. We told him we just wanted the honey chili soy sauce instead of the bourbon bbq to which he rudely replied \"did you even try the sauce? Because i did and those ribs had the chili sauce on them.\" I explained that we just got the trio and the sauce that came on the 2nd ribs was absolutely not the same as the 1st set from the trio. The sauce was darker and looked more like bbq sauce than the 1st set from the trio. The manager seemed annoyed so we got upset and just cancelled the ribs and left. So all in all the gaming arcade aspect was amazing! Restaurant side was mediocre.....I left feeling very annoyed about the manager arguing with me even though he was the one who didn't know what he was talking about. I thought management was supposed to make the situation better not worse.",

However every time I have family in town, they always want to go here. Each time we dined in, the service has been consistently slowwww even when they aren't crowded. The waitress I got the first time was rude and didn't know anything about the menu. When we wanted dessert, I asked if there was anything with cinnamon in it (I have a terrible allergy). She said she would check on it and when she came back she said she wasn't able to find out so \"I just wouldn't do it\" was her reply. The second dining experience was a little better. Still incredibly slow, but the waitress was way nicer although she didn't smile as much.",

They are super busy and there is a lot of people inside!! How can they seat everyone at the same time, they cant make people eat/drink fast just so you can be seated sooner! Anyways, my husband and I went to D&B yesterday afternoon. It was packed with people! We knew it would be busy given the fact that they just opened not too long ago. Before starting to play some of the games, we decided to get the buzzer for the eating area because they looked busy! The wait was 15-30 minutes to be seated. The game selection was great and we did not really have to wait long for any of the games. After playing for about 20 minutes our buzzer turned on, we went to be seated. Our waitress was accommodating, there was a lot of waiters/waitresses, more than we were used to. It took awhile for our appetizer to come out, we ordered the nachos, they were very good!! Soon after our meal was ready. I had the linguine pasta with shrimp and steak over lobster Alfredo sauce, it was delicious!!! My husband had something else, not sure what it was but it tasted good! lol it was a fun place!!",

Service was shit, waitress' had an attitude and most of the time we had to hunt her down in the sea of insanity in order to receive service. Gave this place a second chance because I do love the food, and was told that it was open seating, meaning, once a seat opens up, whoever sat down first got it. So.... There was awkwardly groups of people staring at everyone eating for a chance to be the first one to the table when it cleared... where the hell do they do that shit at?

The games are super cool and that part is definitely 5 stars, this review is solely on the restaurant. The food overall is not that great I ordered the appetizer boneless buffalo wings with fries. Service was alright, nothing great. The worst part comes at the end. I'm a person who works in the service industry and understand how important tipping is and usually tip people well when they deserve it. I gave our server (who I didn't catch his name) a 15% tip on around a $7 bill. As my friends and I were leaving the restaurant area our server confronted us (a group of girls) and continued to say \" Hey you guys, just so you know you should really take care of your server/bartender in the future you know we work off of tips\" yada yada... I was SO taken aback by the comment and that he even said something to us and I just looked at him and said \"yeah I get it I work for tips too\" and walked away and continued to tell him manager how unprofessional, offputting, and rude his comment was. I still cannot believe that a server would think it's okay to say something like that to a guest. Wish I would've given him a $0 tip now. Dave and busters is a cool place but you guys really need to get better waiters who know what costumer service is.",

He made jokes with our kids, made menu recommendations and also explained how the games worked and got us our game cards. The menu was extensive and our food was absolutely delicious! We expected  stale tasteless bar food but this was far from it! Mmm my sirloin, shrimp and lobster pasta dish was one of the best things I've had in a long time.

I went to sit at the bar this evening with a few girlfriends enjoying our night off from the service industry, ordered what I thought was a jack and coke turned out to be Jameson, the bartender who served is 'Mike' I guess it was his first night behind the bar from being a bar back (that's what the girl bartender told us) and the girl bartender was trying to help him along the way but was too busy to honestly care about his side of the bar. We ordered our first round gave a card to be put on file, talked to Mike about ordering loaded cheese tots and hot dog pretzels. I guess he didn't put the food order in. We were waiting for our 2nd round of drinks about 20 mins in, the girl bartender asks us if we want another round and if we wanted food, we asked her if Mike put in our order, he never did, so she put in the order for loaded cheese tots and pizza pretzels, wrong item came out... it was a mess... we ordered another round after asking for drinks two more times from Mike that he never made, we sat with empty drinks for a while. After the drinks came, When closing out we asked for a manager to explain the process of what happened, the manager AMAN came over and we told him the situation. The first question before greeting us was the question if we ate the item. We said \"yes after waiting an hour bc the bartender didn't put in our order and the kitchen was about to close. The manager AMAN had so much attitude with my friend and told her \"well I was going to take care of it but now\" and put the receipt back on the bar top, told us to pay on the bar and walked away. It was completely out of line. If he would of just tried to hear our story instead of being so rude this whole experience could of been different. I was so taken back by this experience, especially coming from a manager. I do not always agree with the customer is ways right slogan however, I do agree with being kind no matter the situation. This manager was not kind, i believe that a strong leadership comes from the top and this is not how to run a successful establishment.",

It was delicious although I was super hungry by the time it arrived. I will have to give them another chance sometime.",

It took her a long time to return with our cards (so she can copy all of our credit card information). The next day while I am at work i get fraud alerts from the credit card i used at dave and busters stating i purchased $200+ worth of stuff at albertson and $160+ at home depot. She was the only one who handle my card out of my sight. I contacted the rest of my party to see if I was the only one who got my credit card information stolen and three others in my party are also victims of identity theft. Beware of this place of business. Do NOT use credit cards especially if your waitress is JASMINE. She will steal your information and shop at home depot. I called dave and busters on 1/29/17 to speak to a manager. I spoke to the service manager name jamie, she said she would notify the general manager and i will be getting a call on 1/30/17. Today is now the 31st and still no call back. I hope this isn't a dave and busters employee group activity, to steal peoples credit card information.",

    "text": "Stopped by to try it out and see about having my daughters birthday party there. The minimum was \"was\" $250 for 10-20 people, which I thought was perfect. I had no problem paying more if we went over, just because my daughter wanted to have it there. The food is okay at best and they are small portions for the money. Wait staff is constantly up selling the the power cards for the video games, which is annoying, (just get me another beer or refill on a soda). The video games are great, that is the only upside to this place. After about a 2 weeks of constant badgering with phone calls and emails to try book the party, we finally made contact. Key word is, \"we\" made contact. We spoke with a person by the name of Veronica, who said, the price is now $1,200! WTF? A $950 increase! I hope to get a response from management, they have yet to call me! #daveandbusters",

Even the couple next to us was complaining and saying they didn't taste like they have alcohol. And the head bartender says it's normal , 1 1/4 oz of alcohol, meaning sweet, sweet sweet yukkiness. And aside from the horrid amount of time waiting to order a drink, or another one (yeah youre still thursty after one or two, and you don't got anywhere to go) you ask the bartender lady how much is a beer, and she won't give you a straight answer, her answer, $1.00 Off, well $1.00 off what? Its a big secret, obviously trained to not answer, just the same as the reason they put in EXACTLY 1/14 OZ. of alcohol, thats the way it is nowadays, need to maximize profit, put in 30 cents worth of booze instead of 50 cents, but gotta make that money, but people like me, we won't come back, and neither will the couple that sat next to us, and I'm sure more....the place could be a rocking place, just another cheap establishment.",

We were in line to buy the game cards and credits and some untrained worker came up to me and basically said you can't have that water throw it away. We weren't even in the gaming area yet. Waiting in the long ass line where they only had one cashier working. I approached a rude manager and said what if customers have dietary restrictions where they need water? I'm 7 months pregnant and it's starting to get hot outside. That manager didn't give two shits. We were going to eat at the restaurant but even the employees working in that area were miserable. No smiles, no thank you, shit they didn't even greet us. We approached the counter and all they said was what's your phone number? That is not the way to run a business. We left and went to eat somewhere else. I definitely wasn't going to give Dave and busters any of my time or money.. if you want horrible customer service this is the place for you. I will never return to Dave and busters. This location ruined it for me. If I could this place would definitely get 0 stars.",

    "text": "Aman needs to be fired. Simple as that. I've been in the service industry for 15 years and have never been so disrespected at any establishment in my life. Seeing as how I'm in the same line of work, I am very understanding and forgiving. However, I will never tolerate someone that is rude and disrespectful, especially someone in a managerial position. You literally have one job, which is to ensure that your staff is providing excellent customer service and if service is falling short it is your responsibility to correct the problem at hand. Aman, you failed at this with flying colors. The bar staff was very friendly and apologetic, though service was very lacking. Showed up to the established around 10:15, bar closes at 12. Ordered a round of drinks, one drink came out incorrectly but was consumed nonetheless, no big deal. Attempted to order food, pretzel dogs and loaded tots, waited about 20 minutes before inquiring about our food which we soon came to realize was never ordered due to miscommunication between the bar back and bartender. No big deal, ordered another drink and the food was apparently put in this time around. Food finally came out about 20 minutes later but the order was wrong, we were delivered some sort of pizza bites tho 2 of us don't eat cheese and specified the cheese to be on the side for the tater tots anyways. Then we were told the kitchen was closing so we said no bid deal we will survive without it but were convinced it was no big deal and we could get the proper order with no issues. The proper item was delivered after another 20 minutes and another slow round of drinks later (it's been over an hour now, mind you). But the food showed up nonetheless and it was good after all. However, after all is said and done the bill was dropped and the original incorrect item was on the bill. When acquiring why the original charge was still on the bill, we were informed that it was because both items were the same price. However, after waiting over an hour to get a proper item delivered, it was obviously ludicrous to be paying full price for the staffs mistakes as well as their  lack of sympathy. That is when we asked to speak to a manager. This is when Aman stepped up to the plate to disappoint us further. Aman instantly came over with an attitude, he made it very clear right off the bat that he had no interest in hearing the problem at hand. His first instinct was to assume we were just trying to get a free hand out, which was not the case at all. We had already ordered 10 drinks and 2 food items within the hour and a half we were there and money was no issue. It was the lack of communication and management that was the problem. Though Aman showed no interest in hearing what we had to say, I proceeded to tell him the issues we experienced. He instantly got defensive with us and I explained that if a food item is refired for any reason, it is his responsibility (as the manager on duty) to be aware he f the issue and correct it. He apparently had zero insight that there was even an issue in the first place, which is a major problem. He instantly accused us of trying to get a free item since we \"ate the whole thing\" mind you we waited over an hour for said item and that's after it was negligently never put into the computer and then ordered incorrectly after the fact. He then decided the best way to solve said problem was to tell the customer (aka me and my two coworkers) that he WAS going to help us, but now we can pay full price. He clearly didn't like my 2 cents on how he was failing to do his job. Very mature coming from a grown man in a managerial position. Like I said, I've been in the industry for over a decade, I know how to properly solve guest issues and I have had many managers who know how to do their job. Aman is a disgrace to the industry and if he remains in management, he will run this business into the ground. Simple as that. If you wonder why you have a 3 star rating, you should probably start by shopping your horrible staff.",

    "text": "I have never been so disappointed in an establishment. We stopped in for a quick drink and snack around 10:30 pm. Knowing they closed at 12. Service was a bit slow, although very friendly. We were informed it was Mike's first night and he used to be a barback. The bartender Afton was very nice. Once we had our first round we asked each of them for another. Got one. Then waited. And waited. The bar was busy and all 3 of us are in the industry so we gave the the benefit of the doubt. We then mentioned to Mike we wanted to order food. We were joking around and he laughed and said ok and walked away. It was about 20 mins later and we asked Afton if our food was about ready. She said Mike didn't put it in and so she did. We were just enjoying ourselves on a girls night out so we ignored it... Then the food came out wrong. She thought we ordered pizza bites. But we said pretzel bites. But was strange since we said we don't eat cheese and the pizza bites have cheese all over them.. Easy mistake? The kitchen was about to close so we said forget it. But she insisted and said it was fine so we said ok. They finally came out and they were closing so we got the bill. I then asked if the pizza bites and pretzel bites were the same price and they informed us they were after much discussion... And we asked if they were sure and they said yes(we didn't see the menu again, they had been picked up) and so my friend asked to speak to a manager just to inform him of the issue. We weren't trying to get anything for free. Should we have paid for them, no. Were we going to, yes. The manager Aman came over asked asked 'what our problem was'. We explained and then He then was very condescending and asked us why it was a problem was since \"we ate them all\" . Of course we ate them. We ordered them and there was nothing wrong with them. We just waited an hour. My friend then was just telling him that he should've just checked on the situation and maybe ran the refired item in question and he seemed very unaware of what had been going on in the bar area and with his guests.. We hadn't seen him touching base with any customers all night. He then thrust the receipt at us and said he \"WAS going to take care of it..But now we can just pay\" and stormed away. I have never been so spoken down to in such a condescending way by a 'manager' in my entire life.  If this was a restaurant on the strip he would NEVER have spoken to us that way. Whether we had 1 drink or 11 there was no reason for him to be that rude. I know that if we had a man with us he never would have spoken to us in such a manner. His body language/attitude and management skills are severely lacking. A manager should be leading by example. Which is extremely upsetting. Its sad that a \"fun\" place such as D&B would EVER employ such an individual. Get it together. I'm not a huge negative yelper but this was completely unacceptable, and a way in which guests should never be treated and everyone should be aware.",

First off, it took nearly an hour to get a table but we were okay with that since we decided to play first. It then took a while to get our drinks, we were okay with that too because once again, it was busy. Here's where it went downhill fast, we weren't given straws for the drinks. It was a problem considering the kids cups have lids on them. We flag someone down to get us straws and he brings one... I explained that the whole table needed straws thinking my bad that I may have not made that known. Yeah, he literally brought another single straw. Our family giggled because it was a little mind boggling but whatever. Food came in at a decent time but we didn't have any silverware and our waitress was standing talking to another table...for at least 15 minutes. The manager in the mean time was bussing the table next to us. Like where are the bussers? We let the server know that we didn't have any silverware and we asked for some ketchup and ranch. He then made the comment of oh wow you guys don't have anything on your table! Well yeah that's why we asked you. We sat there waiting to eat because we needed forks and at this point we just asked the manager who was still cleaning the table next to us. He brought out the silverware and everything else we needed including refills because once again waitress was mia. The server then comes back with the silverware a little too late because the manager had already done it. We ate the food, which wasn't bad but we never actually received the ranch that was asked for numerous times. We had to once again flag someone down for more refills since the waitress decided again to hang out at the other table and guess who brought the refills....the manager. We let the manager know that hey she hasn't really done anything and has been standing at the other table for a while now. I honestly felt bad for the manager because he was working his tail off and his staff is useless. The waitress did make it back one more time to say sorry, is there anything else and here's the check. Food was okay, service was absolutely terrible. We will definitely be back to play games and that's it.",

First and foremost, Dave and busters isn't known for awesome food nor are they known to be fancy, so with that being said, the service should be somewhat decent. Our server, Johana, seemed to be bothered by our existence. I get it, long day dealing with people or whatever the issue may be, but keep your problems to yourself and welcome to corporate America my friend. Fake a smile, pretend you like your job and be grateful you even have one. The service industry is tough, I understand that... But if your sole job is customer service, simple math calculations (cashiering) and serving and you can't do any of those qualifications that you were asked/expected of you, why did you apply for this job? We had a giant group that came in and she didn't want to put the tables together and expected us to stand around one small table. She then made a comment that we were mean cause we asked to move the tables together and we even offered to move them ourselves and put them back. Not sure how that was mean of us? We ordered a beer tower which took 30 minutes to get and the lady behind the counter gave it to us because Johanna didn't want to serve us the beer. She asked someone else for whatever reason. She didn't apologize for the wait nor did she apologize for the crummy attitude. She gave us the bill with no receipt and change only which seemed weird. We asked for the itemized receipt which she was hesitant to give us because she shorted us the change to keep as tip. When she got caught, she gave us the proper change and gave some lame excuse on why the change was wrong. Thanks Dave and busters for hiring thieves and incompetent people.",

Appetizer: we ordered the buffalo wings, mozzarella stix & tater tots combo to share & that was delicious... especially the tots with the cheese, bacon & chive fixens.  The cheese could have been a little more melted instead of hard, may need to change the cheese to one that melts better.  Susannah our hostess was amazing, she took care of us!  I ordered the steak salad, although the greens & fixings were delicious, the steak could have been a better cut.  It had no flavor & was dry, even at medium, it was tough.  A flank steak would have been a better alternative (more tender, flavorful).  It is noisy from all the games that are in there but the bar is well stocked & plenty of HUGE tv screens to catch  games.",

What irks me the most is the no outside water bottles policy. I came in about half an hour after they opened to grab Brian to go to lunch after I got done with a class at Sephora. I had a water bottle that was half full and I was stopped and told I couldn't come in. Why? As if I'm sneaking vodka in? In the words of St. Peter in Acts 2:15 \"These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine (10!) in the morning!\" Nobody is trying to get crunk at a D&B on the DL before noon, so don't make me chug my water at the door. (As if D&B is pressed for coin...)  I wouldn't come to this location in the future and would not recommend.",

    "text": "Recently opened in Downtown Summerlin and already making a splash with locals looking to escape the summer heat, I was a bit of a surprised that Dave & Buster's had not already made its mark on Las Vegas considering the fact that I'd previously visited locations in Detroit and Columbus as far back as the mid-90's, dining never really the \"focal point\" but the arcade a lot of fun and the televisions plentiful for watching college football games.  Originally founded in the early 1980s, and now nearing their 90th store Nationwide, Dave & Buster's at Downtown Summerlin inhabits the space directly across from Regal Cinemas and featuring a vast floorplan of Food, Games and Sports it was just prior to 6pm that our party checked-in at the podium, reservations well-advised during primetime hours, though any wait-time could easily be spent on the video games.  Seated at a sturdy four-top to the right of the bar, a ton of Televisions positioning Dave & Buster's nicely as *the* place to watch Football, Big Events or UFC in the nearly two-year old shopping center, it was with surprisingly efficient service for a place so new that the evening got started, plenty of managers circulating with the use of headsets allowing the team to fill coverage gaps as small groups continued to file in just as two sizable birthday parties sequentially got situated.  Energetic but not exactly \"loud\" considering the concept, a bulk of the noise merely that of pop-music and conversation as the gaming area sits a fair distance from the food and drink, positive attitudes and smiles seem to be part of the culture at Dave & Buster's and although the several-page menu may at first seem daunting, the size is mostly a result of pictures with server's recommendations helping to narrow the options into a list that is both well-culled and fair priced.  Obviously not to be confused as fine dining, but at least on par with the rest of the outdoor mall in terms of quality and mass-appeal, the order at Dave & Buster's was intended to take a broad look at some of their classics as well as the new Summertime selections, a trio of adult-beverages to start certainly not the Spirit-forward work of a Strip \"Mixologist,\" but at the same time still quite tasty with both the Snow Cone and Tiki drink both the sort of thing that could get lightweights into trouble as the alcohol is well hidden by all the fruit and sweeter stuff.  Continuing to order in threes, a Children's menu affording the ability to taste D&B's famous \"Golden Planks\" in a smaller portion with results par-for-the-course Chicken Strips served with addictive Chipotle Honey Sauce, more interesting bites were found in Grilled Cheese Sticks that saw Manchego put to good use alongside more typical Cheddar and Mozzarella in a golden, crunchy package featuring a gooey center, the Steak n' Cheese Tater Cakes even more impressive as the Hashbrown base was virtually oilless beneath nicely seasoned Beef, Onions and more melted Cheese.  Told that the Burgers were a \"must,\" but also intrigued by Sandwiches as well as some of the Seafood and Chicken choices, suffice it to say that the Maker's Mark BBQ Burger outperforms anything tasted at nearby Shake Shack or Ribs n' Burgers in terms of taste or quality, the 8oz patty grilled perfect medium beneath House-pulled Pork and caramelized Onions, while a delicious half-pound of line-caught Cod fried golden showed an unexpected dedication to sustainable souring, the Short Rib & Cheesy Mac Stack unfortunately falling short of the rest as a result of significant underseasoning.  Not holding back when it comes to desserts, though those dining with small children should be weary that a three-course meal in the middle of a room of flashing lights and temptation will test the patience of even the best behaved boy or girl, there is no doubt a reason that Dave & Buster's Brookie Sundae Tower is featured at the top of the list as three of America's favorite sweets are brought together in a stack of pure decadence, the tender Donut Holes a much lighter way to finish the meal on a sweet note while the Bananas Foster Pie offers a more adult option in a portion better suited for singles.  Taking about an hour to play games after dinner, the range of options each charged a somewhat arbitrary range of \"points\" per play, both adults and children will be challenged by everything from Skee-Ball and Air Hockey to shoot 'em up style games as well as those for which they can win tickets, all-in-all a great way to shake down the food and let the little ones expend some energy at the end of the day.",

When we arrived it took us about 40 minutes before a waitress approached us and then another 30 minutes to get our drinks. We had to flag down another waitress to even get a second drink which took us an hour to get after the first one. Since it took us about two hours to get our drinks, we didn't even have time to play any games before they closed at midnight. To top it off, drinks weren't strong at all and we ended up leaving for a different bar. We definitely will not be returning any time soon.",

    "text": "One star...half a star for my first visit and another half for my second (the following day).  We came on the second day of opening only to be excited for the games and happy hour. It was 9pm on a Tuesday, and of course we expected it to be busy. The lines were long to get a power card, but luckily I had one from a California D&B so we skipped the long lines and *tip* went to the self serve kiosks in the back (super fast service since its do it yourself). The D&Bs have a rep for spotty customer service, but you would think they'd try to improve that with their newly trained employees at a brand new location. WRONG!  The bar was crazy packed and it took forever to get drinks (but they're cheap, 50% off all drinks except for the specialty tea) so I guess it's a win-lose situation. Sean was our bartender and he was pretty awesome. 3 drinks = $14. We played some games throughout the night and got seated right away at 11pm. Our server was nice but told us there was no happy hour on food...when clearly there were signs everywhere stating that select appetizers were 50% off. She didn't refill our waters and barely checked up on us. After the mediocre customer service, the only thing that could save the night was crossy road and piano tiles!!!!!!!!  We knew that Wednesday's were half off all games so we decided to come the next night. This time coming with a larger group of people. Apparently at that point (around 8:30pm) the wait time was 2-3 hours to eat, and the bar was horrific. We stood at the front of the bar since 9pm and didn't get drinks ordered until 9:30pm. (That's how crazy packed it was) and didn't actually receive them until 10pm... Losing quality game time. However, it's understandable because we ordered 10+ drinks. It was only about $50. So worth it!!! Alfred was our bartender and he was pretty great. Tough sport, man! At 9:15pm we decided to just put our name down on the list we got quoted 30 minutes for a party of 12. We were shocked but decided okay, that's not 2-3 hours so why not. As the night went on, we enjoyed playing games but were starting to get hungry. Our pager hadn't gone off and by 10:45pm we finally go seated........hosts need to not under quote large parties. Obviously we were expecting to get seated.   Our server checked our IDs and didn't believe some of them because some were still vertical (not everyone renews their IDs). I know it's a protocol, but when you don't check one that's vertical yet you check the other 3............ Anyway, from that point on we ordered more drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our food came out fairly quickly, but our service was lacking. She stated that we \"all looked the same\" (because we're Asian). And just said weird things servers shouldn't say to customers. As attentive as she was, she wasn't really helpful. We ordered the chocolate fondue dessert and the candle wasn't LIT, therefore the dessert was not LIT/chocolate wasn't heated. The appetizers were 3/5 and the last call for drinks just tasted like they just threw a bunch of alcohol in a cup and they were definitely disgusting. We had yet to receive our bill and we were approached and asked to leave by some other guy who wasn't our server. It was midnight. And we had a bunch of beer left in our beer tower and didn't even get our bills yet. If this is how you treat paying customers who are trying to enjoy your restaurant, then you're definitely going to lose brownie points.   Overall, I wanted to be excited, and I still am for the future, but if they don't change then the only good thing they have going for them is the plethora of games and happy hour drink prices. I know they've only been open for three days and are working out the kinks, but isn't it the time they're supposed to be at the peak of customer service?   They're lucky they only have one competitor that can't really be compared to them.",

I ordered a sirloin steak with mashed potatoes in a lobster sauce with bacon wrapped shrimp. My food was good and I really enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp.....they were very flavorful.  We had a few rounds of drinks and shots, the long beaches were tasty and strong, had green apple shots that were to die for and you could keep the shot glass it came, and the Scooby shot. The Scooby shot was ok, but I enjoyed the other drinks.  My overall experience was good and I plan on returning, the only complaint is the waitress that we had was slow to approach us when we first seated ourselves.",

    "text": "Let's face it.. Dave & Busters is one of those places where even if you receive extremely poor service, you will go back because of the genius concept of games, food, and cheap alcohol, all in one place.  That's exactly what happened here.   Despite the great concept, I had to give this location 3 stars due to the inconsistent service & lack of management. However, I understand it's only been open for 4 days.   Great job on the door-men who open the door and greet you as well as the main helpful \"front desk\" women who held it down with the dozens of lost people in line. Second, Alfred/Alfredo, our bartender was very friendly despite the busyness there was at the one bar. Side note- build a second bar? Third, the hostesses were giving different quote times for my friends & I. When we decided to check in for a table, they quoted us 30 mins. About 55 minutes later, we finally got seated. Next, our server Daisy took care of our party fairly smoothly. The only issue we had was the offensive remark she made in regards to saying all 3 of my male Asian friends look the same. Keep in mind all 3 people had no common features in height, weight, skin tone, hair, smile, eyes, or eyewear. This was after she tried taking my friend's vertical ID to her manager. I'm 23 & also have a vertical ID. Why did she disregard mine? Nevada photo IDs are good for 8 years, therefore if someone receives their license at the age of 16, then of course it'll still be vertical after they turn 21. Lastly, the taller gentleman with the headset who was in charge of the very back table area told us they were closed & we had to go. We got our appetizers, drinks, then dessert before the dinner food, then dinner food, then second round of drinks & then checks before this happened. However, we were still waiting to get our credit card back & finishing up drinks. If you ask me, that's not common courtesy at all. Don't kick someone out when it's your staff that we're waiting for. Maybe if we got sat within the expected time frame, we would've left earlier so your staff could go home.   Thanks Dave & Busters for your great concept & nice venue for Vegas, but please enforce a better system. I hope to give a better updated review in the future.",

The bar area is really huge and the dining area as well. Didn't come here to eat but maybe next time will try their food. I just ordered the Donut bite dessert which was really good. The game choices were limited but I think they are extending it even more.   It's still busy at the moment but sooner or later it will die down. Great area for groups to just hangout and have some fun. Will come back to play more games and buy the $50 for 300 points to play some more my next visit.

Happy hour time most days are 9-closing so alcohol and playing arcade games makes it a lot more fun. Plenty of television screens around the bar area to watch plenty of sports. Right now this is the best place if you are trying to watch the Olympics.  Prices for the games were not that bad. The super charge comes in clutch for an extra few dollars. I bought the best value one which is like $50 something and I've been here a lot already and still have enough points to keep going.

    "text": "This place has gone down-hill. Extremely rude server that shows his negative attitude 100%... rude, rushed and unfriendly. Food comes out wrong and gross. Microwaved and less than mediocre. No one comes to check on you... I've been a member for over 15 years... sloppy and horrible presentation. Asked to speak to a manager. His name is \"Remi\". This \"thug-like\" jerk who could care less comes out and could give zero f***s. \"What else do you want?\" Without an explanation... all the four of us felt very unwelcome and offended... like WHO MADE YOU A MANAGER and WHY ARE YOU A MANAGER IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS???? Both the server and manager were very mean and rude and obviously hates their jobs with a passion like they'd rather be home rather than \"put up\" with what they are paid to do. I felt very unwelcome and offended. Tonight I feel like I want to cash out all of my 190,000 tickets and never come back here. Ghetto to the max. Dave and Buster's you should be ashamed of who you hire here, your employees are miserable and hate their jobs. It's obvious. Both these guys weren't nice at all and were such super mean careless jerks. Shame on you... never again. I WILL CALL corporate if I don't receive a call or response within 48 hours. This experience has been the most horrible, regrettably said. Server's name is Mario. To both of you guys, if you ever come to my place of employment and ever treated you less than half as badly, I hope I'd get fired so I can go home and reevaluate my life and how I should treat customers from that time moving forward. Thank you.",

I went to one in Michigan before, and that one I remember being a little bigger, and I felt like the games were very close together at this location! But overall it was still fun.   I was sent a coupon by downtown Summerlin where I got $20 free game play with $20 game play purchase. I literally spent all my time at the Star Wars game!   It's addicting! There were a few other games I played too but this one I got almost my entire party hooked!",

I've been here 2 times in the past week and there service is all around DISORGANIZED! It took 25 min for someone just to come and get our drink orders! Seriously...after getting our drinks another 20 min for someone to come and order our food. I don't understand why they would have a whole section open to just ONE server?! Especially when you know Happy Hour is gonna be busy. I recommend anyone coming to find somewhere else to eat because you'll be spending half your time here waiting for someone to help you.",

There weren't many fun games. The prize room was disappointing. Not many options for toys in all ranges. They also didn't give me back my daughters card which still had 200 tickets on it. So I was walking around the prize room trying to find it and they did not acknowledge this at all even though it was at their desk until I came up to them and let them know I couldn't find it. Gameworks at Townsquare is definitely better.",

Second time was to watch a basketball game and it was perfect because the bar area was not crowded at all, plenty of TVs to watch the game and the bartenders were great. Their personalities and fast attentive service deserved 5 stars. I would possibly come back to watch another game in the future.  The third time, we had dinner and wanted to stay and play some games after. The food was horrible and that's all I have to say about that. So much that we didn't even stay to play games afterwards because I was so disappointed with the food that it ruined my mood and I just wanted to go home.   Come for the games and maybe some drinks but don't bother with the food trust me",

    "text": "First timer, last time! Went in with my 2 boys 6 and 7. Also had my 7 month old but for this review we will leave her out. Went in sat down to eat first. It was about 12 so lunch time. Fairly empty with plenty of staff. By no means slow but not busy either. We sat in a booth by the bar. We ordered our drinks and took a look at the menu. Ok it was pricey, but hey if it's good who cares. Kid 1 got Mac and cheeses, it was zero special, infant it was straight up kraft out of the box. Which could have been ok but of course it was mass produced back in the kitchen and stored to be reheated when a little freckle walked in an ordered it. Kid 2 who we will for the record will say would eat the gum off the bottom of the table and not complain ordered the chicken fingers. He took a bite and then another and said these are NO GOOD. 2 words I have never heard come from his mouth when eating. Of course I was worried and tried them. He was right NO GOOD. Cooked multiple times or stored under a heat lamp they were dry and rubbery. Like a fried piece  of elastic. I ordered the Mac and cheese and possibly pot roast sandwich. It was beautifully displayed. The meat was well done and dry, not quite as over cooked as the chicken from above but non the less it reminded me of silly putty. I drowned it in good old hienz 57 and got it down. The tater tots? They were Excellent. As a matter of fact we all enjoyed them, including the 7 month old who we didn't include in this post. The wait staff was a whole other situation. Very fake but at least pretended to care. You could tell they were aware a lot of people were unhappy and had zero control over the situation. They ( about 6 or7) hung out by the bar and laughed and joked. I can only think they were laughing at us for being there. The bill for the food 44.00 I left a few bucks for a tip only because I was obligated, I wish I could be one of those people that just walked but I couldn't do it. Again part of me believes it's not there fault anyway. Ok game time. We buy 23.00 worth of tokens. They charge me 2.00 to do so. An initiation I suppose to be a proud owner of a plastic card I have 1000s of from local casinos. I suppose in other states this crap flies as cool in this one at least to me it's more crap laying around I have to deal with it. Anyway. Games were all working. Which is a plus for a place like this. Some were pricey actually most were. But my kids had an hour of fun for 25.00. Not much to complain about in this department. If this was a game room trip I'd give them 2 stars it was not the best I've seen. It was over priced. Too much 1 ball games for tickets. You know the ones that cost the most and last the least amount of time. As if they are giving you good prizes for these tickets. Nope we walked threw just junk. With the 240 or so tickets on the card I left them there instead of wasting my time explaining to my kids that anything worth wolf is 6000 plus tickets. Which you can buy in a store for 10.00 or win here for 1000.00........ maybe. Still I was a kid once and understand the excitement.",

    "text": "I've gone to many Dave & Buster's in california and fell in love with the business because of the fun atmosphere, the great drinks, and the games that they all carried... But I am sadly to say that this Dave & Buster's will need to do a lot of work with their management and service regarding their restaurant. Me and group of friends had arrived at DnB around 8:45 PM excited to check out the new Las Vegas location. Going into the bar we had ordered 10+ drinks from our bartender named Albert which took roughly about 20 to 30 minutes to get all of our drinks, but I totally understand that it was a busy day for them since it was their first \"half off games\" day, along with their drink and food happy hour. The drinks were great tasting and didn't feel like there was too much alcohol or too little alcohol in which I appreciate our bartenders service because he did try his best to accommodate to us and everyone else around us.   Now around I would say 9:30 PM, we were thinking about whether or not we should get a table to eat at their restaurant because one other friend had told us that there would be a 2 to 3 hour wait for a table. But instead we went ahead and gave it a try just because we were pretty hungry and see if anything changed. We were quoted that we would get a tablet at about 25 to 30 minutes in which we were cool about because it gave us some time to go play some games and hangout a little before getting sat and try their food... It took them an hour and a half to get us a table, in which we had to check in with the host stand a couple times before getting a definite answer on what was going on.   Now going into dinner our server greeted us with a welcoming greeting and offered us to take our appetizer order and drink order. Luckily we had made it during their appetizer happy hour. Upon taking our appetizer order our server had taken our drink order also. We asked for a beer tower and a few cocktails that we really liked from when we had ordered from the bar when we first came in along with a few other cocktails we wanted to try. Our server had asked for our ID's in which we all handed our drivers license to her. Now all of my friends that had shown their ID's were clearly over the age of 21 especially me. She then had told us that she would have to have her manager check our Drivers license to her. Now in Nevada, if you had acquired your drivers license before the age of 18 you would have a vertical license. On the day you turn 21 is when you would have to renew your drivers license in which you would have to go in a few days early just before the expiration date so that you wouldn't be driving with an expired drivers license. There were 3 vertical license that we had given to her in which the manager themselves came out to our tablet and had to look at us, NOT THE PRINTED DRIVERS LICENSE DATE OF BIRTH ON OUR LICENSE, but just looked at us. After the servers manager gave her the \"okay\" to serve us alcohol. Upon returning our ID's our server was having a hard time figuring out which person was which in which she had almost given the wrong ID to the wrong person and made a remark in which I quote, \" You guys all look the same.\" Now as a customer I have never had anyone make that kind remark about me or my friends just because we are all Asian American in which i had found offensive because not one of us had looked alike what so ever.   Moving onto finishing up our meal and just enjoying everyone's company it was just about 12 o'clock and we had just gotten our checks, but we still had a few alcoholic drinks and had just about 20 more ounces of beer left in the beer tower we had ordered. A large man, who had dreads, wearing a purple shirt under a black sweater vest and glasses told us that they are now closed and that we had to go. In which I had found very rude and inconsiderate with the fact that we were still waiting on the checks with our credit cards in. What had also bothered me was that we were still finishing up our alcohol that we had ordered and the fact that there was another party in a separate room hanging out still and was not told whatsoever that they had to leave by my presumption because I was within view of that separate room perfectly fine. Now I understand that you guys are closed, but you DO NOT tell your paying customers to leave. If he had told us that before we even got our checks or anyone else in that matter, anyone could of just dine and dashed because they had told us to \"We are closed now, so I have to ask you to leave.\" We didn't even get to finish our alcohol because of him. By no means should a restaurant do that under any circumstances unless it is an emergency, which I believe there was no emergency at all.   Sorry D&B but you guys have a lot of work to do with your management team in the restaurant. I don't know how you can tell paying customers to get out just because you closed.",

Some of the games  when swiping the card said card accepted and enjoy but then immediately said card error which then we had to swipe again and wasted credits?!!  The place is SMALL not much gaming or dining area like Hawaii.  I was expecting Vegas to be better than Hawaii, but I guess not.... it didn't wow any of us nor do we look forward to coming back.

To my disappointment, this location is terrible. 1. They've hired the youngest, cheapest and most inexperienced staff and CLEARLY did not invest in their training.  2. The food is at best, mediocre.  3. Don't even THINK about hosting an event here because NO ONE will call you back or return your phone calls.  4. The venue is nice; but, tiny.  The only good thing about this place is Happy Hour Mon-Fri.  They have got to step their game up and train their managers and associates. It's not looking too good for this location.  I'm so disappointed. UPDATE: I have to give credit where credit is due. I finally got ahold of the original person that I spoke to about hosting an event, Ashlynne. She is AWESOME! She held on the phone with me while she made a contract and made sure that I received the contracted just in case I had any questions or concerns. D&B almost lost my business. Ashlynne saved it and I appreciate her help. I hope that she at least gets recognized for this.",

The whole place???  So they gave us a card worth like $20 or something for game play and we left.  A restaurant on our way home was happy to take our money minus the games. Will we return?

    "text": "I love the arcade games that Dave & Busters have, my first time being at the California locations. Knowing that one in Summerlin opened up, I was really excited to finally be able to go to D&B without having to vacay to Cali. The main reason why I am giving them a 1 star is because of their customer service, the main priority an establishment like this place should focus on.  My first night being at this location, I was really pumped! Drinks, food and arcade games. Where can you go wrong? Turns out, I was. The bar was straight up packed during happy hour (9pm-closing), and it took a while to get our drink orders in AND to get the drinks, roughly about 30 mins. But the bartender, Sean, was able to tend to multiple customers, including a small party of three of me and my two friends while everyone was shouting at him to get some drink orders in. Way to stay calm and cool, Sean. Four for you, Glenn Coco. After playing a couple of games and got some drinks, we decided to put our name on the waiting list for the restaurant to grab a small bite to eat before heading back on the floor. I don't remember our server's name but she was friendly. The only problem was she didn't know anything that was on happy hour and that there were certain appetizers that were on happy hour when we asked her these questions. That's something a server should definitely know to further better your guests experience. The food came at a timely manner. We ordered the sliders wings and fries appetizer platter and the nachos along with their $2 tacos but the food was ehhh. But it filled our stomachs up. After eating, we went back out on the floor and over the intercom, they give a shout saying its last call for games. Literally, it was last call. The minute it turns midnight, they shut them boys off like they lost electricity in the building. Had fun but the employees didn't make anything better except for our boy Sean.  Second night we came in, we came with a bigger party of roughly about 8 or 9 of us. It was a Wednesday and on Wednesdays, it's half price on the games the entire day. Half prices on games drinks and food? Yessir. So shout outs for that but whoever wants to come this day, prepare for it to be busy. We got to the bar roughly around 9pm exact just to get that happy hour price. Another bartender, Alfred, was up for the challenge.  It took him a while to get to us because of everyone constantly shouting drink orders. The time was now 930pm when he did get to us. We ordered roughly about 10+ drinks and it only came to about 50 bucks. That's deals. But the drinks did take another 15 minutes for them to reach us. So we lost 45 mins of playing time. We also decided to put our name on the waiting list because we wanted to get some food again, this time trying out different items and getting that happy hour pricing. They quoted our party about 20-30 mins. We were shocked that it was quoted so little, being a party of 9 and with how busy the entire D&B was. Every table was taken. So we were skeptical. Guess what? We were right. It took 2+ hours to finally get us a table AFTER checking in every 30 mins on the status for our table. So we couldn't even really get to enjoy playing games since we were expecting to be called soon and end up being seated at roughly 11pm. We were seated and our server was Daisy. For the most part, she was very friendly and nice. Wasn't overwhelmed with our party and was really calm when we placed our orders, having split checks and everything. When we ordered drinks from her though, she had to check our IDs. Normal protocol. But two of our friends had vertical IDs, one of them being a 23 year old and the other, freshly turned 21 for a couple weeks. She must of thought his ID was fake as Daisy had to double check with a manager to make sure the ID was legit because it was vertical. Hrmmmm. That's not right. Why not take both IDs then? Not just one. And in addition to that, when she took another 3 of our friends IDs, she said \" I don't know which one of you guys is which, you guys all look the same.\" Yes, we are all Asian. BUT NONE OF US LOOKED THE SAME ONE BIT. No relation to each other at all! And she came to me with the 3 IDs and was looking at all 3 of them while looking at me to see if I was one of the IDs. She didn't even take my ID. She checked it earlier and didn't take mine away. Fishy to me. Food came out and we were last called it being around 1130-1145 ish. Wouldn't have happened if we'd known we'd be seated so late. To top the night off, another employee who may have been the manager told us, \"I know you guys are having fun but unfortunately, we are closed and you guys have to leave.\" We didn't even finish our drinks and they were all full. AND when we got them so late. AND we didn't even get our cards back from paying the bill. Time for us to leave.   D&B. Please change your definition of great quality customer service.",

    "text": "We went to Dave N Busters on a late Saturday afternoon to meet some people from out of town to watch some college football. Having been to other locations in California, I knew they had a large bar area with multiple TVs to watch different games going on that afternoon. While DNB's did have a lovely bar scene with lots of TVs and action going on, their service left something to be desired.  Once getting a seat right away in the bar area, we were greeted by the first waitress. In all fairness, she did state that they were in the middle of a shift change and another waitress would probably be helping us towards the end of our meal. The first waitress was great, got our drinks quickly and when the rest of our party arrived, got theirs as well. We also ordered an appetizer (cheese and spinach dip)  with the first waitress that was delivered piping hot and quite fast.  The second waitress was another story. She took our dinner order with no pen or pad, which was concerning just because she asked us to repeat several times and recited our order back wrong to begin with. We ordered another round of drinks with our dinner order. Then.... Nothing! She must have gotten busy or overwhelmed, but a set of waiters tried to deliver our food and our guests got their food, but they didn't have ours (actually, we later found out she put another table's order under ours and it just so happened the first two items were the same as our guest ordered).  We still had not received our drinks and we had 2 beers and a margarita. She came to the table and started blaming the kitchen and the bar for being busy when other tables around us were fine. At this point we were still waiting over 30 minutes for the rest of our food and our drinks. A manager came and asked where our food was, when we told him we hadn't received it, he seemed upset and went to find out what happened. He kept asking if we ordered together or separate and we told him we ordered together. He brought out some of the food we ordered, but forgot our drinks and basket of chips we had ordered with our dinner (and at the same time). The waitress came back after with 2 of our beers and then made some excuse why we were still waiting for our maragarita. We literally waited yet another 10 minutes after all that time to get the margarita, which was delivered by someone else. A little bit after, our waitress came with another margarita and said they made an extra so he could have it. It was just really bad. Still no chips. We would have ordered at least another round and some more wings, which was the intention, but it was such a mess, we decided to leave at half time and go somewhere else. We still spent well over $150 for the 4 of us.  I understand this place is new, but the difference in service from the first to second waitress was night and day. With all the noise and commotion going on in this place, I'm sure it's hard to concentrate all the time. My suggestion would be to make sure the staff writes down their order and are tested on the menu and table numbers to avoid these types of situations. Also, there were quite a few managers that circled this place, but none were really touching the tables to make sure everything was ok. The one that did visit our table was only concerned with getting out one of the multiple items we were missing and never came and checked again.  It's also a True annoyance when a server blames everyone else but themselves to take responsibility for a mistake. Everyone gets behind, but when you're at our table being very unprofessional speaking about a bar that is obviously getting everyone else's drink out (we were right in front of the bar and multiple people were in and out of there while we waited and waited) and kitchen that is able to make every other table's food, maybe it's time to take responsibility and at least I would have more respect for your troubles.",

Instead, he handed to those girls sitting next to us even though one of them TOLD him straight they didn't order that. But he said it's ok to those girl until we help him out by saying it's ours. I found its funny because if food was brought out. you know it has to be someone on this bar ordered it. Right?

    "text": "I came here for my son's birthday today and the customer service was terrible. I've never experienced such bad customer service in a restaurant before. First off, I asked the lady in the front where and how I could get seats for a party of 10 and she told me to go to the back and someone would help me. I eventually walked towards the back but there was not a designated spot for someone to help. I literally walked around looking confused while I walked by a group of at least 10 workers all in a corner just talking with each other and not even looking like they were working. I even passed by maybe another 10 workers who didn't even offer any help until I had to finally go up and ask someone. She basically told me that it's a find your own seat type of restaurant. So I look around to find any open tables but it was pretty full. I walked pass by a bar area and didn't realize there was a sign that said employees only. One of the staff members was extremely rude about how she told me not to pass by there. She didn't have to be that rude. I waited by a seating area with our party and it felt like I waited there almost 45 min minutes for a table for 10 to open up. The way the seating was done was ridiculous because there were people in big booth tables that could fit 10 that only sat 2-3 people. When I finally did find a booth for our party, another individual who was a party of 2 took the large booth when they literally just walked in maybe 5 min ago while I had been waiting for 45 min. I was soooo upset with the way this place seats their customers.  It's disorganized and makes people upset. My kids were starving by that point, the staff was rude, and the place had the worst customer service ever. We ended up leaving the place to eat somewhere else. I only gave this place one star because we came back only to play the games. If there was an option of giving half a star, I would have given that. Overall, a bad experience.",

He thoroughly explained how everything works, like the combo which includes a meal and game playing card, the best games to play, etc. He was attentive without hovering, and he was super fun and happy.

    "text": "This place was absolutely AMAZING! We were unaware of the fights that night and we planned a birthday party for about 30 guests in hopes that we arrived an hour early and they would accommodate us. Absolutely they did even with it being fight night! We were originally told an hour and a half but they just do happen to have a big group of tables open up at the same time and they were going to give us that area and even held it for us until most of our guests arrived. Totally not what I was expecting that's for sure. They were so wonderful and so accommodating, the food was delicious as always.   We understood why they were charging for the fight as its very open concept and anywhere you go in there you can see a tv so how are they supposed to accommodate people who are only there for \"games and a bite.\"  Besides that you got the money back on a game card that played the arcade games you just couldn't win any tickets with the cards. Believe me when I say when that fight was on, the entire place stood still watching it so of course they were charging to get in. They pay a lot of money to show those fights and they have to get something in return. It's a business for Christ's sake. Yes it's loud but it's an ARCADE/SPORTS BAR! It's not an effing library people! Man!   I believe Dave and Busters handled our situation extremely well and the service was amazing. The manager was also awesome.   And no, I don't work for them I just had an absolutely amazing experience.",

    "text": "This is a tough place to rate because the restaurant gets 3 stars from me but the arcade area is (obviously) the best part.  This is a good place to bring a group but I wouldn't want to come here to spend quality time with someone. The restaurant is a large area which is good and you don't have to wait terribly long, even if you have a large party in most cases.   The menu is ridiculous in the sense that everything is super over the top. You get good things and bad things from that. I ordered a turkey burger thinking that- by the looks of their other burgers, it would be one to remember. It was just \"meh\" and honestly something I could have made at home. I would have rather gone with something more ridiculous like a Mac and cheese burger or whatever it was they had.   My suggestion: go with something that is pictured on the menu. (Turkey burger was not.)  The drink selection is more focused on crazy drinks like a sno cone with an upside down Corona in it and something that glows in the dark and has been blessed by a unicorn. The wine selection was slim so this is more of a place where I would stick with beer.  The service was overall an 8/10 because it wasn't awe inspiring but you have to hand it to them because they are servicing so many people!  As for the games: my husband and I spent the $29 for 170 play points (I might be a little off on the points but I'm right about the price) and that was a perfect amount for us to play. There's a bunch of games that give you ticket rewards and a bunch that don't, which you don't know until you're done.",

Your game money is loaded onto a card as well as the tickets you've won. Not allot of extra stuff to keep up with. I like the card idea. I traded in my tickets earned on 2 bracelets.

The manager took care of my bill and apologize. Because of his professionalism. I will return. He is great at what he do! Now the games D&B have are awesome.

The prices are wayyyy too high for the awful food, which was served cold, was not tasty and we were sick all the next day.  Speaking of prices, the drink menu has no prices listed just to give you an idea of how ridiculous the prices are.  Surely they are making more than enough on the games alone.

Everyone did enjoy *Salad station, Dinner Rolls, Sweet and Spicy Meatballs & roasted potatoes   I was there on time to taste the food. A couple of people were late and it being in those warmers, made the food dry up vs keeping it warm.   The server was great!!! She did an amazing job!!! Was very on top of everything. One of our co-worker did complain about the food and the manager offered her to order anything on the menu and he will take care of it but she didn't want to order anything because she knew everyone else at the event would have done the same.  This was everyone's first time at this new Dave & Buster's in Las Vegas. It was very small compare to the ones we've held events at in California. A lot of ticket games and not enough video games. The unlimited card was not very useful.   OVER ALL We spent $1,203.78 for 13 people.  So about $92.59 per person. This was not worth what we spent. Not to mention we paid $75 for them to black an area off in their restaurant. We went on a Thursday night and it was dead. You are better off planning an event and having everyone order their own food and drinks. You will save more.",

    "text": "I don't write negative reviews, but this is absolutely ridiculous. I was a regular until the manager (tall, Caucasian, male) didn't know how to do his job. I was playing on a machine where you try to collect cards to earn points. This machine has 2 spots for players. I was only playing on ONE spot while another person kept watching me, IGNORING THE OTHER FREE SPOT. I spent a decent amount of time and money and played until a rare card came out and I wanted to collect it before moving on to collect points, which is AWAY FROM THE MACHINE. Unfortunately I needed to recharge but no one could watch my spot. I even nicely asked the person watching me and he specifically said, \"No. I want to play at YOUR spot.\" So I asked an employee for help and they said I could recharge online. I come here so much and people save their spots all the time for the card game machines when they need to recharge because they already spent a lot of time and money to get what they want and they don't want other people to leech off their hard work, and every sane, reasonable person understands this courtesy: don't steal other people's spots until they're done because they were there first. This person complained to the manager and overexaggerated the amount of time I spent playing at this one spot out of two spots, ignoring the other free spot because he wanted to leech off my work, time, and money. The manager asked me to \"step aside\" because I was at the \"one spot\" for \"too long\" and could not recharge at the same spot I was playing at. How infuriating. This manager likes to side with unreasonable complaints from customers without finding out the truth to help the customer who actually needed help. This was a place to have fun and to relieve stress and I come here, pay you money, and then have this inexperienced and unreasonable manager help stupid customers leech off my work, time, and money. I'm never coming back.  I'd love to see this manager \"step aside\" and have a reasonable person take his position.",

The cheese curds were cold, the lettuce wraps were decent but not the best, lettuce was limp, not crispy as a lettuce wrap should be. The alcoholic beverage tasted like a Capri sun, I'm not a drinker so I should have been able to at least taste some sort of alcohol in it. Don't even get me started on the dessert....the brownies and cookies were so stale they tasted like Costco \"toss outs\" that they get for free out of the dumpster! The ice cream was freezer burned. For the price I paid (damn near $55.00) for all of this disgusting food and dessert I was totally disappointed. Needless to say, I will never again return definitely not worth the drive and waste of money. I should have complained right there but I didn't want to cause a scene at a birthday party. I hope this review helps many from experiencing what I experienced.",

    "text": "Food was great - lots of selection.  Happy hour menu wasn't worth it, it's just a mini/single individual portion (like tapas), it was tasty though.  We ordered one of each - tacos, shrimp, sliders, bang bang chicken, etc.  I would only order the chicken, tacos and the artichoke dip again, the rest I would order from the regular menu.  Drinks were great - happy hour 1/2 off cocktails.  It was Monday night football so they had the game on the many large screens they have. It was viewable from any location.  It was self-seating, so hard for the server to determine who was already seated and who just sat. As a result, I sat for awhile before finally flagging down a server.  That could use improvement.  Once getting service, he did his best to provide great service. I don't think it was him but it was slow between when he could help us.    The powercard and all the different offers became confusing - from the online sign-up offer, to the food/card combo, to credits from purchasing food, to getting a card... I finally figured it out with the help of a few other customers and the information desk.  The game play area is dark and a bit noisy (could be with age that it bugs me now).  My daughter loved it - an upgrade from Chuck E Cheese, but way more expensive.  I would recommend going on Wednesdays when games are 1/2 off. They get you since you buy credits and games cost credits instead of $$ so you don't realize the game could be $1.75 to play.",

Let's begin with the food; the burger was well proportioned the fries were very tasty and seasoned well, however a lot of the food was very bland. The adult tasty beverages were well priced and tasty, feel free to enjoy a couple of them on happy hour. Second, the entertainment. This establishment is really geared for kids and young teens. It is full of video arcade games some of the games will give you tokens someone I'm not. It is extremely noisy and many of the games to play are very expensive. I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the virtual reality ride with the dinosaurs. Sadly it was very expensive at five dollars a person for less than two minutes of entertainment. Over all, I would do this experience again. I don't suggest doing it at 5 PM at the height of dinner perhaps a little later if you were going with adults and perhaps a little earlier if you're going with small children.",

Maybe it was our bad for not making a reservation earlier but there was seven people in our party and we waited about 45 mins before getting a table. They seemed to be busy but not that slammed to not be able to seat us, but at least we got to enjoy some drinks at the bar beforehand.   Drink wise this place rocks. They have happy hour 4-7 with half off all cocktails and bud lights for $2. I tried the watermelon margarita and mango margarita. I liked the styling and playfulness of the watermelon one, but the mango tasted much better in my opinion. Can't beat the prices of around $5 per drink though.  Now for food, my bae and I decided to share the sliders and wings app. I honestly was not impressed at all with this. The wings tasted frozen and the sliders were pretty bland. Definitely a disappointment.   Overall I think D&B is great for drinks and games, but not so much the food. I'd be back again, but only for late night shenanigans.",

We asked one of the guys who brought us our food for ranch sauce and we had to flag him down before he even stopped. And guess what? He never brought it and walked by us multiple times without even a second look. Had no utensils upon sitting down and didn't get any until well after the food got there. The lettuce wrap was amazing. But sadly, we won't be making a return.  I had to update my review, after waiting 30 minutes for a check, the waitress just put it on the table and walked away. Waited another 10 minutes for waitress to pick up the check so we could sign and play. She didn't, someone else did. Yet, we still tipped because both parties involved work in the customer service industry. We each had cards with over 150 points on it. We went to play a new VR Jurassic park game to which the \"attendant\" at the game rolled her eyes and seemed extremely inconvenienced by us. We had to purchase certain tickets for this game at the front desk. We went and again the person at the front desk literally told the other attendant \"they forced her to put the game on.\" Literally took all the fun out of it. We played a bunch of other games but called it quits once the card reader kept detecting an error and had us slide our card 6/7 times before accepting it.   Extremely disappointing as we were planning on having our corporate Christmas lunch there which we will be planning to have it elsewhere after such lackluster service. For being the only D&B in Vegas, you guys are giving it a bad name.",

But not too busy where we could quickly sit at the bar for some drinks.  It was happy hour to $1 off wines and draft beers. Also half off liquor! Chachiiiiiiing*****  I wasn't hungry but ordered wine and the roomies ordered draft beers. The beers came in big glasses and I swear there were 10 bartenders at the bar! lol at least 2 different bartenders were asking us if we needed help.  Although we didn't eat, the BBQ ribs the guy next to us was eating smelled hella bomb.   There were numerous, and I DO MEAN NUMEROUS --- maybe 8 to be exact --- tvs at the bar, along with on the restaurant walls. Almost felt like I was at a sports book. We watched a few rounds of Olympics water polo matches before playing some games.   I got an email from DT Summerlin for their opening earlier in the day which gave a coupon for $20 worth of gaming with $20 card purchase.  We redeemed that and paid an extra $2 for the card itself.  All the workers are still learning so that whole card purchase took some time.  She also mentioned for an extra $6, we could get 50 extra chips/play in our card -- ok, sure; why not.   All in all the boys played few rounds of basketball, skeeball, and air hockey. There were so much of each game that the wait, if any, wasn't too long.   Excited to have D&Bs here and can't wait to try the food next time.",

They have just about everything you can imagine including 21st century versions of classic 20th century games. For example giant Pac Man and a large modern version of Galaga, one of my all time favorites.  This place is extremely loud!  Sensory overload on the eardrums. With all the chatter of the patrons as well as all the sounds of the video machines the decibel level can compare to a concert venue.  We did not get to eat because we werr quoted a nearly 2 hour wait to get a table. I DON'T THINK SO! We made the reservation anyways but went somewhere else in DT Summerlin instead.  Our buzzer went off after about 45 minutes because I am sure everyone else said screw this wait. I did browse the menu and vegetarians beware there is not much for you to enjoy besides salad minus the meat or portobello mushroom burgers. The prices also seemed very $$ to $$$.   We had fun overall but the place was at capacity for a Friday night and at times a line for some games. With that amount of people I could see trouble brewing here very easily. This place needs some real security staff to make sure these problems don't arise and if they do, can be handled quickly.    Ahh my ears feel better now that it's quiet.",

He already picked his aqua man car and little piggie for his baby sister but the card with 1,350 credits was lost. I lost hope and a perfect day was about to turn to an educational experience on responsibility.... I said I'll try my chances at the front desk, maybe they could recover my card.

    "text": "The food is not exciting at all. Basic flavors and well over priced. I mean it could have been a better dining opportunity but I guess they think the games equals things. So I ordered the gold fingers, they weren't seasoned or anything just basic battered chicken, I ordered them buffalo style. The sauce was okay but no kick no extra heat. The fries were hot and fresh which was a bonus, then I ordered the churros,  the ice cream was SPECTACULAR. The churros were just okay. The filling was waaaaaay too overpowering. There was barely even and sugar and cinnamon on them. I like the sides that came with your ice cream. The Oreo cookies in the ice cream was splendid!!!  My boyfriend didn't even finish his goldfingers. He said they were dry(mind you he got the plain goldfingers not dipped in buffalo sauce). Which was the truth. His were on the drier side. The fries he got were good. The tater tots he ordered were fresh and delicious. I took his chicken to go( because I don't like being wasteful). Let me tell you I ate them the next day and they were worse. I don't know why they smelled weird and had a funny taste. Definitely learn my lesson. Just go for the games because all that was 85$.  The waitress was great and the games are fun.",

    "text": "Severely disappointed after my most recent visit with friends. I've usually had positive/ neutral experiences, but this was unusually unprofessional behavior/ conduct. To begin, it was disappointing when people who came to the bar AFTER us were served with their beverages substantially before us while we had been waiting and were blatantly ignored (age discrimination?). Additionally closing out our tab, we were double charged for the drinks, first as separate drinks listed than as the entire drink tally in total!! Not to mention our drink order was wrong 2x!! {this may be understandable if they were busy, but unfortunately it was just a result of carelessness and lack of enthusiasm from the bartenders} Furthermore... there was a very RUDE/ harassing crew member who snidely mocked us taking photos and proceeded to stare us down until we felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave.  The drinks were as expected and the half price game Wednesday's is always a great deal But after this experience it'll probably be some time until we return when D&B decides to better invest in employee conduct and service.",

It's cool to come and spend $10 - $20 on arcade games to pass some time with friends. Not something to do all the time, as it could get old quick. The prizes aren't anything crazy cool or out of the ordinary from your usual upscale arcade, and for the amount of money you need to spend to win the amount of tickets for the large prizes is absurd, of course that goes without say though. They have to make money somehow.  The food is delicious! Absolutely! Though it is quite expensive for some higher-end-like bar food. The specialty alcoholic beverages are pretty cool, too, though again... the cost isn't something that's at all appetizing.  Over-hyped. Still fun.",

We decided to give the company another shot and are much more pleased with this location.   Perhaps it's because of the recent opening and no one hates their job yet, but the vibe upon entrance is light and happy. Everyone seemed happy to be at work and we were greeted with smiles from multiple employees.    Before playing the games, we decided to grab a bite to eat. There was no wait and our server came over immediately. (Save yourself the trouble and seat yourself -- they're not very good about letting you know that there is no need to wait for a host). The menu can be a little pricey, but items generally range from $12-$19. We got some burgers, the mac&cheese, and chicken alfredo. One of my friends got a sangria which was awesome -- and I'm not a fan of tequila. Everyone said their food was delicious as well. The portions are good for the price you pay.   As for the games, there are TONS to choose from. They can get expensive fast, but this is typical nowadays. We spent about $25 each and got to play most of the games we wanted to. As usual, the rewards leave much to be desired, but that's not the reason you come to D&B's, is it?   All in all, we will return. Our server was very attentive and quick to get us whatever we needed.",

    "text": "My first time and it was so much fun! Family oriented placed and after a certain time it's definitely a place to drink and play. You'll need to get a card and load chips they have a selection for you to choose from. There was a lot of us so I took advantage of the 4 party pack. Once you have your card which they charge a $2 activation fee, you can so straight to playing! Make sure to keep your card to avoid future activation fee that you will be charge with for a new card. So may fun games for more than just 2 people than what you're normally used too.  If you're interested in eating because we did go on a Friday night be prepared to wait for hours, but you can always let time fly by playing and trust me it goes by quick. The food was good, although my man didn't really enjoy his chicken fingers, he liked the bone out chicken more. The French fries wasn't that great though so I don't recommend them. I haven't tried much besides the nachos and spinach Artichoke appetizers but they were great! I really like our server Analuisa I think was her name, not sure if I spelled it right. She was so sweet, friendly and accommodating. She said that they don't do anything special for birthdays and don't have candles for the dessert but she was able to find some and light it too! She really went out of her way to make our night special!  We will definitely come back here for more fun and supercharge our cards!!!",

Server started to be nice half way through the meal, but the food runner basically shoved random plates at me and said \"I don't know where they go, I'm just dropping them off\".

They've purchased UFC fight and are charging everyone a minimum to enter -  regardless whether you're watching or not... $10/each  I'm not here for the fight but they tell me not to worry cause we'll give credits to play games at the same value - im thinking that's fine - was gonna play games anyway, why not.  Learned real quick you can use these credits for only maybe 5 of the games offered??  I tried to talk to manager about it - not there for the fight but games and dinner - it's Dave & Busters not Sapphire!  I was told he can't help. Period.  - Can't play games I want with that card - Can't issue refund cause I played one game already - mind you, I didn't even ask for a refund. - Can't apply money to another card that can be used for other games - even if I add another $50 to the \"right\" card.  Why not? What's the difference what games I play - I gave you the cash?  Apparently it's not the minimum to play games, It's COVER for the UFC fight! NOT WATCHING UFC - Who cares! You're paying the cover.  What a SCAM!!!  Super disappointed with manipulation & with the service, especially the ignorance on manager's part.   Would give 0 stars if I could.

Both of us got severe food poisoning and we know it was from that because we hadn't really ate that day. The games were fun but the overall experience was mediocre.",

    "text": "I went for weekday happy hour yesterday  which is from  4:30pm to 7:00pm Monday  to  Thursday. Online the menu boasted 1/2 price appetizers, cocktails, draft, etc. I was excited. I got there earlier than the rest of my  party so I decided to  look at the happy hour menu to  see what my  options were specifically, but there wasn't a \"happy hour menu\". I had to  ask the server what  drinks I was able to  order that  would be the half price for happy hour. She basically told me that  it was all of them except the ones with the souvenir cups, Sweet!  I waited a while for my  friends and then wanted to  order food. Again, I would have to  ask. I felt awkward doing this again , so  i just assumed that  it was all of the appetizers except the platters (thats how it  is most places). I ordered buffalo wings and nachos. My  friends get  there and they  ask her to point out which appetizers are the  happy hour ones and to my surprise she only names 3 of the  like 8 or so and none were the ones that  I ordered. Go figure... I only  recall 2 of the 3 happy  hour apps and that  was the quesadilla and the boneless buffalo wings.   The food was good and the drinks during this time were a steal. I paid about $9 for my  two  cocktails. Winning! The food I paid a lot more. My  total  bill for the 2 drinks that  were half off, nachos, and an order of wings was about $35. Ouch and we hadn't even played  games yet lol. Overall I would go  back for happy hour again although probably just for drinks as having only 3 options of a vast food menu wasn't that much of a deal.",

We asked the cashier if there were any specials and the cashier was rude and only focused on the game cards. So we purchased three $29 cards for our kids and let them go. As we met our baseball team at the table, our friends told us about the food/ game card combo (includes unlimited games and a meal for $4 leas than what we paid per card for just 170 credits worth of games). Long story shortened, Jillian the manager refunded our original cards even tho our kids spent some of the credits, and then set us up with with 3 of the game/ food combos. She was very professional and apologetic that the original cashier was rude and did not offer the combo even tho we had asked. What started off as a 2 star review ended with a 5. A great deal for $26 to get a meal and unlimited play after first 120 credits are depleted. The second cashier we spoke with was very helpful as well. Thanks again Jillian!",

I asked for the manager on duty that night when the person up front rejected my request for a veteran discount (I had my state issued NV drivers license which stated this as proof). She was not rude but did insist that it must be a military issued id card, per policy. When the manager arrived I explained to them that not all veterans carry their military ids when they get out. I have my DD214, I have my license, I'm good. The state id confirms our status. To my surprise, the manager also insisted on their policy and denied me and the other veterans in our group the discount we otherwise would have gotten. It would have amounted to $2.00 off for each of us, such a small amount to not only avoid this negative experience but earn some goodwill from the veteran community. I personally make it a point to support a business that shows appreciation for veterans and was happily surprised to see the notice at Dave and Busters's area up front. Talk about half commitment! Were it not for the other non-veterans in our group that night, We would not have given Dave and Busters any of our business. Moving forward, I will be sure to avoid them.",

Surprisingly there was a booth open in the open seating area, I've been to many fights and it's usually a full house so I was stoked. I was immediately greeted by Schyler, he was awesome. Made sure I was all good until the rest of my party came and greeted and helped them the exact same way. Never did I once have to look around and find him. He was very attentive and he had multiple tables. This is top notch service. I hope when I go back next time Schyler helps us out again. Although everyone else was also very nice. This is definitely a change from going to BWW where you don't get even CLOSE to the same service. So again, thank you Schyler, we will be returning for the next one! :).",

The bar is pretty fun with lots of tv screens and friendly bartenders. The bar has good drinks, and I should say that you can take your drinks to the arcade! Now, let's talk about the restaurant. Since one of my family members had a birthday at the restaurant, I can do a good review. The food was great and yummy, and the service is okay. Finally, let's talk about the arcade. The arcade has a great number of games and good games. I believe now they have these fighting robots, but I don't think they work right now... Once your done playing, you cash in your tickets or save the tickets, to get a prize! Also for all the area is can get crowded, I recommend coming once it opens.

The Marinara sauce was cold and not good at all. We tried this pizzadilla item and they brought it out and it was dry and disgusting. We asked for a manager and he made us a new one with more sauce but the sauce was cold and didn't make this pizzadilla item any better. The service was horrible too and as quickly as possible we just got our check and paid and left.",
