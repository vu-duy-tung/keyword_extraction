    "text": "Much like everyone else has said great ambiance,  but that's petty much where it ends.  Sat at the bar ordered the crispy pork nuggets, inside out spicy tuna and a pizza.  Pork nuggets were terrible, not crispy and extremely dry.  The spicy tuna was good basically a deconstructed spicy tuna roll should have a soy marinade or sauce with it though.  Pizza was ok nothing special,  at least the toppings seemed of high quality.  Out the door with tip for two people about 120 a little bit pricey in my opinion.",

    "text": "I went in for dinner today and had an ok experience.   On the positive side, all of the staff was friendly and welcoming. The food was well-prepared and tasty - though a little pricey for the amount you get. I would recommend the wood fired pizza (called \"South of the Border\") which was decent size and flavorful and the Blind Pig salad.  The lounge feel was nice and it wasn't too crowded so you could have a good conversation and enjoy your drink/dinner.  In terms of areas for improvement, there were a few. They need to tweak the menu to give better value (portion to price) on some items and to right-size other items.  (I can't believe they don't have a small side salad that you can order with a main dish.) The serving staff needs to gain a little more experience as they seemed shaky and unfamiliar with some of the menu items. Lastly, beware of the drink sizes! I ordered a glass of wine and received a 3oz pour - about half what you'd expect from a lounge/bar but at full bar prices.  I asked the server about it and she said it was just an illusion because of the glass size - I don't think so!  As they're still pretty new, I'll cut them some slack but they need to work out some of the kinks. I'd give them a few weeks to make some tweaks and then try them again.  There is potential to make this a nice little off-strip lounge/eatery.",

    "text": "Friend brought us to this place to try out. We walked in and was not acknowledged, we sat down at our own volition after ten minutes of waiting. Five or so minutes later, what seemed to be the busser, came and took our drink order, a few beers, water, and a tea. Waitress came by, seven minutes later, asked if we needed drinks, we said we orderd some, the tea and water already being out, the beers being completely forgotten about. Had to retell what the beers were, they came out eight minutes later. The place was NOT busy, three other tables, one being a table of eight. Waitress came back after another six minutes asked if we were ready, we responded with \"yes\" she walked away, I got her attention again before she got too far, we placed orders. Food came out promptly, eight minutes, two of our four ordered burgers, no condements were offered we had to flag down the bartender to get some as our waitress was no where to be found. Food was good, props to the kitchen. Drinks were dry and no one came by, we didnt know what the waitress was doing. Twenty three minutes later the busser came by and refilled the water and tea, no mention of the beers to be had. Seventeen minutes later, the busser came and cleared the table, we had just finished eating. Thirty seven minutes later the waitress came by to see if we needed anything, we asked for a check, four minutes later we got it. One of our group felt bad that she didnt put the two beers we had on the check so when she came back six minutes later told her, she said, \"What beers did you have?\" Responded with one of their ambers and a Firestone, she goes \"Oh\". Leaves comes back two minutes later with, \"So you didn't get the beers?\", we said, \"No we got them, they just were not charged to the bill.\" Responding, \"Okay let me add them.\" My thought when she didnt add them was maybe it was a nice comp for the realization of poor service, but this statement proves not. Comes back four minutes later again with the final bill charged and walks away, full meal finally finished. No thank you or come again, mind you we were not rude by any means, and actually were curious if we had done something to get the service we got. One hundred and thirty three minutes for a meal. Mind you the time with friends was nice, food was good, service was atrocious. I was let down by all the reviews. I will not be coming back to this establishment.",

Over all great lunch. Clean, a very pleasant staff, good food but lack of parking is the only draw back and why I can't go 5 stars. Nothing to do with the dinning experience but parking is the first thing you do when get anywhere.  A must try for locals!!!",

    "text": "Facing Dean Martin Drive in the ground floor of Panorama Towers, The Blind Pig stands unique in its upscale yet unpretentious interior design, its split operation (restaurant/bar on one side, quick packaged deli on the other), and its level of service in its immediate neighborhood.    Friends and I often meet here due to its proximity to Liberace Garage, just down Dean Martin Drive.  You would have to cross over the freeway to City Center and the Strip or travel a several miles west before coming across a competitor.  It sits defiantly in the industrial sector, but overlooking the gleaming towers of City Center just across I-15.  This makes its ambiance, design and level of service almost defiant when juxtaposed with the location, and very refreshing.  High ceilings and retro-industrial feel cross with diamond-tuck booths.  Floor-to-ceiling windows on the east wall make it bright by day, scenic by night, conditions magnified if you sit on the patio.  The bartenders are serious mixologists with great inventory.  The Blind Pig just underwent a renovation of its patio and re-vamp of its menu, so I was eager to try it out.  I was happy to see they didn't seem to change what was already working, with a minor exception or two below.  The patio saw the addition of heavier barriers to the parking lot and heaters.  The menu has always been a bit of Italian fusion, with decent gluten free pizza options, great French Dip and pulled pork.  It was quite unique in its variety.  The new incarnation appears to be an attempt to be more Italian, with other options falling off.  Paper-in-portfolio menus have unfortunately given way to laminated one pagers, with heavy lettering of the I-wish-this-looked-like-a-little-italy-joint.  It's an odd Denny's sort of intro to a place that otherwise seems more sophisticated - not to mention that laminate collects finger germs and is seldom sterilized.  Nobody wants to have to do a hand wash between ordering and eating.  The coffee is a problem.  They don't brew, they use those ridiculous capsules, as if this were a free breakfast at a Holiday Inn.  The cappuccino, while not horrible, is likewise from a machine (you won't need sugar), not a barista.  That's forgivable to me, but not at the ~$6 they charge.  If you are trying for an Italian authenticity, you can't do it without teaching staff to make espresso and cappuccino at a minimum, and don't insult me by pricing like its the real thing when it isn't.  Even a regular black coffee refill will cost you full price ~$3.  It will also refill the landfill, given the amount of garbage created from one cup of this pre-measured capsule stuff.  I suggest dumping the Marriott Courtyard lobby machine and sticking to the real thing.  I hope they change this, I'd love to update and say this is fixed.  The music is usually the perfect level or conversation and is themed to standards of the Sinatra era, at least as of this writing.  It fits well.  The service is consistently good without being in your face all the time.  In short, great design, good menu with these minor quirks to work out.  The blind pig is great asset to its neighborhood.",

    "text": "If you didn't know already, The Blind Pig is a slightly unusual blend of bar/lounge, restaurant and market all rolled up into a space just beneath the Panorama towers. The parking outside is pretty limited and although the space itself is pretty large, there isn't much seating if you do plan to dine in. Even with the limited space, this slightly hipster-esque joint has a very cool vibe and unique styling. The big booths are comfy and having pillows to lay back on after stuffing your face is always a plus. Oh, and quick tip...kids are more than welcome, but it's probably best to bring them along during breakfast-lunch hours.  The menu itself is a lot larger than I expected and has quite a bit to offer, including several options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Adding to the regular menu is Chef specials which seem to be available on any given day. They've also got a full coffee and juice bar that pumps out fresh squeezed mixes and smoothies. To start off, I had an iced chai latte which could hold it's own next to just about any coffee shop in town. It was smooth, creamy and wasn't overly spiced. We also had orange juice and a strawberry-banana smoothie that were equally delicious.  I had a hard time deciding what to order since one of the Chef specials of the day was a meatball sandwich and I love those. Ultimately, I ended up going with the shrimp & lobster roll that I've had my eye on since I bookmarked this place though. The flavor was surprisingly great! There was enough Old Bay seasoning on there to taste without ruining the flavor of the shrimp or lobster, which were both nice and tender. I also appreciated that they don't drench the seafood in mayo. The roll was a nice texture and had enough butter to compliment the ingredients, but at just under $15, I thought the meat to bread ratio was a little off. There was a few bites where I was just eating all bread. Even so, it was a solid sandwich and the potato salad served by it's side was very tasty. Thick chunks of potato with a nice hint of mustard and again, just the right amount of mayo.   As far as the pricing goes, the structure is a bit weird. We also ordered one of the other Chef's specials which was a pulled pork sandwich, and it was priced at $15. The pork was juicy and their slightly sweet but tangy BBQ sauce was great, but I questioned the price. Why? Well, because apart from the $14.5 shrimp and lobster roll, we also ordered a breakfast sandwich that was only $6. Obviously, it wasn't as big but with thick slices of bacon, 2 eggs and cheese on a English muffin, the value was much better. It was easily the best $6 breakfast sandwich I've eaten and was served with a delicious side of lyonnaise potatoes.  Honestly, I came into The Blind Pig with pretty low expectations and I don't know why. I can happily say that both the food and serviced surprised me a lot. Extremely friendly and attentive staff, great food and a great ambience. We ordered a lot more food then we usually do for the 3 of us and walked out for $60. I am a fan and will be back!",

    "text": "I was hoping to rave about this place but unfortunately that is not the case. This place was probably one of my top 5 worse customer service experience ever! Let me try and paint the picture for you... It was the spot we selected for a surprise birthday. Venue was very cute and quaint, with brick walls making me feel like there was a lot of history behind the building. Something you would see in New York. It was a Saturday and not busy at all. The restaurant had a different type of set-up, almost in a shape of an L. Our party of 10 sat in the smaller section. We had one server & later found out it was her first day. In the beginning majority of the party was going up to the bar to get our drink orders. The bartender informed us that if we are with the big party, our server will come to us. Fine, no big deal. It took the server about 15 minutes to make her way to us where she would only start with 3 drink orders at a time. Drinks slowly (key word) trickled out. Before making sure the whole table was good with drinks and even water for the entire party she started taking food orders. It wasn't to our knowledge that food orders weren't all taken nor placed until only ours came out. We are here for dinner, we all eat together! The server was very sweet but definitely needs more experience prior to working a big party let alone be on the floor by herself. She immediately informed the staff. Next thing we know the bartender is coming to take our order. He says 'everyone needs to sit down so I can get food orders taken and in at the same time'. I chuckled about this. He made it seem like it was our fault the server couldn't do her job. Again, some orders were placed now for the second time. Throughout this whole waiting period, our sever was not attentive at all. Multiple times I asked to make sure the whole table had waters, never came to check up on beverages. It's one thing that she is new but the restaurant had about 3 other tables to service. Where was the rest of the staff? Food finally came out and to be quite honest, I'm 99.9% sure that the food we sent back the first time was now in front of us for the second time. We ordered the chicken pesto pizza and lobster Mac n' cheese. Both dishes were cold! The sauce of the lobster mac n cheese was thick and all saucy at the bottom; as it was just sitting out. Neither of them looked freshly made. And the comical part of it all not once did a manager come out and apologize. I was baffled at this establishment and their lack of customer service recovering. With all the constant back and forth and searching for our server and informing her of what we need, no one said or did anything.  Bills were spilt and came back with the first couple and charged them $11k. Aside from that amount actually authorizing the servers response was 'oh yea, I thought it looked funny'!! As bills were being settled lights were turned off. I understand we were there past 10PM, but that was not our fault. Have a little courtesy, Blind Pig and appreciate your customers a bit more!  Service is the only part of this experience that sticks in my mind in which I nor the rest of the party will never return!!",

    "text": "Met some friends here for a quick lunch - had mixed opinions.  I like the ambiance/vibe of the place and that they have a grab-and-go area full of pre-made food, including deli items like potato salad. Everything seems quite pricy though, so value proposition is definitely suspect.  As for our dine-in lunch, food was hit or miss. My kale salad was excellent. Friend's BP burger (ordered medium well) was severely undercooked. French dip sandwich was just meh, especially as the dip was pretty bland. Seared ahi tuna on the corresponding salad was not good - not sure if the tuna wasn't fresh or just poor quality. I didn't try the BBQ pulled pork sandwich but my friend said it was good. Orzo salad had really good texture but was painfully salty.  I get that cocktails are done in speakeasy style (hence the name of the establishment, I guess) but even for speakeasy style they seemed too sweet and overdone.  Service was OK, but definitely indifferent.  This seems like a spot that might be good for quick eats if you're in the area and don't want to head to the Strip, but you probably have to know what's good on the menu to make it worthwhile. I'm not sure I'd come again - if I do, I'll try more stuff and update this review, but this place is def closer to a 2* than a 4*.",

Later, checkin' in on me, she asks how things are and I tell her straight I'm still trying to figure out why her man decides how I eat my sandwich. She can tell I'm pissed, and homegirl was super apologetic, but again-- to what end? She comps me a drink and apologizes all over the place, but that's not what I asked for. And what I did ask for was apparently wholly outside the realm of possibility?  I steamed on this one for months (my visit was in November), and I don't care to speculate about homie's motives. This joint has all the right elements, but somebody's throwin' weight in that kitchen, and it ain't in the interest of customers.",

    "text": "Those who know me will tell you I am one difficult person to impress, a fact that still has my mother wondering where she could have gone wrong. But I promise you I can be impressed, and when it does happen, even I get a little chill up and down my spine.   If you hope to get my attention, especially with food, you better hit all the right notes at all the same time. From presentation and taste, service and atmosphere, right up to the bite you take out of my wallet, everything needs to fit just perfectly together if you hope to get a rave out of me. You can have the world's best food, but if I have to wait an eternity in line, or drop a small fortune, or suffer miserably apathetic service, then even the world's greatest food can suck.  But when everything you do fits perfectly together; when the food is good and the service is friendly and the price is a bargain, that's when you're doing things right.   And then there are those rare occasions when all those elements come together, except the food is not simply good it's extraordinary, that's when you're going to start making some serious impressions in my book.  Imagine for me, if you will, a simple bacon cheeseburger. If you are like me, it always has been, and likely always will be, one of life's great guilty pleasures.   Now imagine that simple bacon cheeseburger: with thick-cut smoked bacon, silky-smooth gruyere, arugula, and perfectly seasoned, grass-fed beef with just a hint of garlic aioli on top. Add all those elements together with the understated genius from The Blind Pig's kitchen and you have a bacon cheeseburger that requires no additional adornment, that challenges the lines of what makes a great burger. If you can imagine that (or better yet, if you can stop by The Blind Pig and try one for yourself) well then you will know firsthand what it takes to impress me - and I can promise you, I am very impressed.  Everybody knows you can get some really great burgers in Vegas these days, but I always find myself walking out wondering whether the extra cost and extra effort were really worth it. I will hold The Blind Pig's $12 \"BP Burger\" up against any burger in this town and say simply - \"beat that!\"  Can't wait to try what's next.",

I got the kale and greens salad with an added grilled chicken breaast - it was great., The vinagrette was so good I was licking it off my fork! The design and atmosphere was great, we loved the free smoothie for checking in on Yelp, and the friendly service could not be more welcoming.",

We brought our 1 year old which it does not feel like a place to bring your kids but there had high chairs and our waitress was supper sweet. And our kid is very well behaved and no one even noticed her until maybe before we were leaving and she was yelling hi to everyone at the bar that was finally starting to fill up at 7. The bar is beautiful and masculine. Dark woods and different textiles fill this space up but still feels open and minimal. They keep it cold so bring a jacket if you are easily chilled. The drinks on happy hour are 5 bucks. I got the sunny sunday. Its basically a Cadillac margarita. The blind pig is very very good. More like a vodka martini. We got the meatball app they were dry but they marinara was pretty good. The grass fed Burger was very very good. Well be back for lunch and smoothies and sandwiches will be our next adventure. I have to say the location is super fun and leaving to stare at the back of the cosmo and the aria is a great end to a terrific dinner.  Id recommend for dinner before a night out or pregaming before the club. I lovveee the Blind Pig. Id wanted to come for so long it was worth the wait.",

It really is hard picking a place to eat sometimes! Scrolling around through all the different Vegas eats, I found The Blind Pig.   For those who know me, it would be no surprise to you why I chose this place. It's simple really, I just love pigs :D They are cute, adorable and tasty ;)  Once we drove into the parking lot, there it was! A huge sign that says The Blind Pig. Oh the excitement I was feeling to try this place. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fg#tXPFoQrrELdARTlyB03xgA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  The inside decor is cute. Reminds me of a more old school, darker, feeling. I loved the booths, and of course I just had to sit in the booth right next to this awesome pig painting! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fg#xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fgb\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>   So of course after looking over the cocktail menu I just had to order THE BLIND PIG! And to top off my dorky pig obsession, I just had to take a picture of the cocktail with my travel buddy! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=50GFtOwsgv_s3-zyDAEK-Q#11_KCd5ioYZdzFvjboAY6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a> This cocktail is $10 and is a mixture of raspberry vodka, grand marnier, lime juice angostura and angostura orange.

Our server Nicole was nice & we did have a party of 9 but I only got my water refilled once, after having to ask for it. When I ordered my prime rib I hadn't realized she never asked me how I wanted it cooked, until I got my steak which was cooked well. Far overcooked from the medium rare that I like.   When it comes to the food the calamari was just okay. The prime rib was over cooked & just not very good. Tasted like a cheap cut of meat & not worth the $30. The pasta side was good but when I asked for what the side options were I chose pasta because she offered it & did not tell me it's an extra $3 for it. I don't mind the price but let people know ahead of time. The cheesecake was good & the chocolate cake was a little rich for my taste. Honestly the best thing here was the pretzel bites. If you're looking for pretzel bites then give it a shot.",

I'm not sure if it is a seasoning but it was overpowering.  Pork belly- very yummy!  Cut in small enough pieces. Crunchy and tasty!  Guacamole - tasted fresh and satisfying  Pizza - this was better than my entree and I was happier eating this. Thin and simple  The appetizers here are really great.  I feel there were options on the menu id like to try. This place has a lot of potential. It seems like it would be a great place to grab some drinks before a night out.",

    "text": "Just okay for now...  Restaurant, Ambiance, and Location:  4 Stars Service:  More like 2.5 Stars, but I will round up to 3. Food Selection / Taste:  3 Stars  Price:  3 Stars ($50 for a two salads and two meals)  We arrived for a quick dinner before a show.  My only knowledge of the Blind Pig was from other Yelpers check-in's.  My experience wasn't tainted because I haven't read any of the reviews.  In other words, I came here \"blind\".  Service was a little less than average, but it's all about the food and drinks, right?  I got the BP Burger and requested it to be prepared medium-well.  I took a bite and realized it was more medium than medium-well.  I didn't complain because the burger was actually pretty good.  Complimenting my burger was a ton of sweet potato fries that were just okay.  I also got to taste my gf's Shrimp & Lobster Mac.  I could tell just by looking at the Mac that it was lacking a little taste.  In my opinion, their Shrimp & Lobster Mac can use a little more shrimp, lobster, cheese, and mac.    Overall, I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of the Blind Pig.  Ambiance is cool, their burger is pretty good, the service can be better, and the shrimp & lobster mac can use some work.  For now, they are just okay.",

And prices were a little better   We got a chipped salad sub articles in place of salami. We had wanted Acavedo but the restaurant was out.  The salad was delicious. My wife thought it had too much cheese and not enough veggies which I did of agree with but it was still really good. The server asked us if we wanted extra dressing but the salad was already drenched in dressing.    We got a large cheese pizza which was $17.99 which I think is a bit pricey for a cheese pizza.   Our server recommended extra sauce which we asked for. The sauce was still not enough and the little sauce we got had zero flavor. Maybe there wasn't enough sauce to actually taste it. The cheese was sparse and the entire pizza was over cooked.  I prefer a pizza with a crispy crust. I didn't ask for this pizza to be well done but it was well done. To the point that the crust had a chat and the cheese was dried out and didn't have its cheesy pull anymore.  I asked the server for a extra side of sauce and maybe some garlic powder.  I got marinara and garlic salt. The server tried. But the marinara sauce was not a good sub for pizza sauce.  I didn't like its flavor and the garlic salt which I blindly put on my slice ruined it. Why would you give me garlic salt?    The service was great overall. Very fast and attentive. The sale is get again. We went because we were craving pizza but the pizza really was not very good at all.   They have outside seating and unfortunately the sound of the freeway really ruins it.",

Roomie and I had a day off together and decided to brunch here with another friend. Weather was sunny and breezy so, it was perfect for patio dining.   Walked into their cafe/grocery/market side and thought that was a super cute idea. How perfs for those living in Panorama to walk downstairs for their good Good of beer, wine, Moet, McConnell's ice cream, toiletries, even Tylenol (for the hangover and errthang). The vibe and decor was very nice and hip and reminds me of LA. I hate saying that but, I feel like Vegas is becoming \" SO LA.\"  We ordered crispy pork nuggets, lobster mac and cheese, ahi crunch salad, and fries. There was nothing crispy about that pork, nor was it anything nugget-like. If you've had chicharron; it's nothing like that! Also, it tasted better w/o the aioli dipping sauce.  Crunch salad was ok; I felt it was a bit too mayonaissey with not enough crunch. Seared ahi on the salad looked bigger on Yelp pics lol And it had NO taste, unless tasting \"mushy\" was a flavor. Lobster mac and cheese was a best thing about brunch for me because I liked the  al dente pasta and light sauce. There was quite a bit of lobster and skrimp in there, too.  Actually, scratch my last comment about the lobster mac/cheese being the best thing about brunch --- THE VIEW of Aria, the freeway, and Vdara was the best thing about brunch --- and I'm not being sarcastic about it.  Service was great tho. The bar was closed but, the manager still managed to make me a Jamie ginger.",

Apparently they just started a happy hour...ends at 7, so we missed out.   We tried some fancy cocktails. Around $10 each. Tasty. I had a ginger something. It was, indeed, gingery.   We shared pork belly nuggets, meatballs and shrimp and lobster Mac and cheese. Nuggets were A-OK. They tasted too much like a bottle of sweet chili sauce for my liking. Meatballs were tender and very flavorful. Mac and cheese was spot on - deeeelish! Creamy, dreamy and generous on the shrimp and lobster. We finished with the ultra decadent layered chocolate hazelnut dessert with salty crunchy bits and a anchor steam. Pure bliss.   For being so hip and swanky, I thought the portions and prices were quite reasonable. We felt cool just being there for sure. Definitely a fun spot to take visitors for some off the beaten path swank. We also had our 2 year old in tow which was no problem at all.   Service was very attentive and nice. We will def go back. I'd like to try their brunch for sure!",

My only comment is that it came with a small side of housemade potato salad and it was ok...I was not impressed.  If I wanted fries, it is an upgrade and a small extra charge.

It was happy hour and the place was packed (awesome for business). The staff was very friendly and accommodating but we were confused by who was actually our server.  The food was the least impressive.  We tried the meatballs, pork nuggets and the Poutine.  I expected homemade but I'm pretty sure the pork belly was smothered in some jar sauce and the meatballs were previously frozen.  Also, the gravy in the Poutine seemed like it was from a mix.  This place has so much potential! The interior is cute with exposed brick.  The little store attached is probably great for the residents nearby.

Not horrible, but even with the meat toppings it was bland and the dough was more closely related to bread dough than actual pizza dough.  I ordered the 'secret menu' pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. There was nothing great about the sandwich, however, the BBQ sauce had a lot of sugar in it or maybe not enough vinegar. Hard to say. The highlight was the perfectly done sweet potato fries. $18.50 total.  My wife ordered the fried chicken plate with fries substituted for the mash. The chicken looked good, wasn't sitting a puddle of grease. However, it was just three pieces for $18. I asked my wife what she thought and she said it was good, but not $18's good.  Drinks were priced slightly hire than other places, but not terrible so. i.e. $7 for a pint of Bass ale.  Overall, it was just an OK meal. Two things that would bring me back was the atmosphere and the service, definite thumbs up there, however that really doesn't warrant me making a trip there. I'm sure this place is a life saver for those who reside in the towers and probably the main vein of their revenue.",

These guys mix up the great drinks you would expect from a Speakeasy type place.  Lots of beers and a nice wine list too.  The servers are always on it.  I tip my hat to the Chef.  Brilliant menu creation.  I am currently at the Panorama welcome happy hour with the samples coming around and can tell you this Chef is straight killing it.   There is even a pantry with beers to go, delicious deli items, and what have you.  Outdoor seating with cool strip views.  This place has it all.  If you come to The Blind Pig, chances are you will find me.",

It is actually across the freeway and it would have been an awkward walk there so we decided to just take a cab (which of course we got raped on the cab fare.)   The place was roomy and decor was great. I assume most of the people there were residents of Panorama Towers. They also had outdoor seating for those many beautiful Vegas days. Their menu had great choices and I had a hard time deciding. I was a fool to get their pizza! Though the pizza was huge and pretty tasty. My favorite were the pork nuggets! I don't eat pork often but man these were tasty!!! They're like bacon but a bit sweeter and in cube form. You can just eat these with beer after beer after beer and it would be the best meal! Perfect little bites.   My fiancee got the pulled pork sandwich special which he inhaled in about 30 seconds. We didn't even get to see what the dish looked like. lol. Our friends got sandwiches too but was not able to try them. They seemed to like it though.  Service is fantastic, very attentive and helpful and totally sincere. It's a very cozy place, not loud and rowdy. It is pretty relaxing in there and they have a decent selection of beers. I recommend  Blind Pig if you live in Vegas or just visiting.",

The clams with white sauce I had ordered for an appetizer had fresh clams with canned clams added to it. I do not understand the point behind this. The sauce was over salted by a lot. My guess is the sauce was batch done and left on a warmer to reduce. The Penne Puttanesca was nothing more than tomato sauce with ,I'm sure, every single olive they had in the joint. Not impressed by any means. GF had the Eggplant Parmigiana Sandwich. It was pre-breaded frozen eggplant put on par-cooked bread that the kitchen didn't bother to finish off the baking process. I work in a kitchen and can spot shit food when I see/taste it. They are way overpriced for the quality of food they serve. I'm guessing the bar is what keeps the restaurant afloat. If you are looking for a place to watch a UFC fight and have a couple beers, this is a good spot. To order food with those beers is your call but I'd hit In&Out right down the street.",

    "text": "Although this was our first experience and cannot be measured to others, we had a great time @ the blind pig!! We definitely appreciate good food that is close to the fun of the strip without being right on the strip. This restaurant is like the hidden gem we have been looking for in terms of good food and a cool, nice yet casual atmosphere. The ambiance was awesome with the dim lights, nice music, and funny pig artwork, and the booths were both stylish and comfortable in the bar setting. It's not so much a restaurant as it is a lounge area that serves food... When we walked in we didn't see any host stand... and there was a bar top with tvs that were playing basketball on one side of the room so we assumed we just sat ourselves. But we were able to choose our own seats immediately after entering at dinner hour on a Saturday night and had great service. Everyone was very helpful and nice to make suggestions. We ordered the pork bites for an appetizer and both got the steak sandwich for dinner. The app was amazing! It was a rather small portion but for two people sharing it before dinner it was good to taste. :) it was a little spicy and very flavorful and it was half off during happy hour which lasted the length that we were there (from 5 to almost 6:15).  The entree was also great! It was very flavorful and not skimpy on the steak at all. And the fries were also up to par. :) we also ordered wine that was on the happy hour price list.. A good glass for $4. We liked that a lot too because we usually don't see happy hour wine specials when we go out. The lounge/dining area was clean and comfortable and all of our food met (if not exceeded) our expectations. We will be back for sure and we will bring friends next time!",

Some members of the party were uncomfortably warm early on, and the staff were kind enough to move our entire party to the other section, which was farther away from the kitchen - even dragging in outside patio furniture to seat us all.  The servers were attentive and there wasn't a single incorrect order across our entire party. Everyone was happy with the selection and the price - where you can spend $10, or you can spend $50 on a single person.   Drinks are a little pricey at $12 for cocktails, but I've never actually been to a restaurant where the Whisky Sour is actually made with egg whites - except this one. All the cocktails were excellent.   They only added in a 15% gratuity to the check. If you enjoyed their service, throw a little more in.",

Generally when I am looking for some where to eat and my boyfriend is at the same time, my searches start with Poutine while his start with wings. The Blind Pig has BOTH.  The Blind Pig is so freaking cute!! I noticed it driving up the 15 headed for work once. It's kind of hidden on Dean Martin on the ground floor of the Panorama. I have since moved and this place isn't any where close to home, but I still make the trip. Worth it!  They have a fun little menu and awesome beer choices. The prices are pretty solid too. Nothing is worse than finding a place you like but it's too expensive for regular visits.  Parking can get crappy if it's crowded. The lot is pretty small. Also, remember it closes at midnight! So if you are looking for late night eats, you will have to stick with good ol' Peppermill.  Another interesting thing about the Blind Pig is the market and deli they have attached. I actually haven't stopped in because I usually head here late (and I don't believe the market is open), but it looks really neat!",

I can't remember from the 2 because honestly was not that memorable. However, my first time I had the BP burger and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best burgers I've ever had. The patty itself was pretty thick and they used a good quality beef which I think makes or breaks a burger. The bacon they used was so thick and crisp, to the point if I dropped it on the floor it would have shattered. I can't remember what the sauce was but I think it was some type of mayo/ayoli. They used arugula for the greens, which I thought was a clever touch. But overall this burger was amazing. If you are a burger fan definitely order this. Both times I was there we ordered the poutine primarily because it's Canadian thing and hard to find anywhere in the U.S. I am not a fan at all, but I guess I could say it was good. The interior of this place can be best described as \"dapper\" with random pig pictures, but they are done tastefully. Service has been great on both visits. If you have ever wondered about this place I definitely do recommend them.",

Then they put a valet outside to make it more difficult to easily get in and out, I guess pretending to be some type of luxury restaurant.

They had a wall of liquor that was massive! I couldn't even get it all on one photo. The menu is very interesting. It was mostly Italian, but there was some Asian flair mixed in. I tried the \"50 Shades of Bleu\" cocktail which was a fun take on a Moscow Mule. I also tried the cheese garlic bread. It was soft ciabatta bread that was crunchy on the outside with melted cheese. It came with a tasty Italian marinara sauce. They had nice private booths that would be great for a date night dinner. Definitely worth the trip!",

Beer list could use some mending but there's enough there to please anyone with a good IPA or Belgian for $8 or less.  Menu is large with your typical pub burgers and sandwiches and pizza, but also some nice entrees and pastas as well for a better meal.  Service was good and my burger was cooked perfectly and quite large with the inclusion of a side salad over fires at no extra charge.  $12 burger and $7 IPA made for an affordable meal and great place to watch a game nearby the strip. Blind Pig is well worth it for game day.",

There's no breakfast menu even on their site. At the top of that menu it said lunch starts at 10:30. Ok, only 15 mins away, so we ask to see lunch menus and our waitress says lunch begins at 11:00. So we broke down and got breakfast, it was ok, tough to screw up eggs and bacon. The real kicker was at 10:35 when some other customers came in and were seated next to us with lunch menus! We asked a different waitress when lunch began and she said 10:30.... we told her what we were told by our waitress and no apology or anything. We really wanted lunch and if it wasn't for the incompetent waitress we had, we would've come back later, but not anymore. Might want to train your staff a little better.",

    "text": "Hidden away from the strip in a dark kinda industrial area next to the freeway is where you will find The Blind Pig of awesomeness!  Oh wow was this good and just a super chill speakeasy type atmosphere with delicious food and bomb drinks!  One thing I've noticed about Yelp is that you really can find some awesome places when you pull up the local feed in areas that your unfamiliar with this was no exception and a great find!  When we first walked in it looked kinda like a deli that had some grocery type goods with a few chairs and a counter but as soon as we looked to the left we could see that there was a whole other room behind the curtain giving it a kinda hidden feel from the front.  We sat down and started browsing the drink menu even though at this moment I wasn't really feeling a cocktail they sounded delicious and unique as well as free with check-in! You could also order a few other drinks for free with your check-in of those a smoothie sounded delicious and it so was packed with berry goodness all around!  It's kinda dark inside too so it provides a bit of a ambiance that's perfect for a mellow night and why my pictures are dark I didn't feel like it would be right to use a flash here and disturb other patrons.  For dinner I decided to order a Steak Sandwich it was super good the steak was cooked perfectly full of flavor and went well with the garlic aioli sauce that was on the delicious bun!  My lady ordered a pesto type pizza with white sauce it had broccoli, olives, onions and other delicious toppings not knowing how big it was the pizza was definitely enough for two of us which ment we got to bring some back to the hotel and oh was it good later in the night after a few drinks!  This is an awesome establishment with delicious food and a great vibe to keep it mellow I would highly recommend coming here if your looking to get away from the strip for a bit and enjoy yourself!  We could definitely see ourselves coming back here on one of our next Vegas trips as everything was excellent!",

    "text": "This was my first time here.. I'd always drive by wanting to check it out.. I mean who wouldn't want to eat at a place called the blind pig? So I finally made it! Sadly there's issues with their liquor license, so I couldn't get my drink on.. they did let us bring our own alcohol in, but it's still not the same.  Interior is amazing! Booths were big and comfortable.. the hostess was very sweet, and I feel she was more attentive than my actual server. Both of them were very apologetic about the liquor license..  So boyfriend ordered the pepperoni calzone which was HUGE and so delicious! I had ordered the pork chop with pasta which was also extremely delicious! But we did have to wait 40min for our food.. the first 20min ok pork chop could take a while depending how thick it is.. 30min later wondering where my server is to see what's going on; she's outside sitting on her boyfriend's or some guy's lap.. I get it it's slow, but I am a server and I would never want my customers to see me like that especially if you want a good tip.  She finally made it back to our table to apologize for the wait and offered bread.. my issue is if something on the menu is guaranteed to take over 25minutes you let your guests know ahead of time. Especially being the only table in the whole place it's ridiculous to wait that long.   Sadly, I will return if they ever get their liquor license back.. hopefully customer service is much better then.  2 stars only because the food was actually super good! (But not worth the wait) and because the hostess was actually really nice and still tried doing her best even though it's slow. They have something great here they need a staff who sees it!",

    "text": "My friend wanted to try this place. I'd never seen nor heard of it so it was a new adventure in the foodie quest.   Located at the entrance to Panorama Towers, just down the block from Las Vegas Golf and Tennis and In and Out near Trop and Dean Martin. Not the easiest place to find, and seemingly out of place considering what we walked into. One side is a deli/mini grocery store. The other a really nice bar and about 14 tables for dinner. This place is non-smoking for those of you who indulge. They have a few tables outside giving you a beautiful view of City Center from the west side of I-15.  Impressive menu, high class furnishings, and friendly service. They've been there about a year and according to the bartender, busy nights vary constantly. When we walked in at 5:30 on a Monday, it was 3/4 full but no one sitting at the bar, so we sat.  A nice selection of beers, arranged on the menu by category. I had a Pissing Boy Belgian White Ale. My friend a Hoegaarten. We started with an appetizer of Crispy Pork Nuggets, which is pork belly in a sweet chili glaze, with a sriracha aioli, and peanuts. Delightfully crisp and light and loaded with flavor. 10/10.  I went with the shrimp and lobster mac and cheese, which the bartender told me was rich. I found it delightful, not overly sauced or cheesed, and delicious. Not nearly as rich as the mac and cheese at MadeLV. My friend went with the Prime roast beef sandwich and he said it was one of the best he'd ever had, the roll being soft and good. Overall these dishes get 9.5/10.  Prices are moderate. Upon check-in with Yelp you get a free drink, either coffee, soda, or signature cocktail. I went with the Blind Pig cocktail, which while tasty, was a bit sweet for me.   Come and enjoy this nice quiet little place with great food. I'll be back for sure!",

Idk wtf happened but this place went from top of the line to bottom of the barrel  What a disappointment - ordered 2 items I've ordered in the past - steak sandwich & a burger & both were horrendous! The burger literally had a generic store bought bun that I wouldn't even use if I was BBQ'ing burgers - top bun didn't fit & bottom bun was non- existent. The steak sandwich that I couldn't quit raving about before is now a greasy mess loaded with green peppers - not even reminiscent of the one I had here before. This was more like a bad Philly not to mention both the burger & steak Sammy came wrapped in low budget foil so the cheese on the Sammy was stuck to the foil & the burger was completely smashed. Prior orders came in plastic boxes with see-thru covers & the fries didn't used to come in brown paper bags. SO low budget. We were very excited to order from here since past deliveries were amazing but I won't order here again after this experience. If it was only a little off that'd be forgivable but this was like a diff place entirely!  & here we thought we had a new go to place but much like everything else in Vegas - it's a facade! They trick you by being so great just to pull out the rug from your feet & suck like everywhere else   Good riddance Blind Pig idk if you changed management it just your cooks but you went from a solid A+ to a -F in my book - & it's really too bad cuz you were really great",

After ordering (two sandwiches), it took forevvvvver for the food to arrive. And they were NOT busy.

    "text": "Very cool spot between the Panorama Towers and The Martin behind City Center.  I had a late breakfast/early lunch with a buddy at the Bling Pig on a Friday.  The place was empty, but a few customers came in the market side of the business.  We sat down and were immediately approached by a server.  She was very friendly, and was throughout the meal.  Refills were prompt, as was the check.  Great service throughout.  The restaurant side is very comfortable, but non-descript.  It's like what a TV set of \"location:  pub\" would look like.  That said, I didn't have any problems with it.  It has a nice bar, TVs, and plenty of additional seating.    I went with the meaty wrap, which is scrambled eggs, cheese, sausage, bacon, and ham in a tortilla with a side of breakfast potatoes.  It was a great deal for $8.  The wrap was fresh, it was still steaming when it was brought to the table.  And, it is certainly packed full of meat and cheesy goodness.  The cheddar was in every bite, which was nice.  The eggs were scrambled well and weren't overcooked.  The tortilla could have used some crisping on the exterior.  A minute or so on the flat top with a little butter would have added a ton of flavor and made it look nicer.  The breakfast potatoes were fine, they needed additional seasoning.  But, average.  Overall, it was a strong breakfast, and like I said, a good value for $8 given the amount of food.  I also tried the shrimp and lobster mac n cheese.  There is plenty of seafood in it, you should get some in every bite.  It was topped with breadcrumbs, which is always a good idea, but they weren't toasted enough under the broiler.  They needed a little longer to really crisp up to give some texture.  I liked the sauce, but it was a little lacking in flavor.  The menu states it's a \"mascarpone cream sauce with fontina.\"  I would agree with this, those are good cheeses but not the most flavorful.  I would invite some of that cheddar from the wrap to the party, or at least some parmesan.  I'd order it again, but it needed a good helping of pepper and hot sauce.  Overall, cool joint, I would return.",

We came to watch the GSP fight and we had our own big screen and table on the patio! Best Chicago pizza I have had outside of LA and Chicago!! The owner and his son were very accommodating despite the rush of people bombardment. Our server Shay was a dream and would love to have her again for the next fight!! Thank you Shay for your personality! !",

I went here around 1pm on a Thursday and they had blocked out half of the parking spots for customers. This is a tiny lot to begin with....Why would you do this? Oh wait.... They now have valet. Completely unnecessary for day time.   I ordered their turkey club with fries and coffee with baileys. My server was nice, however my club sandwich was missing the Swiss cheese and bacon. I hate sending food back so I just ate half and had the rest to go. I probably won't be back here.",

Grabbed a seat at the bar with Jared, nice guy, very warm and friendly. The set up was odd. There was an enormous brick column separating one half the bar from the other. Felt like awkward and detached.   Menu was nice and clean, one page.  I went with the BP chopped salad after first ordering the chicken Caesar..my neighbor had already ordered one and when I looked over and saw what appeared to be bland old ice berg lettuce as the foundation, I made the switch. In addition to the salad I added two lobster tacos..one flour and one corn tortilla, why? Cause I felt certain the corn would be over powering and clash with the lobster but like any good scientist, I ran both experiments. I was right, the corn totally over took what was a very good lobster taco.  The BP salad was also good but it was drowning in red vinaigrette dressing and by the time I got to the bottom, I had to force myself to eat the chopped bits of cheese and salami that had inevitably fallen off the fork.  All washed down with a single glass of 'a brother from another mother' whiskey which was treated with lime juice over a large block of ice and garnished with a lime twist. Absolutely delicious cocktail. Best part of the meal. In retrospect, I should have had two cocktails and three lobster tacos on flour tortillas.",

Wanting to go off the strip we selected the BP and were amazingly surprised. The double pork chop entry with sauteed spinach was cooked to perfection; the grilled chicken with a side of pasta on Alfredo sauce and a healthy serving of sauteed spinach did not disappoint; and the panini salmon with mixed greens was a huge serving so much so that I shared the entry with my girlfriend. It was chock full with \"fresh\" salmon accompanied by a great aioli pesto. And fresh warm french bread for the table. The only thing that did not work was the cosmopolitan which was way toooo sweet but I should have brought it to the attention of our server who by the way was very attentive. If you are going to a show give yourself time because it took a while to get our meals on the table. The quality of the food was what you would expect to find at your favorite bistro with a relaxed atmosphere.",

It should have ended there and all's good. The server then walked over and lied and blamed the kitchen. We said no big deal, accepting the lie and said just forget it.  As they were taking our plates away the appetizer shows up. We don't eat it because it's time has passed. Now the good part. We ask for the bill and there it is. The appetizer is charged, even when we said don't bring it twice, two different people... Not good!",

Well the prices that are listed online are not the same as what they charge. I was not happy, but paid the girl and she left. I opened the salad and saw there was no dressing provided and no dressing on the salad. Normally I wouldn;t care, but I'm in the process of moving and had no salad dressing and the salad was also $17. I called back and was told they'd send the delivery girl back over with the dressing (I'm next door) as soon as she got back. I wait 25 mins and call back and the delivery girl answers saying there was dressing on it and if I wanted more I should have asked. She brought the dressing and snarkily handed it to me. I get it, it's an inconvenience to bring the dressing, but it's your job. You're not a volunteer, it's your job ... that you are paid to do. As a reasonably intelligent adult, I feel confident in my ability to assess whether or not a salad has dressing on it and don't need to argue with someone about it, it's silly.   This is my last bad experience with this place, we won't be ordering ever again.",

    "text": "So I'm an all around huge fan of this somewhat hidden gem off the strip; from the awesome food, to the amazing friendly service, to the ambiance and decor of the establishment. This is def a great Las Vegas Foodie experience in my opinion.   Where do I start? Okay so when you get to The Blind Pig, they have two sections: a cafe or bakery (can't remember the exact name) and the other said as the Lounge. The bakery or cafe side is where you can come in and grab made and packaged sandwiches and salads for on the go, along with breads and drinks. Then the lounge side is the dining area with a full bar and bar seating available.   I'm totally in love with the ambiance and decor of the place! Very chic and romantic dark, like a dapper feel. And the pig decor is not overwhelming. It works. But the place has a dark mysterious touch like one that totally works as a great place to bring someone for a date!! Even the booth seating are tots romantic!!   Ooo and most definitely don't forget to check in on yelp to receive your one free drink!! And what I love most about this yelp promo is that it's not just house drinks, but includes speciality cocktails, speciality smoothies/juices, and speciality lattes or coffee drinks!! So they have a huge variety of drinks to choose from!! And they also have happy hour for drink from 10-close, so that's always a plus! Great drinks to pre-game your night with dinner and drinks before hitting the strip. And those speciality cocktails are sorta strong surprisingly.   Okay so onto food... You cannot leave this place without at least trying the Poutine! I love it! Definitely my favorite starter. They always have daily specials and they are worth hearing what they are to try. My go to is the Steakeasy Sandwich. The prime rib sandwich is also phenomenal. And the lobster and shrimp Mac and Cheese is probably one of the best I've had. They most def are not stingy with lobster/shrimp serving.   Another plus is if you order a salad as your side (you can pick salad, fries, or coleslaw when you order a sandwich) that depending on the dressing the salad is different. Like I get arugula when I order balsamic dressing. And the greens topping are different if you get thousand island. I love that!! Makes the meal different each time!    I've only had dessert here once and I honestly can't remember what I had but I know it musta been good lol but definitely an overall all around great dining experience every time! Love coming here whether it be lunch or dinner. Oh and they have free wifi! Haha so yeh a 5star spot for me!",

The mozzarella wedges and the calamari are musts as far as appetizers go.  Both are hand breaded and not overly fried.  Also, the homemade marinara sauce they serve with both of those apps is really good, probably some of the best I've had.  For entrees, the stuffed shells, the eggplant rigatoni, and the shrimp fricase are all excellent choices!!!  Their menu has many other options besides pasta, I'm just a pasta lover!  I think they also have pizza, sandwiches, burgers, and even steaks!  The best part about The Blind Pig is one of the waitresses, Amy!!!  She's so sweet and attentive and she offers great recommendations!!!  If you want a good meal and drinks away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, give The Blind Pig a try!",

It's like dang calm down. The golden rule is when I set my menu down I'm ready. Then finally we order and as I'm pointing at the menu I say \" the eggplant parmigiana sandwhich\" I ask if there is sweet potato fries as an option she said they are out. So I decided I'll take a side salad. Here's the kicker when the food comes out I get a plate of something that I didn't know what it was. I tell the same waitress I ordered with that it's not what I ordered. She reminds me that it is. Haha I said I got a sandwhich with a side salad. What was in front of me was a plate of spaghetti and eggplant parmigiana covered in cheese and red sauce. She proceeded to tell me that if I wanted the sandwhich it would take awhile. Starving I said forget it. We never saw her again and the guy I was with had to go to the bar to get a refill on his Diet Coke! The only saving grace was she comped my meal. But other than that holy moly this place has horrible service and it wasn't even busy!! I can't really judge the food because I got something I didn't even order. I was overall disappointed.",

    "text": "So after a long time coming I finally made it to The Blind Pig and I was glad I did.  Tucked under the Panorama towers on Dean Martin it is a nice spot for the residence. But everyone and their mom can enjoy it as well. They have a deli grab and go side and a sit down dinning area with a pretty awesome bar.   I went all because of their Pork Belly Nuggets a Delicouse crispy fatty nugget appetizer soaked in a Thai sweet chili sauce with peanuts and just the right amount of cilantro. I think the cilantro makes the whole thing so I hope you all like it but if not that's ok because this would be yummy with or without it. The Meaty Wrap breakfast burrito ok not amazing but really good. It have eggs, cheese, ham, bacon and house made sausage I think or of not it was gourmet sausage not no store bought Jimmy Dean (although I love me some Jimmy Dean) I thought that the gourmet one was a nice touch. The side of fried potatoes was amazing crispy, nicely season and cooked to perfection, not to mention they topped them with a little bit of sauteed onions which I loved! The salsa that came with the wrap was spicy to the right level and was just chunky enough.  I got a free Green Revolution smoothie with my Check in and my daughter loves it. It was the right blend of Kale, spinach, banana, pineapple, green apple and yogurt. Retail for $7 that was an awesome checkin!   I love the styling and decor of the Resturant Chic, comfy and casual upscale (if that makes sense) I am dying to try their other menu item so I will definitely be back! The only thing is I wish they would promote their brand more like putting their logo on the cups, bags or even togo boxes. It's advertisement and I would love to carry that around and show it off.",

I can see men liking this place the most, due to their big portions, beer, and their brick decorated walls and lounge setting. It is a self seating restaurant, so just pick a table because there is no hostess.  The menu offers your typical bar/American food, including appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, large entrees, coffee, smoothies, and cocktails. The Blind Pig is not only a restaurant, but they offer other prepared meals to go, or you can call in for your food and pick it up.  I ordered a BP Burger which includes Gruyere cheese, thick bacon, arugula, served with french fries. My friend ordered a chicken chopped salad, my favorite part about it is the vinaigrette they use.",

This time I actually got a table with my brother.  We walked in and were seated right away. It was crowded but not packed. Service from beginning to end was very courteous and attentive. Our iced teas were refilled several times and the food came out fairly quickly.   Now the reason I came here was to try the poutine. I've always heard of it but being as its a Canadian dish I had to try it. It did not disappoint. Fries with gravy and cheese curds just sounds so indulgent and rich. It was really good. The only problem I had with the dish was that it was pretty salty. The added gravy only made it saltier, and I like salty food. I couldn't finish it but I did enjoy it. I had the bacon and eggs too, which was good but you can't really mess up bacon and eggs, but if you do I will find you. And I will kill you. My brother had the prime rib dip and that was super good. I wished I had gotten that.  Everything is great about this place, the decor, the service, the food. The only thing stopping me from five stars is its a little over salted, and that's coming from a guy that usually adds salt.",

Sat waiting for my 2nd drink for over 10 mins. Red head bartender was obnoxious and talked over us during rare interactions. Young dark hair bartender with glasses was more concerned with asking the waitress how much she weighed than interact with guests that were waiting for drinks. He sure knew how to clean those glasses tho! I'd never come back here bc the service is horrible, which usually means the management is to. Cancelled our food order just as it came out and left. The bartender could care less why we cancelled our food, why we were leaving, what the issue was, nothing. Forgot to mention how the red haired bartender made my Makers and Coke and added ice last, which then spilled some of my drink into the ice bin. Amateur hour. Oh well.

Our waitress comes back with an excuse and says she is unable to provide a sample for me because the kitchen was backed up and she's not allowed to get it herself. 10 minutes later the manager comes over and presents the tuna with a nasty and disrespectful attitude. After speaking with her for a few minutes, I let her know that there were multiple misspelled words on the menu. She told me that she knows but it is not her responsibility because this is not her restaurant. Her response made me feel uncomfortable because as a manager you should take responsibility for the mistakes within your restaurant. It's unfortunate that the manager does not care about the restaurant she runs because I enjoy the food and the ambiance.   I did reach out to Block 16 Hospitality to give them the opportunity to make things right but I never heard anything back from them.",

I came here the first time with some friends how have a unit in the tower and I had a SUPER HIGH EXPECTATION... A fellow yelper had reviewed it as having the \"best burger in Vegas\"... Strong words.  I have had many burger in town and when somebody say that I always question it,  but I also have to try it...   So with that in my mind I came here to see if it was True.  Walking in the door  first impression his is a cool place... Dark tones stone wood and brick..classy.   I sit down and the bartenders were attentive informed and they were not to bad to look at either... I had a few cocktails all were delicious... Then the moment came and the burger arrived It looked fantastic and at first bite I was shocked that this might actually be the best burger in town... It is cooked p e r f e c t l y and seasoned and the bread it toasted and soft and fresh and the toppings are fresh and plentiful but not overwhelming... I started fast but as I got to the end I didn't want it I stop and noticed I was taking smaller and smaller bites... But eventually it was all gone... :-(  As I write this I find my self in that same position not wanting this to end...best burger in Vegas is not far off... It def makes my top 3 I have had and it had some distinguished company!!  Bottom line JUST ORDER THE BURGER... Ten next time actually look at the menu... There is alit of other tasty stuff on it too... Like crispy pork nuggets. That you will just have to experience yourself... Enjoy.",

    "text": "I was really excited to visit the Blind Pig. It is right outside the Panorama condos and I see it often on my way to work. Today I finally decided to stop by and see what it was all about. And I must say I am very underwhelmed by my experience. First off the food. From reading previous reviews I had decided to get the lobster  roll. Sadly when I looked at the menu today, there was no lobster roll. So I settled for the lobster ravioli which had a rich, creamy sauce, but a rather dry filling. It was good enough to finish. After my meal I ordered the Cafe Mocha for dessert. Please don't waste your money. First off there was no steamed milk in my mocha which was the first sign that something was off. Actually I take that back. The first sign that something was off was the very obvious chunks of hot chocolate powder used in lieu of real hot chocolate or chocolate syrup. This was by far the worst mocha I have ever had. I was so disappointed. Based on previous reviews, it appears that things have gone down at the Blind Pig. Now in regards to service. I walk in at about 2:30 pm and I'm not acknowledged and sat down until 2:50 pm. After that my waitress, who never introduced herself, was as scarce as possible. I had to actually go seek her in order to get my check. It was incredibly slow so there was no reason for the lack of service. That is never good. One last thing that stood out was the lack of professionalism. I could actually see one of the bartenders bright pink bra and instead of tending to the customers and moving food quickly waitresses were hanging out at the bar talking. Overall it was not bad enough to be featured on Kitchen Nightmares,  but I would not recommend this restaurant.",

The only time the server was at my table before dropping the check 20 mins after we were finished was to to take our order.. With only having maybe 3 other tables and having the manager clear our plates there was no excuse to leave us waiting so long for our check.. Specially when we were on our lunch break.

I really liked their fries, they were crisp and seasoned well. The lobster and crab sandwich was the perfect size, not too big and just enough to not feel overly full. I will definitely be back.",

While I'm not a fan of gravy, the crinkle cut fries reel me in. The first time we went, my husband had the burger and I had meatballs and yesterday he had the Ruben and I had the steak frites. Still can't complain. On Friday night when we were there, someone was having a party and they were moving tables around. We offered to move so they could set up. Not a big deal at all but the server gave us a free order of pork nuggets. What?! awesome! Overall, you just try this place. I cannot wait until we can go back!",

They offer fresh juices and quality dishes that are fresh. We ordered the poutine fries, the chicken Caesar salad, and a club sandwich. Everything was good except the salad was very light on the dressing and a bit on the small side. I would recommend the fresh juices as they are fresh and healthy. They have desserts and I have to recommend the chocolate croissant.",

It seems like just a deli/market when you first walk in, but they also have a full menu and a lounge on the other side.  I think you always order at the counter for food, but I am not sure.  I saw where someone else mentioned that you can order at the tables in the lounge.  So it was a little confusing because I left a tip at the counter and then had great service at my table and wasn't sure if I was supposed to tip again.  They didn't have prices on the market items yet.  The food was excellent.  I had the chopped salad which had great ingredients, but could have been chopped more for a chopped salad.  My son had the burger which was fantastic!  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I really liked the atmosphere in the lounge area and could really see it becoming a great hangout for locals.  They also have a parking lot in the front.  The is a great spot and I hope they do well!!!!",

I've come down here a few times to get dinner and have not yet been disappointed by the chef.  BP Porchetta is my go to...highly recommended.  That's not the reason why I'm 5 starring on yelp though... I was sitting at the bar and Brittany, the brunette bartender, was mixing up a drink that was very involved....lots of ingredients in it.  I was amused by the effort so I asked if I could try it.  I'm not a cocktail person and I was mainly just asking so that I could taste what a prepared Blind Pig cocktail tastes like.  Brittany is a kind bartender, so she gave me a bit of what she made.  It was not what I expected.  It was probably one of the best prepared drinks that I've ever had.  It's called a \"bad hair day\", and it's something that she created herself for the menu.  It's a very feminine drink, but I have to say that I appreciate the craft of the drink and the effort that went into it.  It was very smooth and something that I feel is deserving of recognition.    I'm a guy and would not order something like this on a normal occasion...but for any girls who read this post...or any guys who are ordering drinks for their date...I highly recommend Brittany's \"Bad Hair Day\".  Brittany-if you read yelp posts then here's your props.  Stop being so modest...you should be in the mixology competitions.",

Taco Tuesday offers steak, chicken or shrimp tacos. We had one of each. We also ordered Calamari which comes with a very thick Marinara like sauce that is nothing like I ever had. Delicious! Barbecue wings and pretzel bites are also great. Our server Amy was super nice and helpful. When I am nearby I will definitely stop in.",

Chicken fingers with hot buffalo sauce were absolutely delicious. The fries were perfect and the sauce was applied liberally.

    "text": "Absolute ripoff.  It's called blind pig because the waitresses and cooks are probably blind on the prices they quote on the menu and what ends up on the receipt.  They quote you a pizza for $14.99, then the bill comes to $27, they charge $1.50 for green peppers and each other topics. Then for deep dish style they charge extra $7.50 without telling you upfront.    My waitress forgot the ranch dressing, then another waitress who brought me the pizza, completely disappeared after I asked her for ranch also.  I waited 25 min for a low grade pizza which didn't even have thoroughly cooked tomatoes and green peppers, just a ton of melted mozzarella and an average dough.   It doesn't end there, they kept changing the games on Tv with a loud  treble sound that no seemed to care about.   Let me give all restaurant owners a little tip about customer service and finance, because there are a lot of trust fund babies that have no idea how businesses are ran.  If you provide a terrible service, then a loyal customer such as myself will never step foot here Again , which costs you $300-400 of lost sales a year, including any additional lost business from people who will change their mind after reading this Yelp review.   If you have unhappy workers or workers who smoke too much pot and forget to bring ranch or whatever else is asked, then you might want to ask yourself how long you will stay in business.  The food is mediocre at best, but for Vegas standards there are way better places for the price you pay.",

    "text": "This gastropub is located off the freeway in Las Vegas in a business district. Stopped in after a quick check of restaurants in the area.  Greeted promptly by staff, directed to a table, menus provided and beverage order offered to be taken. The waitress was cordial, personable, and attentive. We had several questions and requests to which she was able to accommodate.   We ordered the pork nuggets, poutine, and I ordered a BP burger. The food came out at a good pace from appetizer to meal.   The poutine was a nice balance of gravy, cheese and beer battered French fries. Not salty and not soggy was the poutine.   Pork nuggets seasoned and topped with peanuts in a sweet thai style sauce along with a nice dipping aioli. The pork belly used for the nuggets were tender and not fatty. The combination of dip, seasoning, and likes sound like they wouldn't mesh well.  Surprisingly it was worth.   The BP Burger I requested in medium was topped with arugula, cheese, tomato on nice soft roll. Choice of fries, salad, or upgrade to sweet potato. I elected the regular fries.   Burger was cooked as requested. Appropriately seasoned to the accompaniments. Cooked correctly. Juicy and flavorful. Fries were beer battered. Good on their own and or with some ketchup.  Others in my group ordered the au jus. From what I gathered it was good. Not the best. Needed more horseradish. Made daily. Wasn't the spiciest. The au jus was a good sweetness and juiciness for the meat. Not overly salty. The crunch roll was just right for the hearty amount of tender beef.   Bill settlement was quick and to the point.   Good: execution on the point of food. Most things are made as ordered. Inexpensive and great value compared to the area.  Bad: Just wish it was closer to the action of Vegas.  Other notes: weird bathroom napkin dispenser.   Would visit again.",

This restaurant is located in the bottom level of Panorama Towers and has a view of the strip. The small room is dimly lit and there are pig decorations everywhere. Not tacky pigs but cool pigs, if that can be possible.   Since there were three of us, we ordered a couple things to share. We started with Poutine and it was very good. I only had it one other time, in Canada and surprisingly this was way better! My friends liked the Pork Belly Nuggets but they weren't my favorite. I think pork belly is hit or miss because sometimes it is too fatty.  I shared the Speakeasy Steak Sandwich with my friend and it was delicious!! Their bread is super thick and amazing. I asked for extra mayo of course because that's how I like my cheesesteaks.   Overall, I think this is a cute place to hang out with friends. They had drink specials but I didn't pay attention since I don't drink but my friends seemed excited about them. There was only a couple people there for most of the time we were eating but a group came in as we were leaving. On the way out we checked out the store next door. Super cute. I think I want to live in Panorama Towers now!",

Conveniently located off the Strip, but still within an Uber/Lyft ride, this small upbeat restaurant feature a large bar area with comfortable seating.   Came in during the dinner rush for a couple drinks and appetizers and meals to go. Bartender was super nice and gave enough to talk/chat with company and still look through the menu. Wasn't too thrilled that the draft selection didn't go past 3, but the beers were good.   Minus 2 stars for the lack of good parking and that it always seems crowded even when there isn't that many people there. It seems to get real loud even when there isn't much chatter going on or the TV volume isn't even that high.  The food is good, I ordered the chicken marsala with french fries (hormonal cravings) and my boyfriend got a calzone. The chicken marsala was good, the sauce was rich and it went really well with the fries (I was probably craving poutine which is why I enjoyed this pair). My boyfriend did enjoy his calzone, he didn't have much to say about it other than it did its job to quell hunger.",

    "text": "I decided to finally check out The Blind  Pig with co-workers on our lunch break since we wanted to take a breather from our EDR. I ordered the BP Burger medium rare, and this first visit was perfect-medium rare like I ordered, everything served hot and fresh, totally excited to come back with the Wifey, so that's what I planned.  We came back the following weekend, and its literally night and day here, no joke. Dinner service here is a bit unorganized. First, there is no hostess stand, so we waited...and waited...until one of the workers came from behind the counter and told us to wait (yet again) until a spot opens up.  We were lucky enough to get a comfy booth, and we took advantage of the Yelp check in offer of a free cocktail. I got the Blind Pig and don't remember the name of Wifey's drink, but it had Proseco in it. both were okay. We decide on the Poutine as a starter and split the Blind Pig Burger. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed at the amount of tables she had for her station, and actually the floor manager ended up taking and delivering our drink orders.  Poutine was kinda skimpy on the cheese curds, and the blind Pig Burger which I had raved about wasn't as good as when I had it during my lunch visit, a little more medium than medium rare. I guess when the kitchen gets slammed at dinner time, food doesn't really come out as it should? I probably would just return for lunch where there's no crowds and you can probably enjoy your order much better. Oh, and our waitress never got out of her funk...she was either frazzled throughout the night, or just didn't feel like being there...ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  3",

Roast beef was well sliced and very flavorful 5oz portion.  At first I thought it was not going to fulfill my lunch hunger pains but I was wrong.  The au jus that accompanied the sandwich was very tasty with the perfect hint of salty flavor.    The french fries were a hit.  Seasoned style fried crispy with light a fluffy potatoes on the interior.  Very nicely done and a huge portion as well.  The meal is served with a dill pickle that was tasty but looked like it had been in the barrel for some time.    IF, you check in on Yelp you can have a complimentary beverage with a choice of juice, smoothie, or cocktail.  Being mid afternoon with a full day ahead I opted for the smoothie.  The Berry Smoothie was excellent with raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries all blended with yogurt. Another success!    I will visit The Blind Pig again and I think next time I will try the Steak Sandwich because of the employee recommendation.",

This place is excellent, so much so that we went twice during our stay.  The variety of food selections allows for everything from quick sandwiches up to perfectly prepared Italian fare.  The first night, we had ordered to-go, but opted instead to stay and eat.  The antipasto salad was delicious and the burgers are top-notch as well, as I've noted before, I'm a sucker for an egg on top of a burger, especially if pairs with thick-sliced bacon!  The second night, we decided to go with nice, slower paced sit-down.  Wow, what a good choice this was!  Full disclosure...there was a problem with one of our dishes and they went above and beyond to make it right and make absolutely certain we were happy with our meal in the end.  Do not visit here and neglect an opportunity to enjoy the Garlic Knots...you will regret that.  The pasta dishes were perfectly prepared and the portion size allowed for some leftovers (even for me).  Finally, the cannolis night-capped the meal and did not disappoint!  In short, take a chance, get a block off the strip behind Aria/Vdara and eat at The Blind Pig!!",

The calamari was pretty much a giant plate of breading, there wasn't much squid to be found. At first glance we were excited about the huge portion, come to find out it was all breading and very tiny pieces of squid that were over salted. We also ordered a steak salad, just some baby greens with cranberries, walnuts, and bleu cheese dressing. She asked how we would like our 'filet' cooked and we said medium. What was brought out was well done minced beef. And lastly our service wasn't that great either! The place wasn't busy at all, only one other table who seemed to just be drinking. The extra plate brought out was dirty with old food stuck to it. My water was never refilled till I asked at the end of the meal only because she was walking by. After our food was dropped off she never checked back till everything was finished and didn't pick up any of the plates. Sorry but this place was a bust!",

I saw that they had poutine and I had tried it once before at the Pig and the Pickle in Concord,CA and loved it and now whenever I see it on a menu, I have to try it. I'm so glad we had time to come back today and try this place. There was plenty of parking this time around, early Sunday morning. Walked in and immediately noticed the deep booths available and loved the nice touch of the added comfy pillows.  Loved the lighting, dark walls, pig heads and pig paintings. It all worked quite well together.  I didn't know what to expect when yelp said free drink just for checking in. Free drink ended up including any cocktail, coffee or smoothie. It being still early I went for the very berry smoothie. What a deal!  Previous reviews suggested trying the pork bites. I was conflicted. But, tasty pork won out over fries with cheese and gravy.   It didn't disappoint. Nice, fatty, fried pork pieces in a slightly spicy sweet sauce paired nicely with the creamy dipping sauce. The flavors and textures melded well together - it truly was a taste of heaven in my mouth. Service was spot on.  I will definitely come back and try the poutine next time.",

My food had to be on spicy sauce  it came plain when I ask the server what happened with my order he went to get a bowl and put hot sauce and told me that I could add it to my food or to use it as a dip sauce.

James O. felt a little rushed by the bartender, but I thought the service was just fine. Be sure to check-in on Yelp for a free speciality cocktail (or smoothie). It was a little frustrating that they were out of so many things. Straight away, the bartender informed us of at least 6 beers and 3 cocktails he couldn't do. And when I ordered by cocktail, he let me know he couldn't do that one either (so over half the cocktails were out). I settled on The Blind Pig cocktail, which was like a fancier cosmo - a good choice. The menu has several tasty items. But the reason we came was the poutine fries. I was a little afraid of being told they couldn't make it because they were out of something. But thankfully, we were able to order it. It was a sizable portion - definitely more than enough to share. And at $6.50, it seemed like a bargain. While tasty, it wasn't the best I've had. But I would certainly return and order it again. All in all, the menu and ambiance will have me coming back.",

I had to go back to work so I'm unable to bring it back. Such a disappointment I will definitely not be coming back.",

It's 9pm on a Saturday and they choose not to answer. It's ridiculous and is there no manager on duty? This has happened before too. They seem to make up their own hours and close when they want to work. I don't think it's crazy to expect someone to answer at 9pm when they are open until 10/11pm. The towers generate a lot of business. Imagine how much they would get if they actually answered the phone.",

The taste &quality of this burger could command a much higher price tag but is a steal at $12!!!IIt came with perfectly done sweet potatoe fries that you will not want to stop eating. They are thin,crispy & a portion big enough for 2t3 people. If you are a dessert lover & you are a red velvet connoisseur, the red velvet cake is to die for. The frosting is a cross between vanilla frosting &icecream..unlike anything I've ever tasted..It is heavenly!! The cook at Blind Pig used to be a chef at Mandaley Bay's \"Mix\" restaurant. He takes pride in his craft & the food reflects it. They are now starting to switch up dishes frim time to time, which is great so if you frequently dine here, you will have new dining surprises waiting for you. Blain was our server, total sweetheart. My water glass was neVer under half full & I average 5or 6glasses of water per meal. Excellent &attentive. I have no doubt the rest of the menu is as deliscious. Ill definately be back. Relaxed atmosphere with a take out/deli as well.",

Waitress was inattentive and ignorant of the menu items, and just generally did a bad job of things. At one point she was trying to open a bottle of wine and completely gave up after mauling the cork and causing bits of it to get in the wine, and went back to the bartender to open it. When we were ready to go, we asked to split up the checks or pay with different cards; we were then told by the waitress they only split it two ways. Sorry, no one really wants to foot a $300 bill! The manager came over and explained to us that it was too much of a hassle to split checks, and you have to manually split it in the billing app. Fucking seriously?! Coming over to customers paying $300 for service and saying providing said service is too much of a hassle?! None of us will be going there again.",

The ambiance is modern and relaxed, the staff is great, the drinks are amazing, and the food is delicious. Coming from the strip, the value for the price is excellent. I mean, if you want ridiculous value then go to Taco y Taco, but if you want value for high quality food then this place has that. My favorite dish is the shrimp and lobster mac 'n cheese, which is a full meal. On my third visit I had the pizza with the sausage, pepperoni, onions, and mushrooms (I don't recall the name) and it was very good. I see other reviews about the margarita pizza and I've heard the same, so I'm sure they'll fix it. They are new, so when you stop in ask, since they're in improvement mode. I don't even think they've had their grand opening yet. The mixed drinks are high quality and the bottled beer selection is a great mix of craft and specialty beers along with a few go-to beers if you're not a beer person. My advice, go there now; it's only a matter of time before you'll need to make a reservation or wait in line. I'll definitely go back on my next visit.",

    "text": "This is my third and probably the last time I'll come here. Appetite got so ruined by this time's tall waitress. I think her co-worker called her \"Vanessa\"? Yelp says \"Ambience: romantic\"?yeah, ONLY when a server does a DECENT or higher job and this chick ruined every ounce of it. There's something wrong with her one way or another. I usually let ill-mannerism and mistakes slide up to three times, because I understand that everyone forgets to do an attitude check or get overwhelmed by their day. It started from the moment we walked in. She was all the way at the far end of the restaurant just staring at us for a while AND THEN nodding her head sideways (to imply we should walk over there and save her any efforts). She didn't even ask if we wanted the perfectly available booth or any other table; out of the confusion from her silence and unmoved figure, we just sat down at the table closest to her since she was too lazy to walk towards us and with us. She did not act anywhere near similar to how the other servers (from my previous visits) had acted; heck, it's not even the way any DECENT waiter or waitress would act at any restaurant regardless of the type of dining place. She was not at all informative; partially because she chose to not be informed, herself. She made no efforts into explaining anything. My friend and I kept trying to ask her questions and she would ALWAYS disappear immediately without a care to let us FINISH saying what we were trying to say. Every time she was obligated to talk to us (probably to fool her co-workers into thinking she's even a decent waitress since she's so two-faced and LOUDLY asking how we were doing as if her volume was on purpose), she always acknowledged my friend and treated me like I was invisible. I had to keep trying to get her to look at me since I knew more about this place than my friend did and I knew how to word things more clearly and briefly than my friend did. Lady, I was trying to make your visits to our table easier FOR YOU. My friend didn't know what the heck he was trying to say to you and you constantly gave him your ear with an eager smile and bullshited response. Every time I tried to help him get to the point, you'd just give me a your constipated expression. If your selective hearing can't hear me, than just tell me to speak louder. If you don't know what we are trying to ask you, then ask us for more details and actually LOOK at what we were trying to show you on our tablet/smartphone (yelp app check-in offer) instead of constantly walking away prematurely. To add, she always talked to us from far away: from the counter, from the other tables, or while walking around..instead of taking just a LITTLE bit of more time to walk to our table and stand there like she should be. Whatever her reasons for being so rude and improper were, she had no right to keep it up for the WHOLE time I was there. It may be my imagination, but my observations find that she was biased towards people who obviously have money. For example: a nicely, but casually-dressed elderly white couple and, my 100% asian friend who looks 100% white and was dressed all spiffy in his button-up, vest, and fedora. Then, there's me, a 20-something Asian wearing no brand names and looks like a middle-schooler. I may be a student/Asian, but either way I'm not stereotypically stingy on tips in case you thought there was no point in treating me as an equal to my friend. By the way, I called this place a few hours prior and asked if they're usually busy Saturday evenings. They said no. So, it's not a solid excuse to say \"Vanessa\" was busy. There were plenty of other employees here. These two of five stars belong to: the chef and the awesome guy (shorter than vanessa) with the apron that always comes out of the kitchen. On my first visit, he was the amazing server for my table. He and the majority of servers from anywhere UNDERSTAND how SIMPLE it is to kindly tell a table that he will be back in a few minutes if he were ever too busy to spare us even a measly SINGLE minute ON-THE-SPOT. Guy-in-the-apron, I admire you for being professional on-the-job regardless of what bad things may be going on in your life or refraining from any favoritism towards patrons. That tip WE left was meant for the guy-in-the-apron. We kept it really small in case the sucky waitress wasn't required to split it amongst the group and got to keep it; she deserved zero tip after the 6+ moments of shitty service she gave. Speaking of which, she didn't give us time to finish asking for the check. We wanted it split. No matter how much I love the Poutine and the Crispy Pork Nuggets here, it's not worth coming back if the appetite is just going to get ruined to the point where WE can't taste anything. FYI, it was freaking delicious when we ate the leftovers HOURS LATER.",

One side is this little bakery area, and the other is the bar/lounge/restaurant. The seats are big and comfortable, and the Bloody Marys are tasty. I tried the lobster & shrimp sandwich, and it was really good. A lot of places that offer lobster anything usually skimp on the lobster meat, but this place doesn't. The sandwich was meaty and done very well.  Staff was great. Our waitress was friendly, funny, and attentive, making sure every drink was filled and we were happy.  Like I said, the atmosphere was great. It's a little off the beaten path, and it wasn't crowded (which was a good thing), but I would absolutely go back.  A really enjoyable dining experience, and a great \"hidden find\".",

    "text": "We have ordered from the Blind Pig many times, but the new menu selections are unappealing. My partner's favorite item on the former menu was the \"Blind Pig\" salad, but since it is no longer available, he ordered an Antipasto salad for pick-up. He said the new salad was loaded with high quality and delicious ingredients (the mozzarella and the meat), but it lacked an adequate amount of lettuce. I noticed this seems to be partly due to the fact that they are now using much smaller takeout containers (in plastic rather than the biodegradable choice they used to use). The process of picking up food was also confusing- it was unclear where to pick up the food, and there was no host at the podium. We hope our feedback is noted so that we can bring our business here in the future.",

The wings had just enough kick and the sauce for the pretzels was so creamy cheesy delicious.  Next time I'll be getting the pizza as the table across us ordered and if I wasn't already stuffed I would have got as well!!  The Blind Pig is one of Vegas's best kept secrets.

I heard their cocktails were good so I was super excited to try them out. Kinda pricey but I think it's worth it. I got Growing Apples and Sunny Day. They were both amazing and probably would be super dangerous if you keep drinking them. They taste like candy!   The food was great. We got the pork belly appetizer to start with. The glaze on the meat was amazing. Perfect mix of fat and meat. So yummy that we ordered a second plate! For my meal, I got the ahi tuna Asian crunch salad. It was sooo refreshing. I loved it.  The service was good. They were super attentive and everyone was nice. I'm definitely coming back again! I also wanna try the stuff they have in the market area too!",

    "text": "Ooh this place is so un-Vegas and I love that about it. First of all, it's in the bottom of the Panorama towers. Location is ok because it's by the strip, but not subject to the parking and walking issues of LV Blvd. Walking up, it almost feels like you're in a regular city! Would be a bonus if it were on a high floor, to get a view. There are two sides: the restaurant/bar side, and a fast/takeout side. It was pretty late when we arrived so the takeout side was already closed.  We sat at the bar where the 'tender was friendly enough, but realized that we were in conversation and pretty much left us alone. The specialty cocktail list is pretty good, with vodka, gin, rum, whiskey and tequila drinks. Each is $10, so I think that's a pretty good 'specialty' price. The beer list has some interesting gems on it, with costs from $5-15. Plus points for having a 'draft brew of the week' for $5 each. I confess that I didn't try the food yet, but I just loved the atmosphere and concept so much that I really want to return. And I want it to survive, which seems like it might be difficult in this location. I hope it does! Oh yeah and I almost forgot to mention that kids are totally welcome here!",

What's the harm right?  After blasting over to Sample the piggies - well above the speed limit, I was pleasantly impressed with the look feel and ambiance. I guess I was expecting a dive but it was upscale and perfect for a quick bite.  Service was great, unfortunately it took too much time get our order delivered. 30 mins...    I ordered the nuggets and they were awesome. Crispy crunchy on the outside and melt in your mouth buttery on the inside. The fat was rich and a tad too much fat for my liking. Sweet n sour sauce complimented the nuggets. Great combo. Not a big fan of the Russian sauce that came along with the nuggets.  I ordered the Blue Cheeseburger and it was a little better than OK. I've had better. Is it worth a revisit, yes. So minus 1 for service and another minus 1 for the burger. They get a 3 Star.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try The Blind Pig since we moved here 3 yrs ago. We were going to a show at Tropicana so I looked up restaurants near by and The Blind Pig popped up!  We were able to make reservations which was great and when we arrived we were seated in a comfy booth on the bar side. The decor was great. A lot of TV'S I am assuming it is a big game day hot spot. Which we aren't huge sports fans so it was a little disappointing that the sound for the basketball game was on and not just playing and silent with music playing instead. Had we sat more on the restaurant side or even outside on the patio it would have been the same since there were TV'S everywhere you looked.  That is the only reason I gave a 4 and not a 5. As far as everything else...service, food, drinks...perfect! We ordered the hot artichoke and spinach dip with chips to start and 2 rum and pineapples. The dip was hot and packed full of more artichoke hearts than spinach which is rare...normally other way around. So off to a good start :) my man ordered the Italian beef sandwich with fries and a side salad. I ordered the fish of the day which was halibut with a lemon caper sauce and veggies on the side...broccoli and potatoes...or I could have had sauteed spinach...and I also ordered a side salad...I wish I hadnt...the side salads were so big we could have shared one. So most of mine went to waste.  My man said that his sandwich was good but he hoped for more seasoning...but the meat was really tender. They serve the best meat here Boar's head...anything you order sandwich wise is going to be delicious. I truly feel that is the best meats around.  My halibut was cooked to perfection...it was a really nice piece of fish. The sauce was yummy, nice and citrusy. There was mushrooms in the sauce which I don't care for but they were big enough I could easily pick them off.  I am glad I got the broccoli and potatoes...the potatoes were perfectly grilled, crispy on the outside and soft on the outside and they were seasoned well.  Our waitress was very attentive and made sure we were good to go and very friendly!  We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "NOTE: If you are planning to visit, be aware that this establishment is under new management with a new menu that has done away with many of the dishes other reviews praise (lobster mac and cheese, poutine, pork nuggets). I also didn't see the pastry case or \"pantry\" shop area earlier reviews mention. I suggest focusing on the most recent reviews.  Came in for a weekday lunch with Bethany E. I dig the masculine lounge feel of the place and like that we were able to snag a cozy booth for our visit. Staff were attentive and the food was okay. Menu is still several pages but what we ordered didn't wow- spinach artichoke dip was thin but tasty, and better with the bread basket than the tortilla chips, but neither of us finished our sandwiches. My eggplant parm was okay, but a little boring. Side salad was just mixed greens and Italian dressing, but it was a good dressing with fresh oregano.   I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come back, but I do hope this spot finds it's niche.  Nothing was actually bad, but it was very average. They either need to bring back the items that previous customers loved, or redo the menu to focus on better execution.  PET PEEVE: The parking lot is small, and they have the majority of spaces blocked off for valet. If I wasn't meeting someone here that would have turned me off enough to dine elsewhere. It's completely unnecessary, especially for weekday lunch.",

There doesn't seem to be much parking as most of the spaces directly in front were roped off for valet.  There is plenty of seating on both sides of the restaurant.  The booths are very comfy accented with pillows.   We decided to start with the Spinach & Artichoke dip.  For me it was too watery.  It was almost as if the artichokes were from a can and they didn't drain the excess.  I really enjoy my dips to be more creamy.  The have a great bread basket so I would suggest using that bread instead of the tortilla chips that come with it.  I ordered the Philly with fries.  The sandwich had a good flavor.  Wonderful amount of meat and veggies packed in.  The bread used was really good as well.  A little crisp on the outside with a soft center.  The fries were just ok but could have been cooked a little longer.  If you're in the area it's an ok lunch stop but I wouldn't drive out of my way for it.",

I don't blame her though. It wasn't very busy, about 10 customers I total, but the waitress pretty much had to take care of everything and seemed overwhelmed. I also asked her about a food option, in which she responded with \"if it's not in the menu, then we don't have it\". I feel like she could have been nicer about it.  Food: I ordered the steak sandwich, which was good but the bread was very hard. I also ordered the fettuccine carbonara which was pretty overall. It was creamy and the shrimps taste good with it.

Don't expect for the waiter to offer you an ice water.  After ordering drinks, which were quickly down the pie hole [It's the desert, I was thirsty]  we received our appetizer - we rated it a 3 ( once again it's the desert - put it together ) A napkin would have been nice - so I can clean off my whiskers.   I patiently waited 5, 10, almost 15 minuets for my empty glass to be refilled with the delicious drink they first brought me. I promise,  I'll pay for the drinks. Note to self: order two next time.  The food has arrived and man does it look amazing.  The Lemon chicken on point!  Perfect 5 out of 5!!   My partners dish - of which I took only a few bites (so maybe the rating is not as fair)  5 our of 5!  Fresh, refreshing and lite.  Perfect for this desert setting!  We have finished the meal and ready to get the party moving.  \"Where the hell is the waiter at with my bill!\" No just kidding,  let's just walk to the register and ask for a \"to-go-box\" and pay for this 5 star meal with a 2 star service.   :)",

I love the brick walls, art, pigs, color palette, etc.  Light too bright over booths, felt very cafeteria-ish. I would dim those down some. Tables at the booths were a little small also. My back started hurting because I couldn't sit all the way back and eat over the table. I was hunched over most of the time.  Service is so-so. A little more education on the menu items and customer service would do some wonders.   All in all, it's worth the trip to try the burger :)",

Blind Pig is a cute lounge/bar/cafe in a weird part of town (too far from the strip for tourists, too out of the way for locals). It seems like a good chunk of their customers come from the high rise next door.  Parking was not a problem when we went (Sunday 7PM), however I can see it being a problem if they were busier. The Blind Pig is NOT in the high rise next door, don't accidentally drive into their lot!  You get a free cocktail/coffee/smoothie with Yelp check in (Sorry, no beer). However, we were told that they were in the process of \"changing their cocktail menu,\" thus didn't have the ingredients to make any of the cocktails on the menu. We asked if we could substitute it for a beer- told no, asked if they could make us a cocktail with whatever ingredients they had- told no. Hope that issues been resolved! We ordered the white sauce pizza- really, really good! The poutine portion was HUGE for the price. It was perfect big group food!  I would come back, but it's just so out of the way......",

This is a good option if you want something off the strip that is quiet. This on the opposite spectrum of Lavo's champagne brunch. No need to dress up or put makeup on. There were only two other patrons occupying the bar. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and it was okay. It was definitely cheesy but lacked the lobster bits. Restaurant is under new management so the yelp check in 1 free beverage is no longer being honored. The decor is really nice and dark. The booths are like VIP club booths. This the perfect place place to come while hung over since it's nice and dark.",

We continued to go inside and it was empty on a late Friday night. Ambiance was cute though. This is a WARNING! You get a free cocktail/drink when you check in on Yelp. They had their holiday special cocktail drink and lets just say luckily it was free because it tasted terrible! it was either too sweet or tasted like medicine. Obviously the bartender did not know how to mix drinks at all. They messed up my friends \"red headed slut\" drink the bartender had added Redbull and my friend had to coach the waiter to tell the bartender to never ever have Redbull in a red headed slut. The only thing i enjoy was the Seared Salmon.. to me it was great. To my group of friends they ordered the Bootlegger Strip Steak (dry even ordered it on Medium),  'Speakeasy' Steak Sandwich (dry),  Shrimp and Lobster Roll (nothing special), Blind Pig Chopped (plain) and Stozzapretti Pasta (was okay).",

Tom, and Stacy and Natalia, and Roberto, and Ricardo, and Karen took SUCH good care of us! The peach salad, the garbage insalata, the eggplant Parmesan, the rigatoni ala vodka, the cheesecake, the scotch, and the wine... AMAZING! We will enjoy another meal here as soon as we can!

The service is getting worse and the Alfredo now taste like it's from a bottle. Very inconsistent and I have to say it's getting worse.

We all ordered a round of drinks, bloody Mary's, micheladas and beers. All were great and refreshing. We also ordered their clams in sauce and calamari. Both were AHHHMAZING! The clams and the sauce and bread, delicious and fresh. The calamari was nice and crispy and the battered was perfect. I got the BnJ (I think that's the name) burger and added a fried egg. It definitely hit the spot and was huge!! I saved the other half for road. Our friends went with linguine and shrimp, Alfredo and shrimp and burgers. The pricing isn't that bad either, we all had two rounds each and we were a party of 6 and the bill came out to $280 with gratuity. The Blind Pig was definitely a good place to get our last meal in Fabulous VEGAS! Alicia is also a great server and has great customer service!!",

She would stop by frequently to check on us, even after the food was served.  A work colleague of mine split an enormous Salmon Panini and they served it to us as two separate entrees.  We really appreciated them doing that for us.  See pics   Value: 3.0 out of 5.0 Our crew's breakdown: $9.99 = Grilled Ham/Cheese or Turkey Club Sandwich.  Both came with a side salad.  The monster sized salmon panini was $11.99 and easily fed two. Bruschetta was at $7.99 and bottomless drinks at $3.00  Food: 4.0 out of 5.0.  I can speak only on behalf of the Salmon Panini which was tasty and a large portion.  The Honey Mustard dressing was amazing.  I should have asked if that was made in-house or purchased.  Very tasty  Ambiance: We sat outside this visit as the weather was nice but we've eaten inside and the booths are spacious and comfortable.  The tables are spaced appropriately and there are flat screens to watch sporting events.  The bar looks well stocked with high end booze and craft beers.  Looks like a great place to stop by for happy hour.    Summary:  We've stopped by there for lunch 3 times and all visits resulted in a good lunch that got us out quickly.  Food and staff have always been solid and I'll have to visit for dinner and happy hour one day.",

    "text": "Ok so a year ago I went Pescatarian but knew if I was ever gonna slip up and eat red meat it would be because the food was worth so here I am visiting a spot that I couldn't leave vegas without having my usual steak sandwich. Stepped in the joint and noticed things had changed around, I commented to the cashier and said well I hope the food is the same she didnt say anything and I should have taken that as warning. Food was sooo average and not worth it. The steak is more like a philly and bread was hard previously it was delightful fluffy ciabatta roll. When  I went back in to ask did I order the wrong thing?! She stated no things changed and then she should have offered to give me money back. So now I feel a certain way about the customer service. They were polite but if they would have said it changed prior I probably would have checked reviews and then said cancel my order.  I edited my previous review from 2 years ago and gave it 4 stars thought for a minute and wondered how were the rating still so high and thats when i went back and noticed I wasn't the only one so now Ive came back and it gets a 1. Like how do you change something sooo good. Yelp should require new ownerships to start fresh. I was going to contact them through their website but there is no contact form sooo  \\_()_/  food is nasty we want the old owners back or at least the old food.",

We decided to family style a bunch of dishes. Lobster mac and cheese, pork belly nuggets, seared ahi tuna, seared salmon, bootlegger steak and poutine. Everything was crazy good. Dishes were cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and executed well. The meats tasted fresh, tender and nicely done. And a large drink menu that boasted more than I knew what to do with!  Now, what's my gripe?  Service.  If it was any more terrible, we would've needed to call the police because we were not going to pay our bill.  Our server didn't check on us and HELD OUR FOOD IN THE KITCHEN until everything was lukewarm. We were starving so unfortunately, we didn't do anything about it. She never cared if we had water or drinks or had food. We were 1 of 4 current tables. She was watching a sports game.  If it wasn't for the food, I probably would've thrown a fit right then and there.  So come for the drinks, stay for the food but make sure you have adequate time and patience because I was about to get the dishes from the kitchen myself!",

Something about this calzone put me off.  There was a chemical taste.  I couldn't tell if it was from the dough or the filling but it was there.  It tasted like something was very processed rather than fresh.  Also, the wait staff, a young lady, was spending more time socializing at the bar than waiting on my table.  I sat for 15min waiting for my check and when I got it I had to wait again for someone to pick it up.  Again, the staff was having fun socializing at the bar, I had to go up to the bar to tell them I was ready to leave. I thought of leaving no review but this experience seemed to linger.  Glad I got this off my chest.",

When we were there, we were the largest group, taking up a long table right when you walk in, with other patrons in a couple other booths and at the bar.   The large group size (10) might have contributed to a small mix-up on drink orders, but it wasn't something that couldn't easily be fixed. Also, I don't know if it's the late-night ambiance but it was suuuuuper dark in there. Like hard to read the menu dark. Like I said, I'll have to come back for a proper meal, but it was a good enough place to grab a drink with friends.",

    "text": "Considering how empty the Blind Pig was during the Brunch hour, it left me feeling skeptical about the food. Located right next to the 15 Freeway are some new developing stores in Las Vegas.   Ambiance (4.5 Stars): I love the decor and ambiance in the Blind Pig. It is a mixture of old style furniture with gold and black color scheme that gives off an elegance that you don't often get at many brunch places. There is a bar area, individual tables, and sofa seating areas that are very comfortable. The World Cup soccer match was on near the bar are and we were able to watch the games from our table.  Food (4 Stars): I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Asparagus and Crab/Shrimp; the dish was beautiful and tasty too! The hollandaise sauce was super buttery and complemented the seafood. There was also a side of potatoes that gave you a nice break from the richness of the eggs. The english muffin was crispy and not too soggy either. I would order this dish again.  We had meatballs as an appetizer and it was basically some large croutons with meatballs in tomato sauce. It was okay and the meatballs were pretty dry, but the sauce was yummy and wasn't overly sweet.  Service (4 Stars): The service here was interesting. There is always a waiter coming by the refill your water cup, that I could appreciate. Our waiter gave us the wrong menus to order from and we had to switch up some of our orders. It was an honest mistake and I could see that they were trying their best fix the situation. It was just kind of awkward.   Bottom line: Compared to other places off the strip for brunch, this place is high up there. Good service and decent food.",

    "text": "I'm a fan boy of Block 16 (the parent company of Blind Pig) so maybe I'm a little biased, but so far I've loved just about every concept they've developed. Located in the Panorama Tower condo complex, Blind Pig is part convenience store, part bar and bistro. In the dining area you'll find plenty of comfortable seating, especially the booths, set amid a retro-chic prohibition era decor with views of City Centre across the highway.  The menu, as Block 16 is apt to do (see the Barrymore and Public House at the Venetian), features their modern take on approachable comfort food crafted with excellent ingredients. Always a sucker for pork, the crispy pork nuggets ($10) were a great way to start my meal. Unctuous, savory, deep fried cubes of pork covered in crispy skin were complimented with a sweet chili glaze and sriracha aioli that provided a bit of heat. That was followed by a porchetta ($13.50) sandwich with rich, but too oily, pork loin and belly in a crispy ciabatta roll.  Desserts are available, but they come straight from the cases and displays of the 'Provisions' side of Blind Pig. I should have let the coconut cake warm up a bit, but my sweet tooth couldn't be denied. The cake was stiff, as was the icing, but the flavors were very good. Next time, I'll have to resist the urge and wait to eat desserts at home. With their cases stocked with ready made and ready to cook products, there's plenty here for those wanting meals to-go.",

As much as my group enjoyed the decor, we were not sold on the food and drinks we ordered.  The Swedish Ginger I ordered was a tasty take on a Moscow Mule, but the drinks my friends ordered were basically the size of a shot and way too sweet.  For $12 a pop, the drink better be good.   Our server was very friendly.  Service was attentive, too attentive, in fact.  I always feel like such a jerk when I get annoyed at being checked on every 5 minutes, but you know what I mean.  If you ask someone 3 times if they are okay after finishing dinner and they always say YES!, you really do not need to ask a 4th time.  All told, nothing I had would make me venture this close to the strip, but if you're in the neighborhood, it might be worth checking out.",

The menu says it comes with hasbrowns but it didn't. Apparently they dont have hash browns and gave a different potato instead.   The bloody mary was good but nothing special. I appreciate that they have bleu cheese olives in it.  Took forever for me to get my check even after they took my plate. Overall, don't come here if you are in a rush.",

It's like an explosion of flavors once you take a bite! It's so good you don't even want to eat your fries! It's so good it doesn't need any other items to compliment the burger! The blind pig burger was cooked just the way I wanted it and every bite I took just melted in my mouth! The beef was so juicy! The bacon was nice and thick. The best part was it was not messy burger! Pick it up and go at it! This burger has a distinct taste that I cant put my finger on it but you will remember the taste. You may even dream about it lol.  The restaurant itself had a nice feel to it. I came during lunch so it wasn't busy. They have a full bar and a few TV's to watch sports etc. The atmosphere feels positive and elegant. It's a nice place to sit and enjoy lunch.   The price is a bit on the pricer side but after the service you receive and the food you eat it more that makes up for the cost. Sometimes I feel weary about spending so much for a burger but I'll tell you this at the end of the day price wasn't even on my mind. All I kept thinking about was how tasteful the burger was and how nice the staff was.   I returned 1 week later and the same girl was working the counter. She remembered me! That made my day. Whenever someone acknowledges that they remember you it also shows to me that they pay attention and don't treat customers as just a number. I had a great conversation with her when I arrived.   I will definitely make my way back here so I can try out their other items on the menu!   Don't miss out! Go get yourself a BP Burger now!!!'",

Brick walls adorned with a train set on one end of the place and a stuffed Boar hanging on the other. Edison lights hang over the bar area, and two gold old fashioned cash registers are on display behind the bar. Above are two hanging pieces of tin lined ceilings. The booths are comfy while there are some tables set up in the middle of the lounge as well. Onto the food.  It is set up like a service counter, you order your food, then go sit down. Available at the counter are some pre made items, like salads and sandwiches. Also a refrigerator that has some pre made items prepared by the chefs and frozen so you can take to go and prepare later, as well as some McConnell's Ice Cream pints. They have a small provision area that kind of reminds me of Resnick's Grocery downtown, I guess if you lived in the Panorama and had a hankering for a hostess treat, this would be convenient. They also have outside seating, but might get a little loud, it faces Dean Martin and I-15.   We wanted to grab a couple items and share, there were so many that stuck out, but we decided on Poutine, which is a favorite of mine. Fries were crinkle cut, that reminded me of my childhood and the Ore-Ida fries that was a household staple. Gravy had good flavor, I just wish there was a little more cheese curds. Crispy Pork Nuggets were really good, small portion, as it is an appetizer and if you ate any more, you might as well drive yourself to the nearest hospital and have your arteries unclogged. Then we shared the Shrimp and Lobster Roll, as crazy as it sounds, the old bay mayo and the fancy hot dog bun it came on really made this sandwich.   I was too full to try dessert, but the monkey bread and the PB&J bar looked delicious. They serve Illy coffee as well as fresh squeezed juices and smoothies.  Definitely will be coming back to check out the vibe of this place at night.",

We ordered many dishes and sampled from one another. The lobster mac and cheese was light yet rich; the pasta shells were large (not macaroni) and prepared slightly past al dente - perfect. The seared tuna was so buttery and served on a bed of Mediterranean orzo. The roasted pork sandwich was so flavorful and tasty. The lobster roll was simple but so good; it was filled with a generous amount of meat, the mayo dressing wasn't too much, and the bun was perfectly toasted. The burger was a grass fed beef patty topped with Gruyere and garlic aioli btwn a sesame bun.   We came in for an early lunch and were a little hesitant bc the place was nearly empty. The decor is best described as an upscale cafe with a romantic steakhouse vibe. The staff is super friendly and the service is very attentive.   10/10 would recommend   Pros: awesome food that is light yet filling, great operating hours Cons: none",

    "text": "Staying in the condos within walking distance I decided to have dinner here instead of having to brave The Strip. I might have had better luck there unfortunately. It was pretty quite on a Tuesday late night but there was one group of trust fund kids at the bar that made it their goal to own the room. Yelling like this was the coolest frat party they've ever been to. I don't want to blame the staff but I kinda do. Decide if you want your place to be a wild club or a restaurant. I could tell the other customers were not too amused with the dinner theater.     The food was okay but for the price range I expected a little more. $18 lamb chops were a little dry but the seasoning was good. Potatoes were a little over cooked but not terrible. It's not a meal I would send a postcard home about. Beer choice was okay.   The waitress was super sweet but I just don't think I would ever come back here hoping things are better the next time around. It's not the Vegas gamble I want to take.",

    "text": "Again this was recommended from the bartender at the Barrymore.   We were excited to visit once we saw the menu. It was during ConExpo and we had clients with us from NYC. Luckily we cabbed it over *never ever drink and drive in Vegas!* because there was zero parking in front.   You enter though the \"deli\" section of the restaurant - more on that later and then off to the side is the bar/restaurant portion.   Total Fail: the seating is awful. The choices are tables with tiny armed seating OR squished booths. 2 people of our party were well over 6'5\" and the booths just didn't work. The only waitress in the place was either clueless or had never seen tall or chubby folks before because when asked if they had armless chair she just shrugged and walked away to continue the chat we interrupted upon entering. The bar would have been an option but there weren't 4 seats together. We solved our issue by - wait for it. Removing the extremely large table from the booth and replacing it with the smaller but more accessible table from the center.   Not one person stopped us.   So NOT fatubulous!   The ambiance:  trying to ignore the above issues, it's a very pleasant looking space. I mean when you over look the interstate running right outside, you get a nice view of the backside of Harmon tower before it falls down.   The Drinks: Short. and expensive. *see attached photos of the bloody mary* - we had 3 rounds x 4 - $138.00   The Food: We just ordered appetizers since our waitress was basically non-existent so busy flipping her hair that one of our group actually had to go to the bar to order another round of drinks & get food menus.   Pork Nuggets: genius! Perfection. (3 orders)   Meatballs:  all were good but it would have been nice to know which ones were which.. pork/chicken/veal - all slathered in a tasty sauce but couldn't tell the difference in the meats. It could have been 80% beef and I wouldn't know because the sauce made them delicious. (3 orders)   Chicken Wings:   The only thing I'm going to say about this is that it was an ample serving. After the 1st one we packed them up to go. They tasted much better cold.   Service: There were 2 bright spots in the service: 1 was the 'busboy' who brought out our meatballs & was willing to at least ask the chef which was which. (and turns out, couldn't determine that either)  & the counter girl in the provisions section. She was extremely nice & helpful when we were leaving.   Otherwise it was a total fail. The one waitress working was attached by an invisible bungee cord to the end of the bar where she was animated & giggling at every word the 2 guys seated there & the bartender said. On the few occasions when she bothered to come over - she was surly and downright rude. I mean how dare we interrupt her social swish.   Total bill:  3 rounds of drinks & appetizers 219.00. *and yes we left standard tip just to show we are better than her service*   It's really too bad as we have a friend to lives next door in the Martin and it would be a great spot to meet up for lunch or cocktail hour.  He too is 6'6\" and quite frankly wouldn't be bothered trying to fold himself into the booths/chairs currently available.   Of the Block 16 places we've tried (and you can read our reviews of LBS, Holsteins, Barrymore, and Pinks etc) this is a huge disappointment for us. As a local, I'd never go there again. Can it be sustained on just the tenants of the Panorama & Martin? Maybe. Time will tell.",

    "text": "I have wrote a review recently on the Blind Pig with such promise to its new ownership and renovations, but I must say its awful. This place used to be wonderful, and it's gone straight to the gutter. I miss the market terribly and so do other residents for the Panorama. The food has tasted \"cheaper\" and the service has fallen greatly. Not to mention their new management is rude and doesn't look out for their workers. I have seen their staff eating on the floors or under the stairwell of the garage, that's ridiculous! One employee told me that \"it's either here or the floor in the kitchen.\" Being a bar owner myself I'm appalled at this new ownership. It's always a shame when something good goes sour. As the saying goes, it it's not broke don't fix it.  As a result, I will never be returning to The Blind Pig and will take the short trip down the street to Johnny Rockers for now on. This place might as well just name to the Pig because that's what they are. You have lost your loyal customer for over 2 years.",

They still charged us and refused to take it off the bill saying the side cost 1$ (they charged us $1.25).   I could care less about $1, just honor what you tell your patrons.

We got menus and then realized we are probably waiting close to 10 minutes with out anyone helping us. We were on a time crunch and hungry so it became alittle frustrating. The weird thing is once we realized we had been waiting quite a while we looked for servers or bussers and there was no one to be found. Finally a girl came over too our drink and app orders.   We got the gravy fries and the pork nuggets to start. Fries were sooo good!!! The pork nuggets I could have gone with out. The rest of the food was pretty good I got the BP burger and my sister got the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster Mac was good not nothing super special. I wish I had gotten a pizza it looked so good when I saw another table order it.   Lastly, we waited for someone to come clear our plates, package up leftovers and get the check. This took  a long time just like before.   So all is all...   Service was okay  Food was good  Environment was great  Prices were very good.",

How do you charge $8 for a domestic beer (Shock Top and Fat Tire) when other domestic beers on the menu are $5.50(BUd Light)?  This place will do well but alcohol prices are way to high to compete with the strip.  If they want to get locals to come a few days a week the alcohol prices will need to drop.  I have spoke too many people who live in Panorama Towers and The Martin and the all agree!!!! My advise take care of the locals and they will take care of you, if you get greedy on prices you will lose a local following which will hurt your business much more.  Food is priced well and the place is great just hoping they figure it out before its too late!!!",

However, after receiving my meal I was astounded at the quality of food and excellent craftsmanship of my old fashion drink.  First my burger, I ordered the signature burger as I often do as a bench mark for a first visit. The burger was prepared perfectly and the marriage of flavors was astounding, possibly the best in Vegas.  After being dazzled by the myriad of fine whiskies on their bar shelves, I resolved to test the bar maids abilities. I use the old fashion as a benchmark for drinks as it is somewhat simple but often made poorly by morons posing as mixologists. Once again I was sent reeling at the unfathomable excellence of the cocktail I had just sampled. The vast knowledge and competence of the bar maid \" Melissa\" certainly exceeds that of the finest in the area. A True connoisseur and a master in the art of fine beverage mixology. Overall, I must recommend this restaurant to any person who appreciates good food and fine drinks.",

Ordered the BP Burger which was great - grass fed beef really helped with the flavor. It came with a small side of coleslaw. For $12, it was a B+ in my book.  For $3, I also got a square of the coffee cake. It was really good! Grade: A  Second time: I decided to order a pizza - the BP Classic. For $15, I'd give it a grade of B. That price is kind of meh.. (Domino's anyone??) haha. However, if you are desperate for pizza, it isn't bad.",

Aesthetically, similar to dope speakeasies in NYC/DTLA-dimmed lighting, leather booths, and taxidermies.  Came in for a quick drink and I have to say, we were quite impressed.  Had the Bitter Sling which tasted like a toned down Manhattan; make sure to opt for ice cubes for fuller flavor.  Decided to give the poutine and crunchy pork chunks a try.  Surprisingly, both were delicious.  Will come back for their shrimp & lobster Mac n' cheese at a later time though.  Overall, The Blind Pig is a great addition for quick lunch and special occasions.  Too bad this place can be pricey so I can't be here as much as I'd like to.  Also, their market needs a little more work.  Nonetheless, good start for Las Vegas!!",

It took them 45 mins and the place wasn't busy at all. People before us sat, ordered, and got their food in 10mins while my daughter and I waited for our food. The manager kept apologizing for the for the wait. It was ridiculous! Making a little kid wait that long?! Nobody seems to care. My daughter asked if we can just go to In N Out since it was taking so long. I was considering it, but the waitresses and manager said it will only be a few more minutes. Didn't know a few more minutes was 45 mins?! It's not a kid friendly place. They purposely make you wait longer if you have kids.",

I ordered mozzarella wedges, chopped salad and chicken parmesan. I also ordered what I thought was chocolate mousse. Delivery was well within the time frame provided and the delivery guy was polite and quick. All the food was packaged well (with Italian, this is always a factor to me). Only problem, no utensils and no salad dressing. Bummer. The mozzarella was still hot and marinara clearly homemade. I tried the salad with no dressing and it had so many toppings, it wasn't bad. I bet the dressing would really have made it. The chicken parmesan was good and the linguine was served on the side - also good. It wasn't as warm as I would have hoped, but I had to go search for utensils. I'm saving the cake since it surprised me. I thought it was mousse but it was chocolate layer cake. Will try tomorrow.",

    "text": "One of the latest restaurants to open is The Blind Pig inside Panorama Towers. You can spot the restaurant from the I-15 it is accessed on Dean Martin Drive ample parking is available out front. Inside, you're met with a deli to your right and lounge to the left. My brother and I came in to dine for lunch. You order at the counter, you're given a number and your food is brought to you over in the lounge. The Deli seemed promising, it reminded me of a petite version of those I love in San Diego and San Francisco. You feel like you're transported into a speakeasy when you step over to the lounge. There is a large bar, oversized booths and table seating.   The menu offers a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas and entrees that include pasta, poultry or seafood. They also serve breakfast, though, I'm not sure when its available. My brother chose the Pastrami Rueben ($9.50) with coleslaw and I had the BP Porchetta sandwich with potato salad ($13.50). After a short wait, our lunch was served.  The Rueben was decent. The pastrami is sliced thin and possibly tossed on the griddle since there were crisp edges. The bread was dry, but the Russian dressing was quite good. Better than most Thousand Island dressings. The coleslaw went uneaten, it was too sweet for both of our tastes.   The Porchetta sandwich sounded great in theory, but the execution was poor. The greens were limp and slimey. The nuggets of pork belly and pork loin tumbled out from the bread with every bite. The pork loin was tender and had great flavor. I wish it were thinly sliced instead and piled high; it would make for a tasty sandwich. I enjoy pork belly when the fat is properly rendered. It was unfortunate that more than half of the nuggets were tough and filled with flubber. I found those pieces inedible. As a general rule, I do not like potato salad. Majority contain mayo and mustard; my least favorite condiments, this was no exception. I'd prefer alternate options to potato salad and cole slaw since both contain mayonnaise. My sandwich and iced tea was $18. I left hungry. Needless to say, I won't be rushing back to The Blind Pig, but I may return to try other menu items because the location makes it a very convenient lunch option.",

It would fit perfectly in a hipster, brick building downtown neighborhood.  Instead of being a bit \"middle of nowhere\" next to a highway. (as far as a non-local sees)  We had meatballs for appies.  Have to say I can't tell the ingredients (beef, pork and veal) but they were not terrible either.  We ordered two sandwiches:  Chicken Ciabatta and BP Porchetta.  They were decent and flavorful, though the Porchetta was on the salty side.  Their other half of the establishment is a deli / bakery section, which offers a decent selection of desserts or other grab-and-go items.  We liked the PB&J Bar and the Pecan Pie Bar we got!",

We ordered using the Yelp app. I was told it would be ready in 20 minutes, but I left early. Due to a road closure I got there just before it was supposed to be ready. The hostess went and checked and it was not ready. I waited for another 22 minutes. During which I was told the chops weren't ready.  I was annoyed and there were no real apologies.   Pork Chop - this was the miss. The flavor of the crust was good, but it was tough and dry. Overcooked. Damn.  The cook may have needed to stop when I asked about my meal the first time.   The broccoli and potatoes that came with the chops were great. So that helped.   My wife got he Grilled Shrimp and stated that they were great. She was happy and the spinach it came with was perfect.   Now the biggest highlight and the saving grace were the garlic knots. They were awesome. Simple and wonder flavor.   I hope that the chef was having a bad night with the chops because other than that everything else was good.",

I ended up getting something off their regular drink menu, the no sleep 'til Brooklyn. It tasted like a sweet cough medicine. I don't recommend it but at least it was strong!   We got 2 orders of poutine, one with pork belly nuggets (+$3) and one without. If you like fried, crunchy, fatty pork I say pay the extra charge but I enjoyed it without just the same! This was the whole table's favorite part of the meal! It's so simple but they do it just right. For my main course I got the BP burger- gruyere cheese, bacon, arugula and garlic aioli. It's basically a fancier spin on the classic bacon cheeseburger. Not bad but a little greasy.   I will be coming back here solely for the poutine! *drools",

    "text": "I finally got to try this place! Back in 2008-2009, I worked at Panorama Towers, and use to always say how a restaurant would be the perfect addition to the empty retail buildings outside. About time someone made it happen.  The Blind Pig has two areas. A cafe/pastry to go style side, and a restaurant/bar side. The booths are big and flashy looking, and it reminds me of a modern day, well lit, speakeasy, that isn't a secret.  I tried the chicken wings and meatballs as appetizers. A Bloody Mary cocktail for a drink. And for main entrees I tried the lobster/shrimp mac and cheese and the lobster roll.  The seafood dishes were both on point. Down the the roll used, the bread was fresh, not to soft, and perfectly toasted. I was also happy with both apps. Veal in a meatball is an instant winner in my opinion. And the blue cheese seemed as it was made in house. Nice and chunky! Service was decent. Not amazing, but not bad by any means. Prices are totally reasonable especially considering the location. I hope to return soon, and try some of the desserts.",

My most recommended dish is the Chicken Parmesan with Alfredo pasta, I love it! The pizzas here are also great!   If your looking for a place to grab a bite anytime I recommend giving this place a try! The kitchen is open until 2 am and this comes in very handy, especially for the nights I have class late.   If you're looking for a spot to hangout with friends and have a drink, this is the place to go! Very nice relaxing atmosphere with an amazing staff that makes your time here enjoyable and memorable!   For calm warm evenings there is outdoor seating which is perfect. Also, the proximity to the Strip make it ideal for anyone looking to check it out during their visit to Vegas! All in all give this a place a try and I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",

    "text": "The Blind Pig has to have one of the best services I have ever encountered for a restaurant. Our waiter was very nice, prompt, and informative with any questions we had about the menu. He repeated the specials of the day like a champ and told us which ones were the favorites among the menu items. The Blind Pig also sports a great free check in item in which you can get a free juice, smoothie, or coffee, not sure about cocktails, but the free smoothie is definitely worth it.   I went with a banana strawberry yogurt smoothie, the smoothie tasted creamy, fresh and delicious, it was a nice balance between the tart and sweetness of all 3 things. I shared the crinkle fries with cheese curds & gravy and some crispy pork belly nuggets. The fries with cheese curds & gravy were good, although they were not crinkle fries as was indicated on the menu, the waiter did inform us that they had changed it to regular fries months ago, but never changed it on the menu. The crispy pork belly nuggets were seasoned in some dark sauce that tasted sweet, the pork belly wasn't super crispy, there were bits that were and some that weren't.   For my entree, I wanted to eat something with a fork, so I skipped the sandwiches and ordered the lobster & shrimp mac n cheese. There was a decent amount of lobster and shrimp in here, cheese wasn't overwhelming. They use macaroni shells if you were wondering.",

    "text": "Meh... My boyfriend took me here for a random date night because he used to eat here when they still had Poutine and Lobster Mac on the menu (which apparently were very popular).   The decor of the restaurant has a big jazz feel to it. It'd be a great place to take a date; very dim lit, velvet booths with accent pillows, so it's very intimate for dinner time.   Pretty much every entree on the menu ranged from $15-$20, aside from their fish of the day options which were $25. By their prices I expected that their food was going to pretty good, or at least nothing to complain about, but boy was I wrong... I ordered the Lobster Raviolli ($18.99) and my boyfriend ordered the catch of the day-Salmon $24.99. There were exactly 5 pieces of raviolli on my plate, which were all swimming in sauce. The lobster taste was pretty much undectable, and for $18.99 for some damn raviolli, I'd like to taste some lobster. My boyfriend's salmon had a side, which I can't remember what it was so apparently it wasn't anything speciail lol, the salmon seemed to be only seasoned with salt and pepper and was extremely bland. My boyfriend's a big fan of salmon and he didn't even bother to finish his meal, it was that unimpressive.  The funny thing is, a LOT of people say the same thing about The Blind Pig; it's not the same since they've been under new management, the quality of the food isn't great, and the popular menu items are no longer there.   The reason why I gave this place 2 stars rather than 1 is because the service was great. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, even though she was obviously the only one working the floor.   If I were to come back, I'd come back just for the bar area. Their bartenders seemed entertaining and their signature cocktails looked good.",

The food was served pretty quickly. Our group of friends had a long night of partying so we were all a bit starving and ordered smoothies while waiting for our food. I can't remember the exact names of our wraps but everyone enjoyed their meals and we all had tons of potatoes left over. This pub is a little hidden gem for locals, especially the tenants in the apartments next door. I also found out they deliver  to the apartments which is another huge plus for those lazy nights you don't feel like cooking. This was my first experience here, I'd like to come back and try dinner and maybe happy hour. Until next time Blind Pig..",

I was in the mood for a chopped salad and read several reviews about how terrific it was.  I placed my order for the chopped salad and pretzel bites with beer cheese and brought it back to my office. The beer cheese and pretzel bites were still piping hot which was a plus! But the cheese was way too runny, like water. It tasted like onions soaked in water and was extremely disappointing.  The chopped salad was okay, but I felt like it was lacking something. I got the dressing on the side but I had the same soggy issue that others mentioned before even putting the dressing on there. I pushed the salad to the side and saw the bottom had a pool of water.  The staff was nice and I love that they have a patio so it may be worth coming back, but today was a disappointment.",

    "text": "First off, I have to say I was really, really worried about the parking situation and even came up with a Plan B in case parking didn't work out here.  Well, when we came in on a Sunday for lunch, there were plenty of open spots designated for The Blind Pig, and there was even an overflow area on the other side of the lot which still had some spaces available as well.    Also, another thing I must mention, make sure to check in on Yelp and show your free drink offer to your server!  You can select from their juices, smoothies, and signature cocktails if I recall correctly.    The restaurant was about half full when we arrived and we were given our choice of seating.  We selected a nice comfy booth.  I was worried that it would be tight after reading one of the reviews but it did not feel squished at all.  We were greeted promptly by our server and our food and drinks came out right away also.  We split their shrimp and lobster roll and shrimp and lobster mac and cheese.  Both dishes were good - we finished just about everything!  We maybe had some fries left over, which were maybe the best part of the meal - nice and crisp!    Service was just okay, but overall, a nice solid meal at The Blind Pig.  They posted a picture on Instagram of a po boy sandwich they were serving after we had dined there.  Would've tried that if it were available!  But still a great lunch, and the free drink was a nice plus to our meal :)",

    "text": "I like the lounge-feel interior of this place. Bricks, plush seats, curtains and interesting ceiling. They have a pantry where they have beer, wine and other libations as well as items you'd find in some pantries (fig almond cake, Nutella, pasta, real mustard, red pepper tapenade, etc.). They have Veuve and Moet! They have a deli section which has orzo pasta, couscous, salads, sandwiches, cheesecake, monkey bread, brownies, cookies (chocolate protein cookies even!), Nutella pound cake, and other desserts. Then, there's the bar and dining area. On the menu they have: appetizers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, pasta, steak frites, shrimp and lobster mac and cheese, salmon, ahi tuna, roasted chicken, smoothies and coffee.  Chocolate Hazelnut Verrine: This has got to be my Blind Pig favorite. Layers of delicious light chocolate mousse and sweet, nutty and crunchy brittle. 5/5  Orzo Pasta: It has a tiny bit of a tang and minty-ness - just enough to make it taste interesting. The texture is just right. It has olives, red onions and tiny bits of feta. 4/5  Nutella Pound Cake: I love pound cake and to add Nutella to to the batter is pure enjoyable madness! It's filling and delicious. Buttery cake with sweet chocolate hazelnut swirls. 5/5  Shrimp and Lobster Roll: I got this with a side of French fries. They use Oreida frozen fries - booooo! This had no flavor. The roll was toasted but it has no butter - maybe, they're health conscious? I really don't know but if I wanted something healthy, I'll eat a salad. 2/5  Porchetta: POR-KE-TA...not porch-eta...not porsche-eta. C'mon! I enjoy a good porchetta sandwich. That fat and oil with herbs, spices and salsa. My favorite version though has crispy skin and this one did not and tasted a bit much of fennel seeds. They are generous with pork portions though. 3.5/5  Skip the fries and the kombucha drink! Try the blackberry hibiscus drink though.",

In fact, it makes me hungry for it as I write this review, a couple days later. Other items we tried:  Meatballs: good, nothing special   Lobster and shrimp roll: not listed on the menu, but available; also good, not too mayonnaisy (which I liked) but could've used some old bay seasoning to give it a little extra flavor.  Steak frites: seasoned well and came with some yummy sauteed spinach  Our only complaint was the server. We were seated quickly and ordered drinks quickly (with someone else). But the server was nowhere in sight and finally appeared 10 minutes later. Mind you, it's a small restaurant with only about 10 other customers there that night. The server was very nice, but seemed confused when she came over (seemed like she thought we already ordered). At the end of the meal, she asked if we wanted dessert, but there's no dessert menu and she could only remember the tiramisu and one other item we couldn't make out. Don't ask us if we want dessert if you don't know what desserts are available, lol.  All in all, we'd go back for the poutine, but they probably won't be part of our regular rotation.",

The place was smaller than I expected... they had a long bar & about 3 booths w/ maybe 4 tables inbetween the bar & booths. There is also a deli side as well. The place had a very secretive vibe... it was kool though & interesting.   Someone came over & gave us some menus but they said they were  changing up the happy hour menu so they verbalized what items were on the list. We weren't too sure on who our server was... the bartender came over to get our drinks & order for us but some other guy did the rest of the work such as refills & plate clearing.   SHRIMP & LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE $18.50 - OMAN... this thing was rich & creamy goodness... but I would definitely not be able to finish it all as just an entree... it is a bit too heavy for my taste buds to finish all in one sitting. It was a great dish to share so that we all got a little taste.  BLIND PIG CHOPPED $9 - I thought this was a HUGE salad for $9 but it was good. Definitely have to say that it was a bit over dressed to the point the greens were pretty soggy.... will have to ask for dressing on the side next time, but it was REFRESHING overall to compliment w/ the Mac & cheese.  EVA'S GIN $10 - this was the most REFRESHING cocktail that I have tasted in a long time... & I was able to actually finish it & feel fine... so there may have been little alcohol but that's aOK for me. PLUS it was free w/ my check-in!!  Another great thing about this place is that they have HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY from 4-7 pm!!",

But they definitely get points for trying to be creative. The Tom Collins with the basil simple syrup was the best.  We went for the prime rib special they offer on Saturdays. We didn't have a reservation and since it was fight night we had to sit outside since nearly every table inside was reserved. The waitress didn't really seem to know the menu very well. The special said it came with a salad, potato, and sauteed spinach.   The prime rib was flavorful, but almost too flavorful - I was instantly skeptical. I think they sauteed it in a pan with some seasonings because it was still cold.   All in all we thought the experience was fine...until I woke up the next morning. Severe gastrointestinal distress - I'll just leave it at that.   Won't be going back, that's for sure.",

Its nice to see this is Las Vegas.    My only issue is the cost.  The price point is a touch too high for their food.  I understand that it is necessary to have higher fees because of their location and hours but Its about $1 too high on almost all products.  I had a turkey sandwich that was amazing but priced at over $12... its not worth it.  I don't mind spending on good food and everything seemed fresh.  Plus, I would love to make it a regular place that I frequent but I don't know if this price is worth it.  However, I will definitely be back (maybe not as often as I was hoping) and I would still highly recommend it.  Note:  I didn't try the pizza... hopefully that will change my mind.  My other small issue (and this may be because it just opened or because I completely missed it) is that the products on the shelves didn't have the price.  Awesome that they even sell some of these items, but it seems odd that its not tagged or easy to find.  I'm sure this will be fixed soon.  Servers and staff were great!",

    "text": "Met some friends for breakfast on Sunday morning on 09/17/17 around 9am. Our waitress was a middle aged dark haired woman with a bad attitude and was rude to us. The restaurant was not busy and she only had 3 tables and had a helper so not sure if our waitress was new and in training . Her helper was the one that was nice to us though.  My friend has a severe seafood allergy and was asking the waitress if there was any cross contamination with the grill, spatulas etc. The rude waitress commented in her smart aleck attitude \" our breakfast is not cooked in seafood!\" and just laughed about it. Well severe food allergies that send you to the hospital are a serious matter! That's nothing to laugh about!  My friend ordered a mimosa and the rude waitress said \" I can't make that because our bartender is not here\" then she decided to bring it after all. Seriously it's not rocket science to pour some champagne in some OJ. I had asked for my Oj again that she forgot to bring and she rudely said \"When I catch up with everything then I'll bring it!\" I ordered eggs with hash browns because that's what it says in the menu. She rudely said \"We don't have hash browns, we have potatoes!\" ... well then it should not say hash browns in the menu! She could have said nicely \" I'm sorry we don't have hash browns today but would you like potatoes instead?\" Seriously this waitress needs to go back in training and learn how to give good customer service and leave the sour attitude at home! Not impressed with the food. The potatoes tasted old and microwaved and so did the burnt bacon. She never even brought us butter and jam for our dry toast. She did not even ask how everything was. The only reason why I left a tip was because I felt bad for the nice young lady that was helping her. Not impressed at all! We won't be back.",

The house chopped salad was top of the line, and the lasagna was delicious....just a bit to cheesy....id recommend a lil less cheese and a lil more marinara. I would also recommend bigger wine glasses so that the wine can breath, because the other ones are to small and the waitresses fill them to the top and even hit the bottle on the glass  (constructive criticism). Other then that....I really enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and I'll be back again. Thank you guys.",

It's not over the top or anything, but they offer really good food for a good price, and it's fast and quick enough to get in and out and on my way.  The staff is wonderful and are always willing to substitute or make changes to dishes without a problem!   Parking is VERY limited and the dining room is on the smaller side, so be sure to get their before dining rush hours.  I would recommend it for friends, but not to plan a dinner date or anything beyond a good lunch.",

However, it's a nice and quiet place to eat at if you want to avoid big restaurant crowds.   Their menu consists of appetizers, some entries, and mainly sandwiches. The food is reasonably priced, too - most of the items are below $20. I had the onion rings and the shrimp & lobster mac n' cheese. The onion rings were really good - fresh out of the kitchen! The mac n' cheese looked more like typical pasta, but it's still pretty good nonetheless.  Overall, I would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "The Blind Pig is close to my work that isn't too pricey like the strip or fast food crap that surrounds the area. I'm in love with the speakeasy steak sandwich! I've also had the BP Burger which was great but a burger is a burger to me. I have yet to order anything else but when I see other people's food come out it all looks great. But like I said I'm hooked on the steak sandwich. Every time I've ordered it I get medium rare and it's cooked perfectly never underdone or over. The steak is seasoned well, my fries are crispy. I enjoy their Bloody Mary too, nothing fancy there it's just made well and not with that mixed bottle tomato juice either.  Now I must explain the 4 stars last time I went my waitress seemed preoccupied or something. She wasn't listening very well we had to repeat our order a few times to her. She didn't check on us very much so you had to grab her when you could. She would walk away and take forever to come back. Not good for people like me eating on my lunch break and only have so much time.",

    "text": "Alright, so whenever I eat at various restaurants I don't take much into consideration from friends...since everything is based on perspective. With that being said I was recommended to check out the Bling Pig by several friends, so we did.  Upon arriving we find, no parking. Where do you park? Under the overpass, in front...is there any other parking? A few cars were parked in red...we went into Bravo Tickets (business next door) and asked if we could park in one of their spaces, they were nice enough to allow this...but what if they hadn't...where were we to park?  Open seating in a small-ish location, but were comfortable with our choice. Server or manager (blonde lady in white button up) asked if we wanted to combine tables, since there was 5 of us...we declined but thanked her for the offer. We placed our drink order then shortly after we placed our appetizer order:  Pork belly nuggets - amazing Poutine - you can't go wrong with gravy cheese and crinkle cut fries Quesadilla - meh, wasn't impressed...I think I just didn't like the cheese Chicken wings - usual hot sauced wings  We then order our entrees:   Shrimp and lobster macaroni and cheese - incredible Steak frites - great prep, and tasted great  So far so good...right? No, I haven't mentioned the waitress...server...busser...manager...?  Ok, so we have 3 people assisting us...cocktail waitress, whom never asked if we wanted another round. The server...she was hit or mainly miss...we asked 3 times for refills on sodas...my girlfriend ended up going to the bar herself for the refills. Our busser, Michael, was on point. I think maybe he needs a promotion as he helped us more than either of the other 2. Come time for our bill...the server as well as the cocktail waitress are talking in the back by the bar. I raised my had and waved like I was in grade school...nope that didn't get their attention. Luckily Michael had walked by and I asked him for the check, which he was able to break the 2 up from their conversation and the cocktail waitress brought over our check....she collected shortly after. We wait...we wait...we wait....server drops what looked like a check to another table then walked outside...the cocktail waitress was who knows where...10 minutes later i go to the bar and ask the bartender for our checks...he looked confused but wanted to help, looks back then says oh it's right here....seriously? Not his fault by any means, but why didn't the server or the cocktail waitress bring this out?  I would love to go back, but it'll be a last choice if I do. Although one of my friends, whom dined with us, mentioned the bar staff was on point and their service was much better and they were very attentive. So maybe we'll go back and sit at the bar or just ask for Michael to assist us.",

We got the Pastrami Reuben and the Shrimp and Lobster Roll sandwich. Superb! The atmosphere is great--cosmopolitan and swanky. The servers here are quick and the service is great.

If you order of the menu, the food is decent, average at best. Burgers are good, lobster roll is a joke, salads use cheap lunch meat. I will say the cheesecake is amazing and it should be for the $7 price tag for a small piece. Most likely won't be going back unless I'm desperate. I'll stick to Nordstrom cafe!",

I ended up getting the French dip style roast beef sandwich. It was very good, I loved fried onions on it they made a welcome addition to the sandwich. It could have used a tad bit more of horseradish on it but overall it was good. My friend had ordered the burger and I was able to snag a bite... It was to die for. So good. The bacon added just the right amount of smoke to the burger without over powering the burger itself. We also ordered a couple of the signature drinks which were good as well.   The only drawback I can say was the price it's a little on the pricey side for a burger or sandwich which side choices are coleslaw or potato salad. But regardless of the price I will definitely be back! I'm already craving a burger.   It's easy to get to and the parking is convenient.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner and it was OK. Not amazing, but not bad either. Food was solid. We had the poutine, grilled cheese, and the pulled pork sandwich. My pulled pork sandwich was luke warm but had a good flavor. Cocktails were a little too sweet. Atmosphere is ok, music was almost too quiet, the restaurant was basically empty at 6:30pm (a red flag?) and it felt a little uncomfortable to talk for fear of disturbing the one other table of people there. Probably won't go back just because Vegas has so many other tastier options to choose from.",
