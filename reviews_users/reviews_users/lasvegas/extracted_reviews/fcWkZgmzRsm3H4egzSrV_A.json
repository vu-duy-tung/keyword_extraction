    "text": "Great dim sum spot in Vegas with very authentic food and good service. The ladies with the carts full of food will automatically come to your table and ask what you would like. I'd recommend most dishes except for the har gao and siu mai; those two are still made better at Gold Coast. But otherwise, dig in!   Also, if you're a fan of egg tarts, this place makes it with the flakiest crust I've ever had and they quickly sold out. The last few times I went I had to ask the waiter to bring it to me once they are ready from the kitchen. I actually saw a table arguing with their waiter when they waited for the egg tarts to come out and, when they did, they were all reserved for everyone who had the sense to pre-order. Ha!",

We waited for an hour to be seated, yet there were two jerks walked pass us, cut the line, and took our table in front of us while the host already prepared the table  and called our number just because they are seven stars. I understand that seven stars have better benefits than regular customers, but they should at least have a separate system for other card members. If anyone who has seven stars card can walk, doesnt that mean we have to wAit here forever to be seated?????? However there was one server who was brave enough to say something to these two guys but she couldn't do anything else because the jerks kept saying something in Chinese and made it a scene. All we heard was \"seven stars, seven stars.\" Besides that the host just let them seat there at the table without even apologize or do anything.",

It's brand new, thus very clean, the decor is gorgeous, the ambiance has a romantic, gourmet feel. 20% I you're a local. I'm in heaven here",

I asked what the 'House Combination Special' and was told it was a mixture of things from their appetizer menu. After I ordered a gentleman came to me and told me that it wasn't what I wanted. This resulted in a long conversation where i had to justify my choice- which was beyond frustrating. I got order, which consisted of 3 things, all cold. I specifically said I didn't want the cold platter when offered it. It wasn't what I was told I was ordering OR what I expected. The food I ate was fine, however having a resturant decide what I want for food is not acceptable. I would never recommend it for that reason.",

When we arrived, the hostess was on her cell, after she ended her call, she proceeded to pick up and read a newspaper. We had to call to her attention that we'd like to be seated (she did notice us when she was chatting away), she then mumbled something to a server who clearly didn't hear her. We went ahead and seated ourselves since we weren't getting anyone's attention.   We noticed a few other groups arrived and were getting much superior service, they appear to be frequent visitors or friends of the waitress, as they greeted each other. Guess you need to be in the inner circle to get any decent service.  We then ordered tea and requested chili sauce, the waiter had forgotten our request and we had to request them a second time. Right off the bat we were put off by the poor service. Likely won't return again. These restaurants need to learn the lesson that poor customer service can be costly, as I've seen time and time again. Such a shame.",

I would  suggest looking at a menu before hand so you know what dim sum to look for so you can fill up on what you really want. My favorite was the pork steam buns and the taro muffins.  I really had no idea what to expect when the bill came because we ate so much food but to my surprise the bill was only $50! Another important tip is you can get a to-go box, so when in doubt always grab more! I will definitely be back next time I am in town.",

Thanks to all the wonderful yelpers out there, I wasn't disappointed.   Good quality and freshness made the dim sum items taste pretty good. There was always a good amount of food circulating on the carts. I really recommend ordering the rice rolls here! They are probably the BEST rice rolls I've had in a LONG time!! My only complaint is that there wasn't enough variety of dim sum items and the portions were kinda smaller than what I'm used to getting in LA.   I didn't try dim sum anywhere else in Vegas, but I'm going to trust the other yelpers and agree that for the quality of the dim sum items here, the price wasn't too bad. The bill came out to be around $50 for 4 people, which is more than what we are used to paying in LA but it is Vegas so I guess it's expected that it's a bit more.   Overall: I would totally recommend dim sum here!",

Instead, we chose the Rio, a good second choice, off the strip, and not a total party spot. After poker, my hubby came home as most restaurants were closing. After a bad experience at the All American (see my review on them), we decided to try KJ's. Hubby had never tried dim sum and I am always in the mood for some. Lets just say impressive! The food was on point. I have never been impressed by dim sum before, since its usually hit or miss (too soggy, not cooked enough ect), but this place was on point. I do wish they had a bigger night time menu, but the helpful employee explained that it was the off season, so they only had the traveling dim sum tray during the day. I ordered what was available and waited. The only reason this is not 5 stars is because of the staff. I understand it may be a cultural thing, but I don't need to be watched while eating. And setting the cloth napkin in my lap for me made me feel like I was 5 years old again. Other than that, amazing food.",

The service was pretty good, the carts came around multiple times and there were plenty of waiters walking around with separate plates of food.  I may be too biased, having had dim sum in California, but it wasn't any better than the other places in town. The only difference is that this one just happens to be nicer looking and more pricey, which does not make up for the very ordinary food.  I might come back and try some of the other plates. Like the fried noodles or maybe the congee, but I feel like I going to one of the two near my house would be a better choice instead.",

We ended up parking on the opposite end. It's busy here but we only waited 10 minutes to get a table (on a  weekend). This has got to be nicest, fanciest and cleanest dim sum restaurant I've been to.  There were carts that would pass by every 5 minutes. I didn't see my favorite dim sum items though like the roast pork and deep-fried minced pork/beef dumplings. We were there for at least an hour so, I doubt we missed it.  We got har gow, siumai, chicken feet (I don't eat feet of any animal), roast duck, shrimp wontons, baked cha siu bao, steamed cha siu bao (BBQ pork buns), crispy shrimp roll, salt and pepper shrimps, egg custard, shrimp balls, calamari and sweet tofu. My favorites were: roast duck, shrimp balls and sweet tofu - they have the best version of these dishes in town. I've had sweet tofu that has a strong ginger flavor...KJ's version is just right.

    "text": "I am a dim sum connoisseur, I've been eating it since I was 10.  When I visit  a city I want them to show me what they've got. I visited KJ Dim Sum & Seafood the day after I visited  Ping Pang Pong. I arrived at both restaurants late for typical dim sum. I also showed up at both locations with 2 different sets of people who'd never had dim sum before. The difference in the experiences was night and day and difficult not to compare. It didn't help that both restaurants are across the street from one another Ping Pong Pang is in the Gold Coast which reeks of old smoke, cheap liquor and the sweat of desperation. The other is in the Rio which may be as old as the Gold Coast but it's kept itself in better shape so you aren't turned off by your experience and your nostrils aren't assaulted with funk before you even get to the restaurant. KJ  Dim Sum is also close to the exit of the casino.  We were seated fast and maybe because we were late and they were empty the trays came often and fast. What didn't they have? By the time my cousins came back from the restroom our table was pretty much covered with dim sum and my mouth was full. By the way you should know that the restrooms are a bit of a trek from the dining room so govern yourselves accordingly.   The food was good so I'll be honest I didn't really want to stop and explain what everything they hadn't seen before was. Can I just tell you I'm tempted to give this place a 5 because they had duck. So few dim sum eateries have duck and their duck was delicious. The only drawback was that the duck was a little on the cold side and filled me up so much that I couldn't really do much but peck at the other dim sum dishes we ordered. What I had, I enjoyed and was prepared in a style I've become accustomed to over the years. My newbie cousins actually asked where dim sum had been all their lives. To which I explained that much of America has been deprived of quality authentic Chinese food which is a crying shame.  While I found the prices at Ping Pang Pong to be a little bit higher than I'm accustomed to. I walked away from KJ Dim Sum feeling like I got a deal. I might just stay out at the Rio on my next visit to Vegas so I can eat there every day of my stay. I don't like having to travel miles for good Chinese food. Call me spoiled. If you have only have a chance to choose one of the two go with KJ Dim Sum. Looking forward to my next visit to Vegas to sample the other Dim Sum Spots.",

    "text": "We usually go here for dim sum and the food and service is good.  The dim is a little pricey but that's expected being that it's inside a casino.  So tonight we decided to stop by for dinner.  We weren't too hungry so we just ordered crab meat with fish maw soup and their \"Imperial Peking Duck\".  Soup: it was ok. Nothing special compared to other soups at restaurants in LA. $20 a bowl.  Duck: This was a total rip-off and I'll tell you why. The dish alone is $42 bucks !  That's about $10-$15 dollars over other restaurants in the area.  But we accepted the price since we knew Peking duck comes 2 ways and that would sort of make up for the price.  The usual crispy skin with bao buns and then minced duck with lettuce wraps is usually how the dish is served.  So they bring out the duck and it is the \"complete\" duck, meat and skin and all.  So we asked about the minced meat part with lettuce wraps.  They informed us that it would be extra charge.  $15 dollars extra to be exact.  The waiter kept telling us that they don't do it like LA restaurants. I don't know what he's talking about since restaurants in the area do duck 2 ways when you order Peking duck. I don't care where your at. When you order Peking duck, it is always served 2 ways and not charged EXTRA. The price on the menu is the price you pay!  Anyway.  We settled with what we had and asked about ordering more bao for our duck. We only wanted a couple more. The waiter first told us that you have to order by 3 or 6.  Then he comes back after checking with manager that minimum order is 6. The baos' are $.75 per !    At this point we were totally dumbfounded and furiously frustrated by how badly we just got ripped off and how this restaurant tries to nickel and dime you with their outrageous extra charges.    The waiter, sensing our great disappointment, offers us free dessert. It was taro with tapioca and was good, but not enough to dissuade me from writing this poor but deserving review.  The food was good and they did try to give us some sort of comfort with the free dessert.  For that, I give them 2 stars.",

Everything I ate came right back out... I slept next to the toliet... the night before new years eve lol  The food was alright... I guess I'm a little snobby when it comes to Chinese food and this place was probably one of the weaker Chinese food place I've eaten at. Although their chrysanthemum tea was really good, their food was alright. Also, they charge for hot tea so make sure you don't mindlessly agree to hot tea when they ask you. In socal, the tea was always free.:(  The best dish we had was the beef chunks that was still sizzling as it was placed on our table. Everything else wasn't worth mentioning. The food portion was a.bit smaller for the price we paid for it... but then again we're in vegas.   Anyways, be safe my friends. Be cautious of what you eat.",

    "text": "Located inside the Rio close to the Carnival Buffet end, KJ is pretty much on par with Ping Pang Pong, another dim sum place at the Gold Coast.  These places reside in the older hotel casino places that are designed to attract more value-minded Chinese people who are looking for cheaper limit gambling and are comfortable having something familiar and convenient without having to leave the premises.  We were attracted to KJ because someone told my wife that they had the best dim sum in Vegas, but that just makes me feel more leery of the local standards for such food...  The dining room is large and expansive, especially when compared to PPP.  The feel is like that of an 80's style HK or Cantonese dim sum house complete with old school push carts making their rounds.  On the day we went, the dining room wasn't half filled at 1130am, but ebbed and flowed while we were there and seemed busier by the time we were finished.  The crowd was not very diverse, about 95% Chinese which was probably a good sign actually...  The three of us each picked the items that we liked although I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous this day as I only went for the items that I personally wanted.  Usual staples such as haw gow and siu mai I didn't even bother trying myself this time.  Some of the items were disappointing because they were not piping hot like the Vegetarian Pan Fried Rice Noodles (haw fun) and the Fried Turnip Cake (low bok go) was downright cold, to the point that we had to ask them to return it to the kitchen where they reheated it as opposed to replacing it with a fresh one.  The service didn't balk when we asked them to do this and was polite and attentive all around and the push-cart ladies were mostly cheerful...  I had the Sticky Rice (new my fon) wrapped in leaves and the Thousand Year Egg Porridge (pay don sow yuk juk) and was generally satisfied  although both of them were not particularly special and maybe even a little flat or bland tasting...  I found the Green Tea Buns surprisingly good.  Their outside texture was not unlike a pineapple bun with a crumbly, crusty top but the flavor of the filling was not quite as sweet as a pineapple bun.  Two out of three of these on the plate had a lighter color than the third one which I can only assume meant that they came from different batches...  Since it wasn't too crowded during our visit it was nice that we didn't have to fight over the items in the carts with other patrons, but the bad side is that you worry about food turnover and items becoming stale and in some cases cold.  I was generally satisfied with our experience although nothing particularly felt special or stood out to me, but my expectations could be affected by my experience with places like Ping Pang Pong where I had very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised, and then coming here after being recommended to us.  I would return but probably not come out of my way, aside from being in LV in the first place...",

They got shut down by the Health Department, for a week in January, so I decided to give KJ a try.  The Yelp secret for KJ is to do the Dim Sum for breakfast or lunch, and to arrive around 10 am, when they open . I have eaten dinner at this location, and agree with my friend Stefany V, that there is better Chinese food for dinner.   I have found the actual taste of the Dim Sum to be tastier, and fresher than Orchid Garden. I do not think they have as much variety as Orchid Garden, but I feel they serve better quality and better tasting Dim Sum.   Costwise; they are about the same as Orchid Garden.   Again, for good Dim Sum, fresh, hot, and good service, get there at 10 am, when they open.",

    "text": "While many of my Chinese food experiences in Las Vegas have been mediocre, I was pleasantly surprised by KJ. Their dim sum rivaled some of the places in LA and definitely beats any of the places in Las Vegas Chinatown. I haven't tried the KJ in Chinatown for dim sum but their dinner is pretty decent.    The place is clean and the waiters are respectful. I like that even though they are in a casino, they kept the traditional food carts on the floor. That's what makes dim sum, dim sum. Food comes around pretty often and they have a good selection.   You know this place is good when Chinese people are eating here and they went out of their way to come to a casino to eat.",

We are all from or eat regularly at Chinese restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley so we know what authentic Chinese food taste like.   The place looks pretty nice and the service was pretty good. Wasn't hard to get the attention of the wait staff. The dim sum was pretty decent. The only problem we had with it was that it wasn't piping hot like we would find at NBC in Monterey Park. We also had dinner here as it was about 50 degrees outside with a bracing wind and didn't want to take the in-laws outside. We were pretty satisfied with the dinner too. The pork chop with spicy salt was good as I had at any Sam Woo and the sauteed pea shoots were very tender and delicious.   The prices were of course higher than anything in the San Gabriel valley but, they weren't as bad as I thought they would be. However, it you want a bargain, just drive a couple blocks north to Spring Mountain Rd. and try one of the many asian restaurants there.",

Sorry but ill go to Orchids Garden before i eat dim sum here again.",

They also actually have carts which is nice, definitely a rare sight these days.  Xiao long bao: Medium skin, a little bit of soup and you get three in little individual tins. The tins are fun because they keep the soup in   Ha/Sha chang fun: Woaaahh tons of the rice noodle wrapping and little shrimp but otherwise pretty good  Shumai: *two thumbs up*  Dan tat: We got it fresh...but definitely less egg yolk than other places. I like my dan tat really yellow otherwise they taste more like cream than anything  They also have kai lan, shi fan etc etc. Fairly authentic but I do feel as if there are some short cuts made ingredients wise. Definitely wouldnt complain to come back again but wouldn't put it on my must-visit list either  Staff is nice and no complains there either :)",

The stamp is good for any Harrahs location that offers the discount, besides this place. They could easily verify by calling rewards but instead were very rude and didn't even try to listen to me.   They have lost my business. I've talked dozens of people into going across the street to ping pang pong instead. If located inside the casino you should respect the casinos rules and customers.",

Located inside the Rio across from the Carnival Buffet, this place is good for late night Chinese food eats as they are open till 2:00am!   No HIS/HER orders here. More of a \"community\" type meal where you share orders.   1.) We always start with the CRAB MEAT & FISH MAW soup. This can serve about 7 people (small bowl) but honestly I can never have just one! Not too salty with a porridge type texture. A must try! (8/10)  2.) A hidden gem that's not on the menu, you have to ask for the FRENCH BEEF. It is not a large dish, but the meat is seriously cooked and seasoned to utter perfection! Another must try. (10/10)  3.) We also get the crispy PAN FRIED NOODLES, which is honestly more of his favorite, are crispy noodles that soften with the sauce it is topped with -- comes with vegetables, shrimp, scallops and fish. This is his go-to... He swears by it! (9/10)  4.) To add some veggies into the mix, you can't go wrong with CHINESE BROCOLLI WITH OYSTER SAUCE. A generous amount of the steamed, leafy stalks with a side of the brown sauce (a little goes a long way!) (9/10)  5.) I personally am not a big fan of the SALT & PEPPER PORK CHOPS, but it's something he always orders too. A tad oily for my taste and honestly too salty. I'm not a big fan of pork or super oily and salty foods, so this is just not for me. (3/10)  6.) Probably one of my newest favorites is the BEEF CHOW FUN. Wide rice noodles with tender stir-fried beef with bean sprouts & onions... So savory. I can eat just one order and nothing else, it's that good! (10/10)  7.) I'm a big fan of fried rice, and I must say this place has amazing DRY SCALLOP FRIED RICE. It's not too oily and is not too salty... A good portion and pairs well with anything you order! (9/10)",

The servers must get their cardio in when it's super busy.   We ordered all of our standard dim sum items and to be quite honest nothing stood out. Nothing was amazing compared to any other local dim sum place and they also didn't have a couple things that we typically get elsewhere. However, they did have some interesting blue colored seafood dumplings and black squid ink dumplings. The service was fast but prices seemed to be a little bit higher since its in a casino? ...we probably won't be back unless we happen to be in the neighborhood.   HOT TIP: Park in the parking lot or the parking garage closest to the corner of Valley View and Flamingo so that you can directly walk to the restaurant instead of walking through the casino~",

Service was quick, and they went out of their way to go get dishes that they had stopped serving. Awesome! After ordering a ton of items in a group of 5, it came out to $25/pp and we were stuffed with a decent amount of leftovers for a whole meal.   If I'm craving dim sum in the future, it'd be a close call between here and Dim Sum Cafe.",

The pros of this place was that the price of some of the dishes were cheaper ($3 for some certain dishes.. now if only the conversion rate was in my favour), and the crazily efficient service of all the cart ladies. We were a party of 6 and were seated right away (less than half of the restaurant was filled up), as we had arrived around 11am, which is a bit earlier than the rush. Once we sat down, the cart ladies were quick to come over one right after another to show us their available selections. I have never been to a dim sum restaurant where we got all the dishes we want within minutes. I'm so used to always eyeing carts for everyone's favourite dishes, and even asking the servers for specific dishes. We barely had time to start eating the dishes that were already in front of us, when the cart ladies made their way back to us again. We joked that they might have been on commission, as they were very persistent. We were in and out in less than an hour, which was faster than the shake shack line we were in the night prior.  I would recommend if you're looking for a quick meal, but don't expect a mind blowing meal.",

Ease of getting there already earns 2 stars! And BC free parking -who doesn't like free parking on the strip? Food also tasted hot. It is very important to me that the food is piping steaming hot bc that is the only way to truly taste the wonderful flavors and fully savor each and every bite! Now the reason I'm saying this is bc our friends kept telling us to visit Ping Pang Pong (what an interesting name by the way...), but why did nobody tell me that our food was going to come out cold? Every. single. dish. The hottest thing might have been the outside of a bun but the inside was cold (Egg Yolk bun) yo, last time I checked, the filling is supposed to be pretty warm/hot! Ok why is this turning into a rant about PPP. Sorry back to you- as I was saying. The service and quick and the food is great. The end.",

We were seated quickly and although it took a little longer than we would have liked to get drinks and dim sum service started, once the carts started coming around the food was plentiful and good.  We ordered a number of items and although not the best dim sum I've ever had, it was good and everyone in my party left satisfied.   The decor and restaurant setup is lovely and there is plenty of space to accommodate many large parties, which is the best way to enjoy dim sum. The more is definitely the merrier here.",

    "text": "I might not be Chinese but have eaten dim sum all over town for over 30 years!  I am not a tourist or first time eating dim sum. But  it seemed like the dim sum cart would go around to every table a 2 or 3 times before even attempting to come by our table. But since they seated us right next the kitchen door, you would think they would see some 6'5\" guy frantically waving his arms for the cart to stop and come by to no avail. When the always half full cart finally came by I asked for fried calamari.  Much to my surprise they did have that batter fried beauty which is one of  my dim sum favorites.  Not my surprise it was cold and and dry.  As they were quickly walking away I requested another calamari. After 3 people coming to my table asking why I am sending the cold dry calamari back they finally agreed.  Promptly 2 minutes later piping hot calamari was delivered. WOW I thought now what good service. Until I looked down and it was the same plate, with the same little soy sauce and the same calamari. Now not only was it the same plate of old cold and dry calamari just microwaved. After trying to chew these usually tender morsels, I might need to go dentist to sharpen what's left of my teeth after trying to chew these from now unrecognizable pieces of battered rubber. Asking why they would just try to reheat my old calamari . Which is now better suited for retreading my tires. She responded this is all there is. I said really it's 11:45 on a Sunday morning and your out already.  After seeing many more carts coming out with what looked like fresh calamari on it. I guess they just thought no more just for me! I again asked if the carts could come by. Much to my amazement they said I could just asked what I wanted they would just bring it to me.  Asking for some more of the basics, shrimp balls stuffed wonton with fish cake etc. all hand delivered all old and cold!!! None was taken from the outgoing carts but out from the adjacent kitchen doors.  Wondering why if it's coming right out of the kitchen how it would be so dry and cold. Our friends of 40 years, whom have owned several restaurants who were dining with us said, it was it might be the SMARTER for me not to order anymore! I may say this might have been the worst dim sum out of hundreds of times I've ever eaten dim sum over 30 years. The only thing worse than the food was what I felt as a non-Asian just trying to eat. FIRST and LAST time there! If this is the standard customer service or quality of food I say PASS! Any worse service they could close for the day for sensitivity training!!!",

    "text": "KJ Dim Sum is usually our go to spot when we have friends or family in town or when we just crave dim sum. It was a dim sum craving kind of day and my kids love the shrimp dumplings.  We came in late at 2:30pm before dim sum ends at 3pm. I usually like coming in as soon as they open so we get fresh made dim sum and not the end of the day dim sum. But as I mentioned before, today was a last minute dim sum craving day. The place was not busy and we sat down right away. We ordered shrimp dumplings, pork shu mai, shrimp rolls and beef chow fun. Everything was good. Then we got the beef chow fun, there was lots of onions, green onions and bean sprouts but minimal noodles and beef. All I tasted were the veggies. No, seriously!!! I have gotten in the past and it's perfect. Not sure if they started getting stingy with the noodles and beef part. Since I was paying $15 for the beef chow fun, I said something to the server and he basically said, \"This is how we make it. If you want another one, you can order another one.\" Wow. Not friendly and not helpful. I asked for a manager. The manager was more accommodating and had them make another dish for me to go. That was nice. When I got home, I looked in the to go dish and problem not really solved. Still so much veggies and bit more beef and noodles. All I have to say is I won't be ordering this dish here any longer. Not worth it.   Other than that experience, we love KJ Dim Sum and will continue to come here for dim sum only.",

Enjoyed the egg tarts (flaky crust, good flavor), fresh crunchy Chinese broccoli w oyster sauce, shrimp rice noodles, dumpling w shrimp and veggies, sweet pork bun (tasted wine) Just OK- shu mai.",

The staff there are friendly and constantly checks on us through out the meal. Making sure our tea was filled with hot water, or even the soda and water are topped off. Also offered extra sauce to our dishes we ordered if we like. We started with the egg flower soup. Served nice and hot. Then the main dishes came out after we finished the soup. Braised yee noodles, Peking style pork chops, and sweet and sour fish fillets. All the dishes were served hot from the kitchen. Nice flavors and really tasty. If you want rice, need to order. As we finished up and getting ready to leave, the staff still comes by to check on us, even as the restaurant was filling up and getting busy. Definitely will be coming back.",

I can't say it is a 4 but a 3 1/2, yes. The restaurant wasn't busy or crowed and thought we would be in and out, in no time. Our server was very friendly and helpful in navigating us through the menu. The food was prepared quickly as we had hoped. Chicken and Broccoli is my go to, when I am not sure about the menu. It was good, not great, it lacked flavor and taste. The meal was served hot. The price of our dinners were very reasonable.

Piping hot and fresh, good flavors, they had my favorites but u do have to order the steamed egg yolk buns which are yellow colored on the outside too unlike the Lai Wong baos. Really good lo Mai gais sticky rice in lotus leaf too bc they actually have the salted duck egg unlike a lot of other cheaper dim sum places. All the customers were Chinese mostly speaking Cantonese too so we know where it's at. My favorite steamed bean curd roll was so hot it nearly burned my tongue as u bite into it with good light perfect sauce. Mmmmmm. They didn't have the taro Mochi or the goji berry jello though nor the matcha baked buns so darn. Taro buns were just ok for me, I guess I prefer them in Mochi or savory dishes. With a lot of really solid dishes here, I may have to come back to eat the e-fu noodles or even something different like shanghai chow mein. I was too full to order the Jia Leung Chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle with hoisin and regular sauce since I had to order another of the egg yolk buns bc they were so good and I ate 4 out of 6 between my husband and I...pig.... Very happy with the food and will come back again hopefully with more people so I can order and try more dishes!!",

Steamed Pork Spareribs in Black Bean Sauce - Okay, but again nothign special, very fatty.  Chicken Feet - Mediocre, lacking in flavor, possibly underseasoned.  Rice Wrapped in Bamboo Leaves (Zong Zi) - Very mediocre, somewhat bland and mushy.  Fried Shrimp Ball - Mediocre, lacking in flavor, very dense, and not crispy.

I thought the food was good,  nothing amazing like i cant get anywhere else. But i was pretty disappointed in the amount of dishes they provided.  I get it,  its a tuesday. Maybe they have better food on the weekends,  u tell me. And they had maybe 5 carts of different things going around,  3 being tofu & congee & chinese broccoli. We got 6 dishes off of the first cart. Thinking theres gonna be more,  there wasnt. What we got was pretty much their staple. And the restaurants was 1/2-3/4 full,  but only have one cart of each going around is a bit slow to me.. But whatever idc. Just disappointed in the fact that there wasnt as much options. I can get alot more dishes at other dimsum spot ive tried in the midwest. And i had to ask for certain dishes because it wasn't on the cart (even tho i saw them bring it to other requesters).  My favorite thing there is probably the egg tarts. So much flavor abd u can taste the custard in it,  alot of places dont hit that right spot for it.  Their dessert is probably what i would come back for if im really craving it.  Service is bad,  which i knew coming in, no expectations there. Food is good but not that many options,  maybe go on the weekends for more options. But was disappointed.",

I was also surprised to see that our party of 6 could be seated right away considering we were there on a holiday weekend during peak dinner hours.  However, what really bothered me was how scatter brained the wait staff was. The table next to us was waiting most of their meal for their order of fried rice to come out. So much so that when we got our order, they thought that it was their order (so did we...and even the waiter wasn't sure so he had to go back and check). We also asked for our sweet & sour soup to come out first (as it should) and yet it came out 2nd and only after we asked our waitress where it was.   This just seemed to be the place's MO. On several occasions we saw servers come up to our & others' tables with food in their hand not sure if they were to put them down or bring them to a different table.   If the are able to straighten this out, this restaurant would be a great place to check out while at the Rio. However, until then, if I want some good Chinese food, I'll just drive down the street a bit & visit Vegas' Chinatown.",

    "text": "Before heading off our separate ways home, my friends and I decided to have some breakfast. After eating at too many buffets over the weekend, we went with a controlled portion breakfast.  My friend suggested that we eat at his favorite dim sum spot. Apparently, when we got here, he wasn't the only one who thought  this was his favorite dim sum spot in Vegas. Our party consisted of 11 (10 adults and 1 toddler). We were early enough to get seated right away. This place reminded of some dim sum spots back in the Bay Area, but on a smaller scale. Waiters still pushed carts from table to table up selling items we wanted or to pass up. Our table came to order the following dishes:  - Pork siu mai  - Calamari - Chinese broccoli - Pan fried noodles with chicken - BBQ pork bun - Rice noodle wrapped with beef - Roast duck   All these items were very tasty. The rice noodle wrapped with beef, calamari, and the pan fried noodles with chicken were my personal favorites. The rice noodle dish was something new to me, but reminded me of my love for beef chow fun. The pan fried noodles were semi-crispy but soft and paired well with the tender chicken.  Service was not the greatest. It gets busy to a point where your table maybe forgotten. One of the waitresses spilled water on my friend and apologized.   Overall experience: 3.5 stars",

When I came to visit again and only had time for lunch, I was surprised when she asked me to meet her at the KJ located in the Rio for dim sum.  Surprisingly, the Dim Sum here was not bad. A bit pricey, but decent.  They have all the regular selections: hai gow, shu mai, lotus wraps, shrimp noodle, chicken feet, spareribs etc.  The portion sizes were comparable to most dim sum places and the ladies pushing the carts came by frequently.  It's definitely not up to par to the dim sum in LA/SGV or SF...but for vegas, I have nothing to complain about.  With a table of 9 people, the bill came out to be a little over $100 and we were all stuffed.  I only wish that they had a bigger selection than the usual and standard fare. I guess they covered all the basics.   Decent food. Good service. Comparable prices. Nice alternative to Pho.",

The buffet had a long line and we did  not wanted to wait that long so we decided  to try this restaurant.  The second  we walked in, we felt uncomfortable and not welcome at all.  I did not know why may be because is an open concept the makes you feel like you are in a banquet hall.  Who knows.  We sat down, they did greet us, all they ask...something  to drink? Very rude and short.  How about hi how are you? Can I offer you something  to drink? Would you like some  tea? No! Nothing we barely  got water.   Well then we got our food.  Surprisingly this is why I gave them 2 stars because  the food was yummy  We had to ask for the check and the girls kept looking  at the card as if it was fake.    The whole  time we just wanted to eat fast and get out of there ASAP.   Their customer service is selective and they do not treat everyone with the same manner.  Ironically, we were ready to drop a lot of money for our dinner, but instead we ordered very minimum and left them not tip.  Your tip needs to be earned  based and your customer service.",

Unfortunately he did not tell me that the dim sum standards in  Las Vegas were so low.   I give them a 4 for getting me a place to sit quickly however after that the points go down quickly. It was over 5 minutes before a waitress came by and asked if I wanted something to drink.   The carts though plentiful only came by one out of four times.  The overall selection was somewhat limited and the flavors (or lack of) were not even close to the levels that got me to love dim sum. The chicken feet were undercooked and no flavor. The ribs were more fat then meat and again flavor lacking.  The shrimp were just average.   My recommendation is to go down to Spring Mountain Rd and try another type of Asian food which has much better flavors. There are a lot there with much higher quality, fetter taste and good prices.  So eat well Vegas but just by here.   T",

First clue, it is PACKED with people waiting for a table. Fresh Dim Sum offerings travel through the dining room on carts by a crew of staff. If you have a special request or item you are looking for, just ask and the servers spring into action to find it for you. Our drinks never went empty and the quality dim sum for the price was shocking! I pay double for dim sum in San Francisco. Couple of tips., you can gain entrance to KJ by the parking lot of the RIO and avoid walking through the casino. It is open 24 hours on Saturday nights so you can always get your fix. And they do take out orders!!! If you want a quick bite late at night, swing by grab some yummy steamed delights and head on out. I would definitely recommend it and will be back for more pork buns!

For a place with Dim Sum in the name, that advertises hours of 10 am- 2 am you would think they served Dim Sum all day.  Settled for the chinese food instead, Chow Fun, Mongolian Beef and Sweet N Sour Pork (figured I could spice it up with chili paste and make it taste similar to Szechuan which I prefer).got back to my room only to discover they gave me fried rice instead of Chow Fun, but I was too tired to go back. Not that it would have mattered because it was all so bland. Even the pork! I mean, how hard is it to make Sweet n Sour Pork. The fried rice was nothing but white rice layered with raw cabbage, julienned white onions and beef cubes. No sesame oil, no soy, no carrots, no flavor. Even the chili paste was bland. If this is the top in Vegas I'd hate to see what the rest are like.",

    "text": "The Skinny: okay dim sum, okay prices (3), service: IMHO, it's okay, comfortable seating (3) value: it's not bad for dim sum(3).  We don't really eat dim sum in Las Vegas. The reason is that the dim sum here ain't that good in town. Considering the number of Chinese tourists, you'd expect things to be a lot better than they are. That being said, if someone has a hankering for dim sum, we generally come here for the more comfortable seating arrangements and the slight edge it has on the food.  Don't get me wrong, it's nothing really special. I'll be the first to admit that the meatballs have been mixed with too much cornstarch. The cheung fun has way too much rice noodle compared to the meat filling. All the meat items kind of taste the same. Oh and the XLB come in little foil cups which = not good in my books - and the fact that they serve XLB in the first place but that's another story. The pinepple bun/runny egg yolk buns often leak too and they look exactly (suspiciously) the same as the ones that you get @ East Ocean. Hmmmm....  I'll be the first to admit though, their sweet tofu is a guilty pleasure and I usually get an order of this because I'm a sucker for fresh sweet tofu.  Shove all that aside and consider where that we are in the dim sum desert here in Las Vegas. All things considered, this place gets a 3-starred review - it's okay for what it is, it's reasonably priced and it's more comfortable than other establishments.",

Service was 3-star at best and the food was 4-star.  Overall 3.5 star. Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) and Sie Mai (pork dumplings) were above average.  Would not order the fried rice, fried noodle or other dishes not in the carts.  Those items were really just ok.",

The service, as with most Chinese restaurants, was fast and clipped without much friendliness.  Due to the earliness, there weren't a ton of carts out yet. We ordered our usuals of dumplings and shumais along with chicken feet, tripe, and pork buns. There were no vegetables out yet, which was a bummer as we were looking forward to some Chinese broccoli.   Overall, the food was not as I would've expected. Dim Sum back in Virginia was definitely better than the dim sum here. I think I would only go back for cravings but otherwise it's not something that needs to be checked off on your travels through the hotels.",

    "text": "Yay for Dim Sum! We were pretty excited. Both myself and my friend were on the hunt for good Dim Sum, having eaten it in SF and NYC. So, after asking for suggestions, I decided it was time to give KJ a whirl.  We were seated immediately and offered beverages (water and hot tea). The carts were slow to visit our table, but it was forgiven after I finally got some food in my belly. It was a bit difficult to understand the employees describing items, but fortunately I knew what I wanted. It did create an issue when I asked questions or requested specific items and I received the wrong information or wrong items. I asked three times if the cart had TURNIP Cake and I was given Taro Cake without realizing it. I asked for Shrimp Shumai, but I was given Shrimp Ha Gao. I asked for Char Siu Bao and I got a confused look. It felt like they weren't even listening or attempting.  Anyway, we really enjoyed the Char Siu Bao, Shanghai Dumplings, Shrimp Ha Gao, Fried Shrimp Wanton, Turnip Cake, Beef Rice Noodle, Chow Mein, and Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun. They were all SO, SO delicious. Extremely filling, but I could've just kept eating.  The prices are wonderful as well and just such a fun atmosphere. I love small plates type of eating, no matter the cuisine. Yum! I would highly recommend the dishes above and go with at least three people since most of the plates have 3-4 pieces. Also, you're able to try even more!",

We went on a Monday night and it was relatively not crowded, compared to the amount of patrons on the casino floor and people waiting to check into the hotel. Service was fast and pleasant, though we got some strange looks coming with all our climbing gear. We were too hungry and lazy to wait in the 30 person deep line to check into the Rio.  Everything tasted a little bland, from the hot and sour soup to the honey walnut shrimp to the sweet and sour chicken. The shrimp and chicken were a little soggy. All our food came out really quickly though, so that was a plus.  In the words of my boyfriend, \"We should have just gone to Panda Express.\"",

Came back a few minutes later and tells me I should just cancel the lobster egg roll because the cook doesn't want to make it. He's too busy with a four table banquet dinner to bother with us. WTF!! Get this! There is only 6 other people, us included, besides that four table banquet. It usually is not in my nature to complain. But, this pissed me off. I went and talked to the manager. Informed him what the waiter told us. Asked him is this normal business practice to have the cook refuse to make a dish because he doesn't feel like it! As I finished paying the bill, no tip, they come out and tell me the cook is making my egg roll now. Are you kidding me. I told them they can eat it themselves and left. Not coming back.",

The noodles that my cousin ordered came at the very end, when we were paying for the bill.  And the noodles weren't anything special.  Reminded me of Pick up Stix or Panda Express noodles.  I also noticed when walking out, the ladies w/the cart had different items that were not offered while we dined.  Sucks because I didn't have a variety.  I have been to 2 dim sum spots in Vegas.

The portions of everything except for the noodles were tiny. Everything tasted very okay and was nothing special, but was so expensive. Our waiter also asked us in the beginning if we wanted anything to drink and we said water. He asked us if we wanted tea too and we said sure! (Asian restaurants almost always give tea for free unless otherwise specified) They ended up charging us for a pot of tea without saying anything. When we told them about it, they said they would remove it, but it felt pretty sneaky that they didn't say anything about it costing money when they specifically asked us if we wanted it. Overall, was not a fan of this restaurant at all as I've been to so many great Asian places.",

Since I love the first KJ Kitchen location on Spring Mountain and Jones, we decided to try the second location. So far, I love my other dim sum restaurant than KJ and here are the reasons why.  First of all, we came in on Wednesday, September 13 , 2017 around 10:30 a.m. We were greeted and seated. There wasn't a lot of people in the dining room until 11:30 a.m. Instead of drinking random drinks, we drinked traditional with our dim sum, hot tea.  We ordered: - Har Gow - Chicken Feet - Shu Mai - Lo Mai Gai (Sticky rice with meat and egg) - Char Siu Bao (Steamed BBQ Bun) - Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll  We had to wait about 20 more minutes for more different dim sum food to come out. We also ordered: - Char Siu Bao (Baked BBQ Bun) - Coconut Bun - Egg tart - Fried Dumpling - Fried Spinach Dumpling  Some of the foods were ok. The variety was small and not as big. Each dish costs over $2.99 each! The service was alright, I was happy that they served us but not in a happy way. I recommend to go somewhere else to eat dim sum. Other dim sum restaurants probably charge less for each dish and way bigger portion than KJ in the Rio.",

It's located right next to the Rio buffet. I think KJ took over where the bowling alley used to be. Once you're inside, it's pretty spacious and doesn't seem like you're dining inside of a freaking casino. There are ladies pushing carts of dim sum around, which to me, adds a bit of authenticity to it.  The food itself was alright. However. I thought the food was a bit salty for my liking though, but it was good given how hungry I was. The dim sum food itself was authentic enough and it wasn't added with some fusion mix to it like a lot of the other Chinese restaurants on the strip do.  I haven't had dim sum in Vegas before so I can't really compare it to any other place, but I would definitely come back if I'm ever in Vegas again and am craving for some dim sum. The prices were very reasonable, so that's another plus.",

Their menu had some listings for Dim Sum and Vegetable items, but we should have walked away when we noticed that TWO of those items had meat listed with them (one featured oysters, the other listed pork. Last time I looked at a 'Food Pyramid,' neither of those met the qualification for being classified as vegetables.)  But we had both been driving all day, so we figured that we could order some dishes we'd had elsewhere before: I ordered szechuan bean curd and my husband ordered deep fried bean curd, Chinese restaurants around the country feature these dishes so it should be pretty standard, right?   So who's brilliant fucking idea was it to stuff SHRIMP into a VEGETARIAN DISH without telling a paying customer? If it was one chunk that happened to land on the plate by accident, then I could understand that. But that's not what happened, there was shrimp stuffed dead-center inside every single block of fried bean curd on his plate. Every. Single. ONE. When I saw and smelled the shrimp in his food, I stopped eating mine immediately.  We reported this place to the management at Rio.",

They were all pretty delicious and generous family style portions. There really wasnt anything to complain about.  One thing was the orange beef could have been crispier, some people like it soft and tender and other people like light batter and crispy.

The carts were already flowing so we were hopeful. Service was slow at first, no one brought us water or tended to us besides the cart ladies. We had to flag down a server who looked less than please to serve us. After that little hitch, it was fine. They have your typical assortment...congee, chicken feet, shumai, dumplings, pork ribs...they were all pretty good. What was disappointing was they didn't have anything else ready..not even rice! We couldn't even order anything from the menu. Don't make the mistake of being hangry and going as early as we did.",

At times, we didn't know what was being offered, but our server was a very good guide. My favorite was the sweet BBQ steamed buns and the fried rice. Honestly though, it was all good.

    "text": "SUMMARY: Apparently this is a popular spot for dim-sum; my NON-dim-sum experience was pretty underwhelming.  THE UGLY DETAILS: I am passing away my morning at The Rio, while an auto shop across the street is installing new seating leather in my car. It's a Thursday at 11:30am. This venue has about 70 table-tops. And, except for a couple of the 12-tops, this place is full to the brim. Almost entirely with Asians. And I mean local Asians, not tourists. And they are all here for the dim-sum carts. When they could have gone just two blocks over into Chinatown for their dim-sum. To me, that speaks volumes regarding the quality of the dim-sum here.  I was seated promptly, to an egg-white tablecloth 2-top. One paper napkin and some plastic chops are my only table-mates, no salt, pepper, soy or rooster. I will be truly be dining alone. The entire staff, not surprisingly, were also Asian. My servers had accents so thick, I could only understand a word here and there, and they chattered away at the speed-of-light. Hence the direction that my meal was actually taking evolved into a bit of a mystery.  Again, I was only one of two tables that was not entirely Asian. The other was four WSOPers who were already drunk. Meaning they were already eliminated from the tournament in the early rounds. Yet they were taking turns trying to verbally out-blab one another with their insightful poker observations of the other players. General Custer graduated last-place in his competition at West Point - but he also got eliminated first at the Little Big Horn. All of you lost. Babble on about how THAT played out. And drop the testosterone talk. Then maybe you'll be better poker players down the road.  The menu is over-priced, again not entirely a surprise given this is inside a casino property. The cheapest meals on the menu were Mongolian Beef or Kung Pao Chicken, $17 a plate. A bowl of Wonton soup, get this, $15. Maybe it was a bowl the size of Viet pho, but so what? It's still step-sis to chicken noodle soup. Most of the plates were in the $20s, $30s. $40s for duck. I went with the Kung Pao. And two egg rolls at $9.  \"No egg rolls. Spring rolls.\" Ok, so it's spring rolls. Rapid-fire unintelligible chatter. I think he's telling me that's going to be $10. Or maybe $10 MORE. I can't tell. I ask if the Kung Pao comes with fried rice. More rapid-fire unintelligible chatter. I think the answer is yes, for $1 more. \"Fry rice what?\" I say pork. The menu doesn't have a single beverage listed on it, not even hot tea, so I figured those prices were stealth so as to be outrageous - and stuck with water.  The spring rolls appear in under two minutes. Fried not fresh, three of them. They are warm outside, cold inside. That means they got nuked to find their half-life on my table. Meh.  Then the Kung Pao. With a side of white rice. I say I thought I got ordered the fried rice. More rapid-fire unintelligible chatter. I think now he is jotting down a full order of fried rice which is going to come in at nearly $20. I signal to stop, saying I will just eat what I have.  When he leaves, I see him go consult with his peers, all looking back at my table, apparently discussing my unusual ordering habits. What with me wanting egg rolls and a side of fried rice in a Chinese restaurant and all. Instead of eating conger eel and whatever off the carts.  The Kung Pao is bland. Really bland. It's no more tasty than what I can get round the corner at my local take-out joint. If that tasty. Not bad, just bland. The portion is what I would call a bit less than average. Now I am thinking it's a durn good thing I didn't go with dim sum, because I would have had no idea what any item was going to cost ... and so I could have easily ended up with some kind of three-digit tab for lunch.  When I got back out into the casino, I was still hungry. And I mean immediately, not in an hour. I caught myself wishing I had tried a Philly Steak at the Sports Book instead.  RECOMMENDATION: All these Asian customers are probably not wrong, so the dim-sum is probably pretty good. I mean it all even looked good. So if you are down for dim, it's likely worth investing in your own evaluation. But for non-dim sum, steer clear and just head up the street to Chinatown.",

    "text": "Breakfast plans on the Strip fell through today, and my awesome plan B was to take my mom to one of Henderson's new brunch hotspots. I wish that I'd stuck to that instead of making an impromptu detour to try out this nearby restaurant.  KJ Dim Sum & Seafood is conveniently located near the Valley View entrance of the Rio. Just park outside (assuming that's allowed/available) or in the \"Carnival\" parking garage and it's a quick walk that won't even take you by any slot machines.  Today was the Monday following Easter weekend, and peak lunch was exceedingly busy. I would guess that the vast majority of their clientele today was Chinese tourists. We had a roughly 20-minute wait for a table for two (important: keep the \"raffle\" ticket which the host gives to you). After we were seated, we received a small a la carte menu, which we simply ignored. The dim sum carts arrived promptly.  My favorites today were the cheong fun (rice noodle rolls with shrimp) and the egg tart. The rice noodles were fluffy and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The sauce complemented the dish just right. Make sure they cut it into smaller pieces for you. The egg tart was one of my last bites, and even though I was full (and bored with the other items), my taste buds were thrilled. The flaky crust and hot egg custard that unexpectedly started to melt on the tongue were fantastic.  The chicken feet were pretty good. I'd order them again. The turnip cake was fine, with a bit of a crisp on the outside and enough seasoning throughout that it might be enjoyed on its own. The har gow (shrimp dumplings) were tasty, but the shell was too easily torn apart, making it hard to fish out of the metal container.  That's about all that I'd reorder from today's choices. The shu mai was disappointingly bland for some reason. The shrimp balls were even worse. They were too hard and something was very off about the interior. Either there was too much flour, or the shrimp was too mushy. It just wasn't the typical juicy shrimp interior, and the mayo sauce should not have been wholly necessary to rescue the shrimp. Finally, I'd have to classify the taro dumplings as another letdown. They were smaller than expected, and not as flavorful. I appreciate that they weren't dripping with oil, but that's not why I eat dim sum.  Prices are were $2.28-$3.98 per dish, and $1.00 per person for hot jasmine tea. Service was surprisingly decent, with quick responses to such concerns as lack of soy and XO sauces on the table, requests for a to-go box, and closing the check. All of these were positives, but not enough to outweigh the boredom of the majority of the meal.  KJ Dim Sum just didn't live up to their reputation. This would be a 7/10 if I could rate it that way. I don't get decimals in this 5-star scale, and the disappointments today outweighed the few positives, so I'm saddened but content to round it down. I'd easily stop by again to ask for egg tarts and possibly cheong fun to-go, and that's about it.",

Admittedly a 'standardized' menu featuring solid renditions of the classics but little innovation it would be easy for me to dock points for issues such as tepid duck or small, slightly overcooked shrimp but taking into account the nature of cart service compared to the menu style common to the elite of the SGV or BC nearly every dish we selected was nicely prepared and ample in portion, the total bill for 11 selections ringing in at $45 before tax and tip.  Speaking to specific must orders, particular favorites particularly well done would include both the baked salty egg yolk buns and the even more impressive steamed version of the same, but most of all the golf-ball sized crispy shrimp balls served along semi-sweet Chinese mayo sauce - the rich, supple interior so good a second order for 'dessert' proved mandatory.",

In Las Vegas!  What more can you ask for?  I know a lot of tourist might come to this restaurant because they just happen to drop by but please don't compare the Chinese food and the prices here to places in LA, NY, SF, or even HK.  It's because I know food is much, and cannot be compared other chinese restaurant in a desert.  Moving on...  I like their Turnip cake, chicken feet, egg tart, and bbq pork buns.    I'm sure I will be back at this place for more dimsum in the near future.    Prices A - $2.28 B - $3.18 C - $3.98 I don't know what their special price is. (sorry)  FYI - Har Gow and Siu Mai is in the B category.   Their Speciality is Lao Sa Bao - also in B category.  This Lao Sa Bao is the exclusive bake bun at the restaurant and cannot be found anywhere else in the Valley.  It taste like Custard Bun but it's made with real egg yolk.  I strongly reccomend anyone to visit this place. I would SO much rather eat this than the buffet across!",

Recommending chicken feet, egg tart, tofu nao, shrimp with needle mushroom and sandy bun, which is soft yolk bean paste ish inside, smelling really good and taste really good. The tea, we ordered Xiang Pian, one kind of green tea. The quality is bad, the water is not clear looking and it doesn't smell as good as regular Xiang Pian, it's a big disappointment. But it's much more expensive, 2.8 ish for small plates. 3.39 for medium plate and 3.99 for large ones. And for kitchen made plate it will be 10.95. It's really pricy for dim sim.  I might come again bc the food is good and I no longer live in LA. Otherwise, based on the price and tea, I don't really want to.",

Quality of the dim sum here is SO much better than the ones in Chinatown, so why bother going far off the strip? Food here actually reminds me of eating dim sum in hong kong! and it's on par with other authentic dim sum restaurants in San Gabriel Valley, where all the asians are. You must get the melting custard bun! Don't hesitate, just grab it because it sells out within a minute, no joke!! Don't repeat my mistake of just ordering one and realize it's sooo good that you want more. THERE WON'T BE ANY LEFT and you'll have to wait another 20 minutes :(  The only reason why this did not get five stars because I'm too cheap to eat here all the time.

    "text": "I stayed at the Rio multiple days for a conference and found that this was a tasty and refreshing change after eating at their All-American Bar and Grille one time too many. Don't get me wrong the Grille's food was good, but the thought of eating another burger was nauseating.    The food at KJ is authentically Chinese and they serve a good variety as any restaurant in the San Gabriel Valley. The couple times I ate here was for lunch and dinner so I didn't get any dim sum, but the quality and tastiness really hit the spot for someone who grew up on Chinese food. There are also favorites that are suitable for others that are not too familiar with Chinese food. I recommend the Beef Chow Fun and Won Ton Noodle soup.  They even accommodated my dining partner who was allergic to some ingredients, when requested to not add any sauce to a shrimp dish and to simply steam it they complied.    The only reason why this place is not getting a 5 star is because of the price of their dishes. Everything else service, decor and food is up-there. I know there are many options to dining in Vegas, but not for Chinese so maybe that's why this place can profit from increased prices.",

It really is frustrating when it takes around 5-10 minutes to get a small serving. The atmosphere is also very loud, and the plates and tea cups are not always clean, sometimes there are still food chunks still stuck to it. There are almost 10 employees at any given moment \"serving the customers\" but I barely got \"served\". There is a 30 minute wait for a pathetic amount of food. But overall, it's a alright place. When they do give you food, it's good quality.",

Yes I know the customer may not always be right, but arguing is not okay.  I would not recommend this place is you are looking for good service.

It was weird to have a Mexican waiter asked us what kind of tea we wanted to drink.  We sat for over 10-15 minutes and only two carts came by our table with nothing of interest to us.  We were really disappointed with their food service or lack of it.  The dim sum was okay, but not a very wide selection of dim sum to choose from.  There were a lot of items that were missing from the usual dim sum fare.  We didn't see any desserts carts at all.  The taste wasn't bad, but definitely not as good as those dim sum restaurants in L.A.  So only 3.5 stars from me.",

This is where the problem is.  Being Asian and knowing what dim sum is supposed to taste like... sigh.  There were a lot of Asians in here (Asians, not Asian-Americans... yes, I mean fobs :P)... but that's probably because they were craving food from the motherland.  The shu mai... bland, small, and the texture was just kind of weird.   Rather than small chunks of shrimp/pork... it was like they just threw pork and shrimp in and processed it together...  The chicken feet was not bad.  But it wasn't as soft as I like.  Maybe that's a preferential thing.  It felt like it wasn't that fresh.  Maybe that was the problem with the texture.  Spare ribs with black beans.  Again, flavorless.  It was the typical meat:fat ratio you get at most cheap dim sum restaurants (read: cheap, high fat, low in meat).  But again, the meat itself was very bland.  My buddies had the rice noodle wrapped in shrimp, i opted to just try the rice noodle wrapped in bbq pork.  The rice noodles weren't bad, but the meat... lets just say I think the meat:fat ratio was again off (read: STOP FEEDING ME SO MUCH FAT!!!)  This was also very flavorless.  We got the bbq pork buns.  My buddies did not seem to enjoy that either... and they eat anything.  To sum it up:  I think this restaurant was catered towards non-Asians.  Food lacked bold Asian flavors typically savored and it was a huge disappointment.  I think the dim sum that they offer in the Rio World Buffet would've more satisfied my craving.  And no, I'm not exaggerating on that.",

I heard there is a new one at the Palms which I have yet to try. Food is always hot here. The tripe is soft and not chewy. All the basics look perfect, never sitting too long, and always soft, no stale edges.   This might sound stupid but I love this place because they are nice to my girlfriend who is American and not Chinese and they don't bring the forks anymore. We like to sit by the kitchen door.  I read reviews on here about service. Never eaten dinner time here but who needs service for dim sum. Bring tea, that's it. In China we have to get up and get our own dim sum, no carts.",

If you haven't seen that \"Dirty Dining\" segment, better check it out!  Everyone has their opinion on dim sum , and KJ is still in my top 3. They are fast, there are a lot of items to choose from, and from my experience here, they always got different things on the cart I haven't seen or tried. After grubbin' on some savory offerings, the dessert cart comes around and I grab my usual Rice Cakes and there are these buns with a white crunchy topping, so wifey asks about it and we find out they are Taro Buns. We get them, and it was love at first bite! They weren't real taro root though, it was purple sweet potato, and they were BOMB!  After paying our bill and on our way out, I spied similar looking buns on a cart and asked the lady what they were...They also have Green Tea Buns too which is another excuse to return!  ALOHA!!!

KJ Dim Sum is my absolute favorite place in Vegas to get dim sum.  I consider myself to be picky when it comes to dim sum, we just moved here from California and we were spoiled with many heavy hitter dim sum restaurants close to home. Since we've moved here, we've tried almost all of the popular dim sum restaurants in Vegas: Orchid Garden (2/5), Chang's (3/5), Cathay House (3/5) and also Ping Pang Pong (3/5). Yet, I would still easily recommend KJ dim sum as sum' of the best dim sum in Vegas!   It's located inside of the Rio, right across the way from the Carnival World Buffet. We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday. They were bustling but we didn't have to wait, they were able to seat us right away. They were quick with rolling the carts by and were quick to grab us our drinks and tea. I was extremely pleased with the service here.   Now let's get on to the best part, the food!   Shumai - they were very moist and had great flavor. A nicely done shumai for sure. 5/5  Har gow - so much yum! They make them amazing here. Super delicate clear wrapper and steamed to perfection. The shrimp inside tasted amazing. I can eat 10 orders of these! 5/5  Fried taro puffs - these were little fried fluffs of taro. The taro filling tasted good and the exterior was fried well and flaky. 5/5  Bbq pork bun - the buns were small, glazed and sticky. The bbq pork filling inside was just enough but super flavorful and moist. We enjoyed them! 5/5  Bbq pork bao - (the one that looks like white clouds) it was piping hot and steamy, very fluffy, and the filling was moist. The bbq pork flavor is great! We devoured these little morsels and also saved some to eat later as well. They were still amazing after siting in the container and at room temperature. 5/5  Shrimp noodle rolls - these were perfect! I enjoyed the soft, moist and tender noodles. The shrimps inside were flavorful as well. 5/5  Egg custard tart - I was completely taken back by how they stayed warm at our table the entire time! It was extra custardy, super crazy moist, velvety buttery, and very flaky. I was in heaven! Omg. It's the best egg custard tart we have ever had! I grew up eating these babies in California, but man these win them all. 5/5   Total damage with a coke was $25! That's a good price for 2 hungry adults. We love this place!",

Was happy that the carts come by pretty much once you set down and they keep coming around. They have most of the usual dim sum dishes which I love. Also recommend the vegetable dumplings that's on the same cart of the Baos not Sui Mai cart. They also have a menu.   Not overly priced for a casino's dim sum. Left spending under $45.

Quality about the same as dim sum places in San Diego but selection a bit limited.  However price is quite a bit cheaper.  What we ordered would cost $60+ in SD but just $42 here.  We definitely would consider going back if next time feeling dim sum in LV.  Parking is a breeze as Rio's parking lot is just outside.",

Upon arriving, we were sat immediately and offered tea, water or beer. Once we knew what we wanted, we put the order in. About 6 minutes later the food started arriving fast. Here is the scoop on our food....  Spring rolls....tightly wrapped and super delicious.  Hot and sour soup...huge bowl, best I have ever had..took some home.  Scallops with seasonal greens....omg! So good and so many scallops, had broccoli cooked perfectly with mushrooms, onions and red pepper flakes...so good.  Beef tenderloin app...different as the beef is chilled and sliced thin. Comes with pickled veggie strips that are amazing.  Sweet and sour chicken...huge portion and so tasty.  You can get a bowl of steamed rice for $1.00 as a base .  The servers are quick and polite though not overly friendly ( they were busy) .  The decor is nice and room comfortable.  I took off one star as they did not offer even fortune cookies for desert and did not seem very welcoming ( again maybe because they were busy) but for the price, the could offer fortune cookies after the meal.  I will for sure be back though.",

The congee was amazing, it came with black eggs (love this in my congee) and they topped it off with Chinese donut and green onions... No other dim sum places I know does this, another plus.

However, the menus offers more choices.  Went there three days in a row during the recent Vegas trip.  Must get - Roast Duck, Fried Rice, House special daily soup, Beef with Vegetables.  Must try - shrimp dumpling, shumai, chicken feet (for lunch/dimsum).  Usually the waits are not too bad except lunch times for dim sum.  It is cheaper or on par with the dim sum restaurants in LA.

We didn't even have any leftovers. My parents commented that the food flavor was good and pretty authentic for the most part.  Also, the waiters spoke Chinese, which is nice. I am usually most skeptical at Chinese restaurants when the waiters don't speak Chinese.  The beef chow fun (gan chao niu he) was pretty on par with what I'm used to. The flavors were good, noodles were plentiful.  The yang chou fried rice was a little too wet for my liking but the flavor was good. It had shrimp (ew) and bits of egg in it. I just wish the rice were a little drier.  The chicken and broccoli looked a bit off (not quite Americanized but not quite what I was expecting). The chicken looked a little grey. But the sauce was good, especially on the broccoli.",

Dim sum is served 10am-3pm everyday.  Find me there from 10am-3pm.  Hoo yah!  (I wish)  Service is pretty quick and efficient, once one gets going.  Getting started is a bit of problem.   I sat there for 10 mins before someone took my drink order, then the ticket was set...and the old ladies with carts started flowing.  The Xiao Long Bao were near 4.5 amazing, and the Potstickers and Shu Mai was a flat 4.0 star.  Price was a little high, as I was out the door for $20.  BTW - you must ask for \"Xiao Long Bao\", as \"Juicy Pork Dumplings\" will get you nowhere.  Hit the spot in the tummy labeled \"dim sum only\".  All the chips are in, this is a giddy-up!",

    "text": "A friend and I were looking for a place to grab dinner before attending the Chippendales show located in the same casino/hotel (try not to judge, it's Vegas after all)  The buffet directly across from KJ had a 25 minute wait, and who really wants to wait for a buffet?  We turn around and lo and behold there was KJ Dim Sum & Seafood restaurant with several tables available.  We were seated quickly and the servers gave us plenty of attention.  We ordered and the food came quickly.  We were surprised that the dishes were relatively inexpensive.  We had a little time to look around and enjoy the atmosphere.  The restaurant is decorated in bright and cheery reds - red carpet with what appears to be butterflies fluttering about the floor.  The carpet contrasts with the shiny black chairs and the white walls which are covered with large black frames filled with brightly colored pictures and 4 flatscreen televisions.  It's not quite enough to convince you that you're in a sports bar, but they get the job done.  There were four occupied tables near us. At three of the tables the occupants were  speaking Chinese and eating Chinese style (eating rice out of the bowl, and other items off their plates).  I always have more faith in the quality of the food at an ethnic restaurant when at least some of the other customers belong to the ethnic group.  DJ Dim Sum definitely makes the grade in this respect.  First they brought the potstickers, hot and tasty - perfectly done, then the egg flower soup.  The coconut shrimp was pretty tasty and in no time we were on our way, tummies full and taste buds satisfied.  I'd definitely come back!!",

The restaurant should hire more servers,  all of them looked very busy although there was not many tables occupied. Because our server was too busy, we tried to call the cashier and she eye contacted me, but completely ignored me.

I've seriously never had this level of service in any Asian restaurant, especially dim sum.  My ice water never reached the half way point.  They even came by and asked how I was doing and if there were any dishes that I would like to request.  Everyone there is super friendly and accommodating.    Another big shocker..  their prices are super reasonable.  Our party of 4 indulged, and our bill came to a whopping $72, which at similar places would have been well over $100.  The food quality is very high.  While I would love to give detailed descriptions of each dish, as a white girl I have no idea what their proper names are.  They do have a pretty decent selection of all of the standard fare and even some additional taro choices that are banging.  Dim sum isn't served all day long, only 10a-3p.",

I find that other places lack certain things like the fried taro, fried shrimp balls, sticky rice, and the steamed tofu wrap filled with chicken. Prepare yourself for an MSG-induced food coma because this meal will knock you out no matter how much tea you knock back.  Of course, given that they're located inside a casino, their prices are higher than a typical dim sum. Their spacious dining area is clean and decorated well, yet still has the atmosphere and buzz of a traditional Chinese restaurant. With all the waiters and pushcart ladies quickly making their rounds, their service runs as smooth as the wheels on the metal carts. Be sure to park on the west side of the Rio so the waddle back to the car is shorter!  Though it's a tad more expensive than usual, the scrumptious food and tip-top service solidify its claim on the best dim sum in Vegas in my book. Now if you'll excuse me, it's time for me and my happily full stomach to rest and digest.",

    "text": "So my new husband and I decided to try out a dim sum place close to the strip because it's a novel idea, dim sum in Vegas!  When we got there the place was busy and most patrons were asian, great sign! We were seated right away and got bombarded with carts (of course).  Here's a breakdown of what we ended up with: -har gow -shu mai -rice noodles with shrimp -mushroom dumplings -char siu bao (steamed pork bun) -sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf -xiao long bao -scallop dumplings  Of what we got here's what I would recommend, xiao long bao, har gow, and mushroom dumplings. The rest where okay and some were not that great. The notable bad dish was the rice noodles with shrimp, which was definitely off. For the noodle dish, usually the shrimp is especially sweet and the noodles are wrapped up but separate. These noodles seemed overcooked because half of the noodles seemed to have fused together.  We get darn good dim sum at home, so this was a little bit of a let down. I'm also tempted to take away another star for service because even though we were seated promptly and got our food quickly it took FOREVER to get our bill and after getting it for someone to take it. However, I am in a generous mood so I'll say that they get a 2.5 and round up to 3.  Kj Dim Sum will definitely satisfy a dim sum craving, but it's not that great. Not sure what else Vegas has to offer in terms of dim sum, but hopefully it's better than this.  Star #1: Flavorful food. Some of them were good, some not so good. Star #2: Food causes cravings. No, not these ones. Star #3: Price worthiness. Yes, decently priced dim sum. Star #4: Decent service. It's okay. Star #5: X factor (ie amazing service, ambiance, creativity, etc). Not really.",

First impressions mean a lot, and Kj made a good one, the decor is beautiful. The tables in the dining area are spaced out well. It was easy to carry a conversation in the room. Service was attentive and friendly.   My husband had the Mongolian Beef, spicy. Wasn't very at all spicy, but the meat was tender and obviously good quality. I had the chicken with cashews, which was excellent. We also split some tasty desserts.   I recieved 20% off our bill as a local... which is cool but I could have sworn that lady that gave me my rewards card for the Rio said I'd get 25% off all the restaurants... The website also states locals get 25% off:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riolasvegas.com%2Fcasinos%2Frio%2Fcasino-misc%2Flocals-home-detail.html&s=f51a65a81fad88bb47b60e4906b197eb9a7c39dc5d8f4421c9a269a6d89ddb21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">riolasvegas.com/casinos/...</a>  For 3 people we only paid $50, and that was with a tip...  I'd like to return sometime for lunch to see how the dim sum carts are. Until then I am sticking with an A-OK, 3 star rating.",

    "text": "My mom is an old school Chinese lady who would eat Chinese, more specifically, Cantonese food, everywhere if she could choose. On this recent mother-daughter trip to Vegas, I knew I had to find a way to include this somewhere in the itinerary, and luckily my Vegas local friend pooky b highly recommended KJ.    Located inside the Rio, across from the Carnival World Buffet, this Cantonese cuisine restaurant that's been opened for only two months offered just what we needed: delicious and better yet, reasonably-priced dim sum for lunch. I'm very impressed by how the steamed items were seriously piping hot and fresh, with a good amount of variety to choose from. Of the things we tried, shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, tripe, beef wrapped in flat rice noodle, tofu flower dessert, pan-fried shrimp and chive dumplings, they all tasted absolutely fabulous, maybe even exceeding the flavors of some dim sum restaurants in San Francisco.   My only gripe is that if you are a solo non-native diner, the cart ladies may easily pass you up. You really have to be assertive if you want them to stop by your table. Other than that, service was pretty good and I'm sure my mom really enjoyed it, which was the most important thing. She liked it so much that she even took a stack of business cards to bring home to distribute to her friends!",

My friend had arrived before me, and had already ordered a bunch of food, so I dug right in.   The dim sum places in Vegas aren't spectacular compared to other places I've been to, but are still pretty decent. KJ's is no exception. The food was mediocre but service was better here than any other dim sum place in Vegas that I've been to.   So, while the food was alright... I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon. I would rather stick to the ones I already go to. Mainly because there wasn't anything that really wowed me enough to want to have to deal with tourists and the rio parking garage.",

    "text": "KJ Kitchen in Rio is arestaurant with an upscale, very comfortable decor but moderate prices for absolutely delicious Dimsums and other Chinese dishes! If you like the original KJK in Chinatown, you'll love this NEW one in Rio.  The YELPY Version:  Yesterday afternoon, my friend and I decided to give the new KJK a try, and was delighted by how good its dimsums (we had 4 different kinds, at $1.50-$3.60 each) and the \"Seafood Noodles\" ($15) tasted! Happy to report that our dimsums were as good as those we had in the best of Chinese dimsum restaurants, and the noodle dish the same quality as that from the ORIGINAL KJK in Chinatown. For our wonderful afternoon meal, the tab was $28, including Tea and Tax.  By the way, the quantity of the dishes was pretty good, too. After all those tasty dimsums, as delicious as the plate of noodles was, we could not finish it, we flipped a coin for the leftover, and darn, my friend won the toss and took it home!  This huge restaurant was ~80% full around 2pm, and we were not surprised. My friend and I are regulars of the original KJK, and we will definitely frequent the NEW one as well - when we have a craving for dimsums and/or want to dine in a more \"plush\", upscale setting.  Although this NEW KJ Kitchen opened only very recently in Rio Casino, its ORIGINAL location in Chinatown has been a favorite for local Asians (and some smart and some \"Well Informed\" Westerners) for years - for its very tasty Chinese dishes at reasonable prices. That small, popular (thus) crowded, original KJK in Chinatown was not well known to most tourists other than those lucky Asians from Los Angeles, however, perhaps because it is NOT listed on the TripAdvisor Network? Now, the NEW KJK in Rio will be a TREAT to the TOURISTS, as well as to the LOCALS! In addition to its traditional, great tasting Chinese dishes that it is famous for, the NEW KJK also offers a variety of delicious dimsums, all at moderate prices, which the original KJK does not.

I like the open air style because I tend to get claustrophobic in Chinese restaurants. No new items here that makes it different from Cathay House, Chang or Orchid Garden.

Since it's located inside Rio across from the Carnival buffet, the prices are a tad bit more expensive than your Spring Mtn options but it's still super cheap unless you are just a cheap ass AzN. All of the dim sum is really fresh, hot, and delish.    I recommend going super early to avoid the traffic and to get the food right when it comes out.

Had visited other restaurants in \"Chinatown\" Spring Mountain Rd. area but were not impressed with what we had in the past ( FYI Sam Woo is the worst !  Very expensive and just plain bad).  Being from Toronto Canada, we're use to good authentic Chinese food.  When I came across KJ DS based on an Internet search, decided to give it a try, and we're glad we did.  In the end, we ended up at the place 3 times during our 5 day visit and we weren't even staying at the Rio hotel ! First visit was actual Dim Sum.  Compared to Toronto, the prices are very reasonable/similar.  Selection at times can be tricky since it all depends on what cart comes by your table.  Within 5 mins of being seated at our table, we had tea & food on the table and we were munching away. Flavor and presentation were good and what you would expect.  We were especially impressed with the BBQ roast duck (skin was really crispy !)  In total our bill for 4 people including tea & tip was around $55. We also went two nights for dinner.  We ordered off the regular and Chinese menus. (You might need to ask for the Chinese menu).  The size of the dishes was good and very tasty.  The selection was also quite impressive and we managed to order dishes which suited all tastes.  Along with our dishes, we received complimentary soup of the day, rice and dessert.  In total our bills were in the $55 range, including tips.  The service on all occasions was really good without being too pushy. Based on our experiences with this level of food and service, we will definitely be back on our next trip to LV.  Give them a try - you won't be disappointed !",

It was so disgusting I couldn't get the pungent taste of off seafood out of my mouth the rest of my night. I was so scared I'd spend the rest of my vacation with food poisoning I ran straight to the rooftop bar and immediately downed a huge shot of vodka and prayed that would sterilize what was undoubtedly festering in my stomach. I've had gas station food that was fresher than this. I know my dim sum and this stuff was not even close! Also the server was very rude.

    "text": "Horrible waitress, horrible management (as in there seems to be only one manager that does not work a full day so I haven't been able to contact him from 3PM-7PM to report the problem.)  I ordered the lobster egg rolls.  Waited 15 minutes before (I think) waitress told me they were out of lobster egg rolls (not exactly sure what the reason was her  English wasn't great..but she blamed the chef.)  My partner was almost finished eating his mongolian beef meal by that time.  My vegetable order- which was placed less than 3 minutes after my partner placed his Mongolian beef order- was also delivered 15 minutes after he was served (again she blamed the chef.).  The final nail on the coffin was I asked a half an hour before my check came to have a mango pudding saved for my dessert. The pudding was on the dim sum menu which ended at 3PM.  Waitress said she would save one.  Then half an hour later I was given the check with no mango pudding.  Had to track down the waitress who said she was already over her shift time and was supposed to leave at 3PM and she said she was told pudding was sold out. I asked her why she didn't save me one as she had promised and she just made excuse after excuse that everything was the chef''s fault and not hers. She didn't want to pull one until I was finished with my meal.  I wasn't offered any discount for the lousy service.  I was told the manager leaves at 3PM for me to make complaints and it was 3:15 at that time. It is now dinnertime and I have again been told the manager isn't there and to call back tomorrow.  Although my baby bok choy in garlic sauce was delicious, both the spring rolls I had substituted for the lobster rolls and my partner's mongolian beef were awful.  The beef was very chewy. The only thing great about the place was the ambience which is much better than KJs original restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd.  Same bad, uncaring  service though. Save yourself the stress.  If you are not Asian and can't speak or understand their lingo it's nothing but frustrating.  Only one person there spoke English well enough to understand and he was outta there by 3PM.",

Hopes were dashed, however, when my party had dinner. No Dim Sum in the evenings despite it being the NAME OF THE PLACE (only from 10a-2p according to our sever, so basically a lunch special; it's no wonder it looks like a ghost town during dinner hours; the reservation was obviously not needed). Along with our other items, we ordered a large order of the ginger chicken, but received the small. Fortunately, we were only charged for the small. Unfortunately, our credit cards were each charged TWICE (once for the pre-tip amount, and once for the full post-tip amount). I've never seen a restaurant do this (and Guy Fieri's in the same hotel didn't do it that same evening when we stopped there for drinks and dessert before going to see Penn & Teller), but we are keeping an eye on our statements to be sure the duplicate charges come off. I would not recommend this place, probably even for Dim Sum (even if the crowd implies it's good) due to the credit card issue.",

We ordered cashew chicken to share. Worst I've ever had. Plus they charge $1 for rice. Really?  Won't ever return here.",

No matter how good a tea you have, it would be ruined by local water. Either that or they are using crappy tea leaves. I think it's a combination of both.

I wouldn't say that there was anything special or unique about their dim sum, however their egg tart and lava buns are possibly the BEST things I have eaten. If I were to choose between the two, the egg tart would win. It has such a flaky and crisp outside yet the inside is soft and melts in your mouth every time you take a bite. It is also very inexpensive compared to most dim sum places I am used to eating at (from the baby area). This is definitely a spot to hit up inside Rio if you are near and want some asian food!",

    "text": "Growing up in the SGV, I can't help but compare KJ to all the other dim sum places I've been to. I'd like to say that KJ has decent quality dim sum (and it's actually probably the best in vegas) with very high quality pricing lol.   Depending on the dish, it falls into different categories: A costs 2.28 B costs 3.18 C costs 3.98 And they charge you a dollar per person for tea.  I've been here twice now, and both times the food has been enjoyable. I particularly like their liu san bao (excuse my butchered pinyin)  I went on Chinese New Year, which was probably my mistake because all of us asians decided to crawl out from all the nooks and crannies of vegas to get dim sum. I wish they had a microphone or a texting system to notify you when it was your turn. Instead, there was only the hostess shouting out numbers in canto and English; so everybody basically huddled around her booth/the entrance of the restaurant. I think that could be made much more efficient. Additionally, the hostess would lead the people to their seats, and while that happened, people waiting in line to get a number would get shuffled around. We were actually waiting at the hostess' table waiting for a number and we got cut by two different people who just interrupted and demanded a number. That's more the patron's fault than the restaurant's, but still it brought a sour taste to my mouth  3.5 stars",

So I left my lame date and reunited with someone else during my Vegas trip. He was staying at the Rio which was a major downgrade from the Delano LOL BUT this gentleman showed me Vegas the right way, where you're not supposed to be in the room anyway so it doesn't matter to much where you stay as long as you have comfort sleeping accommodations LOL.  So after a night/morning on the town we got back to the Rio at 10am , gambled and smoked cigars and finally went to sleep. At 2ish pm we were staaaarving. I wanted Hash house a gogo on the property but these mofos close early. WTF! So I started checking the hours of all the eateries in the Casino. We decided on dim sum.          Came down stairs and walked right on in. No wait, which is nice because we were starving! The service was nice, a little language barrier but overall we understood each other even though we did order something off the cart we didn't want (his fault) LOL. It was some tripe dish and I'm not about that tripe life HAHA. Ok maybe in  Bon bo hue soup but that's about it :p We ordered some dumplings, fried rice and two meat dishes.  Even though I don't recall our items, I recall them all being quite tasty. I was very satisfied and got full fast!     This was a great hangover meal and if I'm in the same predicament  , I'd come back :p",

    "text": "\"At the end of the day I am at peace because my intentions are good and my heart is pure.\"  Let me get to the heart of the matter... KJ is easily the best Dim Sum that I've experienced in Vegas. Formerly, I visited a few spots, mostly Ping Pang Pong, Cathay House, and Orchids...all because I had my heart set on something specific. These establishments often had items I would enjoy, but also would routinely break my heart with other underwhelming items. KJ Dim Sum & Seafood does everything as good or better than the rest. It's not that my heart skipped a beat upon tasting KJ's offerings, but after experiencing several quality items on my first visit I had a change of heart with both my dim sum expectations and my restaurant choice.  I never claimed to be an expert in anything Chinese...but if you'll allow me to wear my heart on my sleeve for a moment, I did read a Wikipedia Page on Dim Sum, so with complete, absolute, and total uncertainty I can tell you that Dim Sum (dmsm; ; ) could maybe, perhaps, and even possibly be translated as: Touching the heart...a gesture from the heart...how it is that one's heart is so...a gift from the heart. The gifts at KJ Dim Sum & Seafood include Har Gau (Shrimp Dumpling), Lau Sa Bao (Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun), Shrimp Rice Noodle, Daan Taat (Egg Custard Tart), Fried Shrimp Balls, Siu Mai (Pork Dumpling), Taro Bun, etc. These are some of my favorites to satisfy my bleeding heart, but if I truly bare my heart, there are many other items I've enjoyed at KJ over several visits as well.  As others have noted you need to time your visit right, so bring some patience and your heart of gold. It is actually better to have to wait in line a little if you are looking for the largest variety and freshest food. This waiting period can be a great chance for a little heart-to-heart with your dinning companions though. When they are busy they obviously turn over more food, so the carts are re-filled quicker. There is also a better variety during the busier times because they know they will find someone willing to take all of the different types of items the kitchen produces. If you're a man after my own heart, this variety is welcomed in dim sum options. In contrast, if you come too early or too late, the food will sit on the carts a little longer and the number of different items made will decrease...and in this case, absence does not make the heart grow fonder.  KJ is known for their food, not their service. Their service has even been know to break your heart from time to time. However, there are levels of service that can be expected. Like many Chinese options at this price point, the service will not be that great. For best service, the faint of heart would do well to bring a Cantonese speaker that doesn't mind being vocal to nearby carts. If you are out of luck there, then ask questions...even a group of white folks can manage to get what their heart's desire without too much difficulty, but you need to be proactive. If you can't be proactive simply say a prayer, cross your heart...and hope to die?...actually just point to things that look good.  So boldly follow your heart as you venture in to KJ Dim Sum & Seafood to eat your heart out! I sincerely hope, from the bottom of my heart, that you enjoy the experience. And if you don't rest assured that dim sum isn't really all that expensive so it won't hurt the bank that much and after all, a heavy purse makes a light heart.  Disclaimer: Sorry to reiterate the heartfelt sentiments so often in this review. I was listening to Crazy on You by Heart at the time of writing.",

I have only come here for lunch for Dim Sum cart services where they circle the restaurant with stacked carts of Dim Sum items for you to select from and satisfy your appetite.  I am fairly well educated on Chinese culture and food but not an expert who regularly enjoys lots of the selections they have to offer. Still what I can tell you is that the Dim Sum offered at KJ is fresh, warm, and simply showcases the ingredients.   Almost all the time we wait for a while for the seating...even though they are fair, as I sit waiting, I sometimes feel inadequate for not speaking fluent Cantonese, but that all changes when we are seated and the Dim Sum carts start rolling our way. Don't be afraid of ordering...just point to the food that excites you and pair your food with some hot tea. They will even tell you what's inside each item if you ask. Do make a point to come here before noon on the weekends and you will have your table in no time.",

I was disappointed that they didn't have more dumplings or the green tea buns. Taste was better than Chang's and Yum Cha. I guess comparable to Ping Pang Pong (which can be inconsistent). We like KJ Kitchen so we will probably be back.   Service: I actually thought the service was very attentive. They refilled our hot water on our tea without asking and also fetched soy sauce and vinegar when requested. Dim sum pushed in carts but there were probably only about 4 different carts. Would like more variety.   Ambiance: elegant, clean and nicely appointed in shades of red.   Location: in The Rio across from Carnival Buffet.",

We ordered the Beef with Mixed Greens & the Orange Peel Chicken with a side of white rice. Overall, the food and service was great but my friend and I were a bit annoyed by our waiter because, we had just literally sat down and just started picking up the drink menus, when he is already barking at us what we want to drink!!! I had to firmly tell him to give us a few minutes to at least glance at the menu!!! The restaurant was not busy & you could tell the waiters were dying to be busy. They kept hovering over our table, anxiously awaiting to bus our table...annoying when you are trying to enjoy your wine & conversation with your dinner companion...minus one star!!! Other than that, I would come back again. The dishes we ate were delicious!!",

It was too late to turn back so we ordered a couple of dishes which included the egg soup, the beef with vegetables, fried squid, and sizzling scallops. The egg soup, sizzling scallops, and fried squid were decent. However the beef with vegetables was sooooo hard to chew to the point where I didn't bother to try it. The food is very bland and needs more flavor/salt. The steam rice was also very hard too.   However, the service provided was wonderful. Maybe because there were only 3 small groups in the restaurant? They continued to check on us and made sure we had refills on the hot tea. So that's why I'm giving them a 3. I will definitely be back to try the dimsum.",

We were staying at the Rio and I was pretty surprised that they had an actual dim sum restaurant there rather than off the strip near Chinatown.    The carts went around pretty frequently with a vast variety of hot and freshly made dishes.  Everything was pretty tasty. My favorites were probably the shiau mai, fried turnip cake, and tripe.  Of course, I also enjoyed their pork and thousand year old egg congee-this always helps cure a hangover. Their portion is prettty small for the congee, so if you're not feeling so well, I suggest one congee per person.  We also ordered their duck and barbeque pork fried rice and fried noodles, all which were fulfilling as well.    Coming from the San Gabriel Valley and having had my share of Dim Sum experiences, I would definitely recommend this place.  Check it out and see for yourself.  Our group left with massive food coma-satisfied and ready for a nap in prep for the evenings debauchery!",

Interior is nice, food selection is pretty standard as with other places.  The food is quick, there are carts constantly circling around a pretty big place. It's quick, it's pretty normal dim sum.    The only part that doesn't give me a reason to give more stars is the service. The younger servers dressed in polo shirts are pretty nice and will do what you ask.  However, we had one lady in the standard button-up and vest. I'm assuming she's been working here for a while.  Well, if you're working at a casino restaurant, you should know how to treat customers.  We asked our server for drinks. They didn't have Pepsi, she said they only had diet pepsi and other sodas. Okay, cool. So we ordered two other sodas and a water. However, when we came out, she only brought one soda and two waters. We said thank you and apologized, and that we actually asked for another soda (and not the second water). So she rolled her eyes, huffed, threw her hands up and said, \"Can you guys order all at once?\" She pointed to the kitchen at the back of the room, (we were seated near the entrance) and continued to say, \"I just came all the way from over there.\", making it seem like getting drinks was sooo hard for her to do.  My dad apologized to her and explained that she must've heard us incorrectly. Before she left to get our soda, my dad apologized again. Not our server. Must be a generational thing for him to apologize to her for the miscommunication, but she definitely should have not given us an attitude about it.",

From the Har Gow's lack of freshness to the overpriced $18 snow pea leaves, this place is just ridiculous. It's brand new so I would assume this is them at their best and their best stinks so much!  This place obviously is biased towards Chinese speaking people. I asked the server if I can order some snow pea leaves, and she said it wasn't available. OK, well, a short while after I see a table getting exactly what I ordered delivered to a Chinese family. I then hailed the server and pointed at it. Well, they served it warm not hot and also it was $18.... Later I checked the menu and it should have been $12.   Vegetable fiasco aside, the dim sum was so bad. Even ruined my dumpling experience. BOOOO. Go next door to Ping Pang Pong cause that's where the good dim sum is in Vegas. This place STINKS!",

Skin was crispy, meat was tender and flavorful. Awesome!  You can find better if you look REALLY hard in Chinatown, but for dim sum, there has been no close second!  The Fried Shrimp Balls. These were easily the BEST I've had! I really don't know how they get ALL that flavor inside, but they are awesome!  Seriously, I have NEVER ordered items to take to-go...usually dim sum is oily and gross reheated....THIS was my first time, and surprisingly, they were actually good the second time around too LOL!  Salt and Pepper Squid. Another winner! This was soo good...so much flavor here, and much better than the shimp version!  If you like this kind of dish, do yourself a favor and order it :P  Shu Mai. This was very tasty and better than the others I've had before. Lots of flavor in the shrimp!    Cha Siu Bao. These were tasty, but very small compared to all the others I've had before. Still one of my favorites!   Egg Custard Buns...So good!  Again, very small portions, but they pack tons of flavor inside! This version was a little more \"runny\" inside than most.   And remember to finish off with the Sweet Tofu! It is a tasty rendition here :)  Got a new favorite in town!  Pics :",

We had to constantly as for water refills, no one asked how we were enjoying our meal and they kept clearing the dishes when we clearly werent done yet. We had to tell them no, we are still eating. The servers catered very well to chinese families but ignored others. Had to flag down any server standing around for our check.

This IS a Chinese restaurant and there were a ton of Chinese people and the food was incredibly delicious. I love delicious food. And I love awesome people. And on the day that I visited here, I was surrounded by both.  This is one of those little gems that you'd want to bring family from outta town to. Unfortunately, I do not know what to expect for pricing. It was a birthday brunch and two people surprised everyone and paid for the bill. That was nice, but there were a ton of people. I'm certain all 16 people left satisfied. I know I left satisfied. That's what HE said. Ha!",

Everything also lacked any real flavor. The salty duck egg buns were pretty good, as the top part are similar to the pineapple buns you get at chinese bakeries (killing two birds with one stone). For a quick and simple breakfast around Rio, this place isn't too bad.",

    "text": "1. They charged us $1 per cup of tea for each person in our group even though only 1 person actually drank the tea (the remaining 5 cups were upside down on turntable).  The rest ordered sodas or water, so in addition to a $6 tea bill, we also had a $6 soda bill. 2. Their menu was not available because they were changing things, so when we ordered chicken fried rice off the menu, we had no idea how much it cost, and we were shocked to see our bill for $13.95 for a small plate of it.   3. There were no prices on the dim sum either. Not even dishes marked A, B, C, D and no price points on any paper indicating what dishes A, B, C, D might cost so we were ordering blind.  When we asked, the dim sum cart ladies did not speak any English. 4. The dim sum cart ladies were scamming us by stamping our paper for more than they placed on our table.  I had to watch that stamping process very carefully and question everything (with hand gestures) and for some reason, we ended up being charged for 5 A dishes, 9 B dishes, and 4 C dishes, which is odd because the same items I order at other dim sum restaurants seem to be A dishes with an occasional B or C dish - again I felt scammed. 5. The bill for 4 adults, two children for lunch was $89 plus tip.  Typically when we eat dim sum at other restaurants with our Chinese friends, we have 5 adults and two children and our bill averages only $50-60, which is why we love dim sum so much.  There is usually so much value for the price. 6. Some of the food was good, but some of the hot food was cold.  Not impressed with anything.  We will never eat at KJ Dim Sum again.  There are just too many other great and trustworthy dim sum restaurants to eat at and those restaurants offer English menus with prices in plain sight so customers know how much they are paying and are not shocked by the bill.",

We then tried to order potstickers - nope, completely out of all appetizers.  Then we order our food. Each dish comes out 10-15 minutes apart, which is fine... except for the rice which by the time we got it I was full.  The last dish we ordered never even arrived.  We asked 3 times for soy sauce and never received it. And the soup needed it.  Finally, when we asked to see the manager he argued with us, saying the dishes coming out at different times is a Chinese custom. Okay... Really you're going to argue though?  We declined the final steak dish as we were done eating by this point and they made a huge show of \"we'll pay for the steak for you.\" Maybe if you had brought it out ever we would have wanted it.  All in all, it was a very uncomfortable experience and I couldn't wait to get out of there.",

We asked our server for some tea, hot sauce, hot mustard, soy sauce, and ice water...but he left halfway through our order and we were yelling at him as he was walking away from us.  He didn't even turn around to acknowledge us as he was waking away!!!  I've been to my share of dim sum restaurants around the world, from Hong Kong, NYC, SF, and LA, so I get that good service isn't considered to be important to most operators...especially to non-Chinese customers.  However, being in the Rio Casino, I would think that KJ would make more of an effort to elevate their level of service.  At the least, I would think that the Rio would demand a minimum level of service standards to uphold their rating as a top level hotel.    KJ fails in the level of service, but there aren't many dimsum restaurants in town to compete with so they probably get away with it.  It's disappointing but hopefully somebody else decides to open up a dimsum spot that provides the same level of food but focuses on a higher caliber of service than that found at KJ.",

We constantly had waiter checking our table even when they pretty much had full house of customers. price is very friendly too (small dish:$2.28 / med dish:$3.18/ large dish:$3.98 / special dish:$4.98) I definitely recommend their dim sum time!!",

The dim sum here is very fresh and they offer a wide variety.  My only complaint is that the service is kind of bad, but it's what you expect in a typical chinese restaurant.  Prices were very reasonable and you can get twice the amount of food here for the same money that you would pay at a strip dim sum restaurant.",

One dish has little food on it. i started to eat at this kj restaurant at 10:30, and i f**king only ate got 4 plate in 2 and half hours!!!!!!!! finally, i asked the server if they can order my food for me, they say, go check the food cart, but where is the f**king food cart.!!! i finally take the to go, because i cant sit at there any more.",

I am not even going to tell you what I had by name because I honestly don't know and don't want to insult those who do.  I can tell you that everything was very good.  There were so many little dumplings each with their own uniqueness.  I tried one with mushrooms, one with pork, one with soup.  There were buns with BBQ pork.  Some sort of muffin filled with custard.  Beef and/or shrimp wrapped in noodle sheets and topped with soy.  It was all so overwhelming and delicious.

Food: Sure it's not as good as Cali, but they don't take shortcuts here. The food that comes out of the kitchen taste and looks like what its suppose to be. The texture of the food tastes like what's it is suppose to. Most of the dim.sim is hot like It's suppose to when it is served to your table. I cannot vouch for the plate dishes as I've only had the dim sum.   Atmosphere: It's clean, spacious, nice air conditioning, great service, and there's four LCDs for you to watch while you eat. They have TVB Mwhahaha  Come back? Yes, and I would recommend this place over places like Orchid, East Ocean, and even Ping pang pong. I would still recommend Chang's if you are on a budget, but you get what you paid for and your experience won't be as great.",

    "text": "when having dim sum, you've got to have the proper service to go with it in order to enjoy it.  If the right variety of carts don't come around to your table it can totally affect your dim sum dining experience.  I usually don't write reviews based on the service but during a dim sum experience its all about the service.  It was also hard for us to enjoy the dim sum especially since we had to wait so long for the soy sauce/chili oil to get delivered.  The dim sum was not bad but they lost a star and 1/2 due to the lack of service.  The only plus is the location at the Rio, which is one of my favorite hotel/casinos. =)",

However, we end up in KJ Dim Sum for the dinner because of a long line waiting for tables in the Seafood Buffet.  The food was not good as I expected. After handing them my credit card, we have to sit there more than 20 mins waiting to get back my credit card. I don't know what the hell they were doing with my credit card.  3 days after that (which is today), I saw KJ Dim Sum charged me twice. WTF? I had to spend 30 mins calling my credit card customer service to dispute this transaction. And it will take time to resolve this.   WILL NEVER GO TO KJ DIM SUM AGAIN.",

I came for lunch on a wednesday, the wait wasnt too bad only 10 mins, kinda confusing though coz u dont know whether u are supposed to stay in line or get a number from the host.  Talking about the foods, we only had dimsum. There were like 5 carts, not enough for the size of the restaurant in my opinion. Their routes wasn't well distributed. Some carts have never gotten to us, and we had some passing by for at least 10 times. The foods wasnt hot and  I like my food hot. The flavor is alright. The skin of har gow and sui mai was too thick and powdery.  The price was 1.99 for a small, 2.99 for a medium, 3.99 for a large and 6.99 for special item.  Their pastry was so yummy, so delicious. Try the egg custards, durian balls and salted egg buns. The salted egg buns was my favorite, so tasty.  The service was alright. They are newly opened so its understandable. I hope it will get better.",

    "text": "Had a free room at the Rio, so we used it (not why 4 stars). 49ers broke my heart that night.  49ers lost. To themselves. They would've won the superbowl.  UGH.  So we went down to KJ. The line for Carnival was horrendous.   We got seated immediately.  It was just my fiance, our three year old, and I. So we got some chow fun, some dim sum, and..... duck feet. I actually just changed this to five stars thinking about the duck feet.  The chow fun was great, exactly how you'd expect it. The dim sum (I grew up in Hong Kong) was great, exactly how you'd expect it (if you know what to expect). The duck feet. Oh. My. God. The duck feet is why I'm going back, it's an appetizer so not tooo pricey but they perfected the flavor.   I didn't win (I only play poker-against people, not casino) at the Rio on my free stay,the 49ers lost because of themselves, but I consider the trip a God Send because of KJ.   And yes, we had breakfast, and dinner at Carnival, which was really good. I dream of the next time we goto KJ and try the Sea Cucumber.  If you haven't been to KJ, in my opinion. Try. This. Place. Don't settle for the Dim Sum. Try. This. Place. Order at least one dish from their MENU, not the dim sum menu. Their menu.... (So, my advice is TRY MORE than dim sum. Hell, they advertise themselves as a seafood restaurant!!)  The ambiance was great. It's so awesome to actually have Chinese servers in a Chinese restaurant that all speak English you speak respect, or humanity? Towards them first... I was slightly intoxicated and stumbled upon open kitchen doors, and are you kidding me? There were Chinese cooks!  There is a really great picture of recent Hong Kong Island on one of the walls, my son loved that as we have smaller versions in our house.  Food was 5 star service 4, in our three person experience. Maybe because I'm a white guy that speaks Cantonese?   I'll be going back. Soon.",

    "text": "NO STARS ACTUALLY!!!    DO NOT COME HERE FOR DIM SUM!!!!  I REPEAT...DO NOT!    My family and I frequent this place regularly for dim sum.  But yesterday was the last and dual final time I will be coming here.    1st - they now charge $1 per person for tea, which normally I wouldn't mind, I understand tea gets expensive and can add up.  But the jasmine tea tasted like hot water with a hint of color to it, no Jasmine taste what so ever.   Service is slow and servers all looked unhappy. I'm Chinese, and trust me I'm used to Asian restaurants with bad or no service, it just comes with dining at an Asian restaurant. Especially Chinese.  But this has got to be the worst I've had in a long time.   Sat down, was asked what kind of tea would you like. Not aware $1 per person. I ordered the stream rice rolls with cilantro n green onion with the server.  15 minutes went by, not a single food cart. Entire restaurant 4 carts, steam cart, congee cart, miscellaneous food,  and Chinese broccoli cart.  The ladies were pushing them like the wheels were broken or something!  Finally the stream cart came by. We ordered 8 dishes my Mom, boyfriend, n myself) figured we load up since it took so long.  The same cart with the same food came by 3 times after that, no new items.  I asked for steamed tripe, and shrimp rice rolls and she looked around at the other carts and said \"I don't have it.\"    I finally get my order of cilantro and green onion rice roll, only to see a plan ol' plate of steam rolls, no herb. I told the lady I wanted cilantro n green onion. She walked up to the waitress that I placed my order with and told her next time not to write the word white in the order, white means plan. The waitress then comes over to the table and says, \"the lady just started working a few days ago so she made the mistake. We have to make your another one.\"  In the meantime, no other carts came by but the 4 carts that had nothing that sparked my interest. Asked for egg custard tarts, nothing. Not a single one to be found. As time pasted, I got more and more frustrated as I watched the lady bring out cilantro green onion rice rolls to all the other tables that were seated AFTER us!  The table next to us had 5 orders of egg tarts delivered to their table.  So I decided to place one order and ask for the check...we were fed up at this point.   The waitress took the check to tally up and added the order of egg custard to the bill.  She came back and said 15 minutes wait for the egg tarts.  So damn frustrated I said NO!  I can't wait anymore, I have to leave now (by now it's 90 minutes).  She walked away, went up to the cashier, came back n said ok 6 minutes ok because she already added the tarts on your bill.  I finally said fine and agreed.  15 minutes later...no tart in sight and the waitress kept dodging our table because she knew I was trying to get her attention.  Finally got her attention and she went to get them. I felt played for a fool.    $50 later and we were all still some what hungry. Because of this almost 2 hour lunch, I was almost late to work.    NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!",

We went on a Sunday afternoon and a few tables were occupied at the time. We basically had 4 carts chase us to our table as soon as we were seated which was great.

We were looking for a place for dimsum and the Chinese dealer at Bally's recommanded KJ.  We were there around noon on Monday and waited for about 10 minutes for a table.  There were a dozen people before us and the wait wasn't too bad.  Once inside and seated a waitor came and asked what type of teas would we like and we order the usual iron buddha tea.  The seating is confortable.  Tables ae well spread out.  Did not feel crowded although the place is pack.  The dimsum was suprisingly good.  I think better than Ping Pang Pong at Gold Coast.  The food tastes freshly made and flavorful.    Once thing I noticed that set this place apart from many others is that the waiters come to check on the tea pot quite often which is a good thing because usually you have to call them to refill the pot.  Didn't have to at all at this restaurant.  Service was fast and courtesy.  Did not go there for dinner so can't say if the experience would be the same.  Next time in Vegas, definetely will go there for dimsum.",

I learned from a friend that some chinese restaurants are sketchy with dirty dining, so she recommended me this place because they are under a hotel and casino establishment which means they have to have qualities set high if they want to keep open under a big name industry.

Other tables consisted of Chinese speakers who didn't wait for the carts to come around (the carts really weren't moving) and we're ordering from whoever they could stop. If you can flag down a waiter and lost all of the items you want, then your table will have food. If you want carts to visit your table, then you will be waiting a long time.   The food was bland! I got fried taro, bean curd, a shrimp roll, and shu Mai and it was all bland. I was looking forward to ordering triple as much food but after getting to taste the few items they had, I decided not to.   Even for Chinese standards, this place is bad. Don't go.

    "text": "Maybe I'm a dim sum snob because I'm from the Bay Area and am fortunate to have eaten great dim sum. Other than in the Midwest, this may be some of the worst dim sum I've eaten. When frozen dumplings from Trader Joe's or the Asian supermarket taste better, you have a problem. Unless you really have a hankering for dim sum and can't get it anywhere else where you live, I would recommend eating something else.  This is located inside the Rio, across the from the buffet. We didn't have a problem getting a table for 7 when we arrived around 11 am but there was a wait when we left around noon.  The service for the carts was extremely slow - I don't know if that's normal, or if was a function of where we were sitting.  Best Dishes:  Har Gow - Shrimp Dumpling - This actually tasted normal, and 4 pieces per order. The size of each dumpling was smaller than you usually get elsewhere.  Crab & Shrimp Dumpling - This was one of my favorites from what we ordered.  Mediocre / Nothing to Write Home About: Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Steamed BBQ Pork Buns, Chinese Broccoli, Shrimp in Rice Noodle (the rice noodle portion was a bit on the thick side and the shrimp was a little sparse)  Pass: Fried Calamari - this tasted like it had been deep fried yesterday and nuked in the microwave. Not fresh at all. Veggie Dumplings - These actually have shrimp in there, but the veggies and shrimp didn't taste very fresh.  The one saving grace was that it was inexpensive - our bill pre-tip was $65 for 7 people, but you also get what you pay for. The food was edible, but I wouldn't crave this or make a special trip to go here. There are far better places to eat in Vegas.",

Clams with ginger-scallion sauce are good quality, but the sauce is a too oily and unappealingly thick and not usable as a sauce you would actually eat on your rice. If you must, get the black bean sauce and request 'low oil'. You'll probably get 'high saliva' ha ha ;) House Lo Mein comes out kind of oily as well. Again, ask for 'low oil' if you gotta get it.  Management is a bit odd, a holdover trait from the original Spring Mountain Road location where you get a completely different menu w/no specials (and a fork) if you don't speak Chinese.  Dim Sum here is pretty average - it may even make you realize that you don't actually like Dim Sum. Kind of like jazz. We're told that it's good and that we should appreciate it, but the nuts of it are that it kind of sucks. Eating lukewarm food that was cooked 5 hours ago off of a rolling cart is just dumb.  If you're hankering for Chinese and are staying in the Rio, you're probably better off hitting the Rio Buffet and at least getting some crab legs out of the deal.   Free tea is cool. Good on them.

The restaurant was packed to the brim with people at the tables and a large crowd waiting inside and out. We had two tables split between us all. We ordered Chrysanthemum tea and iced waters. They came to the table with red solo cups  which I found a little hilarious. But they only had the same three carts rotating for the entire time we were there. The food was mediocre at best. Towards the end we special ordered shrimp rolls (ha churng) because they didn't have any in the carts. So we're waiting for them to arrive. As soon as an order arrives to our table, a guest, from the table across from us, erupted and started screaming at us for getting the order first. He is cussing up a storm and yelling at us. I was so taken aback from his behavior. My family starts to react to his behavior, yelling back at him for being LITERALLY HANGRY! It was so ridiculous. The staff came to restraint and calm the man. It was so embarrassing to watch this guy. But a moment later, he finally got his dish. Smh. Everything after that was ruined. But the food was just not up to par and lacked flavor.",

    "text": "Located inside a bright and cheerful dining room in the Rio, and offering much better quality than other dim sum spots in Vegas, I'm a fan of KJ! They will make items for you if you ask, and serve dim sum all day and late into the night. Five of us threw down a pretty eclectic variety of breakfast, my favorite items:  Congee: comforting with Century egg.  Salt and Pepper Squid: perfectly executed. Walnut Shrimp: deliciously decadent!  Shrimp Balls: bite sized balls of goodness :)  Egg Custard: my favorite in Las Vegas.  Red Bean Bun: savory, fluffy bun. Shiu Mau: appreciate the roe.  Chive Balls: not at all greasy.  Sweet Tofu: flavorful without being cloying.  Taro Bun: so very good, real taro flavor.  Chinese Broccoli with Garlic: superfreshTM Sesame Balls: sweet, nutty, tasty balls!  XLB: everyone loved them: I don't eat pork, but they were soupy for sure!   Service is pretty good, they are very busy during weekend prime-time. New items are added to the menu occasionally, and there's more hits than misses, IMO. 3.5* rounded up.  * bright, cheerful & bustling room inside Rio*  ** wide array of dim sum options, served all day (open late- till 2AM DAILY) **   *** will make items for you if asked ***   **** new offerings added to keep it fresh ****",

    "text": "This is my new favorite dim sum place in Las Vegas. First experience, went with my parents. The wait for a table was maybe 10 minutes as I went during prime time for lunch (around 12pm). After I was seated at my table, I ordered the usual things you'd usually get when you go dim sum. Siu Mai, Steamed chicken feet , and sticky rice wrapped w/ lotus leaves. Very fresh, flavored well, and steaming hot ! When even I say hot, its HOT.   The chicken feet were flavored well. Not over seasoned, though tendons still a little chewy (could have used a few more minutes in the steamer) but still pretty well done.   The pork siu mai was topped with some masago (capelin roe). Steaming hot. Flavor was good. The pork was \"chewy\", not in a bad sense but it has a slight resistance that shows it was made properly. There is a fairly decent size shrimp piece in there as well, that was not over cooked.   The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves was nice. Wrapped normally with a few lotus leaves. Did not fall apart as i was taking the leaves off. Flavored well, good amount of ingredients inside the sticky rice.   After a few other items were ordered, ranging from a few different buns, shrimp rice noodle, pan fried chives dumpling, and egg tarts.   There were two types of buns i had ordered. One was called (directly translated) leaking sand bun which was made with i believe a salted egg yolk mixture which when you pull apart the bun, the rich, egg yolk mixture oozes out. perfectly made. that's the result you'd look for when you get this bun. hot from the oven, before the bun itself soaks up this yolk mixture. very delicious.   the other bun (directly translated) is called the snow mountain bun. Has a white crust on top with i believe a lotus filling. Very good. Nice and hot off the cart.   The shrimp rice noodle was well-made also. Good thickness to the noodle and a good sized shrimp lined in the middle of the noodle, topped with a soy sauce that was prepared to be slightly sweet.   The pan fried chives dumping is one of my favorite items to get. Parts of the outer skin layer crispy due to the pan fried technique while the size is still nice and soft. The filling had ample amounts of Chinese chives, shrimp, and pork. Seasoned really well, not overpowering the natural tastes of the chives or meats.   Last but not least, is the egg tarts.. Fresh out of the oven, nice flaky golden crust with a glimmering, shiny egg filling in the middle. The crust was warm and flaky but still unable to taste the butter? they use to create the flaky crust mixed with a bite of the the slightly sweet egg center. One of the many favorite dim sum items or snack items among the chinese communities.   Unfortunately this was my first meal, so I didnt get to order much before I was stuffed. I will not hesitate to come back again for another round of dim sum.   A little suggestion, try going with 4-6 people in your party if you want to try a good amount of the dishes they offer during lunch. Lunch is served between 10 AM and 3 PM. Don't hesitate to go early or late ! They will specially prepare the item of your choice even if you don't see it available on the cart.   The prices are very reasonable, especially considering this restaurants sits inside the Rio Casino & Resort. The prices are as followed:  Small: $2.28 Medium: $3.18 Large: $3.98 Special: $4.98  *edit*  I went again recently. One thing to note was the service was quite lacking. Forgotten orders or took a while to serve us.",

    "text": "So I usually am one who likes to prove other reviews wrong, but unfortunately I have to agree with my fellow yelpers.  I had roast duck and expected quite more for a casino restaurant.  My duck was soaked with water and wasn't cooked thorough enough for the meat to fall off the bone.  Sorry, but duck isn't that hard to cook.  My second opinion is that of the staff.  They speak very broken English and it was very hard to communicate about what was on the menu.  I had to make an uninformed decision on what to order, because nobody could understand me.  I also felt rushed to order.  My iced tea tasted stale and was never offered refills.  I came here with another couple and we felt somewhat ignored.  My final complaint was that when the entrees did come, they came separate which is rude for guests who are trying to enjoy each other's company.  Fortunately, I will not be coming back.",

    "text": "KJ's was the surprise of our trip to Vegas.  We were feeling unmotivated to leave our hotel (as unremarkable as all the other food we've had there was) so we headed down to what we thought would be a safe choice - the buffet.  You can understand our reluctance to leave the relative comfort of a standard breakfast/lunch buffet to try a Chinese restaurant buzzing across the way from us.  Hubby dug up a nugget from his memory bank and suddenly remembered that a coworker of his had mentioned this place and said it wasn't bad.  I guess \"it wasn't bad\" was good enough for us to defect from the buffet line.  And honestly...it wasn't bad.  It's exactly the same as all the other dim sum places we've had in Orange County:  - Hit or miss dishes (some dishes were overcooked so the skin on the dumplings were way too soggy) - No service for the meek.  Speak up (raise your hand) or you'll sit there without hot sauce, soy sauce or iced water the entire time - Semi-aggressive sales ladies trying to get rid of their wares  No one dish really stood out except maybe the stir fried rice noodles which didn't come with much except scallions and onions (no meat) and cost $6.95.  We happily packed up the leftovers and had it in front of the TV later.  Just be prepared to see people jump the line.  The hostesses seat their friends first (no number required).",

We ordered the siomai, which was good. The folks who pushed the carts around did not speak English very well, so I couldn't ask them what dishes they were pushing along. We asked for the regular menu, and I ordered the sweet and sour shrimp, while my wife ordered the chicken chow main. Both dishes were pretty large and absolutely delicious! Our server was super friendly and very attentive. They have TVs showing Asian programming and some sports. We spent 90 bucks there after the tip. It was a different dining experience, and I would definitely go back next time I'm at the Rio. I give it an A for service, an A for the food, a B for the atmosphere since it feels like a  food hall, and a B for the price. It's not priced like your local neighborhood Chinese restaurant, but that ended up being a good thing.",

I looked over all the options, and this looked like a big menu and a classy atmosphere.  It's unfortunate their menu isn't online, but luckily other Yelpers took pics of the menu. It was a little confusing, like under \"scallops\" they have sauteed scallops and under \"sizzling\" they had sizzling scallops, so it's hard to tell with no descriptions what the differences are.  I had the shrimp and vegetables and my boyfriend at the scallops and vegetables, which were both fresh and filling even though it doesn't look like a ton of food. The dishes ranged from $17-$20. It cost a couple dollars extra to get rice. The service was okay. At the end we waited a while then flagged down another waiter to ask them to let our waitress know we needed the check (we had a show to get to).  I was on fence between 3 and 4. It seems like a decent option for restaurants in this hotel, but if I compared it to non-Vegas restaurants, the food didn't blow me away. It was serviceable.",

The staff was loud and busy, but the service was fast. Don't know if I've eaten so many of my favorite things to fast before! Happy belly!   The hot lava buns are an absolute must!",

Definitely have had better Chinese food, else where.  The service was pretty terrible. The waiter did not really look at us while talking. The waiter who dropped our food off, literally deposited the food on the table and walked off without a word. It was not like the restaurant was busy, so there was no reason for the abruptness. The vibe was that the waiters had something better to be doing. I wouldn't really recommend this place.",

Back in the day I'd have a comp and always thought the food tasted much better when it was free or at least prepaid if you know what I'm saying... it is in the city of lost wages!   Back in the day this place would be alway packed especially on a going home Sunday.  This time around my group of 10 were seated and served quickly.  The dim sum carts came by and we were eating almost immediately.  We were seated in a section with a TV which was great since we all had placed our sports bets and were anxious to see if we were going to enjoy a free or expensive meal. Lol   The selection was endless and the freshness was obvious. From the xlbs to the Chinese Broccoli and even the chicken feet, everything was on point.  I noticed the steam coming off of each entree as the staff pushed along all the tasty options.  Eventually we had about 20 different items and the table started to look like an advertisement for the place with so much color.  With help of the lazy Susan my group came hungry and left happy without breaking the bank.  Let's just say my executive decision to have brunch here instead of at the buffet or even at hash house was the best decision of the weekend.  We were ready to head home after an epic bachelor party weekend.  I know I'll be back for sure when I visit again.  Thanks KJ see you soon.",

If I want something that's fast with no fuss this is the place to go for me.   Kj's space is huge with lots of tables. They serve dim sum in carts. I really like their rice noodle rolls, the spare ribs and the congee. Their dumplings are flavorful and fresh as well too.   If you order seafood here, like items with shrimp, it doesn't taste the freshest  the meat is a little rubbery because it's most likely frozen before.  It's not bad at all but it's also not the best.   Prices here are reasonable and service is really fast. I will say that they don't have that much variety.  There were about 4 to 5 carts in the restaurant but items are a little redundant.",

We got seated and waited about 15 minutes for someone to come ask us what we wanted for drinks so we tried to order food at the same time and the server just walks away. We ordered 4 dim sum plates, roasted duck, and beef chow fun.   The dim sum plates came out first. The ribs undercooked with the meat pink, shrimp was also undercooked. As for the beef chow fun, they half assed cooked it, from what it looked like they cooked the noodles separately and the beef, vegetable and sauce just getting dumped over. Sorry I'm not stupid, I eat it enough at other places to know that the noodles aren't white if it has been mixed with the sauce. Roast duck was super dry. HORRIBLE SERVICE and FOOD preparation. I couldn't even get a refill on water either. No racial but my gf and I were maybe a few of the couple asians(like 7) in there with the majority being white. When it came time to asking for the check it was like waiting in line at the dmv. C'mon now half the restaurant was empty and these fools can't even get me a bill? We really thought about just getting up and leaving. This place must treat people like this all the time cause they probably know tourist will stop by once but sorry I'm a LOCAL and not going back.

Service: We waited for some time until someone came up from the restaurant to assign us a table. The dinning area wasn't full at that time, so obviously they were  understaffed. It was also very hard to get waiters' attention *any time*. I asked for something not on the menu to get a vegetable dish and also asked how much it would that be. The waiter told me it would be $10ish. Then he suggested Treasure Island Pea Sprout. I assumed it would have a similar price and didn't ask further. However, we found that this dish costed $10 more expensive. They also forgot our dimsum order, which was also printed on the bill. Given that this restaurant didn't even have a line waiting at the door, this mistake is not acceptable.   Food: Their food was on the salty side, such as seafood eggplant in a claypot, Cantonese style beef. They taste good with rice, though. The green bean dish we got was half raw. Chow fun and Yang-chow fried rice was good. However, they are not even par to average in the line of Chinese food IMO. It could be that I am spoiled by SF  Chinese food. There's no free dessert, but there are fortune cookies when checkout.   Price: This place is overpriced given the food quality and service.   If you are craving for Asian food, I would recommend dropping by the Asian food court around Chinatown mall on Spring Mountain Rd. Food/price is much better/more reasonable there.",

    "text": "Found this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try since it's at Rio.  It's a nice large authentic Chinese restaurant.  Good service.  It's not just a tourist restaurant targeting the casino visitors. Locals go there, too.  It was packed during lunch hours for Dim Sum.  We waited for almost an hour for a table.  Dim Sum was authentic and good.  Price was reasonable.  The egg tarts were the best, very flaky shells with many layers.  They don't make them often so they are not in the carts that going around. We had to order them.  Dim Sum was 5 star.  We also had dinner here.  It was less busy at dinner time.  There is no wait for a table.  The waiter took our orders of 2 dishes quickly.  He was like rushing us to order.  Then we waited for a long time, more than half an hour for our food to come.  This is very slow for Chinese restaurant.  The food good, not great, and not special either.  Dinner was 3 star.",

I found the offerings bland and uninspired as well as very expensive for dim sum. When I asked for Saracha sauce - a staple item in dim sum restaurants, they told me they didn't have any. I asked for whatever hot sauce they had - they had none. The food - stir fried rice noodle and cabbage - flavorless. Pressed and fried shrimp and pork dumplings - flavorless. Chinese Broccoli - cooked perfectly. Bill for these three items - $23 - all cart items. I'm not new to dim sum - have it once a month for years. This was the worst excuse I've experienced. I should note that the service was excellent and friendly. This is a management issue.",

One of the dish, steamed fish, was recommended by the waiter. We asked about the price and the waiter told us it would be $38, about 2 lbs. So, we said ok. The fish dish took a long time and we were joking that they must have gone fishing. When it finally came, we were mostly full. Then came the bill, and there was a $104 dish! We were really surprised and asked what it was. It was the fish! It was supposed to be $38/lb, and the fish weighed 2.7 lb! The fact was none of us heard that it was $38 per pound. The bill was presented to us by someone we had not seen, and the waiter was nowhere to be seen. When we questioned the bill, another person came up and said something like \"of course it was $38 per pound...\" No apology even for confusion or anything like that sort. We paid the bill, feeling cheated. Now coming to think of it, the fish could not have weighted 2.7 lbs. I often steam fish myself and a 2 lb fish is already pretty big, and our fish that day was at most 2lbs. I would give it no star if possible.",

Once my uncle asked about a dish he didn't know the waiter just simply said it was good.   The worst part was that I didn't get to eat some dim sum because they said they didn't serve them past midnight which is absurd since this restaurant has the word Dim Sum in their name.

I have been coming here shortly after they opened, so it has been a couple years now. Time to write them a review.   Food- everything I have tried was fresh and yummy. I personally love leek and taro, so I really enjoy their leek items here. I have the following list that I order every time I go.  1.Teochew Dumplings ()-- I enjoy their Teochew dumplings every time I go. This is a dumplings with clear noodle wrap and filled with leek, water chestnut and pork.   2.Pan fried Leek Dumplings()--love their pan fried leek dumplings as well. It's perfectly made with enough leek and meat to make it juicy not dry. 3. Shrimp in rice noodle wrap ()-- this dish tastes the same at most dim sum places you go but their shrimp is a decent size. This item is on a must list whenever I go to dim sum as well. 4. Fried Taro pastries -- the crunchiness of the outside and the moist/ soft taro inside, yummy!!!! This dish is not a dessert, the taro inside is seasoned with salt and other stuff.  5.Shumei -- their shumei is decent. I would say it's better than most places in Vegas but somehow I still love shumei from Jasmine inside of Bellagio the best.  6.Shrimp dumplings/ Haogow-- it's also a must ordered dish when I go to dim sum. It's not too bad here also.  7. Sticky rice wrapped in leaf -- I love sticky rice and this dish here is decent as well. Definitely give it a try. 8.Pineapple Buns -- I order this item from time to time. They have green tea flavor now which is different and interesting. 9. Tofu Dessert soup -- I love tofu and they are very generous with the portion. Silky tofu in ginger and sugar soup. Yummy. 10. Last not least. The famous Egg Tarts -- I love love love their egg tarts here. Majority of time when I ordered, it's hot and fresh like they just came out of oven. I have not tried egg tarts from golden gate bakery but this is one of the best that I tried before. Although I do wish they have Portuguese egg tarts here!   Services-- they are usually busy so they are not as attentive as I would like them to be but they are usually very friendly even though you don't speak Cantonese. Unlike some other places in town, if you don't speak Cantonese In a Cantonese restaurants, you get some kind of attitude :/.   Environment -- the place is big and clean. Also its got many TVs in here.   All in all, I love this place. When I visited Koi Palace in SF (the famous dim sum place), I was not happy with an hour wait, the attitude was bad and the food was just okay. KJ dim sum you rock!",

Chinese Broccoli with oyster sauce? Surprisingly good! Tofu pudding? Texturally disappointing...not smooth at all!   for 5 people we spent about $100. Yeah, we ordered beef chow fun and chicken wings but wow...$100 for dim sum?!?! I guess I should have expected as much seeing that this is a casino.

Such was the case Saturday with Li Ly, our friend who is moving back to San Francisco and the reason 7 of us got together for brunch.  We had shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, sesame balls, sweet buns, and some good shrimp balls.  I don't know the Chinese names for any of these, but they were generally good.

    "text": "Dim sum palace close to the strip in a casino!  Very authentic, I heard that the casino hospitality president wanted to do a Chinese restaurant right so he got HK restauranteur Danny Leung Nhan and gave him considerable liberty and funding to repeat his successful formula.  That entailed stealing some talented Chinatown chefs to bring that authenticity which they aren't able to have otherwise.  So did it payoff?   The Good: Shrimp hargow: Check pork ribs: Check (Yum!) Sticky rice in lotus leaves: Check  Rice noodle in shrimp: Check Fried tarot root cake: Check (Yum!) Egg custard tarts: Check (Yum!) Mistranslated menu: Check  The Bad: The price (?): a little more than SGV or chinatown (though not much) but you should expect that Service: Really nice for the most part, except the hostess asked if I wanted a lunch menu and never came back with one though she did apologize after remembering 20 min later.  Also, they added jasmine tea to my bill then removed it after I told them I didn't order or receive any tea  Overall a really impressive experience for a large Casino Chinese place, though I don't really mind driving to Chinatown and I hardly go or stay at the Rio so it's not that more convenient.  It was nice to see a place \"get it\" though to cater to their Chinese gambling clientele, and looking at the menu I'd come back again to try their seafood dinner.",

When you walk in its totally like an asian feel. There are many tables and the space is huge!! Great for large parties! They do have a better variety of dim sum and siomai than Orchid Gardens. But I honestly like Orchid Garden better, and the food really tasted the same. We ordered the pork and shrimp siomai, shrimp chow mein, egg flour soup, chinese broccoli, shrimp dumpling. Everything was fresh don't get me wrong and it was really good, but i just rather prefer Orchid Garden. In my opinion.  Menu was really pricey, if you were to order soup it was like $20. but i guess that's what you pay for when you're on the strip. If you're visiting and you're near the Rio then yes try out this place. But if you're a local don't waste your money and time driving here.",

First off the Dim Sum is only served until 2pm. They think this is \"authentic\", but that desire for authenticity doesn't carry over to the food. The rest of the dishes are just bad. I defy you to find any lobster in their \"lobster egg rolls\". They're basically big spring rolls.   Trust me, go elsewhere for Chinese. The prices here aren't even good, so you can get far better other places nearby. I'd suggest Red 8 at the Wynn. Much, much nicer and way better food, at the same prices. Trust me, you deserve better than this place.",

    "text": "The wife and I love dim sum.  We decided to try KJ Dim Sum & Seafood for lunch given its location at the Rio, where we were staying because the wife was there for a conference, and the fact that we'd both never been there before.  We arrived around 11AM on a Sunday.  The spacious dining wasn't close to capacity, but filled up steadily while we were there, seemingly with multi-generational, local families far more than out of town guests staying at the Rio.  KJ Dim Sum operated like most every other dim sum restaurant with multiple carts loaded with various dumplings and other small plate specialties making the circuit around the dining room.  The food was hot and delicious.  In truth, I thought all of their offerings tasted equal to or better than our usual go-to dim sum place, Ping Pang Pong's.  What truly set KJ Dim Sum apart from every dim sum restaurant than I've ever been to in the country was the service.  Our server always kept our water glasses and pot of hot tea filled without us ever having to ask.  Sure, it may be a little thing, but having been to more than few dim sum restaurants, the service was noticed and very much welcomed by me.   KJ Dim Dum & Seafood impressed us so much, we returned for a mid-week lunch with one of her fellow conference attendees.  Our experience was probably even better the second time around since parties of three seem to be the most optimal size for dim sum allowing us to sample more while likely consuming and paying less than we did when we were only a party of two.  Service was also like our previous visit...on point.  In the end, I was really glad that we gave KJ Dim Sum a try.  It has moved to the top of my list of favorite dim sum restaurants in town.",

Once, there was a private event and another time, they were closed.   This time, we planned to go at Opening time (10am) on a Monday. The spacious, clean restaurant was about half empty at 10:30am.  The carts came quickly, our tummies were happily satisfied, and the service was efficient and relatively pleasant!  Our teapot and water glasses were filled without our asking.  Parking was a bit tricky, but free. Go to the side of the casino across from Gold Coast Casino on Valley View Drive.  We parked in the lot closest to the door...we could see the sign for the restaurant!  My mom, sister, cousin, and roommate all enjoyed the food...especially the custard tarts (don tot)...freshly out of the oven, they were warm and delicious! I didn't care for the XLB - they were almost room temperature and on the bland side. However, my cousin really liked the chicken feet - they were on the spicy side to me. He also liked the cha siu bao because the bread was fluffy. I didn't have any - I was full at that point!  I wouldn't mind returning!  It was a great experience!",

Truth be told, I don't really expect alot when it comes to customer service specifically in Chinese restaurants based off of past experiences. But I must say that the service I get here is always excellent. The waiters would take our orders within a few minutes after being seated and the food would always come out hot and fresh. Not once have I experienced eating reheated stale tasting food here. Our glasses were constantly being checked to make sure they were filled and if we wanted any more hot water refills for our teapots. Waitresses here are very patient and if there is something you are unsure of on the menu they will gladly answer your questions. Their english may not be as perfect as some would expect but they do understand & can speak it. Thank you KJ. We will be back.",

    "text": "KJ Dim Sum & Seafood is located in the Rio All Suites Hotel & Casino. On my latest visit to Vegas, I stayed at the Rio so it was convenient for me to run down for breakfast. It is definitely pricier than driving down to a dim sum spot in Chinatown, but that's the price to pay for convenience.   At first I came down around 9:30am because Dim Sum is traditionally a breakfast meal, but they were not open until 10am. The security was trying to tell me that Dim Sum is LUNCH... No sir!! It is breakfast!!   Anyways, I come back around 10:15am and there were only a few other patrons so the dim sum carts came by so quickly. I got a pot of Jasmine Tea ($1) to start. The chili and hot mustard is available upon request. The dim sum items on my receipt range between $3.68-$4.68/each) which is definitely on the pricey side.   Hargow - The skin on their hargow was really tough and a bit on the dry side. Considering these are steamed, they should be soft and moist. The shrimp on the inside was super tiny.   Shui Mai - KJ dim sum has a special version of Shui Mai where they throw a piece of scallop on top and probably upcharge me on it. I actually didn't like it any better and if anything, it was really fishy. This serving also only had 3 pieces when it is usually served with 4 pieces.   Fung Chow - I feel like the chicken feet was not flavored enough. It was decent though.  Rice Porridge - I love rice porridge with thousand year egg. This one was on the bland side with not that much thousand year egg. The lady was really nice to mix it up and scoop it from the bottom, but it looks like they just made it with minimum thousand year egg.   Soft Tofu - I wanted to be healthy so I ordered the soft tofu. It comes with a ginger syrup that they lady put on the side. That's actually nice so people can control how much they want to put it, if any. I really like ginger so I like it with a lot of ginger syrup.   Don tat - Egg Tarts!! These were still baking when I first came in so I waited for them before I cashed out. They were available around 10:45am, 45 minutes after opening. That is pretty common for these to be ready later. It was so delicious and flakey fresh out of the oven. I enjoyed one, and then togo-ed the rest to enjoy later since I was so full.   Not the best, but it was convenient. I was surprise how little English the ladies here knew since it was in the Rio. I was able to communicate to them since I knew what the dishes I liked were called, but other patrons seemed to struggle to communicate with them for their orders. I can't say I recommend this spot for pricing or quality.",

    "text": "Yeah for Dim Sum!  I ate here twice on this trip to Vegas.  The food, especially the dim sum, is good.  I only wish I knew how much I was paying before I go to the cashier as the bill is just stamped as I get food.  My favorite dishes are the mochi rice with pork, the noodle with shrimp, the shrimp shumai, black bean ribs, char sui bao, and others I can't remember the names to.  You have to be stern in turning away the food you don't want as the cart staff is pretty pushy with the food.  The hostesses are very friendly and the waitress/waiters are very quick with your requests.  The tea and water is refilled quickly and even if they are busy, the food is quick.  The prices are pretty high for Chinese food in Vegas but you can use your Caesars rewards credits to pay or get food comps for your gambling play.  So when I'm staying at the Rio again, I am  sure to visit here again as well.",

    "text": "I came here today for lunch with my parents and my boyfriend. I wanted to venture out and try a different establishment from the ones we always go to. I called and made reservations and sure enough the place was packed and people waiting.   Some of the dimsum we had were ~  SHRIMP SHIU MAI Not my favorite shiu mai, but not absolutely terrible.  STEAM BBQ PORK BUN I really like the steam buns because the buns themselves are sweet, but the bun to meat ratio is ok because sometimes in other places, only a few pieces of the pork; so you're left with a lot more of the bun.  CHINESE BROCCOLI WITH OYSTER SAUCE I always have to have a veggie dish with my meal and this was my fave I get everytime I go to a dimsum place. I like the broccoli on its own and also I add sweetness from the sauce.  CHICKEN FEET Small but soft. Texture wise, it's average.   DEEP FRIED SESAME BALL This is one of my mom's favorite dessert. I really love the crispiness and sweetness of the ball.  SPARE RIBS This is a tricky dish because the flavor was there, but it was chewy.  STEAM CHICKEN This dish was pretty simple. It was completely steamed, but it was cold.   They didn't have Jellyfish, duck, sweet tofu, noodle dish, etc.   The hostess had a microphone announcing the next table and it was loud and annoying. The service was not good as we had to keep getting their attention for more water, napkins etc. They needed more staff.  Overall, I give it 3.5 stars.",

We arrived just a little after 2pm and we were seated right away.  Granted we beat the crowd.  Nonetheless, we were welcomed with a smile, offered tea and water almost instantly.  Within a few minutes, a herd of hot steaming dim sum carts circle around us, offering us all the basic dim sum I usually get.  Our glasses of water were never half empty and our server was very attentive.  All the dim sum items were fresh and delicious.  I would not hesitate to return here again.  Thanks Auntie Nadine S. for yet another recommendation!",

    "text": "I ended up going to KJ Dim Sum & Seafood last weekend, on a Sunday mid-morning. It's located inside the Rio, west entrance. Parking is free, unlike most casinos on the strip. The restaurant is right across from the buffet inside the Rio.  When inside the restaurant, seating was quick. I came here with my boyfriends parents whom already had a table.   You are provided a punch card, like typical Dim Sum restaurants. Unfortunately our table only had three carts pass by. The food was pretty good. We had a variety of dishes such as their chow mein, another noodle dish, sweet rice, sticky rice, chasu bao, siu mai, and a few other dishes like their tofu.  Tea was cold. I don't particular care for cold tea. I'd come to this Dim Sum location again if I had a reason to be near the strip. I'm sort of located out in the NW of Vegas and it's quite a drive to get here. There are plenty of other Dim Sum locations off strip, near Spring Mountain that is comparable and less pricey than KJ Dim Sum & Seafood.   If you're located in the Rio, and don't feel like traveling out for Dim Sum, you should check this place out.",

We were seated immediately and before I had sat in my chair they were pushing dim sum in our face. We said yes to a few things we weren't sure about and quickly realIzed we had to say no a lot to get what we really wanted. We asked for pork shu mai and soup dumplings and were quickly given them. They were delicious! We ordered pot stickers as those are our favorite of ours. They do offer a full menu, but the dim sum carts are what people come for.   We had six or seven different items and the total bill? $30. We thought it was wrong. The only thing that made the price increase was the dumplings which were $7.99. Truly can't beat that! It was good but I've definitely had better. MGM has an amazing place but the price is pretty steep. Good option inside the Rio for sure.",

We just assumed another person ordered it from our table but alas... no one did. By the time we realized, it was too late lol. Savage.  Everything was a bit greasy and the kitchen doesn't open to \"cook\" until an hour after the restaurant opens...??? So strange. We had to wait to get our Chinese broccoli... which came out super greasy! It was slipping and sliding everywhere on the plate... no chopsticks could catch them lol.  The only redeeming factor would be the dessert buns. I got egg custard and tarp and I'd definitely come back for those... only those! I'd get Togo for the ride home too... just in case lol.   Everything else was standard grade Chinese dim sum. Nothing outside of the dessert was memorable",

I had checked Yelp and saw that there was Dim Sum, which he loves, so I suggested we go there for dinner.  We ended up getting there a bit late so we decided to go the next morning.  Parking at the Rio is FREE which is Awesome!  Like most Dim Sum places, there was a crowd waiting. His friends put our name down around 10:30, so when we got there at 11, our table was ready.   Dim Sum is pretty good here - we got the shrimp and beef rice noodles, Chinese broccoli, haw gao, siu mai, chasu bao, chicken feet, etc.  Some of the same carts kept coming by and we had to track down some other items, but that's pretty typical.  Dishes were yummy and the staff kept the tea filled.",

I loved that they walked past with carts, so you could actually see the food. They would explain what each plate had and what was in each dish.   I liked the shrimp (don't know how else to say this, so excuse me) balls. They were cooked well and very tasty. There were things that looked like wontons with chicken and spinach in them, that were very good. The tea was okay, but the servers were definitely on their job; constantly checking on my drinks, but not in an annoying way. Tried this rice that was in a giant leaf thing, didn't care for the flavor. Had this dessert that was made with sweetened egg, and it was delicious! I also liked that the portions were small, so you could try multiple things.   My friend said that there was some pressure from the women with the carts, so I'm not sure if they work on commission, or maybe they need to empty their carts in a certain amount of time, or what. If he were not a confident man, I'm sure this would have made for an uncomfortable vibe, but him and I laughed it off. Will definitely be coming here again.",

The decor was nice and the servers we did encounter were very nice.  Main complaint they never brought us anything to drink.  We had to search out our waiter, we would ask the servers with the carts for water and they said our waiter would be around but that didn't happen.  We saw the waiters were cleaning off another table and we got their attention and asked again for water.  Needless to say those waters were not refilled either until we tracked someone down again.  We were never offered tea until we were already halfway though our meal.  The highlight was the coconut buns for me but they were not hot and I think we would have been better off going across the walkway to the buffet which when we were there had no line.",

It's convenient and really not bad.  heck, I eat at Yoshinoya so who am I to judge? :)  This is the only dim sum place I've gone to in Vegas thus far (maybe I'll try another spot)? Also, keep in mind, my reference point is against SGV dim sum (obvs it wouldn't compare)  Har gow, shu mai, the usual wasn't bad. Vegetables were good and plenty. Tea was always refilled, service wasn't so bad. Egg tarts were extremely runny and strange in texture (but what can I say, I still ate three =). The taro root cake - muy malo. They wouldn't give us water cause there were no clean glasses? (?!?!) At least they were honest.  Quick, dirty, easy. Not bad. :)",

Few, if any, of the wait staff could speak English and they appear to cater to mostly Chinese tourists.  Had difficulty getting our water glasses refilled.  My wife requested another bowl of rice, but it took them 10 minutes to deliver it.  We requested a second dish of an item and after 10 minutes, they finally told us they ran out and had to cook some more -- we cancelled and left.  Servers came by with carts twice, then we could never get them to come by again--worst Dim Sum ever!",

It took a while for our food to come out but it was worth the wait. We ate the corn soup (very delicious!) and we also got the seafood chow mein (so-so), the Kung pow chicken (the best dish of the night!), Mongolian beef (very good as well!), and the Chinese broccoli (lacking in oyster sauce but still good). The prices were what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant (overall we paid about $90 for five family style dishes). And the decor was nice! :) I would definitely come back~",

I went here just to check it out and get some different scenery.  If you like the one on spring mtn this will not disappoint.  It is not as crowded as the other one and has the same great food.  The only downfall is that it is priced slightly higher since it is in a casino, but locals get 20% off the bill, so I guess you almost break even (what more can you ask for, but to break even in a casino).  This KJ's does however have dim sum...please try the taro bun pastry...soooo good!  Same great food & alot of the staff from the one off the strip.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "My husband and I went here on Sunday morning for dim sum and was extremely disappointed. Here's why: (1) Their system for seating customers. When we got there at 11 am, it wasn't too busy. There were three parties ahead of us to be seated. They gave us a number. One of the members in the party after us must speak the language because he was right next to the hostess and kept asking her about when they would be seated. The next thing I know, our number was skipped and they got seated. We thought maybe it's because they have a bigger group and it was a bigger that table came available. Then she started seating other people that came after us. My husband told her that she skipped our number and then she seated us. (2) Little variety. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant with a large aisle. The whole time we were there, the same two carts came through. I asked one of the ladies if they had chicken feet. Instead of saying that she can have the person come over, she said \"later\". Later never came. (3) Service is poor. It was hard to flag down a waiter for refills or for questions. Once they seat you, the waiter does not come back to check on you. When we were done with being disappointed in the food and service and ready to leave, we could not get the attention of a waiter to check us out. My husband gave up and took our check to the register himself to pay it. This is one of the rare time that we did not leave a tip.  On the way out, the line was out the door. In my mind, after what I just experienced, it is NOT worth the wait.",

I've been there 3 times now and it's been about a 2-2.5 star experience.  The food was good the first two times that I was there.  Very traditional dim sum fare.  The most recent time that I was there, the Har Gow was terrible.  No shrimp.  Just this ground up white looking \"meat\" that kinda tasted like chicken.  Service was terrible each and every time.  It was chaotic and the management doesn't seem to care.  Also if you you sit on the far \"stage right\" side of the room, you will not get any food except for the crappy items that no one wants as the carts start on the other side of the room and always run out of the good stuff before it gets to you.  They go back and get more food but then start on that side of the room again.  I'm giving up on this place.  Going back to Beijing Noodle No. 9.",

    "text": "Countless times I have waited in the Carnival buffet line wondering why I am waiting when I could walk in to that great smelling dim sum place across the way. First of all, just because you sell appetizer sized portions of certain foods does not make you a dim sum restaurant.  Having eaten in San Francisco at some of the best Dim Sum locations where the food arrives on carts and you choose what you want for small prices, I was a bit surprised to find that this is nothing more than a chinese restaurant with some unusual items on the menu like clay pots.  The prices, while good for chinese food are not great for dim sum and you won't be able to try 20 different selections unless you want to spend a ton.    The food we ordered was mixed.  The lobster spring rolls had decent chunks of what appeared to be lobster but had no lobster taste to it.  In fact, they were ultra bland.  The walnut shrimp was tasty as was the sizziling seafood which included scallops, calamari, an unidentifyable fish, shrimp and more.  The sweet and sour pork was also lacking in flavor but was not overly soggy.  They are less than generous on the rice portions.  I agree with other reviewers that services is lacking and there is absolutely no atmosphere in this place so don't expect a romantic meal.  I am sure there are better Dim Sum locations within 20 miles of this place.",

    "text": "We've tried some dim sum spots in Las Vegas and KJ at the Rio is our favorite. It still doesn't top what we're used to 2,500 miles away in NYC's Chinatown, but it's close enough and satisfies our appetite. They have a good variety of dim sum and it's served hot like it should be. The soup dumplings are one of the best items, though this past Saturday they weren't very tasty. Maybe just a bad batch? Other favorites are the sesame balls, egg custard tarts, taro buns, pan-fried chive dumplings, and dumplings with peanuts inside. I wish they had sticky rice, the kind *not* wrapped in a leaf. We tend to go early to beat the crowds, so I'm sure we might be missing out on some variety that tends to come out later as mentioned by other Yelpers. What makes it stand out for us is the restaurant is clean, stroller friendly, and the cart ladies are nice, unlike NYC! I guess some might consider that part of the experience but I'm over it. There's always a lot of Chinese patrons, always a good sign. We haven't tried enough of the regular menu to comment on it yet, but I've had the beef pan-fried noodles and they were excellent! Some things I don't like are how they charge for tea. Getting your check added up can take a while. We just walk it up to the back desk ourselves and pay there. Chinese food is generally supposed to be cheap, so when I see outrageous prices at Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas (for example: bowl of won ton noodle soup in NYC - $5, Vegas Strip - $15!) it makes me nuts. KJ is a little pricey but worth it since it's currently the best place in town for dim sum.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review based on my experience over this past Sunday. The restaurant is located inside of a off-strip hotel (RIO) so it's reasonable to expect that a lot of patrons who dine here are guests of the hotel and a mix of locals. I am the latter and neither myself or my dining guest were of Chinese nationality.  We were sat in the middle of the restaurant during a moderately busy Sunday early afternoon and were quickly approached by the food carts (we had no qualms with the delivery of food, with the exception that some dishes were served cold when they should have been hot).   A waiter then approached us once and asked for a drink order. Other than that, there were no efforts made to check on the table. We tried several times to flag down a waiter to get some basics (chili sauce, soy sauce, napkins, etc.) and were met with quick turns of the head as if they \"didn't see us.\" After several minutes of being what we felt were purposely ignored, we noticed these same waiters were very attentive and visited several times the tables seated with all Chinese or mostly Chinese guests. Finally I was able to get the attention of a gentleman I assumed to be the restaurant manager who asked if we needed something. After requesting my simple condiments I received an eye roll from the gentleman and then an \"ok.\" After observing him going back and fourth to other tables after waiting 10 minutes for the delivery of two simple items, we noticed he went back to the main reception desk and stood there, not making an attempt to deliver the items to us. We then had to literally almost grab a hold of another waiter before they acknowledge our presence and again requested our simple condiments, that were then promptly delivered. The (assumed) manager then walked to a table of women sitting next to ours and proceeded to have a full on conversation, even going so far as to sit down at their table and socialize. I did notice on two occasions that he did glance our way and give a rude, irritated look our way as they proceeded to talk. At this point both my partner and myself were fed up with the incredibly rude, purposeful lack of service at our table and asked for the check, which they were quick to get us and wisk away as soon as we put out cash in. When the server looked in the pocket and noticed that I had given 3 $20 bills on a $58.35 check, she asked if we were ready to pay and I nodded yes, she then stood there for a few seconds with a look that almost said, are you kidding with this? no tip? which was purposeful on our account.   This may sound like a rant, and it is, but I want to make it perfectly clear that we were treated with indifference and rudely the entire experience, for what seemed no other reason than that we were not Chinese.   For a restaurant located inside of a hotel to provide this sort of service to it's guests and guests of the hotel is unheard of. This experience reflects poorly not only on the restaurant but the hotel itself.   So my suggestion, if you are not Chinese, then don't dine here because they obviously and clearly do not want your business. Next time, I'll go to a establishment on Spring Mountain.",

    "text": "I went here with a family member. We were at the Rio to see the MJ Live show and asked the box office person to recommend a good place to eat. He said he had just discovered this restaurant was at the hotel and said they had amazing Dim Sum. It is rather hard to see although it is right across from the entrance to the World Buffet. It seems to get dwarfed by it's surroundings. If there is one issue with this place I would have to say it's in the communications area. We asked how the Dim Sum came since the menu did not say if it was priced per piece, two pieces,etc. The current waiter ( we saw three total in a little under an hour) then told us Dim Sum is only served until 3 PM ( maybe they should change the name of the restaurant !) We decided we would just order something else. The menu is quite extensive. We landed on Mushu Chicken appetizer and Shrimp Pan Fried noodles. Waiter #3 came back and asked if we wanted the Pan Fried Noodles Cantonese style...crispy dry noodles on bottom and sauce on top? I said yes, that's the way I like it. The Mushu came out very quickly. It was love at first bite. I can honestly say it was the best tasting Mushu I have ever had. Flavors were perfectly balanced, sauce was light and both the meat and veggies tasted fresh. A delight!  Waiter #3 returned to ask if I was sure that's how we wanted the Pan Fried Noodles reminding me it was dry at the bottom and sauce on top...I said I was sure. Then he came back one more time to ask if we needed silverware...we said no, we are fine with chopsticks. The Pan Fried Noodles came out rather readily thereafter. They were wonderful as well. The noodles were tasty,slightly browned on the bottom and crispy throughout until the top sauce softened them. The sauce was again perfectly balanced in flavors and very light. We told the waiter that everything was really good and he nodded politely. They are not big conversationalists here but are quiet and polite. Either way, the food was superb.  I heard quite a bit of yelling in the kitchen and they seemed to be well staffed with servers and runners and it did look like maybe they were putting forth managerial effort to keep the kitchen from getting backed up. There were a lot of Asian diners and I believe the wait staff is trying to make sure that non-Asians know what they are getting. Some people are upset if it not like American take out Chinese food...and it's not...much more authentic...and it is really good...and I will definitely return.",

At the end of our meal, one of my friends politely asked for a box so she could take the remainder of her food home. Our jackass waiter proceeded to put my friend's plate in the bin with other dirty dishes, then put her left-over food in the box and handed it back to her. THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED. I SAW THIS WITH MY OWN EYES AND WHEN I CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT, HE DENIED IT. I asked to speak to a manager because I was so appalled, but all they did was say \"sorry.\" I was FURIOUS about how they treated us like dirty street rats instead of human beings. 3. If reasons 1 and 2 didn't already convince you not to go here, here is another: 2 of my friends had explosive diarrhea this morning after eating food from this place.  IF YOU WANT SHITTY SERVICE AND EVEN WORSE FOOD, COME HERE. If you're smart, you will stay away and find another restaurant that is cleaner, less expensive and that has a welcoming atmosphere.",

    "text": "Yes, I am a fan and I would return, but probably for lunch, not dinner.  Good & Bad......  Good:   - Food was absolutely amazing and quite authentic based on the vast experience of my companion.  Recommend the salty fish fried rice with scallops and made with egg whites....fresh and light tasting, super delicious....added the Salt & Pepper Squid, also amazing taste and perfect texture....Also the Chicken with Scallions and Ginger....supper yummy.  More than enough food for two.  Needs Improvement:  - Service, probably what you should expect from an authentic Chinese restaurant, abrupt and efficient with little personality. - Pricing, a bit steep even for Vegas, and while the service does not live up to the cost, the food does.  Overall, the experience was very hit and miss.  The food is so good that you reluctantly overlook all the rest of the deficiencies.   Looking around while we were there the large number of groups of Chinese patrons, literally 90+% of the fair number of people there for dinner, made it obvious this is authentic Chinese food.  I could go on with examples, but overall, just remember you are there for the food and nothing else....it is worth dealing with a less than traditional American dining experience to partake in the delicious creations coming from the kitchen.  Yes you will curse me and or yourself for the unorthodox service experience you just got.....but at the end of the meal you will be so happy you ate there and the next day you will want to return to suffer through it all over again for the food.",

I'm only giving this place two stars for the outstanding attentive service from the wait staff. This was at 8pm. Constantly getting refills and making sure we were good. Now that's great service! The food on the other hand... Panda Express has better quality! It's kind of family style eating. We got the Mongolian beef, shrimp pan fried noodles, and sweet n sour pork. The Mongolian beef was kind of slimey almost as if it came out of a can. The sweet n sour pork was decent but the noodles were greasy. Even though the service was great... Food was not. Might be good if you're super drunk and want to sober up on Chinese food.  Not even worth what we paid... should have gone to the BK Whopper Bar instead to get Whoppers and beer :/ Wish we knew about the Famous Dave's BBQ on the way home... Would have gone there instead!",

It was good, but a lot of them didn't understand English. So I also understand why a lot of people probably didn't want to try and go there. But being a dim sum fanatic I still go even if I can't speak to them. To try good food you can't let language barriers stop you. So ya it was just the service I believe that's lacking there.",

    "text": "After eaten at most Dim Sum joints in Vegas, KJ at Rio was definitely one of the better Dim Sum ventures in town.  For travelers like me, the logistic was convenience from the Strip, and the hotel was less rundown than triple P one block west.  The interior beautifully decorated in a big dining area with different sizes of table in column formation.  They got about four different TV on the wall playing sports and Chinese dramas on mute.  For Dim Sum, they got the flavor right with carts flying all over the place, they do seems a bit lacking on the grill stuff, and they are using metal baskets instead of bamboo, which retains excessive water in the dim sum.  However, quality wise still decent for what they got in this town, definitely cannot compare with California level.  They open until 2am, but they do not seem to have any late night special after 9-10pm like most locations in town.  Regular dinner was ok, nothing exciting about it.  We got some Black Bean Beef Chow Fun and a Seafood Tofu Pot.  Both were very good compare to my home state, but just ok if you use Vegas standard.  The bill came to about $50.  KJ Dim Sum at Rio was a solid Dim Sum place with some flaw for their dinner.  I would still come here again for Dim Sum brunch, and probably not dinner.",

    "text": "KJ Dim Sum & Seafood serves mouthwateringly good dim sum at a very competitive prices (S $2.28, M $3.18, L $3.98, SP $4.98).  The restaurant is large with high ceiling, which is nice and gave it a cavernous airy feeling. It is located right across from the Rio's Carnival Buffet, so if you paid too much attention to the line of people waiting for the buffet, you might have to bust a U-ey like I did earlier today.  The dim sum selection is pretty vast.  They have all the usual popular dim sum items and some rare gems (highly recommend #32 Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun is a nice dessert to finish off your meal, but we also used it as our intermission break).  The food were hot every time we ordered it off the dim sum cart and the servers were friendly and timely in refilling tea pots, getting us extra hot sauces and napkins, and clearing away empty plates.  Overall, the food was good. Perhaps not as great as the top dim sum destinations up and down California. However, their Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun (it is so good I am mentioning it twice) with their golden liquidy center is reason enough for me to designate KJ Dim Sum & Seafood as my reigning Las Vegas dim sum spot.    (Review was based on dim sum experience only, but they do have a regular Chinese restaurant menu offering as well).  Ambiance:  4/5  Airy, dining environment with pleasing decor.    Food:  4/5  Overall good.   Value:  4/5  Competitively priced.  Service:  4/5  No complaints.  Parking:  4/5  Parking garage, valet at the Rio.  Might have to stalk some pedestrians back to their car when it is busy.  Cleanliness:  4/5  Pretty clean.  Solid 4 stars in my book.",

This also ranks up there with some of my favorite restaurants in the city.  After sitting down, I recommend that everyone orders the hot tea. It's not complimentary, I think it's like 3 or 5 dollars, but it's unlimited refills, and nothing goes better with dim sum than hot tea.  So there are carts rolling around the place that are loaded with goodies that you can just pick and choose which dishes you want. Definitely if you are going here, I would recommend ordering the har gow (shrimp dumplings), shumai, pork bao, and coeng fan (rice noodle rolls). And, save some room for dessert, their egg custard tarts are fantastic, as well as their green tea and taro buns. But, always be open to trying new things, that's the key to dim sum.  Not everything I thought was stellar. First, the XLB or \"soup dumplings\" are not very appetizing. There is hardly any broth inside, and it's basically all wrapper. And, the char siu baau is pretty average, with it tasting more of sauce, rather than pork. And sometimes another issue I have, not all the dim sum are piping hot, which I feel should be.  Overall, this place is really great, with the positives greatly outnumbering the negatives. Some people have told me that this place is comparable to some of the best dim sum spots in cities that have a large dim sum presence. I believe them because I really like this place, and will continue to come back here!",

This restaurant used dimsum cart that made it more traditional feeling. I quickly grab the traditional dimsum like BBQ pork bun, siew may, ha kao, chicken feet and spare ribs. Cooking dimsum spare ribs and chicken feet are few of the more complex task and this restaurant did well. Overall it is delicious ... I added extra portion on chicken feet as a result.  The porridge is good and tasty as well.  Their chilli sauce is rather unique (unusual than the normal Chinese chilli oil), but it tastes good.  The service is VERY good, as our request is executed flawlessly and timely.   The only opportunity of improvement is in the variety of the food, few we need to order separately.",

As we all know, gambling drains the hell out of everyone and definite stimulates our appetite.  I am a frequent stayer at the Rio and fortunately for myself, dining at KJ has to be one of the most nostalgic experiences I've had.  Let's get one thing straight:  This is not an average Chinese restaurant.  The place is pretty decent in terms of size and has the patience to deal with people that don't really have that patience.  I seriously admire the service staff for putting up with people don't have patience.  They are quick, friendly, and extremely hospitable and that goes without saying that this is the most important aspect of a restaurant.  Food is awesome.  How awesome you say?  Well besides the traditional types of dimsum, you also have to count this restaurant for dinner.  I've had some pretty interesting experiences as well as some nostalgic ones.  You have classic stir fried dishes like Kung pao, as well as individual dishes like crispy chow mein with gravy.  Though that is more of the American side of Chinese cooking, there are some delight-able treats that they have here for an authentic Chinese palate.  I hate to say if anything is truly better than anything else, but they have the best steamed chinese fish that I've ever had and let me remind you that I am a VERY picky eater.  Be warned though, the price is expensive (40 USD for a pound).  Although I won't eat Chinese food everyday but I can appreciate it as it has always been something I've grown into.  If you're around, you just have to stop by and try it for yourself.  I'll be back when I return to my gambling habits once again!",

The dim sum was ehh, not my cup of tea. Most things tasted alright, and nothing stood out.   We waited for forever for a waitress to take our bill and no one came. They totally ignored us probably because we were younger than the other customers. My friend had to walk up to the counter to get someone's attention to pay for our bill.",

Typical order: pork shumai, Chinese broccoli,  chow fun noodles, roast duck ... yep, I can go on forever!  The restaurant is clean, located in the Rio.  The staff works efficiently: carts come around frequently.  Fun experience.  I really like how friendly the staff are ... I come here often and it's nice to be remembered.  The go-to guy is Victor.  Always helpful and friendly!!",

Very very authentic Chinese food. We ordered the honey walnut shrimp, cashew chicken, and lo mein chicken. WOOOW. Wasn't heavy at all and was very filling.  The restaurant itself was very traditional old school type of Chinese restaurant which was pretty cool. Hosts and servers were all very polite and friendly. Price was very very affordable for really goood quality/authentic food. Overall I can't even think of one bad thing about this place. Great experience, excellent food.",

    "text": "KJ Dim Sum & Seafood: First of all, many of the Dim Sum server's didn't speak English, or the ones we got at least. So it was hard to ask any questions, unless the hostess happen to come by. So with that said, communication can be difficult, if you want something in particular.   The Hum Bow's were not the normal BBQ ones, they had a different taste, my friend and I didn't really like them. I like the bread Hum Bow's, but did not see any when we were there, I asked for them, but never got an answer.   Congee was really good, like most places we get. The shrimp noodle rolls were really soggy, this wasn't that good. The siu mai was good, nothing different that I could tell. The Har Gow, shrimp balls were good as most places. The seafood bundle pack, the soggy wrap items were very good, one of my favorites.  We had a custard or egg dessert where the yoke was suppose to be runny, but it was hard and over cooked. The tripe was very good, there was another tripe we got in brown sauce, it was average.  I really need to do pictures, but I think every gets the drift. The place seems a little pricey, but I wouldn't know, as my friend picked up the bill.  Overall, the place was good, I will definitely go back to try other entree's, but the lack of communication makes it difficult to ask for what you want at times.",

Than charged us for the tea that we were not able to finish and for the rice which we didn't order he just brought it with our food!!!!

Egg Tart: They didn't have this on the cart but I asked for it and she got it out from the kitchen so it was fresh. It was good but not the best I've had.  Siu Mai: This was alright. Nothing special about it.  Har Gow: This was alright too.  Spare Ribs: They cut the spare ribs really thin and it was really tender. I thought this was one of the best dishes they had.  Chicken Feet: It wasn't as tender as it should be but the flavor was there.  Bean Curd: I liked this dish too. The filling inside it was good and the sauce was thick and not watery.   Service was eh. They took a long time to give us our tea and for the carts to come to our table. The restaurant was large but not a lot of waiters/waitresses and carts so we had to wait often.

The service was a bit overwhelming, too many people were working and desperate for something to do so they kept coming to the table every two seconds. The next night we even went back and got the sweet and sour pork which was also superb. Will definitely come again on our next visit to Vegas!",

The quality of the food today wasn't as fresh as before and I found myself choking down most of it with our tea. Our usual favorite, the barbecue pork bun was flaky and stale. The waiter is blunt and borderline rude and the wait staff were not as attentive the longer we stayed. We spent a good fifteen minutes asking for dessert but was largely ignored.",

After we received the bill she was told that the 25% does not apply, although the hotel still continues to tell people that it does. Instead of making the effort to check with the hotel about correcting the information that they are giving guests they continued to argue with my friend and refused to give her any kind of discount. Although the food was pretty good and the carts came around continuously, the meal ended on a sour note because of the argument..",

The place was empty when we came in, but there were plenty of servers. My gf and I split the shumai appetizer and a garlic scallion chicken. the other two girls in our group ordered a beef pan fried noodle and the other ordered a seafood pan fried noodle. This is how the convo went down:  Girl #1: \"Hi, I'd like to have the beef pan fried noodle\" Waiter: \"Ok\" Girl #2: \"Hi, I'd like to have the seafood pan fried noodles\" waiter: \"Beef pan fried noodle?\" Girl #2: \"No....Seafood pan fried noodle\" Waiter: \"Ok\"  first the garlic scallion chicken comes out first....almost halfway through eating it, we had to remind the waiter of our shumai. He clearly had forgotten about it and ran to go get it. Fortunately, the shumai was DELICIOUS. the second i bit in, my mouth automatically went MMMMMMMMMM. it was uncontrollable.   then our gf's pan fried noodles FINALLY come out.........guess what comes out? TWO beef pan fried noodles!!!!!!!  my gf pointed it out that she ordered the seafood noodle........and it was hte most awkward exchange ever. the waiter pauses \"OH No my mistake.......\" pauses and looks at her.......and did not immediately even offer to take it back........and my gf is just like it's fine don't worry about it (she obviously didn't want to wait while we were almost done with our food) and he has a sigh of relief an djust leaves it.  NO one comped her meal and he didn't even offer to take it back and just looked at her to see if she would just accept it! Thank goodness she even eats beef!  terrible service, decent food (shumai helped, the chicken was too salty).",

It's probably the nicest cleanest dim sum place you might find in Vegas. Not that others aren't nice, it's just been remodeled very nicely!  As for the dim sum, I'd have to say it's A-OK. Even the prices, I believe probably a tad higher than most, but I didn't mind if I'm sitting in a place I enjoy. The service, probably much the same as other Chinese dim sum restaurants, semi-friendly (?), efficient, but very rushed and a bit frantic.  I'd recommend KJ's for your next dim sum lunch :)",

We tried quite a few of the same things that we had at CH, and I just liked the flavor better at CH. The service is very good, and the price can't be beat.

We came at 12pm, so I'm sure most were just made. - I would definitely get the shrimp rice noodle and crystal shrimp dumpling! My FAVES! - For desserts, get the egg custard and tofu pudding! DELICIOUS!  - Pricing can be pretty steep. Although expensive, this place is WAY BETTER than Orchids.  - If you want dim sum in LV, KJ is a for sure HIT!",

Even though I was the one inquiring, he proceeded to respond to the boyfriend making eye contact only with him, completely ignoring me. After ordering, we got up and left before our meals arrived. The hostess came after us to inquire whether we'd be back. When we responded that we didn't intend to 'cause of the poor service, she left without asking us anything more.",

Brightly lit, clean interior with great service too.  In my opinion the dim sum here rivals those of Seattle and San Francisco Chinatowns.  Even the tea (goke fah or chrysanthemum) was fragrant  and high quality.  Our total bill before tip came to about 70 for seven people, and we ordered lots.  Some standout items included curry fish balls, sticky chicken rice, beef balls, Siu Mai, black bean spareribs, and fried bean curd filled with shrimp.  All of these items had just enough salt and weren't too oil - in fact all still had good texture.  A minor miss is the beef chow fun.  Beef was seasoned well and there was plenty of \"wok breath\", but the chefs here sliced up the rice noodles.  Most of our group were used to llonger wide noodles, and I tend to agree - it would make the dish better.  Imagine eating pasta with spaghetti sliced up and you'll notice the difference!  Still, extremely good quality to price ratio and authentic dim sum.  Service was great and the food does come out fast!",

Hot and sour soup was very bland and the pork they used was also of very bad quality.  Black bean chow fun was very slimy and tasted like super market microwave instant food.   Salt and pepper fish was all batter with very little fish inside.   Minced pork with salted fish was like a slab of purified pork steamed into a grayish patty.   With so many amazing Chinese restaurants in Vegas this is a pass.    You would think when the customer barely touch the food it is a sign that the food is bad.

Feel free to bring your non-Asian friends here--they'll be comfortable!   I'm a big fan of small plates. You get to try everything without feeling like a total glutton. But I can remember coming here a few times (ok, maybe more than a few) where our eyes overestimated our stomach. Perfectly steamed dumplings, chicken feet (yeah, I said it), pork ribs, tripe, and vegetables rolling around on steel carts. Excellence!  My favorites being the aforementioned + the shrimp noodle, Shu Mai, shrimp dumpling & leek dumplings. Basically, you can order anything and be satisfied. I can truly say everything is excellent except for the temp that the food comes off the carts. Some days it's steaming hot. Other days, lukewarm. Either way, it's a small sacrifice for Chinese restaurant servers that actually want to serve you and a place you feel comfortable bringing your friends who would be mortified by the hole in the wall down the street. :) enjoy!",

The food wasn't bad, just a wee bit too salty, a wee bit too greasy and wee bit too much too fast for my liking.  Best of the meal was the Dat Tam dessert.

The sooner they run out, the sooner they can charge for full meal orders. There are better dim sum houses in the Bay Area and LA. It can be extremely busy. On all 3 of my visits, most of the patrons were asian, speaking several dialects of Chinese. That was taken as a good sign, as dim sum is of Chinese origin.   Food Although the menu is pretty big, the food is average to pretty good. The entree  recommendations are roasted duck (1/2 serves 2 people), #4 fried beef rice noodles, and sauteed beef with orange, extra crispy. I haven't tried the soup but it didn't look great. Dim sum highlights are short ribs, BBQ pork buns, crispy shrimp balls, and egg tarts. I can't really recommend anything else. The rest is ok.   Service When busy, the chaos sends the staff into panic mode and anything can happen. The manager, an older Asian man speaking Cantonese and Mandarin, in a dress shirt and Lacoste sweater vest was rude to people in at least 3 languages. Our server was a nice woman from Hong Kong. Many of the bus staff seemed slow to help and quick to argue with other staff.   It's a fun place to watch people, staff and customers when it is busy. There's always some little drama. For the best value, go early for dim sum. Be prepared to wait. Try only recommended dishes. Call ahead and ask about dim sum availability, wait time, and hours. They all seem to change with seasons and holidays.",

Gave them another shot recently when at the Rio for a few days for the Colossus, at the recommendation of a few other players. I won't be back.  Walked in between lunch/dinner and they still had steady business. Waited at unattended hostess stand for about 5 minutes before being acknowledged, despite several servers within eyesight. Couple in front of us left before we were finally seated. The three of us oddly received just one copy of the menu, and we let the server know we were there for dim sum... After ten minutes, we had yet to receive our drinks and the carts were exclusively revisiting the same few perimeter dining tables that were seated with families and no one had even indicated that they would be addressing the tables in the middle of the dining room. We left and went to Orchid Garden up the street instead, were seated and served immediately by friendly staff.",

We had shared the day with a wedding as well so it was chaotic. I can't really tell you about the food that night because it was gone by the time I would sit down so I'm assuming it was delish. We started off with the jelly fish cold cuts platter and it went into assorted dishes such as steamed fish, roast pork, more seafood and veggies. Overall, I could tell everyone was happy and full.   Now dim sum, I can tell you more about. I like that it's at the entrance of the Rio so you don't have to walk across the whole casino to get to it. The casino itself doesn't smell too smokey and did I mention that it opens at 10 am? We just went this past weekend and ordered our favorites. Sticky rice, turnip cake, pineapple bun with custard and with coconut, bbq pork buns, the two staples of dim sum (sew mai and hai gow) and tripe, etc. The dim sum is always delish and even though we spent a good $35 dollars it was well worth it. Service was good considering it just opened for the day and it was a Chinese restaurant. I like that it is clean and nicely decorated.   Overall, KJ is my fav dim sum place and I definitely love it!",

    "text": "The authentic dim sum scene in Las Vegas has always been lacking.  Ping Pang Pong and Chang's Hong Kong have been the two well-known local favorites for a long time.  KJ is certainly a very welcomed new addition.  Located in the Rio Hotel off-strip, KJ is actually just across the street from the Gold Coast Casino where Ping Pang Pong is located.  I can see some friendly competition there LOL!  KJ is a bit more upscale; the ambience is nicer, and of course the place is newer.  The service we had was also actually very good for a Chinese dim sum place.  The last 2 times I was in Ping Pang Pong I actually found the service rather chaotic.  So this is definitely a +1 for KJ.  The dim sum was above average, and actually really good by Vegas standard.  The congee rivaled some of the best in the SGV.  Pork spareribs were yummy and there was more meat than bones.  Cool!  Bean curb wrap was good and so was the steamed taro cake.  We also liked the beef balls although I found the Chinese bbq sauce flavor a bit too overwhelming.  The basic staples - har gow and siu mai - were only average.  The har gow skin was thick and mushy and the shrimp filling didn't taste fresh.  This is really 3.5 stars  but in Vegas we'll need to keep our expectations reasonable, so I'll give it 4 Vegas stars.",

There wasn't that many ladies pushing the carts but they seemed to stop by pretty often.  We ordered Chinese Broccoli and Crispy Noodles from our server and the rest from the ladies with the carts.   Everything tasted decent.  My favorite was the Shu Mai- I could eat like ten of these. I don't know the names for the rest of them but they were all pretty decent, just a tad bit oily.  I also liked the custard egg tarts; it was freshly made as the custard was piping hot but so good.    Again, decent dim sum place but nothing really stood out.  The ladies seemed to only have a couple of different dim sums as there wasn't much variety available when they came by to our table.  I was looking for a few specific ones but they were nowhere to be found :(.",

They have really good Chinese pastries such as the Pineapple Bun (which was served warm, sweet, and coconutty), BBQ Roast Pork Pastry (which is triangular, sweet, savory, and sprinkled with sesame seeds), and Egg Custard Tart.

What was surprising was the restaurant had a good variety of dim sum items; was relatively quiet for a Chinese restaurant; super clean; and the servers were all very attentive.   Our tea pot was constantly being refilled.  They have carts coming around and they always ask if you need anything.  Then when it gets a little more busy they walk around with the items just to make sure you are all being served.  My husband wants to go back again.",

The reviews for this place on Yelp must be written by people who don't quite understand dim sum. It's not Yank Sing or Din Tai Fung, but the food is pretty tasty! They also have pineapple buns, about which we were ecstatic!  We weren't sure what the tab would be, but we had at 7-8 orders off the carts and tea. $37.  We both nearly spit out our tea at the notion of getting authentic dim sum IN CARTS, in Vegas for $45, including tip.   The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I don't care for the individual items being wrapped in paper or metal cups.  Those things were tough to remove, but didn't change the flavor at all.",

I only come early for their dim sum because I like my dishes hot like fire.   Available parking outside by the hotel or in the rio parking garage. If you go early you'll probably get slammed with people or get lucky and find seats super quick. Aside from their super oriental interior design the service is superb. Being Asian American has its perks, I can order in Chinese and sometimes point of course.   The dim sum ladies are everywhere. If you find a cart pushing towards you better order as much as you can because everything looks super delicious. It's delicious, only reason I always come back to the rio.   My favorite couple dishes are the marinated ribs and the meatballs. You can also order the proteins, but the desserts 10/10. Taro bun and the red bean puddings are my two go to desserts.   Service, food and the atmosphere really adds to the overall dining experience. I always have a great time eating here and so are the guests I bring along with me.   Highly recommend everyone to try this fine establishment. You cant go wrong with dim sum for breakfast or brunch.",

They serve Dim Sum during the most limited time window of any \"Dim Sum\" restaurant I've ever seen in my life, basically only for a few hours around lunch.. I just wasted a drive here to learn this after midnight when I was already down the road from another Dim Sum restaurant that actually serves Dim Sum until 4am. I'd just wanted to try out a new place. And apparently according to the server this is an ongoing issue but the owner won't do anything about it. The table that was seated next to me had the same problem. Change your name or serve Dim Sum whole you are open. It's not rocket science. You're not actually Dim Sum restaurant. You're a place with a dim sum lunch special. To name yourself such is downright dishonest.",

The waiter checked on me often, and even gave my my leftover tea in a soup container, along with my food. The thing I hate is how the restaurants reek of cigarette smoke. This makes me eat my food fast, just to get the hell out of there! I know its not their fault, but damn! Meal was 22.00 not bad at all. They also said they don't use MSG which is great, because I'm allergic to it. Would come again if ever in Vegas, but I will wait another 16 years, like the last time I was here. LOL",

I was super excited when I saw there was a dim sum place in the hotel where we were staying. Even if it wasn't great, I was hoping it would satisfy the craving. Turns out it was delicious! On par with what you'd get in Chinatown in Seattle. The first cart came by as soon as we sat down. There are a ton of choices and extremely reasonably priced (especially for Vegas). We got 4 selections and our bill was only $15. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that we were through about half of our dumplings before the actual waitress came by to give us drinks. I'm planning on going again before we leave.",

Once we finally sat down, we ordered the usual foodies and was not disappointed. The typical dishes were fresh and not heavy and greasy as we have come to expect at similar venues.   Service was rather attentive and the push cart ladies were friendly and generally sincere in trying to help you get a particular dim sum dish.   In addition to the hoard of dim sum dishes we ate, we also ordered a few rice/noodle dishes. The salted fish chicken fried rice was a disappointment as it was bland and seemed out of place with the use of uncooked shredded cabbage. We also ordered a few other noodle dishes. Nothing spectacular, just okay.   Stick with the dim sum and you will not be disappointed.",

I did very much enjoy the food that I did get, and I felt the service was good.   Prices were a bit high, but it is Vegas.      steamed dumplings.  Very good.          Roasted Duck I ordered both times I was there.  Very tasty.      Sweet n Sour Pork, was good, but I have had better.  FYI....They don't serve rice with your dishes, you have to order/pay for it separate.",

First impression - I like that the restaurant feels inviting. One spacious, modern, open room, not a hole in the wall.  To my dismay, my feelings changed as soon as I tried some of the dishes. The food was disappointing. I regretted my craving choice. Most of the things we ordered were cold or just awful. The worst one was the beef spare ribs. So greasy, fatty, gummy, and boney. My shrimp wontons were cold. Chow fun were short pieces and dry, just the opposite of how I like them. Those ribs left a horrible taste in my mouth the whole day. The only thing that were decent were the shu mai and the shrimp flat rice noodle.  Other saving graces were the decor, no wait, and the excellent service even though I'm not Chinese. The dim sum ladies were nice, explained what some of the items are, the server checked up on us, etc.   Our bill was $38 for two before tip.",

    "text": "There is something very comforting about dim sum... it's fast, it's cheap, it's warm and savory and it gives you the same freedom of variety as tapas does.  I love dim sum, and I have been used to the best in Manila because of our proximity with China.  But when we moved here to Vegas, it's been quite a challenge looking for good dim sum.  Thanks to the suggestion of a dear friend, we've decided to give it a go.  The first thing you immediately notice is the vibrancy of the place.  High ceilings, uncrowded tables, red walls, soft lighting and very clean/crisp table cloths.  So often you see dim sum places pay little attention to details. (The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)    We came early thinking to avoid the crazy rush hour which we did, but unfortunately could not order anything off the dim sum menu since the chef arrives at 11:15am.  Make sure you go after that time of you want to enjoy their fried rice, noodles or other entrees.  But you will have plenty to choose from the dim sum carts whizzing by - from congee/rice porridge with century egg, silken tofu, fried shrimp wantons, egg custards, taro cakes, pork buns and dumplings.  Our favorites were the steamed pork buns, hargaw or shrimp dumplings and the sweet spare ribs.  They tasted like they were all freshly made and although they still do not quite compare to the stuff we grew up with, esp from Binondo (Chinatown)... they are the best dim sum I've had so far in Vegas.  If I had one small quibble, it's that the soy sauce in their Kikkoman jars did not taste like Kikkoman.  Heh.",

We ordered some fried rice that they never put in and we had to inquire repeatedly about it. It finally arrived after we were full.   FLASH FORWARD to today. We dined there with some friends. It took FOUR servers to come to our table to get our drink orders and then another few for us to FINALLY get some water, soy sauce and some orders in. Was it because we weren't Chinese. Yes, I'm using the race card because all the other Patrons who were Chinese got waters without having to repeatedly be ignored and passed by. Lastly, although we were done, not a single person came to even ask if we're ready for our checks, refill waters, ask us if we're alive!! WORST SERVICE EVER! AND THE FOOD... well it's not worth the service. Not even a small bit!! Never coming back to this joint!",

Do not come to early because the all food might not be ready yet, do not come too late otherwise there might not be anything left. That sweet spot when it is busy enough for fresh turn over is the sweet spot. Around here, it is sometime between noon and 1:30.   Beware of the flood gates. When you do come around the before mentioned time, the thongs of antsy Chinese people will bum rush the hostess stand. Get your number and back away slowly. No one needs to get hurt. Stand too close to the podium and you will get stampeded.   It is hard to go wrong when you come with a group of eight people, load up the lazy susan and still walk away with a relatively small bill. The food is good and was steaming hot when it hit the table. The taste was some of the best in town. The only complaint is that they ran out of so many dishes. By the end of our lunch, the meager pickings would not satisfy the avid dim sum goer.   The food: all the classics are solid. Har gow, shu mai, chicken feet, veggies in bean curd wrappers, pan fried noodles, and veggies sauteed with garlic are all tasty. The desserts are the star here. We were warned to save room for all the sweet treats. In the end, half of them were out and we were disappointed. No sesame balls, no soft bean curd, only eight sad faces. Like Tony T. mentioned, the Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun is worth mentioning.",

That made it kind of a frustrating dining experience. Our party ordered noodles and they said instead of getting it from the dim sum cart they will prepare it fresh from the kitchen. So we waited. And waited. And waited. And when we could wait no more (halfway through our meal), we asked the waiter to check on it for us. Then a few minutes later a plate of cold noodles appeared on our table. We could have sent it back but we figured we would have to wait again so we all just ate what we were dished and called it a passable meal experience.",

When I went to KJ for the second time in about a week with a friend, my husband made me get three orders of the mouth watering treat to go. He said don't bother coming home without it. True story.  KJ Dim Sum is located in Rio, across from the Carnival World Buffet. Tip: Prime parking is if you turn on Valley View, there is a parking lot and garage that is MUCH closer than if you enter through the main entrance.  The restaurant is large and can accommodate large groups. Just be prepared for a wait if you go during prime hours. The wait staff is good. They kept checking that our tea pot was full every few minutes.  They have a great selection of dim sum, a lot of the usual that I get in other dim sum places in town. Surprisingly, the prices are very good for being in a casino. I wish I knew the names of the items I love... I just point to whatever looks good! I love this fried seafood ball that comes with a mayo dipping sauce. Their shu mai is also very tasty. But like Tony T. said twice, and I will also mention two more times, the Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun will win you over!",

    "text": "Really good dim sum place located inside the Rio!   Minus one star because some of the items off the cart weren't that hot and I hate when they try to shove plates on you that you don't want to order, or perhaps you already have enough to eat.    I noticed a lot of Chinese people in here, which is always a good sign!  Our bill for 2 people came to $26 and we took a bunch home.  We did order too much, so possibly next time it would be less.  If you like Dim Sum, definitely stop by this spot.  They serve from 11am-2pm.  P.S.  You really don't need to valet to eat here.  They have a big lot right outside the entrance where you can self park.  Save your tip money and park yourself.",

    "text": "Everything was DELICIOUS. Definitely one of the best dim sum I've ever had. They charge $1 for tea per person which it's pretty expensive in my opinion. Service wasn't great. They probably took over 30 minutes to bring us our shrimp noodle and the waiter we asked to check on it was to lazy to check and just brushed us off saying he doesn't know when it will be out. I assume service isn't always like this therefore I would come back when I want dim sum while visiting.",

The food was served from the carts, which is personally my favorite. The food was good and flavorful.   Dinner. I ordered the fried rice with beef. Yummy!  String beans:wowzers  Fried tofu with shrimp: okay  Chicken : can order whole or half. Pretty delicious.  All the food came in a generous portion. The price for the food is expensive but it is the way it is bc its in a casino. Overall delicious",

    "text": "Dined here on Sat, Feb 22. The service was one of the worst I've ever experienced.  The restaurant was less than half full, and it was close to 10pm, with plenty of waiters. So there was no excuse.  My husband and I ordered soup, mongolian beef, and steamed rice to share.  After 15-20 minutes, no soup had appeared. But our waiter dropped the mongolian beef on our table and before he ran off, my husband reminded him that we had ordered soup. More time passed, and no soup. Also, no rice had been delivered to us, so we couldn't really enjoy the Mongolian Beef, which was getting colder by the minute.  Finally a different waitress stopped by and we told her we were waiting for our soup.  She disappeared into the kitchen, and finally our original waiter came out with the soup and served it to us. We reminded him about the rice, and he said the rice wouldn't be ready for five minutes.  We ate our soup, all the while our beef dish sitting getting cold, and still no rice.  A different waiter stopped at our table, and we asked for rice and she said it was ready. Eventually someone brought it to us.  The food wasn't bad, but being from the Bay Area, it's nothing above average.  But the service pretty much ruined the meal for us.  Also, it was very overpriced. $13.95 for hot & sour soup, the other soups were $19.95. Mongolian Beef was I think $12.95.  All the food at the Rio is overpriced though. See my other review about their \"All American Bar & Grill.\" Another bad experience. I would be really afraid to have Dim Sum there and not know how much you were being charged until the end. Oh, and the family at the table next to us got into an argument with the waiter about their bill at the end of their meal.  Would definitely not recommend this place.",

The restaurant is clean, and service is ok as expected for an Asian restaurant. They push around the dim sum carts and you can just point to whatever you want to eat. The quality of their dishes are pretty good and the price was reasonable.",
