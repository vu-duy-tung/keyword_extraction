Was going to write a scathing review but all you have to do is look at their Google and Yelp reviews (with the exception of the obvious \"good\" reviews from their friends) and you will get an idea of the quality of food they are sending out the door.  YUCK quite possibly a health hazard. My advice to Sicily's; close your doors before someone gets really sick.",

The prices were pretty decent but the coupon for 2 mediums any way I want for only $11.99 looked perfect.  When I called to place my order, the girl was very friendly and answered my questions without any attitude (not an easy thing to come across in Vegas).  The man who delivered the pizzas was very friendly as well.  I hoped the pizzas were as good as the service....and let me just say, they were better!!  Oh my goodness....the crust was perfect...crispy on the outside and hot and doughy on the inside.  The sauce had good flavor and there wasn't too much of it.  The cheese and all the toppings were fresh and delicious.  I have finally found a great pizza place in Vegas.....it has only taken almost 9 years LOL",

I was ok with that but after 1 hour and 30 min has past and I called a lady picked up the phone and couldn't find my order!!!!!! What!!!!!! So she finally found it after asking me 15 questions and placing me on hold for 5 minutes, the delivery JUST left our restaurant, so here I am pissed that 1 it has been 1 hr and 40 min now, 2 she couldn't find my order which probably didn't make until I called. When food got to my house it was cold, the fries were soggy, jalapeno popper weren't fried but baked!!!!!!! Disgusting food to be honest never ever again I will order from here",

The crust is similar to pizza hut but not nearly as oily, n they put a good amount of cheese on there. The best so far is Garlic Chicken, u have to try it, frickn awesome...one problem is pizza runs a lil small compared to other Italian pizzerias, the small is like a personal size, medium is a small, large is medium size n x-large looks like a basic large size. So of u r hungry n have to share be sure to order an X-large!",

Unfortunately the system would never load past the screen where you add menu items to your \"cart.\" I called the number to order from the store since the website wouldn't work. The girl on the phone mumbled and made me repeat our street name 4 times and made me spell it 3 times. It's not a strange street name so I'm unsure what her problem was. She took down my order but not my payment info so who knows if this pizza will show up anyway.",

Cell phone dropped call.  Called again.  Drove to pickup the pizza and went to the wrong place.  Called again.  And then I told them it was the web's fault.  (Opps, it was my bad after all.) These guys are so patient.  Not a sarcastic tone or anything.  Really pleasant to talk to.  And then the pizza.  I cannot ever make up my mind so I ordered two.  Can always put it in the fridge or freezer for other times. Had a piece of each. The spinach with feta, mushrooms, cheese and garlic-butter sauce was heavenly and the meatball and mushroom pizza with marinara was to die for. Both pies had just the right amount of each ingredient.  The crust was the perfect balance of crisp and dough.    It may not be the closest pizza joint to where I live, but they have my business no matter what the hour.",

The call taker then puts me on hold for ten minutes. I hung up and called again where the call taker picks up the phone immediately , just to put me on hold again.  Pizza arrives at 8:33pm with a delivery driver explaining to me that the delivery service simply gets too busy on Saturday nights. The pizza boxes were hot, so I decided to go ahead and pay for the pizzas. Delivery man frowned when I gave him a one dollar tip.  Upon opening the pizzas, cheese had hardened, pizzas were lukewarm.  Called back to complain to management where I was asked by the call taker for the details of my complaint. I was vague and asked again to speak to management. Once again I was put on hold and call taker had hung up on me. I can go on, but feel this is enough information for one to see the gist of my WORST PIZZA EXPERIENCE EVER.",

    "text": "my sister and I are regulars at this pizzeria. we have grown addicted to the delicious Veggie Calzone.  it is a great deal for about $8. the pizza is best in town.Our family only orders from this eatery because we like the consistency of high quality ingredients, perfect authentic New York style pizza, and fast service with a sincere smile. top all that with an unbeatable price , plus 24 hr delivery. there is no other place like it. we have tried over 80% of Pizzerias around the Las Vegas Valley; all disappointed us in one way or another. We order from them at least twice a week - kids, post-soccer game gatherings, fund raisers, office staff catering.. they will make sure the order is correct, hot, delicious, and delivered fast. they are open 24/7. it is owned by Mr. Alban and his family of experienced pizza aficionados. the 2 chefs really know how to bring out that rich, mouth watering Italian flavor in all the dishes. our favorite is daytime Masterchef Mr. Joey. He is 100% Italian and speaks fluent French.He perfected his cooking techniques from a long line of chefs in his native country. He grew tired of being overworked and under paid at other restaurants and settled down at Sicily's because he feels a kinship to the locals. He has a real passion for food and aims to serve up only the best. The families across the street at the park can smell the rich aromas of made-to-order pizza and chicken wings. The meat is soft, juicy, and tender. It is Divine!  I have read other Yelpers reviews regarding unsatisfactory experiences. I urge you to read the online menu carefully so you know what the order will include. if you are calling in an order after midnight, be patient; staffers are humans too- they are exhausted after a long night. lastly, kindly understand that delivering hot foods at 1-4am to hard-to-find locations is tough; be more specific in giving helpful directions by adding in the online 'comment' or call the store yourself. WE have all worked in service industry at one time in our lives; it is not easy.. Our neighbors, mommy groups, other office colleagues , friends all  love this place and we hope Mr. Alban will grow the business and serve up superb Italian cuisine 24/7 in Las Vegas!!",

    "text": "Avoid!! I ignored the reviews and ordered anyway off of the Eat24 app mostly because it's was after 1am and was only one of very few open places that delivered.  We ordered: bread sticks plus mozzarella, Athenian  (Greek) fries, a turkey sub sandwich, and chicken tenders. We received our order in a moderately acceptable time frame. I say moderately because we would have our food around 15 min earlier had our delivery driver actually brought the food to our door or understood our directions to get to our place from the front gate. Instead, we had to leave in our pj's and meet him to get our food. We order delivery often and have never had anyone unable to find our door before.   Now to the biggest issue- the food.   YUCK! The fries were soggy with burnt edges and sprinkled with feta cheese. That's it. No flavor and terrible texture. The chicken tenders were baked, bland, and not crispy. The breadsticks were sadly the best of everything and that's not saying much; incredibly greasy and hard. The turkey sandwich was in fact a calzone with ham in it! After all of that we called for a refund or at least to get the sandwich we ordered.   We spoke to one person and explained the issue twice, we were put on hold and a different person answered. We explained the situation for a third time and he asked \"so what's the problem?\" Really? We explained we ordered through the app and he asked what we wanted. We wanted the sandwich! He tried to tell us the calzone IS IN FACT the sandwich and that's how they make it. So you make turkey sandwiches as ham calzones?? We had to stress several times this was no sandwich and in fact ham. He wanted to send the same driver (that we had to meet) to pick it up since apparently they have to bring it back for the owner to see the next day in order to do anything for us. We requested our money back instead since none of the food was satifisfactory and apparently just giving us a sandwich was too difficult. He explained in a tired tone that he would have to call the Eat24 service team to refund us and that it would take a while blah blah blah. It was obvious this guy was unwilling to help us or try to make it better since apparently it was all too much hassle for him, so we gave up and threw all the food away.    If you can't be bothered to do something minimal like give a customer a freaking sandwich they paid for when they weren't even making a big deal out of the other awful food, you don't deserve to be in business or to get any of money ever again. Listen to the reviews and don't order here!!",

And promise to bring back a correctly made salad and not bring it. Called again later and the woman had the audacity to ask why I was calling a couple hours after I ordered, because y'all obviously don't know how to make a correct order OR follow through on correcting a mistake. They told me they can't do anything since I called back so late but OK to whatever person I spoke to earlier you apparently don't actually exist. Don't do it y'all.

That sounded a heck of a lot better after a few drinks but now sounds ridiculous as I type this.    The Hawaiian side touted double Canadian bacon, double cheese and double pineapple.  Everything was doubled but the bacon.  The Margherita side was just a cheese pizza with basil and sliced tomato slapped on the top.  The cheese was also burnt on that side due to the fact that the Hawaiian side took longer to cook.  I blame myself.    You should ask for a takeout menu before you order because they have coupons you can use right on the spot like 2 x-large (which is actually just a large) pizzas any way you want them for a little less then $18.",

    "text": "I received a door hanger with coupons and the deals were too good to pass up. Two medium pizzas any way you want them for like $16. Can't get unlimited toppings for that price anywhere! So I ordered carryout without paying much attention to the address. They were a little far from my house to receive a door hanger, but they were worth the drive. The guys inside were super friendly and asked if I had had their pizza before. I said no and was shocked to find out they've been in business for about 10 years. Those door hangers really do the trick for advertising. The pizza was absolutely delicious, really tasted home made rather than \"pizza franchise\" like some others. I think possibly some of the reviews about long waits and cold pizza are due to their much larger than normal delivery radius. But hey, if you want to order pizza 24/7 from further away than most places will deliver, you can't expect it to be there in 5 minutes. I will definitely order from these guys again and support their business.",

For starters we waited literally 10 mins short of TWO HOURS for our food, and to me i get it your busy but what the hell does it take 2 hours for a pizza deliverer for a pizza and wings seriously? i'm in shock that it took seriously two hours. THEN when i called at the hour and about fifteen mark to the store asking what was going on, i got the rudest attitude from an employee, stating there was no order under my number.. WHEN I GOT A CONFIRMATION TEXT. and then i said that and he allll of a sudden found my order, he proceeded to tell me he spoke with the driver and the driver stated he would be there in less than five. *shows up forty mins later* ONCE the pizza arrived it was cold, along with the wings. Safe to say wont ever order from here again.",

There is a pizzeria in my hotel but I wanted to try this since they had put flyers on the room doors.  Security wouldn't even let the delivery person inside (because the flyers had been distributed illegally) so I had to track him down.  $4 delivery fee to boot.   I'm anticipating the aftermath tomorrow won't be any better than the taste of this crappy pizza. . I hope the flight home isn't too uncomfortable!!   It wasn't even good cheap pizza-- so a 2 star \"because it's cheap\" is bogus!  We even said \"it's a shame we just got the pizza and it tastes exactly like it would of it had set in the microwave overnight!\"  Nasty!",

We ordered a two medium special for 14.99, bill was 20 and change with delivery not including tip.  We ordered a four topping pizza and a specialty pizza with two items removed and one added.  Pizza arrived quickly, but when we opened the boxes one pizza was correct and the other was a plain cheese pizza.  Called the driver back (had the number from him calling about the gate code), he said the order was for a cheese pizza and the four topping, so not like he switched boxes and the order could be quickly corrected. We settled for what we got.  The pizza quality was terrible. I was starved going in and could only eat a little before giving up. The toppings were ok, but very scarce, sauce tasted like canned tomato paste.  The worst part was the crust, which might be the worst crust I've had on a pizza; it was thick, hard, and similar to cardboard.  I would have been much more satisfied with a frozen pizza.",

It did get here in a good amount of time unlike my last experience with this place. But the wings were hard and had no chicken on them what so ever, they were way over fried. I guess you should never order anything but pizza from a pizza place. The cheese sticks were cold.",

It was reheated and stale, i ordered the extra pepperoni stuffed crust, and it had a layer of  pepperoni over a 2 day old stale hard disgusting old pizza.  Seriously so gross, I over tipped (I also ordered baklava which I also don't recommend because it's a tiny sliver and not worth it) but gave the guy $28 and am so mad at myself!  THIS PIZZA IS NOT EDIBLE! And I mean that in the most serious way, I'm literally not able to chew this gross thing I received (cannot even tell if it is stuffed crust it is so hard) ugh bummer was dying for pizza and wish I would have spent my hard earned money else where.  I will NEVER order here again yuck.",

    "text": "I places an order for Sicily's pizza from Grubhub. The ETA was one hour later for a total of 2am. This was later than I hoped for, but I went ahead and ordered because I really wanted some late night food. By 3am, two hours after ordering, I had yet to receive my food and called the restaurant to see what was going on. Because it was so much later than originally anticipated, all I wanted to do was go to bed and decided to cancel the order. I informed the sales rep of my choice and was told I would have to reject the delivery in person even though the company was more than an hour late at 3am and it might be another 15 minutes minimum.  I called Grubhub customer service who contacted the restaurant on my behalf. The Grubhub representative was told that the order had not even been cooked yet. Grubhub cancelled the order for me at that time.  This restaurant is very unreliable and the people who answer the phones give half truths to get you off the phone as quickly as possible while refusing to help you.  I will not place an order with them again.",

The jalapeno poppers had hardly any cheese if any, and the order if fries that cost 3.00 was about as much fries as a value fry from a fast food restaurant. Wasn't really happy with the quantity of food for the money I spent. But they are the only ones open for delivery in the wee hours around where I work, and it's cheaper if you order from their website than doordash or grubhub.  The best thing was the pizza, I will most likely order from here again but it will only be if I don't have enough time to stop somewhere before work for food.",

The crust had a garlic bread taste to it, but the topping wasn't all that. The cheese can use more flavor and need to add more ham into the pizza.   I would give this place another try just not anytime soon. They didn't have bad service so I can not complain.",

I finally got a call from the driver at 3am he couldn't find my house I was on the phone for 7 minutes he was parked down the street walking from complex to complex from what the driver had explained to me, I had to keep repeating myself to get him to understand where I lived.After all that my food was cold I did not eat it.I call Sicily call center back explained to Jenny what happened she said call Sicily tomorrow for a full refund tell them Jenny said so or go in with your receipt. I went to the store they couldn't give me a refund because the manager wasn't there.Next day I call the manager Dimitri and tried to tell him my problem all he did was yell at me saying your wrong Jenny doesn't have the authority to give refund, every chance I had to talk he just yelled, I had to hang up he was so angry with me, I don't understand why.i guess it's just a loss, not that they care but they will not get another dime from  me.",

The cook in the back says are you here for pick up. I say no, I would like to order. He says OK, then the guy outside of the store acknowledges that I actually entered his store and said, you'd like to order, I said yes. He walked Half way behind the register and then stopped and spoke to the chef, they continue on with a whole entire conversation as I literally just stand there and watch. I walk out the damn store.I will never return. They need to just close the place there aren't any good reviews from what I see. They need to just let it go.",

But the pizza is what has me going back.  It's fresh and cooked well. He makes it right in front of you.  It has so much flavor and the crust is amazing.  I'm sure the bad reviews are made up by competing companies (pizzerias) because even the prices are are affordable.  For a small pizza it's about $5 and it feeds about 3 people for the medium I think it's just $6.  But don't trust my word for it.  Just try it yourself.  I'll say I've never ordered while Joey wasn't there. So maybe his workers may not provide the best service, that again isn't something I've experienced. However what I can say is that I love this place.  Very small humble delicious pizzeria !   Enjoy !!",

This has to be some of the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. Idk how it's still open.   I had ordered a BBQ chicken pizza. There was barely any sauce whatsoever on the pizza, and also barely any toppings. It was basically just bread/crust mostly.   The jalapeno poppers were the worst I've ever had in my life. The frozen food section has better ones. These had no flavor and they seemed to be extremely poor quality.",

Next time I ordered we were really sick in the room and the point of delivery was to not leave the room. Lazy delivery guy calls and insists I come down to get it that he wouldn't be able to because of security (which is crap, we ordered at the same time last time), and I tell him I'm not feeling well and the point of delivery was to not leave the room, but he insists, completely defeating the purpose. I could have just gone downstairs. Says 5 mins, leaves me waiting downstairs looking and feeling like crap in public for 20. Oh, and there was no security, so he could have come up no problem.  Oh, AND when ordering, mentioned the missing item from last time and they neither refunded me the difference or offered a \"free\" item to make up for the $5 they effectively stole. She just commented that there's no note on my file - and I said because I intended on ordering again and was just going to mention it now since it's not like they're going to make a trip back just for missed dessert. (Second order was only a couple days after the first.)  About the actual food - cheese pizza is really good, other pizza we had with mushrooms wasn't good, and caesar salad is an awful waste of money (really stale croutons were gross).",

Order pizza at 7:40pm Sunday night 9:15 call in too ask where the delivery was (2 medium pizzas) they can't seem to get a hold of the driver  and asked me to keep waiting for him to show up I said it will be cold at this point and ahe disregarded what I said. Fast forward to 9:30 called back and they still can't get a hold of the driver and I ask for a refund and then to make it right by giving a voucher or something for another time. She says well I didn't even get approval for your refund I was doing it without authorization \"like she was doing me a favor\". She said only the owner could do it ans the owner will call me (still no call from the owner). Then the driver calls me and says he is at my door I said well I am home knock on the door. Nope that isn't even working he is across the street and tries to say his address doesn't show an appt number (my text confirmation does though) hmmm. (And he is at an apt so did he just pick a random one to walk up to). Gets better yet. Takes him 5 more minutes to walk across the street to give me two stone cold pizzas. I called the company back to tell them about this and my to make sure I am getting a refund cause I have no proof... and said The owner never called me. They said she will call you right now. Nope that wasn't right either manager called me. Not from the store and she makes it worse by saying we gave you a refund what more do you want. I said edible hot food would be acceptable and maybe something to make it right. Nope she made that worse and said she \"comped\" me already she made it \"right\". I said oh you always offer free cold food and 2 hours delay ruined evening and still left me with no dinner. (It was disgusting to even look at I took a bite and it had a sour taste not sure why if it was because it was cold maybe idk) so they think terrible service is ok if it turns out \"free\" and ruins your evening and your still hungry and have to go get food now to feed everyone.  I am in customer service and this manager is going to ruin the owners business and apparently has no entrepreneurial skills to say this kind of stuff. There box says \"we appreciate your business\" maybe the owner does but the staff here does not.",

When I got my order I also asked for some more red peppers, a cup water, and some napkins.  The owner (a guy with one tooth, or so he appeared) brought me the peppers, but not the water or napkins.  I asked again for both and he brought me some water grudgingly -- it had no ice.  I asked about the napkins and his response:  \"Is that it, do you want me to keep going back and forth -- for a $5 order?\"    Can you say a-s-s-h-o-l-e?  As if whether the fact that I chose to patronize his establishment and paid $5 or $50 should make a difference in the way I'm treated.  All I do is to recommend:  \"STAY AWAY!\"",

So here's a tip: NEVER trust a 24 hour delivery food place!  I am giving one more star than I should because the delivery guy was very pleasant. Poor guy; he probably wishes he could warn people about the food if he wasn't getting paid to bring it to us.   The pizza and breadsticks tasted like they were sitting on the counter for 45 min before they left the store. I've had better pizza from the frozen food section at Walmart. Seriously! (Digiorno's garlic bread pizza... To die for) the first word that comes to my head to describe Sicily's pizza is... rubber! Just. Bland. Rubber.  We used a coupon deal (2 mediums for $14.99) so in actuality, we really got what we paid for.   Bummer.",

    "text": "I ordered food from here and after an hour of waiting, decided to check the reviews on yelp. There was a consensus on the time it took to deliver the food which was exceedingly long. I called back and the woman stated the food was on its way. I also read the food was lousy and seemed as if it had been reheated. Here is my opinion:  Delivery time was terrible. I was told 45 mins to an hour and it took 1.5 hours. I was not compensated for this extended delivery time. As I read in other reviews, I don't believe it was the drivers fault so I still gave him a tip.   Food quality, contrary to the majority of other reviews was good. I ordered the steak and cheese sandwich, fettuccine Alfredo, side salad, fries, and the cinnamon sticks. My sandwich came in the form of a calzone and was tasty. It was warm when it arrived. The fries, like other reviewers have stated, were warm but soggy. They were the steak fry type and sometimes those are soggy no matter what. The side salad was great and I was told by my wife the ranch dressing was very good and not too bitter. The cinnamon sticks I have to say we're extremely good.  They gave me a strawberry jam type of topping to put on the sticks and it was excellent.   Overall I gave this place 3 stars. The delivery service I received is the main reason I gave it an average review. I ordered from this place because they placed a flyer in my hotel door. In the future I will check reviews before I blindly order from a flyer, but if you are aware of the extended delivery time, it's worth a try.",

I should have known, but I was drawn by what I thought was an awesome coupon deal. You know how you order delivery, and the food smells good? That's not the case here. It reeked of onions.  The pizza was undercooked and bare. I had the Supreme which was overloaded with diced raw onions and barely had any other toppings. Also, I never thought anyone could screw up Buffalo wings. It's just fried wings with buffalo sauce, but they couldn't even do that. The wings looked unsauced and when I asked the driver about it, he was confident that the sauce was there. After a closer inspection I understood, and it was right then and there that I realized their idea of buffalo sauce is lightly dyed grease. Besides a very faint smidge of color in the grease, there was no hint of buffalo at all. The wings were really old, as if they were reheated and chilled several times. That was most likely the case. I tossed them away fearing food poisoning in my near future.  I am hoping I can stomach the rest of my pizza after reheating it myself. I wish I could get a refund, but I don't want to put up a fight just to hear that they won't provide one. Potential customers, please do yourself a favor and stay clear; the only valuable thing you'd be ordering here is a life lesson.",

You can order a $7 large pizza with Canadian bacon and you will get a quality pizza with an amazing flavor, unlike the cardboard tasting stuff you get at the other fast food chains.   This place is open 24 hours and the owner is always there to greet you when you drop by to pick up your pie and gives you deals on drinks or dipping sauces if you are a regular at his place. Oh, and speaking of dipping sauces, make sure you get some BBQ wings to dip in ranch!",

    "text": "I agree with my friend, Phillip, Holly, and Lauri.  If you're a \"stoner\", and it's the \"wee hours\" of the morning, and you don't want to be bothered to make a Frozen Pizza, and just have to have Pizza, this is the only reason you go, or call this place.  On the positive side, they are open 24/7 and deliver. So, if you are unable to drive, this beats a DUI. That's about it.  First, if you look at the pictures, you will note that you can certainly taste the cheese in the Pizza. That's because they are very stingy with the toppings. I dare you to find the Italian Sausage on a Sausage Pizza. Good luck.  Very inconsistent taste, and not that good.  I get my Pedicures next door to this place and was curious. So, one day I had to feed the workers at my house, and thought, \"I can feed a group, and get off cheap.\"  I also bought a medium, only $5, for my pet groomers.  I paid the price. The next day, my workers boycotted my house, and the pet groomer mysteriously canceled my regular appoinment to have my Pug bathed and groomed.  My image for being generous with my help, took a big hit.  Lesson, if you are stoned and really have a bad case of the \"munchies\", don't spoil the exerience with this Pizza. Find someone who is sober, and make the journey to Jack In The Box.   No matter how bad you think Jack In The Box is, it's got to be better than this place.",

    "text": "So I got home last night and was craving something to eat. I didn't have much in the house because I hadn't been to the store in awhile.  I did a search for \"delivery\" on Yelp to see what would turn up. Lo and behold I discovered this place was fairly close to me and I'd never tried it.  So having had a few beers and few shots of tequila I figured what the hell I'll give it a try.   I ordered a Hawaiian Pizza a order of wings and a bottle of Pepsi. The food was at my door quicker than any delivery I've ever had!  I'm very picky about wings. Most places seem way under cooked for my taste. These wings were great. My only complaint was they had just a bit two much sauce on them. I'd probably strain them next time just to let a bit of it drip off. But they were really tasty!  The pizza was great! So good in fact this is gonna be my new pizza place to order from.  I only ordered a medium one last night as it was the first time I'd ordered from them. It was so good last night that I ordered a large one for breakfast LOL seriously. I'm typing this as I await it's arrival. I'm just waiting to hit the post button until it arrives in case they're slower this time.  Yep...very fast again. I'm off to have breakfast   :-)",

Not only that, when we called and asked for a refund, we were told that we could only have the food replaced, and said we had to call the manager. Terrible service and even worse food.

The manager came on the phone still swearing he put the fork in. I told him I have the bags here and neither one had it in there. I was obviously very frustrated and cussing at him after that. He tried threatening me and saying he knows where I'm staying then after I dared him to come here he tells me to never call there again.  I called anyway again asking for a driver to come back and refund me my money and said I'll give the food back, they refused saying that I need to come in tomorrow morning (when I'll be in a business meeting) if I want the refund.  Just because I'm in a hotel room doesn't mean I never worked in Vegas (which I did) and know there is businesses that like to overcharge tourists (or in their case, screw the tourist).  I worked here long enough (before this meeting to know)  there is better places in town, don't go to this one just because they put the menu under your hotel room door and it claims to be the \"best pizza in Vegas\"",

    "text": "Horrible place. This was my first time ordering from this place and its my last. First it took an hour and 1/2 to get my food. The food was cold and the the order was wrong.  I ordered a meat calzone some pasta and a salad. They gave me a cheese calzone and some old and cold pasta. There excuse for a salad was some shredded lettuce and 2 tomatoes. I called before the order came to verify the order because the text they sent me said the wrong order. I called to verify the correct order and the lady said everything is correct I will make sure it's out correctly. When I called to tell them they messed up on the order she said sorry we will exchange the order it will only take another hour. So I have to wait 2 1/2 hours for a calzone. Let's hope it comes correctly this time. If your looking for a decent pizza spot around town avoid this place at all cost.",

They said it would be 45 minutes to an hour for our 1 pizza and 1 salad order. This wasn't a problem. The problem was that our pizza came 2 hours after it was ordered. My disabled husband waited out by valet. It got later and later and my husband tried to call but no answer. the shop was now closed. finally when I was about to go online to my bank to stop payment, the hotel room phone rang. the delivery guy was here but at the front desk. he didn't call like was indicated and was not at the location agreed upon. The delivery guy said he had other orders to get out before ours. once back in our room, when opening the box the pizza was cold. the salad we ordered was warm. we didn't have much of a choice in eating it since we have now waited 2 hours, we were hungry, and the pizza place is closed and won't answered their phone ( yes we tried again). the taste was good considering it was cold. if it had been hot it probably would have been spectacular. unfortunately due to the cold pizza, warm salad (that we couldn't eat) and the 2 hour wait we rated this a 1 star. I noticed a lot of good reviews for this place, and I wanted to love it too but it just didn't happen. I feel like someone forgot our order or waited to deliver our pizza on the way home. there is no reason the pizza should have been that cold and taken 2 hours unless someone flaked.",

We got a coupon under our door at the westgate hotel and decided to call for a 2 medium pizza deal for 17.99 plus taxes which was $4 and the delivery fee which was another $4. One pizza was with alfredo sauce with a bunch of toppings and one was a regular pizza with toppings. We had to go downstairs to pick up the pizza which was fine so i went to get both pizzas. Once i got to my room  I was hugely disappointed to see the white pizza completely destroyed! Both pizzas were completely undercooked and inedible. I called the manager to explain the situation and asked for a refund since they were not properly made, cooked nor handled and both completely inedible. The manager was INCREDIBLY rude yelling and cursing at me! I have never in my life talked to such an unprofessional manager ! He yelled at me telling me  to ask my mom to cook me a better pizza, I mean what business treats their customers like that!? Trust me my mom can make a better pizza blindfolded than the shit you serve and expect people to PAY FOR. Unbelievable....... After having 1 bite from the regular pizza (before realizing it was undercooked) I now have a crazy stomach ache. FROM ONE BITE. You guys deserve to be out of business completely !

All I asked was if I could pay over the phone and she gave me an attitude. I tried paying over the phone and tried to verify the order and she just cut me off and said that she already knew what my order was but I was just trying to make sure before paying. I asked for three forks and three plates and she said that the guy had already left when I had only been 20 minutes from when we first ordered After they said it would take 1hr and 45 min for them to get here and she said that he had already left which made no sense. I just think she didn't want to add one more plate and fork to the bag. When the delivery man came he gave the pizza in a big trash bag and he was very rude and demanded a tip. When I tried to sign for the payment he was very close to the door basically inside of the room demanding that we gave a tip and he checked if we gave it to her before he left. Better off going somewhere else find a McDonald's or something. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE QUALITY. Also they only gave one Parmesan and one crushed pepper for a large pizza and chicken Alfredo was bland and nasty.",

We ordered the Alfredo chicken pizza, and chicken wings, $21 in total including $2 delivery fee. It would be better if pizza had more chicken and spinach on it.  The delivery driver is friendly. When I opened the boxes, the food is still very hot! I want to give 5 star to the pizza! in my opinion, it is better than the pizzas at the buffet at Caesar Palace. I normally don't eat the edge of pizzas, but this time the edges were crispy, every slice is baked in perfection!",

When it got here the delivery driver all but begged for an extra tip. The pizza was the size of a medium, generic at best, and was barely warm, and two of the same pizzas. I called and the guy who answered made it seem like I couldn't tell I had two of the same pizzas. Then says he's going to send the same delivery driver here with the right pizza and collect the wrong one. To top it off I saw that I was charged TWICE for a delivery charge. I called them back to ask about the delivery charge and they tell me if it's more that 5 miles then it'll be extra delivery charge and maybe that's why i was charged!! Little Ceasers taste better and cost less!!! So do yourself a favor DON'T EAT HERE!!!",

I have never used them for delivery, so I wouldn't know how that service is, but coming in person at midnight has worked very well for me multiple times. The guy working there is always friendly, and brings the pizza out to my car. I actually crave their pizza just typing this review. Definitely going to stop by this weekend for an xl with Alfredo white sauce, and a bunch of toppings.  Thank you for a delicious pizza!",

I had to repeat myself again but this guy was listening to his headphone and didn't have the courtesy to take it off.He finally brought my order and to my surprise the pizza was awfully small for a medium. I kept looking at the pizza and I asked how big are the pizzas in terms of inches but the guy I asked with the headphone could not tell me. He was about to deliver an order and i asked him how big the pizza he was holding & he said it was medium. I told him that my medium was smaller, then he immediately corrected himself that it was a large & attempted to change the subject about delivery cost. At that moment, it was not worth it anymore to talk to this people. They laughed as I walked away. These people are dishonest and there internet prices are higher. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you prefer to deal with dishonest unfriendly people. I would mark zero star but survey requires at least one.",

We found a little menu in our door and thought we'd give it a shot by ordering the buffalo chicken fingers with a side of Greek fries. On the menu its listed as 10 or 6 wings for $6.99 (which doesn't make a lot of sense) but when we ordered on the phone were told it was TWELVE for $6.99, something we confirmed three times before hanging up. The food took about an hour to show up, which isn't that bad. What was bad were the fries, which were nowhere near being done. They were a wet, soggy mess and a total write off. The chicken fingers tasted like they were frozen, microwaved, then brought to us an hour later. To cap things off, this whole debacle cost $20. We asked for a couple extra ranch dips, they charged us a buck each for three of them. Then they charged us $9.99 for the chicken (even though we confirmed the $6.99 price 3 times on the phone) and $2.99 for the uncooked fries. Add the delivery charge and tip and we were left $20 poorer and still hungry 90 minutes later. Based on this experience I wouldn't dare try ordering a pizza or anything else from here.",

    "text": "I am writing this ONLY based on delivery of the veggie pizza. They have some awesome deals. Like crazy deals. 2 large pies any and all toppings for $15 or something cheap like that....that's pretty awesome for me! So, I get mushrooms, onions and pineapple. It was a winner, every single time. I am NOT kidding. The onions are grilled, not sauteed and they are soooo yummy. I make my own dough, my own sauce from fresh tomatoes and frequently make my own pizza. So, believe me, I am tough on pizza places. I like the crust and the sauce is OK. It also reheats nicely!I have really no complaints! Ok, maybe the delivery time could be a little shorter, but is it their fault I order on a Friday night sometimes?? I have ordered at 3AM (not kidding) and it's still minimum 45 minutes for delivery. But hey, at least I know what I'm getting. My cousin the carnevore get's the all meat pizza, sausage, pepporoni and meatballs and he loves it. It certainly seems to be flowing with meat. I threw that in there for you meat eaters, but veggie lovers, if they are near you, check it out. I dont speak for any other location though, just this one. And, I haven't gone in, only delivery.",

So, i just get off work at 4am and I get a sudden hankering for a slice...  So, I order online because the flyer says I can get 20% off an online order.  So, I place my order and wait about 40 min.  Just to be sure they had gotten my order, I call the number and the lady on the phone says there is no 24 hour delivery in this location.   Come to find out there are like 10 locations of this place, most of which are in Alaska and the las vegas number I called was \"dispatched\" to a call center??? in Alaska.  I don't know who runs the Vegas location, but you guys need to stop printing out False advertising!!  And of all places, the location in Vegas ISN'T 24 hours????  This is the city that never sleeps, they should be 24 hrs!!!! And their main website doesn't even have the Vegas location on there!!!   I would have loved to try the pizza here, but now i'm over it!! Ughhh   Get your information straight!!!",

Not like some busy weekend rush or dinner hour to get in the way.    The real frustration came in trying to fix the order. After calling the place three times, I was put on hold, hung up on, unable to talk to the same person twice, major communication issues, and not once offered an apology or way to fix this.  They really need to work on the customer service. Over two hours later I was left with two small pizzas totaling $ 35.  While I can't vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since I ended up with plain cheese, the service sucks.  This place just lost my business. Not worth the hassle.  I wish the best of luck to the rest of you!",

After 1.40 minutes waiting, I called them back to see where my order is, the guy on the phone was very rude, put me on hold without even saying sorry. The only sorry I heard was from the delivery guy. The delivery guy was very kind, called them and they offered discount of $5.00, but I would have paid them double the amount of the order and get it on time so my son didnt cry. Definitely not ordering from them again.",

Mary who took our order over the phone was very rude and seemed intoxicated, that should've been my first sign. But, I finished ordering my food and Mary told me it will be here in 45 minutes.  It is now 2:45 am ( an hour and a half later) and we still don't have our food so we called back. Mary answered again and told us the driver just left the store and will be there in 10 mins. 30 minutes later we call back again and we Asked Mary for a manager. Mary said \"why\" and transferred me to Jennie. Jennie said to call her back when the driver gets there to give us a discount. The driver finally gets here at 3:30 and I called Jennie 3 times and she hung up on me all three times. She finally answers when I've already paid for my cold pizza and gives us the managers number. We called the manager the next day and he threatens me over the phone, calls me a \"m*therf*cker\" and told me to never call him or the store again. I am very appalled at his response. Never order from this place ever! The food is terrible and the customer service is even worse.",

Somehow ended up with the $5 medium takeout special advertised on the window. Guess it's not a bad trade off but I don't really understand where the confusion came from and I purposely ordered slices to avoid overeating. And the crust wasn't cut all the way through so the pizza had to be torn apart. Not a fan.   Location says they're open 24/7. Employees hang out in parking lot or at entrance, slice warmer on counter is filled with old papers, and a single dine-in table. There's also a TV blaring above the register that makes it difficult to hear the other employee trying to make friendly conversation- but when his questions are how long have you lived here, do you have a job, and do you live alone, it kind of explains why all their business is delivery or takeout.   TLDR: Cheap eats 24/7, don't expect much more.",

My boyfriend was getting out of work and wanted to try something nearby.  He stopped in and ordered a carry out special $7.99.  The crust was cooked, perfectly crispy, ingredients were good but not as greasy as I'd like ( New York style). This is definitely a European style pizza baked with love. There's a slight taste of yeast which I liked. Very flavorful pizza and would probably return again when we need a late night carry out.  I was disappointed with the weird lingering aftertaste the Ricotta cheese had in the Tiramisu. Also used to Tiramisu having more soaked rum in the lady's fingers (cookie). I'm a really tough customer since I grew up eating Italian food my whole life. My boyfriend chose a Cheesecake and I did sneak a smell inside the take-out box, I think I'd go with that next time.  Overall my boyfriend said he liked the service and the gentlemen working was a good guy so he tipped him.  Excellent late night, cheap eats, munchie pizza.  I would like to try the Garlic chicken pizza next time.    SOME (not all) of the reviews should add pictures to prove how \"horrible\" it is.  How can readers tell it's bad when you don't show proof?",

I miss the call and called him back repeatedly to no avail. He took it upon himself to sell my order to someone else. Then berate me on the phone for not picking up when he called.  When I called the store they did apologized but offered no comps to offset the experience.  Based upon the other reviews of the food perhaps they did me a favor by not delivering.  Ugh. Don't use this place.",

It was dry there was only a few pieces of chicken on the actual pizza. And an absurd amount of tomatoes. The onions that were on the pizza were tiny dry and shriveled up. We ordered wings too. It's not hard to screw up wings. You cook them and toss them in sauce. The wings were dry and so gross. They looked and tasted like they were days old. Crunchy, dry, and had practically no meat on the bones. We took one look, tasted, and spit out. The food was inedible. We would not recommend! :(",

This week I placed an order, the website is different and they didn't have a selection for meatballs. I selected beef and in the NOTES section had asked for meatballs. I ordered a salad as well and asked for ranch dressing. The pizza came rather quick which surprised me. Opened the box to find I didn't have a meatball pizza, the center of the pizza was still doughy! It was flimsy and god awful. They also sent the wrong dressing. I immediately called to speak with a manager, no manager is apparently on duty or available? I was told I was getting transferred to a manager, no, I was transferred to the cook who was rude and barely spoke english. (No offense) No body bothered to read the notes I left for the cook OR the driver being as I lived in a gated community. The cook did nothing but argue. No offer of fixing the fact I wasn't satisfied with the food or that my order wasn't even completely correct. $30 plus a $5 tip out the window. I will never purchase from this place again. SAVE YOUR TIME AND EAT ELSEWHERE!!! They don't care about customer service here!",

    "text": "Ok so I won't give it a one star but Ill try one more time to figure it out.   Side note - today is my day off and normally would always go for some pizza or something so decided to try it.   White Garlic pizza - First off I am a huge fan of white garlic pizza if its done right like. either with a oil garlic blend on it. This one well not so much. The crust was super buttery I mean like if you like butter then this is your pizza for you.. I think I should of copied Philip T advise and got hammered then came in here then ordered. The cheese is ok and not sure on the dough I can't make out if its homemade or not to me it has a weird taste to it either being a PHO- Dough or real I still can't figure out.   I ordered chicken wings there more lollipop style witch I guess is the rage here.. to me its over played. Give me a high quality jumbo chicken wing over these any day. They where ok however no sauce and asked for sauce.   Also for to go or delivery you get these blue cheese and guessing ranch packets they say artificially flavored -- Its not a good practice to have these I recommend going with some other company that does not word this -- due to the fact I trashed them Its not that hard to make blue cheese or buy in -- actually Kerns blue cheese is really good and if you get that I would recommend getting some more blue cheese crumbles and combining the 2 it killer good.   Overall -- If your not drunk, high .. on life that is then this place might not be for you  Eating should be about exceptions and overcoming them especially in Vegas.    And if you think this is a hard review then its not the reason I love most of the restaurant's I have been to and seldom leave negative review's unless worthy.",

They are about 20 min from the strip so delivery times are about 50 min for dinner which seemed reasonable to me. Just as an FYI, some hotels may not let them come inside so we ended up meeting them in the lobby, which was no big deal.  We ordered online so I can't say they may have misheard us because you select the food items. And they got about half the order wrong and gave us a chicken calzone instead of a chicken parm and they gave use mozzarella bread instead of mozzarella sticks. It wasn't worth calling back and waiting for a re-delivery so we just ate what we had, the entries was pretty decent (4/5) but the deserts we got weren't as good.",

I paid $5 for a medium cheese pizza which was a little smaller than most places but I'm not complaining since it was so cheap and it tasted pretty good so I was happy. Service was average, I ordered at the store and it took about ten minutes which was fine. I would say it's better than other pizzas in the price range so I'd definitely give it a try if you want a good pizza for a cheap price instead of going to little caesars. I will be going back and probably trying some other items to see if they're any good or maybe as bad as everyone else seems to think.",

So we decided to give the place another chance and ordered an extra large pizza and an order of jalapeno poppers. Not only did we get all of 5 jalapeno poppers for $5 (you can get twice as much for that price at literally any other pizza place), but the BACON and MUSHROOM extra large pizza we ordered showed up with nothing on it but CHEESE. How do you screw up that badly? It's 9:00 at night, not that busy, we only ordered 2 things, but you STILL found a way to screw it up? I guess it's my own fault for ordering from somewhere that has 2 stars on Yelp. We'll never order from this place again. I don't know how you guys are even still in business, besides being the only place that's open 24 hours and delivers. Maybe you should hire some more people who actually care about your business and what quality of food you send out to your customers.",

Just leave your room, walk to the food court and get some over priced food. I was quoted a 45 minute delivery time. Fast forward two hours and my ice cold food was delivered. I called back to get a refund because I wouldn't feed this to my imaginary dog. Had the food been at least warm I wouldn't have complained but you can't deliver pizza that's been sitting out for two hours and expect customers to be happy. The delivery guy was super apologetic and nice but I don't have thirty bucks to spend on food for housekeeping to throw away tomorrow. Unfortunately it's been an hour since I was told the driver was coming back and I haven't heard anything so I guess I'm shit out of luck! I definitely should have Yelped first!",

On our last night we didn't feel like going to the strip and we had 10 people so we wanted to stay together to enjoy our last meal. Since this place delivered, we chose this.  We ordered 2 pizzas, 2 orders of wings and then breadsticks. They told us it was 45 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later and two phone calls later the pizza arrived. The pizza was tasteless and the chicken wings were dry and barely had any sauce on it. We realized we did not receive our breadsticks but we paid for it.   We called the pizza shop and told the woman, no apologize she just said the driver will be here with it in a few minutes. 15 minutes later, no show so we called again. The woman said it should be here in a minute and continued to argue with us. 10 minutes later still no sign of breadsticks. We called again and insisted on our money back for the poor service and less than mediocre food.   She continued to argue with us and... The breadsticks were never brought. How disappointing in their service considering they said if their services weren't up to par, we should let them know within 24 hours and they will get us a full refund or a new order. We received neither.  This places customer service was unbearable and as our last meal, we were certainly disappointed. If you're in the mood for pizza in Vegas, pick another place. I would never give them our business again.",

I often get this food delivered to me in the middle of the night...well... 2 days ago.. I decided to pick up my food instead of have it delivered.... I'm so sorry I did. Guy at the front was on his phone and picking his nose!!!!! While taking money and talking to me... SO DISGUSTED . If they do this in your face...what do they do behind closed doors?? I loved this place...now I've told every person I know about this. I've contacted the news for \"dirty dining\" ...hope they report this.",

Pizza is decent but very bad customer service, I do not recomend this place.",

    "text": "Let's see...   The 45-60 minute delivery wasn't here after 80 minutes so we called to confirm that it had left the store... the girl on the phone couldn't even find our order in the system and then suddenly said, \"Your food is on the way and will be there any minute.\" It took another 15 minutes after that.   The delivery person showed up with 2 boxes, but we had ordered 3 things. So we ask about the 3rd item and she tells us her ticket doesn't show a 3rd item. We show her our text confirmation that includes all 3 items, and she suggests we call the store. The store offered to refund the money for the missing item, and because we had already waited for so long we agreed rather than waiting even longer for them to \"rush\" it.   We get inside with our two items, open the boxes and it was so predictable... the pizza was ice cold. The cheese had hardened and the pizza was stiff on top and absolutely soggy underneath. And to top it all off, neither pizza was even remotely correct to what we had ordered. One pizza was just dough, cheese, tomato and pineapple... what the heck kind of pizza order is that? It was so far from what we had ordered it was laughable... and we would have been laughing if it hadn't been 2 hours since we had placed the original order.  Frustrating experience from start to finish. Terrible service throughout, no accountability whatsoever, and I can only assume their food is nasty based off what was delivered to us. Never again. They said they were refunding the entire order... fingers crossed we get our money back, otherwise we spent $30 to have a real crummy Friday night.  EDIT: I have updated my review to 2 stars from 1. They refunded our money and the delivery driver was sympathetic... so not the worst experience, just a pretty bad one.",

The pizza was missing toppings, and the feta wasn't melted on the fries.  It's a good thing we weren't hungry (anymore) for dessert, because the cinnamon bread was cold, stiff, and missing...cinnamon?  Woman-who-hates-her-job offered to send a replacement order, but honestly I was afraid she might ratchet on it.  I asked for the manager's info, who was super-helpful in educating me about how his people are never wrong...there was no need for him to check into into anything.  Next time, to make up for it, he says he'll make me something \"real special\", and that was pretty squicky.  \"It's OK\", I said, \"there's no reason to get back to me.\"",

Called and made the order, an hour passes by no respond so i call back to check up on it. 1st they said we werent on their order list and then after looking again changed the story to they had cancelled our order because someone showed up to our hotel room and there was no answer (highly doubt it considering the tv and everything else in the room was muted on purpose! :\\) and then yet again changed it to the cause being we called them with a different number (as if we didnt know what phone we used to call them) but they really tried making us feel like it was our fault when the error was clearly theirs.  After acknowledging this wasnt getting us anywhere & letting it go of course they realized fault was THEIRS they left a VM saying the delivery guy will be on the elevator in 5mins and we should go meet him...  Which brings me to my conclusion: would NOT recommend this place absolute waste of time and you can sense the attitude in their tone. I can see im not the 1st of many negative reviews so if they can channel that consistency of negative service into positives maybe theres still hope! (thats a BIG maybe)",

We remembered getting a flyer under a door to this place that was 24 hours and delivers. So I call and order a Chicken Parmesan Sandwich and a Meat Calzone and I'm asked for my hotel AND room number and they tell me it'll take 45 min. And I'm like, okay, cool, that's fine. Over an hour ago, we're wondering where the food is at, when I get a phone call from the delivery guy and he says he's in the lobby, waiting. And I go, what the hell! Why do you guys bother asking for the hotel and hotel room if you can't even get your ass up stairs?! I could not get up from the bed so I had my boyfriend go fetch the food. Finding him took almost 20 minutes and it turned out, he wasn't even in our building! And then my boyfriend calls and tells me he won't give up the food because he wants to make sure the card holder (me) gets the food. So my hungover, hungry and pissed off self gets up from my bed and goes to get the food. Honestly, why would you not give the food to someone who knows the card holder. I didn't understand that. My boyfriend and I head up and prepare to eat and notice the food has gone totally cold! Worst service ever! I'm surprised you guys are still in business.",

A good description of the pizza would be kinda like a pizzahut mixed with ceasers but it really reminded me of Pizza Hut the normal style that's a little thick not paper thin( they have options online to get thin if you want thin ). I love Pizza Hut and ceasers soo I thought it was awesome. Deff amazing drunk food I would imagine too. The meatballs were ok and the sauce it was in was kinda sour not bad just I prefer sweet. The icing bread thing tho I didn't like it much.  Butttt besides what I thought was good Pizza , Open 24 hours which is awesome.  Delivery only took 25-30 mins  Nothing was burnt  The delivery guy was really nice and professional  Very cheap prices as well. I order online and got 20% off. The medium pizza was only 8$ !!!  My whole entire order plus delivery charge and tax was only 16$! CHEAP and it was pretty damn good for how dirt cheap it was. You want gourmet ? You gotta pay for that. But to me this was just fine. Didn't feel like paying a fortune, was good , have no real complaint.",

Owner steals your money and tips. I even tipped the tip jar $105 to help the business. I felt bad to see that there would only be a dollar in the tip jar at most. I asked him of I could please get $10 for gas and he gives me 5 mind you I'm broke and -$200 under overdraft fees. This dude drains your cash and undervalues your pay. Not worth working here. You may as well work for mcdonalds you'll make more.",

You have been gambling or sightseeing or just running around - and maybe drinking - all day long.  You need food.  And although the front desk at Excalibur and Luxor tell you that you can't get food delivered to your room, Sicily's Pizza will definitely do that.    We ordered online  - a veggie pizza and some mozzarella sticks.  There are plenty of coupons on their website.  Our food was delivered in about 30 minutes and it was not bad.  I did call after placing the order online to confirm that YES, they would deliver to the room and not do what I've heard some Postmates or UberEats drivers will do - make you go down to valet to collect your order.    Not the best pizza I've ever had, but after a long hot day in Vegas, we were pretty glad to see 'em!",

    "text": "i'd give one star if i could to be completely honest. we're in vegas on vacation at circus circus and ordered a pizza, two orders of pasta, two salads, and a 6 pack of soda, paid about $40, ordered at 11:20am. still hadn't heard anything at 12pm so i called and asked if maybe they got lost or went to the wrong room, they said the driver just left and he's on the way. hung up, waited some more. still nothing at 12:30pm, so i called again to see if he went to the wrong room (keep in mind, it's only a 5 minute trip between the pizza place and the hotel). when i called they said the same thing, hed just left and he'll be there shortly. about 1pm he finally arrived, gave us the food and left. we open our bags and the \"extra\" alfredo sauce we ordered was ALL OVER THE BAG. the spaghetti was in the bag UPSIDE DOWN. i would understand it there wasn't a way around it but if i can do it when i bring my takeout food in from my car to my house, they can do the same. then we notice, they didn't give us any forks! called, said they'd send him back. he came back about 5 or 10 minutes later with forks and apologized. then we go to eat the food and it's super cold, like it had been sitting out for a half hour or so. if he had left when they told me, it wouldn't be that cold. the soda was also warm, but that i understand because of how hot it is in vegas. and the food wasn't even that great. the marinara sauce tastes like it came out of a packet and their \"dinner salad\" is a tiny styrofoam container with cut up lettuce and a bunch of tomato in the middle, coming with a packet of dressing. tasted a bit old. after all that, i will NEVER be ordering from here again, and anyone who asks for a recommendation on good pizza will not be hearing about this place. i've attached pictures.",

    "text": "Completely disgusted. Today, I thought I'd try something new, especially since they left me with coupons for, what seemed to be an amazing deal. Used a coupon for any 2 medium pizzas and a salad for $14.99.   Just moving here a couple months ago, I'm still in the midst of trying new things on what's good and what's not. I normally decide on going somewhere based on yelp reviews, but I was starving today and it was advertised as, \"under new management.\" So, I thought I couldn't really base my decision on old yelp reviews. Anyways, getting off topic.   Today it was 108 degrees, the inside of this place was maybe 115 degrees. That alone, was a red flag. The business had the door wide open and it was a tiny store with only one table inside, not that anyone would want to sit inside a hot store. The store front says open 24 hours, as well as a sign inside stating open 365 days a year. I assumed that they need to be open that much in order to keep their business running.   I ordered the margarita pizza, as well as meat lovers special. Let's start with the margarita pizza. It was literally a cheese pizza, with basil and tomatoes on it.. Mind you, the tomatoes were just thrown on there; not cooked or anything. As a matter of fact, when you bite into the pizza, the tomatoes are still cold.  The meat lovers pizza was nothing to love. It was a cheese pizza, with ham & sausage. I've had better pizza at Chuck E. Cheese. Of both pizzas, there was nothing worth remembering.. Even the marinara sauce was just tomato paste. No seasoning, nothing! I've had better pizza at Little Cesar's.  I could only eat about 2 slices before I was completely over it. The medium was really a small compared to other comparable places, and definitely not worth the money.   I also ordered a Caesar salad with my order. Again, nothing special. The dressing that came with it literally seems like they went to Costco or Sam's club and bought the packets in bulk. With the price of everything along with the quality of their product, it's no wonder why everything is sold so cheap. You're literally getting what you pay for!   Word to the wise, don't come here. You're better off going to Little Cesar's or Chuck E. Cheese. Same price, but better pizza. I wouldn't even serve this pizza to people I hate, and that's saying something!",

The driver should me the receipt and my number was incorrect.  I got my pizzas and I asked for cheese & peppers. Tony gave me literally 3 total small packages. I asked for more and he gave me 5 more so I had a total of 8 packages all together of cheese & peppers for my two extra large pizzas. I asked him for more and he said he's already losing money with the free pizzas, he couldn't give me more cheese & peppers.  This was the worst experience ever.",

After 45 minutes, with no sign of the food, we called and they said the driver was out for delivery and it would be there soon. Another 20 minutes goes by and no food so we call again wanting the drivers number or to cancel and the man they directed us to basically said \"there are 6 drivers out i don't know who has your food, no cancelling but he will be there in 3-10 minutes\". That makes no sense, but okay. Eventually he showed up at 1:20am, the food was cold, cinnamon sticks were hard, he said it was because there were only 2 drivers that night, but there might have been more when we originally placed our order, almost two hours before. So no, I don't recommend this place. Horrible quality and service. Just go to Denny's instead.",

We placed the order and they said 45 minutes to an hour. Around the 50 minute mark I recieve a phone call form the driver. He said I have to come down and pick it up outside our Hotel Tower entrance. He would not deliver to our room. He said he would be 5 minutes. He asked what I was wearing so he could find me. I explained what my shirt looked like and made sure he knew where he was going. Very simple, only two towers at this Hotel, two names on front of the towers. He assured me he knew, when I asked. So my Girlfriend and I proceeded downstairs and wait outside. 30 min passes and no Pizza arrives. We go to the room and call the Pizza place, and let them know what had happened. That we don't want the pizza since he was 5 min away with the pizza, now 30 min later, that pizza would be cold. The lady said that the driver just came back to the store. I thought it was over, but 10 min later i get a call from Security saying my pizza has arrived. We informed the officer of the situation and that we were not getting the pizza now. Again I thought it was over. Now 2 and a half ours later at about 2:30 am we are woken by the room phone. It was the Pizza delivery person saying our Pizza was here again. I could not believe they were trying to pass that Pizza off again to us 2 and a half hours later after we had told the store and the driver we did want this cold Pizza. Very unprofessional situation. Pure lazieness caused this situation.",

He comes back with the right order but asks for the other wings back... Lol!! Uh what? We weren't eating them anyways. But seriously ridiculous.",

The driver didn't have my pizza in a warmer when I got it. The pizza itself is hard to judge because I didn't get it hot but the sauce tasted decent. Wouldn't use this place again just because of the fact they didn't deliver a hot pizza",

Also, they've managed to MISSPELL the web address on their huge banner hanging outside the store, sending readers to a non existent site -- (this is only the beginning)  So I called the number instead and asked how much a large pizza was, I heard fumbling and then was put on hold for about 90 seconds before I received an answer. Do they not get a lot of LARGE PIZZAS ordered out of the establishment?  Without wanting to wait for another answer I just ordered the XL and was given a price. Upon arrival I handed the man a coupon, knowing full well the bewildered expression and extended fumblings this was going to result in, but that wasn't the worst part.  Also knowing that the business takes credit cards I took out my card and asked if the man would take it... \"I don't know how to work the machine.\"  long pause  \"You no have cash?\"  After borrowing the money I ate the pizza, which was fine. If you go with their cheap specials and pay cash, you'll do well, \"make it easy for them.\" You can get an inexpensive pizza at this place that's decent but due to truly absolute incompetence, get ready to work for it.",

I ordered two supreme pizzas after an hour wait for delivery the driver showed up he rang the door bell like crazy then knocked and woke up my infant daughter. The driver then didn't have change and had to run to the store to get change. After all that and a $30.00 price tag the two xlarge supreme pizzas were burnt and hardly any toppings and no cheese. I called to talk to the manager and she said she would remake the pizzas and have them delivered. I asked if she wanted me to send these pizzas back with the driver she said no that i could give them to my kids. After about half an hour the manager called me back to tell me the owner wanted to speak with me. He began by saying how he's been making pizzas for thirty years and wanted to know what was wrong with the pizzas. I proceeded to tell him how the pizzas were burnt on the bottom he then became rude and interrupted me constantly telling me that they weren't burnt because the pizzas are on a timer. He then said he wouldn't remake the pizzas because he made them personally. I explained that the manager said she was going to remake my order but him being the owner said he wouldn't then hung up on me. Las Vegas doesn't need places like this. I challenge everyone not to order from this crappy nasty pizza place. With owners and staff like this its just bad business.",

I ordered my usuals but one with stuffed crust (no extra charge because of the coupon) & one regular. If I had to choose only one word to describe the pizzas, it would be: alright. I enjoyed the taste of the cheese but it was the type that's all in one piece so it's prone to doing the pizza landslide where everything falls off in one bite.   The toppings were quality, and as Susan I. said, the ham is savory and delicious, unfortunately, the crusts didn't match up. I'm a sucker for stuffed crust from Pizza Hut where it has cheese oozing out and you can't see the other end, but this one clearly had a disappointing light at the end of it's tunnel. This crust also seemed to be thinner on the rest of the pizza so it got soggy before I even took my first bite. On the original crust, the center of the pizza was good but the crust was almost like a pizza from the freezer aisle.   The people who worked there were really welcoming and their promotions are a great bargain if you're just looking for something to fill you up.   P.S. There is now one table situated outside for those who want to dine in.",

The biggest pros for Sicily's is that it is 24 hours (I'm not 100% sure, they claim it, and I have ordered something 3am in the morning), they're a small business (yay), they deliver, and.. they always have some promotion where you can snag something from them for cheap.   Today I recall seeing two cheese slices and a soda for $4.99 which is great if you're looking for a quick meal during your lunch break. I recall a few times I've ordered a XL pizza for something around $6.99, thats crazy cheap. They pizza is also decent, medium crust, crispy,  they do not skimp out on the toppings, but you gotta eat it quick or else you'll face the dreaded soggy pizza (probably from having too many toppings). Their meat calzone is tasty, but also suffers from soggy syndrome if you wait too long.  They also serve pasta, cheesecake, buffalo wings, breadsticks, and salads.",

Then when you ask to speak to a manager they don't put you in contact with them.

I did not want to wait another hour and a half  for the correct bottle of soda before eating cold pizza.  The  hotel did not have a microwave that I could use to heat up the pizza.

Orders at 230am and arrived at 340am. That was fine with me, because it was actually a distance from my home.  I ordered a large pepperoni thin crust and \"mozzarella cheese sticks\". The pie was actually really good - bit on the cool side due to the distance but nonetheless, pretty good pie.  I would order it again.  The cheese sticks?? Not so much. Half cooked, clearly microwaved nastiness. Needless to say, I didn't eat those.  The delivery driver was friendly, the service pretty good, pizza VERY good but I would stop at that.",

I walked in to see if maybe the pizza was ready i just couldn't see it from my car but nope, pizza hadn't even begun being made, AFTER 25 minutes and no other customers in store. when the cook saw me just said oh sorry man and begun to slap the dough. he offered me a soda for having to wait but i didn't want a soda i just wanted to know why i had been waiting nearly 30 minutes for a pizza that was quoted 10 minutes. the customer should always comes first especially when there is no other customers in the store and you had promised 10 minutes. i'm not one to get mad so i was just like alright man make my pizza i'm hungry. the pizza was good but wow, i have never been somewhere and they completely forgot i placed an order or he just didn't feel like making it. i'm not sure but wasn't impressed with the service today. usually pretty easy experience coming here. never waited more than 15 minutes for a carry out. not sure what was going on but the manager should have a talk with this guy and just let him know the customer and their time is more important than whatever he had going on .",

We are impressed with their pizza as it's flavorful yet a fresh light taste... Not to mention the scrumptious crust! Addictive! It's very surprising to see the low ratings by others. We've only tried their pizza so we suggest you give it a shot! Try their classic Margarita pizza made well done. You won't regret it!",

    "text": "This was the worst food I have ever had in my entire life!!!!  The only reason I gave 1 star is because you can't give 0.  We ordered the pizza, it arrived fairly quickly so I gave the driver a tip. (He was nice) As soon as we opened the box complete disappointment. It looked like a cheap frozen pizza (Digiorno would've been wayyy better). We ordered extra pepperoni, there was barely any at all.  The wings were old, they looked as if someone else had started eating them on either side of the flats. One side had meat, the other didn't. They had no flavor either, definitely no spice. I called to tell them how disgusting and old there food is. The same lady answered the phone that took my order, when I asked for a manager she placed me on hold, then came back and said the manager wasn't in. I asked when would he/she return, today, tomorrow?? She replied \"I don't know, no one is here to talk to you\"   If you're thinking of going here, DON'T, you will be much happier with a frozen pizza, and microwaveable wings!!!!",

    "text": "I've been to many places in vegas for pizza.. but have never been able to find a great combination. Low and behold I finally have. Whoopie!  Finally a fantastic pizza place that service p, fast pizza.  We got 2 large pizza'a for 11.99. WOW! It was ready in less than 20 minutes as well. They have awesome pizza deal (carryout) and when we got there, 3 other customers were there to pick up their orders as well. There was a young guy (21), old man (50's) and another family type guy (late 30's) which is a great sign. The owner was fast, friendly and apologized for taking so long (i was like whaaaaat? not even!) You can tell they are very nice to talk to and really care about their business.  When we ate it i was surprised about how tasty it was. Totally unexpected.  Cheap being tasty? Unheard of! None greasy. Large slices. He even gave us stuffed crust for no extra charge. Super cheesy. Good amount of toppings.  Attention; dont use their website, it doesnt work. but thats not a big deal to me.. i know to others its just horrid (gasp) NOT! get over yourself.a  We also tried the mozzorella sticks... NASTY! Its just big hunks of cold cheese. YUCK! We also got the wings. They were good but not my style. Heads up wing people, they bake theirs. NOT FRIED! I took off 2 stars just for these 2 reasons.  Coming to the conclusion that this is a PIZZA ONLY place. Don't get anything else.",

    "text": "24/7 pizza delivery!!! Need I say more? I've had pizza here a few times and just revisited recently. How could I forget about this majestic hole-in-the-wall spot? I figure because I'd only get pizza after getting loaded at the PT's close by. Nonetheless, after seeing a Living Social deal for $7 for $14 worth of food, I was back on the wagon. While I remembered the pizza being delicious, I was kinda bummed that the deal excluded pizza. So I opted out for calzones. These babies were huge! Think 4 big slices of pizza with another pizza fold on top of it and you have their calzones. My man and I got 2 calzones, which was the prefect amount for the LS deal. He got the meat and I got the veggie calzone. I finished two of those deliciously cheesy and veggie stuffed pies and I was spent.   Just to be clear, this isn't a restaurant or sit down restaurant. You come, you order and you leave happy, because you just got pizza or a yummy calzone.   The guys behind the counter were super nice as well. So ultimately, if you are feigning for pizza and you're too lazy to get off your bum, call these guys! Your stomach and taste buds will thank me later.",

The service is absolute trash. Some older lady named gwenna or however the heck you spell that name couldn't comprehend a simple order of 2 medium pizzas 1 pepperoni & 1 PLAIN cheese. They took an hr to deliver my pizzas to my hotel & when I checked the pizzas they gave me 1 pepperoni & the other sausage, pep & veggies like... what???? It was a plain cheese pizza lady! I called back explaining my situation & the ma'am kept hanging up on me. Extremely rude unmannered lady. I asked for a refund & she refused so this is why I'm writing this review.  & just an FYI ma'am said my pizza is on its way & I have been waiting 1 hr & 30 mins already. Hahaha their service is just a joke.  EXACTLY THE REASON WHY THIS PLACE HAS 2 STARS. ABSOLUTE TRASH. I'm speaking about your service gwenna",

Its as skinny as my finger. I took a picture of the bbq wing so you can see how skinny it is. Second the cheese pizza is terrible, its very salty and terrible. How do you mess up a plain cheese pizza? I don't know. Next the delivery they asked for my address and I am in a hotel where their flyers are on the desks of each hotel room. When the delivery person got here they said they cant come upstairs because the hotel doesn't like that. If so then why ask for the room number. I had to basically go get the pizza and walk with all of the items back to my room. Very very terrible. If I can do half a star I would. Don't ever order from here unless you have no taste.",

I told the delivery guy we didn't order two bottles and he just gave me attitude and said: \"It's what the receipt says, it's just $3 more\".  I didn't care that it was just $3 more, my point was we did not want two Pepsi's.  Then when we called to complain the woman on the other end of the line also had a shitty attitude saying it wasn't their fault that they took the order wrong and that they're just human, mistakes happen.  They told us we could get the pizza we were missing but we would have to return the extra Pepsi and pay the remainder of the cost of the pizza plus it would take another hour to arrive.

My order from this place was a mistake to begin with; as I thought I had ordered from my FAVORITE place, Sicilis. BIG MISTAKE!!! If you want GOOD and Authentic pizza; ORDER FROM SICILIS on Twain.

I paid him and after opening the pizza everything was ice cold!  My sister called back to complain and get her money back and the lady said she would send the delivery guy back to return the money but they would need to take back.  Like are you fucking serious!?!  I kid you not, and hour and a half later the driver comes back with our money and to shamelessly take the food back.  This place deserves NO STARS!!! Save your money people.",

    "text": "Truly one of the most amazing pizza places in the city, especially for the price. But I would honestly pay double for the quality they provide. Their consistency keeps me coming back. I LOVE that they are open 24 hours, which fits with my crazy schedule, and they're nowhere near the strip where most great 24 hour places are!   The serve pizza, sandwiches, calzones, Italian desserts, etc. Pretty much the expected items at a pizza place. When you call, you do not reach the store but a call-center, that takes your order and forwards it to the store. I have had a couple experiences with a rude girl/woman on the other end while ordering, but this is the only mishap.  The pizza itself is always perfectly cooked, top and bottom, with a level of freshness that you can taste in the dough, sauce, and toppings. They even have a medium 1-topping for $5.00 carryout. Their specialty pizzas may seem expensive (one X-large is 15.99) but being creative with the deals (two X-large any way you want them) let me get two X-large specialty pizzas for $20 plus tax, making each $10.  There are only a couple chairs to wait for pizza, so don't plan a date at this place. There is nowhere to eat. Simply great pizza for carry out or delivery 24 hours.   Five stars, despite the cranky order-taker.",

I also ordered jalepenos  on my pizza and those were missing. I called to tell them about the errors on my order and they gave me the option to exchange the wings or receive free wings during my next order. I opted to exchange them and I have now been waiting about 40 minutes for my wings. They assured me that my wings would be delivered right away. I live at most five minutes from the restaurant.   The only reason I am giving them two stars is because the pizza was actually good besides the fact that I'm missing a topping. Good luck to whoever orders from them.",

They're baked, not fried. I'm fine with that. I love fried wings but I have to admit that I haven't had a baked wing I didn't like. Having said that, the quality of the chicken seemed cheap. I know chicken is chicken, but you could definitely tell a difference. They certainly weren't bad by any means but not the best I've had. The pizza? No better than what you can get at any \"chain\" pizza place. I definitely won't be back. I'd rather pay a few extra bucks and get quality New York style.",

I wasn't willing to wait that long for something that was only 2 miles away. I called to cancel and the first employee said they didn't have my order. He transferred me to the \"manager\" and she hung up on me. I called back and the \"manager\" a lady, I told her that I need to cancel my order as I would not wait two hours for my order. She asked my address and then said it was already delivered. I told her that was impossible as I only ordered it literally 2 minutes ago. She kept asking why I would want to cancel if it was already on its way. I repeated myself, I asked her to check again, gave her my information again. Then she proclaimed that I told her the wrong address. And I responded with \"of course I didn't give you the wrong address, it is my address I know it.\" She insisted I was wrong (so much for the customer is always right). She again kept asking why I was canceling, I repeated myself and then she told me to call Grubhub. I called Grubhub. A few minutes later the \"owner\" called me and asked why I canceled. I told him 1. The wait time. 2. The manager I spoke to was very rude. He harassed me with repeated questions on why I would cancel. Then said that he was an online store. Then said he was the owner of the restaurant. He was very confusing. I told him this was all too much to have food delivered, I thanked him. And again he just kept asking why I would cancel.

Pros: two italian guys cooking, prices good, food generally good  Cons: Bought the groupon, but only had online to go off of to order, online site messed up and prices/offerings are very different than the actual menu. Example: quoted $14 for a large pizza, but found out I could have got one for $7 if I had an actual menu. Prices online are more expensive than the actual cost. Pricing very sketchy.  Mushrooms on pizza clearly from a can??? Not sure.    Overall, not bad, but not good.  Especially given the 500 other pizza places to eat at in the city.",

    "text": "If I am able to give zero stars I would.     First of all the Management and delivery staff are RUDE!  The delivery guy sat in from of my office for 10 minutes with our food in his car before he came into our door.    Secondly, we ordered \"Sandwich's.\"  Their definition of a Sandwich and mine are completely different.  When it came it was a Calzone not a Sandwich. They should really tell people that their sandwichs are actually Calzones.  I do not eat Calzones.   When I called to complain the manager was rude and raised his voice.  He asked me why his delivery guy was doing in his car for 10 minutes.  I said it looked like he may have been on his phone but I don't know because I was not in his car with him.  The manager then responded with a wise remark.  The manager also decided he was done speaking with me and HUNG UP ON ME!!!!  This place is very unprofessional and really needs an attitude adjustment.    One of the ladies decided to at least try and eat what was delivered.  It is greasy and inedible.  It is nothing but dough.  I will NEVER order from them again and recommend you don't either.",

They keep telling you its on the way, the manager (if you call him) has the driver call you. who then maybe gives you the real story. There only 20 minutes away, I don't know what can take so loooonnnggg.  We ordered online for the discount. We have still not received our refund! Some discount! We are now in the process of disputing the charge.",

They were very friendly and gave a discount because it arrived later than promised. Overall, we had them delivered twice and it soaked up the alcohol well:-)  yum.",

Of course when they arrived it was wrong. Called back from my phone, got put on hold for over 20 minutes. Called from my wifes phone got right through. Caller said i'll send a new pizza. Waited 2 hours and pizza never showed. Fell asleep it was only 2 am by this point. Called back the following day and the \"manager\" said yea supreme pizza? Everything is right. (Giving me the run around) I said i'll come down there and prove it. Brought the reciept and got money thrown at me for being right. Do not order pizza or food from this place. At this point ill order from corperate places. At least i can call and they will make it right even if its under ten bucks.",

    "text": "This was the worst experience ordering. I tried ordering a few days ago and for some reason there was some issues....the manager wouldn't even answer his phone (his number was on the flyer). Today we finally got thru and were just waiting to try the pizza. We figure, it must be good if the hotel has their flyer in the room with coupons. Sadly mistaken. The pizza comes late, ice cold. I can except warm, but ice cold????? On top of that it was the wrong pizza. I call the number on the flyer, 7023338000 and they cant do anything for me. They tell me to call the manager because they're just a call center. When i call, a woman answers and says he's not available but when i tell them we have a serious problem,  he's suddenly available. This place is full of boondoggle. From management on down. I had to send the pizza back, having to prolong my wife and kids hunger. They're werent even sympathetic to that. No professionalism, horrible customer service. The manager hung up on me in the middle of my sentence. They must not honor the saying \" CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT\". No compensation for the inconvenience. This place would've gotten 0 stars if i could have.",

Order goes to call center apparently.  Ordered 2 xl pizzas, came to pickup, and they were not even started yet. Cook says my number was invalid from his records based on another customer name Adam (really uncommon name I guess)'so he decided he wasn't going to fulfill the order. They didnt even ask for a number when ordering so How incredibly dumb and lazy can he be? So had to wait while 6 hungry kids await at home (not all my kids) Pizza was average, a little dough-y and salty. Cheap yes, but Plenty of other great pizza options. Avoid.",

They were filled with something that may have been cream cheese or cottage cheese. The verdict is still out. The \"buffalo wings,\" if that's what you want to call them,  must have come from the skinniest chicken in the world. Not only were they nearly burnt beyond recognition, there was almost no meat to be found.  I had to use a toothpick to get in between the wing bones to find some meat! The cheesecake was bland and slightly gritty. And lastly, the pizza.......what does one say about this gem of the desert? One doesn't. ..it sucks.  I've never had a pizza before that tasted like someone opened up a can of Ragu sauce and threw it on a stale Bobbili shell, with stank cheese. This was probably one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. It's like they didn't even try! $30 down the drain that could have spent on getting an Uber to drive me to get some REAL food!",
