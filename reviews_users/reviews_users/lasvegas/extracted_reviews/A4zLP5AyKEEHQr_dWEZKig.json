The menu can be a little confusing, as I have never heard of a lot of the ingredients on the menu. This was resolved when the waitress explained everything on the menu very well.  Hanger steak is very good and the hummus is also great.   Decor is very relaxing and good place for social gatherings.",

Bartender Stephen asked me if it was my first time there and explained the food and the menu.  I was not real hungry so I just ordered the calms on noodles.  The broth was Saffron and lemon.  It was amazing. I had never tasted anything like it. The noodles were very good.  The clams were served in the shell and the portion was good.  Only complaint I had was that two of the clams were not cleaned well enough and had sand in them.  Ugh.  A bit off putting but it won't stop me from eating there again.  The food I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing. The people on the other side of the bar were commenting how much they were enjoying the food.  The service was great and they were very nice.  A pleasant experience.",

    "text": "OMG !! We are staying SLS and went for having dinner to Cleo. I have a 2 and half year old baby boy who has severe feeding disorders. We are struggling with it from his birth. Right now he is only eating fries. So we bought kids meal from McDonald's  next to SLS. My son didn't eat or drink anything for 20 hours and just started eating one piece of fries and we were looking out  the Cleo's menu. The waiter came to us and told us that they don't allow outside food !!!! That was new as we travelled a lot of places,eating a lots of restaurants  with my son and his food. So we asked the manager for a permission. He called the manager. Also the manager came and told the same thing to us even we explain him my sons condition. There is nothing written anyplace on that restaurant. They don't  have any  kids menu on their own. Though they give us a high chair, they don't allow him to eat !!!! No kids menu on their own!!! Really !!! What was that !!!'They said it's an law that you can't bring outside food even for babies !!!!! Really !!! My husband ask is it only for here? The manager said no it's all over. We are traveling a lot of restaurant around US and always take food we bought separately for my son.Nobody said that to us. I asked the manager what's the health reason? He replied we could get sick by outside food and say about this restaurant !!!  My husband offered the manager to sign a bond that we won't claim something like that. But well, They just make us leave the restaurant for McDonald's  Kidsmeal !!! We went to the next restaurant of SLS, north side cafe and ask them that do they have this kind of law. And they said Babies can eat anything that you brought, it doesn't matter you bought it or cook it by your own. So I really don't know that is there any law out there/exist there or I am a Asian was the reason. Or our very casual dress up was the reason. I feel so bad that I told it to SLS front desk. They said they apologize for that but they can't do anything for that because the restaurant run separately. So they offer us 50$ food and beverage voucher for an apology. Though I didn't take their voucher. We feel so horrible by Cleo's behavior that we could not even eat the food that we ordered from north side cafe. We explain Cleo my sons condition very well. I told earlier that my baby has feeding disorder and just started eating something after 20 hours  and that time Cleo make us leave the restaurant. So my son stop eating and don't eat or drink anything for that day. That's our and my sons experience with Cleo !!! Insult ! My tips for you, dress up very well to dine there other wise you will be insulted very well that you wont forget it for your whole lifetime.",

We were concerned about bringing our 8 and 11 year old kids so called ahead but they were very welcoming with the kids (kids are very good eaters and like to try everything).  This was also on a weeknight.   Cocktails were excellent.  Highlights on the dishes were the brussels sprouts, merguez flatbread, garlic shrimp and cauliflower with vadouvan and cashews. Did not feel this place was just \"good for Vegas\" like most restaurants in LV, but actually would be worth visiting in an actual authentic city.  Probably worth 4.5 stars.",

Then again, there are people who think buffets are amazing, so...  The place feels like they just re-did a cafeteria, definitely not \"A dramatic pitched roof, Moroccan tiles and chandeliers, white marble counters, and emerald-green curtains create a warm elegance.\" It's loud and whatever theme they're going for, they just succeeded in only confusing us. It's not warm, not elegant and with our table packed in among many others, we were the pinball in the machine. Bump-bump-bump. We liked our server, she was quite nice and helpful and really on the ball when a drink was mixed wrong and when we got the wrong order.  Food-wise, we liked the spicy cigars, and the kebabs were good, but all portions were one not-hungry person size. The spanakopita was so salty as to be inedible, the laffa came in a brown paper sack (so not classy) and the shwarma was little more than a mouthful. After that and two drinks for $150, it was a complete let down. We had a really good dessert at the cafe next door though.",

My boyfriend is Moroccan and this is the closest thing we have gotten to Arabic/Mediterranean food in a while. The hummus was incredible, the chicken kabob was tender and well seasoned and the lamb shwarma was delicious. The plates are very small so order about 3 each and it can all add up ... But the unique feel of the restaurant and yummy food make it a great place. The service was ok... They recommended 4 to 5 dishes... Which is way too many... And they were a bit slow... The drinks are creative but light on the alcohol... So don't expect to get too full or too tipsy at Cleo. All and all... Great food, cool atmosphere and ok service.",

She also had 3-4 additional tables.  Given the amount of people in our party, arranging a custom pre-fixe menu, and agreeing to a food & beverage minimum, one would think our party would get great service.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.   The food came out very fast, before our first drink orders.  By the time we got our first round of drinks, we were halfway done with the meal.  Even at that, they were watered down for Vegas standards.  I did not get the attention for things we needed, ie silverware, extra bread, etc. in a timely manner.  It is the little things sometimes.  The positive from this experience was that we had pre-arranged a custom pre-fixe menu.  The food was amazing, from picked vegetables to dessert.  It gives me hope that next time I visit Vegas, I will be able to give Cleo another shot but in a more intimate manner.",

Plates are expensive, even for Vegas, but the food is flavorful, cooked right, and brought to your table piping hot.  Service staff is friendly and attentive, even on a busy Saturday night.  Some of our favorites are: Lamb Shawarma (my wife loves this and normally doesn't eat lamb), garlic shrimp, chicken tagine, and their amazing Spanakopita.  Desserts are mouth watering, but the best is their bread pudding.  A great place for lunch or dinner.",

We told her we had been dying to try this place out but unfortunately had only half an hour to eat before our show started. She made sure we had some signature dishes and drinks so we could get the Cleo experience, even in such a short amount of time. The stand-outs to me were the Moussakah, Tuna Tartare & Brussel Sprouts. Dishes are small as they are mezzes but they are so delicious and extremely satisfying. The Clementina and Melon & Mezcal cocktails were HEAVENLY!! At the end of our dinner the manager came out to ask us how our experience was, which was a nice way to end our dinner. I've been to many restaurants in Vegas but this one was by far one of the most memorable. I can't wait to go back!!",

Its a great way to take friends to somewhere new and experience a different cuisine that they may not have ever tried before and not feel like they are in a very ethnic place where there is nothing they can relate to.  Many people really just relate to Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food as falafels and kebobs. But there is so much more. Much, much more.  My personal favorite is Kibbe Nayeh, which in a nutshell is a tartare. It can be made with beef or my favorite, lamb. Cleo does not disappoint with this delicacy. Just the right amount of seasoning and it transports you to another world. My one takeaway is, this is very much a tapas place. Plates are very small. A far cry from what one would expect in a \"regular\" Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurants where the food is sometimes overflowing the plate. But the best thing about the tapas style for those who are uninitiated is the small plates, to experience a little this and that. So I kinda, can get it. I'll be back soon, and maybe get 2 kibbe nayeh dishes next time.",

I had the freshly made bread (the spices were a stand out!) with hummus, fried mushrooms and -- wait for it -- the crispiest, juiciest flash-fried Brussels sprouts! No wonder these were such a hit; we kept seeing servers carrying multiple orders to various tables. I also had a hearty veggie soup, decadent falafel bites and ended up taking a watermelon frisee salad to go. I already knew this place was going to be the hit -- the second you walk in, the aroma from the bread and antipasti bar greets you with a warm welcome. (Don't go biting the air now!) I highly recommend the flash-fried Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, bread + hummus (not your typical, so don't get it twisted) and watermelon frisee salad. You'll be full, don't worry.

We ordered mushrooms, lamb kefta, lamb kabobs, shrimp kabobs, spinach & ricotta dumplings and scallops. We didn't order chicken kabobs but they comped us an order  because they were a little burnt.  My favorites were the mushrooms, spinach & ricotta dumplings and lamb kefta. The lamb kabob was dry and the scallops were undercooked.   Great ambience - lighting, music & decor.  I would go back & try them again because the mushrooms, dumplings and lamb kefta were absolutely delicious!",

We ordered Spinach & Risotto Dumplings! We ordered lamb, chicken, and steak kabobs! We ordered Lamb Shawarma!  We ordered Mushroom Flatbread!  We ordered just about everything!  The kitchen was running on all 8 cylinders. EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING that came to our table was amazing!  But for me personally, they start of the show was the lamb shawarma!  It was seasoned great, came out warm and with a sauce that just made it call come together!  It was a little overprice, like everywhere you go in a restaurant in Las Vegas, but I have been here twice already and if I could, ONLY THING I would ever come here for is the shawarma, thats just how good they are!   Now, speaking of cost, it was pricey.  Not ridiculous pricey for Las Vegas, but don't expect to get much value when it comes to price.  But do expect amazing tasting food, so to me if you're coming to Vegas, its expected.  This place is worth a trip if you're planning on going to a nice restaurant on the Last Vegas Strip!  The atmosphere is good, the lighting is dimmed, and the decor works with a name like Cleo's and their mediterranean theme they have going on.  Very clean, open and airy.  Sometimes you go to these restaurants that seems like you're going to a board meeting where the CEO is about to fire you, this is not the case! lol  How server was great! She knew the menu very well, was polite, not pushy and took great care of us!  I saw the manager roaming around checking up on the tables from a distance to ensure you was having a pleasant time.  I like that, I don't need to have the manager come to my table but its nice to see that they are alert, attentive and accessible if needed.    Located in the SLS Casino, free parking...  Overall, I can't recommend this place enough!  RUSH AND GO TRY THIS PLACE!!!",

It is a tapas style restaurant and some of the dishes are prepared right in the middle of the dining room.  My favorite dishes were:  Hummus- so nice and fresh and the bread was amazing. FYI- extra bread=$2 Borak- Puff Pastry with different kinds of cheese. So tasty and yummy delicate pasty Tuna tartare- make sure to mix everything together and eat with the chips. Sooo good!   Some Misses were: Spinach and ricotta dumpling- it is missing that X factor and lots of basil! It's okay not too flavorful  The Greek salad was a little overdressed.   We also had the beef and chicken kabobs which were good!   Overall the look and experience is something I would definitely recommend. This is a hit for SLS and I would like to try many more things.",

The restaurant itself is dimly lit and has a romantic ambiance. They play some fun Bollywood and middle eastern music which I thought was very fitting. Service was great and accommodating when we asked for a table away from the casino, but tables for 2 in the back are really close together.   My cosmopolitan-like cocktail was really good, but my boyfriend's drink was even better. We started with the pork belly and wagyu skewers which were both really yummy. The clam and noodles dish was also very good, but my favorite was the scallops. I'm a sucker for scallops, and these were delicious. I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "My partner and I had some business in the area to take care of, so we decided to go to Cleo mainly because he'd been there before with a friend, and they really enjoyed their experience.  We were seated in a booth, upon request, immediately by a curt but professional hostess. She didn't remove the extra place settings, and it was kind of awkward sitting at the table with three extra settings, but that's the old server in me. The server assistant came by with water and removed the extra settings then.  The decor wasn't my favorite. I'm not sure how the fake books across the walls are supposed to make the place feel Mediterranean. There is a strange disconnect from the bar to the restaurant, although they are in the same room.  But I was always told to not judge a book by its cover.  The server arrived quickly enough, but didn't take time to really suggest much until we promoted him to. Even then, he didn't give much explanation.  He told us he would give us a bit of time to choose. He wasn't kidding. When he finally returned, I went with my gut and ordered the lamb sliders and the potato latkes.  The server assistant was the star, though. He checked on us after he delivered the food, not the server. He made sure we had everything we needed. I believe he said his name is Horacio. Great customer service skills.  I definitely enjoyed my sliders. The lamb was cooked well, and he feta was just enough to compliment without overpowering the dish. I enjoyed the sesame slider buns, too. Great texture with the meat and the greens and veggies. The latkes were great, as well. Next time, I will ask for the tatziki on the side, because it was definitely overpowering.  We had finished long before our server dropped the check. He seemed like he was in the weeds, and didn't have time to check on us for quite awhile after taking our order.  We asked for the check, then he returned empty handed several minutes later, blaming the server assistant - whom we well know has no access to the server's checks on any point of sale system - and returned yet again, this time with the check.   On he plus side, it has taken me a bit of time to review this place, but the management staff has already reached out to my partner and has invited us back to make up for the experience.  I will definitely have to update my review then.",

I had a nice Christmas dinner here last year thanks to the manager who corrected some minor issues caused by a few staff members who seemed flustered by the busy crowd that night. I had the seasonal lamb shank and flatbread and hummus. Both were very tasty. The lamb was a pound of tender meat with a pomegranate balsamic reduction over couscous ($37). I paired it with a house red. In hindsight, it was way too much food for just me but I enjoyed it. Would return.",

I think all 3 stars can go to that. The rest weren't awful by ANY means, but there's really no \"wow\" factor.  Weird note was that we ordered draft beer and it came to us like it was completely frozen. Isn't the point of draft that it came straight from the keg and poured that way? Hubby felt his drink was flat. Still, management somehow noticed my husband's discontent and even though we said it wasn't a big deal and we didn't need a drink on the house, they still took that beer off the bill without us asking. Classy and nice!",

I wish we could have sat in front of that area instead of behind it.   We honestly had no idea what to order because everything sounded interesting and new to us. I ended up getting the Brussels sprouts, falafel and merguez flatbread. The food came out in a timely manner. The falafel was good, crispy on the outside but still fluffy on the inside; not something I would pay $10 for though. The merguez flatbread was their most popular of all the flatbreads so maybe I was expecting too much. It was light and crispy but it lacked flavor. The best part of my meal were the brussel sprouts. The slight char gave it some texture and the tangy sauce it's tossed in really topped it off.   The price of the food didn't match the flavors I had. But if you do decide to try this place out, you MUST get the brussel sprouts.",

Books along a high shelf along the entire restaurant; more Mexican architecture than anything middle eastern; odd wallpaper (like Grandma's); uncomfortable seating.  Quick ratings: =========== Food: 3.5 stars Experience: 4.5 stars Menu choices: 5.0 stars Decor: 3.0 stars Service: 3.0 stars  I tried a flurry of things: ================== 1.  Hummus & Tahini ($9) -- you may pass by the hummus because it's so commonplace and you get it at Trader Joe's all the time, but it's more than amazing.  Served with piping hot, housemade pita.  (5.0 stars)  2.  Lamb Shawarma ($18) -- probably the best of the night, but expensive.  (5.0 stars)  3.  Chicken Kebab ($10) -- nicely skewered and sliced thin, it was really good and moist.  A winner!  (4.0 stars)  4.  Grilled Octopus ($16) -- overcooked and a little fishy.  The two other people in my party didn't like it at all. (3.0 stars)  5.  Saffron Rice ($6) -- boring; common.  Pass.  (3.0 stars)  6.  Greek Salad ($12) -- good, but not great.  Not enough feta for my liking.  (3.5 stars)  7.  Brussel Sprouts ($9) -- everyone has it on their menu, but doesn't do it this good.  Shaved and roasted with capers, parsley, almonds, red wine vinaigrette, the toasted hazelnut mix is worthy.  (4.5 stars)   8.  Flt Mushrooms ($14) -- Mixed with dates, hazelnuts, puffed wild rice.  I didn't like it in Hollywood, but it was done perfectly and I adored it.  (4.5 stars)  9.  GLS Luca Red Wine ($19) -- at an enormous $19 price, it didn't cut the mustard.  Go for the Numanthia Termes Tempranillo, 2010 (Toro, Spain) for $14 instead.  In summary ========= Service was weird, nice but not professional and borderline social skill issue.  I like the Cleo at the restored Redbury Hotel on Vine in Hollywood better.",

Everything from start to finish was perfect.   The dishes come in smaller portion sizes, so our waitress recommended we order four or five things to share so we got the watermelon salad, the wood-burning oven brussel sprout hearts, the hanger steak and the sticky toffee pudding.   I can't get over how good the watermelon salad was. Light, refreshing, incredibly tasty. I could have eaten just that and left happy. (12.00)  The brussel sprouts and hanger steak were both equally as fantastic.   And finally, the sticky toffee pudding. I didn't know desert could be that wonderful. I highly recommend this dish!  Overall, the experience was close to perfection.  It definitely doesn't disappoint.",

There was a bit of wait for the food, but we had fun chatting so it didn't matter. Can't wait to go back!  Btw it appears to be the same owners as the restarant on East Flamingo and Maryland which I had eaten at several times. I wish I would have known that. I would have tried this place a lot earlier",

    "text": "My friend and I went to Cleo on our last night in Vegas; halfway through the meal, my friend said, \"I wish that we'd come here earlier in our trip so that we could have come back!!\"  Pros: - friendly and accommodating service: We were seated promptly and welcomed warmly by multiple hosts/servers--they even helped me to find a place to charge my phone. I can't eat lots of things, and our server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in offering suggestions; she provided me with a gluten-free menu and was careful to double-check with the kitchen when she wasn't sure. She reasonably recommended that we order about four or five plates for the two of us (one reviewer commented that their server tried to up-sell them, and that was not at all our experience). - \"fast food\": Even with my somewhat limited options, everything sounded so amazing that we had a difficult time deciding, so we placed an appetizer order while we tried to make up our minds. This strategy proved fruitless, as the food came out so quickly that we didn't have time to come to any decisions! Once we did place the rest of our order, the other dishes were prepared and delivered quickly as well. - delicious food: See my friend's comment above :) We ordered babaganoush, Brussels sprout hearts, tuna tartare, and lamb shawarma; I also got veggie sticks to eat the babaganoush, which comes with laffa. I'm salivating just remembering them all. --- The babaganoush was uniquely spiced and fantastic (and that's coming from someone who is very particular about babaganoush). The veggie arrangement also was stellar--great variety and bountiful!! My friend could not stop raving about (and eating) the laffa, which came out warm. --- The Brussels sprouts were SO GOOD. Order them!!! My friend thought that they were her favorite--until the tuna came out. --- The flavor combination in the tuna tartare was on point, and all of the ingredients tasted so fresh. It is presented with the tuna in the middle with the other ingredients positioned separately around the plate, and then the server offers to mix it for you. It was served with gluten-filled crackers that my friend reported also were delicious (I ate it with lettuce from the veggie platter or just with my fork!). --- The shawarma also was excellent (again, coming from someone who is particular about shawarma); the meat was cooked and spiced to perfection, and it was served with more bread, pepperoncini, tzatziki, and something else that I'm forgetting (sorry...my mental image is that it was red, in which case it probably was harissa or something else spicy and delicious), but the meat was so perfect all by itself that it really didn't need any accompaniments! My friend housed the tzatziki, though, so I assume that it, like everything else, was top notch! (I can't personally vouch for it because I can't eat dairy either.) - fair prices and portions: This is not your nightmare tapas experience of \"empty tummy, empty wallet\"; rather, the portions were wholly adequate as recommended by our server (2-3 dishes per person--we are small people but big eaters!!), and we were more than happy to pay for high quality food, service, and overall experience. In particular, the lamb shawarma seemed like a great value for the amount and quality of the meat.  Cons: - The only thing that left me scratching my head was that the chopped salad appeared on the gluten-free menu, even though it contains freekeh (wheat). I didn't ask about it (there were too many other/more creative options to get Israeli salad, which I can get anywhere), and they otherwise seemed to be extremely aware of allergen issues, so there must be a good explanation.  My friend and I both highly recommend!! This is the best (and arguably the only good) option in SLS, and it's worth the trip from anywhere on the strip!",

    "text": "Items Selected: Babaganoush  Lebaneh with Feta  Laffa Bread Kibbeh Spanakopita Falafel - Tahini, Tabouleh Mushrooms - Dates, Hazelnuts, Puffed Rice Lamb Tagine - Apricots, Silan, Couscous, Sesame Seeds Moussakah - Layered Eggplant, Bolognese, Bechamel Kale Flatbread - Creme Fraiche, Parmesan, Garlic Oil Sticky Toffee Pudding - Butterscotch, Walnut Feuilletine, Vanilla Gelato Fig & Almond Pannacotta - Amareto and Almond Brittle Small French Press - LAMill  Generally blase as it relates to Mediterranean cuisine but always hopeful for something to change my mind it was with guarded expectations that I sat down with a friend at Cleo, and although both the room and the crowd veer trendy and loud the food can best be described as bold - each of the eleven plates we experienced featuring textbook execution, beautiful presentation, and the sort of flavor profile rarely embraced in an upscale environment.  Located inside the SLS, under the gleaming guise of the Greek Pharaoh and Starck designed through-and-through, our 6:30 seating started with pleasant greetings at the podium and quickly swept away to a small two-top flanking an open kitchen the service could not have been better, drinks kept brimming throughout the evening and plates arriving in a slow, measured fashion - exactly as requested.  Beset by tagines and spice jars juxtaposing slick surfaces and sparkling chandeliers beneath a lively soundtrack that only rarely interrupted conversation our meal began with a quartet of $7 'mezzes' and with both spreads silky smooth and teaming with flavor atop pillows of Laffa the Kibbeh and creamy spinach puffs were no less special, the former balancing ground lamb to nuts and spice beneath a golden shell.  Moving next to larger plates under simplified headings like \"Vegetables\" and \"Meats\" it was with some disappointment that we were informed the coveted Duck Bastilla was unavailable but making due with four more items both the elegantly paired mushrooms and equally well conceived tagine were quite good while the still-bubbling moussakah was my favorite plate of the night.  A touch underwhelmed by crispy balls of falafel that had trouble standing up to the sauce in which they sat it was in flatbread that our savories finished and with a crisp, charred crust from the central oven likely to make any topping taste better the bitter kale amidst pools of tangy creme fraiche was wonderful, an elegant and light dish I could see playing well to the pre-club crowd heading to LiFE.  At this point approaching nine o'clock, with every seat in the space filled, our meal concluded with coffee alongside a duo of desserts and as much I liked the somewhat out-of-place pudding it was the pannacotta that stole the show - each creamy bite flooding the palate with milky-sweet tones while Amareto soaking the figs lingered at the end.  Although higher priced than the typical 'mom n' pop' or Greek festival setting, almost every single item we tasted at Cleo was reference standard, the total bill with tax and tip clocking in just under $160 for nearly three hours of great food, service, and 'scene.'  Certainly not a place for quiet conversation but definitely a spot where both the 'club' crowd or the local looking for a nice night out can be equally comfortable I commend the team at Cleo for bringing something totally new to the scene - it is original concepts like this and Yusho that The Strip really needs.",

Decor was trendy, very open compared to la's location but maybe it's because the one in la was a lot busier than this location. Servers, manager, bussers, and food runners were all very friendly and well trained. This place is all tapas so we ordered 15 plates for 5 people.  - Falafel: very crispy! It was good but I wouldn't get it again  - Bone marrow: big portion. Very tasty. Comes with mushrooms with I liked - Sauteed mushrooms: comes with a variety of different mushrooms, not sure what sauce it was but I loved it - Couscous: super fresh tasting. Great side dish  - Grilled octopus: I liked the sauce that came with it, but I wish the octopus pieces were meatier  - Beet salad: so fresh. Comes with 2 kinds of beets and avocados. I would get it again  - Lamb chops: they didn't ask how we liked it cooked so it came out medium. I'd rather have it medium rare. It was just ok - Chicken kebab: on the dry side but flavoring made up for it. And dipping sauces made it less dry - Saffron rice: what I liked about the rice was it didn't taste oily or buttery like other places  - Wagyu beef kebab: too overcooked for my liking but I like the seasoning  - Lamb roast: definitely on the chewier side but I did like this dish the best out of all the meats. It came with couscous and some sauce that went well with it   We were completely stuffed with a total of 15 plates. They recommend 2-3 plates per person and I could have finished what was left but then I would've had a belly. It was a good full for everyone.",

    "text": "I would love to give the hummus here 5 stars it's really that good!   However the 2 times I've gone though really deserves 2 stars. I would give the food 4 stars. The service though is slacking big time!!!!   The first time I went the server was very awkward and talked wayyy too much. Even went on to say something about not ordering the flatbread because it has \"way too many carbs\" under his breath. Hello I'm a normal 20 something girl, yes I like to watch my figure, but I freaking love carbs! Thank you! Ha! It also took 15 minutes to get both of my friends cocktails! This isn't even an exaggeration because a lot of the food we ordered was out by the time they got them.   As for my exact same cocktail that I ordered somehow got lost in translation. this place had barely anyone in it, I believe this was just the servers mistake at this point (no worries because everyone makes mistakes).   What takes the cake though is he tried arguing with me how I never order one when all I did was ask politely where my cocktail was. Okay, so you didn't think I ordered one, but clearly I did, don't argue, just say sorry and go and reorder or order the cocktail I requested.   There were a few other incidents with this server, I forget his name, but did not really set the tone for finer dining.   After that time I wanted to go back with my boyfriend because venues really do deserve a second chances. (Even third! Sometimes.) The second time was much much busier, after waiting 25 minutes past our reservation time we were sat at a small two top table in the front of the restaurant, wasn't exactly what we pictured, but weren't going to be picky because we just wanted a romantic night!   Some commotion started happening with the tables next to us, they looked as though they were setting up for a big party. Then a someone came to inform us that a huge bachelorette party was being seated next to us and wanted to know if we would like to move.   We agreed that this was probably best, so we were moved to the chefs counter until another table was available. As the food we ordered at our old table started coming out to the new spot, everything seemed awkward at this point, and definitely a mood killer! We just wanted to be at an actual table eating and drinking the food we ordered!  We were finally sat our [final] table and they told us they were moving our food, which they did; but somehow took a bit, and by that time most of it was cold. We were very polite the whole time, but the night just wasn't going as we'd hoped.   After the shuffle around the restaurant by multiple servers/ managers/ and hosts. We got the bill and (not saying that they have to) but not even a cocktail was taken care of for the inconvenience. Not that it was expected, but honestly it would have smoothed the experience over  for something as crazy as being moved 3 times in the middle of dinner.    It was my boyfriends first time, and needless to say he isn't as forgiving as I am, and probably will not be back.",

    "text": "Went to have dinner last night with the wife. Really good food. My True rating is 3.5  Made reservation online easily through their website. Got a table at 10:30 one hour before their closing time and the place was full. Good energy, music and we were seated promptly.  Server's greeting was friendly, asked us if this was our first time dining there and answered any questions we had.  Ordered 2 featured cocktails and the following menu items.  Oysters, Tuna tartare, Dolmades, Kibbeh, Grilled Octopus, Fish kebob, Spicy potatoes with cilantro aioli, and the Bone marrow. Finishing with fig and amaretto panacotta.  Overall the experience was good.  The good:  - Oysters were good, were topped with this lemony confite that went very well with the freshness of the oysters. - The Spicy potatoes were my favorite - The Kibbeh was really good, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Even though I did get one that included what felt like a piece of rubber band that I had to deal with unfashionably.  - Octopus was really really good! - Fish kebob  The average:  - Tuna tartare was...meh - Dolmades.... mayo? really??? I already loathe mayonaisse, but now with dolmades?  The bad:  - They were out of bone marrow which we had read many great things about. Disappointing - Last part of the service: Server was nice and professional, until she decided she wanted to go home, then she started dropping off checks in the likes of her casino coworkers, one table after another. When she reached our table to ask if wanted something else (our check in hand) we had just been served last couple of dishes. I reminded her we wanted to have dessert and when we ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake (wife is celiac) and we were told that it takes 20 minutes to be ready....along with other 2 or 3 dessert items.  Really Cleo???!  Is this True, or should we better order dessert at the beginning of our meal to be able to try the one we actually want? Maybe a heads-up at the beginning of our meal?   This is a great place to eat in Las Vegas. That is why I still gave the 4 stars instead of bringing rating down to 3. We chose a later time to eat because we had a late show to attend, and we arrived 1 hour before closing time. We ordered a decent amount of food and drinks. I believe we were a pretty good table based on my past experience as a waiter. We don't go out to eat that often, we are locals in Las Vegas so to feel that rushed at the end of our meal the moment the clock ticked closing time was very impersonal and impolite.   Will probably go back, but there are options available in town and as the buffet as SLS shows this is a crucial point for restaurants at SLS to not drop the ball with details like these. Good luck and thanks for reading.",

    "text": "If I could I'd give it a 3.9.  The food is good, it's flavorful and enjoyable. My favorite items are:  The hummus and the bread (sooooo damn good!) The grilled Octopus  The tomato & borrata salad The Lebaneh Lamb schwarma Lamb chops Kibbeh  I've tried 80% of the menu as the third time I went was with a large group and we basically ordered everything. Portions are small and meant to be shared  (tapas sizes) so it's great to go with groups and even if you go as a pair it's nice to try multiple dishes.  It's authentic Mediterranean/Middle Eastern but it's Americanized..so it's not intimidating food, even if you've never tried similar food.  The service is OKAY, they always seem too busy..in the sense that the staff can't quite keep up with the customers. The waiters and busboys are always running around like chickens w. their heads cut off. Something will always take (WAY) too long or not arrive at all, so don't be surprised. The service is ALWAYS just meh.  The atmosphere is lively, young (not like 21 yr old young but mid 20s and up but just feels good young, y'know) and fun. The music is loud and it's a good place for people watching and having drinks. It's decorated super cute and a little eclectic.  I personally don't love the SLS Vegas and feel it's a little out of the way so I don't go here that often. Also, I can't eat this type of food that often because it just doesn't wanna be friends w. my tummy, another personal reason why it's not one of my favs.   Overall, if you want a busy fun place with delicious small plates and a cool vibe hit up Cleos.",

    "text": "I had no idea what to expect going into this place, but I'm so glad we came here! Amazing mediterranean tapas! Everything we had was delicious and we were very full by the end of the dinner. We got the lebaneh, hummus, lamb shawarma, chicken tagine, Brussels sprouts leaves, mushrooms, and falafel.  We started with lebaneh and hummus-- the laffa was DELICIOUS and warm from the oven. The lebaneh with feta was so flavorful and creamy, while hummus was good, but we could have skipped it (after everything else came out, we stopped eating it in favor of the other dishes).   The lamb shawarma came next and we actually ordered a second one-- it comes wrapped in laffa and is the size of a small, overstuffed taco. The lamb was spiced perfectly and practically melted in your mouth. I added a bit of the lebaneh to half of it which was an excellent decision!  The Brussels sprouts and mushrooms (recommended by our excellent server) were so, so good. The Brussels sprouts leaves (there are two different dishes, leaves or hearts) were charred and deliciously spiced. My husband hates Brussels sprouts, but had seconds of these! The mushrooms were a little sweet and crispy, and had the consistency of caramelized chopped nuts!   The chicken tagine was deliciously tender and moist. They give you about a 4-5oz piece of meat and some had the bone, some didn't. It comes with saffron rice, which was very flavorful and mixed well with the mushrooms!  All in all, we left very full and VERY happy with our meal. Not only was the food fantastic, but the service was excellent (I wish I could remember our server's name, I think maybe Netta?). The ambiance was also very relaxed and calming, which is saying a lot for a restaurant in a casino! If we're ever in Vegas again, we'll be back!",

We came with a larger party, so 20% gratuity was automatically added to our check and totally worth it with server Janelle (think that's her name).   Our server recommended most of all the dishes we ordered and she didn't steer us wrong in any way.    Grilled octopus- tentacles and all, good texture and cooked well flash fried brussel sprout leaves- house favorite and a must try spicy cigars- deep fried, thinly rolled with flavorful marinated meat lebaneh- amazing yogurt base dip scallops- can't go wrong, tender chicken tagine- pretty display, a little bit like fried rice with a Mediterranean flavor gyro tacos- hearty tacos, awesome flavor if you're info lamb clams over noodles- the clams were nothing eventful, but I must say the noodles were addictive flat bread- oddly enough they serve it in paper bags, but it was so fresh, you'll want more  There were a few more dishes that I can't quite recall, but the experience was so worth it and we enjoyed sharing all the dishes.  Located in the swanky SLS, you can't miss this place.  I would recommend making reservations or just come when they first open to get a beautiful evening with great service and excellent food.",

We still wanted to try the Mediterranean food here enough to make the drive, and I'm soo glad we did.   We ended up ordering a few of the small tapas style dishes. All the food we tried was very good and left us wanting more.   We ordered the following items: 1. Lamb Kefta Kabab: Impossible to go wrong with this. Comes with one skewer of meat. Juicy and flavorful.  2. Spicy Cigars: Seasoned beef rolled into phyllo dough and deep fried accompanied with a yogurt type of dip. I thought these were just alright. Meat was flavorful but a little dried out. The dip was super tasty though and I realized I kept on dipping everything in it.   3. Moussakah: This little rectangle dish smelled sooo amazing!! I'm not enough of a food pro to even begin trying to explain the goodness here. Layered eggplant, bolognese and a bechamel sauce. Kinda wish there was some kind of a crunchy texture to support all the ooey gooey amazingness, but I don't wanna be greedy and mess with perfection here.   4. Brussel Sprouts: These seemed deep fried and mixed with capers and sliced almonds tossed in a vinaigrette. Great dish to share.   5. Lamb Shwarma: Teeny tiny pocket of heaven. I could eat at least 321 more of these babies.   There were sooo many other things one the menu which sounded so amazing -  BONE MARROW.... Any time i see bone marrow on a menu I get super excited. Unfortunately I didn't get to try it this time but now have something to look forward to when I visit next time!",

The food was very flavorful and it was a breath of fresh air other than your go to cookie cutter restaurants. We especially enjoyed the shrimp kebab, hangar steak, fried chicken, and dessert. They had a good selection of wine and I chose the evodia which was  a light bodied red. They had a decent amount of food to chose from but it's more of a social spot than a nice anniversary dinner place. They also failed to acknowledge our anniversary as I added it on the notes section of the reservation. Go to Cleo with your friends and share some plates but if you're looking to celebrate a special occasion, this just isn't the right place.",

We had the lebaneh with feta and laffa to start followed by a greek salad. Both were delish. For my main, I had the grilled octopus. It was so tender and tasty! I demolished it!!! My friend had the garlic shrimp and was equally pleased with her meal. All in all a very enjoyable meal. Skip Northside and come here!",

    "text": "This is a great Mediterranean restaurant! The service was superb the wait staff was very professional and fast. The lighting in ambience makes for a great dinner any night of the week or even a great lunch. I didn't realize they had a brunch until later in the week but when I'm back in Vegas I definitely will be trying it. I saw sign that said this place was \"Top 100 Hotspot Restaurant in America\"- I would completely agree with this statement. I had the Bone Marrow and it came out and looked even better than the previous photos I had seen and it tasted fantastic. This was my first time trying an item like this and I was extremely glad that I had it here first. It was tender and juicy with the balsamic reduction sauce. A slight bit of fat but that's expected with this type of item. It was perfectly balanced. I also had the pork belly, again a 1st but won't be a last. It again was tender and juicy and the small side picked vegetables was a perfect complement. So now you ask if it was so great why doesn't get five stars well truth be told you go to Vegas for really good food but on the cheap I found the Cleo was slightly pricey. For these two items to be on the appetizer menu they should've been well under $10 instead they're priced during happy hour mind you like the cost of a full meal. For those who will disagree and say it's not a fast food joint so expect to pay more. Wrong answer! I found these items for 1/3 the cost at other high end places. The Old Fashion was made to perfection!",

    "text": "I chose this place to celebrate my birthday with some friends because of the good reviews and I have to say that this place was just alright. I guess it's because I had higher expectations of the restaurant in terms of food and decor based on the price and the reviews I read.   I ordered the lamb shawarma and the chicken tagine, but was able to try some other dishes (2 types of flat-breads, falafel, brussel sprouts, and this hash brown thing with apple sauce) that my friends ordered.   My favorite dish would be the chicken tagine because the spices used with the rice was really good and it really imparted a nice fragrance for the dish. The chicken itself was good, but nothing special or memorable for me personally. This was one of the few dishes where I can see the price being justified at $18-19. I was also surprised at how good the brussel sprouts were! I expected it to be plain, but it was quite delicious and flavorful.   I was kind of irked that my lamb shawarma had this tough piece in it (I couldn't chew it). I think it was cartilage, but I didn't look at it since it was already in my mouth and it would have been pretty rude to just place it on my plate lol. If someone is going to pay $9-10 for a small dish, I would expect it to be pretty darn good. Flavor-wise it was good, but I wasn't amazed.   The falafel was really crispy on the outside which was nice, but once you bit into it, there inside was pretty bland. That was really anti-climatic for me because I have had falafels before at school events, and despite being soggy, they at least had more flavor on the inside.   Overall, I would not recommend this place unless you are in the area and had a strong craving for Mediterranean food (and are lazy to drive to another place). I would take the other reviews with a grain of salt because I would say this place is a typical Vegas restaurant with overpriced menu items, which for the most part are moderate in terms of flavor and quality. There are some delicious dishes, but it just sucks that the majority is just not up to par with the prices you have to pay for them.",

We then split a toffee pudding for dessert and then we had to walk all the way back to our hotel down the strip.

    "text": "Cleo stood out when I was looking for a nicer somewhat more upscale dinning place for a fast birthday dinner. We made a reservation through open table for 645 for two, and when we got there the place was pretty empty.   The hostess is the reason why I gave this place a 4 star, there were probably 4 tables taken in the restaurant and she sat us right by the entrance in a small table. When we asked for a table towards the back for more privacy she gave us the unwilling look, and the other employee saw her and gave her that same face back like \"they are one of those customers type of looks\".   The server recommended about 4-5 dishes to share for two people.   We got the babaganoush with the pita bread, calamari and Brussel sprouts to start. The pita bread is fresh out of oven very soft and chewy, definitely one of the best pita breads I have had.   The calamari was delicious too, the sauce goes great with the calamari.  It is a must try. Brussel sprouts is my favorite food already, the way they fried the sprouts really brought out the flavor and the texture of it.  The second round we got the moussakah,  wagyu beef and chicken kabob, the chicken kabob was ok, but the beef one was very tender and juicy.  If I had to pick a favorite it would be the sprouts and least favorite would be the moussakah, it was baked and tasted very creamy.   The dessert was fig and almond panacotta. The figs we got were dried figs, weren't  fresh like shown in some of the pictures on here, but the panacotta itself was delicious.  The GM also stopped by personally to check on us. Great food place to check out if you want quick upscale food",

We were presented with a special vegan menu with 8 items. We ordered 7 of them. The flash fried Brussel Sprouts knocked my tiny little under amor socks out into the casino. The hummus was bomb. The eggplant looked like some retirement home shit. The falafel balls reminded me of cake pops. A mushroom dish of unknown origin arrived. Pretty sure it was compliments of the chef, but Randall paid for it anyway because he's a fucking moron. I consumed two drinks. The Cucumber Smash and the Get Smashed.

Instead of ordering one entree per person, you order several dishes between your group and share everything, which gives you a much better idea of the menu as you go through your dining journey. The brussel sprouts came incredibly recommended by our server, and if you're not a fan I beg you try them here. They're crisp and full of flavor and reminiscent of salt and vinegar chips! The roasted lamb is also noteworthy - the most tender, juicy lamb I've ever eaten. And the Moroccan fried chicken was so crisp and light and the apricot mustard that came on the side was so sweet and tangy and to die for. We came for a birthday, and they surprised us with the lightest most delicious toffee pudding cake for our celebration. And on top of everything, I was so surprised how small our check was once we'd finished. Between four people, we spent just more than $100 when we were anticipating so much more - it is absolutely worth every penny. The service was incredible, prompt, and so friendly. We came at a slower hour, but don't hesitate to make reservations if you're unsure. Cleo is definitely a stop you want to make while you stay in Vegas.",

If you order the dips or hummus, the flatbread comes with it.   Meatball Tagine ($13) - comes with about 6 meatballs? Nothing special, but meatballs in a bowl of tomatoe sauce. It was good, but not worth ordering.  Lamb Shawarma - lamb skewer which was slow roasted with spices. It was very delicious and flavorful! Must try!  Grilled Octopus - with celery, potatoe, lemon vinaigrette - just medium cooked and flavorly  Garlic shrimp with gigante beans, castelvetrano, and preserved lemon - one of my favorite dish! Probably comes with about 12 shrimps. Not your typical garlic shrimp, the sauce and the seasoning was different, but very good.   Quinoa and roasted vegetable salad with spiced almond and cumin - Good salad, but portion is small.   Denison sausage - not too salty and the order comes with one sausage that you can cut up.   Overall, this mediterrean restaurant has a balance of flavor (not overwhelming with seasoning like most mediterreanean food). Each dish is about $10 to $15 which could be shared. I enjoy sampling the variety of diffferent dishes. It doesnt seem like a lot of food, but it was filling.",

    "text": "After the craziness of the rock n roll las vegas 5k, my friend suggested Cleo in the SLS, which was just across from the race course.  We made reservations prior and were seated after checking in.   Ambiance was nice, a sense of adventure with books and globes stacked along the ceiling walls.  Feels as if we were exploring an old mysterious passageway in Egypt and a booby trap can be activated at any time...  Food was amazing, strong flavors and characteristics: - hummus with bread:  bread was warm, soft, and delicious.  came in a paper bag, which was very clever and fun. -burrata and heirloom tomatoes:  so simple yet so tasty.  tomatoes were perfectly riped and sweet with the creaminess of the burrata.  topped with arugula for some bittiness.     -chicken kabob: super moist and tender chicken breast on a metal skewer -mushroom: very earthy and a tad sweet with great textures.  the mushrooms were meaty and delicious.  the pop came from the rice puffs and chopped hazelnuts.  -scallops: packed with flavors for such a simple scallop.  scallops were not overcooked.  sat on a bed of red pepper paste and topped with frisee salad and capers. -roasted lamb with couscous and yogurt: the least favorite dish of the night, but was still decent.  lamb was a bit bland and not as tender as I expected.  It was a bit too dry, since there was no sauce on it.  the thick yogurt on the bottom did not help with the moisture but gave it a creamy tart flavor.  couscous was pretty bland. -sticky toffee pudding with walnut brittle:  soft cake with crunchy brittle, creamy vanilla ice cream, and side of caramel sauce.  good way to end the meal.  service lacked some smiles and comfort, but with good company and food, I can brush that aside.  overall great food, ambiance and company.  definitely worth a trek away from the main strip of las vegas to the SLS for cleo.",

    "text": "I know the star rating was 4.5 at the time I went but I really did not believe that I would be following suit.  Located in the SLS right on the casino floor and getting a table right at the front I thought I would hate this experience because of seating location.  The good thing I guess was casino was empty and the table game right there did not have anyone playing.  The host sat us down and I asked her what does she like, she said the lamb hawarma but cautioned it is small...in my head in like it is tapas place mostly everything is small.   The waiter came by and mentioned to use the tasting menu is a great way to go. I think there were two options one for 65pp or 45pp.  It looked good but I wanted freedom to try whatever would wanted so we passed.  He also mentioned the lamb  shawarma as his favorite item so we got that, falafel, 3 kebabs (2 chicken, pork belly) with saffron rice, mushroom Flatbread.  Falafel was mainly for the wife because I only like it one particular place in NY.   Kebabs were great. Chicken came still on the skewers and the pork belly was just on the place. Pork Belly was my 2nd favorite item. The top had a nice crunch and under had a great meat to fat ratio that created juicy gelatin explosion of flavor in my mouth. I really enjoy the rice too.   The lamb shawarma was small. The moist, flavorful lamb fill to the max in a tiny pita (that sounds funny).  S*** this was so good, amazingly good, the level of goodness can't really be described. This was literally one of the best things I have ever eaten in life. I could order 3 of these and just have it as a meal and be completely satisfied, probably have a heart attack when I was finished though.  This is a must have item imo if you visit Cleo.    The Flatbread came last and at this point we were pretty full and I was lamb shawarma drunk so I really don't remember the taste of it.   We had a very cocktails that were made nicely as well.  Wait staff was great on service and being attentive to us. One thing that did annoy me though was the uniform of the ladies on the wait staff.  The women wore these open bow tie with their white shirts...it looks disheveled.  Hopefully it can survive the horrible location that the SLS currently has when more projects are completed up north",

    "text": "Went to Cleo for my birthday last week and honestly had the greatest time. Service was top notch and the food was sooooo delicious.   We all decided to do the $45 tasting menu which was served family style and they definitely did not skimp on food for our group. There was more than enough for everyone and I'm a big boy.   First, the hummus. Super delicious, full of flavor and we opted for the yogurt and cucumbers as well which was a smart choice. Lots and lots of hot, fresh bed to indulge with.   Second, the cauliflower. I don't think I've ever tasted a vegetable that was so damn tasty. It was cooked perfectly, with a little hint of cumin. Definitely suggest it!  The garlic shrimp and hanger steak was next. Steak was tasty, but the shrimp is cray. Lots of flavor just don't plan on macking on your date afterwards because it's full of garlic flavor.   Chopped salad was unlike any salad I've had before. Super tasty.   Lastly, the desert. Sticky. Toffee. Pudding. Definitely ended the dinner on a delicious sweet note.   What was very impressive was that they split the bill for 13 of us with ease, which you don't find to be easy at a restaurant of this caliber. If the tasting menu is not available I would still recommend any of the items listed. You will not be disappointed!!",

Darkly lit room..makes Cleo the perfect spot for date night, although they are happy to accommodate large parties!

I was a little skeptical about it, but I will say that everything was very delicious and well done. Our server was a tad bit too casual for my taste (I have a bit of an issue when servers sit down next to me to take my order), but she was very personable, friendly, and checked on us often.  The decor was very sexy, and would be perfect for a date night. Just dim enough to feel romantic, and very sophisticated.   We ordered: Garlic Shrimp, Grilled Octopus, Hanger Steak, and a lamb dish whose name escapes me. They were all delicious and perfectly cooked. Our cocktails ($14) were also delicious. Now, 4 dishes between 2 people totaled just under $100, which did sting a little bit.. You're not going to be full, especially if you go and you're very hungry. But if you're not starving, you'll be pretty satisfied.  A solid choice.",

Firstly, the ambiance here is so adorable. From the chandeliers to the silverware, everything in this restaurant gave me a warm Aladdin-esque feel. We were seated in a little private section with drapes all around to give it an essence of seclusion.  We were a group of 5 girls and stuck to the mezzes. We had to order two rounds of the grilled octopus topped with fennel with a garlic cream sauce.. it was outstanding! Just enough of a smokey taste but it was still soft inside. We also ordered two plates of the brussel sprouts. They were a bit on the oily side but I loved how they were decomposed and shaved, which gave it more of a crunch and flakiness after they were baked/fried. We had the falafel, beet salad, lamb and chicken kebab, hummus, chicken liver, and the Turkish salad. We loved every bite of every plate.  Keep in mind, the plates are small and they are all family style. They bring the food as its made, so they come out individually.  For dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding with Turkish coffee. The coffee is made with sugar, which would have been nice to have known prior to ordering. Regardless, it was a decent shot of coffee. The toffee pudding was good but not memorable.  The service was quick and friendly. All of the waiters had a smile on their face and were eager to fill our glasses with water. I am glad I tried this restaurant and am looking forward to trying their other location in Los Angeles!",

Cleo was good- we shared the wonderful spicy potatoes with cilantro, the flavorful chicken kebabs, the roast lamb which was very tender, and raw oysters. We had the bakhlave and the hot apple cinnamon tart with vanilla gelato. Servers were really helpful. One craft beer and one riesling later we paid about $128.00. We liked the ambience although the location means the music from the casino area pushes its way in. All in all a very enjoyable meal!",

    "text": "I had two friends staying at the SLS so once it came to dinner time we walked around looking for a place to eat. Because it was late and in the middle of the week most places were closed so we settled on Cleo and I am very happy we did! This place was a wonderful surprise. I have to say I wasn't expecting much which is probably what made the experience even that much better. The variety and quality of the small plates was wonderful.   By far, my favorite dish was the lamb tartar. I had never had lamb tartar before so I don't have anything to compare it to but it really blew me away and I have been telling people about it ever since. The three of us ordered a number of small plates because we wanted to try it all. What really stands out to me (aside from the lamb tartar) was the pork belly, falafel, brussels sprouts. and definitely the grilled octopus. I am always hesitant ordering octopus, even though it's one of my favorite foods, because of the way some places cook it. Cleo served a perfectly tender octopus dish that definitely surpassed my expectations.   Not expecting much from this place I was pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to try it again with my now high expectations.",

    "text": "Great food, strange atmosphere and slow service and WAY off the beaten path.  I love small plate dining, and the selection and tastes did not disapoint. Everything was delish. The atmosphere of the dining room is odd. felt more like a cafeteria than a fine dining establishmnet. Lots of tables located too close to one another. Also the place was too lit up and bright in my opinion. It was obvious our waitress was new, took a while to come around and take drink orders and did not seem she had knowledge of many of the items on the menu. Also there was no timing to the spacing of the course we ordered. Our first course of small plates came out there there was a 15 minute gap after we were done with our first plates before the second plates came out. Then once the second round arrived we were not more than one or two bites in before our third course hit the table.   Summary: All in all the food quality was great, Cleo had only been open a couple weeks so maybe they were just working through some kinks. Straighten out the atmosphere of the dining room and train your servers a little better and this could be a 5-star experience.",

My guest and I waited at our table for a few min before the server greeted us. Her name was Jessica. Few min go by and she returns with our water, having to make a second trip for the lemon we requested with our water.  By now, my guest and I realize how careless our server is.  So she takes our order and our food come out in a timely manner. Food was phenomenal!!! Especially the spicy cigars. But the lamb shawarma was by far the best I've ever tasted! Highly recommend the shawarma.   I would've been happy to give five stars to Cleo if the service wasn't so terrible.  Our server had us waiting on her! So irritating. It was an hour before closing time, there was one other table in our section and we waited more than a few min for our server to cash out our check.  I would like to go back and give this place another chance, but next time I'll know who to avoid waiting on me.",

It is a contemporary tapas style, Mediterranean cuisine with seasonal shared plates, mezzes, and flatbreads. Dishes are fresh, flavorful and beautifully presented. The menu accommodates all kinds of eating restrictions such as, kosher style, gluten free, vegan, etc. There honestly isn't one bad dish on the menu.   The restaurant has a selection of handcrafted cocktails and unique wine that are pretty spectacular. I recommend trying Lotus Flower and Mediterranean Margarita. As for dishes, The Hummus, Brussels Sprouts, Hazelnut Mushrooms and Grilled Haloumi Salad are some of my favorites. The Merguez Flatbread, Prawns with garlic, dumplings is also recommendable.   Happy Dinning!",

I am salivating at the thought of the meals we had here several weeks ago...  The tapa style experience allows you to not fully commit to just enjoying solely one meal, but rather sharing many flavors with the company of others.  I recommend getting in-house bread - I later wished that I had asked for some to-go - alongside some of the dips. I enjoyed the hummus, babaganoush, and shawarma the most. The shawarma was extremely flavorful and not really intended for sharing (unless you are okay with sharing a bite). I was extremely pleased with it.  For dessert, at the recommendation of our waitress, we enjoyed a creme brulee. I encourage you to do the same when you visit.",

I was greeted for my 6:00 reservation by the manager Spencer at the host stand. He took us to our table and made some really good recommendations for us that we defiantly ordered. When the manager says something is good you usually get it. Spencer started us with some water while our server Jessica (I believe her name was, super sweet blonde) started us off with some great wine. We told her we like new Zealand Sauvignon blancs and she paired us with two amazing wines according to our flavor profile.  My meal was over the top amazing. The best part about this place is that it's Tapas style but the portions are hearty and actually filling compared to other places.  Cucumber dip- great starter with their warm bread they serve. The dip has cucumbers and dill in it. Just spread in on the bread and it's a perfect starter(4/5)  Spinach and Ricotta Dumpling-  not your normal \"pan fried dumpling\" these babies are soft and prepared for over 4 days just to be perfect. Literally melts in your mouth. Served over a pesto sauce that was amazing!!!! (5/5)  The garlic shrimp- I literally have this all the time. It's my favorite dish. (5/5) just get it if you love shrimp.  We had so much food that wasn't mentioned, the thought of dessert scared me I might have popped.  I truly want to thank Spencer, Jessica and even the busser staff for making my experience memorable. We felt welcomed, and super appreciated. Everyone gave us attention and that's how you put on an optimal 5 star dining experience. I'll be back...AGAIN cleo!",

The other standout for me was the brussel sprouts. Wow crispy slightly spicy flavored just perfectly an amazing addition to any meal here!

Greeted graciously by the hostess and seated within a few minutes started our night off right. We were greeted soon after by our server who took our drink orders and suggested a few items as well as how many plates he thought would suffice since our party was a bit larger. Everything is served tapas style and meant to be shared by the table. We ended up ordering about 18 plates (some the same but multiple orders).  Our drinks came and very soon after our food started to arrive, one right after the other. The pace of the food was super fast. From a group who likes to sit and enjoy the food, while ordering mutiple drinks...we only had time to really drink one drink. That's how fast the food came out. Honestly, for a nicer restaurant if they paced the delivery of the food better, patrons would be permitted the time to order more drinks. Which would increase the overall check. Also it would allow people to actually enjoy the food vs scarfing it down.  The food itself was pretty good. I definitely recommend the brussel sprouts, lamb chops, bone marrow (heads up it is very fatty and oily, but good) and shishito peppers.  The various types of hummus they offer are worth a try too because the bread they give along with it is delicious!  Now to be fair, I have never had Mediterranean food before so I don't have much else to compare to but the cost seemed really high for the little amount of food you received.   Our sever was really friendly and personable however so he made our overall experience pleasant.",

It was a Mediterranean restaurant with pop music playing, it felt a bit awkward and out of place.  The service was great as the food showed up when it was ready. The highlight was their house bread which is freshly baked in their oven! We got many courses, the non meat came in abundance. Most of the meat beside the octopus were fairly small portions which was a bit disappointing ( reason for 4 stars and not higher).  Most of the food was flavourful and cooked really well. There was a lot of variety so the tasting menu was great !   My favourites were the octopus, cigars, the lamb, and the bread. I'm a huge meat lover as you can see.  The desert in the end was amazing as well. We got one flourless chocolate cake (it was like a lava cake with melted chocolate inside) and the coffee cake. We really enjoyed both the deserts!  Overall great place and experience.",

Ambiance: Mediterranean-semi casual (casual if you're looking for a date night)  beautiful decor, comfortable seating throughout.   Seating: good for small parties of two up to large parties. Indoor seating only (this place is in a casino)  Service: Excellent!!! Glasses were always full, empty plates were cleaned off immediately. Table was professionally cleared off for each course.   Menu: a scrumptious selection of Mediterranean inspired dishes. Mouth watering and cooked to perfection. My husband and I ordered all the happy hour small plates and we were NOT disappointed!!!  Snag a glass of wine, your BFF and grab a comfy seat, but make sure you bring your appetite too! If you're a foodie like me, you'll have a hard time picking just one dish to sink your teeth into.",

I love being able to sample so many things on a menu- especially when it's all so delicious. Definitely give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "If you are craving some Mediterranean food and are tired of the same old food that you'd find on the strip, Cleo is a great alternative. The dishes are reminiscent of tapas style dishes. I only ordered two dishes, but I could have easily eaten a couple more.   To start, I had a glass of their Duval on tap, which is a Belgian beer. It was really crisp and delicious. I ordered their Wagyu Beef Skewer as recommended by a manager. It was quite very tender and tantalizing to the tongue. At this moment, I realized that I probably should have ordered their combination of kebabs with rice because it was that good, but another dish that seemed to be touted by their manager was their grilled octopus. Apparently, this particular dish was featured in Las Vegas weekly recently. However, I was truly disappointed in their grilled octopus. Although the presentation was quite nice with its variation of color, the octopus was cold and lacked texture and taste. The octopus was bland.  Overall, the dining experience was excellent. I was somewhat envious of the large family that sat in the communal table at the front of the restaurant. It is a great area for a large group to gather, something to keep in mind for my next visit.",

The interior of the casino looks a bit industrial (lacking ambiance), and the restaurant looks right into it, but otherwise, atmosphere was good. Our server was awesome, attentive, informative. We ordered maybe 1-2 dishes too many - the server recommended 3/p.   Carrot Harissa (added veggie sticks)- really yummy, creamy. Waiter actually gave me the ingredients for it. Chopped salad - refreshing, tasty - but had a lot left Falafel - Yummy, moist, but the Tahini was SUPER salty - I would avoid or have them put on side instead of bottom of plate. Tasted like I was sucking on a salt cube.  Mushrooms - this dish was ok, a bit sweet with the balsamic cartelized (I think) and didn't 'wow' me. Lamb Tagine - loved this dish. Apricots were a very nice touch. Grilled Octopus - delicious. What really blew my mind was the shaved celery...yep, it was that good.   I would recommend & would most likely return.",

We ordered everything family-style so we could taste a bit of everything on the menu (spoiler alert: it's all delicious and I definitely recommend coming with a group to do the same). We ordered:   -The bread and dips (to die for) -Shishito peppers -Brussels sprouts (some of the best I've ever had... and I'm coming from L.A., where it's virtually impossible to find a restaurant that DOESN'T serve brussels, so that's saying a lot) -Kebabs (we ordered 3 different meats; the wagyu [beef] stole the show--they marinate it in Pepsi!) -Tuna tartare -Moussaka (stellar!) -Lamb (mouthwatering, comes with a delicious sauce over couscous with raisins/currants) -Grilled octopus (cooked to perfection) -Mushroom flatbread (flavor and texture like WOAH) -... and an embarrassingly wide selection of desserts (*cough, get the fig one and the apple one and the baklava one, cough cough*).  So yeah... basically a food dream.  Also worth mentioning: the waitstaff and restaurant manager were accommodating AF (and let's just say one of my party members is, ahem, particularly difficult to please) and really made for an incredible dining experience overall.   If you're in Vegas, definitely make it a point to eat at Cleo. I honestly would relive my entire business trip just to eat here again!",

Probably the best restaurant I've ever been to in Vegas. The service was excellent, we got lucky and had a really nice private table near the front that closed off.   It can add up to being expensive. One tip, drink the tap water. The fizzy stuff is $9 per person. The drink specialties are expensive too. With water and drinks we had spend $90 before we even met our waiter.   It was a few weeks ago I was there. Unfortunately I can't remember the specific plates that we love, but 3-4 of them completely blew us away. I would go back to Cleo in a heartbeat if I was in town.",

    "text": "We stayed at the SLS over Christmas this year and I decided Cleo would be where we would enjoy Christmas dinner. I made reservations the morning of through Open Table and while all time slots showed as still available, was beyond pleased later, that we had done so.  We checked in with a bit of hassle, primarily because the restaurant opens directly on to the casino floor and there was only one hostess. We had to wait an additional 20 mins for our table and found it very awkward as we essentially were taking up a walkway around the casino floor.  We were seated at a table for two in the back of the restaurant. We enjoyed the decor and the cooking station in the center of the restaurant is a nice feature. I had read through the menu online and so already knew what to order. My husband wasn't familiar with Mediterranean food and so I nicely got ordering control after outlining dishes to him. The alcohol menu didn't match what we were looking for and so I ordered just a lemongrass lemonade after seeing it listed in a cocktail. This turned out to be a $7 drink, so watch out for that.  We started with the cucumber and yogurt (tzatziki essentially), spicy potatoes, and chicken kebab. The orders were nicely spaced out and we loved everything. The fresh pita was amazing as well, though served a bit too hot to touch. For an entree, we split the grilled hangar steak. This took about 20 minutes after our mezze's to come out, which was a bit irritating, but overall worth the wait. The steak was very tender and I liked the spoon salad. We added on a side of the pickles and I was very pleased with the fact that they were instead spicy pickled carrots, celery, and various colours of cauliflower, instead of cucumber.   Service was very good, though spotty at times, and we also had a buser exclusively for our table, who was excellent. Our water glasses were never empty and we never had a used dish on our table. That was excellent to see after some of the earlier Yelp reviews, that they needed to work on this.  Per our SLS stay, we had a $40 resort credit to use, which left us actually owing very little. This has been our favorite Vegas meal since coming together for 5 years and I definitely can't wait to come back. It has also allowed me to cook some of these dishes at home without a nose turn-up. Success!",

When our waitress greeted our table we hoped that this time we would have a better experience, as it was the same server we had in my previous review... Well once again we had an awkward experience every time she returned to the table... I understand that this is a \"tapa\" style restaurant, and if we were still hungry and wanted more food, we would order more food. Can I recommend not to ask your table 5 times if they want to order more food when they've already said they're fine??? The guests that we brought to dinner were getting very irritated as she continued to interrupt our conversation attempting to push more food on us. I felt like we were being stalked by a car salesman trying to meet a quota. I hope next time we come in \"Nessa\" (I think her name was) is not our server.",

We are staying at the Sls and know this restaurant to have good food. It's Tuesday, so not a busy night. We called ahead, and then walked down to the restaurant. The hostess seated us at a table literally next to the casino. The rest of the restaurant was practically empty. We politely asked to be moved further back into the restaurant so we didn't have to hear the slot machines etc. she moved us to a nice table, and our group sat down.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  There were maybe 5 tables that had patrons sitting at them.  No water, no greeting, no server.  At one point the manager walked out, glanced over, and kept walking away.  After about 20 minutes we got up and left. Not a single server or manager or hostess said a word.   We had to say something to the manager, he tried to get us to stay. Too little and way too late.  We are happily enjoying milos at the Cosmo now!",

The restaurant is beautifully appointed and the service was quite good.  We decided to share a few dishes tapas style and enjoyed everything - the scallops, brussels sprouts, grilled halloumi salad and the lamb kefta.  The extensive menu offers a little something for everyone and I love how you can try so many different tastes during your dinner.",

The drink menu was crafted with care and a specialty cocktail I had there with muddled green grapes was exceptional. We tried first a trio of dips the bread fresh from the oven in its little paper bag was warm and adorable. The hummus, some sort of taziki-ish dip and a carrot dip was all excellent and could've been a meal all by itself. Then the spicy cigars which are a delicately rolled egg roll type meat stick of delight. These are to die for and I could have definitely eaten like 20. Then the lamb on a plate with pearl couscous was one of the most tender and delicious things I've ever put in my mouth. This coming from someone who usually doesn't order lamb because normally I think it can be a bit 'gamey'. This was not in any way. I love the different plate patterns that come out looks like lots of different China patterns and therein tradition of breaking the plates was a happy surprise as there was a bride to be in our restaurant who got to throw a plate down and everyone yelled 'OPAH!' That was exciting! We sadly had no room for the dessert but would gladly go back anytime. We had attentive staff and even met one of the general managers who was very pleasant. Bartenders were amazing at making memorable and unique drinks.",

I definitely recommend both dishes. I also splurged on dessert and ordered the sticky toffee pudding, this too was spot on. Not super sweet,  just the perfect end to my meal.

Pork Belly - crisp on the exterior with just the right amount of seasoning - tender & juicy. Lamb Shawarma - Not gamey, tender and seasoned with a hint of curry. Grilled Octopus - Celery, potatoes and lemon vinaigrette. Bomb so tender! Clam & Noodle - Awesome finishing tapas - generous portion and so delish.   Fig & Almond Pannacotta - OMG, HAPPY ENDING!

Regardless I made my way here last night. I wasn't as satisfied as I thought I would be. The waitress recommended the Lebaneh over the Hummus but we ended up ordering both. The hummus tasted water down or someone didn't drain the garbanzo beans well enough before they top off our dip or so it seemed. The Lebaneh was okay it had a strong sour taste but I feel as if that comes with Mediterranean dishes. My friend wasn't so pleased by that. The laffa that came with it was so cold. I would've preferred it to be at least warm if not hot. We ordered an additional 3 skewers 2 shrimp and 1 steak wagyu and it was mediocre. I felt like it was a home made dish. The steak wasn't seasoned much at all and tasted bland. The shrimp was okay I mean it didn't have that Mediterranean kick I was looking for I guess. Okay I'm saving the best for last.... the Brussels sprouts. They were the only hit at our table!! They was sooo flavorful, crunchy and simply delicious!!! I highly recommend them even if you don't like brussel sprouts. Let me honest not everyone does. Don't miss out on them though and you will thank me later. I tried to look over the dessert menu but nothing stood out. I am give it another try later if I'm in the area to try the rest of the menu and see if I can get Mediterranean cuisine taste they offer. They do have a great happy hour deal I posted in my pictures and the prices are really generous!   Side note, I took some take out for the fam and I managed to try a lamb chop from their order and it was delicious but it did lack flavor and seasoning. Thank heaven for salt and pepper?!",

    "text": "Middle Eastern food on the strip!  SLS players club offered $30 off of $60 during my birthday month so that made it a clear choice on a recent Monday night.  It was packed at 8:30pm with quite a few people waiting outside.  I'd suggest making a reservation.  Being the middle ground between casual eateries at the resort (Umami) and high end (Bazaar Meat) makes it easy to see why Cleo is so popular.  The menu offered a lot to ponder over, but my mind was already set on one thing....falafel!  It's not easy to find a good version of those deep fried balls of chickpea/fava bean heaven around these parts, but the ones they're serving up here are falawesome.  The light crunch of the exterior went into delicious, warm legume center that was well spiced.  My only regret was not ordering the side of hummus since the amount that arrived with the plate wasn't even enough for three balls let alone seven.    A minor complaint was that while six of the balls were dark green on the inside, one was very pale green.  It didn't taste much different...still... can you imagine if Robert DeNiro's character from the film \"Casino\" saw this?  He would have ripped the chef a new one and then made sure he personally saw to every falafel that came out of the kitchen!    \"Kibbeh Nayyeh\": chopped raw lamb accompanied with mint, bulgar and lebaneh, was my wife's favorite dish.  It was unlike any other tartare I'd ever had.  The creaminess of the lebaneh (Lebanese yogurt cheese) blended so well with the meat and the toasted parmesan crackers to spread it on.  I found the shawarma portion to be very small for $8 and would definitely pay more for a full lamb entree or just get kebabs instead.  The moussaka was below average and we didn't even bother finishing it before ordering the impressively rich and decadent sticky toffee dessert.    There are plenty of other menu items worth checking out on a repeat visit like grilled octopus, flatbreads, and multiple mezzes.  I don't plan on being a stranger.",

Wagyu Kebob: Tender, flavorful and mildly sweet. It comes with a slightly spicy tomato dip. 4.5/5  Falafel: These were excellent. Comes with tabbouleh. Warm and grainy just the way they should be. 5/5  Lamb Shawarma: The lamb slices were cooked until they have crispness to them. The lamb's slight saltiness was balanced by the mildly tart tahini. This is small (hint: tapas). 4/5  Brussels Sprouts: Citrusy vinaigrette with hazelnuts. The Brussels sprouts were crunchy. 4/5  Squid and Rice: Slices of squid with rice with squid ink and saffron. The squid wasn't rubbery. 4/5  Pork Belly: Crisp on the outside but fatty, tender and juicy inside. Great flavor. It comes with a sna cup of pickled veggies. 5/5  Garlic Shrimp: Peeled shrimps with lots of garlic. I wish I asked for bread to dip in to the sauce with. 5/5  Moussaka: The Greek eggplant \"lasagna\". Careful how much cheese you get or it can get real salty. Rich, creamy, delicious! 5/5  Bone Marrow: Glazed and served with mushrooms and grilled warm buttery bread. The marrow just spreads so easily onto the bread. Hello, clogged arteries! Sinful! 5/5  Almond and Fig Panna Cotta: I've gotten so bored with pannacotta. But this has nice flavor and texture combinations. The syrup and crunchy figs add excitement to the rather blah and predictable creaminess of pannacotta. 4.5/5  The servers, table runners and the chefs behind the kitchen were all outstanding. Excellent service. The manager was going around to make sure diners were enjoying their meal and experience. Mom would've loved this place.  Also, if you love Moroccan mint tea, get their iced tea. So good!",

    "text": "One of the three fine dining establishments at SLS hotel. This one is exotic, more affordable with decent portioned dishes for a tapa style restaurant.   I have never had Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food, I've always thought it was all meats, turned out there were lots of veggie and seafood dishes, the menu is extensive with many choices for everybody! We skipped mezees and flatbreads, not in mood for lots of carbs that evening, went for some protein and veggie dishes, along with a specialty cocktail and Perrier champagne.   Our tapas: Rice ball soup, Brussel sprouts, Grilled Branzino, Alaskan salmon fish kebab, Wagyu kebab, Grilled octopus and Grilled hanger steak.  I wanted the Seafood tagine so bad, but they didn't have it that evening, was a little bummed.   First time tried kebab, I was impressed, the salmon fish was not hard and chewy at all for a skewer! Very tender inside, so flavorful outside, the hot sauce was bomb, I used it on everything! Hubby's Wagyu beef kebab was very tender and soft too, wow...how did they do that!   Since they didn't have Seafood tagine, so I tried other seafood. Branzino was kind of light with crispy skin, I liked it. Our waitress recommended the grilled octopus, said it was a very popular dish. The octopus was extremely tender and flavorful, probably one of the best I have ever had for a very long time, but I hated the sour cream underneath, I didn't like the creamy stuff in all the dishes, but I guess that's just how Middle Eastern food is. Overall I liked the salmon kebab the most among all the seafood we tried.   Brussel sprouts worked for both of us, I had most of it, loved it. Hubby had a rice ball soup, I suppose it was a huge rice ball in chicken broth? He liked the soup, left out the rice ball. The hanger steak was so tender and flavorful, perfect in medium rare, hubby loved it with rice. The Middle Eastern style rice looked so dry, tasted even drier, can't say I liked it too much, guess it's just great to go with meats.  The food portions were so big for tapas, our waitress suggested us ordering quite a few to share, I even kept a menu just in case. Turned out we barely finished all our food, no room for dessert, the flavors were so rich, we got full so fast, or we were just not used to Middle Eastern food, yet....   My specialty cocktail Lotus flower was a very weak vodka drink, I didn't like it too much, hubby's Perrier was very tasty of course.   Our waitress was not very attentive from time to time, it was a very slow dinner, I don't think they had enough servers at the moment, that's weird for a Saturday night.   I have yet been to the Cleo in Hollywood, think I will give it a try soon, I got curious about Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food since this meal, very exotic flavors, very interesting, I love fish kebab!",

    "text": "Decided to try the Cleo here for dinner. My husband mentioned they got good ratings here so we headed off the strip to check this place out.  Walking in everyone greeted us politely. Very friendly. We just had buffet that morning and wasnt pleased so we were hoping dinner would be better. Turns out it was.  I understand that they served tapas here but its a tad bit expensive. You definitely get what you pay.  Lamb Shawarma: super good. The meat just melts in your mouth. Im not a huge fan of lamb but this restaurant has turned me into one   Venison Sausage: this is my first time trying anything venison. My husband told me before its very chalky or grainy when hes had it previously. But the sausage here was amazingly delicious. No complaints and I'd have it again if it was offered. I cant describe the taste of it but it was definitely worth trying.  Bone Marrow: honestly this is also my first time having Bone Marrow. Technically Ive had it at a buffet before but this tops it off. I love how buttery and fatty the taste came out. So far im convinced anything ordered here will meet anyones expectations.  Last order is the specialty mushroom flat bread. Since we had ordered all small plates I was worried my husband and I were still hungry.  So we decided to order the flat bread which actually filled us up. Very delicious and full of flavor. The plates seemed small but it was actually a lot. The bill at the end came out to about 73 bucks. Totally worth it for the two of us.",

The server up-sold us to order 3-4 plates per person and we knew better... we ended up with 2 plates per person and still had tons of foods left over.  I ordered the flat bread and it was yummy. There were also other flatbreads ordered, bone marrow and some sort of chicken as well.  It's super romantic inside and yet we found it a little TOO dark to see our food.  Everything was very tasty and we felt super cool while there... Just be careful if you're planning on dancing the night away as many of these foods can be rich and heavy - aka hard to feel sexy after lol!",

The star was definitely the octopus! So meaty, tender with amazing char smokey flavor. The lamb was moist and the brussel sprouts were terrific, crispy bits of heaven. We also had a nice bottle of wine and a dessert wine.  Our waiters were awesome! They brought out a nice cake for my birthday and our server Walter sang me happy birthday. He had a great voice! Our other server, Manuel, was very attentive and had good suggestions. When they were out of the dessert wine we requested he gave us another option and discounted it. Plus he gave us the last bit of the one we did request at no cost. They did so many little things to make a wonderful dinner experience.  Now we need to go back and try so many other of the interesting options on their menu.",

    "text": "Cleo is a tapas style Middle Eastern restaurant inside of the new hotel SLS. The ambiance is quite nice. Not to dark, but also not too bright as well.  I came here with a party of 3 including me. The wait was around 30 minutes on a Saturday night. Not too bad. We were seated in a huge booth. The seating arrangement was kind of awkward since the table was huge.  I'm a fan of Mediterranean food so I had pretty high expectations for this place. We ordered the following dishes to share.  Babaganoush that came with warm lavash bread. The babaganoush was extremely disappointing for me. It had a kind of sour taste to it. It tasted nothing like other babaganoush's that I've tried. However, the lavash bread was amazing. Soft and warm like it just came out of the oven. It was so good, that I had to order another one just to eat by itself. I don't need a dip for a bread this good....  We also order the falafels which were pretty amazing. These were probably my favorite dish of the night.  Other dishes we tried were shrimp kabob, lamb shank, bone marrow, and octopus. Everything was just okay. However my boyfriend really enjoyed the lamb shank. He said it was probably one of the best he's ever had. Our friend was really disappointed with the bone marrow and said that it also had some kind of weird sour taste to it. The octopus was good and tender.   Overall, for the price, I think I wouldn't come back here for Mediterranean food. There's so many other places in CA that has authentic and good Mediterranean food for 1/2 the price.",

Since they knew it was our anniversary,  it would have been nice to be seated at one of the lovely empty booths rather than a small table.  Service was prompt and friendly.   Pricey for a nearly vegetarian meal for 2 with no alcohol  - over $100.  Highlights:  potato latkes, fried brussel sprout leaves, harira soup and the only non-vegetarian choice - the scallops.  All  delicious!  Very disappointed with the house pickles - carrots, celery and cauliflower.   For $5, we would have liked more creativity.   No sweet white wine options.   Spicy potatoes good.  Grilled halloumi salad just okay. Dessert was fig & almond panacotta and flourless chocolate cake.  Both were nice. I appreciated being able to order a decaffeinated cappuccino.   Again, ambiance and service excellent and we really enjoyed ourselves.   We would love to come back often but will have to remain a place for special occasions.",

    "text": "Wonderful, WONDERFUL meal at Cleo mediterranean tapas inside the new SLS Las Vegas Hotel and Casino (old Sahara).   We wanted to experience the new place as soon as possible, so we secured a reservation at opening time, 5:30 PM Sunday, 8/24. Our waiter was awesome: funny, without being too fake-chummy or cloying. He took a few minutes to explain the menu and sold us immediately on Lebaneh with Feta, a very creamy, almost cream-cheesy dip with wood-fired bread seasoned with garlic and zatar. Addictive, sour, spicy - everything wonderful to start the meal!  I ordered fried brussel sprouts hearts with piquillo peppers, hazlenuts, and preserved lemon as a second starter. What a wonderful explosion of tart, garclicky, salty flavors. I already love brussels sprouts, but this was heaven! My partner ordered dolmades (grape leaves stuffed wtih lemony rice and lamb). The waiter accidentally delivered 2 orders, and comped the extra one. Already starting to see that one of the \"Ss\" in SLS certainly must stand for servicel!  My partner ordered a chicken tagine, redolent of aromatic cinnamon, preserved lemon, pichouline olives, and chicken thighs. I ordered a meatball tagine with charred tomato/piquillo pepper sauce and a soft egg in the middle. So wonderful: rich and decadent. I have a picture of it that I would like to include with this review, but it's my first time posting on Yelp! (this meal most definitely inspired me), so I apologize profusely if I can't figure out how to upload pics!  By the time we were finished with our main meal, we were both far too stuffed to have anything else, but our wonderful waiter talked us into a dessert to share: molten chocolate flourless cake with vanilla bean gelato and super-ripe banana. What a wonderful, light desert! Best part of the evening came after we waited for what seemed like quite awhile to receive the cake. Eventually, the house manager came to our table, apologize about the wait for the cake, explained that ours had already been prepared, but the kitchen wasn't happy with the quailty of the result, so they cooked us a new one. The manager offered to comp something else while we waited. I had a divine Turkish coffee served in a wonderful little copper pot. Also while we were waiting, our waiter comped us with a little appetizer-sized desert (toffee chocolate bar).  Do yourself a favor and go. This was by far the best meal we've had in Vegas - anywhere (and we've bowed at the altars of Honey Salt and Lotus of Siam)!",

We were a bit upset but already went into it knowing that it was a brand new restaurant and it was the first Saturday night of they're opening! Once we got seated we immediately got greeted by the manager and he apologized for our wait and gave us two free bottles of champagne for the inconvenience (was there with 7 girls so we were all super happy for that gesture and totally was surprised/thankful)! Now to get to the food... Mann oo man we had about 6 different appetizers and non of us could decide which appetizer was the best because all the food was phenomenal! The food is tapas style and comes out as it's ready so threw out the entire dinner we all raved about the amazing food! Service was unbelievable especially since it's a brand new restaurant, in a good way :)! Each time a server passed our table they topped off our water cups, took done plates and kept making sure we were all doing good! I could go on and on how great this place is! Must check it out :)",

The bill came to $298 after tax and tip.  Shockingly, I discovered that we were even charged for water, which was poured from an already-opened bottle and tasted like the Vegas tap water.  The biggest hits at our table seemed to be the lamb dishes, the freshly baked flat bread, and the wine.  I enjoyed my meal immensely, and the service was friendly, talkative and very responsive.  However, I wouldn't recommend Cleo and I doubt I would go back because of the steep price. Everything we ordered on the menu was wonderful, it was just overpriced--even for the Vegas strip.",

    "text": "Cleo serves the best Mediterranean food I have ever tasted, hands down. The experience is certainly one of the highlights from our recent Las Vegas trip.  The portion size is smaller than typical American restaurants and the dishes do not come with any sides or add-ons. We ordered two appetizers from their Mezzes section: 'choice of dip with laffa' (we chose hummus with tahini as the dip), and 'from the oven' (Brussel sprout hearts, hazelnuts, and Fresno chili). For the main course, we tried the 'pick three kebab' combination platter: lamb kefta, chicken kebab, and shrimp kebab. The amount of food was just about right for a table for two.  Each of these items had a distinct touch of the chef that keeps them apart from the other restaurants we tried. The ambiance fits well with the lobby of SLS Las Vegas. Food price is justified to the flavor they come in. We would definitely pay a re-visit to try out the other items on their menu the next time we go to Vegas.",

    "text": "This was such a lovely meal. Mediterranean is a go-to for me, and this certainly didn't disappoint.  When we arrived, the hostess seemed to be assisting staff elsewhere, but we were quickly greeted and seated. We had no reservation, but still managed a great seat. The service was friendly all around, and we didn't have to wait too long to order or for our food to arrive.   My partner and I shared the \"Summer Menu\" which consisted of a single/shared order from the \"First,\" \"Second,\" and \"Third\" courses of the meal. We each ordered our own \"Fourth/main\" dish and we each got our own \"Fifth/dessert.\" The price for this was $50 per person. I am somewhat confused how this works out economically when one person orders compares to two people, but it worked out, I guess.  For our shared dishes, we  had the Hummus with Laffa bread, the Quinoa & Roasted Veggies salad, and the Brussel Sprouts. The hummus was smooth and tasty, topped with creamy tahini. The salad was decent with lots of yummy veggies. The Brussel Sprouts and salad were a tad bit salty for my taste buds though.    My main dish was the Hanger Steak cooked medium. It was very flavorful and super filling. Definitely one of the better Hanger Steaks I have had. My partner had the Grilled Branzino and it was cooked perfectly (maybe a little salty for me).   We each ordered separated desserts. The Sticky Toffee pudding was rich and extremely sweet, and the Flourless Chocolate Cake was sweet as well with oozing chocolate insides.  All in all, this was a great meal in a cute, fancy setting. I am curious about the Happy Hour for next time.",

The greek salad was bland, no flavor, also tried the clam noodle, and that was a nightmare of a dish, along with the chicken tagine which was well undercooked. I think the kitchen staff needs to spend a week or 2 near the Mediterranean sea and try some of the real Greek and middle eastern  countries' dishes as this place has no business being open serving this type of food. Maybe we were there a night the staff was off duty, not sure.",

Came here for my birthday dinner recently and it did not dissapoint!  **Food/drinks: 5 stars I forgot the name of the cocktail but it was bright yellow and citrusy! Very good. And lotssss of  H20 because it's vegas and you must stay hydrated! Horitiaki salad -- yum! a bit of a twist on the classic presentation but same great appearance Babaganoush -- not too smoky, comes with a well seasoned flatbread Kale Flatbread -- parmesan, light hint of garlic, one of my favorite dishes Baby Kale salad with grilled greek cheese -- very good, has hazelnuts and citrus! Felafel - 7 of them, a bit dry but flavorful inside, with tachini and tabouli, it came out last and I was too full by then so I only had 1. We could have done without this one.  **Experience/Service: 5 stars Service was personable, not rushed and very helpful. She recommended 2-3 dishes per person and we got 5 things, but they're pretty large portions so we could have gotten just 4 and been fine.  **Ambiance: 5 stars Nested inside the SLS hotel (which has a lot of good restaurants by the way!), the ambiance was so beautiful. Books and old antiques all over with ancient writings and beautiful old tattered mirrors lines the walls. I like how the fire pit oven for flatbreads was visible from anywhere in the restaurant.",

It was suggested for the four of us that we order 8 or 9 entrees, we ordered 11 and were stuffed. Very loud even on a Tuesday evening after 7.  I've had better chicken and lamb kefta kabobs, I'm not a fan of falafel balls before we walked in and these did not change my feelings. The salads we had were wonderful as was the spanakopita and the baba ganoush, hummus and labni. However, the portions of the baba ganoush hummus and labni were the serving size I've gotten as \"included with\" a dish from the many middle-eastern restaurants I have been to and they did not cost us $10 a plate or the 3 for $28. These were great, but the price was over the moon, as was everything. Vegus prices I guess. The fresh flat bread in brown paper bags was good. The brussel sprouts were also excellent.  Cocktails were great at $15 each. I had 2 Market Mojitos and they were unusual and good.  Put this on your bucket list and go for the food and the experience.",

The hostess is very inviting and informative with all menu options, explaining everything even before you're taken to your seat.  It was the perfect week to decide to dine here because they had their Dine LV menu available which was an amazing 5 course meal option for $40.   First Course (Appetizer) - LABANEH WITH FETA  `If you like greek yogurt and tart flavors with well blended spices this is definitely the better choice over the hummus. The laffa has it's own spices as well and it is even delicious on its own.  Second Course - BEETS SALAD `If you have never had beets before, this is a good way to begin your introduction to them. The beets and avocado slices are topped with a pomegranate vinaigrette of some sort. There's some tang/ citrus that mask the dullness of what you anticipate a beet to taste like. Absolutely delicious combination! Once I finished, I immediately began brainstorming ways to integrate it into my routine meal prep rotations.  Third Course - BRUSSELS SPROUTS `It's crispy, it's tender, and it's fresh! How is this possible? Well, it's flashed fried! The leaves on the Brussels sprouts are all separated (by machine, not by hand as that would take intense manual labor haha!) and then quickly fried at high temperatures and immediately therefore after brought to your table. Ahhhh you could just eat this and eat this and not feel guilty because it's just so light and crispy! I even want to come back just to have a big bowl of this stuff!  Fourth Course - GRILLED HANGER STEAK ` THIS IS A MUST! I ordered this without realizing I didn't disclose how I wanted my steak cooked. I was pleasantly surprised when it was brought to me media rare (just how I like it). I would suggest if you like it any other way, to mention something at the time of ordering your meal because they do not ask you as they would at any typical restaurant. The hanger is accompanied with small grilled potatoes (about bite size) and a little \"spoon salad\" but I just used that to dip the potatoes in because they were a little on the bland side. However, the meat was soft, juicy, and very flavorful. Not once did I think to ask for pepper or salt to season.  Fifth Course (Dessert) - Flourless chocolate cake with Ecuadorian Arriba chocolate and a scoop of vanilla gelato. `OMGAWWWWDD the warm flourless chocolate cake just oozes melted Ecuadorian chocolate as you spoon into it. The fact that it's flourless makes you feel less guilty with every bite you continue to take till it completely disappears into your stomach! The vanilla gelato is great to balance out the palate with the rich flavors of chocolate.",

The happy hour was voted the best in Las Vegas by Food and Wine, and I completely understand. We ordered crispy brussel sprouts with a delightful vinaigrette. One reviewer said the portion was skimpy, and I absolutely disagree. We ordered lamb schwarma, and it was tender and flavorful. We ordered babaganoush; one of us is gluten free, so the waitress offered to bring fresh veggies to eat the dip. The veggies were plentiful and included much more than the usual carrots and celery. Those staples were there along with zucchini too. Delicious indeed! We also ordered the flatbread during the Social Hour. It was so big that we had to take some back to the hotel room and enjoy it later. Two of us split four tapas and the market mojito (flavorful and refreshing), and we left completely satisfied. We had a late reservation for Bazaar Meat (another restaurant in the hotel), and we had to cancel because we were still full from Cleo's. It cost us approx $40 total plus a hefty tip for one of the best waitresses we've ever encountered. See the pics I posted for food, ambiance, and drink. We will return...again and again! Hope to try Bazaar Meat sometime soon too!",

    "text": "The only time I'd been to Cleo was not long after SLS opened, when Elites were treated to an overnight stay, dinner tastings and drinks at Umami, Cleo, and Katsuya, drinks in the Lounge, then admission to the club with bottle service, and breakfast the next morning at the fabulous coffee shop that closed soon after.  It was a never-ending Dionysian/Bacchanalian feast that has yet to be matched.  Oh, those were the Elite days!  But this visit was strictly for dinner, and with a $30 birthday comp in hand, we bravely set out for the restaurant after a great comedy show at the Smith Center.  We didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant wasn't crowded, so we were seated right away at a large table.  I wasn't blown away by the wine list, so I ordered a Mediterranean Margarita - tequila with fig puree and lime.  It was heavy on the tequila, so I had to ask for more of the fig stuff to moderate the alcohol.  Probably a problem only for me :)  We shared a Harisa soup, which the kitchen put into two bowls, so we didn't have to keep passing the bowl back and forth.  I loved it:  just the right amount of spice, lots of chickpeas and other veggies in a thin tomato-based broth.    An order of falafel followed - 7 balls on dollops of hummus, with a small center mound of a couscous/tabbouleh combo.  The falafel were delicious, but slightly dry, so they could have benefited from a little more hummus.  What I don't get is that if all these small plates are meant to be shared, why have an uneven number?  You can't divide 7 by anything!!  For our main courses, my husband had chicken tagine and I ordered lamb tagine.  Our waitress said they were the largest of all the main dishes, but they really were quite small.  Enough for me, of course, especially after the soup and two falafel (along with a helping of the delicious bread that we had to ask for).  Hubby didn't expect dark meat and a bone to deal with, but he forgot to ask.  He liked it, but didn't love it.  My lamb was a bit fatty and light on the apricots, but with the generous portion of fluffy couscous, it was a good dish nonetheless.  Very good service and a delightful atmosphere, but the Strip prices don't make for a great deal without that birthday comp.  Still, a nice place to go for a special dinner.",

Food - it's all small plates / tapas family style here which works well.   Hummus with tahini with bread/veggies - hummus was tasty and not too paste-like. The bread was warm, soft, and fresh which went great with the hummus. The veggies were crisp and fresh.   Wagyu kebab - 50/50. Half of the meat was tender and soft while the other half was just too chewy. Flavor was good though.   Chicken kebab - it was good but the same as any chicken kebab I've had in the past.   Watermelon and feta with avocado, spiced nuts, and cucumbers salad - probably our favorite of the night! Super flavorful and very refreshing. Couldn't get enough.   Mushrooms with dates, hazelnuts, puffed rice - if you like mushrooms then this is the dish for you. The puffed rice adds nice crunch.   The special - lamb shank cooked over 10 hours falling off the bone with pomegranate glaze served over bed of lentils.  - the meat was literally falling off the bone. Super tender and tasty. Fills you up as it is a heavy decadent dish.   Sticky toffee pudding - butterscotch, walnut feuilletine, vanilla gelato - nice way to end the meal. The middle was hot and soft which went well with the gelato on top. Not too sweet. Satisfying.",

It is a Mediterranean themed restaurant that serves entrees and tapas plates.  We had a party of about 15 so we opted to get our own meals per couple.  I got the lamb shwarma pita and it was absolutely delicious!! The plate was also massive and gave me about 12 ounces of meat.  I left stuffed!!    The starters I got were spicy potatoes with cilantro:  These were oven cooked in a semi spicy oil and served with aioli and of course Hummas w/ Tahini Sauce:  The flat bread it was served with was delicious and the hummus was great too.    The rest of the table seemed very please with their meals as well.  I will probably be back here at some point.",

    "text": "Monday was Industry Night here at Cleo, and it's the first one yet.  Maybe our server thought she wouldn't be tipped because my table of 6 felt ignored.   It took at least 20 minutes for her to greet the table, and from there another half hour to get the pita bread down (with the most amazing taziki sauce I've ever had- so I ordered more). From there the food flowed pretty well.   Borack wash DELISH ... Some sort of cheese filled crossaint ... You can't go wrong with that.  Taziki was phenomenal  Chef Ty is extremely slow (we had a nice view of his station and it was a bit painful.. Quinoa salad is really good There's a drink called Adriatic Fresh - get one... In fact, get three.  After he finally came around, The busser - Nick- was the best part of our experience. Super friendly and just plain awesome. I don't know where he was during the first 30 minutes of our meal but other bussers would come and pick up one thing, or nothing at all. At one point my friend piled dishes on the seat next to her, and I had some on the table stacked, hoping someone would clear it. The food runners should really be picking things up that are overcrowding the table so they can make room for the new items, our runner must've notice how much unused dish ware we had because she told us a busser would be over soon. Note she didn't take a single thing off of the table.  They need to really work on keeping tables bussed and unused items out of the way. Maybe throughout the meal drop new share plates...   It's unfortunate that almost a month after opening this place is still dis functional.   At one point I saw what looked like a customer (because she was in street clothes and holding a purse I assumed she was a customer) completely rip into a food runner. I couldn't tell what was going on but it happened on the floor in front of guests, management, staff... It was so awkward. After making out what she was saying she must've been a manager. It's extremely inappropriate to speak to your staff the way that woman did and esp on the floor! Take it to the back! Poor girl.   Regardless, the food was wonderful and the staff seemed happy. Smiles are contagious.  You'll get it guys! Keep up the positive attitudes!",

Cleo is a tapas style restaurant.  All the dishes are in small portions, yet sharable.  If you have an appetite, make sure to order more than plate!  But here's a tip, order a few plates at a time to keep the food hot and fresh.  The dishes come out pretty quick, so don't worry about not having food on the table.  What's awesome is the oven they have that pumps out hot fresh breads.  To start, I really recommend the Hummus.  I tried many of the dishes and all of them were superb!  I would also say the pork belly and the kebabs are all worth trying.   On a busy wknd, make sure to have reservations!",

    "text": "This was my last night staying at the brand new SLS Las Vegas and I wanted to eat at one of the hotel's \"signature\" restaurants. Tapas seemed like a really \"LA\" thing to eat but Bazaar Meat was booked solid so I made a reservation for Cleo on the TV in the hotel room (nice touch) for 5:30pm, right when they opened. I arrived right at 5:30 on the dot and was seated promptly after the restaurant staff yelled \"Opah!\" in the back signalling open time I assume.  There was a server who saw my California t-shirt and asked if I was from NorCal, and I said, nope, SoCal. He was disgusted. In my head I was like \"Eww, NorCal? Get the hella outta here!\" Anyway, all in good fun.  A guy named Chad was my server and he was pretty upbeat and knowledgeable about the menu except for a little confusion on the Honey Citrus Sidecar on their cocktail menu. It says on the printed menu there's crushed mint in it (which I hate) but thankfully, just a misprint! The cocktail was oh so great with the honey, yuzu and Cointreau really setting off the Bulleit.  The SLS has restaurant menus on the TVs in the room too so I already knew what I wanted to order! After looking through a few reviews for the Hollywood outpost of Cleo, I settled on the Hummus, Falafel and Meatball Tagine. I don't have a very sophisticated palette so I didn't want to go too crazy on flavor profiles so I settled on things that looked familiar to me.  The hummus came out first with housemade Laffa bread that comes out of the brick oven piping hot in their signature paper bag. The hummus comes garnished with whole chickpeas and olive oil. It was fantastic and I couldn't stop ripping off more bread trying to sop up every last bit of it. The texture of the chickpeas helped to break up the smoothness of the hummus so it was a welcome addition.  Halfway through the hummus dish the falafel came out and was a great complement. I usually have falafel on pita bread with hummus so this was perfect. I ripped off a piece of laffa, spread some hummus on it and topped it with a piece of falafel. It was glorious. I could see how someone who was just having the falafel plate would need some sort of sauce or complementary item. The falafel itself comes topped with a garnish of onion on top of some tahini.  I thought I could handle two small plates but it was too much for one person so Chad was nice enough to start a to-go bag for me and wrapped it up before my meatball tagine came out! He was really attentive (I guess I was the first person inside so that kinda makes sense) and the busser regularly refilled my water.  When the meatball tagine came out I thought I could fit no more but when the server opened the lid, I knew I had SOME room. There were eight relatively small meatballs in a tomato sauce surrounding the softest cooked egg ever! I gently poked a hole in the yolk and started dipping the meatballs in. The creaminess and richness of the yolk were a welcome contrast to the tender meatballs. I really loved the presentation in the clay pot as well. I finished half of it and the busser packed the rest of it up (I think his name sounded something like Orozco).  All in all, it was a great experience, the service was great, the food and drink was great and the value was OK (I hate paying $14 for cocktails from \"mixologists\"). I would come back here for sure! Make sure to get a reservation if you're coming on a busier weekend night, it seemed like it could get extremely busy as the night progressed.",

Luckily, the SLS is still not very busy, but the restaurants are fantastic.  Cleo is a Tapas style restaurant that has a Mediterranean flair.  It was delicious.  We probably ordered about 20 items from the menu, and each was fantastic.  This was one of those rare dining experiences, where you can't go wrong.  If it sounds good to you, just get it.  And, depending on the size of the group, get two.  We went to Firefly the previous night, and Cleo brew Firefly out of the water.  I ate with the usual crew, including Mr. Riches.  As we typically have similar ratings for restaurants, Mr. Riches also agreed that this was a great meal.  This may have unseated one of my previous top 5 vegas restaurants.  After working in Vegas for about 4 months now, I have to say that the top 5 are: 1) Mix  2) L'atelier by Joel Robuchon 3) Bazaar Meat 4) Cleo 5) Prime  I'm sure that this rating will change as I continue to try different places.  Cleo is def. a place to try!",

We also got the brussel sprouts with cashews. Just the vinaigrette with the roasted sprouts is amazing. I can't explain the taste but if you like brussel sprouts, get this! For the main, my mom and I split the grilled branzino and the grilled octopus. The branzino was delicious. Perfectly grilled, and not too dry. The octopus wasn't cooked enough in my opinion. It's very hard to do, but it just wasn't the correct texture. Overall, Cleo is a great place. It's on the opposite end of the strip but just hop in an uber and have some delicious Mediterranean food!",

    "text": "Stayed at the SLS and decided to try this place out of convenience and I'm glad we did!   Cleo is a tapas style Mediterranean/Italian style place. It's slightly upscale in attire and environment but not overly so. You can make reservations with the SLS front desk when the restaurant is closed.   Four of us sat to dine and were pretty impressed by the plates we ordered. We tried the hummus, which comes with this great, fluffy bread, the Brussels sprouts (a must try, really well seasoned), grilled octopus, the burrata salad, the spinach and ricotta dumplings (also a must have) and the roman flat bread. The plates are smaller than the norm, but great for tapas style sharing. Even with four people everyone had plenty to eat from all of the plates. The food was more than enough to fill us up and it came out to about $30 per person with drinks. Not bad!   When they ask you about water, say tap unless you don't mind paying $9 per bottle.   Our waiter was really friendly and helpful when explaining the menu. Also, if you're interested in checking out SLS's club Life, ask your waiter about it and see if he or she can get you any bonuses like front of the line passes or something!",

There should not be a table at the end of the marble counter top if that's the area most employees use to walk through.   I ordered:  Hummus with Laffa bread- too much cumin used as a garnish, hummus was so generic in taste and not smooth enough. Laffa bread came out piping hot in a bag but was bland and I know it used as a canvas but because I did not like the hummus I would have liked for it to stand on it's own  Chicken kabob-first one was better than the second. second one was undercooked, luke warm, and did not taste made to order   Lamb kefta kabob- cooked well but not enough seasoning to enhance the natural flavors of the lamb  Shishito peppers-did not like that these were whole because I was eating seeds. They were also greasy and the best part was the Parmesan sprinkled on top   Watermelon salad- none of the ingredients in the salad were very good. Watermelon and avocado were both over ripe, I liked the flavors they were going for in this dish but they needed to use better ingredients and lay off on the dill   Our first waitress had a screechy voice and our second waitress didn't even bring a dessert or do anything special considering it was my friends birthday.   The best thing about Cleo is the hobbit house like atmosphere.",

Some favorites were the lebnah with feta (order extra to put on kebabs!), Greek Salad, Wagyu Beef, house pickles, bread (that came in a cute stamped paper bag,) and everything from the dessert menu. The food was amazing, even to the snobbiest Seattle foodie in our group. We loved sharing it all family style while hoarding the best like the crispy brussels sprouts at one end.   The decor is elegant, playful and interesting. The mismatched vintage dishes were gorgeous and old books and Egyptian \"artifacts\" line the top shelf along the sides of the restaurant. It is so original in any city but it was an especially nice break from some of the overly-themed restaurants on the strip.   To top off our perfect night, Chef Thanawat came out to say hi and meet us. He is a genius in the kitchen and is fun and infectious character to boot. We so appreciated our special night at Cleo. It was a highlight of our 4 days in Vegas and I would come back just to have dinner there again. Thanks Cleo!",

Extremely comfortable, clean with an eccentric, quirky vibe. We started with the Brussels sprouts which is a must order! The sprouts are literally pulled off leaf by leaf and charred in seasoning & oil that just melts in your mouth. Hands down the best sprouts I've ever eaten. Hummus was good & served with homemade flaky pita bread. Cauliflower was next and again an amazing vegetable side dish. I initially ordered the Schwarma as my entree but they ran out. Lindsey had informed us there were only a few left and she would hurry and put our order in, but unfortunately it didn't work out. I settled for my 2nd choice, Moussaka. This dish was different than other Moussaka I've had but it was delicious, very light but awesome flavor. My friend had the scallops which looked amazing, all 5 of them!!She ate every bite so I'm taking that as a plus. The portions are small which I appreciate. We were able to share everything, enjoy our own entrees and leave feeling satisfied, but not gluttonous. All of our food, 2 cocktails & 1 beer and our bill was $125 which I consider very reasonable for Vegas. I highly recommend Cleo and I'm excited to return. I definitely want to try their lamb on my next  go round. I hope your dining experience is as wonderful as mine.",

Some favorites were the wagyu and pork belly kababs, grilled octopus, mushrooms, brussels sprouts and the duck bastilla-- but nearly everything we had (12 small plates in all) was incredibly flavorful and well-prepared. And don't let me forget the cocktails. We ordered six or seven different drinks throughout our meal-- all superb-- and each one had some little unexpected twist to the flavor profile that paired perfectly with the exotic spices in the food.

Anyway, despite that service was good. Food came out almost all at ince due to the \"lateness\". Food was outstanding. The only thing i would not order again was the flatbread and dips.  The bread should be pita. The dips were underseasoned. The lamb tagine, octopus etc were very very good. The dessert was memorable. Would definitely come back.",

The only downside for Cleo is that the SLS Hotel is just a dark depressing place, so tough location, but the restaurant is so good we will be visiting the LA location this weekend.    Service is top notch - couldn't be any better.  And the food...OMG - every dish was spectacular.  We ordered: Yogurt Cucumber dip, Hummus, Pork Belly, Falafel, Spanakopita, Clam with Noodles, Spicy Potatoes, Grilled Octopus, and of course double orders of that amazing bread.  The only thing we would skip next time would be the Hummus - the rest was just beyond words.  We skipped dessert - just too full, but next time we will definitely be trying that Sticky Toffee Pudding.    If you're in Vegas - Cleo is a must!!!  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!",

Cleo is a tapas type of place and the staff spaces it out so you have time between each course to eat slowly and take it all in. There were two of us and we ordered six dishes. We ordered the brussel sprouts, lamb shawarma, scallops, wagyu kebab, mushroom flatbread, and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Each were delicious but I specifically recommend the wagyu, brussel sprouts, and lamb shawarma! The sticky toffee pudding comes out warm with a beautiful presentation and just melts in your mouth. Our server helped us and was extremely attentive and even gave us recommendations for our next couple of days at Red Rock! Thankfully there is a Cleo in LA and so excited to visit again!",

Every course was spot on - and food was plentiful (unlike many tasting menus). In fact, we ended up taking some of it home we were so full. Favorite dishes were grilled octopus and sticky toffee pudding. two small complaints - because we were one of just a few tables, the food came out rather quickly. Normally that would be fine, but with a tasting menu (and their portions) we needed a bit of time to rest which we didn't get. The only other complaint was about their 'famous brussel sprouts' - while they were good, they had gone just a tad far for our taste and had a tinge of bitterness as a result. They were the only dish we didn't finish or take home.",

I went last week & would've liked to check in, but alas, NO CELL SERVICE! Anyways, on to my very positive review. We had reservations & were seated immediately. Our waiter was Ricky & he was fantabulous!!!  Everything from the cocktails to the dishes to the dessert was GREAT!!! I have to give a shoutout to the cocktail Clementina - it's sweet, spicy & fabulous just like the food! They are smaller plates, but the waitstaff will try & tell you it's 4-5 plates a person-I THINK NOT! They are larger than the normal tapas so maybe just 2 a person... You can always order more! We had a little of everything from Mezzes to Raw to Salads to Vegetables to Meats & ALL were wonderful, but a special shoutout must go to the Grilled Octopus-it was to DIE for!!! This comes from a girl who HATES to eat Cephalopods, but it was like having beautiful bites of white steak... I still can't put into words how yummy it truly was!!! We finished our meal with splitting the Sticky Toffee & it was great, too! I really have no complaints other than the location of the restaurant & of course, it's very expensive...over a $100 a person, but well worth it!!!",

We weren't prepared for Jose Andreas' restaurant (financially, lol shame on us) So instead, we explored the casino, and Cleo seemed like our next best option. We decided to walk in, and a friendly hostess seated us immediately. It was around 8pm on Friday night, and the restaurant was approx. 90percent full. I saw a lot of couples, and one bachelorette party group of 10. Sexy exotic ambience with gorgeous chandelier, fire place, and open kitchen in the middle of the floor. We immediately order Hummus and Tahini, because a couple next to us was killing it. (Another couple who saw us eating it ended up ordering the same thing too) A hot and fluffy artisan bread came w/ dip and it was heavenly. I was pretty full off the bread and dip, but we went ahead and ordered some more: garlic shrimp, squid and rice, and one sausage I can't remember the name (lamb). All were uniquely flavored, and reasonably priced. We will definitely come back for more. Hopefully we get to be seated by the kitchen next time :)",

For some reasons this casino is so quiet and empty with a strange feeling to it. walking to the restaurant makes you feel you are going somewhere not very popular. The restaurant set up is very nice and we loved the decor, detail touches and the atmosphere but honestly we were very surprised to be one of the only 3 tables there. It was very empty and quiet so that make it little less exciting.   But the food made up for it. Even though it's kind of a pricey place with a smaller portions but the food tasted good.",

The space was large, I liked the booths placed around and in the middle, as well as the counter seating if you feel like watching the chefs prepare the food.  We were immediately greeted by a very enthusiastic, borderline annoying server. He was really nice, so I can't be too annoyed. He started us out with his two top cocktails on the menu, I went with the Old Hollywood and my friend had the Garbo. I'm a fan of a good hand crafted cocktail, both of these were really good, but I did prefer the the Garbo.  Onto the food. I eat a lot of Middle Eastern food, a lot. I did see some interesting items on the menu. For instance, Kibbeh Nayyeh, I've only found this on the menu at Ali Baba here in town. And it's usually beef, not lamb. I do love Kibbeh Nayyeh.   We tried the brussels sprouts app, which was good (how can you get that wrong) as well as the Duck Bastilla and Lamb Tangine which I found both to be extremely gamey (I love both duck and lamb, and I've never had either item taste as gamey as it did here). We also tried the Kale Flatbread which was my favorite item.   I can't say I was blown away with my experience here. I've had far better Middle Eastern food around town.",

    "text": "Dear Cleo. Can I call you Cleo? Or is it too casual for the Queen of Egypt, better known as Cleopatra? You're my favorite restaurant at the SLS. Not that the others aren't good, but you're simply the best. An affordable Mediterranean culinary experience, with so many different flavors and adapted diet options if you're vegan or gluten-intolerant, a simple yet refined decor, and a great staff. I brought two friends with me there to taste the locals Special Summer Menu. Wait... A 5-course menu, on the Strip, for $35? You must be kidding me. Well... Not at all, this is an awesome deal indeed! Just add $20 for a wine pairing. Humus and feta spread cheese, Brussels sprouts, spicy cigars, beet salad, Greek salad, steak or shrimps, and an amazing chocolate cake (gluten-free) or a sticky pudding as desserts. Small portions, but in the end and after the fourth course we were already full. We left the place with the feeling of being privileged as locals, again with just the right amount of attention from the staff. Not too present, but always careful to our needs and super friendly. So, Dear Cleo, I will visit you again soon, if you don't mind of course. Thanks again guys, we had a blast.",

Happened upon a review totally randomly a few hours ago and very glad that we decided to bite the bullet and drive here to try it out.   The list of \"greatest hits\" on other Yelp reviews is absolutely correct. The range of Mediterranean influences and balance of flavors is really unique and totally delicious. All cocktails are fine tuned & even wines by the glass are all standout.  Our server Manny made a great meal something very special. Knowledgeable, honest with a great sense of humor - Thank you!!",

Our favorites were the Greek salad, hummus, grilled pita, bottomless mimosas, and the Bloody Mary bar.  The value was fantastic.  Cons - the hostesses and servers were clueless.  We arrived a bit early.  They asked for us to start the line in one direction...  then ended up changing it to the other side.  Two parties walked up after we arrived and were sat before us without waiting in line even though we also had reservations.  We sat down and the server was very nice, however, had no idea if we were to get our own coffee and mimosas or if they brought them.  She said that she was figuring everything out.  They should pre-shift their staff before opening the doors.  Also, tables are very tight.  I had to wiggle in and out of my chair just so I didn't bump into the person behind me.",

    "text": "The Skinny: some well executed dishes with some mediocre ones makes this joint a (3.5). Service: our servers were okay but our busboy was freaking amazing! Best busboy ever! (5 stars for the busboy, 3 stars for the servers), value: although a bit on the pricey side for Mediterranean, some of the outstanding dishes are worth returning for (3.5 with a bump up to 4 starred review).  We came during the half priced locals deal on a Sunday. Overall as a Mediterranean high end joint, I was a little skeptical if it was going to be worth it.  Just FYI, service is a bit confusing. We had two servers check in on us with regards to our table so we weren't really certain who we needed to talk to if we needed anything. In terms of explaining the menu, it wasn't immediately clear how many dishes we need to order as a tapas styled restaurant. So just so you know - 2.5-3 dishes/person depending if you order the mezze (smaller dishes) vs. a larger grilled dish.   We tried their hummus with laffa bread, spinach salad with figs, mushrooms with hazelnuts, lamb tagine with harissa, moussaka and duck bastilla.  They started us off with some great little puff pastries stuffed with cheese (I think it was feta). Piping hot, the cheese just oozed lusciously from the crisp layers. Really wonderful way to start a meal!  Hummus with laffa bread coated in za'taar was good. The hummus needs to be mixed a bit before digging in but the flavors were solid. The laffa bread came hot and mildly crispy in a bag on the table.  Spinach salad - also quite nice. I didn't realize that it came with blue cheese (which didn't add anything to the dish) and would have preferred it without. Loved the combination of figs and vinegar dressing.   Mushrooms roasted with hazelnuts were the hands down best dish we had that night. The perfectly golden crust along the crunch of the hazelnuts were fabulous. If you love mushrooms, you will love this dish. It is possibly one of the best dishes I have had all year.  Lamb tagine with harissa: lamb was quite tender however it was a tad bland for me. Would have been nicer with a bit more ?preserved lemons to give it a bit more acidity. Overall, just an okay dish for me.  After this set of dishes, there was lengthy wait about 15 minutes until the next dish. Unlike our server who promised multiple times that our dish was coming, our busboy pretty much made sure we got our dish while keeping our water glasses full and tending to a irate customer who was allergic to nuts who found nuts in her dish. I was impressed with our busboy. He did an excellent job and I wish he was our server instead.  Moussaka: ugh! did not like this dish at all. First of all, the dish was served stone cold in the middle.  Second of all, there was too much nutmeg in this dish - making it taste really off and odd. Never had moussaka like this before. We had to send it back.  Duck Bastilla: this dish was meh and not up to my expectations. In my opinion, the filling was a too wet for me and spiced correctly (needed a lot more cinnamon). The lack of nuts was also very surprising. I would skip this dish.  We finished off with the almond pannacotta with figs. It was okay - the texture was a bit too solid and not quite silky smooth enough. Flavor wise, it was rather uninteresting. I would probably skip this next time.  Overall, given the stellar dishes we received, this joint is worth another look. The service we received by our busboy was phenomenal however the servers were sort of lackluster although they did take off the horrible moussaka after we sent it back. 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4.",

    "text": "We stopped in after having drinks at the monkey bar with my company's owners. Normally food always follows after some drinking and since Umami Burger and their staff completely blow it and embarrassed me after I spoke so highly of them we decides to eat here.   Let me just say I truly redeemed myself with this one. The Greek Mediterranean food was excellent the atmosphere was perfect even though we had to split the party into two booths of 6 or 7 people each.   The wait staff was great but the best part was everything...except for the Grilled squid with saffron mash potatoes and black rice. I normally love squid and all that but it was so fishy and gross I almost threw up at the table. Besides that the rest of the dishes were amazing. We had the lamb sliders, garlic shrimp, hummus, hanger steak, lamb shawarma, moussaka (oh the moussaka), duck bistilla, spinach and ricotta dumplings, bone marrow, raviolo, the spinnacota pretty much the whole menu and bottles and bottles of Stella Rossa! Wow were those all good can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.    Everything was pretty much tapas slash family style so order lots to share because  the little that you do get is all so good. Resturant of coarse was hip and trendy but by all means not trashy very up scale but at the same time very comfy.   One of the best spots to eat at SLS Las Vegas. If you are considering it just do it you will not be disappointed, just stay away from the seafood selections unless you really want the ocean!",

    "text": "We love Cleo LA, so when visiting Las Vegas last weekend, we wanted to check out the other Cleo! Upon entering, the host/hostess and waiter were all very pleasant. We had a 7pm reservation on Friday night, and the restaurant had a few tables full, but was still pretty quiet. Like the LA version, it is well-decorated and has a dark, cozy feel to it. The tables are a bit more spacious/spread apart in this restaurant compared to LA.   To start, our friend and my husband each ordered a drink. I ordered a mocktail, and my husband jokingly said to our friend how when I order mocktails, he wants to start asking for the alcohol on the side (a la when I order an omelette and ask for the cheese on the side for him to have extra cheese), as drinks are many times only a $1 or 2 cheaper without the alcohol. Our waiter overheard this and happily suggested he bring over the alcohol on the side in a shot glass. My husband and our friend (who actually ended up drinking the shot) both got a big kick out of this. As a side note, my fauxito was very good too. Not all club soda, as many can be.  The food was quite good as usual, and the menu was almost identical to Cleo LA, with one exception: it tasted like a full salt shaker was used to cook most items. Other than that, the sauteing on each dish was good, the serving size was good - not too big or small and the pacing that the dishes were brought out was good. We shared:  - Eggplant, Fennel, Chili - Had a vinegar taste to it. Very delicious! The texture of the eggplant wasn't slimy as eggplant can sometimes be, but rather melt-in-your-mouth. The eggplant pieces were thinly sliced.  - Mushrooms - The dates and hazelnuts really add great flavor but let the mushroom shine. Big pieces of mushroom too! The puffed rice adds a nice texture to this and the mushrooms are truly perfectly sauteed here. I preferred these mushrooms to the ones on the flatbread.  - Artichoke, Lemon, Olives - I'm a huge artichoke fan and this didn't disappoint. Lemon is always fantastic with artichoke and they executed this dish well. There were a lot of kalamata olives present, which also worked especially well with the lemon.  - Brussels Sprout Hearts, Hazelnuts, Fresno Chili - I preferred these to Cleo's more famous brussels sprouts. This was almost more of a warm salad, and the soft hearts paired nicely with the many hazelnuts (provided a good crunch) that were in it.  - Seasonal Mushroom Flatbread - Cheesy and nice thin crust. Thick, hefty mushrooms that were well-placed all throughout the flatbread. Didn't taste much in the way of fresno chili that the menu suggested, though.  - Flourless Chocolate Cake - The cake was good, though I wish there was a bit more of a molten center! The cool vanilla gelato, as usual, was the perfect accompaniment, and the best bite was when you got both together. The only thing I'd really change is that a half of a banana was sauteed and served on the side, but served still in its skin. It was kind of odd to keep the banana skin on. When you dug in, the inside was a good texture, but I only had one bite of that, as the outside skin was very odd.  Overall, we love that Cleo offers so much variety and something for everyone. If they tone down the salt a bit on the vegetables, they'll really be in business!",

I have been dying to try it- no better time to try it than the new SLS promotion of #socialsundays. 50% off a different restaurant for locals! (On Sundays).  I was seated right next to the big wood fire oven and OMFG the smell of like garlic and flatbreads was hypnotic. As many of the restaurants at The SLS, plates are meant for sharing, and I thought you get a lot more than the usual tapas size. Plus, the prices here (even if it wasn't the special locals promotion) were very good- between $7-$15 for plates.  The cocktail menu was very unique and delicious. The one I had was the clementina. It's was citrusy and spicy. It complimented my meal so well.  The food was perfection. Everything I had was kissed with roasted yummy goodness. The warm bread for my hummus - omg soooo good.  Plus- I had the greatest server ever- Jessica. She asked if there was anything I didn't like (olives) and made sure she left them out of everything I ordered. She really cared about making my experience great and I felt that.   I felt like I was British royalty visiting Egypt for camel races and was truly delighted by my most decadent meal. (When you eat here, you can pick your own fantasy).  I will be back, Cleo!",

We ended up showing up at 9:55 (the restaurant closed at 10 pm that night). They were nice enough to still seat us and get our order in and served in a timely manner, without making us feel rushed.   We got the following items: brussel sprouts, mushrooms, potato latke, spinach and ricotta dumplings, the artichoke flatbread, the merquez and roman flatbread, and the three dips - hummus, cucumber and yogurt and carrot harissa. We also ordered 2 bottles of wine - there wasn't enough wine in the bottle for the girls that wanted white, so the server was nice enough to just go grab an extra glass for her.   The brussel sprouts and mushroom dishes were phenomenal!!! The two best things we ate that night. I was least impressed with the flatbreads...in comparison to the other dishes we had. The flatbread was extremely thin and crispy, so not heavy at all, but just felt like it could have used more flavor. The spinach and ricotta dumpling tasted very similar to a very soft piece of ravioli.   Overall the dinner was delicious and we all enjoyed it thoroughly! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting vegas and will most likely be visiting again when I am back in town!",

The best I can describe the experience is fusion Med meets Tapas.   Started with two dips, hummus and cucumber/yogurt. The pita was great, not too chewy, just perfect. Both dips were excellent.  Then we had spanakopita and spicy cigars. Possibly the best spanakopita I have ever had and the cigars were like meat filled sping rolls, everyone loved them.  We then had the Brussels sprouts, which even the most carnivorous of us loved. They were crispy shaved Brussels sprouts, reminded me of terrific fried kale I once had at Benny's in Chicago.   Our two meat dishes were also great. Lamb tagine with cous cous was both tender and flavorful. My favorite dish, and most surprising, was the duck bastilla, hard to describe but almost like a duck filled Krispy Kreme donut, just incredible.  Service was excellent though I do feel they could of done a better job pacing the meal, almost felt rushed as the new dishes kept arriving.",

We had the hanger steak, scallops, lamb(they brought it on accident) kabobs wagu, shrimp, and sausage. We enjoyed the meal and it was tasty. With bottle of wine it was around 200$. Our waitress Jessica was great this is a good restaurant to eat at if you stay at SLS.",

    "text": "Hedonism! gluttony! and an orgasmic culinary experience was all on the table today at Cleo. Today Cleo had an all inclusive Mother's Day brunch with unlimited mimosas and Bloody Marys. The mimosas came in orange, apple, passion fruit, mango, and guava which were semi self serve - patrons picked them up at the bar and got to select how much juice they'd like. A Bloody Mary bar had all the condiments needed and a special Mediterranean hot sauce that was fantastic. We sampled them all repeatedly, the juices and Bloody Mary mix were fresh, made in house and delicious.  Cleo specializes in Mediterranean and middle eastern cuisine and items on the buffet brunch such as roasted cauliflower, humus with whole chick peas, baba ganoush, roasted prime rib and lamb with Mediterranean and middle eastern spices were unique and stupendous.  Cleo has a stylish modern decor with Mediterranean and middle eastern accents. The feel is romantic and hip. The service was outstanding, our server Nada was ever present despite the large numbers that she was working with today.  The brunch had a seafood station that was out of this world-king crab legs, oysters, sweet humongous shrimp, and succulent stone crab in enormous mounds.  The crepes were made to order and filled with fresh fruit, chocolate, and an in-house cream. The deserts included various pastries and excellent tarts, chocolate topped cream puffs, and Turkish style baklava. This was our first time we visited Cleo and we will be back guaranteed.",

    "text": "Amazing experience! Definitely a memorable experience to put in the books.  Where do I begin? Had no idea I was coming here as it was a surprise birthday dinner from my better half. Glad she chose this place inside of the SLS hotel/casino. Perfect date spot...  We arrived close to the last seating (being 10:30 P.M) and the spot was pretty empty; although it was a Monday night; not so sure why so many restaurants in Las Vegas seem to close early but there must be some explanation. Anyhow, the atmosphere is upscale, chill playlist and some of the best servers/waiters that can be found...wish I could recall ours as he was great.  We started with a couple cocktails. Can not recall what she had but I went with a CUCUMBER SMASH consisting of Jameson whiskey, muddled cucumbers, some type of flower liqueur and lemon. Very good drink! 15.00 as with all of their cocktails. And from the two we had, I would say rest assured they are not skimping on the alcohol.  So the menu has a ton of small plates of which you can freestyle or go with one of their tasting menus. One option is 50.00 each, the other 65.00 with a two-person minimum. We chose to freestyle as there were too many enticing options that we would be sharing.  We started with a couple vegetable plates... the EGGPLANT (10.00) w/chili and fennel was so-so but the MUSHROOM (13.00) with the hazelnuts and puffed rice was def. ON point!   Next, we ordered BABAGANOUSH( 10.00 w/bread), and TUNA TARTAR(14.00). The tuna tartar should be taken off of the menu because it was the only thing that we both agreed that we found below standard compared to all of the other dishes we had.   Then came, OYSTERS (16.00) fantastic!...maybe I should I be complaining of the price for only four but as good as they were...probably not! And...The highlight of everything we had...and worth coming here for...the GRILLED OCTOPUS  ($who cares). Come here and try, you'll probably order more plates.  We actually ordered another after this...being a flatbread... the MARQUEZ (15.00?). This being a thin crust pizza with spicy lamb sausage, peppers, onions, and mooz. Fantastic. We, at this point, took half to go and finished off cold at the airport.  Not sure if it was from my amazing woman mentioning it or if she said beforehand but they came with an amazing cake for my bday...soft and hot chocolate mixed with cold ice cream (caramel topping) and a hard, crispy, sweet cracker on top. Unbelievable!  P.S. to the SLS, CREO, and more importantly...the beautiful woman that made this happen. Best birthday dinner ever! Thank you!  P.S.S. The SLS Hotel and casino will be getting fewer starts..I'll keep you posted.  P.S.S.S. Hey Peter D...is this how a yelp review should be?",

Out of the 3x, the best and most attentive service was dinner at the bar. The two bartenders were attentive and quick on every level.  Regular table service dinner has been a different story. The first visit the restaurant was empty except for us and 4-5 other tables. We had to look for and ask after our server numerous times. The food was good but a couple of dishes arrived room temperature. The second time we ate here was for a business dinner with 10 people in which we spent over $1k. Again, the restaurant had other tables but was not busy and again the service was lacking. We had to ask the bus boy numerous times to send over the server, request water for the table etc. Frustrating because the food here is delicious but they definitely need some changes to the service approach.",

It actually made it yummier.   The chicken tagine was very good, even though a bit on the small side.   The environment is very warm, dimly lit. Service staff is exceptional.

Although it does say tapas style, I personally think the portions are a little bigger then typical tapas style.   My party and I got mostly meat dishes, and let me tell you, they were all to die for. I don't have a favorite as they were all amazing! The kababs were cooked perfectly, and you are able to pick three different meat choices for that. The dessert we got Sticky toffy pudding and it was perfect!  The ambiance and vibe was also super cute and hip. I would defiantly come here again for a fancy date night or a girls night out type of vibe.",

    "text": "4.5 stars. I'm skeptical about hotel & casino restaurants, but Cleo is one of the best ones I've ever been to. About 50 of us were seated in the back after the first day of our meeting. There was a prie fixe, family-style menu (with printed copies) and everything the organizer selected was delicious.  All the dishes were brought out in a random order, separated on smaller plates and scattered across the table. It was a smorgasbord from heaven. The wait staff also made sure to take good care of guests with dietary restrictions. These were my favorites:  * Hummus with Tahini + Laffa Bread * Cauliflower with Vadouvan, Cashews * Brussel Sprouts with Capers, Almonds, Vinaigrette, * Grilled Hangar Steak with Grilled Peewee Potatoes, Spoon Salad  Service was quick and attentive. The only thing is Cleo seems to value a high table turnover time. After all, business was popping! Plates were cleared when they still had food or when people were still eating. Sometimes they asked if we were done. But overall this was a top-notch dining experience, and I would love to come back here again if I ever attended another event at SLS Station!",

On the menu, there was a \"tasting\" for $65, but tbh we ordered 5-6 things and it was the same price + we were able to try everything we wanted (which included a cocktail).  We ordered babaghanoush (the bread they served with it was unreal), dolmades, scallops (the lettuce/garnish or whatever that came with it was really good), bone marrow (a VERY hefty serving size), wagyu beef kebobs and something else I think.   For tapas style, I felt that the servings were generous. The cocktail I had was nothing to write home about, but it was decent -not so bad it deserved taking off a star.  I left feeling full and satisfied.  The best part, since it's Mediterranean, the full feeling isn't heavy.  Win-win for me.",

The noise level was a bit loud for the ambience but not too bothersome.  The atmosphere is definitely upscale, this would be a great date night spot.   We had a pleasant server. I came for the happy hour as I saw it was available on Thursday night. She stated they don't have it that day but she went and asked the manager and ended up giving the Happy hour menu.   Some of the food ordered are Hanger Steak from the Regular dinner menu. From the happy hour menu, we chose Pork Belly that blew me away. The spices they used were flavorful. The Lamb Shawarma tasted fresh and very authentic.  For desert, don't miss out on Fig and Almond Panacotta. It's simply the best.  The only dislike was the table next to us was too close, you can give a High 5.  Totally recommend checking this place out.",

    "text": "Had dinner here before the Rock in Rio.  After having a lot of bad dining experiences, this one was remarkably amazing. It was a flawless experience.  Owners and managers seem to fail to understand that it's not just their food but the entire experience that makes a person wish to return. The details were so amazing, so I'm going to share them.  We were greeted immediately by a smiling, cordial hostess who was very welcoming. No attitude or lacking of interest in us as many places hire young ladies who are used to non-human communication of their phones.  Seated at a great clean table near the bar. Love the dim lights and candle on the table.  Menu has a light tan background so was hard to read but they have menus printed with bigger print with a white background and not only brought us those (for our older eyes), but a pair of readers for my friend.  Andre came over to us right away, like within a minute, with a big smile and great attitude. He was very knowledgable of the menu and gave us great suggestions.  Everything came out like a symphony... When the beer was ready, someone delivered it. Not our waiter, but another server that seemed to be just helping him. Great teamwork.  I loved the  bread that comes in a bag to keep it warm.  We ordered the cucumber yogurt dip appetizer and it was amazing. We had falafel, fried artichokes, one of the flatbreads, and the Greek Salad. I loved everything. Lots of attention to detail and great flavors.  Staff was extremely attentive.  The music was very sexy and amazing adding to the atmosphere.  I love the cool water bottles they leave on the table so you don't have to wait for refills but they are very attentive to keeping your glass full.  Andre kept an eye on us enough to be happy but not too much to be bothersome.  It was beyond refreshing to have a completely flawless dining experience.",

Cleo is the perfect place for a light meal or snack it's a shame that it's only open for dinner as it's the perfect lunching location. The lebaneh and feta with laffa, maybe some lamb or chicken kabobs and some tea you have yourself a delicious meal for $15. The waitresses are a little pushy when it comes to ordering more plates, but it is a tapas restaurant so it's to be expected. Biggest complaint is it's not open for lunch.",

    "text": "This restaurant had the most laughably bad service I had experienced in Vegas.   Here is the setup: * large group (10 of us), all local, all foodies, all hungry, but all in a good mood.   * great environment, table, music.  Here are the problems, in chronological order: * 1/2 empty restaurants should never take that long to seat someone with a reservation.  6-7 minutes.  and 1/2 empty is generous.  * Look, I lived in Spain for a while so I understand Tapas culture.  But menu items showed up so randomly and so far apart that you would almost assume they forgot about us or served other people our food.  * They brought us 3 dishes we did not order.  Then they re-brought us the same dish (the 1st of the 3) 5 minutes later as if to say \"going twice......\"  Is this an auction?  * The silverware was cleared, in preparation for what we thought was coffee and dessert time.  Instead, they brought out more of our food.  Coordination / chaos.  * The server then asked if we wanted to keep the food out there, and we asked them if they noticed the missing silverware.  So they were a bit matter-of-fact and humorless as if this is normal course-of-business.  \"OK, do you want me to bring silverware back so you can finish your last 2-3 courses?\"  * After turning down the final plates post-silverware clearing, we were presented with dessert menus and set up with dessert plates and coffee cups.  We each ordered dessert.  Then the manager came by 5 minutes AFTER ordering and said \"we are sorry, the kitchen is closed. We didn't know you would be staying so long.\"  Some restaurants deserve a second chance.  I used to work in the service industry, and I know that sometimes you can't do anything right.  This was just one of those nights for them. But it was a complete disaster - and it was specifically MISMANAGED / POORLY COORDINATED.  The place has promise, but would need a new GM and waitstaff that care.",

Food- being local, from dec 1st-23rd. All restaurants except bazaar is HALF OFF. Including alcohol!! You just need you players card. What a deal so we couldn't resist but go to Cleo again. We ordered about 4 items. Started with the hummus with tahini with their pita bread. SO GOOD. Then we ordered the 3 kebabs for $29 which is the burribatta sausage which taste like salami, though that was the best, the lamb kefta which my boyfriend thought that was the best and the chicken which is nice also, not dry. The dish came with saffron rice as well. Then we ordered the scallops, TO DIE FOR. The favorite thing we ordered in my opinion, had this salad topped off with it with this sauce. It was sooooo delicious. And then we also ordered the grilled octopus which we love ordering at places but this grilled octopus was a little too sour for our palates. It was cooked well though. Just didn't expect the sourness in the sauce they put it in. By then we were stuffed. Along with dinner we ordered cocktails, my boyfriend ordered the gardo which was Hennessy and champagne and I order the vinebury which was super refreshing, it was like a spicy mojito.   Ambience- super cute, very rustic and modern which tan leather booths, lighting is dark but it sets the right mood and atmosphere for it. There's books and shelves as decor. A lot of brown and white. Not too loud, not too busy at all.   Service- can't complain. Our waitress was super accommodating. She recommended our drinks and some things to order. We were totally surprised the alcohol was included for the half off deal. Couldn't ask for anything else. Our waitress was super nice and didn't rush us at all.   Overall, an amazing experience. Love Cleo.",

We really enjoyed Cleo's happy hour. We also tried their lam shawarma, it was the best I've ever had. Their Brussels sprouts are to die for, Crispy like potatoes chips.

    "text": "We chose Cleo at SLS for our final hurrah during Restaurant Week. We had no trouble securing a reservation via opentable with only an hour's notice. This dinner was just my husband and I. Though, it would've been a good choice for a group because much of the menu is served family style. It would've allowed us to sample more items, but fear not, we had ourselves a feast for $40.15 per person (+$16 for lamb).   The restaurant itself is rather peculiar, but I liked the quirkyness. I really admired the open kitchen. Service was attentive, management checked in a few times to be sure we wanted for nothing. That attention to detail is a nice touch.   We thoroughly enjoyed the first course. We loved both the Hummus and the Spicy Cigars. The laffa bread took us directly to carb heaven. It was light, airy and perfectly seasoned. Ideal for dragging it through the smooth and creamy hummus. The Spicy Cigars were like meaty spring rolls, they were packed with flavor and pleasantly cooled with the tangy sauce. Consuming ten of these bad boys would be an easy feat.   Next were the Spicy Potatoes & Eggplant. The potatoes didn't have much kick, but they were loaded with flavor. I think I misunderstood \"spicy\" but they were satisfying. The eggplant, on the other hand, was a dud. A little disappointing, but it left room for other tasty bites.   Next we were each served a portion of Chopped Salad. The husband thought it had too much cucumber so I took his home as leftovers. I loved the salad! It was so fresh, crisp and filled with bright flavors. I've never had freekeh before, I am now a fan. It's a bit nutty and chewy, it was a perfect fit in the salad. It was delicious the next day too.   Moving on to the entrees we had Beef and Soukouk Kebabs with Saffron Rice, Couscous and Seven Vegetable Soup and Lamb Tagine ($16 add-on). The kebabs were my favorite both with bold seasoning. He was fond of the lamb. I admit you cannot beat the tenderness achieved in a tagine. The couscous was pretty dry and the soup was bland until we added some zest with the harissa.   Sticky Toffee Pudding seemed like an unlikely option at a Mediterranean restaurant, but it was extremely delicious. Baklava was prepared two ways and they were fine versions, but it was our least favorite dessert.   Beers and cocktails were a bit steep; Weihenstephaner ($10) and Stella ($9). But it didn't stop us from ordering them anyway. Cleo is a fun twist on tapas and it's rather unique. It definitely fills a niche on the Las Vegas strip.",

Several dishes were tasty, but in our opinion they didn't capture the flavor and spirit of the holiday.  As locals we've tried many of the restaurants on the strip. On second take I would recommend a more traditional dinner at The Country Club at Wynn, Carmines, Del Friscos Double Eagle Steakhouse, or the Capital Grill to name a few.",

The atmosphere is great- like any fine dining on the strip, the food tastes amazing, but it won't burn a hole through your wallet like many eateries on the Las Vegas Strip.  I have been to Cleo on several occasions and everyone that I have dined with is a fan. The first time I visited- I was on a very strict diet and they were very accommodating for me. Everything I have eaten here is tasty and I mean everything. The pita bread is warm and fluffy, hummus is smooth and delicious and the fish is always cooked to perfection.  I wish it was closer to my house and I would be going on a weekly basis. Such a great spot and look forward to going again soon.",

Here's what i had:  - Grilled octopus: Loved it!! Not rubbery at all as i had feared. Delicious and highly recommended! :-) - Cauliflower with cashews: Curry flavor, a bit spicy, but good - Spanakopita: You get three and they are tasty..filled with spinach and feta cheese - Lotus Flower cocktail: Delicious, not too sweet. Light fruity and floral flavor.  Service and atmosphere were great. Overally, positive experience and would come back when in Vegas.",

Shishito  peppers, hummus at first but they forgot about it and literally a whole hour went by, I was not sure if they were waiting for the garbanzo beans to grow out of the physical ground or not so I changed it to babaganush!, another round of a dozen oysters and octopus! The crazy thing is alllllllll of the food eventually came but the last item to hit the table was a tiny little skewer of chicken kabob. I mean this was a typical Thursday night in Vegas aka not busy especially in a pricey restaurant like this one. I would def go back for my drink and everything else but the clam dish, bland bland bland, where was the clam? No clue because it was the size of a pebble! lol   The drink I tried was called the Vinberry and it was delicious!!!!!!",

They said bar is open seating.  But it was full.  We decided to wait for a open place. Waited about 15 min.  We met the bartender Stephan and one of the front of house managers.    We decided to do the tasting menu and do a app of oysters.   The food came out fast.  Maybe a bit to fast really. The first portions of the tasting menu anyway.   I was pretty sure it was to push out food before the ticket machine went nuts, the Place was packed.  But we were having a good time with Steven.  Lol his yelp was awaiting him lol.    They had a very difficult customer.  They really handled her well.  I'm convinced she was doing it for free stuff. But again they handled her well.   Our food was very good.   We did not get the oyster though.  I'm sure they went to another table.  We saw them get put in.    All in all great meal great fun. Steven and the manager were awesome.    Food good.  Customer service great. Fun place.",

A couple waters and perused the menu as well as the Restaurant week 5 course offering for $40 a person. Most courses had 3 options so we both decided on different items so we could each share 10 items! Oh and since we love the oysters here and the babaganoush I guess we made it 12 items!

We had a reservation for 7:30 pm on a Wednesday night. There were a few tables but it was not extremely busy.   I ordered the hummus with laffa to start (not pictured) a Greek salad and a raspberry twist cocktail (the tequila creeps up on you with this cocktail). I loved this cocktail it was refreshing after a long day walking on the strip. I'm partial to cocktails with fresh berries and/or herbs.   For our entrees I ordered the roasted lamb served on a bed of Lebaneh (creamy yogurt spread) and Israeli couscous. I loved this dish, the combination worked very well together. My only complaint if I'm being absolutely picky is that the lamb was not warm enough. We also had the hangar steak with potatoes and salad. The steak was delicious and cooked to temperature.   For dessert we ordered the fig and amaretto panacotta. I'm a huge fan of panacotta and this one was unique. I loved all of the components of this dessert. I'm not a huge fan of nuts, but the almond brittle that was served with this dessert was the perfect accompaniment. I could eat this dessert 10x it was that good.",

The ambience was very elegant and sexy, I enjoyed the service and professionalism of the bartender during our visit. She explained happy hr and gave suggestions. The drinks were good and not watered down, and the food was delicious with lots of flavor. Portion size was small compared to other restaurants in Vegas, so be prepared to pay. Being honest.  I would give them a chance for dinner.  Yes and Yes I will return when Im in Vegas! Great experience.",

This place was really good and for the fact that we got so much food for the price was outstanding. The service was great, food was great, atmosphere was great! Overall I would totally would go back again for regular food menu to try more out. By far out of everything we had, the spicy cigars were my favorite. The sticky toffee pudding was good but wasn't my overall favorite. But overall the food and everything was absolutely great!",

We decided to stop by this restaurant for happy hour specials before Monique does Vegas comedy show...and it was a great experience. The bartender was very courtesy and professional. She was very helpful and gave us some suggestions on drinks and appetizers. The ambience is very classy and romantic. The restrooms are male and female. The entire restaurant was very clean and maintained to the highest standard for cleanliness.  I would visit them again and will recommend them to friends.",

I took my husband here after raving how amazing the food is. We didn't make a reservation but luckily a table was open an hour later so we hit the roulette table to kill time.   Our table was located towards the back. The only drawback to this place is the noise level. It does get very loud with everyone's voices bouncing around the room. But our service was excellent. They have an awesome share deal where it's $65 per person that I got with coworkers the last time and it felt like the food never ended!   My food favorites here are first and foremost the grilled octopus. It's out of this world amazing! Also the spicy cigars, Brussels sprouts, and scallops are all my top picks. The laffa and all dips are great too. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   For two of us, we had the octopus, lamb sliders, tuna tartare and laffa with lebaneh and feta. This was plenty to make us full.",

It's like that unfairly pretty girl in high school who is also genuinely nice and smart and funny.  So I just gave it a side-eye as I devoured it.  We ordered the lebaneh with feta to dip the lovable bitch bread in, and the complimentary hummus was just as tasty.  Our Greek salad was good, and fine to share if 2 or 3 people are desperate to shove a bit of tasty roughage down their pipes in preparation for a return to real life.  The skewer trio (chicken, shrimp, lamb) was perfectly light and incredibly flavorful.  I tried to mitigate my three days of reckless carb consumption by asking for a lighter side dish, and our server (Neda?  Spelling might be off but she was a delight) recommended the cauliflower couscous in lieu of the saffron rice.    I actually was disappointed when it landed on the table because I saw a lot of currants in it (death to raisins forever), but once I actually tasted it, my mouth stayed too full to complain.  It was so very very yummy.  Ask for that cauliflower couscous, y'all!  The downside to hitting Cleo as a last supper was that we were too exhausted (aka still drunk from earlier) to order cocktails or dessert, but I'd love to return on my next trip to LV.",

    "text": "Long overdue!  We were beyond pleased with our visit to Cleo. After carefully searching for places to select for my babe's birthday I honed in on Cleo for its different style and enticing menu. My expectations were blown thru the roof. Cleo has an intimate ambiance; which is not easily achieved by most restaurants that are in the lobbies of casinos in Las Vegas.  After a brutal hike and near death experience, arriving at Cleo's felt like opening heaven's door. The restaurant is located in the lobby of the SLS hotel. They have free parking.   Browsing quickly over the menu we decided that the tasting menu wasn't for us (meaning: we like to eat and that wasn't enough). We ordered two delicious cocktails; I had The Old Vegas which consisted of gin, oranges, and I can't remember the rest but it was great. He had a cucumber cocktail which was unbelievably refreshing.  The plates I'll recommend are: Grilled Octopus~Celery, Potatoes, Lemon Vinaigrette. Mushrooms~Dates, Hazelnuts, Puffed Rice (best mushrooms ever). Oysters~ Chili-Lime Mignonette, Granite (small portion, order 2).  Everything was superb.  A must! I highly recommend!",

    "text": "This was a solid four star restaurant located inside of SLS Casino. My husband has been wanting to try it for a while, and I am a huge fan of tapas style dining in addition to Mediterranean food being some of my favorite. We made reservations for 7:30pm and were promptly seated. The ambiance is intimate yet social -- it is open kitchen style adding that extra entertainment factor. Even though it is tapas, keep in mind that many of the choices are protein heavy and will fill you up quickly. I would suggest perhaps starting with 2-3 plates for two people and progressing from there. They have an extensive wine and cocktail list as well. I really enjoyed Old Vegas with Aviator Gin, muddled orange and fresh lemon. They started us off with amazing delicious hummus coupled with incredible pita bread. Our plate choices were Oysters (4), Grilled Octopus (personal favorite), Shishito Peppers with Parmesan (light and delicious until I bit into a really spicy one, ouch!), Roast Lamb with couscous, and finished off with Wagyu kebab (2nd favorite) which costs extra $4 and does not include a side so we opted for saffron rice. I do wish they served more of the delicious pitas they served initially with the hummus. Overall, everything was balanced well with perfect flavor and texture. We finished off with Greek coffee and felt satiated and happy with our meal. Our server was personable and very helpful. The price point was a bit high for me taking into consideration portion sizes and lack of sides. Despite the small list of cons I would certainly recommend this place and be back myself to explore more of their menu.",

    "text": "I have been to Cleo before.  While at the SLS, I was going to have a burger at Umami.  Sanity took over when I realized it would be slammed with the NFL playoffs and it was packed and loud.  Instead, I opted for a more relaxed dinner at Cleo--a wise choice for a couple of reasons.  My server was Jessica and one could not have a better person as their server!  Because many of their dishes are meant to be shared, I had to ask about my picks based on dining solo.  Jessica was a great help!  I started with harira soup--a spicy Moroccan vegetable soup with chick peas, cilantro, and harira (lemon) in a tomato based stock.  This had nom lamb as some harira soup does.  Next up was kibbeh nayeh--lamb tartare, bulgar, mint, and labaneh served with some flat bread and a spoon to put the tartare on the crisps.  The mint was in small flakes interspersed on the dish with flaked red pepper.  The labaneh was on top of the tartare under a wedge of lemon to squeeze on the raw lamb for some zest.  It was a great dish.  For the main course, I got the Moroccan fried chicken with apricot mustard, harissa aioli, and a small serving of pickled vegetables.  The harissa aioli was stunning in how good it was.  The apricot mustard was OK but a bit sweet for my tastes in a main course.  If you look at the photo, it looks like the captions are not right.  The mustard looking dish is not mustard but the spicy harissa aioli.  The apricot mustard is the lighter dish.    Jessica brought a dessert menu and told me the first two were her favorites.  The first one--sticky toffee pudding--I already had on a previous visit so I ordered the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla gelato.  The chocolate is Ecuadorian arriba chocolate.  The menu suggests a 15 minute wait but it was less than that.  The chocolate cake was so very rich and the gelato was excellent!  Boy, am I glad it was playoff day!  Instead of some hamburger, I had great Mediterranean food from Cleo.  They now have a tasting menu but it requires two people minimum.  Next time with a friend--or not--but there will be a next time.",

The experience begins under the pyramid-shaped entrance. Feels like you've traveled thousands of miles into another country. The lighting...furniture, Moroccan tiles, art, all the details are all so pretty. As if that wasn't enough there's an open kitchen with a brick-covered oven filling the space with intoxicating aromas.   Begin with a cocktail and loosen up a little. They offer many great options.   As for the food, here are some of my favorite dishes perfect for sharing. Lebaneh with feta (basically a yogurt cheese), hummus with tahini, spicy potatoes with cilantro aioli, brussels sprouts, falafel, and the grilled octopus that's always the star of the show.   Two fun facts! Free dip with Yelp check-in. Thanks Yelp! And parking is free at the SLS. Thank you SLS!!!",

It had an old diner vibe yet decorated Mediterranean style. I thought it would be more closed off and open inside. There were beautiful chandeliers and an amazing, large brick oven. It never got crowded but that's probably because we went early and a lot of people eat later. Since I don't like crowds, this was another plus.   My husband and I had already looked at the menu online so we pretty much knew what we wanted. We ordered the hummus with tahini(so good and had full chickpeas inside the dip), dolmades, falafel, Roman flatbread, wagyu kabobs and lamb chops. It was all to die for! The lamb was so seasoned and perfect in every way. I loved how the falafel was served on hummus with tabouleh, it went together nicely.  The Roman flatbread tasted very strongly of olives, which can be good or bad depending if you like olives. I loved how paper thin it was, yet still didn't collapse when you picked it up.   I wish I could say we ordered dessert but there was no way. So much filling, delicious foods.   The service was good, and quick. Each plate was brought out in perfect timing.",

The staff was very helpful with explanations and we asked them about their personal favorites. The bread was over the top along with the two dips we ordered. The Brussels sprouts were by far our favorite. Such a unique dish with tons of flavor and texture. Had several different kabobs, all superb. Watermelon salad, beet salad. Very refreshing. Beautiful chandeliers, tables well spaced. Not a fan of the music choices, but I guess it goes with the theme. The staff was very attentive and food flowed flawlessly. Being local, I have to say, I think I found my new favorite restaurant.",

Favorites were probably the brussel sprouts, Greek salad, grilled octopus, but loved all.  Highly recommend if in Vegas.",

The watermelon feta salad is for sure a must have. I would describe as perfection at its best.  The Brussel sprout leafs amazing another must have.  Of course no meal is complete without a good drink. The Old Hollywood is a perfect mixed signature drink to complement your meal.  Also tried the lamb tartar which is on my favorites at Cleo as it melts in your mouth with all the flavor that leaves you wanting more .   I have had the pleasure of having the same server both times and it's horrible I can't remember his name. However I will get it and put it in here as he is awesome!   Good for groups or a date night this place will not disappoint!",

Tasteless for the Asian / middle eastern pallet.  no rich flavors  Tea -  from a tea bag.   bottled water -  smaller than usual bottles.  can fill up 3 guest glasses chicken tangine - served skin on, very tender but no taste. lamb shwarma -  street vendors in london do better job    roast lamb.  get 5 pieces of tenderloin sliced -  no taste, very gamey taste that comes  from it being of a certain quality.  high quality lamb does not have that much game taste  overall, not going back.  better middle east options in town for fraction of cost.",

    "text": "Delicious, flavorful food, but the service was not good.  My fiance and I decided to check this place out on Sunday night to celebrate our recent engagement. We walked up to the host stand and had to greet the woman behind the desk before she acknowledged us. She asked how many and our first and last name. I asked her if there was a wait and she said no but proceeded to make us stand there awkwardly for over 5 minutes until another hostess could come seat us. I proceeded to tell the hostess we were celebrating our engagement but she must not have cared that much because she sat us in a row of 2 tops in between a single woman and two older women. Needless to say that put a damper on the rest of our dining experience. There were booths and other more intimate tables available all over and so I asked to move to one of the booths and she went and approved it with the front and then came back and moved us. We were not greeted for over five minutes, and then waited over ten minutes just for water! Once our waiter came back with the water we ordered a few drinks and put in an order for some hummus in hopes that it would come out quickly as we were starving. Another ten minutes go by before we received our cocktails. When he came back to drop them off, we told him we wanted to put in an order for our meal and he said he would be right back, this time another 5 minutes go by so with my calculations over twenty-five minutes have gone by with no food. We finally get the rest of our tapas ordered and after another five minutes we received a salad we ordered as part of our meal. Still no hummus, which we saw others around us receiving. Upon delivery of our salad we asked the server who delivered it if she could check on our hummus. Our original server stops by a few moments later and realizes he forgot to ring it in. It was delivered a few minutes later with some apologies. After the initial thirty minutes of our bad service, he seemed to be more involved. I don't know if the guy was panicking with the thought of us complaining but we felt like what was supposed to be a romantic night of celebration for us was ruined by absent minded staff and terribly slow service for a tapas restaurant. We did have some amazing cocktails including the Old Hollywood and the Honey Citrus Sidecar. The hummus with tahini and the bread served with it was warm, toasty and we craved having a second helping. We also ordered the grilled halloumi salad, which was mildly dressed with sweet vinaigrette and the salty fried cheese served with it paired beautifully. The house pickles were a fun snack, the meatball tagine were incredibly moist, had a nice smokey flavor too them and the sauce dipped perfectly into that toasty bread. The vegetable beignet were a good mix of different fried veggies served with a dill tahini sauce, the fig and almond panacotta was light, creamy and the real vanilla bean in it was the perfect finish to our meal. My fiance also had a Turkish coffee which he enjoyed. I wish I could give this place a higher rating as the food was very very flavorful and we loved that we were able to try several different dishes without walking away feeling uncomfortably full. The restaurant itself was stylish, had a great open kitchen floor plan and looked like a great place to have a fun dinner party or an intimate date. However, the delay of good service was disappointing and it would have shown us he realized he had made a mistake if he had asked a manager to take the hummus off of our bill, which did not happen.",

The labneh dip they give you with the hummus and bread at the beginging of your meal is INSANELY AMAZING!!! im not sure what they put in it to make it so good but boy will that labneh make you drool. All the tapas we got were delicious, including the falafel, potatoes, scallops, shrimp... others in my group got the clams, octopus and they raved about it all night!!",

They food was great, staff was friendly, one staff member Danny sang for my girlfriend. Then the chef made a special desert just for her in order to fit candles that I got for her that spelled out \"29 again\" so he did that in order to fit all the candles. Just a wonderful experience.

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. Mediterranean is my favorite cuisine, and this place was highly recommended to me, so I saved this spot for a special occasion and made a reservation for my birthday. The decorative touches of the dining room are thoughtful well put together, but most of the dishes were not. The tapas dishes we started with were great, but instead of escalating to a crescendo with great entrees and dessert, those dishes disappointed.   FALAFEL: Heralded in other reviews as one of the best versions in town, I had high hopes for this dish and I was not disappointed. Small, crisp balls with a nutty, soft interior plated on flawlessly creamy hummus and a nicely acidic tabouli salad. Simple but solid. GRILLED EGGPLANT WITH FENNEL AND CHILI: Great! So many flavors in this mix of vegetables, but considering it's placed in the \"wood fired\" category of the menu, I would have liked a bit of char to the eggplant or onion. Regardless, this was tasty and the eggplant itself was tender. KIBBEH NAYEH: I love a good tartare but have never had lamb this way. It's wonderful! I found it a touch tough but flavorful; I enjoyed how the dish incorporated mint and lebaneh. Highly recommend! HOUSE PICKLES: Misleading name. This is a dish of house-pickled cauliflower, celery, and carrots. These got spicier as we got deeper into the dish. BF loves pickled foods but we both found this combination of vegetables odd and unsatisfying. Remove from the menu. CHICKEN TAGINE: Here's where things started to head south.  Rice was a touch overcooked and almost mushy, chicken was flavorful and well-seasoned but a bit overcooked and dry. Small mistakes, but ordering this dish felt like a big mistake. GRILLED OCTOPUS: Probably the most-recommended dish in other reviews, this fell completely flat for me. The actual octopus was overshadowed by the giant cloud of shredded celery atop the dish, and the portion size was small (even compared to others in town) and lacked flavor. The octopus was only slightly charred but had little to no seasoning. I enjoyed the potatoes and lemon vinaigrette more than the actual octopus. The version at Bazaar Meats is miles better, and it's not even the best version in town (Jaleo holds that honor). This can't possibly be the same octopus dish others raved about unless they've never had it before. SCALLOPS: Another case of small mistakes. The scallops were slightly rubbery and did not have an adequate sear, indicating that they were not cooked on high enough heat. The piquillo-almond puree and brown butter accents were wonderfully harmonious, but not enough to make up for the star of the dish falling flat.  FIG & ALMOND PANACOTTA: I love a good custard, and this was nicely creamy and paired well with the figs... but the delicate, balanced flavors were overshadowed by the harsh amaretto poured on top. Cooked down into a more mellow syrup, this would have been much better but instead it was borderline offensive. We did not finish this.  It soured my mood a bit that I made note of my birthday when making my reservation and not once was it acknowledged or mentioned in any way- not even when the information was pulled up as we were greeted. Our server was nice, but the dishes she recommended to us were the most expensive ones we ordered and the most underwhelming. At the end of our meal, she never came back after dropping off the bill; eventually a manager stepped in to check us out.   It's a gorgeous space and I might consider coming back for a few of the smaller dishes, but I was extremely disappointed with my overall experience- we enjoyed less than half of what we ordered and were virtually forgotten by our own server.",

A group of 4 of us came for dinner on a Friday night; We arrived, were seated almost immediately and the service was spot on all evening.   This place features small plates which are served up as they're ready, so we ordered several for the table, along with a few bottles of wine.  Everything we tried from the pork belly to the hummus, cauliflower, lamb chops and dumplings to the flatbread and bone marrow.. It was one of those rare occasions where each dish was as good or better than the one before it. There was really no low point in this meal.  The flourless chocolate cake and toffee pudding we shared for dessert were also divine!  Cleo is definitely not cheap. Indeed, we ended up running up a tab of more than $100/person with no effort at all, but it was definitely worth it IMO.  We left this place fully satisfied!",

There's a pillar with Arabic writing on it that's nice but doesn't tie in to any of the other design elements. The books around the seating area is ramdom.  Overall the decor sucks. The music isn't much better. What does Coldplay and Justin Bieber have in common with a Mediterranean restaurant? NOTHING!  The food however is pretty damn good. The mushrooms were amazing!  The watermelon salad was interesting with good flavor as was the beet salad but in both salads there was chunks of avocado which didn't belong. They didn't add anything to the salad, they were just there.  The bone marrow was good but small and subpar to other bone marrow dishes I've had, it needed some authentic Mediterranean Sea salt.  The Brussel sprouts were also very good.    Overall the food is appealing and tasty but not throughly thought out but the decor and ambiance leaves a lot to be desired.  I would return again to try some dishes that sounded good but I'm not dying to return.  It definitely lacked that WOW factor.",

    "text": "This place does not disappoint if your taste buds are craving for mediterranean flavor.  I have been to the Cleo restaurant at the Redbury Hotel in Hollywood and this place is essentially the same.  It feels a little more open-space than the Hollywood location, and perhaps less crowded (but I went on a Sunday late night dinner).  The decor inside is romantic!  They have rooms with curtains that you can draw as well.  For 2, we shared the babaganoush, an order of shrimp kabob and an order of chicken kabob as well as mushroom flatbread.  I would say this was the perfect amount for 2 if you are not a heavy eater.  The dishes are more like tapas-style, so they are meant to be shared and come out in small plates versus traditional entree size portions for one.  If you are hungry, you may need to add some more meat/protein to this order.  The bread that comes out with the dips is phenomenal and has a mix of zataar (mediterranean spice) sprinkled on it and comes out piping hot.  This alone is heavenly!! The dip is also good, the meats are flavorful and the flatbread is delicious as well.  I have had nothing bad here so far.  If you are craving dessert, I recommend the sticky toffee pudding.  Service was so-so, even on a somewhat slow night.  I was happy to be able to dine in Cleo while in Vegas visiting and still taste the same delicious food as the Hollywood restaurant!",

    "text": "Restaurant Week 2015 Dinner $40.15 Donation Level: Gold Platter ($5)  FIRST Hummus w/ Tahini: A nice version of hummus; nothing special though. The bread served in the paper bag was nice - it was a type of flat bread with, I believe, Za'atar seasoning.  Cauliflower w/ Vadouvan, Cashews: This was my least favorite dish. The cauliflower was cooked well in their wood-burning oven, but I didn't care for the dish's flavor and sweetness.  Spicy Potatoes w/ Cilantro Aioli: Delicious! Fingerling potatoes cooked in the wood-burning oven with a spicy oil and served with complementing herby aioli.  Dolmades: Cold stuffed grape leaves served with Greek yogurt. They were fine, but nothing standout.  Spicy Cigars: Fried phyllo rolls filled with beef. Yum!! There's nothing to hate about these fried delicacies. You'll wish there were more than two.  SECOND Chopped Salad: Cucumbers, Freekeh, tomato, lemon. This was a bonus course for the typical 3-course RW menu. A very generous bowl of tasty and refreshing salad. Although great by itself, it was also fantastic with other dishes.  THIRD Chicken Tagine: Preserved lemon, olives, almonds; served on saffron rice. The chicken was flavorful and moist. Solid dish.  Kebab Plate w/ Saffron Rice (Lamb Kefta, Longanisa, Butifarra): The lamb kebab was tasty and served with a spicy paste-like sauce. The sausages were fantastic. My favorite was the Butifarra; described as a salami sausage, it's very flavorful with a subtle kick of spice. One of my favorite sausages is Linguica and Longanisa is supposed to be very similar, but I disagree. It's described as a chorizo-like sausage and that's exactly how it tasted. Either way, still good, but not my type of sausage. The saffron rice with visible stands of the coveted saffron was delicious. There was also a small dish of pickled vegetables that went well with the kebabs.  FOURTH Greek Yogurt & Fresh Berries: Earl Grey and Orange Blossom tea, macerated berries. The menu doesn't state that the yogurt is actually a sorbet and that was pleasant surprise. It was great with the tasty raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries and the fragrant tea.  Baklava: There were two pieces of traditional baklava and another two pieces of chocolate baklava. Both were really fantastic. Nice layers and it wasn't too sweet or dense.  We also ordered Falafel ($9) and they were very good. Crispy exteriors with a delicious, moist interior. It also came on a bed of Tabbouleh and Tahini. I would seriously go back for this alone.  Service was truly wonderful. We never had to flag anyone down for anything because what we needed was in front of us before we actually needed it. The restaurant was beautiful. Also, it was very comfortable in terms of temperature. It's hard to find a restaurant that's nice and cold during our sweltering summers. Either way, Cleo is serving up delicious Mediterranean food in a really sexy setting. Great for date nights or special occasions!",

Giving it 3 stars because no restaurant should be serving dishes with such a high level of sodium.   Way too much.  I did not eat much as I felt I would have had heart failure from all the sodium.  If you don't have a heart condition like me, you can get away with it but it's such an unhealthy way to prepare food.  If it was legit Mediterranean cuisine, it would not be so loaded up with salt.  If there was one dish to order, or the Brussels sprouts from the fire grill.  Insanely good.  Crispy and flavourful.  That's what kept me from giving it 2 stars.   Decor is cool.  Don't understand the link to the type of cuisine, but it's a cool spot.   Would I go back? Yes, but would order hummus and an order of those Brussels sprouts.... a double batch.",

    "text": "Came here to celebrate an early bday dinner for my dad, when we arrived there was no wait so we got seated fairly quick and they even gave us a private dining room.   The food here is seriously out of this world !! They do Mediterranean styled tapas here so I recommend each person ordering 2-3 plates and then everyone sharing family style.   Everything was seriously a 5/5 no joke. But here are the things we ordered :  Cucumbers & Yogurt - Kind of a tarty yogurt dip with fresh cucumbers and super fresh hot flatbread for you to dip it in  Brussels Sprout Hearts, Hazelnuts - Super delicious, they were cooked perfectly still crunchy but soft  Tuna Tartare - TO DIE FOR !! The tuna was soo soft and fresh it just melted in your mouth. My dad (who is not a raw fish eater even loved it)  Spinach & Ricotta Dumplings - Yummy balls of goodness, it was more ricotta tasting than spinach but good none the less, and the creamy pesto sauce it was drenched in was cleaned off the plate   Roast Lamb - So tender and juicy and cooked a perfect medium rare. Not all places serve good lamb but Cleo definitely has got it down, it also comes served on a bed of couscous  Merguez - It doesn't say in the description on the menu but it has slices of lamb \"pepperoni\" if you will and is accompanied with onions, peppers and mozzarella, really good flatbread   Scallops - Melts in your mouth and when it was gone I wanted more ):   Garlic Shrimp - The sauce is what makes the dish !   From now on every time I come to Vegas I'll be making a stop here too",

    "text": "So I've been on a major Mediterranean kick; the food is plentiful and healthy- what more can you ask for?   We've dined at Cleo twice once in the beginning of the year and once last month.  Funny enough we saw our server from our first experience, although she wasn't our sever the second time, and she actually remembered us; pretty neat!  We remembered her too because she was super friendly, chill and easy to talk to- that is always nice when that happens.  Cleo is my dream restaurant, literally if I could pick any restaurant in the world and relocate it to the Bay Area, this is it. I know we have Kokkari but I HEART Cleo!  The decor is exactly my style; slightly bohemian with touches of a 90 year old grandma and the casual yet elegant ambiance we want in a Vegas dining experience.  I don't consider this a pricey meal by Vegas standards, you can come in and try a bunch of small dishes.  Must Try List:  Brussels Sprouts: I have tried to mimic these at home to no avail. They are a must eat, next time I think I'll order one for myself.  Kabobs: We ordered several orders of the Waygu, all the various meats were good but that was the best. Super tender, and a generous portion.  Moussakah: YUM best mousakkah I've ever had, except its super filling and LOADED w cheese. I know that's what you get w a mousakkah but be warned, it will leave you full.  Lamb Shawarma: Easily the #2 favorite thing behind the Sprouts, this was delicious and nothing like what I thought it'd be. I'm not huge into lamb but always order it at finer dining locations, I think this could be the best I've had. Portion is tiny if you have a few meat eaters.  Grilled Octopus: Ignore everything I just said the grilled octopus was REALLY my favorite thing behind the sprouts. OMG I think about this all the time. The texture is unreal, super duper soft and not at all your typical octopus. It's charred to perfection, you won't find a dish like this elsewhere.  Halloumi salad is tasty too!",

    "text": "- I liked the space.  Not too loud - I didn't like the booth that they gave to us.  A booth for seven?  Very cramped - Service was friendly.  A little pushy with food recommendations, but not overbearing  The food:  - The octopus was the most tender octopus I've ever had.  The flavor was a little weird though.  Just wasn't my thing.  Too curryish (and I love curry) - The mushrooms were very nice.  Meaty and sweet - The foie gras pate was smooth, buttery, sweet.  Mmmmm - The venison sausage was too sweet and not gamey enough - Of the three dips we had (labaneh, hummus, carrot something), only the hummus was good.  The other two were much too bland or much too carroty - The brussels sprouts had great flavor, but were too greasy - The spicy cigars were a great start.  Enjoyed the crunch and the taste of the herbs in the meat - The bone marrow was ok.  Great presentation, but the mushrooms didn't seem to mesh well - The panna cotta dessert was delicious.  Creamy, smooth, just the right amount of sweet and the figs were excellent  Loved the small plates concept.  Was a little disappointed in some of the food.",

    "text": "I was invited to dine at Cleo at the all new SLS Hotel & Casino. I didn't know what to expect having known that the property was the former Sahara H&C. Walking into the restaurant I felt like I was walking into a magazine. Everyone from the hosts to the servers were stunning, tall and extravagant. The restaurant has \"Trend\" down to the letter.   The second we sat down I took in the atmosphere and reveled in the old meets new aspects of the decor, from the beautiful Victorian styled chandeliers to the individualized plates that threw back memories of grandma's fine china cabinet.   We were there on a pre-fixed menu which was fine, but what was a bit unusual was the fact that I didn't have a choice in what was served to me. Granted, all the food that was presented to us was extraordinary but if I happened to be a vegetarian, vegan or just didn't like Chicken I would not have been able to enjoy my meal.  That being said, the Hummus was delectable and flavorful, the Brussel Sprouts was unlike anything I ever had before (and I don't really care for BS), but what was really impressive was their Flatbread. It was definitely worth the meal.  They served us a drink called the 'Vineburry' which took my by surprise. At first it looks gentle enough until you take your first sip. Be warned, this drink is not for the faint of heart. It is infused with Serrano Chili's and therefore has a very strong KICK to it. If you're not into spicy drinks then this is not the one for you.  All-in-all this was an experience worth the effort. If you are staying anywhere near the SLS and looking for an exciting dining affair then you will not be dissappointed.",

    "text": "My wife and I visited last night (Friday) before the show at the SLS. It was restaurant week and they had a special menu. My wife also added the wine flight. While waiting for our first course, I read the main menu and noticed that the wine flight \"special\" for restaurant week actually cost more than if we had bought it from the main menu. Plus, you had to accept the wines they chose - all house wines.   We learned from the hostess that there was also a spring menu that was even less expensive than the restaurant menu. She said she would bring it over but she never did.   Service timing was off all night. My first two courses came out together. My wife's first course came out alone. My wife's second course came out fifteen minutes later. Since I had finished my first two courses, I waited half an hour for my next course. I ordered the flank steak. Chicken was delivered to me. The manager said he would check with our waitress. Both the manager and the waitress passed our table twice again without comment. Ten minutes later, my steak was delivered. My wife was about finished with her meal by then.   The Restaurant Week menu came with dessert. Thirty minutes after our entree dishes were cleared away we asked our waitress what the hold-up was on dessert. She said the tortes would be right out. Ten minutes later, we asked the manager. Ten minutes after that, dessert arrived. The wine flight included coffee. So, my wife was given coffee. I was not asked if I would also like coffee or an after dinner drink.   During the time we were waiting for dessert, the manager stopped by to thank us for dining there. He acted like we were ready to leave. We reminded him we were waiting for dessert. He hurried off never to be seen again.  The restaurant was not busy at all. But, all through the meal, our waitress never smiled once. She told us once she thought it was going to be a long night.   There are a lot of places to eat on the Vegas strip. Cleo will not be a repeat.",

    "text": "Yum! This was a solid 4.5 review, but just wasn't in the amazing 5 category. We were at the SLS for the nigjt and didn't want to venture in the heat. Among the options at the hotel, this was the clear winner on Yelp so we decided to give it a try. Even my skeptical BF was happy! Service and ambiance were great. It's tapas style, so we got the hummus to start, the Brussels sprouts hearts, falafel, lamb Sharma, lamb tangine. The falafel and hummus were both awesome, and BF liked the schwarma and tangine (portions were generous although the lamb wasn't as tender as it could have been on the tangine). The Brussels sprouts were the only dish I could have gone without as they were just too salty with the sauce they use. But overall, excellent!",

What a great way to try different types of food by offering it as a tapas style dining experience. We started off with hummus and baba ghanouj or eggplant dip, their bread is awesome! We then added raw lamb, (kind of like sushi of the Middle East) bone marrow, lamb and beef kebabs along with a Greek salad and dessert. Everything was fantastic, cooked to perfection, go now as it was not crowded and people are not aware of this fantastic dining experience at the SLS casino and hotel.  Ok, we are back! My son was with us and he loved it too!!! Very crowded tonight! Greek coffee and toffee bread pudding for dessert, yum!!!",

I can't say anything blew me away and I'm not much of a foodie, but we decided to try it. It's Mediterranean and tapas style so we ordered 4 or 5 different items.  To say I was blown away is an understatement. The service was amazing.. The food was beyond amazing, with some items smelling better than anything I've ever sniffed.  I'm a local in LV and am so happy we found this spot. Will I be back? Oh ya!",

    "text": "The carrot harissa is made for a sour loving Persian palate, so keep that in mind. It may not be exactly what you want, but if is a good example of how the restaurant does not aim the food at a common denominator tourist, thereby ruining any chances at an exceptional experience.     This place ends up being cheaper than you'd expect. A group of four was well fed for about 90 when we thought the bill would be 120.  Everything was well made. I would suggest ordering half of what you want, starting on that half, and then ordering the next half. I was going to write something about how you should keep in mind the order for yourself b/c they just bring things out as they're finished. On second thought, there is no reason to worry about your plates clashing with each other, just enjoy the food.",

    "text": "This large Mediterranean restaurant has received rave reviews since opening. Located in the middle of the restaurant is an open kitchen dominated by a wood burning oven.  We started off with an order of lebaneh (Lebanese yogurt cheese) with feta that was served with fresh baked laffa bread that we could not stop eating. This order also included eggplant, fennel and chili prepared in the oven.  Next we requested chicken kabobs, spanokipita and lamb tagine with couscous. The chicken was well seasoned, moist and the best we have ever experienced. Though the spanokipita was on the petite size given its price tag, it too was delicious. We were a little less thrilled by the lamb tagine with apricots, silan, sesame seeds over couscous principally because the couscous was bit on the dry side.",

    "text": "When we went, there were only about 90 reviews on Yelp. I asked the hostess and I guess they had only opened two months prior. Their biggest problem, as expertly noticed by my ex-waiter fiance, was the inxperienced system. The hostess was running around doing some of duties that I think runners typically have. Once we were sat, we were ignored for a while. I don't blame them. They were far too busy and there were far too few servers... but it was 7pm and in Vegas, attention to detail is everything.  -1 star  The food, however, was largely delicious! Get the kale bread. We expected something bitter, but the creme fraiche made it sweet and savory. It might be the best thing we had that night. We also loved the falafel, but be warned: they are bite-sized. The hummus was great. I was looking forward to the babaganoush but it tasted plain. Nothing to write home about~more cheese than eggplant.  Definitely go, but at not at peak hours until they get into the groove of things.",

    "text": "Cleo's at SLS Las Vegas 2535 Las Vegas Blvd South, Las Vegas, NV 89109  I've tried all the SLS restaurants and came away disappointed by most, but Cleo's is their shining star.  I say this surprising myself, because I don't really like Mediterranean food.  We chose it because my son wanted to try it.  Or I should say - I never liked it before.  I have to say that the service and food has been overall disappointing in many of the SLS restaurants with the exception of CLEO'S and Ku Noodles.  Our night at Cleo's was fabulous, almost a complete five stars across the board.   SERVICE:  The service was, hands down, the best service I have had at a SLS or any Las Vegas restaurant in a very long time.  Most restaurants are hiring young, perky, pretty totally inept servers ... but Cleo's workers from hostess to busboy to server were just the BEST.  My beverage glasses were never below half before refilled.  We were checked on numerous times, food arrived fast and in a very timely manner and it was the right temperature.  The servers were attentive without being bothersome.  Wow.  Kudos to the entire staff for actually training and using the best servers.  They made our experience exceptional.  FOOD:  We ordered coffee and water to drink.  We changed from sugary beverages to water with lemon as a healthy step, and added coffee as a treat.  Some servers give you a cheap look when you order water, but not here, and it came with a side dish of lemons.  Nice!  The coffee was absolutely delicious.  It was strong but not bitter and very tasty.  We had appetizers which included Lebaneh with Feta (a dip for $9) and I think it's called laffa bread which comes with it.  I though $9 was high for dip, but not for this one!  The bread came in a paper bag, nice and warm, and the best bread I've ever tasted.  I could have made a meal out of just bread and dip.  The dip was feta cheese with a vinegarette tastiness, sooo good, we practically fought over it.  We'll order it every visit.  We also ordered Spanikopita ($9), which was three triangle shaped crisp dough tapas.  I didn't care for these but I'm sure they were made right.  My son really liked them.  We also ordered the Brussels Sprouts ($12) which was charred with capers, almonds and vinegarette (similar to the Sprouts at Katsayu next door).  They are absolutely delicious and I'll order them every visit.  For our main course I order the lamb kabobs ($14) which was three small perfectly cooked tender lamb chops with sauce.  My son order the Seasonal Flatbread ($14) with gruyere cheese, chili and arugula.  The lamb was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Neither of us liked the flatbread.  The flavor was just okay, and the bread was a little burnt and over crispy.  But that might be the way it comes .. other people have commented that it is very good.  For dessert we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($9) which didn't seem like a pudding at all.  It was a warm chocolate cake with cold scoop of ice cream in a shallow dish with a little caramel like dripping in the bottom.  It was delicious, just not what we expected.  AMBIANCE:  The restaurant has a beautiful layout and decorations.  However, we found the tables, especially those for just two people, to be very small.  There was barely room for a plate each, let alone a couple of appetizers with drinks.  And it was so loud in the restaurant that we almost had to shout to share comments about the food.  Some of the noise came from the music, but the rest was from people around us just being very, very loud and boisterous.  Maybe that's part of the Mediterranean personality.  SCORE: Service ... 5 stars Food ... 5 stars Ambiance ... 3 stars The total for our meal for two people was $84.",

    "text": "I am not sure what all the great reviews are about. This place is barely mediocre. The service included.  The falafel, though crispy on the outside, was way too dense on the inside. The little salad with it was better than the actual falafel. Grilled Eggplant was pretty bland. Tender yes, but not seasoned. Again the fennel was better than the eggplant.  Lamb Tartar was pretty tasty. Good flavors and not too gamey.  House Pickles? Um, I guess pickled things are all pickles? Because it was just picked carrots, celery and cauliflower..strange, way too spicy and just doesn't work at all.  Chicken Tagine was fine. I liked the rice more than the chicken. It was buttery and delicious, while the chicken was pretty plain and bland.  I would say the worst dish of the night was the grilled octopus. Very small dish, tasted very bland and not charred. Once again I I enjoyed the garnishes more than the actual star of the dish, which seemed like a pattern throughout the meal.  Scallops, ok so at least you can't mess that up right? No, they weren't seared correctly, so were pretty rubbery and the mistakes were very visible on the plate by anyone who spent more than a few weeks learning any cooking techniques.  Fig and almond panacotta was actually promising, with delicate custard and sweet figs, but then the sauce on top was just unreduced alcohol based sauce which took over the whole thing. This was the first time in a long neither me nor my gf finished a desert. Sauce on top was awful.  Service was ok, but it was my gf's birthday and they knew in advance, but nobody said anything. She was kind of upset, and that alone probably deserves a one star rating. The atmosphere and decor brings it barely up to 2 stars.  Overall very very disappointing.",

The chef at Cleo does an amazing job of rolling three or four distinct profiles in every dish. Hummus -  fantastic creaminess with a hint of cumin Spicy Cigars - crispy filo wrapped around a finely textured wagyu beef Shrimp Kabob - perfectly cooked slightly sweet shrimp  Brussels Sprouts - flash fried leafs in a lemony brine  Lamb Tartare - fresh mild lamb  Hangar Steak and crispy potatoes - so tender with a bold beefy profile  Service - As good as I have had on the strip.  Our server Ricardo was  attentive and knowledgeable. His food descriptions were spot on he knows hi menu!  The house manager was also friendly.

I was very impressed with the food, every ingredient had a reason for being in that dish. Between two people, we ordered 6 dishes and I was stuffed to capacity. The mushrooms with dates and nuts were insane. My watermelon salad is something to remember for life and the rice under the chicken tagine took me on a trip to Morocco just by it's fragrance. I had to force myself to order dessert because when in Rome... Awesome cocktail and beer list. Try the grapefruit beer! Absolutely yummy! Our server, Ricardo made sure to explain everything on our menu to the last detail and never left us hanging. Excellent service, we were always attended to. Meat lovers and vegetarians could happily dine here together. I appreciated how the manager came around to hear our feedback and I could not fault one dish. My only gripe was we sat at a table right under an aircon vent but that is minor compared to the whole picture and that there is only 3 oysters in a serving which makes it hard to share. Overall, a lot of creativity went into the menu and I appreciated it. Kudos for churning out top quality dishes plate after plate. Just perfect. And I can't wait to go there again.",

    "text": "Just not a big fan of food on the Vegas Strip - too fancy, too pretentious and of course too expensive.  Cleo is an exception to the rules.  Located in the SLS Hotel (formerly the Sahara) in the DMZ between the Strip and Fremont Street, this restaurant did turn out to be a rather pleasant surprise.  And Eastern Mediterranean tapas (Greek, Lebanese, Turkish) is a very nice break from the norm, so a welcome change of tastes.  Small plates which our server recommended four per person to start.  And with five diners - a lot of sampling was going on.  The menu is a bit limited, but enough to choose from and have a well rounded sampling of the cuisines.  Standouts included - a delicious Babaganoush, really good hummus with tahini, the Lebabeh, yogurt, spankopita - all very good.  A variety of bold but not overwhelming flavors and spices that complimented but did not battle each other.  One other standout - the potato latkes - I like a good latke, these were really good.    A nice Harira soup - great tomato base with lentils and veggies and a decent Greek salad.  And really good bread for dipping - fresh and hot.  Only disappointment - the falafel.  Dry, kind of bland, Just not at the same level as all the other dishes we had. Odd.    A word of advice - order no more than three plates per person to start,  You can always add on as you go and not wonder where all this food is coming from and why it keeps coming to the table.",

That's the real stand out. The quality and tastes are amazing, the mix of spices and herbs is extremely unique. We have taken several other people to this restaurant in all of them have also raved about the quality and taste of the food.  5 to 7 plates are filling for two individuals. The downside is the price, which tends to run a little bit on the high side. However, with the code, locals can enjoy a 50% off from now through December 23. We have taken advantage of this deal several times and will be sad to see it go.  They also have a gluten-free and vegan menu.",

I was surprised that it hadn't come up in previous searches given its rave reviews. I knew I had to try it. My friend and I already had dinner plans , so we came to Cleo to try an appetizer and a dessert close to closing time. We had an amazing waitress who was friendly and gave great advice on what to order. We ended up getting the eggplant moussaka and the sticky toffee pudding. The eggplant moussaka was like heaven! The eggplant was tender, beautifully cooked. It had a good balance of richness from the cheese and acidity from the tomato sauce. This isn't the type of dish I would typically order, but this dish inspired me to try moussaka again. The dessert was also on point, but maybe not quite as good as the eggplant. The sticky toffee pudding was served warm with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and a tasty sauce on the bottom of the plate. The next time I'm in Vegas I would like to try a full meal at this restaurant. It was definitely worth the somewhat high price point.",

The hummus and the falafel were standouts, as were the wagyu beef, chicken and shrimp kababs. Our server, Lindsay was wonderful: professional, knowledgeable, warm and personable.

First it's almost impossible to find good authentic legit spots on the Las Vegas strip for exotic cuisines- hispanic, Asian middle eastern, etc. If you want one, go off the strip.   second A place that proudly serves \"Middle eastern\" and also \"Greek\" food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion.   And yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good!  The lamb shawarma was also good. And branzino fish with labaneh was on point.   Even though our hostess did a terrible job, our server was lovely.   So bottom line. Worth visiting. A solid 4 stars spot.  Trust me. I know food.",

Unfortunately there were only 3 dolmatas and 4 of us. Seems weird to have an odd number of them.  For sides we ordered the roasted beet salad and brussels sprouts-both were great. The main courses were the Chicken Tagine, scallops, and a shrimp dish. All were excellent. Everything tasted fresh and unique. The chicken on the bone and it made it hard to share. There were also only 3 scallops for $26.00. Since the concept of tapas is to share, then it would be great if the numbers were even and the chicken cut up off the bone to facilitate sharing.  We all ordered cocktails, each of us ordered something different. While all were tasty, they seemed really light on the alcohol. At $15.00 a drink ($20 when you add on tax and tip), a more generous poor would have been nice. The service was very good, almost a little too good as the servers were ready to whisk away the dishes before we were done dipping bread in the wonderful remnants at the bottom. Overall I'd give the food quality 5 stars, only marked down for ease of sharing dishes intended to be divided up.",

Not sure I like being hustled while having dinner.   There was definitely alot of tight dresses barely covering fake parts on some of the customers dining at the restaurant. Big hair and lots of makeup seems to be the norm here also.   Ok meal, probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

Probably one the few restaurant s in its class that lets you book for free without putting hundreds of dollars even before you get there. They are more of a small plate restaurant with amazing flavors. The serving size is excellent for sharing, we ordered the spiced potatoes, the chicken tagine, the roast lamb and everything was on point. No long wait the ambience is incredible we didn't try the cocktails but did go for the dessert. Sticky toffee pudding highly recommended!",

We are a big fan of tapas-style dining and Mediterranean food, and this place exceeded expectations. We ordered hummus, babaganoush, falafel, marinated olives, Brussels sprouts, a quinoa and vegetable salad, and cauliflower. Everything was absolutely superb and we thought it was one of the best meals that we have ever had in Vegas. The service and look of the restaurant also made the experience top-notch. We also thought that the meal was a shockingly good value. I would highly recommend Cleo to anyone who likes Mediterranean food.",

Here's what I remember:  Wagyu kebabs - really good! lamb sliders Brussel sprouts pork belly - really well done! It melted in my mouth. hummus spinach dumplings - these things were incredible! Possibly my favorite of the night! Plus I am sure a couple of more things.  Really everything was delicious. Towards the end we couldn't do anymore and left a couple of things on the table...but really every single dish had a great presentation and tasted fantastic.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated with the kitchen right in the middle (with a really cool smoke stack/oven (?) running right up the middle of it and into the roof.  Granted...It is a little pricey, but considering it's inside of a resort - and the quality is great - you expect it to be a little pricey.",

It's about the explosion of lots of different flavors and textures.  Had the pleasure of dining with three others, so we were able to order two of the fixed-price menu items which came with lots of different dishes.  The grilled octopus was amazing - not rubbery like octo can be - delicate, flavorful and delicious!  We sample meats - grilled hangar steak and roast lamb...mmm.  Enjoyed different salads - watermelon salad was a hit!  The mushroom flatbread (think thin crust pizza) was INCREDIBLE!  Seriously, the meal was excellent!  Other than the restaurant being very busy and loud, the service was efficient and friendly, the decor warm and inviting - Cleo scored big-time in my book.  5 stars, can't wait to return!",

Our server was soooo friendly and amazing (I really wish I could remember his name!). He was so patient and helpful with answering any questions we had. Food was fantastic, and the small portions were surprisingly filling. Kebobs were amazing, rice was perfectly cooked, and the Lebanah appetizer dish was perfect.   I'm half Lebanese and was familiar with the Middle Eastern dishes on the menu. I saw Kibbeh Nayeh (what they call \"lamb tartare\") on the menu before going and was craving it soooo much. However, it wasn't as authentic or tasted as I'd hoped, but still ok! They basically took the traditional dish and gave it an upscale twist. The crackers that it came with had a huge spice kick, so I ate it with the pita that was served with our Lebaneh. If it's your first time trying a raw meat dish (like my boyfriend), its great!  Overall, I'd definitely recommend for the service and the quality that you experience while dining here. Very worth it!",

My other friend got a drink named lotus something and she was very happy with her drink. It is worth mentioning that our waitress came in checking on our drink. Probably if we have told her we are not enjoying it she would have changed them. But we were too tired and too shy. We ordered five different tapas from the menu. Lamb kebob, shrimp kebob, and lamb kefta and none of them were really good. Falafel was bland and tasteless. The only good thing was mushroom flat bread. This one was really good.

It is important to state that even though we made reservations - once we were seated the service was impeccable. We received our food quick and perfectly presented. We frequent the SLS Hotel and we will definitely be back!",

Our appetizers and food as the pic that came out in due time and we're all great. Portion sizes were very small so we had to order a lot to be satisfied. Pricing is not cheap but worth the quality.

It turned out to be awesome. There is an artsy black and white Cleopatra picture outside the restaurant. Beauty of the restaurant starts here. The interiors were fab.  The unique thing about this place is - Though its a high end restaurant, they serve decent quantity plates for reasonable prices. So you can try many dishes with no worry of shelling out lots of money.   Every dish we ordered was top notch. Chicken Tagine was the best. The rice in it was so full of favours that I might go to Vegas just to have this again. Moussakah was another gem. You got to try these both here. Hummus and Peta were so different from other Mediterranean places we have been to.   This is going to be a tradition for us to visit this place whenever we go to Vegas",

Decor is great, Classic blue Chevron tile floor, colorful plates and pottery  chairs at bar as well as at the tables are not comfortable for bigger people.  The chairs around the dining kitchen are great.  Bar staff was great had one of their signature cocktails, the Adriatic Fresh and it was great.  In the dining area, the lighting was a bit too dim for me and the space got very loud at times with boisterous celebrations from a few tables, but it's Vegas and anything can happen anywhere.  Cleo is a tapas concept so we ordered a bunch of stuff...the stand out was the Chicken Liver dip, the Garlic Shrimp, and the Harira Soup.  Everything had great flavor and was well prepared.  There similar and less expensive options off the strip, but for the single serving experiences the strip offers, this is a great addition The Strip.",

    "text": "We decided to give Cleo a second try based on the recommendation of our friends who come here fairly often. Also, we got the Travel Zoo \"deal\" for a 3 course price-fixed menu for the bargain price of $55 for 2. For those who don't read to the end of the review, I will start by telling you NOT to get the Travel Zoo coupon. You save about $5 to $10 a couple but are stuck with a very limited menu to chose from. Not worth it!! We started with the hummus. My wife thought it was pretty good, my vote was meh. Before we were half way through the hummus, they brought our salads to the table. What was the rush?? The table is small and already crowded. Why bring one course on top of the last? The server told us they bring the food out as it is ready. Really? Makes you feel rushed. An OK policy for Dennys, shouldn't be for a high end restaurant. And the restaurant was less than half full. No need to push us out that fast. My wife had the Greek Salad and thought it was good. I had a chopped salad. Meh at best. Left over a good part of it. Next we had the chicken kabob. The chicken was moist, but bland. It was OK, but nothing special. Next we shared the \"giant\" shrimp in garlic sauce. Yes, \"giant\" shrimp is an oxymoron. But this really wasn't since these were the smallest \"giant\" shrimp I have ever been served. Their consistency wasn't good, they were chewy, and the garlic sauce was bland. We left over half. Finally came the mushroom flat bread. This was the highlight of the meal. It was above average. Not good, but a little better than OK. Considering the price, not a good value. The service was fair. It's hard to feel good about the service when you feel the food is being rushed. The manager did come by to find out how we liked the meal. When I told him, he offered to comp a dessert and coffee. We took a pass. I just wanted to go home. I won't be back.",

I called the day after I recovered and the manager was kind and said he would report it to Risk Management and get back to me.  No follow up, so I will be calling the health department myself.",

Everything was so delicious! We ordered Babaghanoush and Labneh with Feta with veggie sticks. Also the Lamb Shawarma, Longanisa sausage, and Quinoa salad with Roasted Vegetables. My boyfriend who is Lebanese and familiar with real authentic Mediterranean foods said that Cleo tasted like Lebanon to him (that's a great compliment!)  Thank you Cleo, we will be back!!! Your service was great too! All the staff were friendly and nice. Our server was very knowledgeable. It was a great dining experience!!!",

We were seated at one of the more private tables, just to the side of the front entrance. I was happily surprised not to be distracted by the noise of the casino. The room itself was comfortable with thick velvet curtains and an awesome chandelier. Everyone at the table also loved the eclectic plates you dine from.  Service was great from start to finish. The chicken kabobs, falafel, spanakopita,  Dolmades, clams, tuna tartare, squid, cous cous soup and everything else we had was delicious. We ate everything plus dessert! Our bill was just under $200 ( before tip) for six of us! We didn't drink any alcohol though... I can't wait to dine here again but my husband wants to try Bizarre Meats first!  Cleo is obviously great for groups since it is Mediterranean tapas. I'm coming back here for my next birthday dinner!",

Lebneh with Feta appetizer, Tabouleh and Lamb Tagine. The funny thing is that menu isn't what you would call traditional Mediterranean cuisine, and the palette I'd call rather bold. At any rate, dishes are very delicious and definitely worth the try.  A bit loud, but I'm not gonna take a star away for that. Some people tend to like noisy restaurants.",

In my reservation on OpenTable and when I entered the restaurant and when we talk to the waitress we told her multiple times about our food allergies. But somehow she failed to connect that with the chefs.  Two of the dishes we received had our allergies and  one was actually eaten. We had to write an incident report with the SLS and the manager had to handle the situation because the waitress was unable to. She couldn't even list the ingredients that were in many of the food that we ordered.  The busboys knew more then her.   On the slightly positive note about the restaurant some of the dishes we ate were very good. The shwarma  was excellent and so were the kebabs. We did not receive most of our dishes because after almost eating a pinenut  that would've killed me I wasn't really that hungry.  The management and busboys were excellent in handling the situation. The waitress was an epic fail. I would go back and try the restaurant again but I would make sure that my waitress truly understands what might kill me in my food.",

Food was good although not exceptional where any one items is a \"must have.\"  We had an array of items including quinoa salad (great flavor), brussel sprouts, meatball tangine, lamb kefta, and dolmades. Flavors were good and all tasted like they use fresh ingredients.  The dessert probably was the best flavor and consistency - the Fig and Almond Panna Cotta with Amaretto.  They have some nice private tables where you can draw the curtains and service was very attentive.  The highlight of our meal was Patrick, our server.  He knew the drink and food menu inside and out, offering some great suggestions and engaging all of his tables.  Often, you get servers who just mindlessly repeat what they are told and don't have the ability to ad lib or give insightful suggestions.  I would highly suggest that you request him and would definitely ask for him again. The busser, Nick, never let an empty plate sit more than a minute and was there to constantly fill water.  The manager even stopped by to check on us, which is also not something you see except in fine dining.  For service alone, I would make a return trip.  Highlights:   *Great vegetarian options *Prompt service and knowledgeable staff *Good portion sizes *Reservations recommended *Easy to get in and out",

Hits: Cucumber & Yogurt dip with fresh baked flatbread.  Lamb Tagine / Tender chunks of slow braised lamb served over a sweet couscous.  OK... This is without a doubt the best thing on the menu... Brussels Sprouts that have been flashed fried with Garlic. They taste like potato chips. I am not joking these things are very addictive.   Price for the sharable apps run $7-10 Same on sides.  Most expensive Tagine ran $16 for the lamb, most of the tagine hover around the $13 mark. If you go and share with a group you will not leave hungry.",

The food is divine and the restaurant decor is fun with the spices on the counter and the books on the shelves. There are also fun private rooms with curtains for bigger groups. It's tapas style so its fun to order a few things and share.  When we went they were doing a $29 dollar three item special so we did that for one person and then added a few things on. The prices for the portions and quality was fantastic. Here is what we got and I recommend ALL of it and more:-) We were stuffed so you could probably order a little less for two people.  1. The salt and vinegar Brussel sprouts-These were amazing, they literally tasted like salt and vinegar chips and they were Brussel sprouts which is crazy. There are almonds as well. We got it without the chili pepper. The texture and taste was ridiculous, we have never had anything like it. These ain't your mother's Brussel sprouts.  2. Greek salad-the best one I have ever had. Fresh big chunks of feta with herbs, slices of cucumbers, fresh tomato, great Kalamata olives, and a wonderful dressing. Tasted so fresh and clean, even better than the one I had on the beaches of Greece. I got it without onions. 3. Lamb-The lamb was fantastic. I don't even eat or like lamb, I always think of the baby lambs in the manger scene and can't do it but this was worth it. It came with a wonderful couscous as well that complimented the flavor. 4. Cucumber and dill dip-I LOVE dips like this and this was amazing. It was a greek yogurt base with fresh dill and cucumbers in it with fresh falafel bread served from the wood burning oven. I would order it without the pepper corns next time. 5.  Chicken Skewer-The flavor and texture were wonderful.  6. Fig Panna Cotta-this dessert was fabulous. Light but rich at the same time with wonderful fresh figs and almond clusters.  7. Excellent french press coffee. They also have a green coffee. 8. The Lotus flower cocktail is to die for.   All and All this is the best restaurant I have eaten at in a long time and maybe ever. Run Run Run to Cleo and get your walk like an Egyptian on.",

    "text": "Went here for a quick dinner while visiting Vegas last weekend. Saw all the reviews on yelp and figured we had to try it.... WOW.... These reviews are LEGIT.... Everything we had was top notch... Hummus was amazing (wish they gave you 2 pieces of the nahn bread). Everything we had was really good.. Grilled octopus was the best... Service was A+ through the while meal and not just by the server but by everyone there!!! Not much else to say except try it.... You won't be disappointed. Me and my wife will be headed the the Santa Monica location cause it's closer to San Diego ..... Hope they live up to what we had in Vegas!",

The octopus was surprisingly tender. The vegetarian dishes were so full of flavor that they weren't even missing meat. I will definitely be going back.",
