Share some Sake with the chef, they love to have fun too ! I can't complain about the 2-4-1 house Sake they are offering now.  Friday nights are packed. The Tuna Karai is excellent.",

I got some friends together (6 of us total) and went down to Henderson to give this place a shot. First off, the menu has photos, that's awesome! Makes me picking my sushi so much easier. We all started off with some warm saki and a few appetizers. When it came to the dinner, we all each, ordered 2 different rolls and just shared. My favorite was the Cherry Blossom, it was AMAZING! After we stuffed our faces with over 12 different rolls, we found out we were still $6 short of our $200 tab. I couldn't believe all of that was still under $200. So at the end, our bill was $144 with the gratuity that is added b/c of the gift certificate. So with that, we got 4 apps, 6 sake's, 6 sappora's, and 12 rolls. Great deal!",

    "text": "I've been here a number of times, but one day I decided I had a long day at work doing morning shift and wanted to wind down here for lunch.  I sat at the sushi bar and I was familiar with the staff, my old sushi chef from Yama Sushi was now here (surprise surprise) making my rolls.  I adore the Family Roll and the Leo Ball. The Mochi here is also excellent.  My previous experiences were all good. I had gone with a friend once and they had a super spicy roll. The waitress noticed they were having a hard time with how spicy it was, so she brought us FREE mochi ice cream.  I was expecting good service and good sushi. Few people were in there as it was lunchtime and a weekday.  Regardless of there being multiple sushi chefs and very few customers (4 at most), my rolls weren't made very well and they took a while to arrive, even with help. My drink was constantly empty. And the worst part (and this is why I haven't returned since and didn't give 4-5 stars...), I WAITED OVER AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES FOR MY CHECK. I must have asked for it in 10 different ways 20 different times to 5 different people...  I was at a loss. I wanted to dine and dash so badly, but I'm not like that. And hell, I haven't even gone back - so maybe I should have.  That was the most ridiculous experience ever and I turn the other way now and go to Sapporo down the street.  BUT...I was told that the head sushi chef here is willing to teach women how to make sushi. I don't know of anywhere else that is, and the sushi chefs here always tell me women weren't taught how to make sushi for the longest time. Interesting.",

The nigiri style sushi is just ok...not amazingly fresh by any means. They do have a few cool rolls to try, and that really is their only strength. The miso soup is always weak, as is the service. I can't really recommend this place, as Vegas is chalk full of better places to get your raw fish on. However, if you find yourself in the area and hungry for sushi, go ahead and stop here. It'll be \"ok\".",

    "text": "By far my favorite sushi place in town!!  I have brought visitors off the strip who have claimed their favorite places cant be matched and they've admittedly stood corrected.This place doesn't overdo the fancy trendy dish presentation or ruin a perfectly good dish by trying to add their own signature flair. But they are by no means plain. All their chefs and waitresses are approachable and friendly when you want to try something new. If the ingredients on the market don't meet their standards they take the item off the menu, so when sea urchin is available you know its the best and freshest.. We all know urchin can not enjoyably be consumed any other way. Join their mailing list for coupons.  This is where you want to bring your friend who's never had sushi before... start them with baby steps. I usually introduce people by having them try \"tara's fatti\" before the more fishier dishes. For those who don't really like fishy flavors stick to all the baked and fried rolls with the variety of sauces. Ive been a loyal customer for 6 or 8 years.  All you can eat is not a deal breaker for me, but I think that might be for some unfortunately. Not that I want to deal with them being slammed with customers all the time, but I wish them all the success they deserve!",

The sushi is really good, it's not a showy place like Kabuki, Sushi Roku, etc., and if you're an Uni person (like my bf), they don't always have Uni, but supposedly Uni is not always in season.  With that being said, I really do like Momo, you can't go wrong with any of their rolls and it is not expensive at all.  The sushi chefs are very funny and friendly too (if you sit at the bar, they will take a shot of sake with you). The Screaming Orgasm has got to be my favorite.  Oh and the sushi one isn't bad neither.",

I've been coming here for many years and the food has always been great but service is hit & miss.  Today I called in a order for 2 simple items, a Screaming O with extra sauce and a Jackpot Roll.  When I arrive, there were only 2 people dining so it wasn't busy, I pay for food and check my bag for the extra sauce I asked for.  My ticket had it on there but there was just the standard cup that always comes with the Screaming O.  I tell the waitress that I am missing it and she proceeds to tell me that the cup in there is extra.  Mind you I have been ordering this from there to go for over 10 years. Then the other waitress ask is everything ok and I show and tell her that it wasn't extra sauce and she says \"sorry\", I just stand there in shock that she is not getting my extra sauce but just looking at me. I then tell her that the service is not good and it clearly says extra sauce.  She them says you will have to pay extra for it.  I am baffled!!!! The ticket says extra sauce, you should have already charged me if there was a charge, how does it say it and you don't give it and yet have the nerve to tell me to pay more.  I just grabbed by bag and walked out.  I am sure the management will not respond or attempt to satisfy my lack of decent service. They will be loosing a longtime customer that spends and tips generously there.  Mind you I tipped the waitresses despite my frustration with them.  Step up your game Momo Sushi. There are many other choices around!!!",

It's simply irritating and detracts from an atmosphere of relaxation. I do not go to restaurants to be irritated by someone else's crappy taste in music coming out of tinny speakers.  The place was crowded. The tables are small and cramped. Very little space between tables too. Cramped enough that it was hard to find a place for our table of four to put stuff. The customers were well behaved at least.   The service was only adequate. There were too many customers for the waitresses to have to juggle, but they were pleasant and did a decent job. The menu is very extensive so at least everyone (including those that don't care for sushi) can find something they may like. The green salad with ginger dressing was the best thing I had. Generally there was nothing wrong with the food, but my impression is that the needle was pointing a little to the bland side. I think the prices are about where they normally would be for a Japanese restaurant, but I've had better values at other sushi restaurants. Generally speaking I was happy to have experienced dinner there with my spouse and friends. I recommend you give it a try at least. I think you will find it .... OK.",

On my most recent visit, for my wedding anniversary, my wife and I shared a couple of rolls, and the Momo Box, which includes teriyaki chicken, rice, 4 sushi rolls, and a few other samples. We spent under $40 on this visit. Not $40 each, but $40 total. I find the prices here to be more than reasonable, especially considering how good the food is.   I've brought several friends here, some of whom could be called sushi snobs, and I've heard nothing but praise for the quality and taste of food served here. The location on Stephanie puts Momo Sushi a quick drive from most of Henderson, and a great alternative to eating at the mall when spending an afternoon there. The ambiance is inviting, and the servers are always friendly.  Be sure to check in on Yelp to get a free dessert!",

I used to frequent another Henderson sushi restaurant until their quality went downhill (significantly) and my husband introduced me to MoMo. The Irish roll and Something Wrong are some of my favorites, and if you like crispy (fried) sushi, Tara's Fatty is one for you (read: cream cheese and shrimp). The volcano is also very good if you want more crab and less cream cheese.   The wait staff can be spotty at times, but never rude. I have only had one issue with a waitress who made my young son cry, but I have not seen her in there in a while. Anyway, if you go on a busy day (Fridays at dinner and Lunch on the weekdays seem to take the cake) then you might get less than stellar wait service if they are understaffed. However, the food more than makes up for the staffing issues in my opinion. I have been going to MoMo for about 2 years now, and highly recommend it over any other sushi restaurant in Henderson.",

I'm Japanese and can be a snob to non-Japanese owned restaurants when it comes to authenticity.  This place satisfied!  Even my picky daughter found her favorite agedashi tofu on the menu!  Prices were reasonable.  We had such a good experience there that the next night, when driving back late from Vegas, we called a to go order in and again got pleasant service.  What a good find for us on our vacation!",

Our dessert was brought before dinner was over, and the tempura ice cream tasted odd. The ice cream looked pink, and there were red dots in it.   The waitress told us it was 'vanilla'. She told me the pink was from the batter. Maybe I need to brush up on my tempura....... Because I thought it is suppose to be golden brown and delicious",

My boyfriend had ordered me a yum yum roll over the phone today and when i went to pick it up, I didnt check to make sure the order was correct (my mistake) but i assumed they had gotten in right since i was right next to him when he ordered it over the phone. When i got back to work, i realized my order was completely wrong. They gave me a salmon roll. My boyfriend called back and they told him it was a 1.50 dollar difference, but this time wouldn't let him pay over the phone (when they had JUST taken his card info over the phone on the first order) I told him it was fine and that i would just pay the difference when i got in, wasn't a big deal at all, just  weird. So when i got in, i gave them my card to pay the difference which wasn't even 2 dollars, and she told me the minimum for card transactions was 10 dollars. I had explained to her that they had messed up on my first order --which was only 6 dollars, not 10, and that i was just coming in to get the correct one and i didn't have any cash, thinking she would just let me do it on my card since they already messed up my first order. She started arguing with me and telling me i must purchase something for 10 dollars, which i wasn't going to do. Then she said she had a new waitress and that was why it happened. I said \"so because your waitress messed up, im being punished'? she then asked me if i had the original messed up order, i told her no, i wasn't asked to bring it in. she said \"well isn't it common sense?\" HAAAA. I was very nice until this moment. Isn't it common sense to get my FIRST order right??? and then be polite when i come in, out of my way, for the SECOND time to get my order??? Lady was seriously out of line. I walked out and will NEVER be back to this restaurant again.",

In short, the 2 rolls I had, the galleria and white horse were quite good and the shumai was well made but the service was poor. I was seated at the bar right away and then waited for about 10 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink. It was not at all busy. It was not even 5 pm. My shumai appetizer was forgotten so it was not provided timely. Sushi Chef was very personable but made one roll and I waited about 15 minutes or more to get the other. Huh? I eat a lot of sushi at a lot of places and they always prepare my rolls and present as a platter.   Anyway, good food poor service. Pleasant people as well.

It is NOT all you can eat but their rolls are BIG so if you are a NORMAL person, with a NORMAL stomach you will be good with 2 rolls which amounts to all you can eat anyway. Usually all the \"all you can eat\" places have tiny rolls. The employees are very nice, and on top of everything. I finished my cucumber salad and the sushi chef asked me if I wanted more. I took a long time looking at the menu and was asked like 2 times if I was ready to order. I will definitely be back again and again. This time I ordered the Triple A roll and a standard California roll. Delicious! I have also had their Volcano roll in the past and the Jennifer 2. I recommend all!",

    "text": "To end a day full of shopping with my friend, we decided to get one of my favorite meals: sushi! I'm always open to trying new sushi joints, especially if it's super close to my house! The shopping really built up an appetite for me so I was definitely looking forward to this visit.   This restaurant in the same building as Genghis Grill and the new Baby Stacks restaurants. When you walk into the location, you will notice a couple of things: it's dark and crowded! The waiting area was very small, but once you pass that, you see the sushi bar to the left, for sure a focal point as it's practically the only lit area in the restaurant. To the right was the dining area. Here's what I can say: it's crowded with tables and unnecessary decor. antlers on the walls, fake plants and vines are really outdated and don't really fit the restaurant's personality. The booths had low hanging dim lights and ours was covered in dust. Definitely needs a spring cleaning in there! Our server's name was Megun and she was definitely one with a lot of personality! I was wearing a sriracha shirt, which she noticed and started a conversation from. I really appreciated her attentiveness throughout our meal.   For our late lunch, I wanted to get a hamachi kama. The problem was they ran out of it, so I had to choose something else. Darn! I ended up getting 4 orders of the Hamachi Nigiri for $4.50 an order (2 pieces per order) and 2 orders of the tako for $4.25 per order. One thing that threw me off about this place was the fact that they didn't offer the All You Can Eat option. That meant my meal was going to be pricey for not a lot of stuff. For the food, I thought it was just alright. The hamachi was pink in color, pinker than I'm used to. Made me think if that was super fresh or just a different part of the fish. It was good though. What I did not like, however, was the fact that they put wasabi between the rice and fish. That was new and a complete surprise as it stung my nose! LOL. Be advised, you do not need wasabi in your soy sauce.  There's already wasabi in the sushi, and lots of it! The tako (octopus) was the same with the wasabi. I thought the flavor and texture was consistent with what I often times get, so no surprises there, it was very good.   For me, this was hard. When I go to restaurants looking for sushi, I'm looking to get a lot of it. To pay the same amount as I would for an All You Can Eat meal at another restaurant, I really didn't get a lot of food. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying something else, but if it's sushi, I would probably opt to go to a sushi joint with an AYCE option. Thanks Momo, though, for the experience. I appreciate it!",

Will definitely recommend and be back for more!!",

    "text": "I wanted to find something close to home and last time I had momo I enjoyed it so I decided to come back tonight. The boyfriend and I ordered 10 pieces of gyoza [he's in love with gyoza, if the restaurant has it on the menu, he's automatically ordering it]. Gyoza was alright, I would give it a 4/5. We also ordered kalbi which came with rice and miso soup and priced at $15. Kind of pricey but it was cooked quite well. Very flavorful and came on a sizzling plate like at typical Korean restaurants. For sushi we ordered salmon, kanpachi, uni, and the hooter's roll. The fresh wasabi they put on the fish has a kick to it so be careful with that. Salmon was good, but you can't usually go wrong with salmon unless it's too fishy smelling. I was a bit disappointed in their kanpachi. I usually love kanpachi but it was sliced quite thin so I could barely taste it. The uni here is always good!! I'd definitely recommend it. And the hooter's roll was like the cucumber protein roll but with radish instead of cucumber wrapped around it. It was refreshing but I think I prefer cucumber instead of radish. Overall, I'd go again and I'd recommend this place for sushi if you wanted something around this area.",

Never when we actually needed something like refills or forgotten rolls.  We felt rushed the whole time we were there.  There were other open tables and we were still eating so I'm not sure what the big deal was.  They have lunch specials that look pretty good.

The menu and choice of rolls is huge and there are some very unique offerings (never saw banana in a roll before) so just dig in because the fish is super fresh.  Rule two: order the sake because it is buy one get one.  If you don't sit at the bar you may miss the sign that announces this amazing deal.  Rule three: make sure not to forget the second sake.  Cheap hot sake is the best!  I will be back!",

    "text": "Two stars are for the sushi itself. It was great quality. The service was okay at first. Until we had a problem then we got dirty looks from the elder lady (owner maybe?). TYPICALLY when I order nigiri, from literally every sushi place I've ever been at, there's no wasabi on the rice. If they do, then they usually ASK if it's okay. (My aunt confirmed that they usually remind their guests about the wasabi but forgot to do so this time). I don't like wasabi, it ruins my sushi for me personally. So I bit into my nigiri & was disappointed to find wasabi in it, I checked all my other pieces and realized there was wasabi in all of it. So I  nicely told our waitress that I didn't like wasabi and didn't realize they would have it in their nigiri. She seemed to brush it off saying \"you should've said something first\" and walked away. I thought she would fix the problem for me, but after a while asked another lady if I was going to get a new plate since I couldn't eat wasabi. She went and told the sushi chefs right away (yay! Stoked, because I honestly really like their fish). I ended up getting my nigiri and quickly finished it and we got out of there as soon as possible. I didn't really want to tip the waitress, but my aunt did so anyways. Even tho we got an eye roll and multiple dirty looks. Whatever, I tipped and thanked the sushi chefs separately for the trouble, it's not their fault the waitress didn't do her job properly. Won't be returning though because of the rude service.",

Standard good rolls from a sushi restaurant but nothing spectacular.    What blew my socks off was the nigiri!  It was so fresh and delicious!  In vegas you have a lot of all you can eat sushi so the nigiri you get there is kind of ehhhh.... Either too much rice, or the fish is not fresh.... Or something about it is just off.  But this is not an all you can eat sushi place. The quality was very good. The coloring, the butteriness of the fish, the soft texture, everything was on point. Nigiri special changes daily as its up to the chefs choice.   I don't eat in Henderson often by im glad I came here.  They also have great beer on draft and happy hour as well!",

The ladies who work there are extremely grouchy and inattentive. I have given them plenty of chances to change my opinion in the last 6 months and it just hasn't gotten any better. I have to add that I am always friendly to servers and I try to be understanding, so for me to be dissatisfied with service is worth listening to.  Now the food...  The food is pretty good. The sushi is fresh (although could use more variety - a lot of cooked rolls) and the bento boxes/dinner plates are a good option for non-sushi eaters (particularly the kalbi short ribs).The servings are generous and most days good food is enough to get me to come back.",

The location is kind of odd as you don't really see it from Stephanie. The whole strip mall is not even facing the main road, it's awkwardly sideways. Just pull into the driveway past Marie Calendars and it will be on your left side.  So yes, the food here is awesome especially the Agadashi tofu. I've had this dish numerous times and I really do appreciate the presentation at Momo. The tofu is cut up in nice bite size pieces and sitting inside a bowl of broth. At other places the tofu is cut larger. When it's served larger so many awkward things can happen. 1) you cut it with your chopsticks and the crispy glaze breaks off. 2) you bite into it and you look like a Neanderthal with food dropping out of your mouth. 3) other embarrassing moments that should be left alone. The pieces at Momo were perfect!!  The rolls were so good. If you like tuna try the ultimate tuna roll. Spicy tuna with tuna on top, sitting in a spicy garlic type sauce/ oil. So good and the sauce keeps it moist!   So yes, whenever I get my nails done at Euphora I'm high tailing to Momo for lunch... For MOre sushi and Agadashi tofu.  Oh don't forget to check in on Yelp! We received free green tea ice cream! YAY!",

Ditch the low quality all you can eat sushi and come here if you want good and fresh quality fish.   We sat at the bar and James and Eric was our sushi chef. Fantastic and great chefs and I love when they give recommendations. Complimentary cucumber salad was brought out along with the usual ginger and wasabi.   What to order Hamachi sashimi with a jalapeno and a hint of Siracha. Not too spicy and the right amount of citrus.   Toro: By far my favorite nigiri - the fatty tuna belly. Most places don't have this and I didn't see it on the menu so just ask for it!  Uni shooter: Came in a martini glass. I'm a huge fan of uni.   Spicy halibut: with a hint of siracha and green onion.   Also here's a tip. Ask James for his \"Happy Orange\" dessert. *hint hint wink wink. It's actually quite clever.   5 stars for service and food.",

    "text": "I have eaten at Momo Sushi twice now, both for lunch. It would have been three times but the last time I tried to go for dinner it was packed. Momo definitely does the trick when I am in the mood for a little bit of sushi. Unfortunately, that is rarely the case, because when it comes to delicious raw fish, I like to stuff my face like a fatty. This is why I tend to go for sushi places that offer all you can eat...   On my first visit I wasn't super hungry and had plans for dinner later that evening, so I just stopped in for a snack. The sushi chefs were nice and the tuna nigiri had great texture and flavor. I did find service to be a little lacking, I had to ask the sushi chef to get a waitress to refill my water, and had a bit of a wait to get the check.   On my second visit I was very hungry. I ended up ordering edemame, a roll, as well as tuna and scallop nigiri. The sushi chef convinced me to go with the live scallop which was delicious.. but I wish I had known in advance it was going to cost me three times the price of the regular scallops.   Pros: Large and interesting rolls to choose from Friendly sushi chefs Above average fish quality  Cons: Can get pricey quick with no option for ACYE Waitress service is slow and not attentive enough On the small side  Since I live fairly close and am often in the area to run errands, there is a decent change I will go back to Momo Sushi at some point. Chances are I will drive a little farther and go someplace that offers more fishy bang for my buck though!",

When it comes to sushi, I don't do rolls or fried crap so a place needs to offer something special for me to be impressed. Here are some of the things I've loved...  (1) Service. Both times the service has been great and the chefs have been fairly chatty. I really got to know the guy the last time I went. (2) Baby Octopus Salad - This dish is just yummy. Healthy strips of baby octopus with sesame seeds and not sure what else but I scarf it down. (3) Uni shooter. I love an Uni Shooter so if a place offers it I'm in. (4) Live Shrimp - I first discovered this awesome treat in CA. They cut the live shrimp in front of you and serve you the tail meat. They then take the head, flash fry it, and you eat it. SOOOOOOO sweet and yummy! (5) They always have specials. I love a place that offers stuff off the menu. It shows they care and are trying to be inventive.  I'm not sure why there are bad reviews but they were all from a while back so maybe things have improved. Of all the places I've been in Las Vegas, outside of say Tao or Yellowtail type places, this is by far my favorite. It definitely makes a happy ending to an afternoon of shopping.",

We usually go to AYCE places, but the pricing here for not being AYCE was very reasonable and the food was of high quality. We had 1 lunch bento that came with miso soup, side salad, 2 entree items (chicken teriyaki and kalbi was what we ordered) and rice. We also ordered 3 rolls, and age dashi and the \"rolls rice ball\" and our bill came to $59. The \"rolls rice ball\" was amazing, was rice with fish and sauce mixed in, so a roll in a place. All the other rolls were very tasty as well. Definitely will go back to this place to try more items. I had to knock off some points though for the service. The waitress sighed and rolled her eyes when we said it would be 3 separate tabs, and she seemed to have a hard time keeping the orders straight. The other thing she did, which kind of shocked us all, was when asking if my friend wanted a refill, she grabbed the glass from her while she was mid drink to go refill it. Right out of her hand. My husband told me later that another waitress apologized for her and said that she was upset because 2 servers called out sick so she was called in. Sorry but that's her issue, one that shouldn't be taken out on the customer. Hopefully the service will be better next trip.",

There was maybe 5 or 6 older guys in there getting pretty drunk at the sushi bar and then entered a loud and drunk woman. They all started hitting on her, got shot down and then left. Then the woman announced her sexual preference (which does not bother me)  and announced very loudly to a couple at the bar that she was going to get the girl (the one on the date) before the guy would. I am very far from being a prude or shy but this became very awkward. I thought that the 3 guys behind the bar would stop it, but did not. Hopefully, this was an isolated thing because I'd like to go there and relax. Sorry, do not know the results of the showdown. LOL!",

Although this place does not have ayce it still should not be overlooked as a sushi option! If anything, the reason why their quality of fish is better than a lot of other place is because it does not have ayce. I would go here everytime for sushi but it's in Henderson and I live in Vegas.   The interior is well decorated and has a calming vibe, a cute place to bring a date for sure. Imo this is probably one of the best places in town. The prices are reasonable, the fish is quality, and try the jesty salmon roll! ^_^",

    "text": "\"It's okay to eat fish, because they don't have any feelings...\" - Kurt Cobain  I love fish...raw, seared, roasted, deep fried, smoked, whatever. But I have yet to find a \"go to\" spot here in the valley for good sashimi and sushi. When the wife and I lived down near the east side of Trop, we used to go to Sushi On Tropicana. It was a really good AYCE place, unfortunately it closed. Since moving to Henderson, we have been trying various locations that are just \"meh\". But, we keep coming back to Momo Sushi. They aren't an all-you-can-eat kind of place, but that's okay, their fish is pretty damned good...fresh, well prepared, delicious.  Located down on Stephanie, right next to Baby Stacks Cafe (excellent breakfast, BTW), right across from Burlington Coat Factory. Very unassuming and dark when you walk in, until you hear the familiar \"irasshaimase!\" greeting from the sushi chefs...good sized sushi bar and smallish dining room beside it. They do have booths, though. Waitresses are friendly and quick with the drink order, which is nice.  Before I met my wife, I would usually order my sushi nigiri and by the piece...she's introduced me to the world of specialty rolls, spicy mayo and sweet sauces...why not? (Still getting used to the cream cheese thing, though). Momo has an array of specialty rolls, like most places, difference being, these are pretty good sized rolls (maybe making up for the fact they don't do AYCE sushi?). Most are priced in the mid-range of between $8.95 and $14.95.  The wife's favorite is, of course, the Screaming Orgasm (insert girlish giggle here...), seared tuna piled around a mountain of shredded daikon radish surrounded by a moat of spicy garlic ponzu sauce and mayo. Get the large, it's good. My favorites are the Spider Roll, I love soft-shell crab...and the Something Wrong 69 roll, more soft-shell crab with shrimp tempura, topped with an assortment of fish (a little bit of everything, iz oishii). If I still have room at the end of the meal, I'll sometimes skip the mochi ice cream and get the Zaru Soba (buckwheat noodles, served cold). I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it on the menu, it's the perfect way to finish a meal.  So, I don't know if I've found my \"go-to\" spot yet...but, Momo Sushi is close. If your looking for a good izakaya restaurant/sushi joint, check it out...I just noticed they have Hamachi Kama on the menu, will have get that next time...I love a nice fatty piece of broiled or grilled fish collar.",

Then as my family and I were eating our sushi, I found a hair in my food.  I'm sure it happens even if being cautious but both instances were enough for me to write this review.

Other piece, I don't remember.  Miso good. Only one server, ask if everything okay, but I rather they just come fill our drinks up.  We had to ask. One sushi chef behind bar. Return.  Never.

For a Sushi lover, I have eaten and visited a lot of Sushi establishments in different states and here at home. The food is good but the service lacked. When we arrived the reception from the staff was very strained. It's as if sating \"hello\" or \"welcome\" was too much work for them.  We were sat by the server and each of us were given menus. Since it was our first time, we were reading, very carefully the menu so we can make good decisions in what to eat. Server came to take our orders more than once. I told her we needed more time but she kept coming back really fast without allowing us to have time to decide. We felt rushed.  After we ordered and our food delivered, you'd think that they will come back to check up on us and see if we needed our glasses re-filled with our beverages. No one did that. I was parched and I had to get someone's attention to get my glass of water refilled. Could it be that I only had water and not Soda or an alcoholic beverage? Whatever the reason, I feel that I shouldn't have to flag someone that many times to get my glass of beverage refilled.  The food was good but I've eaten better in other establishments that are cheaper who also gave us better service than they.  The place is simply not friendly and welcoming.  To return to this place will not happen again. Not a  recommendation to anyone.  I give them two thumbs down.",

We tried the irish roll, palm tree roll, and volcano roll. The Irish roll is somewhat odd tasting because of the liquidy sauce on it. Just an odd taste so neither of us liked it. My wife liked the palm tree roll and I really liked the volcano roll. I would recommend it to friends and will go back and try a few more rolls because overall it was good, and theres a huge selection of rolls.",

He had the Lunch Special ($8.95) with the Miso soup, other sides, chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. He thought both chickens were very good, the teriyaki chicken was not fatty and was tender & moist. He loved the Miso soup, thought it was one of the best he had tried at local places. He also had ebi, magura and hamachi nigiri, and thought all tasted fresh. I had the usual embarrassingly named rolls and they were quite tasty. When the older sushi chef had to tell the other chef to make the S on the B roll, they both giggled and shook their heads.... but I got past it and it was good eating! I had been so focused on the menu, that I didn't look up and see the daily special board right in front of me until after ordering... I will be back to try some of those. We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed watching the chefs create the plates, er.. boats. One boat was made with a fish he filleted as we watched. The final product had what was left of the fish as adornment. Looks much better than it sounds.",

For Saturday at lunch we found the restaurant to be pretty empty and we were quickly seated at a booth. I started with Edamame that wasn't good, possibly even bad. It didn't seem fresh. My other starter was a Green Salad and I absolutely loved the ginger dressing on top. My husband and I shared three rolls. We ordered the Mexico City, Hawaiian, and Shrimp Tempura. My favorite was the Hawaiian, but overall we liked all three.   The service was mediocre. The waitress was sweet, but she seemed very frazzled even though the restaurant wasn't busy. We had to order my husband's Sprite twice and it seemed like she thought it was a new order instead of something she forgot about. After all the food arrived sans salad I had to ask for my salad a second time. She was about to take our order and ran away mid-sentence before returning to take our order. Other tables were walking back to the kitchen to ask for forgotten items too. I kind of felt bad for her because she seemed totally out of it. Maybe it was just an off day.   Overall, the rolls were decent, but the service left a little to be desired.",

The quality of fish for the sushi is decent but generally not a good cut of fish. The hamachi was a bit stiff and stringy. We did get the Sushi boat to share and that thing was huge for $50. Our bill was pretty high and we didn't feel like we got a lot of food.   The rolls were ok. Service was ok, pretty mediocre.   I think I'd get the same quality if not better quality at an AYCE place down the street. Most likely not coming back.",

It's not my usual sushi place an it's a little far from where I live. But hey my son lives this place so what the heck. WOW I have to say I couldn't get enough. The rolls were amazing. I ate way to much but loved every bite. Everything was very fresh an spot on. Everything we had from the spicy edamame to the rolls an even the teriyaki chicken were sooo yummy. The prices were reasonable an the service was perfect. We sat at the sushi bar which I like as you just order what you want. I know Its a drive but I will definitely go back. I'm so glad my son suggested to go there.",

The sauce had a lot of vinegar so if that's not a flavor you like stay away there are TONs of rolls to choose from. This was my first time here and the only reason for 4 stars is how loose the roll was rolled making it hard to eat",

Some noticeable traits: the lighting does not work well with the menus, as the glare makes the reading uncomfortable, and my ice cream was partially melted. Another interesting characteristic is that the fish on the nigiri seems lengthy compared to the rice. It's not hugging the mound of rice, like most, but instead trails off both ends. It doesn't mean anything, I suppose, it just looks different.",

Now I don't know if my palate has changed (highly doubt that) but the spicy tuna was so damn good!  It had the perfect blend of flavors with the right amount of kick, if you know what I mean!  And if you want to go for a big bang, you can get it extra spicy! =D    I ordered the salmon skin salad, Orion Roll and the Jesty Roll.  Salmon Skin Salad:  Mmmm...the skin was crispy!  And the dressing was good!  None of that soggy salmon skin crap you get at some places.  Highly recommended! =)    Orion Roll:  Momo's edition of spicy tuna roll topped with albacore tuna and drizzled with a garlic sauce.  Very delicious!  Rice was perfect, not too mushy, and not too undercooked!  Yum!!    Jesty Roll:  Salmon rolled in masago, rolled up in rice, topped with more salmon and a thinly sliced lemon!  Super good for that refreshing taste you sometimes crave! =)    The only down side to this place is it is a bit pricey.  I was bit upset at first, but once that spicy tuna hit my taste buds, they were dancing with joy and the price didn't matter anymore! haha.    Check it out guys! =)",

The only redeeming quality Well, I first got the Salmon. It was dry and slightly Chewy. Then came the Albacore. Or should I say, partially seared, Albacore. For some reasonm they decide to sear it, without making it clear, on the menu. Otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it. The thing I love about Albacore, is the melt in your mouth texture. This was Crap! I couldn't eat my order, This presentation of Sushi destroyed my desire for Sushi, for a couple months. I will not return here, as there are better places, not far. They should be ashamed.",

I put my order in and had my co-worker pick it up, apparently on their menu, you're supposed to get gyoza, tamago and inari sushi. But I didn't get that. Oh well.

    "text": "I really like this little place. It is hidden away in the retail hell of Stephanie Street down by the Sunset Station, but it is worth finding. Hit them on either Friday or over the weekend. I have been told that they get their fresh fish order on Friday and they tend to run out of some items as the week goes on. The Sushi is good and presented well with style and subdued beauty. They do not hide the flavor of their sushi with too much sauce, but instead rely on the quality of their fish and their work. They are quick and efficient. They have always been quick and efficient every visit I have made. My drink is never empty and a dirty dish does not sit on the table long.  They don't have an all you can eat so going on a sushi binge can get pricey. However, they do have a specials board behind the bar. I strongly urge you to take advantage of the specials as I have never been disappointed by them. They usually have a halibut sushi on the specials list that I simply love. Be brave when ordering because they have some pretty unique creations. Food courage is the most rewarding courage of all.   I sadly can't give them five stars because their was a sushi place I went to all the time in North Carolina which IMO is the best sushi I have ever had. It has simply ruined me and all other sushi I eat I compare to that place. Sadly, nothing has ever lived up to their quality, but Momo comes pretty darn close. I wouldn't say it's worth a trip across town, but if you are in the southeast of Vegas for any reason over the weekend, this is must. And tell Momo I said hi... (I don't know who the hell Momo is or even if there is a Momo, but a dare you to walk in and say \"Doc says to tell Momo hi.\")",

I will keep coming back to this place. If you want a fancy sushi bar? This ain't for you. Happy fishy!",

Only problem I found is the tempura is placed in the soup prior to arriving at the table, and therefore it was soggy and was falling apart.  Screaming Orgasm has a small and a large option, and comes on a bed of shredded radish (daikon).  Heavy sauce but it gives it a good flavor.  Overall the service is quick, but there were two times that the communication fell apart and two items did not make it to our table without a reminder that we were waiting for items.  If you get your items and are missing anything, it is best to just assume they may have forgotten or communication broke down, so give a friendly reminder.  They did not react rudely or condescending; very apologetic and moved with haste to get it to us.  Pictured:  Jhonny's Special Roll (ordered by someone in our party.  And yes, the spelling is what was on the menu).",

My daughter and I split the shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer. It was light, crispy and delicious. The vegetable seemed fresh and the shrimp were large and tasty My daughter got the chicken katsu. I had a bite and it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. How could I forget the edamame! Get it with the spicy garlic. YUM. I could almost make a meal of them. My daughter and her boyfriend go here all the time. No wonder!",

I liked most of what I had but don't personally care for their Cajun tuna at all, the seasoning is overwhelming and the texture was hard as if it was recently defrosted.   Other reviews complain about the service, but I sat at the sushi bar and the chef was polite. When it came time to get my bill, the server was nowhere to be found, but I was one of only two customers. Their menu of rolls is considerable, but I'd probably stick to the same order if I returned.",

And don't get me started on the miso soup, I've been to plenty of places and I always say no to miso soup because I never thought it was good enough, but this place completely changed my mind! I will be going here for most celebrations now. It'd be awesome if this place had an ALL YOU CAN EAT option though, that's the only complain I have.

We ordered water and they only brought 2 of the three we asked for (nothing resembling a kid's cup) we eventually got another water when we ordered our food but it set the tone for the rest of the evening.   Food arrived relatively quickly and was average sushi, nothing remarkable. We ordered udon with chicken and the waitress though the best place to put it was directly in front of our 6 month-old. Before we could even react he grabbed the plate the bowl was on and pulled it, causing extremely hot udon to splash out onto his hand. Just about every other customer saw or heard what happened and audibly reacted, some even asked what they could do, not one single employee even bothered to see if there was anything they could do. As parents we understand and accept it is ultimately our responsibility to keep our kids from harm but who in their right mind would put steaming hot soup in front of a 6 month old...?  Our last roll was brought out about 5 minutes later and that was the last time we saw our waitress until we stopped her and asked for a container for the remaining udon. That was also the only time our water was refilled, after our food was gone and we were waiting for them to bring our bill.   When we arrived it was not very busy, by the time we received our food the dinning area had filled up  but there was never more than 1 group waiting to be seated. Had they been swamped with customers I would better understand the lack of service but there was no obvious explanation.   Needless to say we won't be returning; average food at best and even if the food had been exceptional the quality of service would keep us away.",

Usually I'll have a bunch of rice and ingredients piling up in my sauce bowl, and have to dump it out, but after all the rolls, all that was left was soy sauce with maybe 1-2 pieces of rice.  He even made us a personal chefs creation, which was different than the usual that we eat anywhere else but it was delicious! Great Sushi Chef!! (Pic added!) We also had dessert. At other sushi places, you might get one little scoop of ice-cream, but not at Momo Sushi, there was at LEAST 3 scoops in that bowl lol and I love ice cream, there's always room for dessert! Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be going back, thankfully we live just around the corner! I definitely recommended it to anyone that wants to find a new place to go that is better than your usual! Thanks again Eric and Momo Sushi!",

We had the Ugly Roll, Screaming Honey, Palm-tree Roll, Sex on the Beach, Something Wrong 69, and When Shrimp Meets Crab. I would give the food 5 stars. The service, I would give 3.5 stars. The atmosphere, 3.5 stars as well. The waitresses are a little pushy and seem to rush you out as soon as you're done eating. The establishment itself is a little too dim for my liking and it's a little sloppy looking in my opinion - it looks more like someone's house rather than a restaurant. But overall, I would recommend this place for sushi if you're in the Green Valley area! We've been back multiple times ever since our first visit!",

We have also seen a lot of waitresses over the years. The quality of the food and level of service have never dipped. Whenever I get a chance to turn someone on to sushi I bring them here with the disclaimer they will never find a spot better than mine.

I stood at the door for a while while everyone kind of looked at me, then a sushi chef yelled \"CUSTOMER!!!\" and everyone came up to me at once.

    "text": "First off, I'd like to say that I enjoyed the decor here. There are places to sit in a booth or on chairs and have a bar area that is easy to access.  Usually bars are placed in the back and you have to walk through the tables, but Momos had their bar in the front corner.  Easy access if it is a busy day.   When I arrived it was slow so service was great. However, when it became busy the service was becoming slow due to the restaurant only having two servers. I felt as if I had to flag one of the two servers down to place another order.   My boyfriend had the opportunity to visit Japan and while we were eating he had nothing but the best compliments about the sushi. He stated, \"this reminds me of when I was back in Japan\".   I enjoyed my meal as well, I had a lunch special and each space had a good portion of food. It wasn't too shy or too overwhelming. I was very pleased.  I drank the green tea and I have to say although it was a little light in taste, it was fairly good.",

It is good but I wish the pork was fried crisper.  The sushi is very good and there is a large variety of rolls.  They also have a selection of bento lunch and dinner combos.  It is a very hands off service staff which is refreshing.  We enjoy hitting the book store across the street before grabbing a roll or two.",

Most waitresses were friendly and nice BUTTTTT.... one waitress left the whole experience crappy!  She has theee worst mannerisms. She rushed our food out screaming out rolls really fast and repeating herself constantly with her thick accent and shaking the dish like someone grab it!!! Rolled her eyes when we didn't understand her deep heavy accent also. Then they kept bring us out the wrong dish. Like 4 times! Wth?! This lady has short black bob cut hair.  The other ladies were very sweet though.   They did lose another point because when I asked for my roll with no rice they immediately said no and I was like WTH?! I go to loads of sushi spots. And I will judge your establishment if u can't accommodate. It's not hard?! Why do some places know how to and others say no?! It's laziness and or no experience on the sushi chef. After much debate... I had to tell them how to do it...add soy paper and crab meat if needed. When I got it they still sealed roll with rice and the edge. Like what if I had a gluten allergy? Smh.  This place does have really great selection of rolls and really fresh fish. So it sucks that everything else ruined it for them.",

I was horrified and called Momo's to tell them what had happened. They recommended that I come back to the restaurant to show them the video and to get a refund. I went back a couple hours later and the sushi chef and waitress apologized and told me it had nothing to do with the fish as it would have been more of a parasitic worm, as this was more of a plant bug. They informed me it was from the sprouts on top of the screaming orgasm that they had received from a vendor and that in the future they will be more cautious as to cleaning the sprouts more thoroughly and they had already contacted the vendor.  They gave me a full refund and a gift card for the future. I have never had any problems with them previously and was very caught off guard when it happened.",

The most important thing to mention is that almost all of their rolls feature crab mix, which I don't eat.  If you're like me, this place is not for you. If they are not busy, they will customize, but I get embarrassed when I have to do that.  We ordered two rolls and they were just okay; their sushi rice is kinda bland compared to others.  If you want awesome sushi, go to Tokyo Boys down the street.",

Pretty much you come in, place your order, they give you your food, you eat, pay for your bill and leave. Sure, the spicy tuna rolls and this other sushi roll my friend and I ordered were delicious but damn...the price was pretty expensive. $10-12 for spicy tuna rolls!? Come on now.... Then again...look at where Momo Sushi is located at: Henderson. There are plenty of other sushi places especially on the West side/Chinatown that have better prices.  The only reason why we came here for lunch was because we were in the area and we were craving for sushi.",

We ordered several rolls to share, and they came out as made, one at a time - and quick! Loved the Irish roll (but then, I would, huh?) The Orion roll was delightfully spicy and flavorful. The Rock-n-Roll did, in fact, rock. Hot tea got immediate refills without asking. Prices were mid-range. Sake prices were too high to bother with, though.  Clean, small, close to home, and yummy (and since Yummy shut down, we've been looking for another...)  My only complaint is that the music seriously bites. Bad rap-fusion-80's asian-not-sure-what-but-it's-bad. Just bad.  Music bad. Food good.",

I liked the salmon teriyaki, and the chicken katsu was pretty crispy. Ginger salad was good too.    My six year old said that the food was really yummy. The children's box is the same price as the lunch special. I would pick the lunch special since you get more selection.    My only complaint was that the hot water in the woman's bathroom is scalding.  My 6 year old burned 2 of her fingers washing her hands. So  if you are bringing children to the bathroom, you need to regulate the water. We did tell the waitress and hopefully they will turn the water down.  Overall, we will eat here again. I agree with Sunny D's review- sushi is right up there and the prices are reasonable only at lunch time.  We ordered take out for dinner, and the dinner menu prices were overpriced. I would eat here only for lunch. When we ordered take out, they forgot one menu item and we had to drive back and get the rest of the order.",

But as far as sushi goes, it's my favorite place in this area. I've been a regular here for since 2005.  I always order the Momo Yellowtail Sashimi special. At $12-14 it's not that great of a deal but they serve it with more fish than other places; the yellowtail is cut perfectly and covered with the right amount of citrus sauce, jalapeno and cilantro. Sen of Japan adds a crispy topping to this dish that I like, but they charge a little more too.  All other rolls are great. The Rebecca used to be a favorite. I also like the Irish Roll.

I am a HUGE fan of sushi and this place seems fresh to me, not to mention they have a huge list of Specialty rolls that i suggest trying.  Or you can sit at the sushi bar and tell them exactly what you want and they'll whip it up.  We've been back 3 times and it's been good every time, except one time they forgot a roll (a group of 6, so maybe smaller groups are better).  Very good, I always get a Tall Sapporo or Kirin Ichiban with my meal too, great beer.    Enjoy",

They do not do All you can eat here but I think thats a good thing. Their quality is much higher as a result. The place itself is sort of hidden off the west side of Stephanie in a small strip mall. Definitely check this place out if you are a Sushi coniseur.",

We walked in and the waitress asked how many and seated us at the bar, did not really smile at us or act friendly. I got a vibe that they were tired and wanted to go home. The next two people that walked in must of been regulars because the sushi chefs and waitresses immediately acknowledged them and said hello... Um, ok.  Anyhoo on the food...   I cannot complain about it,  it was really yummy. I got the Ninja box (teriyaki beef, shrimp/veggie tempura, spicy tuna roll (4 pieces) and some kind of dumpling?  Also came with salad and miso soup. My friend ordered the Jen 2 roll and the soft shell crab appetizer, she said both of them were good.   Pro's - Food was great, restaurant is small and cozy, large sushi bar space to eat (hate rubbing elbows with my neighbor)  Con's - Bitchy waitstaff, never asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks even though they charged us almost $3 for a coke, the prices on the sushi rolls here are pretty expensive and they don't have AYCE, booo.",

The quality of sushi is great, the guys here won't serve anything they don't like. And have always been up front on what's fresh etc.     If you like Sashimi and you like it a bit spicy, then definitely try the Momo Hamachi appetizer. Its def one of my favorites. Perfectly sliced pieces of Hamachi, with a leaf of cilantro, and a thin slice of a jalapeno with a drop of sriracha...and Yuzu sauce  (kind of a citrucy flavor) And after enjoying this, I usually get the Kiss of fire roll, and ask if they Have Sake Kama ( salmon collar ).      Over all the atmosphere and staff are good. Its not overly loud, and the inside styling is like most pacific rim Japanese restaurants.     There are other great rolls and cooked fare as well. Just have a look at their menu.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.momosushilasvegas.com%2Fhome.html&s=8a9ec546b8c2105bb5874c4d6a0bd12cb34bcbdfdb83e41491f32c5ac14fe17f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">momosushilasvegas.com/ho...</a>",

We've probably tried everything on the menu at least once, but our absolute favorite top two things to order are the Henry Roll and the Ugly Roll.  Sometimes, when we don't know what we want, B takes over and just creates something for us on the fly.. he's truly a very talented and detail oriented chef!!!

It was edible yes, but not that fresh or appetizing. I'm a regular at Sushi Fever on W. Sahara which blows this place out of the water. If anybody that comes here thinks this is good sushi go visit Sushi Fever and you'll see the huge difference. And btw I completely unbiased to both places the food here just wasn't good.  I've had enough sushi over the years to know great sushi and mediocre sushi. The tuna did not look bright and pink it was more brown and pink. The service was meh as well not bad, but not great.   Also as a side note, BABYSTACKS and Genghis Grill which are right next store are both great!",

We waited 20 min just for the server to get our drink order and another 20 for her to come back and get our food order. They kept messing up our order and we couldn't wait to get out of there honestly. Only reason they have 2 stars is because some of their items on the menu are good but it's such a hit or miss. They need to learn how to cut fish pieces correctly. I got a roll with tuna on top and it was literally a fat CHUNK of tuna which was due to cutting too much not appetizing at all. They also did the same to my albacore sushi which is why I just ordered fried sushi or other appetizers.",

The atmosphere is chill & our waitress was very helpful. I tried two of their special rolls, the kiss of fire and Johnny Roll. The kiss of fire roll was good, but it lacked heat in which I was really looking forward too. I've had the kiss of fire roll from Sakana sushi, so I was expecting some good heat from Momo's version , after all it is called the \"Kiss of Fire\" right???? The Johnny Roll was good as well. Other than the above, overall it was a good restaurant and the rolls are a good sized portion, so I can't really complain.",

It seems that it was perfectly suited to be a sushi restaurant. It just works right!  The service - A bit homey and homestyle, so you get both caring people who can be a bit slow at times.  Hey, you know what, that is okay with me because it feels like family.  The Sushi - This is where the place excels.  Had several orders of  Uni, Amai Ebi, Maguro, Tai, Hamachi, It was all so very good.  Large nice pieces of fish and very flavorful. You should be aware that they do use the wasabi on the sushi between the rice and the fish, so if you don't want it, you should tell them.  I enjoy it but my son prefers to not have wasabi.  I was not happy that they did not have the Toro that was on the menu and the Kai as they were out.  I also ordered Mirugai and they were out of this too.  Boo hoo.  I would have marked them a 4 star for the food but what they did have was awesome.  I have to give kudos to the Amai Ebi.  The fried shrimp head was so plump and so delicious.  I wonder if they somehow stuffed the them heads with something way deliciouso???  We also had some seriously large rolls like Tiger, Dragon, and a few others.  All were good and tasty, just that I am not a huge Roll person.  The price - For about 4-5 rolls and all the nigiri sushi, we spent about 100.00 so while for the three of us it was more expensive than an AYCE place, the quality was amazing.  GK says, check it out...",

I actually had him go back a few weeks later to get me some Miso soup because I forgot to try and I loved that too!! I will definitely be back.",

The portions are good and fish is very fresh as mentioned before. I liked the roll that had salmon and lemon on top - forgot the name. The baked dynamite I would not order again. Philly roll was good, but that is a basic roll & hard to mess up. Would definitely order from here again, yet the budget won't allow for that all too often because the rolls are a bit pricey here. Standard philly roll was $7 and specialty rolls will run you $13 or more.",

My friends also cleared their plates and everything I tasted of theirs was awesome.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the service was kind of hit or miss. Our food arrived in strange orders - like our appetizer was almost the last thing to arrive and our rolls came out so that some of us were eating and other weren't.  Overall, a great place and I can overlook the service because the food was so tasty.",

I'm eternally impressed with the quality of the fish and the friendliness of the staff.  We've gotten to know Jhonny (yes, it's spelled that way) the owner and even see him around Henderson, giving it an even more local feel.  The sushi chefs are fairly consistent and are quick to suggest things not on the menu.  We are sushi purists (always prefer sashimi to anything resembling catfood and/or covered in \"yumyum\" sauce!) and usually go in and request \"the best fish you have.\"  This can be dangerous for the wallet at times -- but always results in luscious, large chunks of fish.   I've grown especially fond of the AJI (spanish mackerel sashimi).  The body of the fish (skeleton, tail & head) are used as a serving plate for the sashimi.  After you are finished, the take the fish body, fry it up, and reserve it to you as a crispy snack.",

They would definitely lose money on it, haha. I love their sashimi, the sushi chefs here are amazing! I leave always satisfied and happy. Great service, great quality, and super cozy. I have been coming here for over a decade and I will always return.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised to see that the place was crowded and the sushi bar almost full! I saw the beautiful tuna the chef was apportioning and wrapping well to keep nice and chilled. My friend and I both had the lunch boxes and I shamefully ate everything on my plate!! It was a bit pricey but if it insures fresh fish and well cooked food- then it follows they buy the best top of the line fish. I read from a chef's diary, that discount sushi bars buy the cheapest quality fish - so I am going by that nugget of inside info. I am giving this 4 stars because service can be improved. The waitress might be overworked, underpaid and undertipped. I would go back there again - for sure!!!",
