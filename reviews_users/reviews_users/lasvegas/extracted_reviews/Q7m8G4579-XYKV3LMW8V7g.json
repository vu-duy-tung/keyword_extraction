The noise level was just right. Music wasn't overbearing and the conversations throughout were at a low level. The seating arrangements have options. You can sit at the bar, separate tables, or picnic style table. We had the tuna hand roll, ceviche, and octopus and cucumber salad. The best hands down was the octopus and cucumber salad. It had the perfect blend of sweet, cool, sea, and spicy. The tuna hand rolls were simple but great. No frills, just tuna and rice; the way it should be. The ceviche was delicious but I wasn't too big a fan of the rice noodles inside. But, it was definitely 5 star ready. I will be returning next time I'm in Vegas.",

They have a relaxed, nice vibe with friendly, efficient service and a great spread of rolls and solid quality fish.    A great spot to sink some cold beer/sake and fill your belly with friends after a massive few days on the town ;)",

Yeap its an American style sushi spot ran by maybe Koreans with all kinds of fried sushi rolls...which is exactly what this hungover girl was craving anyway.  Albacore with crispy onions ..Yum Salmon nigiri...Yum Shrimp tempura roll...Yum some kind of bulgogi roll..Yum and some other specialty roll, can't remember...  Everything I had was delcious and fresh....service was fast and friendly and I felt happy here...the hangover required that I be around only a few people and the HardRock was totally over crowded...

I really don't like to get sushi delievered because, it just is never that good, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Plus, I just wasn't ready to die. I used the roadrunner food delievery app and it let me customize my order exactly how I like it (I'm one of those annoying cant order directly off the menu people) . Food was delievered to me exactly how I wanted it and I got to eat with my favorite dining companion, my cat- Ape. I also did not have to wear pants like a civilized person. I took my first nom, and it was delicious!! Cold, fresh and yummy. I also love their \"beef tarta\" . This place is great. If you can crawl outside with pants on, they are open late and super friendly inside.",

Not only did they completely screw up my takeout order, but they served us bad fish. I called to speak with management and was told I would be called back the next day. I called back the next day after my call wasn't returned, and again, no manager. Same thing for day 3 and 4. Only after threatening to contact the health department was I coincidentally given to the manager. Who offered no apology, and instead offered a $20 credit for next time. Why on earth would I return to a restaurant that made me sick?? Anyway, I was eventually offered a $11.99 cash refund. Which is a complete joke, not to mention insult. I will be contacting the health department this morning, as this is not acceptable. This place should be shut down for criminal negligence.",

(Plenty of free parking if you're driving, btw!) I was impressed with the hip, modern and clean design. Definitely wasn't expecting this place to be that stylish.   The hostess was friendly and seated me right away. She also was my server and was very on top of things. The prices are about average, but not as ridiculous as the casino sushi places. The best deal I found was the chicken katsu bowl, which was around $10. It was the most delicious katsu I had in a long time. It was moist and the serving size was perfect. I hate when katsu is dried out and tough, but this definitely wasn't the case here. I had a good miso soup and a roll too. I can't remember the name of the roll, but it delicious. The fish was fresh and the sauce complimented it perfectly. My server came by several times to check on me and refill my beverages. All in all, I had a great experience and I will definitely be back. Saw lots of good dishes going by that I would like to try next time! But, trust me, try the chicken katsu!",

She told us what she likes and dislikes which is a big deal to me. I'm a HUGE fan of Eel and that have an appetizer with 8 pieces of will served on a sizzling skillet with onions and peppers it was delicious! I had the King Crab Miso Soup it was beyond amazing!

From the moment I walked in I was greeted by nothing but positive and upbeat vibes, they were even playing popular music that I had taken a liking to. I decided to relax at an elegant, and I must say slightly romantic, table with the good friends I had been accompanied by. The service was prompt and very polite and I coaxed myself into an appetizer while the somewhat indecisive female friend of mine took her time perusing the menu to find something befitting of her selective tastes. Much to my delight the appetizer was phenomenal and set the tone for every bit of food thereafter, as it was all exquisite. We were very satisfied after a few rolls and sat with a tantalizing feeling befitting a king after such a wonderful meal. We even were a bit naughty and went for dessert despite having to take some of the sushi home, but alas, when in Vegas one must live a little. To conclude, I give Kaisen sushi a well-deserved 5 star rating and would highly recommend it to any malnourished travelers looking to tickle their fancies with a smorgasbord of incredible tastes!!",

I get that there's only three of you, but why bother sitting down somebody you're not even gonna take care of? Obviously the visit was already at a bad start and I was not happy, after getting the waitress' attention, the one that sat us down -- she asks \"has anyone helped us?\" LIKE SERIOUSLY?!!! After 15 mins you FINALLY noticed?! Food was a hit and miss.  But honestly it was really hard to enjoy the whole experience with the terrible service provided. A revisit is unfortunately not in the near future..",

I don't agree with the numerous reviews that it was the best sushi, but of the four rolls we got the T.T roll was the best. The other 3 rolls we got were the Jay roll, Katana roll and the Salmon killer. They were typical rolls drowned in a lot of sauce!  ******This is an edit to my review. The advertisement said check in and get a free item. When I inquired about it I was told \"you have to write a review\". I wrote a review and was ignored for 21 minutes until we had to flag our server down. It wasn't that busy and she passed by our table over 10 times to help the customers next to us. I give this place 2 stars. Service is terrible and sushi was mediocre.",

    "text": "Very quiet when we went in for an early dinner. Right across from the Hard Rock you can walk across the street. They were nice-made us some rolls from a very busy menu of rolls. We ordered a cold sake thought it was coming in a larger bottle, our bad but for the price we asked to just get the LARGE bottle. The next size up. It made sense. So they came and nicely poured a half empty bottle of that sake. Not sure if they poured it out or someone else had a half bottle....Regardless they were happy to do this. When we didn't finish it of course, it was huge, we thought we'd cap it and take it with us to our Hotel. WE do this at every restaurant in SD all the time. Cork your wine and take it with you if you don;t finish it. In Vegas where everyone walks around the streets with alcohol, no big deal right. Well our waiter was happy to go back and put in a to go container but the owner stopped him. Said it was illegal that we couldn't take it with us but he was happy to put our name on it. Well, what when we came back in a few weeks or months.?? He wasn't nice at all, or apologetic. Rude and didn't care really. Totally ruined the feel of this place for me. The sushi wasn't amazing anyways and in Vegas there is an abundance of killer places to eat.",

I wasn't quite sure how it worked and was skeptical so I kept asking the waitress, Nour questions. It was packed there on a Friday night, we waited 30 minutes to be sat so needless to say this waitress was extremely busy. The food was good, we had an assortment of rolls that ranged from good to amazing, we also had a bunch of appetizers (everything on the on the menu is included in all you can eat btw). The star of my visit was the service, when you go to a place that's so busy you automatically turn down your expectations of the service. Not here, I was surprised to see her keep up with the pace and keep a smile, composure and efficiency. We asked like...a hundred questions and Nour answered them all with a smile, didn't seem rushed in her responses. She even recommended items based off the questions we were asking. All the others seemed to be the same way so I'd assume that the people who work there like their job...and it shows to the customers. Good job guys, keep up the good work.",

I love the ambiance and customer service. They are attentive and helpful. Nicely decorated with elegant simplicity.   We ordered the avocado train, spicy rainbow roll, and the baked scallop. All in all, we were speechless the whole time we were eating because it was that good! The avocado train had a delightful surprise with an avocado ball at the end of the roll. What is in it, you ask? You gotta order it and find out! The spicy rainbow roll was a good balance of spicy and fresh fish. Lastly I love the sauce on the baked scallop roll. The mushroom and scallops were super good!   Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family!",

I came in with a couple of friends and it's 12am on a Friday night, I would get if it was super packed, but it wasn't. So we had to share a menu, 3 waiters were \"waiting our table\" the reason for the quotations because they were doing anything but tending to us. Not like we asked for much. Just some more water since we had to wait so long to order, get our food just everything in general. Then we look over and see one of our \"waiters\" taking sake shots with his friends instead of taking care of other customers. Also don't asked for anything else after they bring you your food unless you wanna get hit with a nasty attitude like it's an inconvenience. Terrible service, whoever did the hiring needs to be let go cause they aren't a good judge of character.",

In the fall of 2014 I had been in Las Vegas briefly and had quickly grabbed takeout from here. I remember thinking the ambience was fun. Returning to Las Vegas in December of 2015 I used Yelp to track down this sushi restaurant that I remembered enjoying but couldn't remember the name of.  Since I was traveling for work I was often on my own for dinner. Walking into Kaizen I was instantly welcomed and the staff was more than happy to give me a table to myself since the restaurant was not too busy.   Over the three separate visits I made to Kaizen I got to sample a variety of rolls, all of which I enjoyed: -Philadelphia Roll-specially requested for this to be made with salmon and cream cheese inside and salmon on top -Sexy Roll-spicy tuna inside topped with fresh tuna, smelt eggs, and tangy sauce -Crunch Roll-deep fried shrimp, Yamagobo, cucumber inside topped with tempura crunch and eel sauce -Red Rock Roll-deep fried shrimp and cucumber inside topped with spicy tuna, seared tuna, and spicy mayo -Hot Night Roll-deep fried shrimp and cucumber inside topped with spicy tuna and eel sauce -Orange Blossom Roll-deep fried chopped shrimp and crab inside topped with salmon and tangy sauce  Everything I had was delicious and the service is polite and quick. Definitely great to stop in for dinner when traveling for business. On weekends the restaurant can get significantly busier so expect to sit at the bar if you're dining solo.",

Then i saw the nicely formed, eye appealing varieties of sushi on the white plates.  As i looked through the menu, it was so hard to choose which roll to get. I wanted to try them all but my bank account wouldn't let me. The waiter was patient and made some recommendations. As soon as it came to the table we devoured them up, thus no picture was taken.  The rice on each roll was fluffy and not overly sticky, the fish was cold, firm and tasty, the rolls that had tempura waa freshly made, evident from the crunch and warmth of the tempura as you bit into the whole roll. My favorite had to be the roll with fresh tuna and roe. The roe just pops as you bite into it. In all we ordered 5 different rolls and spent over 80 with tip. I don't usually spend this amount for so little food and if I do it has to be spectacular. This place hit it out of the ballfield.",

    "text": "The Japanese word \"Kaizen\" brings back memories of my B-school days, when studying operations management in the car industry.  Kaizen means \"continuous improvement\" - why would any restaurant want to name themselves this?  Maybe Kaizen Sushi is aware of its shortcomings and wants to strive to be the best.  HMMM...  Food & Drinks I came here with a couple of girlfriends for lunch and we immediately ordered lychee sake.  Points for having this on the menu!  It might be the Boone's Farm of sake, but can't deny that it was goooood!  We didn't want anything too heavy to eat because we had early dinner reservations, so one of my girlfriends had sashimi, the other had a bento box of short ribs, while I had the ahi salad.  As you can see, the unifying thread was NO RICE  (we were going clubbing that night - we didn't want to look TOO bloated!)  Amazingly, these dishes were satisfying - the portions were pretty generous.  Because we ordered from the lunch menu, everything was reasonably priced.   No complaints here!  Atmosphere Kaizen is located in a little strip mall, so we weren't expecting the place to look anything less than your run-of-the mill sushi joint.  However, Kaizen had some pizzazz - the walls were colorful and rock music was playing.  We felt like we had walked into a bar.  For what it is, Kaizen scores points for atmosphere too - no complaints here either!  Service This is where Kaizen should practice some Kaizen.  Orders came to the table slowly and randomly.  The bento box came first, which had my friend & I drooling.  My order came last, and by this time I was ravenous!  They should have served our food all at once!   So I'd give Kaizen 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll round up because their name suggests they are striving for perfection.  As far as the service goes, I should hope so!",

Service was also excellent, the waitress was right over when our glasses were low to refill them. Highly recommend and will return next time I'm in town.",

Only downside I see is that there aren't any private tables.  The Saketinis were delicious! I tried the pomegranate and lychee and would highly recommend the lychee.  The rolls were delicious, and if youre a raw food/sashimi fanatic, definitely try out the Rose Roll!  My server was very attentive and continuously checked in/out with me and my SO.  If you're drunk or hungry at 2AM and you're looking for an amazing sushi restaurant, then stop by at Kaizen!",

The thing that threw me off was the tempura shrimp bento was solid minus the tempura part. Instead of traditional tempura batter, they used the same batter as that of the chicken katsu which was a big let down for me as it was not as I had expected. My girlfriend had the pork katsu which bowl which was excellent as I picked off her plate as well as mine. If your in the area, give this place a try. I do hope though the tempura shrimp thing was a fluke and it was because they ran out of the proper batter. Otherwise, it would be a big strike against them as far as I am concerned.",

I came here simply because I was staying across the street at HRH and it was a walking distance for a drunk person. I got tired of burgers and pizzas, and I wanted something different. This place had teriyaki bowls at $8.95 a bowl. It wasn't a restaurant quality teriyaki bowl as I expected. Infact I have had way better ones in Socal at mom and pop places. However I m must say I do like the ambiance of this place. They got a sports bar style counter setup with some flat  screens. And behind the bar were the chefs making sushi on the fly. If I was into Sushi, I would definitely come here.  I was just so hammered that day where raw fish would've been a trip killer.    This place is definitely worth checking out if you need a good walking distance munchies spot from the HRH.",

In case you didn't know, sushi rolls were invented in korea, not japan), they serve Japanese food, but not traditional Japanese cuisine, if that's what you're looking for (try Ichiza). I came here for sushi, and to my dissapointment, the sushi was not fresh, I've been here twice and both times the fish was old.. From tuna to uni, the sushi was old and dry. Not to mention the size of their cuts.. For the price they charge they should at least make up for quantity. I've had an order of $6 nigiri that filled me up more than their $22 chirashi bowl (mix sushi bowl). Ok maybe not... but you get the idea.. The only reason why they dont deserve a 1 star review is the fact that they have friendly people working there, and they are open later than most sushi places in vegas (they close at 4am).. so prepare to order a couple of Sapporo's and Sake, and hope it makes the food taste better.",

Both times the food was tasty- our favorite was a  salmon roll topped with a creamy sauce and macadamia nuts, and this has been the only place to have it. But at $20 per roll, it's the kind of place we go to only when we'll be sharing with many people. It's close to my work and open late, which is great considering I get off work around late some days- but if I can't afford to eat there then it's not a viable option.   The interior is nice, with long wooden tables and an open feel despite the small size. The music doesn't really jibe with the asian food theme, and there are large TV screens along some of the walls playing random video.  Overall the food is tasty but expensive. For the same price range I could have multiple courses at Ichiza. The salmon killer roll IS especially good, so I would go back for that sometime, but expect the bill to run a bit high. It can also be awkward navigating out of the parking lot given the location and all the one-way streets.",

If you're going to do that, take that sign out on the front. Otherwise, it's just dishonest, and super irritating.  Ordered to share: miso soup, rock and roll, silver state roll, and the scallop volcano roll. Scallop volcano roll was def the fave and hope to find something at home like it.",

Michael was our server and we applaud him for putting up with us...he was attentive and laughed at our bad jokes. The ambiance wasn't too casual and not too fancy, which was perfect even though we were pretty dressed up. The sushi was DELICIOUS, fresh and nicely prepared. Two girls in our party ordered the miso soup with lobster and loved it. The sushi we ordered was great and filling. The best part about this place was that it wasn't that busy. We assumed it would get busier later into the night, since they are smart and stay open until 6am.   I plan on returning again to this cute spot off the strip when I'm back in Vegas.",

I think if you go upscale make the chopsticks upscale too and stop cutting down trees. The menu is huge!!!!   Ok so the BBQ roll isn't good to me. The meat was chewy. Too chewy I swallowed many bites whole because I couldn't break it down. Crunchy roll was good. Tried the crazy boy it was interesting. Not bad but I just didn't like it. I had ordered the Katsura roll to try it but it never came. They charged me for it and then I told them I never got it. They took it off.   Ok so here is where I get picky. One if I order something bring it to me. Two 3 different people came up to our table asking if we are done eating and paid yet. Seriously I ordered rolls a few times relax and let me eat or wait for the goof.  When I'm done eating I'll let you know. And three when we walk in and I tell you we want a table instead of sushi bar don't suggest the sushi bar over and over.",

Overall great, experience.",

I've gotten it twice now and it's so good.   - rainbow roll: again, the fish is just so fresh.  I will continue to try diff rolls and update review.",

I've been here a few times after a night out on the strip, I don't know how exactly, but I've made it. I've had rolls and noodles and have enjoyed both with friends.  However, after coming here for a late night [sober] dinner recently I came to realize it really is a good sushi spot away from the strip. Especially since they have great deals - it was half off when we went for dinner.  It's good food, a great deal, chill atmosphere and great service. I must admit though, that i give them extra props for being open late and still delivering great service at such a late hour.",

All of the rolls were pretty good, but the real standout was Japanese lasagna. it tasted different from Sushi-mon's or even Yama's because it tasted more like it should be called 'Japanese Mac N Cheese'. it was refreshing and interesting tasting.  The Gyoza was not as awesome. I'm not a fan of deep-fried gyoza. This place definitely hit the spot for my sushi craving. However upon leaving the restaurant i realized it wasn't the same as Yama sushi. Still good, but not the same.",

Probably because spending $35 for two people is a little much for lunch hour. lol  It could be worse.  I got the lunch special California Roll with salad and miso soup.  Pretty good.  California Roll was really small but Im not really expecting much for it being the lunch special.  My friend got some sort of dragon roll and sashimi.  Her roll was much bigger than my baby Cal roll.  Both she said was pretty good.  My one gripe for this place is that they don't serve white meat chicken!  I love myself a teriyaki chicken but not with gross dark meat.  I understood back in the day the cheap way to go for these places is the dark meat, but now in a health cautious world a place such as this should have white meat for Gods sake.   Anyways, food pretty good.  Service good...they guy actually remembered I needed a fork for my salad. hehe  The place is always empty for the most part.  I sometimes wonder why being that its across the street from the Hard Rock.  So yeah just an \"okay three star review\" because of the \"no white meat\".  Get with the times Kaizen!",

I read many reviews before opting to come here. I can't imagine even going to an AYCE sushi restaurant.

Everyone on my group was craving sushi so we decided to hit this place because it was close, in a little shopping center across from the Hard Rock.  It's small but don't let that fool you.  We were quickly seated and orders were taken right away.  Talk about great sushi. Everything we had was great. I had a dragon roll and crunch roll. There prices are pretty good for the quality and size of your rolls.  Pineapple sakitini is a great cocktail to order.    I almost forgot that they stay open until at least 4am everyday, a must for vegas if you are into hanging out late. So if you have a late night craving stop it.  If you haven't had enough to drink they have buy one get one free.",

We ordered two hot teas and NEVER got them, but was still charged for it. The sushi rolls were good. The food is good don't get me wrong. But the waitresses that work here don't even want to be there.  Some other waitress that wasn't even helping us in the first place got us water. And apologized for her coworkers mistake. Wait why are you apologizing...? The Asian waitress should be apologizing. Anyways I definitely will not be coming back. Management needs to check up on this because several people are complaining about the service.   On top of all that another customer walks I'm after us and gets his drinks and food before us? Thanks for the slap in the face.  This place has a Japanese name, but definitely Korean owned.  I suggest to order togo to avoid this situation.",

Other than that, I do love their baked rolls. I would definitely recommend the baked lasagna. Super duper good. If you're into tempura roll I would recommend the crazy boy roll. 8 pieces for only 7 bucks! I love the eel sauce. The food is great overall. For service wise, it's fair.

The waiters and waitresses are always happy. They are always welcome us with a smiley face. Our servers always know what we drink, but for curtesy, they always checking on our orders, asking if we like something else. Mostly we drink iced tea. They serve passion fruit tea, always very fresh. We tried the Sake (Lychee flavor) first time. It's great flavor, kind of sweet, but good, if you like sweet drinks.  My favorite items are: Sexy Rolls; Nevada Rolls; Crunchy Scallops Rolls. I don't always eat raw fish, so I am happy to order the above mentioned. Those rolls are a very fine balance with great flavor.  Besides the rolls, I really like the Seafood Curry Udon. Personally, I don't eat very spicy food. So, I asked them to make sure the curry is very low, and a sauce is very light on my udon. They prepare it perfectly for me. BF likes the Chicken or Beef Curry Udon. Both of the meals are in great balance of either the seafood or meat and vegetables over the Udon (noodles) and the curry sauce.  For dessert, I really liked their deep fried green tea ice cream. It's a huge portion, so it can be easily shared.   Love their recently remodeled dining room! The white chairs are making the restaurant look much nicer than before. The atmosphere is great. Music sometimes louder than I like, but high energy, so it doesn't bother me!  I noticed some art/paintings are displayed on the walls, and they are for sale. So if you like them, you can purchase it!",

Once I saw the great reviews, I couldn't pass it up, no matter how full I was. So we stopped in to sit at the bar and just have a drink and two rolls, rather than my usual boat of sushi and sashimi. We got the Paradise and Ninja rolls and I liked the Ninja Roll, but I loved the Paradise Roll. It's rare that I order rolls, and when I do, I'm always disappointed in the lack of flavor and heat. I'm not a fan of reviewing a place after just getting drinks or just getting an app, but these were both so full of flavor that I just had to add a review.",

However the rolls are a bit smaller than other sushi places I've been to. The food is good though & comes out rather quickly regardless of what the wait staff tells you. The wait staff is a bit slow at times even when it's not peak hours. Try a saketini if you get a chance they taste a bit like sangria. If you're like me & order a Sapporo you expect it to come w/ a beer glass chilled not a Modelo Especial glass. Deduction of points on that fro me. The atmosphere is well lit. You can sit at a booth area or at a table. The tables are picnic style so you could be rubbing elbows w/ neighbors during busier hours.  If you're a local this place a bit pricier than other sushi restuarants for less of the food. Again great food, just need to eat more to be full. Normally 2 rolls & an app w/ a beer will fill me up. It took 3 rolls & an app w/ a beer to fill me up here.  Tried 9 rolls last night out of our group: Shrimp Killer - Good Spicy Rainbow Roll - VERY GOOD Teriyaki Roll - Not so good Silver State Roll - SO GOOD Dragon Roll - ok Avacado Roll - ok Tiger Roll - Good Firecracker - SO GOOD",

I usually NEVER sit at the bar, but it looked inviting , and very casual, it was a friday night, around 11pm or so. They were playing techno music, I actually like the atmosphere. My date and I came in a for quick bite, and this was pretty fast and not very expensive. Both time that I have been there it has not drained my wallet for what i got. 1st time here i got a shrimp tempura roll ( 7bucks), not bad. and a cucumber roll(4 bucks). My date got the shrimp killer. ( around 8). Not bad at all.   Second time I went i ordered to go, and I got a vegetable tempura roll,(7bucks) which i found to be VERY GOOD! They put avocado in it. I tried the spicy scallop roll, but I did not care for it. It has some kind of a red mixture, somewhat like tomato. I dont know. I have had better. Everything else was very good!. Shrimp tempura roll. vegetable tempura roll. scallop roll, cucumber roll all came out to 24 dollars to go. I know i dont order extravagant rolls but thats cause im allergic to some of the stuff in those. So for me veggies rolls are wonderful. Ill prob come back again, because they pay attention to my fish allergy. I come here alone sometimes after work, and I never feel weird. The sushi chefs talk to me, and they said they would remember my allergy if I came back, that makes me feel SO GREAT!",

All the ingredients came together well and the slightly spicy, slightly vinegary sauce really added some kick and acid while letting all the flavors of the fish and shrimp and lobster come through. Staff was friendly, attentive and efficient. Prices were reasonable. Overall I would definitely come here again and recommend it to friends.",

Your money is worth at this place. Not to crowded maybe because it's a Thursday but no doubt I really enjoyed the food. Thanks for a nice dinner.",

I love that they play current music and have a large projector screen that plays the music videos with them. Makes for a cool yes intimate atmosphere. I recently celebrated my husband's surprise birthday dinner there, and I forgot candles for the cake and they provided some and lit the candles / brought the cake out for me! All of the servers are very pretty Asian girls which I love. Our favorite things to order are the Silver State Roll ( AMAZING!!! and different! ), jalapeno yellowtail, and I love their seaweed salad. But everything is good. Their lobster dynamite is also great, IF you like mushrooms.",

I would always get a katsu bowl ($8.95, I believe for the price).  It is pretty good and my favorite bowl that they have.  I have tried the beef bento-box that they offer but it was not very good.  The service is great, the host is very personable and knows my by name since I used to go there on a daily basis.

    "text": "In essence...  No AYCE. Overpriced because it is so close to the Strip. $60+ with tip for 2 people.  My husband and I managed to land here for sushi on a Friday night. We did this because the line for Yama Sushi (which is my fave sushi spot in town) had a line waaaay out the door and to be honest I just did not want to wait that long. So. Enter Kaizen, which had good Yelp reviews, but alas, was somewhat of a disappointment.   First with the good, the place LOOKS fabulous. Dark exterior, plays with lovely lighting and the tables are large with good spacing. Dinnerware and presentation is superb, but it better be since this place is so close to the Strip. Customer service is so-so. Although the entire staff yells as people enters/leaves, our service with food to our table was only okay. I ordered a hot green tea and it was brought out in a large cup, which I dislike because I enjoy my tea HOT. As it sits uncovered it cools down quickly and not once did a server ask to refill it. I prefer smaller cups and pots of tea for this reason.  Ordered:  - Edamame  - California Roll - Tuna Roll  - Shrimp Roll - Spicy Rainbow Roll - Spicy Tuna Hand Roll  Pluses - size of rolls at least (kind of) make you not feel so bad about how much you are paying and that you cannot get AYCE here. PLUS, again, presentation is great and sushi is very good quality. The only qualm I had was with the Tuna Roll being a bit on the warmer side when it arrived at our table than I would have liked.  My husband is a super picky sushi eater (hence the very plain rolls we had). The place does have some interesting rolls, the spicy rainbow roll was decent, and large, I'm glad I ordered it as it did fill me up.  BEST - Edamame, just stinking amazing for some reason. Served steaming, with a good amount of salt, and a LARGE portion.  Not the best... again, price wise you can find just as good sushi elsewhere and Vegas, except you don't have to pay for the atmosphere and Jay-Z music videos in the background.... HOLY GRAIL!!!",

First rolls came quickly and were fresh and delicious, then we waited...and waited...and waited for nearly half hour until one of the SushiYa behind the counter asked how we liked our rolls. Told him we hadn't gotten them all, another 15 minutes and there it was. No apologies from the staff for what was obviously an oversight on their part. When it was time to leave another 15-20 mins to get our bill. Will go back again, hoping service improves by then.",

    "text": "Almost all of my sushi experiences these days are AYCE, so it was nice to go out for a few rolls and know I didn't have to prep for stuffing myself. Prices are definitely high given Kaizen's proximity to the Hard Rock Hotel and ordering two rolls will easily set you back for more than a typical AYCE dinner. However, I do think the quality of ingredients is better, the rolls are thicker, and there's a little more effort put in to justify at least some of the price.   The restaurant is hip and modern despite its Strip Mall location. There's weren't many customers on a Tuesday night but it did look like most of them were tourists. We sat at the bar and ordered the Shishito Pepper appetizer to start. I was surprised by how many peppers they gave us. They were served with bonito flakes on the side, which I wasn't quite sure what to do with. Do I eat them on top of the peppers? Between bites of the peppers? I ended up drizzling soy sauce on the flakes and eating them with the peppers, making it easier to stick together. We also ordered the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna (always a favorite), Katana Roll, and TT Girl Roll. The Katana had just the right amount of heat and the sauce served with it tasted like Cool Ranch Doritos. I do think it was ranch based, and I never knew how well ranch goes with sushi, though what doesn't go well with ranch...? My boyfriend enjoyed the T.T. Girls roll, I liked the eel on top but thought it was a little too saucy.   Overall a pleasant experience at Kaizen. Don't go in thinking you have to eat like you would at an AYCE place. It was a lot of food and I was thoroughly satiated at the end of the meal. This is certainly a cheaper option than eating at Nobu at HRH, but if you're trying to really get down on some sushi and don't care too much about quality or ambiance, there are plenty of AYCE sushi spots just behind UNLV that may serve your wallet and appetite better.",

I sadly didn't take any pictures because I totally thought I had reviewed this spot before.      I definitely recommend it. I always the white rose roll, Tako sashimi, and the tempura green tea ice cream. I did order additional items this time, the unicorn roll and a tempura appetizer.      The unicorn roll was good. The tempura was not the best I've had, but I've been to Japan comparatively, and not a lot of tempura here meets that quality. Not all tempura is created equal! Lol.      Our group ordered probably about 5 or 6 other rolls that everyone shared and nothing was disappointing. This place always delivers and they're open super late night.     Another biggie is their fish quality! It's great, never any questions or concerns about freshness.",

Having lived in Vegas, there's no shortage of good sushi in town but good sushi near The Strip at a reasonable price with great service? Here's your destination. Everything is fresh, nothing was fishy, and over two weeks, we sampled nearly half the menu, I'd figure. Don't let the strip mall fool you -- this place is great and locals and tourists alike will be in for a pleasant surprise.",

Girls Roll and the Rock & Roll roll. All of the them were delicious. My favorite was the T. T. Girls roll. If sushi can be \"comfort food\" than that's what the T.T. Girls roll is for me. We definitely dodged a bullet tonight! We were headed to the Ra Sushi Restaurant till I read all the poor reviews. Thank you Stefanie M. For this fabulous recommendation!! You won't be disappointed here! Afterwards we went to Insomnia Cookies for a little dessert. Best cookies ever!!!",

    "text": "Yoooooooo this place is the bomb! Im a big fan of AYCE which they offer here, which is awesome!   Let me be completely up front and honest here, I've been seeing 1 sushi restaurant for years(which will remain unnamed), rarely straying from the exclusivity of our unity.   The story goes Kaizen is right down the street from my girlfriends house. Naturally I was a little hesitant to go here, what would my other sushi house think? Would they find out? Would they be mad at me, jealous?! I was a complete mess and stressed out about the situation. Non the less I still went. I nervously ordered the AYCE, immediately putting in an order for a few rolls, then I waited. Within no time my rolls started to be quickly delivered to me. After taking the first bite of the First Kiss roll all my nerves melted away and I was suddenly in a sushi heaven. I'll never forget that first delicious tempura roll from Kaizen, the First Kiss was very much a First kiss from Kaizen to my taste buds.  The Nigiri was so satifying and delicious it may have been made by God himself. Seriously I think God took the form of a sushi chef and made sushi at Kaizen that day. Everything was so delicious, amazing service, friendly staff, and I'm pretty sure god works there on occasion when he's board which happened to be the day I went.   What are you waiting for?! Go to Kaizen now! The main thing I learned from all of this is that there is room in my life for two sushi houses. I will be back to see you soon my sweet sweet Kaizen.",

And the fact that this is not AYCE, their portions should be a lot bigger. This place tastes like an average AYCE place -nothing special. The one nice thing are the hours. At 2 in the morning we wanted sushi and went here. I guess if you're walking by this place and want some sushi, go. But otherwise you are missing absolutely nothing.",

We're helped right away and given some suggestions and their best sellers. Their menu is so BIG. We just went with what was suggested. Some of their maki rolls were not traditional but they were very good. I enjoyed my meal as did the rest of my party. Highly suggest this place if are out late and are craving Japanese cuisine. Also they have unlimited passion fruit ice tea!!  Would I return to the place? Most definitely. This place exceeded expectations",

Wait staff was great in accommodating this very rude group of friends. If your friends yell very loud inappropriate sexual things that may or may not disturb the other diners, this place will still not kick you out! Believe me, they are great!   Do not under any circumstances order the baked scallops or some roll with jalapenos on top of it! Both my friends said those two items were gross. However, the roll I ordered that has ponzu sauce on it was delicious and I heard the Poke is phenomenal so could be hit or miss. The menu has excellent pictures so you can use your best judgement to make the right decision. Although, making right decisions and being in Las Vegas usually don't go together.",

Kaizen is a very great sushi spot especially for one of the best HAPPY HOUR spots to go to after 12am-4am when your hungry and drunk! Can't beat a buy1get1 for Beer and Sake and $2 Hand Rolls!!  Workers: Very friendly staff and theyre always down to drink with you especially the chefs!! They always make sure you have a great time!  Menu: Its SUSHI!! Its a bit pricey but its worth! Try it and let me know! \"First Kiss Roll\" is my favorite Special Roll on that menu.. Pretty much everything on the menu is a great pick and I always bring all my out of towners to this spot and they always ask me to take them back again!  Location: Right across of Hard Rock Hotel and down the street from the Macarran Airport! Cant ask for any better. Better than it being off the strip than on the strip or in a high end Casino!  Check it out!!",

The waiter did not sat us down. He just went off and lay down the menus without even a heads up that it was our table. Seems like he really wanted us to leave, since he came by every minute to ask if we were ready. When we were finally ready to order, the waiter was glancing out the door and was waiting for other customers, which was so rude. One of the workers had to personally go up to the waiter and tell him that we wanted to order. Never experience this kind of situation in my life but it is what it is.   The food tasted great. If you order stuff that is not in the menu book, the portion is quite big. The busser would always come by and refill our drinks, which was very nice of him.   When more customers come in, the waiter paid even less attention to us. One of us had to stand up and get him so we can have the same attention as others.  Overall I like their food, but seriously the service is horrible.",

The eastern location is better though bc they do have the half price sushi but still.  Their sushi is high priced, and they dont have all you can eat, so you end up spending a fortune.  The few good things I've had were the jalapeno roll, which was actually really good, but I feel this place is more 'americanized' sushi which I hate.  I love authentic food, but this place is just ok.  I hate to give a less than spectacular rating, but I've never had a great meal from here.  If you come here for late night sushi, hit up musashi! Its down the road on paradise and way better! They have happy hour EVERY night from 11pm-3am.    The service has always been good, but the food is just ok to me.",

The menu was a bit overwhelming since it was our first time there. The server was very nice and great service. She made a few suggestions and they were so good! Their prices are typical of sushi places. Anywhere from $10 and up per roll.   We tried a baked scallop roll that was full of scallops. The don't skimp on their ingredients and I love that. I tired a lobster and crab roll wrapped in halibut...FRESH! We also tried their banana roll. Different because it was slightly sweet and savory.   I love the fact that there are real Japanese people working there and making sushi. Maybe it makes it feel more authentic. You just feel like you get the whole experience versus a Mexican guy making the sushi for you. Even though he probably has no problems making delicious sushi.",

We got seated really fast and we were kinda excited about the menu since there was a lot of variety. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 rolls since we usually get that amount of rolls at other sushi restaurants thinking it will fill us up. Once my friends and I got our sushi, we were pissed off because the sushi had like 4-6 rolls. We just looked at each other like are you freakin' serious? I had to order another sushi roll because it obviously did not fill me up. When we got our check, it was about $105 since it included gratuity already. My friends and I ended up putting $120 instead of $105 since none of us had change. So we're waiting..and...waiting for our change. The workers during that time were giving us dirty looks cause we were still there and probably wanted to clean our table. So it finally hit us, where the fuck is our change? We asked the lady if we can get our change back and she gave us a dirty look. That bitch thought that extra $15 of our \"change\" was her damn tip. Like really? The tip that was on the receipt was already $15. So this restaurant tried to get a $30 tip from my friends and I when there was only 6 of us. Really? $5 tip from each person when the food didn't even fill us up? Shake my head at those workers man.",

And it's the only place any of the bartenders, waitstaff, hosts, taxi drivers, and security guards at Wynn, TI, The Venetian, or Fashion Show mall knew about....  so I'll go ahead and declare this the latest-open sushi place I've ever been to on this continent.  (If you know of anything open later in Norcal, DC, or LV, message me.)  The taxi ride here from the strip was all of like $7.  Of course we spent more than that, because we first tried Tao for sushi, but it was closed.  Then Social House - closed.  Then Ra: cerrado.  Then Hamada: shut, barely.  Then here, after burning a few hundred walking calories and a yuppie food stamp on the taxi.  Once we got here, the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  And the place was actually about a quarter full - with the younger party-looking set.  No one raving drunk though.  The nigiri was a bit more expensive than that would've-been-$7 taxi ride per pair but not exorbitant for Vegas.  Not the cheapest or best I've had, but the salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna nigiri were all fresh enough and they did have some delicious, albeit very thinly sliced toro ($19/pair), again at 3am.  I mean if someone can satisfy my sushi craving at 3am on a Monday night making the fish taste good is gravy.  They also had some white tuna that is the \"pure white\" type we geigens love and large bottles of Kirin.  And we couldn't help but notice a group of 4 at the bar doing sake bombs dominoes style (which the undergrad in me says looked pretty cool I must admit).    I doubt 3am sake bombs are even legal in Cali.  Along with most other things in this town.  Viva Las Vegas.",

The Lowdown:  - HAPPY HOUR starts at midnight (!!!) Prior to midnight this place might be empty, and it sometimes begins to fill up late on weekdays.   - FOOD - High quality ingredients. Albacore & salmon sushi melt in your mouth. Actually, everything we've tried is delicious. The shishito pepper appetizer didn't disappoint (a personal favorite, which I often use to help gage the overall quality at sushi joints). I'd say this place is comparable to ever popular Katsu-Ya in LA.  - HUGE MENU It takes a while to peruse the entire menu and get a feel for the many specialty rolls - there's something for everyone.  - LOCATION I like the fact that this is an off-strip, \"locals' favorite\" type of place.  Very cool, un-touristy crowd.  - PRICES Its surprising to know that so many people think this place is expensive. Haven't you noticed that EVERYTHING in Vegas is expensive?!? In terms of sushi prices I'd say this joint is average, and the Happy Hour prices are a real bargain!  * WARNING * CHECK YOUR BILL! I'm docking half a point because the last time we were here they \"forgot\" to charge us Happy Hour prices, and gave us a bill with regular prices instead. NOT cool. Of course they fixed it when we spoke up, but if not for this incident Kaizen would be nearly perfect  :(",

I usually am, but this one had a pretty heavy batter on it much like the cheap frozen breaded shimp you can buy at the grocery store. Overall it was pretty good, and the staff was very friendly. They were out of large Sapporos, so they brought me 2 small ones...at the same time...I probably looked like a lush double fisting it in a sushi bar, but I dont mind that. :) The menu had alot of very interesting and different combinations of sushi that I'll have to go back and try sometime.

My group started with the grilled ika which came with a spicy sauce and this awesome scallop mushroom app that was in a cream sauce topped with a charred cheese - do delicious, I just wish I had some to scoop the extra sauce. Then we had a few roll by then the scarring that occurred from the fat bikini was gone. But we stayed for dessert - fried tempura cheesecake and deep fried ice cream.",

I was staying at the Hard Rock and wanted some sushi. Had Hamada's 2 nights prior (see review) and it was horrible. Had to redeem myself.  Service:  Tons of staff to the point that you will always have someone at your needs.  Good job Team Kaizen.  Now for the food.  Tried their Spicy Tuna, Chicken Katsu w/Brown Rice, Baked Salmon,and Caterpillar Roll.  All were tasty, fresh, not fishy, and made to order. My co-worker had a special roll created exactly how he wanted it.  Always good when they can improvise.   Can't wait to try the location in North Las Vegas.  Only issue with this place is that they lack AYCE. But they stated they were better than the north location.  We'll see, I will be the judge",

    "text": "I wish I could say that I was drunk and stumbled upon this sushi joint... but instead, I came here to grab a take-out lunch while I was staying at the Hyatt Hotel supervising a group of tourists to a trip to Vegas.  It would have made it much more entertaining if I did.  In any case, Kaizen Sushi is not a bad place to get your sushi fixing in Vegas.  They specialize in fusion rolls, so right off the bat, you know that you should focus more so on them instead of simply nigiri or sashimi.  The atmosphere inside reminded me of a very fancy bar, both very dark and roomy.  They have a pretty sweet deal for those night owls (or those trying to be) where much of their food becomes half off.  Considering that this place is open late, this place is definitely for those post-clubbing events.  For my mini lunch, I ordered the Calamari Tempura Roll, which came out to be about $8.  I love eating fried squid, and was interested in seeing their take on combining it into a sick sushi roll.  What I really loved about this roll was that even though it came in only five pieces, they gave me the extra calamari on the side.  It also came with a sweet dipping sauce.  My roll was okay.  Nothing to rave about to be honest, but it was a good way for me to get my sushi fixing for the day.  Everything else on the menu seems to be way overpriced, especially in Vegas when there are so many other eating bargains out there.  Definitely worth a try, but go ahead and gamble at Hard Rock and make some moolah first before you come here.  Then you can fest like a KING/QUEEN!  Parking is available outside in the plaza.",

All the other late night sushi places seem to close at 2.  Sat down at the bar, at 3:10am the place was surprisingly seated with about 10 other late night eaters. I ordered 2 rolls: King of Ocean Roll (topped with lobster, shrimp, tangy sauce and contained avacodo, asparagus, cucumber) & Sunrise Roll (salmon,avacodo on top, with spicy tuna inside and ponzu sauce).  The food was satisfying and tasted fresh, moreover very satisfying.  Service was friendly and prompt, 2 young Japanese sushi chefs working at the bar preparing the sushi.  Waitresses were young and cute, overall a very satisfying experience and exactly what I was hoping for.",

I just flew in for another convention and this is the first place I stopped. I think the service was great the sushi was Fresh and location is great right next to CVS for me to pick up some stuff before I get to the over priced hotels.

Suffice to say, we ordered Uni and it was the worst mistake we could have made. It was spoiled!! I immediately spit mine out in my napkin and my wife ended up swallowing hers out of respect and embarrassment of not making a scene. I feel very bad for her and upset with this establishment. They should have known better than to serve rotten Uni. Uni is best within three days. Their Uni must have been over a week old judging by the  texture, smell, and horrible taste from being spoiled. Well the next day my wife started feeling sick and her condition has gotten worse as the day progressed. Fever, vomit, and so on without embarrassing her more. The worst part is we were on vacation and the last day of our trip she got sick. She hasn't been able to eat all day.  I hope she gets better soon. They comped only the rotten Uni. They should have comped our whole meal and then some for what they are putting my poor wife through.",

I like to get the Unagi Bowl and Miso Soup if I'm trying to get something quick to eat. The presentation of the Unagi Bowl is great and it taste absolutely delicious. My favorite roll here is the Rattle Snake Roll and I get it every time I go. I recommend the Salmon Skin Hand Roll or the Philadelphia Hand Roll, bare in mind that their hand rolls are pretty large! They also offer extremely fresh nigiri and they always have a special fresh fish for the day so be sure to ask! When they have special fishes for the day, they are indeed special because I cannot find some of these fishes at any other sushi restaurants. The Hamachi Kama is also a must, it's perfectly seasoned and grilled and it practically melts in your mouth. They are getting ready for a new location at the Linq so they have been training new waiters so be patient if you get one of the new ones! The sushi chefs are also amazing and have fun personalities if you're sitting at the bar. They like to drink, dance and sing while making sushi! Note, this place is a bit pricy because of the quality but it's worth it!",

    "text": "Last meal in Vegas before heading back to LA. Kaizen was really close to our hotel and on the way to the freeway.   It wasn't very busy when we got there so we were seated and served right away. We ordered the sashimi lunch combination, the first kiss roll, and the tokyo roll. The server said she accidentally poured two soups instead of one (claiming that the lunch special comes with one soup). She scored brownie points with that move.   The sashimi combination was alright. The slices of fish were decent. Not the Best sashimi I've ever had but it hit the spot.  The first kiss roll was pretty scrumptious. Not entirely sure what sauce it's served on top of but it was absolutely delightful.   The Tokyo roll looked scary. I've never seen a raw fish roll look so slimy before. But the server Shima informed us that there was a mustard ponzu dressing on top of it. Me and my boyfriend only ate half of the roll trying to stomach the unusual slime but the waitress insisted that she still discount the roll from the bill.  To make up for the Tokyo roll, our server brought out a deep fried green tea ice cream covered with whipped cream, cherry and drizzles with chocolate sauce. Never having tried this concoction, we were pleasantly surprised with such a treat. Thanks Shima!",

    "text": "Kaizen sits across from the Hard rock hotel nestled in the corner of the CVS plaza. Between Capriotti's and Ferraro's Italian.   Here is the breakdown according to me. It's in my area.. it's slightly over-priced sushi.. and the service is sometimes good, sometimes they forget things.. lol.. what do you want from a place that is often pumping until 5 am.   We head over there for a late night sushi fix, and most importantly.. the 2 for 1 .. ANYTHING from the bar.. after midnight. Usually that equals cheap sake and beer.. but it does the trick for cheap. Also I always see Carrot top there.. which is good or bad? You tell me.. it just is :]   You can find me there on any given evening with a crew or just me and one of my foodie buddies.. mostly for me it's about the liquor and the broiled yellow tail fish collar. Yes... you read that right. if you don't know, now you know.. check it out. It's not that you can't get fish collar at other Asian style eateries, but this one is close by so I'm there most :)  Happy Eating!",

But it was about as good as the sushi you might get pre-made from a grocery store.  \"Mediocre\" is the best I could possibly rate it.     The decor in the restaurant was beautiful; a lot nicer than I would have expected for a strip mall restaurant.  And the service was fine.  But the menus were that cheap laminated stuff you find in low-end Chinese restaurants, with poorly lit photos of the rolls.  And the descriptions were all so formulaic:  Inside - tuna avocado, on top - shrimp, sauce - ponzu.   They all read like that so that none of them stood out to you.  They all sounded pretty much the same.  But most importantly, of the 4 rolls we ordered, none were outstanding.  They were all just blah with a slightly fishy taste to the sushi.  I would NOT go here again and I would certainly not recommend it to anyone. We should have spent the extra $$ and gone across the street to Nobu (in the Hard Rock) for some seriously amazing sushi.",

I got the spicy tuna salad for which have tuna poke and seaweed salad along with an actual salad below and there amazing dressing. Worth it. Then I tried special roll which was great and it had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and yellowtail on top. Then I ordered just a basic spicy tuna roll and added cream cheese as  you can do that here. To top it off I have the mochi ice cream which is great! The only reason why this restaurant did not get 5 star is because the service was piss poor. Get more servers as a Sunday night, off the strip with great priced sushi is gonna be busy. Go here if you want some good sushi! :)",

I especially liked the cheers we got when we walked in, looking awesome I'm sure, after a night of excessive drinking and partying.  The place is a like a club that serves sushi.

Not having had sushi much, I told her to look at the menu, read all the descriptions and pick something with the type(s) of fish she likes. She did and ordered the Alaska roll which she said was really good. They have a great menu and I love how it's decorated. My only complaint is that sometimes the service is a tad slow, but they really do try their best, and that is ok with me. A lady next to me this last time was completely rude to the server but he didn't get upset and was able to pretty much turn it around, which was awesome.

Charged me $162 for absolutly mediocre sushi...stay away from this RIP OFF place. NOBU across the street, might be just as expensive, but the fish would be fresh and taste much better. A total rip off- NEVER again. If you go, don't say you weren't warned. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!",

I say if you are staying at Hard Rock and are in the mood for some good sushi go there.. prices are okay not too bad (compared to the bay area) lol...",

Kaizen got great reviews and was a quick drive from my hotel, so I called in an order and popped in. The food was okay, but not great. The sushi felt like it wasn't very fresh and it was completely warm by the time I got it home (to be fair, it was 100 degrees outside but the car ride was only 5 minutes and the AC was on... so I don't think that could have been the culprit!). Maybe eating in is a better bet for the future.",

If you're a big fan of mussels, their mussels are huge!!! I love it.  The decor is modern and very spacious. The restaurant is off the strip, but totally worth the trip out there.  Also opens until very late :) aka 4am... for all you party animals you.",

However, the base sauce that they put on the plate can be a little over powering to the point that's all you taste. It's not a bad taste, but it can make the flavor of each roll blend together. We got the Bomba for dessert and it was great! One can be split between two people. Overall a good experience and would come back.",

As noted by others it is open til 4 AM on most days which is a plus in Vegas. I was told by my friend that they have a DJ's performing during the late night.

Kaizen puts a little green onion, the orange eggs, and a ponzu sauce. still yummy and satisfying!  i'd definitely come back here again but only if im in the area for undftd/stussy or staying at the hard rock hotel.  also, come at night.. i think theyre popular for their sake specials during that time!",

Being from out of town and not being a fan of the vegas lime light. (I only go to vegas for work.)  this place is off the strip, across the street from the hard rock cafe/casino/hotel, in a corner shopping strip.  We asked our waitress (sarah) from Japonais inside the Mirage about a local place off the strip where locals go. She recommended this place.  HEY!

The service was fucking terrible. If you read my other reviews you will see that I am a very forgiving/reasonable person. The host was just plain uninterested and our server could give a shit less. The funny thing is we sat at the bar and the place was not busy. I was blown away, but my friend and I were craving sushi after a couple of drinks, so we decided to go for it.  We ordered a couple of beers and a couple of rolls, which were about 14$ a piece (kinda pricey) but really didnt care because I wanted to let loose. The rolls were really good; in fact we ordered about 5 more between the two of us.   Ok, so here is the problem.       <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.No&s=706527860d6f238ff7516936efb62dc44c57c3059cf43de326a6f4f4aa3a1f23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.No</a> interaction from the sushi chefs       2.The server had a piss poor attitude       3.I tried multiple times to get recommendations from server and chef with no luck....they just didn't give a shit.  Ive come to a point were i am so sick of incompetent people,uninspired people (hence the reason most of us yelp so we can find no bullshit, highly recommended places to go). Well the unfortunate thing about kaizen is that they have the ability to be great, but the service is just non existent. If this was an instance in which only the sever sucked, I could probably blow it off. But no, this was the whole fucking operation.     I will never come here again. I have never been so ignored or made to feel so insignificant at a restaurant in my whole life. I will give them 2 stars because the sushi was a sliver above average. Its a shame but the service was unacceptable. Oh and their prices just suck for what you get. Nothing but another glorified \"sushi restaurant\" in Vegas.",

I'd ordered the teriyaki beef bowl. It just taste like pei wei's food. We also got a udon...however we didn't know they had stir-fry. I thought udon was going to be in a soup. The flavoring of the udon tasted like the vietnamese saracha chilli sauce mixed with sweet and sour sauce. Absolutely gross.  Maybe their sushi rolls are better, but I think they'd overpriced their food and you could get better sushi at other place for better price.",

Alas the salad seemed to be just a generic salad that they bought at safeway/vons.  The Hamachi was fresh and the two pieces were nice and big.  I wasn't that hungry so I didn't try that many things.  Though the korean bbq roll was a nice try to something new, it wasn't that special to make me want to order again (may as well just get korean bbq shortribs with rice), as there are so many other rolls to try.  I'd go again, prices and quality are up to par, and this time I'd try the other rolls.  Good for rolls, decent for nigiri (it's no sasabune).",

Ordered the Baked New Zealand Mussels in Dynamite Sauce, Ika Yaki (Grilled Swuid), Crispy Soft Shell Crab for appetizers.  Very clean atmisphere but intimate with rigbt lightings. Decor is posh and modern. Love the local artist paintings on the wall. Our server was very welcoming, friendly and was nice to recommend off the menu. My family and I will be coming back again for sure.",

They say it's super spicy but it's perfect and not to hot.  There are more expensive sushi places, I'm looking at you Nobu, but they aren't worth the extra scratch.  Come here when in Vegas.  It's across the street from the hard rock and it's skipping distance to the double down saloon.  Great service and great ambience.  Come hungry! The portions are big.    Also don't just focus on the awesome sushi, their dinner plates, particularly the fresh fish, are worth ordering and are quite memorable.",

    "text": "so to start this review id like to say that the manager of the company never returned my phone call but did call my brother back who threatened to call the health department on them and responded without saying sorry or taking any responsibility for not 1 but 3 of the 4 people getting sick. But instead defended their food and any possibility of it happening. Nor did he offer any sort of reconcilement. Thursday morning at 3:45am we sat down and ate with a group of 4. 1 of which only ate her 1 roll but the 3 of us shared the rest. It took 2 hours for the stomach pain to start. An hour later is when I first began throwing up and the rest of the symptoms that come with food poisoning throughout the day and through the night. I was supposed to go to the lake thursday am and had to cancel that and had surgery planned friday morning which had to be rescheduled due to the pain and weakness i had. My brother called the restaurant on paradise where we ate, he never got a call bak until the next day he called again and said he would be calling the health department as stated and only then did he get a call back. The manager brought up the idea of us drinking alocohol, mind you i didn't drink as i needed to be up for the lake. Wasnt at all apologetic for the incident only tried basically putting the blame on everything but the restaurants food. I would also like to state that i posted on my instagram story about the incident and i had not 1 but 5 others stating they had gotten sick from the same company. So as of now i will be taking this into my own hands so i can let the public know about this company. I will be contacting the news station as well.",

    "text": "A funning thing about the name of this restaurant \"Kaizen\", according to my Japanese colleague, means continuous improvement of something and is the motto for Toyota motors.    They said nobody in Japan would name the restaurant \"kaizen\". I guess it's because it implies that the dishes are not at their best if you are constantly trying to improve.   Anyhow, this place is somewhat of a novelty for the Japanese because they usually do not see nor tasted American-style sushi rolls. We ordered the tuna poke, 16pcs sushi combo, 20pcs sashimi, calamari tempura roll and a spicy rainbow roll.  Nothing is really out of the ordinary. The poke tasted a bit odd but the sashimi and spicy rainbow roll were decent. A bit on the pricey side.  There's an overhead projection of random music and videos playing. A large bar on the side. The location was easy to find with plenty of parking.",

Decent but if you come and are looking for an appetizer I wouldnt go with this one, but nonetheless the food and sushi and service was good, so I would check it out if you're jonzing for a cool place and some good food.",

We haven't parked for 2 seconds yet and bums are already asking for money.  But this sushi place is nothing to write home about. Service was spotty....even though we came on a late Sunday night. After they brought us our drinks and water, we were ready to order some sushi rolls. We had to flag the waitress down, TWICE. It wasn't even busy!!! There were about 5-8 other tables. They didn't bother checking back on us....what if we wanted to order more sushi?!?! I totally would have by the way. We ordered a spicy tuna roll and also a Sunrise Roll. Sushi was delicious and their menu was never ending. I would've loved to try a few more...but DAMN...it was pricey!!!! Our sunrise roll was $13!!! Most of the sushi rolls ran from $10-14 per order. Umm, yeah...no. You're better off going into the heart of Chinatown or even further...(wayyyy further) off the strip for better priced sushi.  Also..side note: if you get cold like myself, BRING A JACKET WITH YOU!!!! They like to keep their fish and customers fresh and cold. Thought I was in their freezer box for a second.  Won't be coming back again. And this side of town is enough to scare the sushi out of me.",

    "text": "I'm not really sure why this place gets high reviews.  I must say I was highly disappointed. First of all the prices I felt were on the high side for the quality of the seafood. My wife ordered the 10 piece sashimi plate. It was the chefs choice. The waitress just placed the plate down and never said what kind of fish was on it.  My wife said some of the fish was good others seemed not so fresh and was very fishy. I had the rainbow roll and I would have to agree some of the roll was very good like the salmon portions, seemed fresh other parts of the the roll were very fishy almost bitter.  The California roll was good. I would highly recommend ordering the sauces on the side since they tend to over sauce the order. The service was good except for the server not telling us what kid of fish the chef brought us.  The house saki was actually very good and smooth.   There are many sushi restaurants in Vegas so I probably won't come back to this one since I question the freshness of the fish.",

One of my friends ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl and she likes it overall but she ended up asking for more sauce on the side. Another friend ordered a kastu bowl. She was expecting vegetables in the bowl but it was just the breaded chicken with rice. The katsu sauce that came with the bowl was tangy. A lot of different flavors were involved in the sauce, wasn't a fan. Overall it was decent food. We would love to cone back during happy hour to see what else they offer. Also, Richard was the BEST server! Make sure you ask to be seated in his section",

All I know is that the food at this location is great, the waiters are on top of everything, and the decor is flattering. Oh! Also it's literally within walking distance of UNLV.   If you're an avocado fan, get the Avocado Train roll. My friend ordered it and I was practically eating it for her. So yum!",

This is a busy night on a Sunday. I was starving and just wanted to eat. We sat at the sushi bar.  The servers were nice and courteous. They were patient while we reviewed the menu. I had my mind set on KBBQ so I was trying to figure out what I wanted. I went with sharing the spicy tuna roll and ordered the nabeyaki udon. This was surprisingly delicious! The server cracked the egg in the udon and I asked for their spicy sauce. Their sauce was so good! The spicy sauce definitely packs a kick and they warned us to start out with a little since it's hot. I loved it! Delicious. The udon noodles were perfect and the broth was good. I don't usually eat udon at restaurants since I like to eat this at home so this was a great surprise. Thank you for making my night!",

Changed my initial impression right away. Got seated quickly and was greeted by our server Ivan. He was is the reason for the 4 stars.   Impressive menu selections with pictures galore. They all looked so appetizing. Priced very reasonably for the rolls. They had my favorite appetizer of grilled shishito peppers. Comes with shaved bonito flakes.   Sushi started coming out quickly, the place was slow but we were there early too, like 5pm early.   Ordered a bunch of rolls and they were very reasonably priced, most under $10. I wanted to try the Unicorn roll (one of the more pricier $15 rolls). Said it had lobster topped and other goodies.   As the rolls started coming out, I observed the ones that had shrimp tempura, the tip of the tails were cut on a bias. This attention to detail was impressive. The shrimp was cooked right and remained crisp.   The next thing that caught my attention was the rolls that were advertised to have crab. They use imitation crab meat, a lot. That's one way to keep their prices low. I don't mind imitation crab meat as long as I knew they were described in the menu.   For dessert we had the green tea ice cream tempura. This one was a winner. The presentation was it was quartered thus exposing the layers and the inner goodness. Topped with whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate. Very well done and the ice cream was hardly melted.   Overall, the quality of the food was good (3 stars good) and the service pushed my rating up to 4 stars. I would go here again even knowing they like to use imitation crab meat. Price is right for what get.",

    "text": "Ambience: Solid A here. The lighting is dim, and makes for an intimate feel. Decor is simple with traditional Japanese and modern touches.  Service: It's an overall B to B-. The hostess and wait staff is friendly and just the right amount of attentive. Sushi chef was cold. I am so used to friendly, outgoing sushi chefs, so while he was by no means rude, his customer facing skills leave something to be desired.  Sushi: And of course the most important aspect of. Sushi restaurant. Unfortunately, this is a C to C+. As a frequent sushi nosher and lover or nigiri, I was more than a little disappointed. What I ordered: salmon, yellowtail belly, uni, and unagi. The unagi was the best of the 4. But honestly, it's pretty touch to mess up since its BBQ'd. Flavor was good, although the unagi sauce was cloyingly sweet. The salmon was second best. Standard. Not bad, but not great. Slightly flavorless. The yellowtail belly and uni were terrible. I was really looking forward to the buttery fattiness, but found it entirely flavorless and stale (the ends were hard which I've never experience with sushi). To be honest , I choked down the uni. Sad because it's one of my favorites to order. It had an odd metallic flavor that again, I've never experienced. Additionally, the nigiri itself was really sloppy. Most all fell apart as soon as I tried to pick them up with my chopsticks.  Wish I could have given it at least 3 stars, but the food quality is obviously a big factor. I've been here a few times, so this isn't based on a one time experience.",

We stuffed ourselves for about $40 each.  Lots of choices. Nicely divided menu by type of roll - fried, tempura, etc. Much better value than the high end places in the hotels nearby.  Open late so you can eat a nice meal after a very long day working.",

I ordered a few rolls, the ingredients were fresh but it just missed the mark. When you've had exceptional sushi in all parts of the US you know what your looking for. This place may be fun for late night or actually any time if your goal is to lap up the liquids as there was a really rowdy table in the place at 6pm. Lots of colorful loudness while one eats sushi, not my thing!",

The prices are not as bad as on the strip, but a little higher than off the strip. The sushi menu is very extensive with items you will not find at other sushi restaurants. There are a few all you can eat places in Vegas, which Kaizen Fushion Roll and Sushi is NOT. Overall, I always enjoy coming here and it is easy to find as it is in a plaza across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. They have a few TV's with sports on them usually, and play modern music. The Atmosphere is very modern and clean. I would recommend this place to someone looking for Fusion Sushi.",

    "text": "I was in town last weekend with friends celebrating my birthday (seriously, I'm still waiting on your presents...). I wanted to grab sushi, and not being a Vegas regular, knew I should check out Yelp to see where all you Vegas Yelpers are going.  Our party of 4 got in relatively early for dinner, about 5:00 on a Sunday, and we were the only ones there. We ordered about 10 different rolls, and they were served at a well staggered interval. I'd say 8 out of 10 were delicious, the other 2 average. The tuna, salmon, crab and more were all delish and fresh. We stayed for a few hours, I think we left after 8:00 since we were eating, drinking and having a great time. The wait staff were great, and were in no rush to get us out the door. In fact, they made sure to tell us they were open until 4 AM...so I guess we could've stayed for a while!  Ambiance was interesting. I dig the hip hop music and videos, and even though the place looks a little low budget inside, the food more than makes up for lack of decor.   Price was super reasonable, we ended up spending about $50 each, but that's with drinks, all of those rolls and a 25% tip. Great value. I will definitely visit this place again next time I'm in Las Vegas. Thanks Yelpers, for helping out a San Diegan in your fine city.",

Perhaps it was a big mistake to come to sushi hungry after indulging in quite a few drinks. Let's just say it would have been beneficial for us and our pocket books to do AYCE elsewhere. Between 3 of us, we graciously cashed out at $100 on sushi on individual rolls not AYCE. Well it wouldn't have been that bad, however, when most AYCE places are around $24 a person, it would have been cheaper to go elsewhere! The rolls were enjoyable but not mouthgasmic and overpriced. I do give them credit for surprising the birthday girl with a tempura green tea dessert, which we enjoyed greatly. I'll stick to my sushi joints off the strip.",

I also have a lot of friends who live in Vegas and work in the service industry.  As a result, I have tried a large number of sushi bars and restaurants both on and off Las Vegas Blvd.  A friend of mine who has lived in town for 18 years took us to Kaizen one night and we sat at the bar.  The food was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  The nigiri was average, but the rolls we had were nothing special.  It might have just been the night we went, but something did not seem right with the items that came from the fryer (like the tempura).  One plus is that the price was fair and the place was open late.  The service was friendly, but a bit slow.  Overall, I will not likely go back.  With so many options, this restaurant failed to make an impression and for the price point, I prefer Hamada down the road.",

The decor is modern and fun, which is a nice change from your typical sushi restaurant. The pricing of the items are reasonable and not too expensive which is nice.

When I have gone there by myself the sushi chefs are great at making you feel welcome and are very interactive, they are the same when I have gone with someone as well but are great for the lone ranger who's out looking for a great dining experience.

I went back to my hotel room and was pleasantly surprised. The fish was very fresh and the sushi rice was nicely seasoned. If I am ever back in town, I'd love to try their other food!",

Here was what my taste buds danced to:  - Salmon  *** Smoked salmon - Smoked salmon cut roll - Unagi cut roll ** Golden Knights cut roll - Seared tuna  The cold smoked salmon was my favorite. I could have sashimi'd that until the cows (fish) came home. It was lightly smoked but such a great flavor combo as a sushi option which I've never had before. My second fave was the Golden Knights roll which is similar to a CA roll but it had salmon & avocado thinly sliced on top and a creamy sauce that paired perfectly. What's great about Kaizen outside of the freshness of the quality is all of the sauces / way the sushi is dressed is perfectly paired.  Definitely will be back! Side note, if you show them your review you will get a free spicy tuna, ice cream, small sake, etc. I forgot what the other choices were. It was on a monitor, not on the actual page as a check-in.",

Last night we were seated quickly, service was very prompt. I asked for Tamari (gluten free soy) before we ordered explaining I cannot eat gluten.  I ordered the Silver State roll which contained crab. After eating 2 pieces I noticed it did not look like crab, but it was actually krab (imitation crab) which contains wheat/gluten. I asked the waiter and he said it was imitation Krab. He offered to bring something different so I ordered a Philadelphia roll and sent back the Silver State roll telling him it didn't say imitation or krab on the menu.  My husband and I went out on the strip and yes I did get sick within approx. an hour after leaving. My complaint is it should be labeled on the menu as imitation krab, not real crab.",

While she does believe she's had better, cheaper places (this was expensive to her, but I'm a California boy) this is still my go-to sushi place.   What's great is that the place closes late, so it almost doesn't matter what time of day (or night) it is.  If you want your sushi fixing, and want some quality along with it, near the strip -- this is the place to go to.",

Of course, as a Yelp Elite I stalked this page to see what I was going to eat before-hand.  I saw many pictures of a lunch special, so I decided to go with that.   Got to the restaurant and was seated with a regular menu, inquired about a lunch menu and was scoffed at saying, \"we do not have a lunch menu here!\"  Alright, pay-per-roll it is. We got 2 fancy rolls and 2 basic rolls (california & spicy tuna) to share. The total was $50....  Which confirms my theory that AYCE places have so much more value.   I can't stand places that just throws a stick of imitation crab meat into a California roll and serve it. This place does not actually make the crab-meat mix, with mayo, etc. This place was just MEH.",

The salmon was amazing  Price 3/5 You can get this quality sushi if you drive 15 mins away from the strip. Paying 9.95 for jalapeno poppers seemed absurd.   Overall food was good service was average.

I can't remember all of the names but they included salmon killer, shogun. and T.T Girls. The two rolls that the server surprised us with turned out to be our favorites (one was the orange blossom). So if you can't decide what rolls to get, trust your server, they would know best. They were super attentive and friendly as well, service was great. We devoured all the rolls so quickly between the 6 of us. I recommend coming here with a big group so you can try all the rolls.",

You can walk right across the street.   Service was good, I wouldn't say exceptional only because these types of restaurants only have 1-2 waitresses or waiters to help all the tables. Overhaul I would eat here again due to location and cost is reasonable.",

I went to pick up my order and the girl on the phone was a younger Asian girl who was the server/hostess. I didn't see much staff and she seemed pretty busy which explains why she was annoyed on the phone (still took her longer to sass me back rather than read me menu options).

Then we had the Kaizen scallop dynamite which is baked with mushrooms and cheese. I would have ordered another had we not ordered rolls. I'm a scallop fan and this was just mouth-watering good!

I remember i was drunk...and emotional. and drunk.... and a limo driver gave us a free ride.  He asked me where i wanted to go to. I said. SUSHI.  And luckily, without any attempt of harm, or kidnap or rape...we made it safely to the sushi spot...in a LIMO.  fly!  Tip: Girls. we just got lucky our limo driver isn't a douchebag. But do not attept to hop in, to any limo just because it's a dashing limo..I didn't think at that point. Thank god we didn't get killed in our short skirts.  Anyway....  So...my girlfriend and I ...along with our drunken hungry stomachs..ordered so much sushi, which we devoured in less than an hour....  Service on a saturday night was great. No long wait. and they are really friendly.  I had to take my boyfriend here....so we came back here on Monday...again....  What i've tried here so far..i really did like...  here we go: (this is from two nights of being here)  *First Kiss: Deep Fried Shrimp topped with soft shell crab, tuna and white fish.  It comes with a subtle tangy sauce with a flavor that's just about right without overpowering the natural flavor and tast of the fish.  *The \"O\" Roll: Chopped deep fried soft shell crab, spicy tuna and avocado, topped with Yellowtail.  As the name says.... This is a full blown Orgasm in your mouth. Definitely a must try. It gave me multiples. I had to order this twice.  *Palm Springs Roll: OMG. This is an orgasm within an Orgasm. Cubed Tuna in Spicy Mayo and Ponzy Sauce galore, with crab, avocado and cucumber. Soooo Goooooood. This is really amazing. We ordered this on our two nights we were at Kaizen.  *Kiss of Fire: If you like Spicy...you'll love this roll. Inside: there's crab, avocado and cucumber... Topped with Spicy Tuna, White Fish, Jalapeno. Sauce: spicy garlic ponzu and hot sauce..... Down this with Asahi or a shot of Sake. you're good.  *Kaizen Roll: Who doesn't agree that anything deep fried is just oh. so . good??? and unhealthy? whatever sushi pooper. This roll is a must try as well. IN: Deep fried soft shell crab, lobster, avocado, asparagus, yamagobo,cucumber, radish sprouts.. Topped with Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. sauce: eel sauce.  *Chicken Teriyaki Bowl: Even their Chicken Teriyako Bowl is not ordinary. It's yuuuummmmy!!!!  What i like about this Sushi Joint is that...it's not over-rated and doesnt try to be fancy shmancy like other sushi joints on the strip. They keep their quality and deliver freshness fish after fish..after fish. Service is fast and excellent. Prices are decent. Fish cuts are thick and generous. Selection is different and unique.  Definitely recommend this place to Sushi Lovers in Vegas!",

When I used to work on the strip Friday/Saturday and get off work at 4am we would always hit up this place routinely for some good food and a drink after work to wind down.   They have a nice sushi bar inside and plenty of tables for small or large groups. The lighting is dimmed a bit and there is always music playing giving off a fun vibe. I've become friends with quite a few of the staff that work here.  Good people, good service.   The food is really good and the rolls are good sized. They have some great rolls like Silver State, Orange Blossom, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Avacado Train, Super White Tuna is really good too. Everyone I have ever taken to Kaizen from out of state while visiting us has really enjoyed it.   There are a few Kaizen restaurants in Vegas but this one is by far my favorite. It is located right beside the Hard Rock Hotel 7 Casino.  When or if I start working on the strip at nightclubs again I will definitely be returning to Kaizen on the regular.",

We get here and there is a sign that reads 'Voted best sushi in Las Vegas.\" We are excited but when we walked in, it was empty at 1 PM on a Saturday and was reluctant to try.  I was pouting because I wanted AYCE sushi but the mister noted quality is more important than quantity and he was right!! I ordered the Kaizen roll...it was such a marriage in my mouth!!! Try it! Also their green tea ice fream doesnt taste powdery but creamy! Their portions are generous as well. The mister ordered sashimi 10 piece and he vouched the fish was fresh.  The place looks like it is more for the dinner crowd judging by the many speakers and projectors.  They got my vote for best non AYCE sushi in Vegas so far!",

    "text": "Yelp, you're fired. Four stars?! All I wanted was non-AYCE sushi, rated decently,  and near the strip. Jesus H. Christ! It's a fail when you come into a restaurant starving and you leave with everyone in your party invoking the Lord's name with his middle initial.*  Things started out okay with them seating us promptly. We drooled over the menu and ordered enough to feed every child in Botswana. It went downhill from there. The first piece of sushi, two pieces of uni, took almost an hour to get to our table. WE WERE WASTING VALUABLE GAMBLING TIME! Everyone at the craps table is depending on me to get back in the game.  The sushi man was a little stingy. It wasn't like I was ordering a 49 cent taco from Del Taco in South LA and then complaining to the cashier, and then to the manager that there wasn't enough meat in my sub-dollar taco, all the while getting approving \"um-huh\"s from my significant other standing behind me. You know? They could've been slightly more generous.   What's funny is I think they were Thai. Thai reminds me of Thailand. Thailand reminds me of my vacation to Phuket. In Phuket, we journeyed to a steakhouse that was highly, I mean HIGHLY, rated by Tripadvisor. So I thinks, maybe we's getting a good deal on expensive steak. My partner orders a ribeye, bone-in, because that's how us gangsters roll. The waitress retorts, \"Just to let you know, it's a little chewy.\" My partner responds, \"What do you mean?\" Waitress says, \"Are you Malay?\" My partner, looking confused, says, \"No.\" Waitress replies, \"Have you had a steak before?\" HAHAHA. Okay, screw you guys. It was funny at the time.  ANYWAYZ. You're better off going to some of the better AYCE in Vegas and not stuffing your face. You'll pay the same amount, or less, and get better quality sushi.  *In almost a decade spent in church, they never taught me what what Jesus's middle initial stood for, although the whispers say it may be Herbert, but it wasn't from me.",

I like the layout and how they compartmentalized the \"booths\". Food comes quick. Quality sushi so good i had to order same thing twice (snow white roll, YUM) cos my bf devoured the first plate even before he got his own (banana roll). One thing i really liked is that the rolls were tight so things aren't falling around the plate.  This place makes me think we've been to the wrong places! Lol",

Everything on the menu looked really good and sounded appetizing. Or it could've been that I was starving. We ordered a few plates. The seared salmon appetizer was way too salty. I had to tell them to take it back. And all the items on the menu was mainly tuna. Halfway eating I was starting to get sick of the smell and taste of tuna. This experience wasn't what I hoped for. If I'm ever in vegas, I probably wouldn't come back.",

    "text": "When it comes to food service and price point I would give Kaizen Fusion Roll five stars as far as customer services goes however they'll come in rolling at a 1 lowly star. So this review will average itself out at 3 stars.   Here's the situation. My friend and I went driving around looking for a place to eat at around 4a and yelped the nearest location. Boom Kaizen popped up near UNLV.   The food, for the price is awesome, I got a baked salmon roll. Delicious. Unlike all the other all you can eat places here and original. He got some type of calamari roll and something else.   Adding an $11 lychee flavored sake and a green tea tempura ice cream (but they don't serve vanilla flavor which didn't really make any sense to me but who am I...) who couldn't be more pleased?  Well... let's start from the beginning.   The serve here was beyond poor. Upon entrance the two girls that we were working had just the most unengaging attitudes and missed so many marks. I had to ask 3 times for the same 7UP, the miscommunication was so obviously there that the poor service just had to be mentioned.  I mean and I'm not to be a stickler about table courtesies, but all the servers that took our dishes away or served us just stuck their whole bodies right between both my friend and I - based on my memory as a server, aren't you supposed to come around the side or wouldn't that just make more sense? Anyway - it was an odd experience. Given I understand it's 5:30 in the morning at that point everyone wants to go home and they're shoving people out, but the place is still an establishment and the restaurant clearly strategically placed itself across certain hotel&casinos for a reason, but the place was dead on a Saturday night for obvious reasons...  I mean it's obviously not the food, the food is great and decently priced.  Worth it if it's LAST LAST minute late night dinner and you're near the UNLV campus.",

It seems like good ramen is easier to find in LA than good udon.  I had my fingers crossed when I ordered the udon at Kaizen but wasn't expecting too much. But my first taste had me closing my eyes in ecstasy.  I was in heaven.  I was incredibly starving at the time, so that might have swayed my opinion a little, but the broth was delicate and complex and oh-so-delicious. The noodles were the perfect texture.  The only downside is that the service wasn't good.  After waiting forever I had to flag someone down to take our order. Then they forgot our order of edamame. Food took a while to come out too.  But it's all worth it for the Udon!!! YUM!",

The sushi itself was a bit pricey; $8 for an order of salmon sushi. However, their cut rolls were the right price for the money. I had two full sized cut rolls for about 25. Not only was the price right, the chow was DAMN tasty. One roll had a house sauce made of a spicy mayo mix. YUM!!! The one down fall was the sake. I didn't notice a house sake and the cheapest bottle was $10. Now please keep in mind I'm only criticizing this because I'm on the work budget. $10 for a bottle of good sake is very reasonable. I definitely recommend this place for the location; right off the strip; the price, the menu and the quality of the chow. DO IT!!!!",

There best roll is hands down the \"sexy roll\" but ill let you be the judge cause there all good. The waitresses are nice and the place has a nice layout. Nice top 40 hits with a huge screen where they play the music video to whatever song is playing. Kinda cool to watch if you dont wanna chill at the bar and watch whatever sports game they have on.",

    "text": "The fiance and I were staying at a near by hotel so we decided to give this place a try.  We were really surprised at how fast our rolls were served. Aside from the fast service this was probably the worse sushi I ever had in Vegas. The rice in the rolls was a bit on the hard sticky side, and every time we picked a roll it immediately felled apart. The rolls were on the smaller side and did not justified the value of the higher prices. The fish didn't tasted very fresh, in fact there was a fishy after taste to it.   I came to the conclusion that the sushi we had was pre-made and had been sitting in a fridge for a while. My suspicion came from the very fast serving after ordering it, literally 3-4 minutes had gone by and we got our first and second roll. Our third roll came in at around the 7 minute mark. The third sushi roll was hot and it tasted like it had been microwaved, probably why the wait time was longer. My fiance and I had the Philadelphia roll, crunchy roll...nothing crunchy about this, and lasagna roll. I was greatly dissatisfied with the sushi and have no plans of ever coming back here again.",

She recommended that we come to Kaizen instead, strongly insisting that we could get the same quality sushi for a quarter of the price.  I was sure she was exaggerating, but figured that if her recommendation fell somewhere in between complete hyperbole and the truth it would still be a worthwhile risk.  This was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life, and Kaizen will be on my go to list whenever I'm in Vegas.  They have more \"riceless\" rolls than I have ever seen, each one more delicious than the next - this isn't the typical crab meat stuffed into a cucumber you'll get at most sushi restaurants.  The Scallop Volcano Roll integrated mushrooms in a manner I had never before seen at a sushi restaurant, and I'm not ashamed to add that I was drinking the mushroom broth afterwards like soup - it was simply amazing.  Is the quality better than Nobu?  Of course not.  Is the taste on par?  Yes, definitely.  Add in the 2 for 1 happy hour and this is the best combination of value and taste in Las Vegas.",

Their spicy crab hand roll ($5.50) looked something out of a scary anime movie. It was a crumpled up sheet of imitation crab soaked in a warm red mystery sauce sloppily stuffed into a sheet of nori. By the time it was handed to me it was soggy and clearly unappetizing. I've *never* seen a spicy crab hand roll look like this. I would even go as far as saying it was really gross. I dare say it tasted even worse than it looked - warm, chewy, and messy. Somewhere in Japan, this has got to be considered illegal sushi.  Our sushi chef's demeanor was deadpan and straight up unfriendly. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but we soon caught his drift and decided to leave after another order (a scallop sushi roll which was ugly as shit, and made without care).  Just when I thought we cut our losses and were off to another establishment to save our supper, I was given the \"Sorry, sir, our system is down, can you pay with cash?\" What complete crap. I should've called their bluff. It's been 5 years since I've encountered that in Vegas. Visa, Mastercard Inc., and the Better Business Bureau should be notified.  The industry folks love this place, and I don't understand it. Avoid at all costs.",

    "text": "We stopped by for dinner. Elegant atmosphere, modern, attentive service. We asked for the chef's recommendation and very quickly the roll Kiss of Fire appeared along with 10-piece sashimi. The roll has slices of jalapeno and a dab of hot sauce, and along with a vinegary sauce was full of flavor, without completely masking the flavor of the tuna, which had a fresh, buttery texture.   The sashimi tasted fresh, nice texture without any gristle and interesting sauces. Our favorite was yellowtail with a wasabi sauce.   Tempura green tea ice cream was perfect, firm ice cream with just the right thickness of batter.   Service was quick, friendly and polite. I think we are coming back tomorrow :)",

The day after I checked my bank account and noticed I was charged on BOTH cards. I called and I was told to wait few days and the charge on the first card would have disappeared. I waited... nothing changed. I wanted to talk with the manager, but apparently this guy is NEVER available. I called and went there in person several times with my bank statements printed out, none could solve the issue. Eventually spoke with the manager, who told me to send to his email copy of my bank accounts with the statement showing (like I have all this time to waste? Do they think Im making this whole deal up for 26$? What about giving me a free meal and PEACE OUT?). I did emailed him all documents...He NEVER answered back. Called again, he was not at the restaurant. I'm so pissed that I've wasted all this time and got robbed. It's just unfair. Be aware of how they treat their clients!",

It was within walking distance & after checking it out on Yelp and seeing some good reviews, we gave it a try. Very good sushi & the manager and wait staff were very nice & attentive. We both had sushi & edamame and I also had miso soup.  We were both full when we left & the bill was about $40, including my ice tea and my husband's beer. We would eat here again if we were in the area, but since we would never stay at Hard Rock Hotel again, that most likely won't happen. If you like sushi and are stuck at HRH, this place should be on your list.",

The atmosphere is awful, a trashy crowd lingers and don't forget the extremely loud and cheesy music, its uncomfortable for anyone wanting a dinner where you don't feel like you are in a college-esque nightclub. The hostess couldn't be any ruder either, saying we couldn't get our food at the bar, and then she changed her mind after we were seated at a table- its like we are at a sushi bar at a strip mall not the Queen of Englands quarters, no need for the snobbery. Anyways, the sushi chefs are awesome and very friendly, and any other day or time is great to grab a bite to eat here, they also have Saketinis that are soooo adorable and delicious.",

    "text": "Great sushi.  Terrible service. The restaurant is set up very nicely.  We were seated in an elevated area between two other tables.  We waited about 10 minutes before any employee came by.  We were ready for drinks and to order when a server came to a table next to us (only because a diner at the table hollered for her to stop by).  She almost walked away when one of our diners asked her to come to our table because we were ready to order.  She told us she wasn't our server and would have him come to our table. A couple minutes later, he arrived.  He suffered through taking our order.  He was writing it down, but we still had to repeat ourselves a couple times.  I had our drink order memorized at that point and slowly said it to him again.  Then we ordered about 7 different items.  We were really worried about getting the right items.   The food began to come to us, before we got our cocktails.  I chose to wait a couple minutes for my drink before I started eating.  We ordered quite a few items, but I only tried a couple.  The cucumber salad was fresh, crisp and delicious.  I thought the beef sashimi was delicious, but my friend thought it was bland.  I had the chicken teriyaki roll and substituted with soy paper.  I highly recommend it.  Inside the roll is piece of chicken teriyaki, crab, avocado, and cucumber and they are placed on teriyaki sauce.  It was delicious!  The best part was the serving of chicken teriyaki with broccoli, mushrooms, and onions next to the rolls.   4 cocktails and 7 dishes came out to about 90 dollars; not bad.  The funny thing was, when we wanted our bill, the gal who said she wasn't our server was able to bring us our check when we asked her to have our server do so.  Next time we're in Vegas and want sushi, we'll probably go here, but sit at the bar for more prompt service. On a funny side note... one of the nearby diners was Carrot Top.",

I also tried the Scallop Volcano- a california roll exploding with tons of cooked mushrooms, scallops and spicy yummy sauce.  There are a lot of unique rolls with chicken or other cooked foods inside.  Sit at the bar and talk to one of the cool Japanese sushi chefs.

This placed my left nut and joy sucked my right. so at the end of the day, I guess I left happy. lol I definitely don't recommend it and suggest for them to work on service and their sushi chef's or people pretending, really need to get training or start giving a shit.  two thumbs down. never again.",

While we were in Vegas for the long weekend, we had a late night (2am) craving for dinner and of course, almost nothing was still open except buffets and Kaizen sushi. Score one for the sushi joint. A taxi driver recommended the spot to me and I have to say he was on point.  Walking in, it's a small place. But the decor is warm and inviting, as are the staff. They were playing music videos and tables full of people appeared to be having a great time doing sake bombs.   Their menu is HUGE. It's almost near impossible to make a choice based on all the yummy pictures and descriptions. But I settled on the Japanese steak and veggies (yummy shiitake mushrooms) and my friend ordered the albacore and the beef tataki (sp?) The food was so delicious that even as we stuffed ourselves silly, we made sure to wrap up the leftovers and take them back to the room.   The price was affordable, service was quick, knowledgable and friendly, and they called us a cab to go back to the room. And did I mention they're open until 3am? Kudos. I'm definitely a fan and will return next time I'm in Sin City.",

We just need two tables. The lady said the available tables are reserved for reservations. I was like OK?!  There were six tables available and she kept insisting they are reserved for reservations. So I told the lady no worries we'll go somewhere else. She said OK bye. Which to me was funny because obviously she didn't care about customer service. We drove down a couple streets to I LOVE SUSHI.

    "text": "First Impressions: Clean place. Nice decor. Good atmosphere. They have a TV. It's a nice and quiet place, but there weren't many people there, so it might be different when it's packed.  About me: I'm Japanese. I love sushi. I go out to eat sushi once a month or so by myself. I was in Vegas just for the weekend.  Summary: I went at around 8:30 pm, and they were out of uni & toro. I ordered mainly nigiri sushi and not much stood out. I also got the chicken katsu, which wasn't bad but nothing special. Food: 3/5 - Average Service: 4/5 - Good Overall: 3/5  Review: I went at around 8:30pm on a Sunday night with a friend. I made a reservation twenty minutes beforehand, but the place was almost empty when we arrived. The first things I always order at a sushi bar are toro and uni. They were both out, but it was 8:30pm, so it was understandable.  I started out with albacore belly, mackerel, salmon, ikura, and tuna. I usually always order albacore belly, mackerel, and salmon as they're a few of my favorite sushi. The ones I had here weren't bad, but they didn't taste great either. I was here with a friend who doesn't eat sushi as often, so I ordered the tuna (something common) and ikura (slightly obscure) for him as well. The tuna and ikura tasted better than I expected, but my expectations were set a little low after eating their albacore belly, mackerel, and salmon. I may have ordered something else as well here, but I'm drawing a blank.  I didn't want the bill to get too large, so I ordered chicken katsu to share with my friend. The chicken katsu was a little thin, and they were cut into pieces the size of a pencil (in terms of thickness/width). This is personal preference, but I preferred the pieces to be a little fatter/wider.  I wanted to finish off the night with some more sushi, so I asked the sushi chef for a recommendation and ordered the madai. It was actually pretty good. Possibly the best sushi of the night. I ended up ordering another serving.  The bill came out to be ~$100 for the two of us, which is average for a sushi place (not too cheap, not too expensive). I paid $60 ($10 tip) for the meal.  During the meal, the waitress made sure I didn't run out of my tea (she asked if I would like more when I was low), so that was nice. She also asked us multiple times how our meal was going. So the service here was pretty good.  Conclusion: It's a decent sushi place, but it wasn't good enough to make it a go-to sushi bar every time I'm in Vegas. I think it's worth exploring other options.  Food: 3/5 - Average Atmosphere: 4/5 - Good Service: 4/5 - Good Overall: 3/5 (weighed on food score)  Other thoughts: I went to a sushi place in San Diego called Sushi Ota about a month prior to visiting Kaizen Sushi in Vegas. The sushi at Sushi Ota tasted incredible, so it raised the bar for my future sushi outings. I may have rated Kaizen Sushi higher if I hadn't visited Sushi Ota.",

Service is always top notch and although they don't offer AYCE, I still walk out very full for about $25.  The staff is really polite and always on top of their game, even when it's super busy and they are clearly understaffed.  The waiters and waitresses they have know the entire menu and restaurant very well + their regulars.  The best thing about this restaurant is the layout and seating options.  When I dine with friends where we will be talking a ton and want a more private area, the tables on the left offer a nice view of the restaurant without all of the noise and busyness.  When I come alone I either prefer the bar top or the long tables on the main floor area, depending on the mood I am in.    I love the music here and although it can seem a little bit loud sometimes when the restaurant is full and Lady Gaga is playing over the sound system to add to the noise, it somehow seems fitting to the energy of the servers here.    I really do wish Kaizen would start doing an AYCE menu at least during certain hours.  Their sushi is really fresh and if they offered AYCE, I would likely get more nigiri than rolls as their nigiri and hand rolls seem quite pricey for being so small.",

The rolls are all unique and the chefs make the sauces bring out the best flavor in the fish. The tangy and spicy mayo add delicious character to the already melt in your mouth sushi. You win Las Vegas thank you for this amazing place. King of the ocean, double yellowtail are both amazing!  So is their king crab miso soup, worth every penny!  The cucumber salad came with a sweet crab garnish and really complimented the basic yet fresh cucumber vinaigrette.",

Yes it is a TAD bit more expensive then other places, but the rolls that we purchased were delicious.   We had Spicy Tuna, Las Vegas, California, and Night roll.  The hot tea was one of the better ones I've tried as well.  Sushi is not overfilled with rice, the crab (if not imitation) in the California roll is not drenched in mayo.   The staff was friendly, and service was good.   It is also easy to order because their menu is loaded with pictures, so if you are not sure, feel free to order with your eyes.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall by the Hard Rock. The inside decor is really \"cool\" and what I guess I can describe as \"fusion\". On the outside you wouldn't really think anything of this place, but hey it's whats on the inside that counts. They even have a DJ playing some 90s music for that extra \"hip\" feel. It was more than welcomed.  For late late late night-- or early morning cravings of Sushi, check this place out.",

We were staying at the Hard Rock so we dedided to check out the strip mall across the street. Kaizen Sushi was closed at that time, and even though I couldn't see what the inside looked like, the sushi craving kicked in.  We came back later on and I am so glad we did. I ordered a couple of rolls, one being The Hungry Roll.. oh my god! it was enormous.. I would have been good with just that!!  We went back another time with a pretty large group of friends and they were very accomodating. I tried some of the baked rolls, which were delicious and not so heavy as my beloved tempura rolls. Eveyone else's food looked good, and no one had any complaints. I had the Lychee martini which was very tasty. We also got the party started with shots with ty ku.. sooo yummy! I wish they had it in L.A.  Overall, I love how it is nice yet very casual. Also, they have such a big selection of rolls!!!!  My only complaint (which wasn't the restaurants fault) is that we had them call a cab for us and we waited for about an hour and they never showed up. We walked over to the Hard Rock and the taxi line was huge. It was hot and it was annoying..... not the restaurants fault, but something to keep in mind!",

I have a new favorite, fo' sho'. A little slower than some places (as others have pointed out) but worth it, I think. They take their time to make sure it's executed perfectly. Service with a smile and we lacked for nothing.   The shitake mushroom roll was earthy and perfectly balanced with the crunch of veg and a touch of crispy tempura. Served with some tempura fungi on the side, and it's a complete dish!   The Rose and White Rose rolls have been entered into my foodporn um, brain bank... ;) No rice (perfect for me): it's amazing fish, sauce, and a touch of veg here and there... WRAPPED IN MORE FISH. #winwin  We also had a soft-shell crab roll (the name escapes me and it's not on the online menu) that was similar. More fish wrapped in fish. Really. #happyMuse  We had a few other rolls, including the Rock and Roll, the Firecracker, a crunchy scallop roll (served with additional panko-breaded scallops! Yum!), and an unagi/avocado roll. All very, very good. The sauces were not overly used - Bonus points! - just enough to go with the flavor profiles they were trying to create. No sauce-drowned fishies here!  To taste the fish on its own (as Bentern says in his review, without the \"tacky\" sauce), we did order some nigiri including salmon, tuna, and uni. The uni, my favorite but not that of my dining companions, was fresh, sweet, and perfect. Always a great sign of a great place, IMHO.  Again I have to point out that I like that they don't pack their rolls with rice (and have a LOT of non-rice options). The menu is *extensive* (the online menu is a fraction of the options you actually have). In addition to the sushi and sashimi, they offer some entrees as well.  I don't mind a lack of AYCE because I don't eat enough to make those \"deals\" worth it. However, I could see the draw in having something here... They can be on the pricey side. That said, Friday night we had a hell of a meal between the three of us... a ton of great food, a couple cucumber salads (meh... just a lot of cucumber in a martini glass... wasn't impressed), some soup, and all those rolls. For... 70ish bucks? Three people? Not bad at all for what you are getting.  And now I am hungry... Dinner, anyone?",

Our food came super quickly and everything was really fresh...shocking for 4am!   I had a cucumber salad that was served in a martini glass (super fun). The clam on top was SO fresh. I also had the crazy boy roll which was delicious as well.   Very reasonably priced. Our waiter even called two cabs for us after we were done.

Thought that they had very inventive rolls, but was disappointed in the complete lack of a lunch special (was there at 1 pm) as well as the service. The waitress was pleasant and helpful, but was the only one working the entire lunch rush and couldn't handle everything. I sat at the bar and waited a good deal of time between each roll, and had empty water glasses the entire time.  I think the service is probably perfectly fine when there are more employees there, and the rolls were certainly tasty. Slightly overpriced in my opinion, but tasty. I'd say this place is worth a try if you're headed to the airport and want somewhere that isn't flooded with tourists.",

The garlic edamame is the BOMB (olive oil, crushed garlic, a little shoyu stirr fried with FRESH crisp edamame --straight and to the point). All the waiters were super helpful and did not leave me unattended. Side note it doesn't hurt that there bathroom is even squeeze clean. Not an AYCE place (for all the fish lovers out there (:  )  but this is a place where the quality overshadowed quantity (but forreal i love AYCE with quality too haha) I will definitely make another trip again soon!",

    "text": "BOO. So disappointed.  Came here around 8 on a Saturday night after Yama's Sushi had a 30 minute wait. Soon as we came, we were seated immediately which was good because we had a party to go to at 10.  Each of my friends ordered a hot/cooked dish and a specialty roll; I ordered the chirashi (sashimi sampler on rice) because I didn't want to be too full for the night's festivities.  In 15 mins, my friends each got their cooked meal - seafood curry, chicken katsu, and chicken teriyaki donburi. Told my friends to eat as my food was surely to come out soon. I watched my friends eat as I drank water; and watched more and more people come into the restaurant.  Before I knew it, my friends were done with their meals. And I started noticing that the groups of people that came after us were getting their sushi. This was about 30 mins after ordering. We kept looking for our waitress for the next 5-10 minutes but, no one came into our section. We, finally, had to wave down the hostess to check on our sushi.  My friends' specialty rolls, finally, came. But, at that point, their food had already settled and they weren't hungry.  Finally...after an hour of waiting, my food came. By that time, I didn't even wanna eat it.  For a city that has all these AYCE and stellar sushi spots, Kaizen should be lucky to be open. And with service like this; forget it!",

As usual, everything was fantastic. Maybe a little less attentive than I'm used to Kama maybe could have improved on that but overall another great time at one of the best sushi restaurants in town   I've been to this place on three or four occasions. It never lets me down. From the sushi to the sushi me to the cut rolls, this place is top-notch. I also like how it's not so formal. It's a place where you can be somewhat formal or completely laid back and just enjoy some amazing sushi",

I sat down at the bar and waited at least 10mins before the sushi chef asked if anyone has even took care of me. I ordered my rolls with him, only for him to delivery the order to a staff member. Even then nobody asked if I needed anything to drink, then the sushi chef had to remind someone to help me. They took forever to clear my area of plates and took forever to give me the check and come to pick it up! I am very unhappy with the Customer service here.   But the pineapple saketini were great",

The majority of sushi spots in Vegas are AYCE- and I'm fine going to a place that isn't, but the expectation is that the quality is higher. And while the presentation and service were good, the actual quality of product and freshness of fish seemed average.  When ordering takeout, this spot is great about carefully packing up your order so each roll has it's accompanying sauces alongside- this allows you to control how much is used and prevents the rice from getting soggy on your ride home!   Menu features a wide range of specialty sushi rolls, and some grilled items and apps as well. Nigiri oddly did not seem to to be that common here. The Kai roll was recommended by staff and the best of what we tried.   NOTE: Takeout rolls noticeably smaller than what is received dining in.",

There wasn't a single Vegas trip that I didn't stop by Kaizen to have my favorite sushi. I've been to hundreds of sushi restaurants including LA's top rated and most expensive - no one can compete with the taste of food like at Kaizen. My favorite is a chicken teriyaki bowl and garlic edamame. My spouse loves the avocado train , Palm Springs, orange blossom rolls and pretty much everything else that's on the menu.  Top sushi restaurants with an amazing environment and music !!! I'm definitely signing my name under it.  Armen Way #dwtslv",

Went to bed around midnight stomach already started hurting before I slept and around 4am I woke up & started puking so much and I noticed the salmon was still recognizable... (I know our body won't digest food that are bad) felt like dying pretty much until noon... almost went to the hospital thinking I'm having ulcers/appendicitis.  Had 2 glasses of chamomile tea, about 3 tums, 3 glasses of milk, about 20 peppermints, 7 glasses of Gatorade today... Finally feeling better now... almost 24 hours later.  Never threw up so much in my life that my throat hurts.  And yeah diarrhea too... thank you to whoever ok'd to serve that salmon.  I hope karma gets you.",

This is one of the few sushi places I know of that have a Fried Banana Roll. At less than $10, the roll is ridiculously well priced and delicious. Which brings me to my next point - the prices.   The prices are extremely reasonable. They have their roll with all the bells and whistles at $13-$16 a roll, but with a plethora of well-topped rolls at or less than $10, it's a bargain. Quality is top notch, and this is coming from a guy who lives in LA.   Drop by here and grab yourself some sushi (did I mentioned they're open until 6am on Fridays and Saturdays?

A few minutes after we started eating I asked for paper napkins and as the server was bringing them to me one fell down on the floor. Surprisingly she picked it up and put it together with the other napkin she was bringing me... After giving me the clean and dirty napkin she took the dirty one with her saying it was dirty, and I honestly believe that if she knew we hadn't seen it she would have given me the dirty and the clean one.  That was the end for me, I could barely finish my meal as I was disgusted.  It's a nice restaurant with good food but they could use hygiene.",

Servers are not very friendly, personable or helpful, and $16 tip to pass a plate from the sushi bar to my table is not a good deal. Several reviews for this place compare it to other Vegas all-you-can-eat (AYCR) places. With that being said, I'm not going back here! You have to EARN your tip, not force it on me...this is the USA not a socialist country! Also, bathrooms suck, always waiting to pee, and music is lame...who is your music programer?",

Everything tasted fresh. The waiters are attentive but don't know if because there were only 3 guest here on a Sunday but none the less great staff. If u Check in on yelp and do a review u get a free something lol explains why there are so many reviews lol great place great food and great staff:)  If I could change just one thing it would be the can sodas, no refills. It didn't bother us mich but just maybe something we would of liked to know before ordering a soda.",

The atmosphere is great, the food is superb, the people are amazing. I can't think of a negative thing to say about Kaizen. Well, maybe that it's not in California???  It's not a touristy spot so it's not crowded. I've seriously been here at all times of the day and I've never had to wait to be seated. There is plenty of parking. I'm telling you, this place is so unassuming that I'm tempted to keep it my little secret. This place is so awesome though, that it deserves all the success and accolades.",

We sat at the bar and once our food was served there was a roach crawling on the counter that ventured into the food prep side. The guys who make the sushi saw this and made no attempt to find the roach. They went back into the kitchen and started laughing and came out after laughing and acted like nothing was wrong. We were so disgusted that we had to leave. Never going back again. Obviously food cleanliness is not a priority for this restaurant.",

    "text": "This place has a lot of potential, considering the fact that the location is pretty good.  The place attempts at an identity; dimly lit rooms, walls and menus decorated in sleek yet simple design.  Bold and different from other sushi venues in Las Vegas.  Overall, not bad.  Even the food is designed to look cute and all.  You may notice the sushi takes a little bit longer to prepare than other venues, and obviously it's because they're taking their time laying out and arranging the sushi to make it look nice.  Makes up for a nice Kodak moment if you're into that kind of stuff.  It's impressive, but the bottom line is that no amount of decoration can make a delicious meal.  The fact is, the sushi tastes bad. Really bad.  To be fair, the sushi may be OK for first timers or real causal sushi goers, but it just doesn't cut it for me.  The biggest reason is that the rice is terrible.  It doesn't mix well with the sashimi at all.  It's always because the rice is cooked too thin,there's too much rice in the roll, it's not packed correctly with the sashimi, the list goes on and on.  The fish is OK, but not mind-blowing.  The best way to find out if a sushi joint is good is to eat the most perishable fish on their menu.  I always try the Ebi(Shrimp), Ama-ebi(Sweet Shrimp), and Uni(Sea Urchin) as starters.  Try one of these as a Nigiri (Fish and Rice only, with no tacky sauce), and you'll know in a heartbeat if the fish is fresh or not.  It doesn't matter anyways because you shouldn't order Nigiri at a sushi joint that doesn't have AYCE unless you wanna put a hole in your wallet.  The price is pretty overpriced as well.  I know it's near the Strip and everything, but it seems that's all you're paying for at this point.  The food does no help to justify the price of the dishes.  Oh, I just want to point out it took nearly 20 minutes for them to prepare a California Roll.  Unbelievable.  I don't care if it looked pretty because when I'm hungry I can eat anything that looks close to edible.  The thought of waiting another 20 minutes was insane.   I can't imagine how much longer it will take if I ordered it during their peak hours.  If you go there around 10-11pm when they're busy, good luck ever getting your food..  In conclusion, considering that the food comes out looking pretty like a flower arrangement and takes a long time, its more like a lounge-like environment.  Go with a couple friends when you aren't too hungry, have a couple drinks and poke at the pretty food that takes forever to come out.  In that sense, it's an OK experience.  But as far as taste goes, stay awaaaay.   PRO: Nice decoration, location is OK.  Sushi may be decent for casuals CON: Sushi tastes bland, dishes takes a really long time to come out, no AYCE",

That probably contributed to why we kept ordering roll after roll... we arrived hungry, and the food emerged as each dish was ready, seemingly two beats after we'd spoken the words. Delicious spicy hamachi, tuna sashimi in garlic ponzu, rainbow roll, unagi, various maki of salmon persuasions, I could go on... The vegetarian among us was also pleased with her rolls. I was quite impressed with the freshness of the fish (a feat of modernity I've never gotten over since inhabiting landlocked states).    Even after several add-ons to our orders, sake for the table, and mango mochi, the total bill was still impressively moderate. Unless your heart is set on Nobu, give Kaizen a try. Just be careful of those speed-demons tearing across Paradise.",

I was getting extremely tired of eating american food (ie Cheese Fries and Chicken Strips) at Mr. Lucky's 24/7, me and my friend were totally craving for some rice. =) I was confused by the location on the google map because we exited from the back side of the Hard Rock rather than the front and couldn't see any street signs. After walking up and down Paradise Road we finally were able to find the location. It's really easy to find, just make sure you exit the Hard Rock from the front, walk over to the Hard Rock Cafe and walk across the street towards the CVS pharmacy. A few doors down is the Kaizen Fusion Roll and Sushi. =)   I loved that they were really trendy, with trendy decor (70's looking partitioners that split the tables) and they were playing popular upbeat music that got me back into the mood to party again (I was feeling tired from Rehab, I wasn't feeling up to going to Body English later in the night). =)  We got seated right away, the service the waitresses were giving was very attentive, and we got our food right away. =)  The food was DELICIOUS!!! =)  We shared a tempura roll and edamame (they hook up the edamame!) and the chicken teryiaki bowl. But it wasn't your trypical teryiaki bowl... it tasted stir fried so it definitely added more flavor to the entree! =)  Plus the meal ended up being like $20! Super cheap! =)  Even if I wasn't staying at the Hard Rock Hotel I would still come by here again for Sushi... another bonus to this place is that they are open late! I believe on the weekends they are open until 4 or 5am!  A MUST visit if you're craving for more than just american fried food and don't want to make the drive out of the Hard Rock.",

Since he's from the West Coast and I'm a Midwesterner, I decided I had to see about this for myself.  Not sure if it was the saki bomb or the sushi itself, but damn, it was good.  A little on the pricey side for what you get, hence the 1 star reduction.  I guess that's in comparison to the sushi prices I'm used to in places that aren't Vegas, so it's probably good for Vegas prices.  But I'll definitely be back if I ever find myself in Vegas again, as unlikely as that is.",

    "text": "Holy mackerel... I was not expecting this dining experience. Just arrived from LA to visit my grandparents for the holiday, got out of the care home way later than expected, hotel check-in was a mess, all the boyfriend and I felt like was sushi. It was 10:30 and everything was about to close at 11. We gave up on the \"epic Vegas dining experience\" and just picked the highest rated sushi joint on yelp that was open. Some place in a strip mall. (Eyebrow raised)  Just upon walking in, we were shocked to see and feel such a nice and trendy vibe. Clean, classy, good music, nice bar, neat tables. We sat at the bar and opened the fabulously photographed menus. Sushi spots with photos is a major plus for me and they had EVERYTHING photographed. We picked a bunch of stuff and were blown away with not only the taste/freshness/quality of fish, but the presentation, price/portions, service... Just everything. The bill ended up being $122 and trust me... we were really going for it. Anywhere else back in LA would have racked up to $200+.   We stayed and hung out well after we were stuffed to the brim. The ambiance is nice and I felt like I was getting a special type of Vegas experience without all the hustle and bustle. I will absolutely be showing this place off to friends who join me on future trips. What a treat!  Oh yeah... And it's open until 6am. AND they have a happy hour that starts at midnight. GENIUS!!!  I posted photos of what we ate - albacore topped with fried onions, filet mignon salad, white rose roll, sea bass & unagi. We also had saki bombs, the largest portion of edemami ever, uni and crispy tuna tostada things. YUM YUMMMMM YUM",

The restaurant had a nice ambiance with the white Christmas lights and the fringe curtains that separates the restaurant to different sections to create a cozy atmosphere. Servers are super attentive and you don't even have to flag them down to get a refill. We did family style and we shared our sushi rolls. They are very large and beautiful presented. The avocado train was picture perfect and tasted delicious with a big ball of crab wrapped with avocado! It was so beautiful! Their Ninja roll was a perfect combination of just a little spicy kick without being too spicy. Rainbow roll was just average. I would recommend that you order their specialty sushis and not your typical sushi rolls. You will be blown away!",

    "text": "Ended up coming here with a date to avoid the crazy New Years crowd on the strip! I was recommended to come here by one of the pit bosses while gambling. They had stated that this pale was open until 6 A.M. which was a major plus since It was past midnight at that point. Ended up getting to the restaurant around 1. We started off with a bottle of sake called \"nothingness\" which was pretty good. (Sweeter cold sake) The food was absolutely amazing, everything was fresh and delicious. The service was also very good! Since it was considered happy hour at that time they brought us an extra bottle of sake on the house. It was only a 5 minute cap ride from Planet Hollywood here which wasn't bad at all. I initially had doubts about this place number one because it was off the strip and number 2 because it was open so late, but I am glad I ended up coming here as oppose to anywhere else. The vibe was also very good. A nice place to take a date. For it being a sushi restaurant in Vegas the price was very reasonable, I was expecting it to be about doubled what I ended up paying! I will definitely come back here next time I am in town! I can easily say it is one of the top 5 sushi spots I have been too!",

I've been here about 5 times in the last 3 months and the last experience was the one that made up my mind to stop coming to this specific location.   In our seating area we were the first table to arrive and then a few other people arrived about 5 minutes later. We were immediately ready to order, but instead our waiter took their order instead...  [worst] thing a waiter could do.. in my book.  He came to our table 10 minutes later the came back with sushi that was completely drenched in sauce to the point where I could't eat it and the dish they served it on was so darn small  my food was spilling all over the place, so I asked for larger dish... weird...   The place wasn't packed and it took another 15 minutes to get a check and get out. Ugh... Despite the repeated poor service at this specific joint, I still recommend Kaizen, but at a different location.",

    "text": "I like Kaizen. It's hip, easy to go with a group of friends and they have some interesting rolls to choose from.  My only issue is that it's a bit pricey for me. Two rolls and a drink - your check is about $40 before gratuity. I'd rather go to an all you can eat sushi restaurant for half that price and pig out! But this place is open super late (4AM) which is a plus for us industry folks who crave sushi right after partying at the club. HEYYY!!!!",

    "text": "Take your time and enjoy the experience... Great sake choices too ;D  It's been a while since I had really great quality sushi; thanks to Mel!  All their rolls are done exquisitely and with great detail.  The menu does provide you ample choices so you should listen to your gut and instincts to choose what you should have.  All in all, the service is extremely attentive and prompt.  If you're not getting your food quick enough, it's most likely due to your indecisiveness in selecting what you want from the menu.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would make the effort to wander off the strip to eat here again.  If you're staying at the Hard Rock Casino, it's right across the street in the same complex with CVS.  Enjoy, eat sushi, and please drink some of their wonderful sake too.",

    "text": "Kaizen is a destination restaurant worth the flight to Vegas.  The sushi chefs are incredibly talented and come up with some really fresh combinations.  My favorite?  The Rose Roll!  Why?  Because it has no rice or seaweed, it's all fish wrapped in fish.  I have them add some jalapenos on top to give a bit of spice.  Amazing!  Fresh sashimi and nigiri, doesn't get better than this. Also the prices are super reasonable, we fed 9 people for less than $900 and this included drinks, food, sake etc.  Will go every time I'm in Vegas!",

It's located right across the street from the hard rock, so it won't take you more than 15 mins to get here if you're staying on the strip. If you are craving good sushi and don't feel like waiting hours in order to get it, just drive or take a can here. It will be worth it!",

    "text": "Seriously underwhelmed. I came here after seeing numerous good reviews for this place. Wow, all I can say is wow this place was terrible. For starters I think it's in bad taste when they add mandatory gratuity for service. I feel a tip should be based on the service provided, which was decent but not out of this world. The iced green tea tasted like fish water. Waitress tried to tell me they add some special leaves or whatever but fish is fish is fish and that tea tasted like fish!!! The short ribs were greasy and burnt. The other rolls were decent but nothing I would come back for. Matter of fact we were left so unsatisfied we're on our way to get tacos now after leaving this place!",
