We had a lot of good food for a low price.  This place is not far from the strip and this local would recommend it to people who have a car on the strip to try it.  This place is casual and good for families.  Around the corner is the bead shack where you can buy beads and take beading classes too if you want a non-Vegas activity for a day.",

    "text": "It's actually sort of painful to have to do this because I like the pizza here, it was pretty decent overall.  They have really good specials and pricing on everything but I recently ate here and got food poisoning :(  I usually order the pick up special, large pizza.  I ordered one a few days ago and everything was fine as usual except I woke up in the middle of the night with some of the worst stomach cramps I've ever had and proceeded to spend the next few hours in and out of the bathroom.  I don't have to go into detail, it was a mild case of food poisoning. I don't like to point fingers and throw the term \"food poisoning\" around lightly, however it had to have come from the pizza I ordered.  It was the only thing I had eaten that evening.  I remember someone pointing out to me a few months ago that they thought they saw this pizza place on an episode of \"Dirty Dining\" on one of the news channels. Sucks because this place was convenient and the pizza was good, but not good enough to suffer the consequences of contamination.",

All of the beverages are free refill....no matter how many refills you desire. Super friendly family run resturant. They run a early bird special before 3 pm. It's the same offerings but at $7.99....same size. So why would I want to pay $16.99 for the same dish at $7.99?  I do my shopping on Stephanie and time my arrival for 2:30. One of my favorites is Lasagna. Comes out in it's own oven dish....caution it's hot. If i had any brains i would cut it in half when it comes out and have a second meal. I'm a hardy eater but i really have to open my belt a notch or two to finish it. The pizza is as close to New York as any in Vegas. $7.99..why would anyone go to a chain pizza store  to get industrial pizza. The called in pizza orders are a sight to see. Especially on the weekends. One car after another....some taking out 3, 5 and even 8.  Btw the $7.99 early bird dish include everything on the menu.",

Apparently the app is broken and she said i had to leave a yelp comment and show her the comment for the free. Well i called back to let her know it was done and inform her that my review was up and screen shotted my coupon. She said i couldnt have my boss pick up the order cause she needs my phone to be there. So i couldnt use it. I said to cancel the garlic balls because she was just asking me to do way too much for what's advertised and that we would be there to pick up the rest of the order... and i just called back to change my order to from pick up to delivery and found out that my ENTIRE order was cancelled, more or less because I said they are being ridiculous for making me jump through hurdles due to their app being malfunctioned.  Thats not customer service.  I hope the manager is on duty,  because I definetely need to discuss this with someone other than the one who takes the orders.",

They offer pretty decent New York-style pizza, and delivered in a reasonable amount of time (about 60 minutes - that's not bad for quality pizza on a Friday night).   My favorite Vegas pizza place for New York-style pizza is the often-crowded Secret Pizza at the Copsmpolitan, but this could definitely be a close second. My friends loved the Caesar Salad too. We'll definitely keep them in mind for next time.",

    "text": "OK, I've been ordering regularly from Napoli for a few years now, and it's about time everyone knew about this place.   Starting with the pizza...quite good, not great. Maybe a 7 out of 10, but well worth the carryout special price of $7.99 for a large 1-topping. Fed 3 generations with 3 of them last night for just a shade over $25.  So why should you go here? Allow me to continue...  I work in a local hospital. We have a pizzeria a block away, and we order lunch from this place, about 1.5 miles away. They have a ton of lunch specials at $7.99 (M-F 9am-3pm) that blow away anyone else's alleged specials. In particular: a hot pastrami and cheese hoagie with lots of both and dee-licious! And did I mention a ton of fries and a drink as well? Don't want a sandwich? They have 7 different HUGE salads in their specials. My favorite is the blackened chicken. I like the vinaigrette dressing with it.  Now, for the best part...the WINGS! I'm from the east coast and am very particular about my chicken wings. My opinion: this is the only place in town that gets it right! Huge wings, not those little pigeon wings most places serve. My choice is the hot, and they're perfect! Best combo of fire and flavor I've had since coming out west. We split a half-bucket (20 wings), add fries for a buck, and it comes to $14.99! Best wing deal in town! Look, you wanna split a pitcher and watch 6 games at once in a crowded bar, by all means go to BW3. You want wings, you get them here!  Small place, limited seating (at least at the Sahara/Decatur store), pretty much like a classic small family operation. And a correction to a previous review: they're not Russian, they're from Moldova.  To sum up: GO, GO, GO!!!",

Once, the pizza comes undercooked (which is awesome for leftovers) but a bit of a pain if you have to bake it further when your delivery arrives); the next time, it comes just under overcooked. Just. Almost perfect that day, but a little dried out as leftovers.   The quality of the pizza has been good every time. Can't complain about that. Just the lack of consistency in prep. The quality of other things... meh. But that's why pizza is the most delivered food in the US. It travels well.   Speaking of traveling, the delivery is excellent. Could be because I add the tip ahead of time and it's always 20 percent or at least $10. I don't think it's too much to compensate for my laziness for not going to pick it up myself. And I want to make sure the driver is paid well. Would you want to deliver food for a living? I know I wouldn't.   Napoli, work on your consistency and on the quality of your Philly cheese steak sandwiches and we'll likely be customers for life. Good pizza at the end of it all. I'll up your stars if I can get three pizzas in a row cooked consistently. ;-)",

I'm not a fan of hot wings so I get garlic parm and lemon pepper. I love that they come in a white sauce instead of oil (eek).  Napoli also has great fries. I hate to order fries to go because by the time I get home it usually get's soggy. Napoli fries surprisingly did not! It's made with some sort of coting which makes it pretty yum. My friend things it's fried in flour and I think it's fried in the same oil as curly fries (YES THEY GOT CURLY FRIES!) and the residue from the curly fries sticks to regular. Either way, the fries is pretty good.  I am personally not a fan of their pizza, I find it to be soggy and flavorless. I may give it another try at some point but for now, I will stick to the wings. They are DAMN good! This location gets pretty busy. If you are ordering to go and they tell you 30-40 min, it'll probably mean 1 hour. You can give your phone number and they will call you when it's ready. Ordering out while you're starving on a busy night may prove aggravating so don't fret, eat a snickers while you wait :)",

    "text": "This place has such mixed reviews.  They seem to have some consistency and customer service issues.  My experience was pretty indicative of that.  We walked in late afternoon on a Friday.  They weren't too busy.  Staff was very friendly and welcoming.  The girl who took our order was nice.  Told her about my allergies and ordered a tuna avocado sandwich on wheat bread (pending there were no nuts or seeds in it) with a side salad. Subbed out the chicken on our Delux pizza for jalapenos instead.  She checked with the kitchen about the wheat bread and said it had oats. I said oats are fine so we will get the wheat bread.  Side salad came out first.  It was fresh and the house vinaigrette is delicious. After that is when the problems started.  Sandwich came out next.  On a WHITE roll. The guy who brought it out offered to take it back but no biggie, we will eat it as is.   Pizza was delivered to the table. Covered in chicken. NO jalapenos. Sigh. Am I taking crazy pills? Was she just pretending to write down our order the whole time?   Overall, the food was fresh and delicious so I can't really complain there. The young lady who messed up our order never came back to the table, but the guy who served us the rest of the time was super attentive. Based on my experience and after reading some of these negative reviews, I think they just need to train their staff a little better.",

Usually I don't say anything but I am more disappointed because everything else was so good I got the Napoli Burger with Swiss cheese and it was amazing I could not put it down. The Napoli pastrami... omg! Their fries are excellent as is their shrimp salad, so I guess I'm wondering why you would serve pre-made Frozen tasteless appetizers when everything else is so delicious.",

I called in an order and made sure to say I needed it as fast as possible, assuming it would be 45 minutes for a pizza and a salad, it's been an hour and a half, when I called in the guy on the phone said I told you on the phone it would take an hour, yet the driver hadn't even left the building yet and he hung up on me. At this point I don't even care if the food is the best food I've ever had, I'll never buy food here again and I'll make sure none of my family here does as well. They don't deserve business if they can't handle the customer service side of it.  So it's now been 2 hours that I've been waiting for my food, I called in and asked how much longer it would be and the guy said 10 minutes, this was 30 minutes ago.  Edit-- Adding in that the food was ALL cold, the pizza cheese was almost frozen, the curly fries were soggy as well as the salad. And to top it off they forgot my sons breadsticks which I clearly said twice and he confirmed on the phone and repeated back breadsticks to me.  Food ordered at 11:14pm Food arrived at 1:37pm  Fast delivery is written on the box as well, False advertising much?",

We saw several 30' pizzas and were just amazed, everything looked great , we saw the chicken wings and it was towering on the plate. We had the all meat deep dish pizza and the garlic balls. The pizza was a little greasy but I don't care, it's pizza!! It was very tasty and some toppings were spicy but that's what we love. The garlic balls were quite good and I highly recommend them, they were piping hot which was great, they were delicious!  Service was good but she did disappear for a little while since they were getting busy.  I would recommend going to this place especially with big parties and getting the 30'er.  Don't insult the leftovers by microwaving them, 375 degrees for 10 minutes and you can relive the taste of good pizza a second night.  Definitely one of my go to placers next time we visit.",

Even medium was a little too spicy for me but the wings are addicting. Also the wings have the options of coming with fries..get them, they are incredible! They aren't average fries. They are seasoned, super crunchy, and always come out hot!  Strongly recommend eating here. The inside is clean, modern, and a great environment with friendly staff.",

As my son I were finished eating the pizza I noticed a black small wavy hair melted into the cheese on the top of his pizza! At that point my stomach turned and I called the place. This less than sympathetic woman and I basically give her the run down. After being on hold twice she then asks me can they make me another pizza.

Last week they forgot to give us ranch with the wings, the lady on the phone said it was there and accused us of being incorrect. Today we ordered 2 pizzas, 2 orders of fries, and half a bucket of wings. We got home and opened everything and noticed they forgot to add our wings. My wife called and they said no that our wings were in the bag. Back and forth they adamantly kept saying they gave it to us, we never ever complain even if the order is wrong by a little. We drove back and the lady at the counter basically threw the half bucket of wings at us and never bothered to apologize for the incorrect order. Needless to say, this will be the last time we ever order from there and I will never recommend this place to anyone!",

What we ended up having was such terrible experience that we had to share it with everyone at work the very next day. After looking through  their very large menu my wife decided to order a  bacon-cheeseburger and I chose a pastrami sandwhich.The waitress took our order fairly quickly and she was polite, but then we waited and waited and waited. We see there are other customers who had arrived after us yet they were receiving their pizzas, wings and what looked like stromboli's or stufed pizzas. We kept looking at and signaling towards a large bald man that looked like the manager/ owner , we did the same signaling to the two girls who were on pc's and on the phone apparently taking phone orders. They would talk to each other, point towards us and they seemed to be asking each other what was going on. We waited over 35 minutes for a burger and a sandwich  and yet no one ever came to ask us anything and no one came to tell us how much longer it would be before we would get our order. Finally we decided to walk out and find something else to eat, shockingly we passed in front of over 5 employees including what looked like the owner or manager and no one even spoke  a word to us or ask us why we were leaving.This was a horrible experience and we will never visit again.",

I've never seen worse customer service before, not a single apology from anyone. At least PRETEND you care about customer experiences. It's really unfortunate because we are on this side of town all the time, but we will NEVER go back here.",

Made the mistake in ordering calamari for friends (they're calamari sticks btw) and I ordered myself curry fries with cheese. First off, cheese curly fries came with bacon which was not mentioned on the online menu or on the phone. Curly fries were also cold and soggy. The cheese on top was hard. Either way had to throw away because I don't eat meat, they need to clarify this on their menu.  Calamari sticks were also cold and soggy, had to throw away too. I've ordered from here quite a few times, since I do love their pizza. The lady on the phone always sounds angry, irritated, and desperate to get off the phone. Also, bec of her accent, it's very hard to understand her. Not the best service here.",

They usually deliver right around one hour after I order, which is totally reasonable, and the price is pretty decent for the quality.  I appreciate the little extra attention to details. They always include a baggie with paper plates, red pepper, parm, and napkins. Not really necessary, but nice.  My only gripe, and it's a minor one, is that the pizza isn't as hot as I would like. Not cold, but not hot. Of course, this is probably because I live so far away. :P",

To avoid any issues, we pre-ordered with the manager, 2 days in advance, 2 heart shaped pizzas for my daughter's class valentine's day party. 1 heart shaped giant cheese pizza and heart shaped large half pepperoni half bacon pizza. We agreed on a pick up time 11:15 so there would be ample time to make our 11:45 delivery deadline-20 hungry kids. we arrived to Napoli at 11:16 bc of torrential rain. They had not even started making our pizzas. Then we were told it would be 10 minutes. 15 minutes later, pizzas were boxed up and we raced out to get to school. We were late. We opened the boxes to find 1 heart shaped large-not giant-cheese pizza and next box we opened to find 1 large cheese pizza-zero pepperoni and zero bacon on the pizza. When we spoke to the manager about it she insisted she gave us the right order. THE only thing Napoli pizza delivered today, was a GIANT disappointment to my daughter and her class. Horrible experience. Despicable management. Shameful.",

The salads were ok, but only having one, and limpy, cucumber slice was sad. The spaghetti was bleh, but the raviolis were pretty good. We have far too many choices to risk another experience like this. Will not patronize again.",

Ridiculous right?  I looked at their menu and saw there was only a $1 difference so I instead asked for a $1 refund, the difference between what I paid for and what I received. This is what they said: they offered to send a drive to my house to pick up the wrong order, and then they would refund me $1. That's right, they would take the food back and instead of offering me a full refund on the wings, they offered me $1.   What a joke, I swear. Never again. Theft, place and simple.",

I had to meet him at my gate which isn't close to my house at all. When I finally received my food it was cold and tasteless. The zeppoles aren't even zeppoles, they were like pancake balls that were set to the side too long. They were extremely chewy and stale! The curly fries weren't even curly anymore, seriously cold and soggy. I don't even want to describe my pizza, the majority of people know once a pizza gets cold the cheese is disgusting and it's like eating a piece of cardboard.  When I asked for a refund the manager refused and said they delivered on time. The customer service was horrible and I even spoke to the manager and general manager Aleks and Victor and they were both bad at their jobs. Victor even told me that \"if the food is edible then I should just keep it.\"  Never again will I order from here or any of my friends and family.  This review was completely honest and will be posted on every site just so everyone can know, with the prices it's definitely not worth it.   I do recommend Verrazano's, great pizza nice and thin with a great amount of cheese! I also recommend not ordering from Eat24 as well because their customer service is horrible.. they always choose the restaraunt sides. Don't waste your time. Use Postmates, Grubhub or any other delivery app besides Eat24.   Thank you!",

Not a problem I did just that. My order has come I paid the extra plus a extremely generous tip and no jalapenos and the chili cheese fries taste like gas station chili cheese fries",

I had to call back and spoke to a man that told yes I did get some else order and he would send me another order.  Of course this would take time, and he wanted to pick up the food I had opened up.  I asked for a refund an no more food.  I ordered soup and chicken wings, and fries.  The food that arrived was not good, sitting in a pool of sauce. I can't speak for their pizza as I have not tried it. I was informed my refund could take 7-10 days. This was my 1st encounter with this restaurant and will be my last.",

They always forget the ketchup mustard and mayo despite the fact I call every time and type it on the online order form. The burger comes with fries, the fries are different every time.  I'm a salad person and their salads are fresh, huge, and full of quality ingredients!  The double bacon cheeseburger and the large house salad along with an appetizer, has become my usual Saturday night after work treat. It's honestly so much food It's enough to keep me away from the grocery store on my 3 day weekends!   I gave them 4 stars because they always forget the condiments, every time I call their staff is rude ( that's why I order online) they cross contaminate their fryer! The fries always taste fishy and they serve fried calamari. As a general rule, they should have 2 fryers, one for fish and meat, one for veggies and cheese. I work on the strip at a high end resteraunt, that being said I tip 15% on delivery and the delivery guy has an attitude every time. But the hours they are open are convenient and the salads and bacon cheeseburger can't be beat at 2:00 AM",

Besides the little buttery heart-stoppers, I've enjoyed their chicken fingers. Honestly, nothing special, just your average bar quality, frozen to fryer chicken fingers, but again, sometimes we just need that in our lives. They do have a pretty hefty selection of sauces which is great. It's nice to mix it up.  I'll probably eat here again, they deliver but don't order if you're already hungry. You'll eat the couch before they arrive. Maybe it was just a busy day, I'll update my review if it's faster next time.",

The meat has no flavor at all and  the other cheese looks like it was melted on top then left out to dry up which is probably what happened since we waited 45 minutes for this disgusting burger. My fries were all soggy limp and full of grease. I tried to save them with ketchup only to realize there wasnt even any salt put on them! Ice heard good things about this place so im double disappointed.   Also just to order one family size pizza with a topping other than just cheese... Look into spending about $30. Ridiculous for a pizza. And the cashier lady was rude and like rushed for me to order and it wasn't even busy.  I feel like for prices as high as theirs is, the ambiance should be better, the service definitely needs training on customer service and the food needs flavor and a definite quality boost. If my experience was this bad and it wasnt even busy... I hate to see them during a dinner rush.",

VERY inconsistent! Pizza is undercooked and sloppy and tatses like they use unfiltered tap water! Our pasta was overcooked! And swimming in water!! Gross!! And the fried mushrooms used to be good! Now they're mush! We spent over $40! And got crap food and service! They said they could only give us a $4 credit!?!? Are u guys serious??! Sadly, you guys lost me as a customer.

Co-workers and I order here all the time because the pizza is great and they have a 30\" pizza that is big enough for all of us. This time it was just two of use and we ordered a 16\" meat lovers. We placed the order for delivery as usual. They quoted us 40mins - 1hr. As a former restaurant manager I know only take 20-25 mins to make a pizza from start to finish. We didn't receive the pizza for 90mins (problem #1). We were anxious to dig in and enjoy what we have come to love. Yet the pizza was cold. Not like lukewarm cold, like the cheese is solid cold. (Problem #2). As we were eating my co-work bit into this hard piece of something (no it was not cartilage) it was an odd piece of plastic, maybe a utensil broke or something idk. (Problem #3) we called to inform them and this rude lady responded as \"well if you want a refund or a credit we need to pick up the pizza\" when the driver drive back to get the pizza he was just as puzzled as we were but what was really odd was that he needed to call the manager (the rude lady) to tell her how many slices were left in order to process the refund?? Gurl plz I ain't lying. You eat that pizza and tell me if there was anything else. Then when your done with it, hope on back to the kitchen and send me a fresh one like you should have in the first place.... I'll think twice about recommending the place to my guest again. Btw I work for a hotel so I have many people that ask for pizza.",

Ordering weekly at work and I also use it for big occasions spending over $200 at a time for parties. I ordered lunch last Friday for coworkers and the pizza came in a bent box. I opened the box and it had slid and was all crushed on the side and cheese was stuck to the top. For spending over $50 you want a perfect pizza. I called and told them. Their response, we can come pick it up and re make it. Ummmmm that would take over an hour. People will be going home at that point. They asked well what would you like us to do. A refund would  be nice. I've never complained. I am a loyal customer with a history. Their response, unless we see the pizza we don't believe you. Well. You just lost this loyal customer and hundreds of employees at a major local hospital I work at.",

The garlic bread was chewy and barely had any garlic flavor.

They used to cater at my college events. I mean c'mon they are known for their 30\" pizza! More than enough to go around and reasonably priced.  You can dine in, order take out or have it delivered. It's not a huge establishment but it's spacious and always clean. They are always courteous and they provide great customer service. They have a wide selection and they have a GLUTEN FREE menu as well. When you order delivery they are exact with the time! It's great that they don't take as long as other places. The owners/workers actually care!  You must try their bone in wings! I'm not sure how they do it, but they are delicious! Right amount of sauce, spicy but not too spicy, just right. Let's not forget about their garlic balls, mmm.. which you can get for free if you check in!  They have a carry out special, a one topping 16 inch for 8.99, it's actually cheaper than getting a small. It's available at all three locations.  The location is very convenient, it's in a small shopping plaza. If you're out and about near this area and you're hungry.. definitely stop in for a bite!",

We've ordered here twice and the first time it arrived hot, fresh and delicious but the crust was a little too thin. The next time I ordered I let them know to make the crust a bit thicker and crispier and they did just that. Their customer service is also top-notch even for deliveries. I have yet to experience their customer service and pizza inside the restaurant, but it's definitely on my list of things to do!   Pros:  Fresh Hand-Tossed Gluten Free Pizza Custom Toppings  Great Price",

After what I delt with when I called to complain this morning I doubt whom ever reads it will care so I am sharing it with ya'all as a head's up.  To whom it may concern:  We ordered a pizza, BLT and a side of fries and had it delivered to our room at the Rio last night at 9:30 PM.  Let me start with the ordering process... After repeating myself over and over again to the not so pleasant women on the other end of the phone whom was have just as hard of a time understanding me as I was her I finally got our order in. (This process was enough to make me not want to order from here again.)  At 10:50 PM our order finally arrived. Your driver was polite to my surprise after what I delt with on the phone. I was however very uncomfortable with the fact that he made an imprint of my card and took it with him...  Awww finally now we get to eat...  Nope!! The pizza was burnt and tasted aweful the BLT was lettuce and A LOT of mayo with a little piece of tomato and a pice of burnt bacon. Now on to the fries completely soggy and they tast like pickles because for some reason someone thought putting pickles ontop of the fies was a good idea.  I spent $50 on a meal my family and I couldn't even eat.  After getting into it with your manager just now  whom evidently is also the same women I talked to last night. It is clear to me that you don't care about your customers and you go by the manager is always right because she has to come in and work at 9AM after working until 1 AM the night before motto.",

But when you get home there's no meatballs in your sausage sandwich and French fries are soggy, somethings wrong!!!!.  I once again took everything home didn't check it there because they had everything <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fready.so&s=f8a6c4ac624f77618036bed5bdef26110aa55ec3e714187bb5a21678da7fc0a6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ready.so</a> I took it all the way back. They did a good job as you can tell in the other photo. The only complaint is wanna say is, the bread was still partially hard and partially soggy. I vented the box on the way home as the cook suggested so it wouldnt get soggy but it still did. The taste of the food was okay, truthfully not worth the $8.99.  The desserts were the best over all. I won't be back though!!! Whoever goes good luck",

I called this place based on a suggestion of a very good friend of mine who said that they had great food. Unfortunately they were unable able to cater to my allergy so I had to order pizza elsewhere. I did order garlic balls and three Italian sodas. I called and put in my order to this location first prior to putting my pizza order in somewhere else.   I was told that our order will arrive in 45 minutes to an hour. After an hour had passed I called back and spoke to the same woman I put my initial order with and she told me that it was not an hour yet it had only been 50 minutes, plus she argued with me!! I checked the phone and the call time on my cell phone and it had been an hour. She said that the driver had just left and would be here in a few minutes. When I told her that the pizza had arrived long before their driver had she told me that they were three times busier than everyone else and that was why. Why would you ever tell a client that?   I got off the phone we waited ten more minutes the driver had still not arrived , so I called them again and asked for a manager. The manager, named Bob came on the phone I explained the situation very nicely without getting angry or loud and was trying to find out where are sodas and are garlic balls were because we had already received our pizza from the place we called after them. So the manager fight with me and argue with me and what time it was I told him that the time was 11:15 and had already been well over an hour since we ordered he insisted that the time was only 11:04 and it was only an hour since we put in our order. No I called your person an hour ago and talked to them and told them that the driver had not arrived yet. He told me that I was yelling at him, so I put him on speakerphone so my friends could hear the way that he spoke to me. You've got to be kidding me that you speak to clients like that. When I told him that their place had been suggested by a very good friend of mine he said he really didn't care. I asked him to cancel my order three times before he said he would and he said he would refund my money in 24 to 48 hours. He told me that he would cancel the driver.  I think the best part of the night was when 10 minutes after I got off the phone with the manager his staff member called me and asked me what flavor I wanted for the wings. When I sounded confused and said we actually just cancelled our order with you and I spoke to the manager she said oh so you actually have the same telephone number that's similar to the person that I was trying to reach. I don't think so lady I doubt that there are that many people in Vegas calling from an 805 number.   Do not order from this place! Buyers Beware!",

When I called and asked for a credit they gave me two options. 1/2 half credit for the part that was incorrect or pick up the pizza and replace it in 30+ minutes. I asked for the manager and he was verbally abusive.  Did not acknowledge their mistake or the fact that they jeopardized my health with bad product.   15 minutes later the driver appeared to pick up the pizza saying they would replace it but I'd still be charged for the pizza.  Unbelievable.   The other pizzas were wet and soggy. Extremely poor service and lousy product. Avoid this place.   I called my credit card company and disputed the charges. I'm not paying for crappy food and abusive staff.",

They've also got a great response time for delivery. However, that's where the love portion dies.  Working across the street at a busy call center means that any day of the weeks has four or five people ordering. They've got this giant pizza that is popular with pot lucks. However, I can say I've never seen a greasier pizza in my entire life. Bring a roll of paper towels so you can get it all off. Same goes with the Calzones.  Their delivery guys are also super rude. I got some food from them the other day and I wanted to smack the dude who delivered. Asked me to sign the receipt and when I asked if he had a pen, all he said was, \"No,\" and then gave me a look full of sullen attitude. They're always like that.

But more than once I've been let down by the lack of communication between staff, and inattention to me, the customer.    Tonight I was flying solo, and sat at the counter. I figured that would be a high-visibility location, but I guessed wrong. Took me 20 minutes to get my soda (after paying while ordering). The soda and pizza came at same time, and that was the only time I saw a server before asking for a box, which I had to flag someone to get. I felt like they were deliberately avoiding me which doesn't make for a great dining experience.  Get it to go, you'll be thankful.",

The service is awful, there are like 4 waitress and waiters doing pretty much nothing, they don't ask you if you need anything else, even when they see that you run out of drinks and all the cups are empty, they didn't even tell us to \"Enjoy the Pizza\" or anything like that... Tbh worst pizza place ever",

The location is so convenient, I never have an issue with parking.  The atmosphere is so beautiful.  They are always so very courteous and welcoming. (Did I mention that already) ;)  I absolutely love the chicken Caesar salad so YUMMY!  We've ordered pizzas, chicken wings, deserts and about everything in the menu. I have not been disappointed at all and doubt I will ever be.   I will never order or eat pizza, chicken Caesar salad or chicken wings from anywhere else but Napolis. (My Fav!) Caution: when you order spicy chicken wings, you better be sure about that...lol (So yummy!)    They provide fast response on all orders and delivery is always quick and courteous.   I absolutely stand 100% by them and recommend them to everyone in Las Vegas.  Thanks Napolis Pizzeria for providing the best!",

I checked in on yelp and boy did they offer free garlic balls! Between the three of us it was around ~$50 : shrimp Alfredo, chicken wings with fries, a cheese burger with fries, ice tea and red wine. A friendly upsell with dessert was turned down with us not even finishing our orders. Nice place to watch soccer or whatever sports channel youre into. Also the dancy music in the background makes the atmosphere very lively even though it was dead with us being the only guests during the end of our lunch meal.",

I always order delivery I would say an hour is the average time it gets delivered. The wings here are so big and have so much meat! I always get hot,but he warned hot is reallly hot which is prefect for me. The ranch they make in house is pretty good too. So I came into eat  with a big group of friends and we ordered the 24 inch pizza with pepperoni and 40 wings with hot,mild,Hawaiian, and garlic Parmesan. All of the wings were pretty good I wasn't a big fan of the Hawaiian and the garlic Parmesan are super creamy. We came we conquered and we destroyed! I tell everybody about this place! I will continue to do so!",

I can eat ALOT but was so full ...I ate half the spinach salad which was so so good & 2 1/2 pieces of the pizza! I ordered the 4 topping & added extra olives & green peppers. From other pizza  places I can easily eat 1/2 a pizza. The 16\" would definitely be enough for 3-4 of me  so tasty I highly recommend this place!!!!!",

Curly cheese fries with bacon- this is actually something that earned them a star. It was good, very obvious that it was refrigerated fries but it was still good. I give this a 4/5!  3. Garlic bread(free with a check in)- taste like absolute garbage. Thank god it was free.   All in all, it is an okay restaurant if you're stopping in for food while shopping around.

Well the good folks said ma'am on your 47 dollar order because you did not call us back and complain even more last night; today the best we can do is credit you four whole dollars to your next order.

    "text": "I've ordered from Napoli several times when I didn't really feel like going out because it's super close to me. I've only ever ordered the gyro combo, so I can't comment on the other food.   The gyro is pretty tasty, but I wish it had more meat. (That's what she said.)  My biggest complaint is how long it takes to deliver the food. They routinely take 45+ mins. One time I ordered and it took so long that I forgot I placed an order until the driver showed up an hour and a half later with a little bit of an attitude.  Other than that, not a bad place. Definitely room for improvement though.",

    "text": "My wife and decided to try this place because it was close and we had been bombarded with their Togo menus.  It was raining as we walked in.  We ordered a supreme pizza, a coke, zepolli, and fried ravioli Togo.  We ate our ravioli in the restaurant while we waited on our pizza and the storm to finish. The employees continually yelled back at the kitchen wondering where our order was. Several times we were told it would be out on just a minute. One time we heard the guy in back say we had to put another one in. After an hour, our pizza finally came out.  I asked if it was normal to take so long ( mainly because we watched them take delivery orders on the phone, people who came ordered and left with their pizza, and still other patrons who came Sat down, had appetizers and pizza and still finished before we received our order). The lady behind the counter answered me saying that with the rain, they just get busy.  I just love being lied to and pushed away.  I love people who cannot be accountable, especially when those people are business owners.  At the very least, an apology for the wait may have been appropriate, alas we received nothing but a \"we are busy\".  Well our pizza was not very good... It was edible but we have had much better in this city for the price.  The zepolli were cold because they made them before the hour long pizza.  Zepolli do not reheat well.   If this is normal and according to the ratings and reviews on facebook, it is, we won't be back...",

The crust is probably the highlight for me, with a good amount of chewiness and not at all burnt or limp.  The pizza I *may* order again, but nothing else.  No matter how desperate your craving, do not order the \"Childrens Macaroni & Cheese.\"  The portion size was good, but it was dry and some noodles still crunchy.  Cheese not quality.  Also stay away from the dessert... the \"strawberry shortcake\" was really a slice of cake, which looked and felt like it had been left out for a week.  Spongy and disgusting.  The same goes for the zeppolis which were hard and seemed old.",

    "text": "I've been living in Las Vegas for a little over three years, but am originally from NYC (born and bred). I had tried to find pizza that I liked out here and had no luck. Dominos, Pizza Hut, etc. are what they are, but it isn't \"real\" pizza. The independent pizzerias in my neighborhood are crap too; I had given up on finding the perfect pie and began focusing on all the other good food out here (In-n-Out, anyone?) that I couldn't get back East.   One day a coworker bought lunch for the office. Lo and behold, the perfect sausage (real, Italian sausage in slices, not that crumbled garbage) and mushroom NY-style pie! I found out it came from Napoli's and have been hooked ever since.   Take it from a real, live NYC pizza snob--this is the best you will find in Las Vegas. It isn't perfect, but if you've lived here long enough, you've probably forgotten what good pizza tastes like anyway. Give it a shot; go pick up a 16\" pepperoni for just $7.99. The best part is that they recently opened a third store on Nellis, right near me. This is important; now I don't have to drive all the way to the West side and get home with a lukewarm pizza. Score!   Napoli's has an extensive menu. I have not tried even a fraction of their offerings, but aside from their delicious pizza, they have great eggplant parm and amazing, fresh-made cannoli (they make them to order--no soggy shell). I could live with or without their chicken fingers, but they're not half bad. They make a damn good Stromboli too. The pizza is definitely the star of the show, but it's worth checking out some of their other offerings if you're in the mood for something different. You probably won't be disappointed either way.",

We planed on grading the restaurant on 3 levels.  How they take the order, if they deliver on time and the quality of food.  And I have to admit they nailed it on all 3 levels.  The guy that took the order was very professional, he repeated the order back to make sure nothing was missed, gave us the  dollar amount and told us 1 hour..  Sure enough 1 hour later the bell rang.  The delivery guy was very nice, he set the food on the table and left.  We had ordered 40 wings (20 no flavor, BBQ sauce on the side and the new mango habanero flavored wings, they were amazing), we also ordered the 30\" pizza well done and boy was that good and 3 large orders of French fries.  The prices were great, $79 fed 6 adults and 10 kids.  Not too bad for 16 people..  Overall A+++.  If you haven't tried Napoli pizza, I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "This is an unfortunate review that I feel I must write. I moved to Las Vegas 6 years ago and found Napoli through a friend who knows how much I love pizza. I've lived all over the valley and chose Napoli over other places all the time. I convinced coworkers of mine to refer Napoli to guests over other pizza places that provided kickbacks to staff. They were amazing. I've converted households into Napoli pizza only houses. I had only one time where the pizza wasn't right and the manager said no problem, keep that pizza and I'll make you a better one! All of this started to change over the last few months. Delivery would take 2 hours when I was told 1 hour and 15 min. The pizza would come sliced like a kindergartner was playing in the kitchen. I like margarita pizza and they started arriving mushy, only to be told that because there were tomatoes on it, it was mushy. This was never the case before but somehow this time it was my fault. I asked the lady to fix the issue and she was kind enough to bring it back to the chef and bring it back to my table, only to find it was over cooked and burnt in some places. I realized recently the the young lady who used to be the cashier was no longer there. She was sweet as pie but probably had experienced crap changes or new crap management. Other friends of mine mentioned their recent lack of satisfaction with Napoli and I started to realize it wasn't just me...it was Napoli. Very sad and frustrated I gave them another chance. Surprise surprise, my order of one pizza and wings took two hours to arrive. I called to ask for part of my order to be refunded but some incompetent and rude manager who said his name was Bob, said no because they were busy. I told Bob that I expected a call the following day from Victor, the owner, manager or GM but he must not understand how to work a telephone because I never received a call back. The other evening I was going to a friends and said I'd bring some food. My first thought was always Napoli but I had a very bitter taste in my mouth so I decided to call and see if I could get Victor on the phone and possibly give them one last chance. I did and it was the most pointless and sickening phone conversation I've ever had which ended with victor telling me he hopes mine and my moms apartments burn down. Cool, Victor. There's a reason why Napoli sucks so bad now and I see it. You. Oh and by the way, I don't live in an apartment and nor does my mother but you never would have known that because I'd never welcome your trash establishment back to my front doorstep. I'll happily take my business elsewhere and encourage everyone I know and meet to never deal with Napoli pizza.",

A lot of pizza places leave you with that heavy feeling. I think mainly cause of the extra thick crust or the tons of toppings which really take away from the actual taste of the pizza. This pizza did remind me of pizza that I had in New York. A little greasy but let me tell you, it was like oil you wanted to drink or lick off your plate. Nasty as that sounds after you ate a slice you might think twice. A thirty inch monster of a pizza did us in. I want one now and that's the truth.",

    "text": "I work kinda late shift, and after getting a customer for an hour and a half, i wanted to order a pizza to eat while i waited. I called them, and while the service was fine, all I ordered was a large pepperoni, and they charged me $20.45. I decided that I was hungry enough, and agreed to use my card to pay. I uncomfortably read out pretty much all my card info to them (and rest assured, i will be checking my charges), and it was then that I found out it would take an hour and 25 minutes to deliver. I have no idea what you need an hour for, but late night delivery should be faster with less customers. The worst part was I found this out after they had all my credit card info, if I'd known the time first, I would've canceled, but with my info, you might as well have called it a hostage situation, When the food arrived 1 hour and 45 minutes later, i was alone and annoyed, so you can imagine my annoyance when i had to direct the driver to my address, even though I had given it over the phone, When he finally got to me, he imprinted my card (now they have image and all its info) and gave me the pizza, which was hot and delicious. I won't harp on the food, but they reallly have to up their service to get me to order again, No matter how good the food is, I'm not risking random charges and waiting 2 hours for a single pizza. Cmon Napoli, you can do better than this.",

I usually stick with a classic pepperoni pizza for my friends and I but decided to try something different this time around. I ordered the four topping 18 inch with pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers and spinach. It was very filling and flavorful. If you ask for an order of marinara sauce on the side, they don't skimp out! That was nice. My only negative for this particular experience is that I requested crushed red pepper flakes. I only recieved two small packets of them and two packets of parmesan. I would have appreciated more than two packets of crushed red pepper for a whole 18 inch pizza. Aw well, I usually have my own at home but recently ran out. Overall, this place has always made me happy and full.",

    "text": "Awful pizza, really disorganized business, definitely recommend any corporate commercial pizza place over this crap.   Truth be told me and my girlfriend were excited to relive some nostalgia and indulgent in a gluten free pizza we use enjoy from this spot.   When i first called for delivery i did have a rough experience with the person taking the call. She was really difficult to understand, had trouble understanding me, kept getting all of the orders confused and not understanding \"gluten free\".    eventually got the order through,   ~$40.00 with a $4.00 delivery fee.   price was \"fair\" but pricey for 10 wings and gluten free pizza.  delivery driver did arrive in adequate time.  Driver brought pizza looked at receipt and said....\"oh... they didnt pack the wings...\"    I had paid him as i was exchanging for pizza and then asked the guy for my money back so i could just pay him for the pizza. The dude was very apprehensive about giving me my money back. He attempted to give me $12.00 back, which would have not even covered the wings.  Basically the dude was not super solid at math.   obligatory call to generally complain and see if they had any customer service solutions. I asked for manager, no hostility, but i indicated that the order was messed up and i would not like to pay for the wings.   Manager refused to provide wings without payment, understandable, but i declined to pay.   Pizza was genuinely awful.   the crust was kind of cold and doughy (not in a good way). Cheese was really cheap tasting.  Toppings were sub par. We got a chicken topping and it was pretty crappy line chicken. oh well. Just not a good pizza.   obviously i had a bad experience, but the pizza was genuinely awful as well.  so definitely choose anything else.",

    "text": "This place advertises it is the \"Home of the 30\" pizza\".  Although it will feed a hungry family, and does taste really, really, REALLY good, I'd hope the owner reads this review and decides to market this place on something other than a giant pizza: the \"Chicago Deep Dish Stuffed\" Pizza.  It's on the menu, buried at the bottom of the pizza menu, just above the cold sandwich menu.  It's slightly highlighted, stating \"14\" for $21.99!\", but you'd miss it if you weren't looking for it.  But you won't miss it my trusty Yelp follower, because I'm here to tell you it is on the menu, and you should try it. Wait, change that, you MUST try it.  Take it from someone who's eaten at Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, Uno's and Gino's in Chicago (I'm pretty sure that's the \"Big 4\" and those who all claim to have invented the Chicago Deep Dish); this is the BEST DEEP DISH you can get outside the Chicago area.  Since we're in Vegas, I'd even say I'd put money on that statement.  Go ahead and try it, then come back here and disagree with me.  Since I was here, feeding a family of 13, I also ordered the #10 $30.99 (16\" Pizza with 1 topping, 10 Chicken Fingers, 2 liter soda and added fries for $1.00 more).  The \"regular\" pizza was a little better than any pizza you can get, anywhere else.  The garlic Parmesan chicken fingers were really good (crunchy on the outside, juicy in the inside, with just the right amount of seasoning).  The kids devoured the plate of fries, which had a batter or seasoning on them which gave them a flourly texture (very good).    The service was top notch!  Our waitress was so kind and understanding.  She took care of a table which primarily consisted of children under age 6 like a pro.    I rarely do this, but I went up to the counter to tell our waitress this was the BEST Chicago Deep Dish pizza I've had outside Chicago, and she humbly accepted the compliment.  She thanked me over and over again for saying so and asked me to please, make sure I told everyone I knew about it.  I intend to keep that promise, starting here.  So if you're in Vegas, stop by Napoli's (they've got three locations and another coming soon), and try the deep dish.  You'll be glad you did, and you'll feel cool about saying \"Yeah, I've been eating the deep dish since before they were famous for it\".",

I could put goat testicles on plastic and confidently say it tastes better than this pizza.

Next time I called I talked to the mega bitch manager to which after voicing my complaints also proceeded to hang up. They take criticism up the ass, which also happens to be where they make these so called pizzas. Fuck you Angela. Fuck you Napoli's, and fuck you manager. Do your fucking job.

Always friendly, welcoming, and seem to be in a good mood. We've all been to restaurants where they're overly stressed and it shows. Not here. These people are wonderful.   2) I've never sat and ate there, but inside looks nicely done. Clean. A few tv's with whatever game on.   3) Prices are on point! That $9 large pizza take out special is my jam! The garlic ball things are delicious (pro tip: check in and you'll get a free order of them!) I haven't explored too much of the menu (ya don't fix what isn't broke) but the prices all seem reasonable.   4) The pizza hits me the right way. I keep it simple with pepperoni, but every time I have it, it's absolutely satisfying. The garlic balls as well. I've gotten them before and they've been a little undercooked, but nothing that a little marinara couldn't fix.   5) They're pretty quick with the orders. I'm usually pick it up on my way home from work, so I'll call ahead of time to place my order. Always 20-30 minutes and by the time I get there, park, and pay, it's ready.   Basically, get you some and share the love!",

I went in with my family and i had a drink from elsewhere and said it wasn't allowed so I went outside to finish it and was told again I couldn't even be outside. I wish I could give this zero stars. Also the food isn't even good the pizza is so greasy, the wings are always purple. Don't eat here!  In response: First of all you weren't even there so why are you talking like you know what went on. Second of all you didn't even know what was in the bag, I had something else because I wouldn't want to eat your nasty greasy pizza and uncooked wings. Oh and I didn't take my family there they went there on their own. I don't decide what they eat and what they don't. It's very funny because I've read another review about your purple wings",

I've eaten their lunch specials. Dinner specials, delivery specials. Love love love them all.   What can I say? Their dough is distinctly home made, their sauce is rich but not overpowering, they use high quality cheese, and their selection of toppings is immense!   It's hilarious to me that they are situated in the same plaza as a peter piper pizza. But I guess there's no accounting for taste some times.    Do yourself a favor and check out Napoli pizza!",

Thanks to my scooby doo crew down the street giving me the best referral a girl could ask for, aka this pizza spot, my mouth just had the priviledge of having a series of orgasms, one after another, all over my mouth and tongue!! The funny thing is... our local friend already knew this place and had ordered from them several times for one delicious pizza after another, just didn't know the name off hand, nor had he been to their location.   Wooo! Yeah! So... there was three of us to feed and I didn't want there to be a shortage of pizza and/or us to be scavenging through the cupboards of our beloved friend's house late night tonight, so I wanted to go big, real big. I ordered the extra large pizza, aka 24 inches of pure pleasure (half pesto, half italian sausage) and a greek salad for the road. The salad was anything short of toppings and the pizza was so monsterous, we had to put it in the trunk of my SUV! We barely chipped away at half of it between the three of us. Crazy!   Whoa-- the pie itself was ahhhhmazing. Dough made fresh, in-house and completely soft with a touch of browned/burntness around the edges. Another yelper said epic, I will have to second that notion. EPIC PIZZA to start off an EPIC HALLOWEEN.   Their pizzas here are consistantly good (based on our temporary roomates reports) and never fall short of perfect. There was no shortage of staff to help the patrons and answer the phones as well.  The dining area was small and casual, with lots of eye candy to browse around and look at. In other words there was nothing fancy about it, except the orgasmic pizza and the screamin' Greek Salad! :) The staff was exceptionally nice as well!",

I didn't even bother putting wait for refills because no one even bothers to ask if we want any. And I understand that they are busy but the way that they run this pace is unacceptable.

I'm really happy that you guys are doing well, and have expanded, (or sold your company) so much, but the quality of your pizza went down. Way down. I don't know what you're doing differently, but it's awful. I got a pizza last night, and it's going to be the very last time. It doesn't taste the way it used to. At all. I don't know what it is, but it was horrible. If it tasted like this from the beginning, you probably wouldn't have expanded as much as you have. You should really consider going back to the way you used to make pizzas. Or go back to the ingredients that you used to use. I don't know, I just know that it tastes absolutely nothing like the way it did a few months ago. It's not just me that feels this way. My dad used to get your giant pizza every couple weeks, and since you guys changed something, he hasn't gone back. I thought he was just being crazy, but now I know that he wasn't. It's truly not tasty anymore.",

Except I found a place that's significantly better at the same price: Sicili's Pizza on Twain between Paradise and Swenson.  There's a young Russian guy there (Napoli is Russians too) named Yuri, who is a pizza savant...a prodigy of pizza. I don't know how he does it. But he really cares about what he's doing.  It's the crust; it's the ingredients.  He knows just how long to bake the pizza so that it's soft, chewy, thin, buttery, but not too hard.  In Italy, he'd get an honorary passport.",

Told them I paid  on phone for it.  The found it and said it's still in the oven and takes about an hour.  So another 30 minutes.  I will not use them again and told guy I'd yelp it, he hung up on me.  What an axxhole!  I should have ordered from naked city pizza instead.  Very aggravated.  Many of my guests have left or leaving now.  Thanks napolis for the crappy customer service and helping to ruin my event!",

He directed us here, so we went in an ordered a pizza to go. While they made the pizza we walked to a nearby grocery store and selected a six-pack to take back to the room along with the pizza. We picked up the pizza and drove back to our motel.    Back in the room we settled in and opened our pizza and our beers. The pizza was fantastic. I don't recall exactly what we got, but half was just cheese (possibly four of them?) and the other half a pretty standard pepperoni and sausage. White sauce. It really was a great pizza. The beer was less than great, but I can hardly blame Napoli for that. The room was also only so-so, as was the Discovery Channel's show about giant catfish. But the vacation sex was hot, so all-in-all, a pretty good night.   But the main point was the pizza. It was good. And now, everytime we're in Vegas, we order from them. But we stepped up the beer selection.",

I received my beer right away. Never got any of the other beverages. Had to go inside to remind the server about our drinks. Service was terrible!!! We got our pizza and fingers before we got our drinks the fingers were so hot we could not eat them. No one ever came to check on us the whole time we were there. I had to flag a server down to get our bill. So disappointed!  I'll say this over and over again.... TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!! Never will go back for dine in again.",

    "text": "I've ordered from Napoli Pizzeria several times since my last less than stellar review and I'm seriously impressed. The wait time for delivery has lessened a bit, but more importantly, everything is always done right. Every order has been correct, nothing missing, all condiments and 'extras' present, and everything is fresh and delicious. I swear even the fries have gotten better (though I can't speak for the chili).  While this store's menu is still comparable to a hundred others in the city, they do it noticeably better than most. The food is good and the service has improved. Hopefully I won't ever need to contact them about a complaint again, but I imagine it would be handled well at this point.  Napoli burgers are some of the best you can have delivered to your door. Seriously, they are legit, as are the chicken wings. I'm at a point now where I will recommend Napoli to friends.  Keep doing what you're doing, guys, and I'll keep ordering.",

It's nestled in the middle of a half-abandoned shopping center, but it wasn't too hard to find for an out-of-towner like myself. The front register was run by a couple of tough-looking Eastern Euro chicks, one of which seemed annoyed that I couldn't understand what she was asking through her thick accent.   Before food came, I had to use the bathroom. Normally, this would be a nonevent. However, the bathroom can only be found after navigating a labyrinthine maze of doors. I was concerned I'd wind up getting locked out of at least one of them, which would have led to a damn long walk back to the front. But I survived. Food came, and it looked like hammered shit. Seriously. So consider me surprised when I dug in to find that it was actually really damn good. We got a small pizza and some chicken tenders. I was kinda \"meh\" on the tenders. So rare is it that I get chicken fingers that don't taste like store brand crap. But the pizza here was really good. Cheesy, great sauce, crisp crust... just about everything I require in a good slice.",

They did not care about the issue, they did not want to refund us our money, and they told us that the driver wasn't even on his way here and that it will still take another hour for the second pizza to arrive. HORRIBLE!!! NEVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN! Also, the dough on the pizza tasted old! Everything was just HORRIBLE! DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM EVER!!!!!!!!!

They serve lunch specials here and I was in luck to caught the specials. I ended deciding on a sample type plate for $9.99 which is a large slice of cheese pizza, small portion of french fries, 3 buffalo hot wings, and a drink. The cheese slice was so good and fresh too. The buffalo wings were in mild and the sauce was very good with blue cheese sauce on the side of course for dipping.  The twins were with me and I ordered them a small 10 inch pepperoni pizza with mild hot wings too. When I checked in I was offered the free garlic balls and I redeemed them too. So thanks Napoli for thinking about yelpers, they were delicious . And the order was huge not some small sampling it is a large 6oz container and it's topped all over with Parmesan cheese. Dessert is a must and we shared a slice of the chocolate cake. The slice of cake was really dry, but the frosting on it seemed professional done. I enjoyed eating the frosting by itself too since it was so good. Not a bad place to enjoy some pizza among friends.",

    "text": "Napoli may have one of the best-valued lunch special menus in town. The amount of food you can get for less than $10 is staggering. First, my group used a Yelp check-in coupon to get a HEAPING plate full of free garlic knots that my group of three grown men couldn't finish. I am a huge chicken finger fan, so I ordered the (3) chicken fingers lunch special for $9.20. I usually need more than three fingers to fill me up, but the server assured me these were decent-sized fingers, and she was right. They were decent, but I probably wouldn't order them very often. And that is because of the SIZE OF THE PIZZA SLICES my friends ordered. So, for something like $6.88, you get these two colossal-sized slices of either cheese or pepperoni pizza. We are talking enormous. NEither of my friends was able to even start their second slice, so they packed them up and saved them for later. Is this the best italian joint in town? Not by a long shot. Does the food, spacious atmosphere, friendly service and value make it a solid spot to have on your work lunch rotation? Absolutely. Give Napoli a shot.",

I work directly across the street and we are a major customer since it's so convenient, however, time and time again Napoli's proves to be putting their efforts in all the wrong places.   Today, my team and I ordered a pizza this morning and it very easily should have been done within 30 min. My colleague received an email stating that the order was not going to be completed.   We then moved on with ordering pizzas from Pizza Hut were the order was ready in 15 minutes and piping hot! Well to our surprise when getting the order from our Front Desk - our Napoli's pizza was delivered but here we are about 2 hours later and they refuse to refund our card for the order.   So now we are stuck with a pizza that we didn't intend on receiving and the money will not be refunded. You are the ones that advised the order was not going to be completed but yet you still delivered it and Falsely charged the card.  Your customer service needs a lot of growth - being greedy gets you no where.   PS: The Napoli's pizza was extremely greasy so much so that the front desk had to take place paper towels beneath the box. The slices of pizza that were in the box were dripping in grease and was completely non-edible. The pizza was over cooked on top of that and due to it sitting made it stiff as a concrete pillar.   I whole heartedly will make it my task to advise all employees to NOT fill your greedy pockets. That's a whole building of 500+ employees.",

I call them and they don't offer anything to fix the problem, they just said, I CAN SEND THE REST OF YOUR FOOD IF YOU WANT TO, WAIT ANOTHER 30 MIN AND WE WILL SEND IT, OR I'LL GIVE YOU SOME CREDIT IF YOU ORDER NEXT TIME.

    "text": "Pretty alright pizza from Napoli the amount of sauce was my main issue a little dry but definitely not overcooked or doughy. There is some flop on these puppies and for a pineapple chicken pizza some of the topping was placed so some of the pieces were mostly cheese.    I usually order double pepperoni and chicken wings but tried the hot chicken fingers out this time. The cashier told us upon ordering that their hot is THAT  kindaHOTthe hot was hot but not scary hot. There are chili pepper seeds visible on the chicken after bieng tossed, great flavor not oversaturated at all, and the breading was enough to hold some crunchy bits. I feel like i would order them again if i felt like chicken finger foods. Also the size of the strips were fairly generous.    The yelp check allows you to obtain an order of garlic balls! These lil nuggets have butter garlic and cheese sprinkled on a to go box packed with dough bites or joy. A tasty addition tomost of the fare available on their menu. Large parties should order a second helping as ghese will disappear swiftly!  Dining area was clean and speedy service of under 30 minutes on a Tuesday afternoon. Not the best pizzas but def better than most Napoli's is worth the visit especially for larger groups and pizza functions!",

Never ordering white pizza anywhere else but here! Also my hubby loved their Philly steak \"bomb\" sub, it was huge and over stuffed w/ steak, bacon, mushrooms, peppers, & melty Swiss I think(not fake nacho cheese) the fries it came w/ was good too, not soggy and perfectly seasoned.

    "text": "First let me preface this review, I do not like giving bad reviews.  Napoli Pizza & Restaurant has Dine-in, take out and delivery.  Their menu has soups, appetizers, salads, chicken wings & fingers, chicken dinners, ribs, hot & cold sandwiches, hamburgers, pasta, veal, desserts, a children's menu and Pizza.   their pricing is about average for what they serve.  I like Pizza, I have had a number of different types of pizza, different places around the world and there are a few things that I expect when I order a pizza for delivery. First the pizza be there when I am told it would arrive, Napoli Pizza was in the time frame that they say they would arrive. That was the best part of the experience.  The Pizza I ordered was a 24\" Alfredo Pizza with Canadian Bacon. The pizza toppings was in the center of the pizza, about what you would expect on a 14\" or 16\" pizza. The Canadian Bacon was cut up deli ham (I love Canadian Bacon on my pizza, when I order Canadian Bacon I expect Canadian Bacon). The center of the pizza was soggy, and the dough did not appear to be cooked all the way. I am not sure if it was because they cooked it and let it sit in the box awhile or if it was just under cooked. The outside edge of the pizza was brown. Instead of the traditional wedge cut slices the pizza was cross cut into small squares, and most of the time it was not cut all the way through. That could have been because it was such a large pizza.  Overall I can give them 1 star for being on time, however, the pizza although barely edible, it is not a pizza I would ever order from them again, so I give 1 star for the pizza.   They have a very large selection on their menu, unfortunately, because of the experience I had with the pizza I will not sample any other items, This is one delivery menu I will be throwing away.",

Meaning after waiting 2 hours I still had to go get food from somewhere else. Too bad we refer a lot of people there at my boyfriends work but that will stop immediately. Hopefully they actually refund the money. Doubtful though and they'll probably give our rejected food to someone else.",

    "text": "This was my first and last time ordering from Napoli's pizza.  We ordered Mozz Sticks, Eggplant Parm Sandwich w/ Fries, and Chocolate Cake.    Pros - It WAS Super Bowl Sunday and we still received our order in under an hour.  Cons - everything else.  Even though my order was delivered within an hour, it tasted like it had probably been done a good 45mins before I got it (I live no more than 15mins away).  The Mozz sticks were solid...like they were cooked and sat for so long they got cold and were just solid sticks of cheese covered in breading.  When I ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich I asked them to add Ricotta cheese, I didn't see or taste any.  While the sauce was good, there wasn't nearly enough of it.  There was no sauce on the bread, so the eggplant was very dry, only a thin layer of sauce on top.  In addition to that, the eggplant wasn't cooked very well, I couldn't chew through most of it.  Then the chocolate cake - it was terrible.  It was dry and just didn't taste very good.  Like I said, my FIRST AND LAST time ordering from this pizzeria.",

I can also say that their philly steak and gyro is also consistently good.",

I've work in food and beverage for a long time so i know how to debate when it comes to bad service.. Then after a long debate he finally gave up and told me that let me ask my manager.. After their conversation he offered me that he can replace my order with fresh and half one but with one condition im only giving you half of what you order.. I was really pissed!!! Paid $40+ and only got half of my order and I need to drive back to this shit hole to get my half and return my cold full order. The supervisor was Indian forgot his name. Don't eat at this place!!!

Really? I have never waited 2 hours for ANY pizza. So did it take 2 hrs to actually get the pizza cooked or has it been sitting under a heat lamp for two hrs waiting for a delivery person? Don't solicit or leave your flyer at or even near my home if you can't deliver a flipping pizza in the proper amount of time.  I would never ever recommend this place.",

There are only two things that i dislike about Napoli; the pizza is overly greasy in my opinion, and the restaurant can get a loud at times, but not so loud that it becomes unenjoyable. I would recommend this place for anyone who's looking for a good meal.",

    "text": "I order from Napoli's atleast two/three times a month, every time that I order the pizza it is good. Last night after a 12 hour shift, I stopped by to get dinner. I ordered the 5 piece mild finger and fries for $9.99. First off that price is a bit steep for a 5 piece and fries, especially without a drink. The lady asked how would I like my fingers. \"mild\" Okay mild is mild... I get home and began to eat my \"mild\" fingers, and to my surprise the fingers where EXTREMELY HOT! As I stated I worked a long day, needless to say I called it a night and ate something from home, and went to bed. I woke up, called Napoli's at 10:00 am. I asked for a manager,and the person who answered the phone says\" I am an employee how can I help you. Now, I don't know about you, but when I call a business and ask to speak with a manager that is WHO I want to speak with...a person claiming to be the \"manager\" got on the phone. I explained the situation. He literally said that \"you should of called last night, and because I waited and called this morning there is nothing he could do for me!\" I almost hit the floor. I explained that I still have the food. I couldn't finish it, because it was too HOT. He then ask me if,I asked the waiter \"how exactly is the mild!\" HUH, REALLY!!!!! So, he then begins to explain that their mild and hot are composed of a hot sauce with crushed peppers which makes it spicy. He then says well the mild is spicy, but not hot. After going NO WHERE with this person I finally said that although the pizza is good, I will not patronize  business who would rather lose a customer than replace the food. I told the \"manager\" that I will tell all my friends/coworkers/ son's football team about their service. I also told him that I would be writing this review, to share my experience. In the end, the conversation went nowhere. I was really surprised that his stance was \"I didn't call last night, so therefore he can do nothing about it!\"",

    "text": "So we came in February 14th around 8pm. We have never been here before and were told to take a seat. We sat at table #14 and after about 10 minutes no one has even greeted us at our table. So I didn't know if we ordered up at the counter or at the table so I made my way to the counter and got some lady's attention and she told me that they would be right with me and the waitress with blonde hair interrupted and told me that she already asked me if I was ready to order and she'll be right with me?? Okay that was for the table next to us. So after about another 7 minutes I'm trying to make eye contact with her and she doesn't acknowledge me not once. So then a younger waitress with ombre hair helps us order and after me telling her I want fries she then asks \"would you like to add fries\" lol girl are you not listening? So I was like okay whatever not a big deal. AFTER 15 MINUTES we finally get our 2 drinks. A simple water and a coke... 15 minutes is way too long for 2 drinks. And we finally receive our fries and wings after about another 10 minutes. So it took 25 minutes for that to get out. And add another 15 minutes for the WRONG pizza to come out. The ombre girl came back to our table and said \"you guys didn't say Hawaiian?\" So finally the correct pizza comes out. The food was okay 7/10 but the service was horrible. First the blonde lady tells me that she already greeted and told us that she had previously said she was going to get our order which never happened then the ombre girl didn't care enough to pay attention to the word \"fries\" or \"supreme pizza\"",

The initial reactions from others partaking in this beast is worth the price alone.  We had a party of 6 and still had a ton of leftovers!  I ordered at 10am on a football Sunday.  Obviously a busy time for them so it took over an hour for it to arrive but no big deal.  I was very impressed that I could view the entire menu, make my order and pay for the pizza through the Yelp app via eat24 with such ease.  Delivery was the only way I could get this pizza home unless I wanted to clean out my car trunk to make space or rent a U-haul anyways.    We ordered the supreme which had all the usual suspects for toppings.  I honestly thought the crust wasn't going to be very good due to the size but it was alright.  Someone taking a blindfold test between this and Metro would probably say Metro was better but it's all about the show with this \"pie\".",

The lady informed me that they do not serve slices over the weekend. Then said sorry and watched as I left. I ended up taking my business to the Chamango snack shop around the corner. \"Great business by the way\" I felt as though they did not want to serve me. I decided to go on my lunch break that following Wednesday. I walked in and stood there waiting to be assisted. It had been at least 5 minutes and there were at least 7 people behind the counter. 4 up front and 3 in the back. All acting as if they are doing something in an empty restaurant on a Wednesday around 5pm. I walk up to the guy after he signaled me and ask for a slice of pizza. He tells me they stop serving slices at 3pm. He did not offer anything to me. I looked at him with great disappointment. As I turned away and walked down the way to the Chamango establishment, who appreciated me coming in. Neither of the employees offered me something else. Neither employee asked or even compromised with me to make me a happy customer that would return. I could have been talked into buying a full pizza with wings, and garlic knots; on how hungry I was. Granted I would have shared the food with others, and recommended this place to eat. Because of the shitty service and how I felt. I will never step foot into this place again. For what it's worth, I hope this place shuts down and builds on their customers service. I felt like because of the person I am, they did not want to, nor felt the need to serve me. Then I see that there are 3 stars, now I know why. Napoli pizza's customers service is straight garbage.",

Most come here for the takeout special: 16\", 1 topping glorious ness for a mere $7. Really can't be beat. Add in a massive salad ($6-10) to pretend you're being healthy, and you've got dinner for like, five people.   I ate two slices  and a good portion if the salad and was stuffed. Their price for size/value is good.   Service was friendly and fast. Packed plates and utensils with out takeout order, along with cheese and peppers, which was a nice touch.  Ordered the Greek salad, think I accidentally got the gyro salad by mistake. It it was still great. Would get again- fresh, crunchy salad with plenty of meat and cheese, and an entire tomato! Pizza hot and fresh, good sauce that wasn't too sweet, crust was thin but still had some crunch to it.",

They didn't skimp on the toppings which is nice but it wasn't my favorite. The crust was a little soggy for my liking and they put the brocolli stems as a topping as  well. Usually you have just the florets but they chopped up the stems and put them on their like soggy bell pepper. Kind of weird.   We also ordered fried mozzarella sticks which were okay, they tasted like the frozen kind you buy at the grocery store. The fried mushrooms weren't very good, half were overcooked/burnt. The potato skins were dried out and lacked flavor. I did enjoy the Italian wedding soup though. It has good flavor and tons of pasta and meatballs.   Probably wouldn't order delivery from them again considering that the only thing I enjoyed was the soup.",

When it comes to the deals they always seem to have a special going on the particular day of whatever the deal maybe which is good if your not looking to spend too much on food. As for the food I had the chicken wings although not the best and they were a little over cooked I still enjoyed them the fries were fresh and crispy and tasty and not the fries you get at a place like angelinas pizza place where the fries are overcooked and inedible here they cook them fresh and they are really good and I enjoyed them overall. I see myself either ordering from here again or eating inside the staff are really friendly and helpful",

For a special event we had them deliver and the delivery man asked if we already paid when we got to the door....ummm shouldn't you know that? In which we did, but he had to call the restaurant as we sat there and waited. Even recently I wanted to try them again....I was told 30min-1hr wait..Totally fine. Then it's pushing TWO hours and I have to keep calling to see what's going on and when I ask for a manager, I get a woman that keeps calling me \"sweetie\" every other second. The food finally arrives...they forget the chicken tenders. In which I wouldn't be so annoyed, but we had kids here. I had to call again and the manager actually told me to not touch the mistaken wings and they will TRADE our order. I explained to her she has to be kidding. After talking to her manager (yeah, I was confused about that too) she decided we graciously were \"allowed\" to keep the wings...thanks? Another 20+minutes later a man knocks on the door, hands us the bag and walks away.  Service: Zero stars  Whoever the \"manager\" was that day: the condescending way of speaking to customers is a joke  A bunch of better places to get pizza so I'll pass from now on",

I've had Napoli pizza at a party once, so I figured it would be okay. We walk inside are are immediately acknowledged, but avoided. No one is here, there are over 9 employees that we can see. One of which is on FaceTime, another of which is dropping a 2 liter bottle of coke on the ground exploding it all over the wall. So anyways, we sit down at what they called \"table 1\" and we begin to look over the over crowded, badly sectioned menu. The waitress comes around three times before we order anything. 10\" pizzas were not on the menu, and they aren't selling slices, so we decided to branch out and get subs. We waited 45 minutes for our food to come out- which was cold???? But hard and appeared to be hot??? They placed a slice of pickle on my sisters plate, that had NO moisture to it at all- like the bitch tried to WRING it out!!! She goes inside to get a box and the waitress sees her, and turns around. My sister comes back outside, sits for a couple minutes and decides to try again, but also buy some fries since they were the ONLY edible thing we were given. She openly tells the waitress that this was the worst food we've had and we really aren't happy with it and she says \"ooooh\". That's it. Never asked what was wrong, never asked to fix it, never showed interest. Because my sister is up there, they try to give her the cannoli I ordered AGES ago-but the guy snatches it back and says \"actually, I'll make a new one\"....which is odd considering it was done???? But okay????   Moral of the story is that the food sucked, the service sucked, and I will never be returning.",

I order off of an app and was disappointed that with the 20 wings in my order, I didn't have the option to do two flavors. Oh well! Still good wings. My work has ordered from here a few times before and it has been delicious (especially the garlic knots that come with marinara... I think.)  I ordered the 16-inch 1-topping pizza that came with 20 wings, ranch, 2-liter of soda and carrots/celery.  Their pizza is so good and worth the price. A bit greasy but whatever. For the wings flavor, I got hot buffalo and yup that was perfectly hot after wing 6.  When I picked up my order, I asked for crushed peppers and Parmesan. The blonde employee kindly got a small bag for me. They offer paper plates if needed.  Inside looks really nice, clean and bright. They have their desserts on display in a case. Looked good, but eating all of this alone, I thought...better not. Hahah.",

I feel disgusted and I'm literally about to vomit over the thought of someone's hair from who knows where was on top of my pizza.. This business needs a SERIOUS health inspection because I can't even begin to imagine how the kitchen REALLY looks like .....",

It was late and I did not want to bother with calling them back I just threw it all in the trash.  Very Disappointed also I am going to ask my Complex to bar them from posting their ads in my complex.",

After about nearly 3 hours of waiting they claimed that they had just gotten the order in their system and said that the delivery is on the way and should be about 5 min, now nearly 20 minutes later we are STILL waiting on the pizza. After the pizza delivery comes he hands over the the pizza and we open it to find out that's it's not the order we placed, about 10 minutes later the pizza delivery guy comes back with the pizza we ordered. Now this is the more disappointing part, we call to complain to the manager and he proceeds to tell us that it was the delivery guys fault for bringing the wrong pizza and made it seem like we were at fault for ordering through a third party website or app. Regardless.....after waiting nearly 3 hours for our pizza all he said was an apology and that he can't do nothing else with a negative tone and a disgusting attitude. Never ordering here again.",

They have teriyaki style and many other choices. The pizza is the BEST NY style we've had here in Las Vegas and at a great price. Thin & slightly crispy with REAL cheese, well seasoned sauce and REAL pepperoni, not that HORMEL stuff. As soon as we finished we wanted another one.

It's like alot of other places in Vegas (Angelinas, Cafe Verdi etc.) They have everything you could ever think of on the menu. Fried Mushrooms, Zuchinni sticks, Jalapeno Poppers etc. I have had their pizza before, its good. So opted for a lunch special. Philly, Fries and a drink. Great price, but nothing stood out to me with the Philly. I don't know if its because I work for a place where we make our own bread, but the bread wasn't that great, very airy, like there was no substance or flavor to it. The beef itself was so-so, had a very mild taste to it, when combined with mushrooms and peppers. It was like they hardly put seasonings on it. If you're looking for a place that has a great pizza, and with a huge variety of other entrees and appetizers, this is the place, I am sure there is something for everyone.",

Sure, they may have a long wait time, be a bit privy, and have forgotten part of my order at the store before, but I've always dealt with it because frankly, they're accommodating and give you a LOT of food.  However, tonight showed me just how little they care about their customers.  I have never had a problem ordering multiple flavors on my chicken fingers or upgrading (for a hefty fee) regular fries to curly fries, but tonight I was flat out told \"no\" and that it was \"company policy.\"  Upon calling back to cancel my order, I didn't even get an apology.  I work face-to-face with customers at a fortune-500 company and know that a good rule of thumb is that even if you can't accommodate a customer,  to at LEAST apologize for it.  I am seriously sad to say I can no longer be a Napoli customer due to their severely poor customer service skills, and I hope others will stand to not put up with it either.",

They have an awesome pick up special for $7.99 where you get a 16 inch 1 topping pizza. I'm saving the 30 inch pizza for a special occasion. They also have Italian soda and homemade lemonade. They are open until 2am and Thursday through Saturday they are open until 3am. The restaurant is kind of small but they have really great lunch specials. Actually....

    "text": "So I ordered a Sicilian pie from Napoli. My advice is to avoid it. You're better off with a regular pie. I also discovered if you want it to be a good pie, you need to order it slightly well or well. I don't know if it's the ovens Napoli uses or the crappy dough, but ordering it Well makes it better. Traditional pizza dough in a traditional brick oven doesn't need to be ordered well to be good, but this pizza does. When you order their pizza regular, the crust is mush and the bottom of the slice is white as can be. For the uninformed, pizza is supposed to be golden brown to brown on the bottom. Anything less and it's undercooked or practically raw. I kinda find it ridiculous that so many pizzerias find that concept so difficult. Usually, inferior Conveyor Air Ovens are the culprit. They may cook a pizza quicker, but they will never compare to a brick oven. Hope this helps some of you.  After a few more times ordering, I still in good conscience can only rate this place 3 stars.",

I would take the blame for this if I hadn't repeated back to her twice to confirm that she said \"25 minutes\". So an hour after we place the order, the food shows up. Everyone was asleep, so it went straight to the fridge. The next morning we discover that they didn't even provide the food we ordered (somehow \"Turkey Club with no tomato\" sounds like \"Bruschetta\"?!). After complaining and having the customer service person not only interrupt me, but shout OVER me on the phone, they send the driver to pick up the incorrect order and credit my account. We had to wait 30 minutes to check out for the driver to arrive because he demanded that we not leave it at the door for him. Then they don't even credit my account. What a disaster! I will NEVER even consider ordering from them again.",

    "text": "I like this kinda pizza. Floppy and thin with a thick non greasy flour dusted crust. The pepperoni and sauce, very tasty. Over all hey for 7 bux I would rather buy this than at some overpriced chain. Further more I got wings,fries, a drink and a 16\" pepperoni for 15 bux! Cant get that at ANY national brand pizza chain, you would looking at damn near 40 bux! Yes, they seem a lil cranky but who cares foods good and its cheap. I can deal with a little lack of service to save a fistfull of cash. I would also like to add, I dont know who she is but the cashier was a dark haired beauty. Again, great pizza, great price and a little eye candy to boot. Im not complaining! The interior of the restaurant isnt as cold and sterile as I thought it would be from pictures I found online. Its actually quiet, they're is plenty of room for a large party or if its just a small family of three. Heres the BIGGY! When you drive into the complex from sahara, your going to drive through the shopping center and turn left at the end. and then a another left to its front door Its directly across from fit for ten.",

I have never eaten their pizza so I can't testify to that, but their Italian food is sososo yummy. I think I've tried everything on the Baked Pasta & Specials part of the menu. My fave is the baked ravioli. Sometimes I can't make up my mind and I'll get Whole Lotta Pasta which is incredible. Oh. . .and get the garlic balls! God, they are good. I order from Napoli probably once every 3 weeks for delivery to my apartment. Never had a problem with my order and the food is so good. You won't be sorry. Hey. . .anybody ever try the ribs?  By the way, for the New Yorker out there? Get over yourself. You all didn't invent pizza and if you miss the NY variety  so bad, go home.",

    "text": "Had been a semi-frequent customer of Napolis due to takeout specials and occasionally good pizza.  However, the rude service we got yesterday will be the last time we go there. I heard my husband order the mushroom topping, but when we got home with our pizza, we had a pepperoni pizza. My husband spoke to someone named Angela, and explained the situation and asked if they could do something for us as we did not want to drive back to get a new pizza. She said she KNEW we ordered pepperoni but they would deliver a new pizza to us for free! Great, right?  Well, a minute later our phone rang and Angela was calling to argue again that we've always ordered pepperoni and did this time too! She insisted that we ordered the wrong pizza but she would deliver us a new pizza, as if we were idiots and she never made a mistake. Her bad attitude was unbelievable and confrontational!! My husband was as nice as can be to her and was not expecting to argue over a pizza topping.  And other reviewers are correct. You get alot of stares from employees when you walk in and are ignored for quite awhle before you are even spoken to. There are too many good pizza places in town to deal with such rudeness. Not to mention the fact that the pizzas are sometimes raw and undercooked or in the case of our pepperoni pizza yesterday burnt on the edges. So long Napolis and get rid of that rude worker Angela!!!!",

We went for lunch and that brings me to main positive comment which is their special: 2 giant slices with cheese or pep with a drink for $5.99. I did wait a little long for mine, but when I got it I would say it was decent. When very hot it was pretty good although greasier than many. After cooling off it wasn't really worth eating. Some of the party liked it, but overall nothing special and I have to rate it low mostly for the service. I've never been to a pizza place that took this long to serve pizza. Also, one person who came a bit later and ordered a little after us waited 35 minutes for her sandwich and when we were ready to leave she was told that it would be 10 more minutes. So, she got her money back and had someone else's leftover pizza.",

    "text": "As someone who spent the last four years living in NYC, I'm very familiar with \"New York style\" pizza. In fact, I lived above Rosario's on the Lower East Side, where I'd grab a *perfect* pepperoni slice four times a week. So naturally I was excited to read about Napoli.  Expecting to be wowed, I dialed in a delivery order for an 18\" pie with pepperoni and onions for about $18. When it arrived an hour later, the results were immediately disappointing.   First of all, let's make something clear. \"New York style\" pizza is not rocket science. It's defining quality is simplicity--a thin, floppy slice with fresh tomato sauce. When it's really good, there's a pool of grease on the surface that rolls down your arm. Shake some pepper flakes and powdered garlic on it and you're done. It should never be crispy, \"doughy\" or covered with pretentious crap. Anything beyond pepperoni is pushing it.   This pizza, on the other hand, was bready and sweet. The cheese formed a film which slid off in your mouth. I didn't find the ingredients especially flavorful, fresh or abundant. Adding insult to injury, there was a $3.50 delivery charge and the driver gave me lip for going \"out of his way.\" In sum, it was typical suburban pizza, marginally better than the major chains but thoroughly pedestrian.   Now, I'll concede that the debate on what constitutes a True \"New York style\" pizza will undoubtedly continue raging for centuries. But here's two things to consider: 1) Not all pizza in New York is good. 2) Not all New Yorkers have good taste. In fact, many are perfectly happy with Sbarro and Domino's. I am not one of them. Indeed, I feel a certain responsibility to defend the \"New York\" monicker from those who would profit from its misuse. If my critique of Napoli seems harsh, I beg you to keep this in mind.",

I don't think that I've seen the same delivery driver twice.   I have only continued to reorder because every once in a while, they make the best pizza and other amazing food. Unfortunately, more often than not, the pizza comes cold, undercooked, with only a small amount of toppings. There have been times to where I could swear they were serving manufactured dough/cardboard. I literally started ordering online so that I didn't have to deal with the person answering the phone due to broken english.   I also love their potato skins...when done properly. Most of the time they come severely over or under cooked with two shreds of cheese and one piece of bacon.   I've had better luck ordering during the day and with their really big pizzas.  Unfortunately, the bad is out weighing the good and will not be reordering for at least while.",

We had the balsamic dressing and totally enjoyed the salad and the amazing pizza.  Highly recommend it!

Welp, not at Naploi's.   I was working at the Barrett Joackson Car Auction at Mandalay Bay and we had a lot of hungry workers to feed. Of course pizza is a go to in a situation like that. We called up Napoli's and ordered three 30-inch pizzas. One with half plain cheese, and half veggies. The other two we got the meat lovers.   First off - awesome they could deliver to us at the Auction as it was a busy event and the pizza delivery person had to call us and park in a parking lot not on the property. He waited for us to walk out to get the pizzas.  Everyone who was eating the pizza said the same thing: GREAT PIZZA! I personally thought the cheese was the best part. The meat was plentiful, as were the veggies. The meat pizza was a bit too greasy for me, but it was still good. But the veggie one was amazing! So many vegetables! They did not skimp. Although, I do think there were a bit too many onions. I picked a bunch off my slice, but hey, some people may like that many. *shrug*  Obviously I've never dined-in, but the delivery service is awesome and the pizzas made a whole lot of hungry people VERY happy!",

I ordered  three giant size pizzas with drinks, and the total came up to almost $100. I called the night before to have the order ready by 11 AM. I called in the morning to confirm my order and they said that they were making it. When I got there at 11 AM I stood at the front counter for 15 minutes before somebody even acknowledge that I was there. Finally when the cashier asked if she can help me, I asked for my order and it wasn't ready. She then asked me if I could wait 30 minutes so that they can complete the order. I explained to her that the food was for a business meeting and that I have been bragging about Napolis pizza. I had no other choice but to wait 30 minutes and have my fellow colleagues and boss wait for me. On top of that my boss would call me every two minutes to check and see where I was. This was my review, And this was my experience maybe some of you have had better experiences but unfortunately this was mine and it was the last time that I ever went to Napolis, or ever referred somebody to this restaurant. Amazing pizza though",

As I read on other reviews, the ribs are definitely tender but they should bring the bbq sauce they put on the ribs to the quality level of the meat.  The spicy wings were decent and good size...no complaints here.  The bad... the cheese pizza was not edible.  It arrived cold but even warmed up it was a four out of ten at best.  The french fries that come with ribs were limp, no flavor..skip them and get salad.  Overall 2.5 stars",

    "text": "Welp ordered combo app platter and a lrg bbq chicken pizza and when they delivered the food it was cold, soggy and tasted strange. When my boyfriend called to sort out a replacement the girl speaking on the phone hung up on him. When I called the girl that picked up said she was the manager. So I explained my dissatisfaction with the food she began to tell me there was nothing she could do. After a few moments of frustration she put me on hold. Another girl picked the phone up and asked what the problem was and explained that she was the manager. Well as to no surprise I'm very frustrated at this point. The reason I originally had asked to speak to a manager its so I wouldn't have to repeat myself 3 different times.  While I was expressing my want for a refund this girl kept interrupting me and being rude. Finally after back and forth I was placed on hold again....low and behold I guess now I was finally speaking to the actual manager. The only reason the place even gets 1 star is because after a few minutes he finally arranged a refund.  Sucky pizza..sucky customer service..not cool!",

We got half hawaiian, half pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom. The pizza was fantastic, we'd definitely go there again, no question. My husband is a wings guy and he enjoyed them, though he can never get his wings spicy enough, so naturally, he didn't think they were as hot as he would have liked.   Fun atmosphere, too... our waitress was really nice and let us take a picture with her and a 30\" pizza for fun. The staff is great.. laughing and joking with everyone. Highly recommended!",

I read a couple reviews that said their crust was fabulous and since I am big in to crust, I decided to order. I got the Specialty Pizza with olives, pepperoni, bacon and feta cheese.  Despite all the reviews I read earlier, the staff was nothing but friendly. They weren't overly friendly but they weren't rude, either.  The delivery did take an hour, the pizza is pretty big (18\") but I have seriously had better. Honestly, I would have rather ordered papa johns and would have paid less for better quality AND it would have come to my place a lot faster. I will not be ordering from them again. It tastes just like my local greasy pizza bar down the street from me. They're nothing special, at all.",

    "text": "Second time here; my first experience would have been...probably a 3.5 star, but I'm glad I came back to get a better picture.  It's around 730pm on a Monday night. My best friend wanted pizza and I wanted fries, so we go to dine-in at Napoli's. Their extensive menu is convenient as he can get his pizza fix and I can get my frenchy fry on.  Now here is where we go on a roller coaster ride... Walking in: no greeting whatsoever. Lots of staring, no smiling. Both girls at the counter are on the phone. Seems standard enough. Ordering: One girl at the counter was on the phone and although I can never be too sure, she did not look like she was taking an order at all. She was leaning back against the counter and just casually chatting into the phone. She looks at me and I smile at her, waiting patiently. She stares and keeps talking. A few moments pass, she's still on the phone, and I'm getting looks from the cooks in the back. Finally, she yells out for the other girl to come out and take my order while she resumes talking on the phone. I don't know who takes that long to order food from a restaurant but they really had this chick occupied. Finally, the other lady comes out and I put my order in. Food/Service: The other lady is actually really nice, and she made our experience a lot better. She was friendly, talked and joked with us, which is nice since we didn't really feel like we were getting any attention at this place (did I mention we were the only patrons here?). We had ordered calamari, pasta (came with garlic bread and a side salad), a small supreme pizza, chicken alfredo, and curly cheese fries with bacon bits. Everything was good except the fries. Ready to quench my thirst for greasy, fried potato goodness, I stabbed my fork into the fries, only to find the combination of fries, cheese, and bacon had melded into a solid brick of lukewarm lard. I am beginning to get the idea that this basket has been sitting for a while, as it was also the last thing to come from the kitchen (when it should have been one of the first). Hmm. I take it back to the front, asking if I can return it. I didn't even want them to make another. Nice Lady says she'll have to ask her manager and tells me to give her a few moments. She comes back out to say her manager is busy and to give her about five minutes. I go back to sit down.   By the time we were done with our meal, we still haven't heard from the manager. Best Friend tells me to forget about it. So we do. Consider it their tip.  Bottom line is, the food is mostly good, but the service is terrible. 90% of the time, the girls at the counter were on the phone. I'm pretty sure they were answering phone orders, but that one extremely rude girl was pretty much on the phone the ENTIRE TIME we were there, except to give us our pizza. Staff seemed to stare a lot...but that might be because we were the only ones in the restaurant.",

We took this to mean it would be a priority order.  Instead it's been about 1/12 hrs. which was longer than the original order and the driver has not arrived.  We called the store and were given a run around. The correction to this order was clearly not a priority.  Shame on Napoli",

I have always ordered them Plain with the hot sauce on the side to keep them crispy on the way home. The Person who was helping me looked to be the manger wanted to charge extra just to do that. Charging to have sauce on the side on chicken wings WTF, Really? In the past they never did this. I told them to skip wings then. I'll give my money to some place else.",

I called a half hour after the driver was supposed to have been here and they told me he left 15 minutes ago.....one hour later he showed up. But the service tonight was terrible, this girl was being argued with by the guys that run the place because her soda was flat. They refused to give her a fresh one and they would not even give her a refill on a fountain drink I could not believe how terrible they treated her. My girlfriend and I were disgusted at the way they treated her. We will NEVER return to Napoli's pizza again and I assume that girl and her family will never return. I enjoy customer service, Napoli's finally got bad enough to lose me...the food isn't good enough to warrant treating people like that.",

So at 8:30 I was concerned and called ou to be told they have a third party ordering on there website that routed my order to this location. Mind you I live on charleston and nellis. There is a napolis 5-10 min down the road. Now I wasn't asking for any compensation but when the woman on the phone had additude and said not my problem I requested her manager who also said not my problem. He stated this was my <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpizza.com&s=c0ab506a7da1c4473cd97cb8bfab0b086bb9d0da33903b61a2bc57205f47feb2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pizza.com</a> has problems and nothing he can do but either send the order out and wait another 20-30 min or cancel the order and have the store by me make it. I said send it then. The manager was completely rude and unhelpful. And I received $50 worth of food soggy and less than desirable. When the delivery driver got here and asked how I was I said mad and he said not my fault. I don't think I will ever order again. Which sucks cause I've been ordering from napoli's for years. Smh.",

Don't be fooled into thinking that if the pizza portions are huge that the quality probably sucks...that would definitely be a mistake. The pizza quality is actually amazingly good...probably my favorite in Vegas...better than Grimaldi's in my opinion...but also totally different styles. I think it is probably Napoli's crust that actually makes their pizza...not too thick or thin and cooked to perfection. The crust, to me, almost seems very slightly sweet??? But not in a bad way. We have ordered tons of pizza's from here and my one comment about their Veggie pizza is that they really load a lot of vegetables onto the pizza...so when it cooks a lot of the moisture from the vegetables cooks out onto the pizza and if you don't eat it quickly then the crust can get slightly soggy. I don't mind it but my family members have commented on that several times. Otherwise I don't think you will find too many complaints with this establishment. On Friday & Saturday nights the place is really busy and can almost seem slightly chaotic...the way to beat the madness is to simply have them deliver the food instead. Their delivery people are quite speedy!",

But when it's good, it's good.   The pizza is thin crust and can be greasy. When delivery takes too long, the bottom tends to get soggy which is gross. So it's definitely better to dine in or pick up.  Also, they have a ridiculously large 30\" square pizza that barely fit through the front door!  We've ordered other misc items such as zeppolis and the buffalo chicken salad, which are both delicious.  The pasta was okay, but not exceptional, but it tends to be a better option for delivery. The Strombolis and calzones are  super cheesy and don't seem to get soggy like the pizza when delivered.   I've ordered via phone and eat24. Usually get put on hold when calling in. And delivery takes a while when delivered both ways. It usually takes then 45min-1hr+ (usually more) to deliver.   Bottom line: I like their food, but it's greasy pizza that can backfire (soggy crust) if you're getting it delivered, which can take 1hr+.",

Ordered a small calzone(pictured & half eaten, it was double its size & to them is considered \"small\" portion.\" Also ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries, a philly cheesesteak & some curly cheese bacon fries. Having eaten their food before i was expecting goodness. Please note that i paid with card on yelp. I was 4 miles from them.. the order took about 50 mins. So delivery guy comes, my fiance answers & hes telling my fiance that he needs to pay cash. Im looking at the reciept that says $47.88. So he asks me what happened.. i double check to see if i messed up & my fiance looks at his card statement online to show proof of purchase & to our surprise we are charged THREE times. NONE of which were the amount on the reciept at the door. We expected the bill to be $1 more than yelp said due to sauce charge. We didn't know they would charge us 3 times then argue when his restaurant under charged me TWO CENTS. They charged me 3 times.. each bill was $46-$47 EACH. The delivery guy wanted to say that none of the amounts were right because the last charge was $47.86 (which was the highest charge) I was upset & said \"If you would like the 2 cents i willl gladly get it for you\" & he declined, asking for a signature. Needless to say BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.   But on a lighter note :) my bacon cheeseburger was AMAZING! Not dry, or soggy like most i order! The curly bacon cheese fries were gross. They tasted stale and undercooked. The calzone was amazing! & huge. When i saw the pizza box, i thought he had the wrong order. & i was told the philly was really good! So work on the customer service a little & we'll return!",

If you don't know their pizza, I would highly recommend you to try it. I didn't try other food, so my recommendation is for their pizza :)",

    "text": "Love getting their take out special of 1 topping pizza at about $8. Also love their wings here. Everything we've had was usually take out. They're always polite over the phone and they have our number saved I guess because they have our name when we call. They let you know how long the food will take so you can pick it up. It's always fresh and hot when we get it. I see where the complaints come from because they get pretty busy on the weekends. Sometimes they say the wait for one pizza is 30 minutes. Anyway, we finally decided to eat at the place instead of taking out. We ordered 40 wings and the 30 inch pizza. They let you do different sauces for the wings and you can have different toppings for each quarter of the pizza. The wings here are huge and meaty! I love the honey BBQ. The pizza came out and it was HUGE!! We thought it would be fun having this giant pizza. There were 7 of us and we didn't get through half of the pizza and still had about 10 wings. I like the pizza here, they're never skimpy on toppings and it's always super cheesy. Our server for the night was a very nice guy who was always checking on us, constantly refilling our drinks, and bringing us more ranch lol it was a fun and great experience. It was really cheap too!",

    "text": "Both the person who took our order and the person who delivered our order were very personable and pleasant...  HOWEVER!  It took them an hour and a half to deliver...okay, finally we can eat! ...um, no.  First we tried the pizza  - it was really bad! The crust tasted like saltine crackers, flavorless. In addition, there was very little, if any, tomato sauce! It was greasy, and without the sauce had the feeling of rubber. In addition, it was cold. An altogether terrible experience.  Then we got to the Antipasto - the balsamic vinegar dressing tasted bad, and mostly it was sliced luncheon meat, not the salami, pepperoni and prosciutto we were expecting. In addition, there was barely any lettuce or vegetables, no garbanzo beans, olives or any of the things one would expect of a True Antipasto.  They need lessons in basic Italian cooking. They might be good at the non-Italian items, I don't know, but after we ate what little we managed to force down we both felt like we had swallowed a cement block.  If any of the people who own this establishment are reading, put some real ingredients in your crust. Add about 4 times the amount of tomato sauce to the pizza topping. Put Italian meats and lettuce, garbanzos and fresh dressings to your Antipasto.  You've got customer relations pretty down. Now get the food to those standards and you just might have a restaurant.",

He sped across the parking lot and parked blocking the entrance to our business.   I asked what took so long and he snapped \"we're busy.\" He told me the food had just come out of the kitchen after the other guy in the phone had already told me the order was sitting there 40 minutes earlier.   The sandwiches and fries were cold and soggy. Gross.   I understand you thrive on drunk tourists rather than repeat customers. I get that you are busy now because it is tourist season. So maybe you don't care that your service sucks and your food does too. Maybe you don't care your driver is rude and I won't order again. .... But keep it up. Keep providing lousy service to locals and wait for winter. Tourist season doesn't last forever!!",

    "text": "I knew I had heard this name before & I probably looked it up last year & said no way, but I was starving & there's no places for delivery in this city if you are in this area.  First of all this place is NOT owned by Italians, they are either Russian or Ukrainian or something.  I ordered the following:  1. Veal Marsala - no taste, they don't know they are doing, it was tough & at $17.99, a rip off.  2. They have no beef ravioli, so I had to order the pastrami sandwich which I read had 1000 Island dressing on it. I got French on mine instead (what?) I haven't tried it yet, although I tried to take a bite & it was mostly all bread as it was like thick sub bread.  3. I asked for lemons with my salad, I got none so I can't eat it.  4. I asked for angel hair pasta as my pasta side & I got NO SAUCE. They just poured oil & probably threw a bit of garlic salt on top. It was like eating plain pasta.  5. I asked if their tomatoes were ripe so I could get the salad caprese & they said no, the girl didn't even know what the word ripe meant. I had to ask 3 times & even the guy, who I assume is the owner, said no, they aren't ripe, they are fresh.   What does that mean? LOL Ripe IS fresh.   Forget it, they don't even understand English & for a restaurant to admit their produce isn't ripe is (well fill in the blank)  6. I was told $3.50 for delivery, he tried to charge me $4.50 when I called back. While he gave it to me for $3.50, I shouldn't have had to insist.  7. I was charged $1 for using my credit card which is illegal to do, but they all do it here in Vegas.  8. While they weren't mean or anything, they weren't outright friendly either.  I lost $40 (that includes tip) for the 2 items above & the tiramisu (I haven't tried it yet). It probably  isn't real tiramisu.",

We've ordered delivery from this place twice so far and have picked up carryout a few times afterwards.  The first time we ordered delivery we got the 18\" large Supreme pizza. The pizza was huge. The toppings were generous. The crust was the right mix of chewy and crispy. The next time we ordered we ended up getting a smaller size pizza and a combo platter. The combo platter comes with mozzarella sticks, fried mushrooms, zucchini sticks, jalapeno poppers, and onion rings. The pizza was consistent to the good quality of the first time we ordered. The combo platter was hot when it arrived. Everything was tasty but I wasn't a fan of the zucchini sticks.   This restaurant is great. It has become our new regular pizza spot.",

You can eat there, pick up, or have it delivered! I come here a lot since it's across the street from my work. It's in the parking lot on Sahara and Decatur next to Dotty's! They have an awesome set up inside. I love how spacious it is and how you're not super cramped in there. It's nice and bright in there so it puts you in a good mood just walking in. They have a wide selection of food. You can get anything from a cheese steak (chicken and beef), ham and cheese sandwiches, fried calamari sticks, salads, soup, meatball subs, burgers, wings, and even pasta. And obviously pizza!! THEY HAVE A GLUTEN FREE MENU AS WELL. As if they didn't have enough options. It's so cool to me! Also a kids menu.   For me, a pizza isn't good unless you can pick it up and it sags over. You get that here. It's really delicious. It is greasy, but if you don't like greasy pizza, it's hard enough to trust you. I can't stand that deep dish thing people do. That's pie. Not a pizza. This is real pizza. Here if you pickup a one topping 16 inch pizza for only 8.99.. It's literally cheaper than getting a small. Might as well get a 16 inch!!! It's for all 3 locations as well.   The desserts alone kill me every time. Nutella cheesecake, baklava, tiramisu, rice pudding, and more! I am always scared of trying baklava any where else because mother makes it best. It tasted just like my moms though and I was sooo happy!! Nutella or caramel cheesecake is straight up my favorite though.   The burgers are too big to even fit in my mouth. You can pick from half a pound or a full pound. And it's real meat! Large selection of burgers. I finally tried it earlier today and I was so pleased with it. It comes with fries but you can substitute it for onion rings and more. The 1000 island burger is really delicious!   Amazing food, amazing service, huge portions, great prices. I will always recommend this place and I respect the owner/workers here so much!!",

Almost like our food was left out while waiting on my friends fries because it was the only thing between our two plates that was hot, I proceeded to go back inside to buy a side of fries because I'm still hungry and it's the only thing that looks ok, nobody cared my food sucked and ultimately we both threw our food away and wasted 30$",

We ordered our food around 7:40. The expected delivery time was 8:39. That's still a considerably long time for delivery, but we like Napoli's. Furthermore, you would think that a delivery from Sahara and Decatur to Rainbow and Charleston wouldn't take long. Not the case here. Instead our food arrived at 9:22. The delivery guy tossed our pizza, and the box containing the chicken fingers with so much force it slid on the counter. The food was good as always but our pizza and chicken fingers were cold. I doubt I'll eat or order from this location again.",

Two nights ago my fiance and i went to eat, we ordered at exactly 9:01 pm, didn't get our pizza or garlic knots until 9:47.. the people sitting next to us who got there the same time as us waited, got their food, and ate before we even got our food... it was busy in there which I get but no one even gave us the time of day. We also always pay for the big side of ranch and EVERY time they don't give it to us.. so after our frustration of waiting so long and going to someone for our order, we left (after wanting to eat there) we got into the car and of course per usual our ranch wasn't there.. so he went back in to get the ranch and the same girl who took our order asked for his receipt but she was the one who took our order.. and the other girl took our receipt when she went to grab our very late order.. needless to say, we will be driving out of our way to the Henderson one because this location is ridiculous and incompetent.",

We try to order with postmates with free deliver and they try to charge us a $7 service fee!!?! We call the order in and when it arrived the pizza was completely smashed onto the the lid of the box. The entire pizza topping and cheese was all stuck and we had to peel it off (what we could it was really smashed in there). The sandwiches we all ordered were so over cooked we couldn't tell what was chicken from the rest. My chicken parm sandwich had little pieces of over cooked dried out hard crunchy of what I think was the chicken. There wasn't much and it was smothered in sauce and cheese. Basically a marinara and cheese sandwich with crunchy bits. The bread was so hard. We've ordered pizza from here before and it was good. Never sandwiches. Save your money. Not worth it.",

The salad had huge chunks of iceberg lettuce and soggy tomatoes. The garlic bread was ok.  Chicken Parm was delicious!(only reason why they get 2 stars)  Took way too long to order and could barely understand the gentleman taking my order and had to keep repeating things back to him as well as me saying \"I'm sorry what did you just say?\" About 9 times in 15 mins...  Make sure you check your order when you get a delivery as they forget things and then don't make up for the inconvenience.   Definitely need to work on their customer service and quality of food to stay open in my professiinal opinion.",

I called & spoke to 2 different managers who argued with me & made me out to be a liar saying that the camera showed I was given 6 wings & fresh veggies.... All I was offered was a $2.00 refund or to have 2 wings & fresh veggies delivered to me.  Really??? So I have to wait delivery for 2 pieces of chicken while my pizza gets cold??? This is unfair!!

    "text": "Napoli's is def one of the best pizza spots in Vegas!  Besides the pizza being amazing, the wings and chicken fingers are really good too!   As for the pasta I wouldn't vouch for it. My sister tried the fettuccini Alfredo, and I felt it was flavorless. The chicken that goes with the pasta is just as flavorless and has an odd look to it. It's clearly frozen and looks like it was put in the microwave to defrost than thrown on the pasta. Def didn't like it, but not every restaurant can perfect every entree.   Now, lets discuss pizza! Their Southwestern Chicken Pizza is hands down my favorite! Its like having nachos but on a pizza! I know the nachos vision on pizza doesn't sound great but I can assure you, it's great! It has so much flavor to it - guaranteed to fall in love with every flavorful bite! Their pizza comes with a nice, thick, crunchy crust which makes the bite 10x more enjoyable! If a pizza with a lot of toppings is this great, I'm sure any other pizza they offer is just as good!   The wings and chicken fingers are really good here! On the wings if you request them crunchy/extra cooking they'll have a real good crunch to them! Not many places are willing to cook a chicken wing for an extra minute, but Napolis doesn't mind it. They're all about the customer experience, or so it seems! I have yet to have a bad experience with the restaurant.   If you're someone that enjoys spicy food be sure to try their \"Hot\" flavored chicken fingers! They're dipping in a buffalo sauce with chili peppers, super spicy! I def can't handle all that heat but I still have one just to satisfy the spicy craving.   Hope everyone has a satisfying experience as I've had every time I order from Napolis.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.   We went here for lunch yesterday, and there are so many mon-fri lunch specials for $7.99 (entree & drink). One of our friends is a regular here, as her day job is around the corner.  It was nice outside so we opted for al fresco dining. One of our friends got a calzone, the other got the blackened chicken salad (came with garlic bread), my husband got the philly (came with fries), and I got the ravioli (came with garlic bread). I really liked the pasta- was good size, cheesy, and al dente, I don't get that too much, because we really don't go to Italian restaurants much, except for maybe, Buca Di Beppo or Strings. Our friend says she's tried many of their menu items because her coworkers order from here all the time.    I didn't know what to order, because there were so many lunch special choices. After seeing what we all got (and everyone liked it too), I want to try some other things on the menu. Free refills on the drinks, too.  The staff was all very nice. Service was quick. As we were sitting out there, noticed four delivery men walking back to the restaurant. It's a busy place for lunch; it's obvious there is a ton of repeat business. Inside ambiance is very nice. Red checkered table cloths, and looks very Italian-restaurant themed, too. Bathroom is inside as well.    I want to try more! I'm sure we'll be back again.",

If you need a lot of pizza for a good price, this is definitely a place you should try.  Not to mention, their delivery zones seem very vast as far as restaurants go.",

For $11.99 You would think that they would check their avocados to make sure that they are not rotten or not ripe. I usually get this sale because it's filling and very delicious. But the last few times I have gotten this salad it has been sub par. Bad avocados and barely any shrimp. To Victor if you read my review and read the picture, it says \"I HAD TO CUT THE SHRIMP TO MAKE IT BE MORE\" Also I did not receive half an avocado as you claim!!! If you look at the picture I received maybe 3 small slices that were rotten. I took the salad apart and that was the only avocado in there. This isn't the first time I have ordered this salad and it isn't the first time I have received it with rotten avocado!!!!!!! If I could I would not give any stars at all!!!!!! Never ordering from you again!!!!",

    "text": "to whom it may concerned.. first of all thank you to the lady with the blond hair \"ana\" she offer us amazing service great food, in my opinion the best pizza in las vegas. excellent food great amazing taste. but the only bad thing this place has is the service they are rude dont smile no interest in what we want or need . our waitress  sucked ass, sorry for my words. we waited at least 15 min before some one help us. the only person working and doing her job was this short lady with blond hairby the name of ana she is the only one doing her job(good job ana). she is very nice and helpful, she was not even our waitress but she help us more than anybody in the restuarant did. i still love this place because the food. if u guys would get rid of the waitresses there \"\"\"besides\"\" the lady with the blonde hair (ana) because she is very nice and she always treats us good... this place would be more than amazing. food is amazingly perfect but the staff service (waitresses ) with black hair they don't belong there they made me feel unwelcome and this is not the  first time. but anyways hope u can fix this problem  because u might end up loosing a lot of clientele because of the rude bad unwelcome service giving by this ladies, besides that thank you napoli pizza and thank you ana. for doing a great job.",

The pizza is solid, the wings are good, the fried ravioli should be avoided as it is prefrozen. They have a pretty awesome selection of salads though, as silly as that sounds, and their broccoli cheese soup was pretty good.   All in all, good late night drunk meal, I wouldn't rave about it, but I go here fairly often so something's gotta be good lol.",

Huge ass pizza barely fit through the door when the guy was trying to deliver it. Their wings are bomb! They are fat and juicy. Steroid wings! haha. Will definitely try them again.",

    "text": "This place is fine. We ordered the pick up special which is a good value. The menu is a little steep. I think the place is run by Chechnyans so some Americans might interpret their matter-of-fact attitudes as being rude. It only means you get an honest pizza.  If you want a genuine pizza and not a corporate pie, try the take out special.   Delivery service for any pizza place has too many variables. Busy, lame unreliable drivers, traffic, other deliveries fouling things up. I never review a place based on delivery. One day you get it in 20, another day the same thing in 80. Restaurants can't control delivery like Americans expect.   If you speak directly and tell them you problem without tiptoeing and being a kitten, Chechnyans will respect you and do what it takes to resolve the problem.",

    "text": "I tried this place last night for delivery, and all in all it was not a great experience. Besides the food being mediocre, their customer service could really use some work. The woman who took my order over the phone was not helpful, difficult to understand as well as having a hard time understanding me, and to be honest she was kind of rude. We ordered a Chicken Parm sub and a Chicken Cacciatore dinner. She said our order wouldn't be here for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, which is absurd since their menu states \"fast delivery.\" We almost cancelled but decided to give them a try anyway. Well the delivery man had the most difficult time EVER finding my apartment, I understand that complexes can be confusing, but he called me multiple times and I kept telling him to just go back to the front and I would direct him to my apartment but he like refused to do that, I don't know if he couldn't understand me or what, he was difficult to understand as well. I put it on speaker and my boyfriend thought he heard him tell me to come meet him at the leasing office, lol. I'm pretty sure the whole point of paying extra for delivery is to have the food come to me. Anyway! When he finally arrived I handed him a tip and he didn't say thank you and told me he needed my credit card and ID, but I had already payed the woman with my card over the phone. So I got it and he took an IMPRINT of my card which is totally not ok! Anyway, our bill was much more than expected because we must have an old menu or something, the prices we were charged were way higher than the prices on the delivery menu. Boyfriend said his sub was ok, but I tried his fries and they were horrible, rubbery and we didn't even eat all of them. My chicken was pretty good although it was basically just chicken in a pool of marinara with pretty much NO veggies at all. Pasta was decent and garlic bread was horrible. I definitely don't think we'll be ordering from here again.",

I specifically and politely requested extra sauce, well done and lots of extra parmesan and cheese. I was told it would be an hour and a half for the delivery and they were right on time and I understood. When the pizza arrives it looks like it had been prepared by my grandkids. The crust was white and doughy, there was almost no sauce on it, it appears that the driver put it on his passenger seat and two-thirds of the pizza had slid to one side of the box. And I receive the cursory three or four packets each of cheese and peppers. Even the guys at the club house couldn't believe how bad this pizza was. I went in Sunday morning to see if I could resolve this and nobody cared.",
