The food speaks for itself great taste great quality but your dining experience relies on the customer service. When your waiter or waitress not only knows you by name but can remember what you like to eat and what appetizers you previously tried that is what going above and beyond stands for. I love the dining experience and atmosphere . Tonight I got to enjoy football great prices and felt like I was fine dining . I truly hope someone recognizes when your staff goes above and beyond excellence to ensure the customers are given a great dining experience . From the attentiveness to the hot meal you created this place feels like home. Just an fyi I did read a previous statement by a customers complaining about Taylor and I beg to differ.. If the staff asks if you have been there before it's because they want to ensure that your experience will be a memorable one. When your waiter asks if everything is alright or do you enjoy the food it's because they really want your opinion to make sure you are enjoying what you are paying for . Seems to me like this girl should have stayed home . Overall u get your money's worth your kids are entertained with the games a great place to take your family for a healty dinner .. Please ask for Taylor to serve you she will bring a smile to your face",

    "text": "I have been to Genghis Grill a few times already and I really like this place, I always tell my friends about it too. This place is good, but it should be great. The concept is easy.. You build your own bowl with your choice of protein, veggies, sauce/seasonings and starches. My bowls always taste really good so as far as that it's perfect. What I'm not 100% on is the service. The staff is always very nice, but I feel like I am being suffocated by them. When you are first seated you wait for your server to come and I feel like they just talk sooo much and explain what I already know, this bugs since they ask if you know how the build your own bowl works. I feel they need more choices for appetizers, specially since they have 120 drink choices. The food line always looks like a mess.. I understand it's self serve, but that's why it should be kept cleaner. There's plenty of ingredient choices so every time you go there you can make a totally different bowl. Once you complete your bowl it only takes a few minutes for it to be cooked. I like that they are done quick, I just don't like that the bowls are not brought out together. I hate eating before everyone has their food and I had to wait a couple of minutes before I could have a bite since we were missing one bowl. I do believe all the plates should be brought out together. On this last visit out service visited our table about 4 times.. I feel that's a bit much since she wasn't removing anything from our table or filling up drinks (self serve as well). I will keep recommending this place to everyone because the food really is great, you'll enjoy your creation. As far as everything else, there really will be flaws.",

My only complaint is the last time we went (and perhaps it was just that time) there was no music, no volume on the TVs, nothing to help drown out your neighbors' annoying conversations. If it's crowded enough, I suppose this could slide since everybody would just drown out everyone else. However, when it's quiet it's  hard to ignore that really loud person three tables away who feels his/her life is so fascinating that the whole world must hear about it! Or, maybe they're deaf in one ear. In any case, if Ghenghis Grill turned on some music, talk show radio, ANYTHING I think it would help with the ambience, and the unintentional eavesdropping.  Otherwise, food is great, service is good, restaurant is clean, and I'd definitely return (with headphones, just in case).",

They give you so many meats, sauces, seasonings and vegetables to choose from you'll never run out of creative ways to make your bowl. Plus for the lazy person, they have bowls already created so you don't have to decide if choice is hard for ya lol. The biggest drawback is PRICE!! Average $10 for a bowl. The scary part is you can pile up so much ingredients and have it overflowing with goodness and BOOM!! When its cooked your bowl has shrunk lol. I was like what the hell? Did they drop half my food on the floor? Especially for the money. If your craving Mongolian, you can find better deals elsewhere. At the Fiesta Henderson Buffet, they have a mongolian section and you can customize your plate anyway you want for half the price and as the Fat Boys Song says, \"All You Can\" Eat!!\" Until next time, Let's Eat!!!",

It took 10 mins to go through the item line.  Then another 25 mins to wait for the food to be cooked.   Food: The bowl is way too small.  You can seriously only get like 5 pieces of meat and a scoop of one vegetable and then your bowl is completely full.  Come on now, it's an endless all you can eat, so why not give us bigger bowls so we can actually put in everything we want.  The sauce are all presented as American barbecue sauces, thick.  The real asian sauces are thin and taste better.  But I'm a Mongolian BBQ snob.   Bottom Line: Good choices of meats and vegetables.  The super tiny bowl was not helpful, and the super long lines made the endless bowl an endless wait.  A food experience, but I don't know if I have that kind of time to just sit and wait.  At $13.99 for an endless bowl, it's almost double what you would pay in California.",

You get to make it how you like it and with so many options for meats, veggies, spices, and sauces, if it taste bad than you probably picked the wrong combinations.  Ive been twice in the last week and look forward to eating here again.  For $10 I got more than I could eat and took the rest home.  Yeah you can pay a few bucks more for all you can eat, but if you pack as much into your first bowl you probably won't need any more.  I love spicy food, so I made a bowl of seasoned beef, chicken, brocoli, lots of jalepenos, peppers, garlic and used 2 different sauces and it was amazing.  My wife and kid love this place as well.  I definetly would suggest giving this place a try.  The servers have also been very polite and the atmosphere is exactly what I would expect which is a nice cozy place to enjoy a meal.  This is now my 2nd favorite place to eat after (El-Torito Cafe)!!!",

I went there on two different occasions to buy gift cards for birthdays. I finally decided to go with friends. I've only been to one other Mongolian grill place so there isn't a lot to compare. All that I can say is that the service was mediocre and not terrible. The food was good. I like the concept of making your own meal with ingredients that you like.  My partner didn't follow instructions and put the sauce in his food bowl instead of the side bowl. They made him go back and put more sauce in the side bowl. Ultimately what happened was an inedible bowl. None of us can figure out why they made him add more sauce. It was too much sauce and not good. Three of us; however, enjoyed our meal. I didn't know that this place is a chain. Oh well...I'll go back because I enjoyed it. I'm not sure that my partner will though. The idea of the sauce makes him queasy,",

We sat there with not so much as a greeting until the same hostess that seated us had to ask if anyone was helping us.  Finally our server \"Twila\" finally came and told us that she would be with us.  No sorry for the wait, just sort of it's busy, I'll get to you.  Then she came and then when it came time to explain how the place runs and how to get your food she basically said that she wanted to wait until the other table was ready so that she could take us in a group.  Yep, that's why I came out with my family, to make this a group event!  She must have noticed the looks on our faces because she suddenly changed her mind and said well I can just take you now.  Soon after we started eating our food, she came back and dropped off surveys and asked us to fill them out.  Could we have waited until after we ate to do this?  She then came back 10 minutes later and asked if we were going to fill out the surveys or if she should just take them back. Wow this place gives you mandatory homework with your food!    The food itself was just ok.  I have eaten at some much better Mongolian BBQ places but unfortunately they are out of town so my hopes were high for this place.  The sauces were a bit too sweet and thick.  The noodles were a bit undercooked.    At the end of the day the mediocre food is not worth the terrible service.",

But after the so-so experience I don't think that were rushing back anytime soon.  Staff was great - we were seated and explained the process since we were 1st timers - we then followed her to the buffet line where you pick your own ingredients - so if it doesn't taste good - that's your own fault.  They have a menu board and the ingredients that go into it - but you have to make it yourself.  I tried to follow along - but got lost and just started adding what I thought went into it.  I would suggest piling up your bowl with your favorites and don't go too heavy on the sauce.  I didn't pile on enough so when my bowl came it was very sad looking - and tasted just OK.  We also ordered pot stickers which I would not recommend.  Tasted like it was frozen and just heated up, and the sauce was like it was from a bottle.  I would say it is FUN to experience this at least once - but don't set you expectation too high.  Remember - if it doesn't taste absolutely delicious - that is no ones fault but your own as  you chose the ingredients.",

Walking in, I didn't know it was anything like it was. First, you're seated and your server explains how it all works, they take your drink order, explain and offer some appetizers and then asks what size bowl you'd like..small, medium or large. Once you pick your bowl size, you then go up to the bar/buffet area where you put choices together. Pick from multiple different raw proteins and veggies...fill and pack that bowl with as much as you possibly can...pick your seasonings and then your sauces. Then, take your creation to the grill, pick your starch and give it to the cooks to put it all together and cook it all up for you. You can watch your creation come together or take a seat and your server will bring it to you. Our server today was Kelly and she was absolutely amazing. She explained it all perfectly and answered all of our questions. She even came up to the food line with us to make sure we knew what to do and to make sure we were 100% comfortable with what to do. We ordered the pork pot sticker appitizer which was amazing and my friend and I both loved the bowls that we created. I went with a chicken dish and her with a beef. I can't wait to go again and put some other stuff together. They have so many selections and concoctions that can be made..it's going to be an amazing adventure every time. I would recommend that everyone try this place at least once. You will not be disappointed!!",

    "text": "I've been to this place in Phoenix and I was super psyched when one opened in Las Vegas! I'm glad it's here but it's not my favorite. I eat here about twice a month anyway because it's an easy way to get your veggies and it's cheap.  You go in, sit down, order your drink and get a bowl. Then you belly up to the bar and fix your own bowl. Drop it at the grill and your server delivers it to your table when it is ready.   THE BAD:  The bar is usually dirty which freaks me out. I know it's hard to keep the place clean but geez, sometimes it is downright nasty. The cooks also NEVER cook my bowls enough. I ask for it super well done / almost blackened and every single time my shrimp comes out opaque and I have to tell 'em to cook it more. I also experience tummy issues an hour or so after eating here...maybe from all the fiber? I don't know.   Another thing I really hate is that EVERY SINGLE TIME I have eaten here, the server has felt the need to comment on how many bowls I've eaten. We've had probably 8 different waiters and they all say something about it. I'm not fat (and there's nothing wrong with being chunky) but I can eat, and it makes me really uncomfortable when people feel like they have to say things like \"wow, this is your THIRD BOWL?\" Maybe corporate teaches them to do that so they will shame you into not getting another plate of shrimp. (And by the way, my bowls are usually 100% veggies; I don't like that meat that swims in its own...juices on the bar)!   THE GOOD:  You can pile on all the meat and veggies you want. It's fun to play chef and create a bowl with all the different dry spices and wet sauces. I usually pay the additional $3 to add on the all-you-can-eat bowl because it makes it easier to experiment. If you don't like the first bowl, make another.   The iced tea is freshly brewed and really good, and they have Coke Zero. I also love that there are lots of protein choices (marinated steak, chicken breast, shrimp, turkey, and more) and you can choose a starch (tortillas, noodles, rice) or just have none at all (I usually have no starch).   It's an easy place to get full for under $30 for two. I've noticed the crowds have died down significantly since the place opened. It used to be packed and you had to wait to eat but now you can walk in pretty much any time of the day. A decent place to go and one that I'll continue to visit.",

First time there was on a Sunday and the place was extremely packed and it took forever for the food to come out. Went in to dine there but because of the long wait got it to go instead and the waitress made a price change on bill which ended up being lesser than what it should have been due to wait. That was appreciated. The food was great when I got home to eat it so I went back the next day when it was not as busy and ate there and was completely satisfied with the food and service! Great place for healthy fresh food.",

They have a good variety of proteins and most come marinated or seasoned. They also have a ton of seaonings, sauces and veggies to put in. I always try to fit the most I can in my regular sized bowl and when it comes to my table I can't even finish it all so basically 2 meals from my regular size bowl. And like I said, how good the bowl comes depends all on your choice of ingredients. They also have new drink choices and I got the pineapple mint fresca and it really was refreshing and wowed me because I wasn't expecting it to be so good.",

    "text": "So, I must admit...I've never been to any other Mongolian grill. I know, shame on me. What kind of Yelper am I?! Even so, from what I've heard and read...this isn't the place to go for a Mongolian grill experience. I've been here a handful of times and it just seems to get worse every single time.  For the most part everyone who's been here or somewhere similar, you know how it works. But I was here this past weekend and watched 4 different tables get seated without anyone asking if they'd been there before or know what to do. Customers just stand there confused until someone comes back and for the restaurant, that's ridiculous. Sure, it's not hard to figure out but if you've never been anywhere like it, I imagine that's a frustrating experience. I hate their customer service for many other reasons so maybe my opinion is a little biased, but they definitely need to train the employees better. They don't explain anything to anyone, including the fact they you need to go get your own drink.   When it comes to the food, it's fun being able to pick your own stuff and make your own creations but like others have mentioned, they are always out of stuff. Then when it's busy and only one line is open, the whole entire experience just goes out the window because it feels so rushed. Also, I'm not sure if it's a health reason or what...but why is all the stuff so far away from the counter? I have to bend down and reach under that tiny area to get to items in the back. It's all just very annoying to me. The food is okay but I think they overcook everything, again, maybe for health reasons? The meats themselves always seem to be dry and chewy. If you get egg, it's almost like a fried egg that someone forgot to pull off the stove. There's just nothing spectacular.  I think it'll be a while before I go back. The service is crap, the food is mediocre at best and it's expensive. For 3 adults and kid to eat, it cost about $50 without the \"all you can eat\". When it comes down to it, I just don't see this experience or food being worth that much!",

You pick a size bowl and then they give you a bowl to pile your stuff in according to your selection. PRICES went up people!! $9 for small $12 for medium and $16 for a large.   Udon noodles are delicious and the honey teriyaki is the sauce to go with!! WARNING...if youchoose to put calamari in your bowl...once the food is cooked and all is said and done it is very chewy because it was over cooked on the grill. So make sure you don't use that as a main meat source.  I love the coke machine. I can try various selections that I have never had much less never even heard of. Raspberry coke, interesting but delicious.  They did ask if I wanted a to go  box and they gave my daughter a to go box. So maybe the price jack included the to go box because before you couldn't take anything home unless you purchased the bottomless bowl which was damn near $20.  All in all a great place with great food....but bring a jacket because it is always and I mean always freezing!!",

We chose our size bowl, piled on veggies and meat and chose what sauce we wanted, and there's quite a few choices for each section, thats nice. Bring it to the cooks and asked if we wanted an egg and either rice, noodles, or half and half. The noodles weren't like regular mongolian noodles you usually get from these types of places, they were like udon noodles, i think, which was weird to me. They cook it and then the waiter brings it to your table. It was not bad, but also not great. It was hella pricey though. For a medium bowl it was like 10-11$ for dinner. I never pay that much for mongolian noodles esp for that amount of food. The waitress we had was super nice and always checked up on us so the service overall at the place was great. It wasn't busy when we went during a weekday, and there's plenty of room, it's quite big actually with large tvs hanging around. Booths or tables available. Would only come back if i was really craving some noodles real quick bc it's nearby.",

Thats why i prefer getting my own drink not to mention making up for own bowl. Yes this is a bit of wait time but you have to keep in mind that if ther are other people infront of you,your going to have to wait your turn. Other then that your getting it fresh off the grill. You have a vast varieties of meats veggies sauces spices so you can mix it up every one in awhile i see nothing wrong with that. This place is great i do recommend this place.

It's a like scary the first time you go because you have no one to blame but yourself if you don't like your food considering your the one who adds all your contents from meat, veggies, spices, and sauces. You then let the chefs know what starch you want and they give you a number to put at your table. It's cooked pretty quickly and brought to you. It's a different experience that I think was enjoyable for the whole family.",

    "text": "We were shopping across the street when we got a big whiff. A strong smell of onions and meat came wafting down to entice us in to have some mongolian bbq for the first time. We followed our noses and went and got seated in this busy place. That is surely a good sign. WRONG!   The server asked us if we had been there before to which we both answered \"no\". She handed us our menus and really tried her hardest to explain how the operation went down, but she was a little tongue tied. Can't fault her for it. Who knows how many times a day she has to repeat the process to newbies like us. So she tells us how it works as we peruse the menu.   Most of the menu is quite unnecessary as we went and got everything for ourselves anyway. Why was there a section that displayed drinks when we had to go and get drinks for ourselves in one of those newer Coca Cola machines where there seems to be a millon different selections? That is the only good thing about that place unfortunately. The only thing the menu really should be is an appetizers menu. There were about 3 extra pages that could have been eliminated.   After ordering some chicken potstickers we were on our way. We went up with our bowls and got in line to pick our ingredients. Some of it looked suspicious. I thought it would be rude to put my head in and sniff for myself if the seafood or chicken went bad. I tried to play it safe and went with beef. I added a multitude of spices, garlic, salt, pepper, etc. to my mix. I was anticipating good things because the smells that were all around were promising. We got up to the place where they take our raw bowl and cook it for us. I decided on the spiral pasta. We got some drinks and sat down. I understand there were others ahead of us in line. I understand it was busy. I understand that Sunday nights are not the best time to get speedy service. This was taking forever! My boyfriend got his food first. It smelled good, but it seemed to be \"barely\" cooked all the way. He is not one to complain so he ate it anyway. My food came about 15 minutes AFTER his. Even though I was right behind him in line. My food was also barely cooked. The pasta was very bland. Even though I filled my little 'cup' of stir fry sauce up to the top it was not enough. Most of my food tasted like plain noodles with hits of flavor every now and again. Immediately after eating I felt sick. I know it was the meat. We were never checked on. I had to track down our server to find out about our potstickers that never came. She acted surprised. She asked us if we still wanted them. I said yes. I wouldn't have ordered something I don't want. It was a mistake. I should have said no. They came out rushed. She must have forgot to put the order in and was rushing the cooks. The skin was not fully cooked and was like uncooked pasta. Crunchy. Blech!!! Never again. No apology about the late appetizers. Just dumped it on the table and left. Not happening. We learned our lesson. We should have read the Yelp reviews before wasting our time and money (and my squeamishness) .",

Even heated up the food is amazing the next day. The wait is never too long. I went one time when it was busy and it took them maybe 10-15 minutes, which is amazing considering there was no more space to drop your food off to have it cooked!

The hostess will seat you and then a server stops by to give you a card that you'll take through the line. The first thing you'll choose in the line is the size of the bowl. I always choose the smallest because you'll add stuff at the end that will make the portion larger than it seems. The first section of food is all meat and seafood. Next up is vegetables and seasonings. The final section contains a variety of sauces. Lastly, you'll take it to the grill area where you can add options like eggs, fried rice, udon noodles, or pasta to name a few. While you wait you grab your drink and head back to the table to wait for the server to bring your food.  What do I love about it? You can create a variety of flavors and themes when choosing your meal. The meats, sauces, seasonings, and vegetables can be changed up on every visit to create completely different meals. One visit could be sweet-n-sour chicken and another visit could be a seafood dish with curry seasoning. The bowls come up pretty quickly so it's a nice cross between fast food and full service dining. The cost of the bowl is reasonable for the amount of food and a low cost option for a quick lunch or dinner. They also have a reward card to get a bowl free after 10 purchases.",

    "text": "I consider this a lunch spot, I don't think I would come here for dinner.  I also wouldn't ever pay full price to eat at Genghis Grill.  If you plan on eating here, I suggest signing up for their club to get your free regular size birthday bowl and other coupons via email, plus every 10th bowl free.  This restaurant falls somewhere between fast food and full service.  You are seated by a hostess, but a while back they changed it so you get your own beverages (Coke Freestyle machines), and you go down a buffet style line to pick your bowl ingredients, but you order appetizers and bar drinks from a server.  I really had to get over my fear of going down a buffet line of raw proteins (chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc.).  It scared me because of possible cross contamination, salmonella, temperature, etc.  After coming here on multiple occasions and not getting sick, my anxiety has lessened a bit, but I remain very careful.    Some tips: Make sure you season your meat or your bowl will be bland.  Pile your veggies high because they will cook down.  You can add egg to your bowl when you order your starch.  You can also pick up some toppings (peanuts, sesame seeds, chow mein noodles, and chili paste) while there.",

    "text": "Surprisingly not too shabby! Another Dinner for two under $40 is a win for me and the BF. (Especially when I like to try everything)   This was me and my boyfriends first time here. The waitress will seat you. Around the Restuarant they have bowls to show the sizes you can choose from. Small, medium and large. Your server then brings over the 3 sizes of metal bowls. You then choose your size and explains what you need to do when you choose your meats, veggies and sauces. Our waitress also advised us that we should stack our meats and veggies as high as we can in the bowls.   We chose the medium size bowls. However, I made my decision based on the metal bowls because they looked smaller and thought to myself like girl you're still going to be hungry. Lol. And also thinking that the meat and veggies will shrink, right? But that was why I picked my bowl.   Next you take your bowls to where you pick what you want in your stir fry. For the meats there were a variety of them. Some seasoned and unseasoned Chicken, beef, pork, seafood. After the meats comes the dry seasonings. Anywhere from the usual salt, pepper, garlic to Cheyenne there was quit a few spices. Then you choose your veggies cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, zucchini, broccoli to name a few then lastly you will top all that off with the sauces. They had at least 6 different sauces if I'm not mistaken. Once you choose your sauce, you then take it to the next counter where you can choose your starch which is noodles, white or brown rice. Then they cook your food on this huge round grill. Head to your seat and your waiter brings you your food.  Before I end this, they have a pretty big drink menu and they looked yummy! They do have a bar as well, so you can order a nice little cocktail or beer. And if you don't want that you can grab yourself nice fruity Fresca (we got the raspberry/mandarin Fresca) they have flavored teas or the fountain drink which is that cool coke machine where you can customize your drinks as well. Btw, their non-alcohol drinks like the Fresca is refillable, Yay!   All in all it was good food because you get to pick what you want. The bowls are not too pricey. I will say, I underestimated those metal bowls because after you stack the meats and veggies then add noodles and rice the portions were HUGE for me. So I'll opt for the small next time. And another thing that they failed to mention is to not go crazy with the spices and sauces. Keep it simple because you'll end up with a big ol' salty mess. I learned that from another review and I'm glad I read it because you can easily make this the worst experience if you get a little sauce crazy!",

    "text": "The short of it: I'm not sure I would pay regular price here too often, but I always enjoy my free birthday bowl immensely. And it's gotten better the more I've learned to add enough salt and spices.  This is the only Genghis Grill which I've been to, and other than that, I haven't really had too much so-called Mongolian barbecue aside from mall food courts. The premise is that you can pick your own meats, starch, and flavors and have them cook it on a giant hot metal flattop.  The routine starts as follows: you're seated, a server asks you if you want appetizers or alcohol / bar seating (both of which I've never bothered with), and then you go to the line to choose your food. If you're lucky, there won't be much of a line and you'll get more time to weigh your options. If not, then think on your feet. As others have said, it's your own damn fault if you don't get a flavorful dish.  An employee will ask you if you want a small, medium, or large bowl. I thought I could have eaten a little more after the medium. You get to pick from a variety of proteins, spices and seasonings, and sauces. Definitely load your main bowl at least to the rim with proteins. I would stick to the ones that have recognizable meat texture, which for me were the marinated steak tips, pork, and marinated white fish. The chicken looked unappetizing and there was no way I was using the processed meats. Further down the line are various vegetables that you might also consider adding. I wouldn't add too many aside from mushrooms, onions, and maybe carrots since I'm all about meat.  The next two steps are so important that they get their own paragraph. You need to add spices and seasonings because there won't be enough from the meats, starches, or even the sauces. Use the tiny spoons to get several heaping spoonfuls of different granulated flavorings (such as garlic, ginger, cayenne, and yellow curry). Finally, you'll arrive at the sauces. Use a sampling spoon and try a sauce. If it's not that tasty, get another spoon and sample another sauce. Pick one or two that you like and ladle it into the small sauce bowl. I enjoy the 3G sauce, but you might not.  Finally, walk to the counter near the grill and present your bowl. They'll ask which starch you want. I picked udon noodle, but maybe you'll want rice or something. You can ask for 1 or more eggs to be added to your bowl here. They used to have eggs for you to grab in line, but I'm guessing too many of them dropped and broke. I believe you may be able to ask for a premade combination at the grill counter, but I wouldn't bother with that unless you're very lazy.  Grab a drink and maybe some condiments from the back area after you drop off your bowl to be cooked. They have those fancy Coca Cola machines that dispense seemingly hundreds of flavors from one spout. There's soy sauce, sriracha, and other things. Go back to your seat and wait an employee to present you with your bowl of cooked food. Eat and enjoy.  I will make this point again so that it's very clear. If you didn't add enough spices and whatnot, don't expect too many good things out of the bowl. You can probably still salvage it with the other condiments and some salt and pepper, and then you can berate yourself. It probably took me at least a couple of visits until I learned this lesson, and I'm so glad I did.  If you want a nice hot bowl of some Asian-inspired flavors with plenty of meat and some carbs, this is a good option. You know what flavors you're getting because you're designing the recipe, and that sure bet is probably worth $12 or so on a regular basis for some people.",

It could have been very upsetting but for the most part I was happy with how it was handled. My husband ordered a medium build your own bowl and I ordered a large. Mine arrived first and seemed small but I thought maybe I was over thinking it. But when my husbands arrived and was WAY bigger, I knew there had been a mistake somewhere. We told our waitress, Sandy, and she went to her manager to resolve the issue. We weren't sure what was happening until she came back about five minutes later. She told us she fixed our bill and we were only charged for a small. But the problem was, we wanted a large. The price was never the issue. When we told her she sort of cut us off and said she can't do anything and she will go get her manager. The manager, kelly, came to our table and asked how we would like to resolve it all. She was very polite about it. I asked how much another small bowl would cost because I'm honestly still hungry and the small was gone at this point. She said that the bowl is on them, which was very kind. We never wanted a free meal, just a big one. I think my server misunderstood that. But I'm glad the manager fixed the experience.",

They let you pile up your bowl as high as you want, so go ahead and mash some food down when you're stuffing it.  I was quite impressed with the amount of meats they had.  Chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, ham, turkey.  Big good sized shrimp too by the way.  I can't even remember all the meats.  Most stir-fry places have 3 or 4 meats, this place probably has close to 10.  The next station is seasoning.  There's about 12 options here as well.  I stuck with the cajun spices for the night.  Remember that just a couple of dashes is all you need.  Plenty of vegetables.  Tons of vegetables.  Mini corn, broccali, green beans, spinach, cabbage, pineapple, celery, mushrooms.  Tons of stuff.  Then the sauces.  I was recommended the Szechuan sauce by a friend and it was good.  I don't know what it is exactly....it's like a thin teriyaki sauce? No, that's not right.  I can't describe it.  In any case, it was good.  There was about 10 other sauces: \"stir-fry\" sauce, sweet and sour, teriyaki and more.  Unfortunately for someone who is watching their carbs, every single sauce is thickened up with wheat.  The last station is the \"starches\" which includes a few kinds of rice and a few kinds of noodles.  Tortillas was also an option.  I'm avoiding carbs where I can so I skipped out on this last option.  What really made me happy is that nobody made a big deal or cared about me skipping out on \"filler\" when I was doing the all-you-can-eat option.  With a soda and the all you can eat option, my total for one person before tip was $17.  It's not terribly expensive, but I'm not exactly impressed with the cost.",

    "text": "I'm actually pretty familiar with Genghis Grill during the old days of my Dallas misadventures.  I used to frequent the place quite often, and was sorry to lose it as one of my restaurant choices when I moved to the West coast.  Well, now it's back.  Or here, I guess is the better way to put it.  I've noticed reviews are all over the place for the restaurant, but my experience was good.  We got there before the dinner crowd, so we were seated quickly and ready to be served.  We did the \"Build A Bowl\" option, and for a $10.99 single bowl dinner price, that was more than fair, though the option to go \"unlimited\" is an extra $3.  Basically, there are a number of meats, vegetables, sauces and starches (noodles, rice, tortilla) to chose from.  You can choose how much you want of everything, and pick whatever ingredient options you want.  Because of the options, you can choose a lot of related things, or go for some pretty outlandish mixtures.  But it's on you if things actually go well together or not, so if you make something you don't like or didn't get enough.... Well, you made it, so there you go.  I created a veritable feast of meats, with enough garlic to kill off the cast of \"True Blood\".  You hang out, while they cook everything up on this huge circular grill, and after a few minutes, the meal is yours.  The options seemed to have changed/expanded since my initial Lone Star State visits, but really, all I cared about was my self-made meal.  And that's probably all I'll ever really care about during another return.  Service was pleasant and appreciative.  They also seem very conscientious about being respectful to food allergies.  While I have none, I'm sure someone will appreciate the extra \"Is this okay\" check-in.  Drinks were refilled quickly, the manager came over to chat and ask about our food experience.  And we got out just before they got slammed with customers.  And they do carry out, as long as it's not the \"All You Can Eat\" option.  All in all, I was pretty satisfied to revisit a familiar experience.  I will echo someone else's statement that I hope they open another location on the west side of town, because it's a bit of a drive, but nothing out of control.  Glad for a new food option.  I'll be checking it out again.",

    "text": "I have been to many Mongolian BBQs and have never been to one that I would not re-visit......until now!  When I was greeted at the door (not knowing anything about this particular place) I asked if they cooked on the typical Mongolian BBQ flat grill and I was told no. Then an annoying waitress sat us and explained how it works and then took us to the food section and pointed out the \"protein\", \"veggies\", \"sauces\" and \"starches\". We selected our food from the buffet-style area. The food containers were under a hood but were so low and far back that it was really difficult to get your food. AND, almost 1/2 of the serving utensils were lying down in the food where they could spread germs etc etc.  from people handling them and putting them back. The dish, that my food was served in, had a chip in it the size of a dime. (did not notice right away cause it had food over it) And last but not least.....I could not identify ANY taste that came with it. My mouth felt as though it was sticking together with glue. On each table was a mini-tablet that had video games and a few pages of ads for the food served within the restaurant. Not totally showing the whole spectrum of food but ....? The absolute best thing was that after your food is served, this little tablet called a \"Presto\" has your bill available to you and you can swipe your CC or Debit card at the table and get the hell out of there without any other dis-satisfactions.   Pros: Had a GREAT bowel movement the next day!!",

Already there was no real \"kitchen\" for them to maneuver, and now they don't even serve water...you get it yourself. They were also out of straws on the day I recently went. Really? You're completely out of STRAWS? Not even for the fishbowl drinks you have? That's a mark of poor management not keeping simple necessities like straws in order.   I was sort of in a love affair with Genghis Grill when I first moved here, but really, it is not that good. They have cut so many corners since then that it's not even fun to eat here. I want full baby corns, dammit, not cut up that I can barely taste it or get it on my fork.   I would rather have Panda Express or Pei Wei than this crapola. Pass.",

We went Sunday and once again, we weren't disappointed. Everything was delicious and the staff was friendly. I believe out server's name was Brett ( I apologize if that's wrong) he was very friendly and attentive. I love the fact that you can fill up your bowl with whatever YOU want. So for all the reviewers that complained about how the food tasted, you are the only one to blame. You get to pick everything in your meal all the way down to the sauce. And don't complain about not liking any of the sauces, they provide tasting spoons so u can try them before committing. Genghis Grill is great! Everyone should try it at least once!",

For $10, you get to build your ow Mongolian BBQ bowl.  They give you a silver bowl oand a side cup for your sauce. You first pick your meats: natural chicken breast, pork loin, marinated white fish, pepperoni, ham, turkey breast, sausage,marinated steak, sliced beef, shrimp, scallops, calamari. Then you season your protein with salt, pepper, garlic, ginger, cayenne, etc. Then you top it with your choice of vegetables. I wish there was more room for vegetables, because they shrink when you stir fry them. Then, you select a sauce (all MSG-free.)  The Honey Soy sauce was good.  Then, you bring your bowl to the grill and let them know your choice of: steamed rice, fried rice, brown rice, udon noodles, pasta, flour tortillas.  Drinks are separate. You go to the drink machine and there's a huge selection of flavored soda, etc.  Some of the meat was a little hard, but overall, the flavors were pretty good. And the service was excellent!",

They brought out our food and we asked where the Edamames were and he said...oh...they did not have room to cook them...wtf?    When making our bowls, we asked the staff behind the glass area, about some nutritional information of the sauces...they were clueless and had NO idea how to answer other than NO. I just started here!  They need to be trained better!  We finally asked in the grill area and he showed us a nutritional chart and helped us.   Waiter finally brought us our check, after requesting for him to come back and he had to go find his Manager to use the Birthday Coupon we had.  You should not have to find a Manager in that small of a place!  The Manager must not have control of the restaurants or his staff!  The job seems pretty basic...something is off there!!

    "text": "Hit Genghis few days ago with gf, and three others.  We were planning a \"wild and crazy\" night of bingo at the Sunset Station since the cash ball bonus was calling my name.  We get to the restaurant at 5:30 - place is busy so we opt to eat in the bar area.  Bingo is at 7 so this gives us sufficient time to go a few rounds , at least that's what we thought.  Bartender was attentive with the drinks, we even got lucky since there was an NFL game on so Happy Hour prices on beer.  Sadly, we get up to the food line and its 10 deep since they only have 1  buffet  line open.  we're told the 2nd line will open soon for the \"dinner rush\" - we're standing in line at about 5:45 - when does the rush begin ?  6?  7 ? Since the place is packed at 5:30 here's a crazy idea - open the 2nd line !!!  So we get through round one - only complaint on food - they were low on a few items and my usual complaint about the place - small bowls.  When we gave the bowl to the cook he asked if we wanted the food to go - we told him no.  So time for second round - it's 6:15 - we figure we have a 1/2 hour to get our food, eat then hit bingo.  This time, the line is about 15 deep - still only one line of food available - WTF !!!  I ask the guy re-filling to ingredients  who's the manager of the place, and he points to a guy manning the grill  - i'll share my concerns with him later.  In the meantime the line is moving at a snails pace.  And of course, i'm mid way filling my bowl when they OPEN THE SECOND LINE - thanks, thanks a lot !!   Given time constraints, when they ask if we want it to go, we say yes.  By the time we get our food, we have 15 minute to pay and leave and get to bingo.  While getting our stuff together, i ask the bartender for our bill - put the $$ with 20% tip in the bill folder even though not pleased about the time issue and the BS of only one line.  The manager comes over to ask how everything went - i expressed my disappointment about the one food line - she advises they open the 2nd line when the place gets busy - THE PLACE WAS BUSY WHEN WE WALKED INTO THE RESTAURANT ... nice try ! She then informs us we cannot take the food to go since we got the bottomless bowl. She had to make the smart remark, It's posted in the restaurant - it might be - i didn't see it nor was i looking - THEN WHY HAVE THE COOK ASK IF WE WANT IT TO GO ?  THEY SHOULD ASK IF WE HAVE THE BOTTOMLESS OPTION, THEN ASK ABOUT TO-GO.  If we can't take it to go then bill us for the one bowl option !  Thankfully she agreed, otherwise, i was really going to lose it .  I get the bill folder and pull out the tip.  F U GENGHIS GRILL - YOU'VE LOST MY BUSINESS",

    "text": "Dear Genghis Grill:  Be better. I really want to like you.  This would have been a four- or five-star review if we were just talking about food. But since the restaurant experience is more than that, I cannot overlook the consistently bad, astoundingly unacceptable service here.  I am not under the illusion that being a restaurant server is an easy job, but in the world of food service, waiting tables at a Mongolian restaurant is on the easier side of the industry, And yet probably about 80% of the time when I have been here, there has been some issue with the service.  In most cases, the issue is, people aren't where they're supposed to be, pretty much ever.  I have walked into the restaurant and waited at the podium for ten minutes waiting for someone to seat me. because the hostess was MIA.  I've stood at the empty grill for five minutes waiting for the cook to come back to take my food..  I've sat at the bar for 15 minutes waiting for the bartender to show up so I could order a takeout bowl.  I have sat staring at my cooked bowl sitting on the counter getting cold, counting the number of servers who walked past it.  I can't figure out if they're always understaffed, or just clueless. Nobody does their job.  I have been waiting for years and years for a Mongolian place to open in Vegas, and I'm on the verge of writing it off forever.  This isn't rocket science. There is simply no legitimate excuse for the service to be this bad at a restaurant where the task of serving food is so simple.  I do like the food here but I honestly can't recommend it based on the uniformly terrible service. I can overlook quite a bit in terms of restaurants but everything about the service experience here is just frustrating.  I'll be back once you get your sh** together.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time over the weekend.  It was fun and delicious.  The staff helped us through the process and there were suggestions on how to create specific dishes.  There were a lot of items to choose from for the bowls, from chicken and beef to scallops and pork.  There are also a lot of vegetable selections and at least 10 different sauces to choose from.  They have a huge assortment of soft drinks and a full bar as well.  Additionally they do have a couple appetizer selections to choose from and a limited dessert menu with a cheesecake and brownie selection, among other choices.  I had a small with fried rice and was satisfied.  I wish there had been less rice in the bowl so the veggie meat rice ratio was a little more balanced but overall a great dish.  Others in my party had the large and medium bowls.  Again, despite filling their meat and veggie dish to the brim, I still felt like their noodle to other stuff ratio was a little off balance.  All in all, a good experience and we will be back.",

I love that you are seated at this location first, upon being seated the waiter/waitress will take your drink order and then ask you which size bowl you would like. Small, Medium or Large. I can't imagine eating a large bowl medium does myself good! The magic is in how you pack your bowl, pack that thang (thing) to the top guys! Seriously put your veggies on the bottom and mush the heck out of them, lol build a wall with your meat on the side and like a Lego keep building up! Yes this meal prep is that serious! But let me back up real quick and explain. Upon picking your bowl size you will then get up and walk to a selection of veggies, protein and sauces to dress your meal up just the way you want, spicy, garlicky, sweet or savory the choice is yours. Once you complete your bowl you will be giving another option to add rice or noodles to complete your creation and stir fry it all up!  It cooks wayyyyyy down once fried and this is way I say pack it on and mush it all the way down in the bowl! I love my creations and this fun restaurant. Drink options are the soda machine, fresh juice, wine or an alcoholic beverage! My go to is always a mojito. Bowls run in the price range of $9.00-$15.00",

    "text": "I've only been to a Mongolian Grill once, but this was my first time here. If you're a newbie like I was, the server explains what to do:  1. Choose the size of your bowl  Pile as high as you can -  2. Meats 3. Spices/seasoning 4. Veggies 5. Sauce(s)  6. Then bring your bowl to the grill area (be careful not to spill anything) 7. Wait for your dish to arrive!  It may seem a bit overwhelming at first since there's so many to choose from. But if you know what you typically like, and after sampling the different sauces, your bowl should come out tasty.  Everything was delicious, except my veggies seemed undercooked.  I recommend to mix your bowl before eating since majority of the sauce stays on the bottom, and get 2 sauce containers for a regular sized bowl (3+ for the large bowl).  The price is very very reasonable! The prices are around: Small = $10, Regular = $11.50, Large = $13 The serving size is HUGE!!!! A regular could feed me twice... And I eat a lot.  The service was average though. My party arrived 1hr before they closed (closing hours were earlier from what was noted in Yelp), so the server was in a bit of a hurry & we had to rush our stay. Nonetheless, we still had a good experience.  I'd definitely come back to create a different bowl!",

    "text": "I like the concept but for newcomers like myself it was a little offputting. When you arrive you are seated first and you chose from a small, medium or large bowl. Although the bowls all look tiny they contain quite a lot once it's full.  My word of advice: Don't get greedy! There are plenty of options to choose from whether you want veggies, meats or sauces. They are all relatively fresh and pretty tasty. The only reason why I give them 2 stars is that it becomes waaaay too easy to butcher up your dish if you mix and match too many sauces and meats.  I went there with my buddy and it was both our first time. Both our bowls came out incredibly salty and it was just an explosion of flavor. I put a pinch of the dragon salt, had a few meats that were marinated and a cup of the sauce and I guess that just made my bowl extremely salty. Can't blame anybody because we chose to add the dragon salt and other sauces ourselves, but before we started we told the servers we were first-timers and I wish she mentioned to go easy on the sauces. That would've been very useful.  I would like to try it again next time but it wasn't a very good first experience.",

They were out of Teriyaki sauce which was disappointing but we made due with the Honey Soy. They have way too many syrupy sauces. Not very calorie conscious.   The server was very good.  He was attentive and friendly. He got a good tip.   For improvements, they need to serve the rice on the side so we control how much. I heard they also own BD's Mongolian BBQ. Yes or no, they need to convert to their format of doing it.  We'll be back since for the price it's a nice night out.",

There's plenty of veggie options and sauce options. If you like meat then pile it on. My only dislike about this place is the soda machine is self-serve. And the sun shines through the door & blinds you at lunch.",

After going through the buffet style station, you bring your bowl to the cooks and  they get the show on the road. Our lunch was done and on our table in about 7-8 minutes.  My only complaints aren't that serious but still bothered me none the less...  1- It was bitterly cold in there! I was literally shivering as I tried to eat lunch. I'm not one to get cold so for me to be FREEZING.. the AC was definitely on too high.   2- While going along the line making our bowls, there were three rows of random ingredients. I couldn't reach the back row! My husband had to reach anything I wanted for me. The woman behind me had the same problem. Not everyone has gorilla arms! Cater to everyone please! Buy longer spoons!   Outside of that, everything was great. Our server \"Sasha\" was very informative and was knowledgeable. She answered all the questions we had about sauces and food allergies.  Will be back again soon! Yum!",

I went with Beef & Broccoli but was able to add ingredients I enjoy, but aren't normally in this dish. It was fantastic!  I had peach tea to drink and it was very weak in peach flavor. It wasn't sweetened, which for me is a plus. The only negative is the big f-ing gong the cooks beat like an enemy if/when they get a tip. If the gong bothers you don't tip them.  Will definitely be going back again in the future.",

You then leave them to be grilled and eventually returned to you at your table. It's hard to review the food here because you create your own. If you don't like the finished product, well, it's your own fault. It's a matter of trial and error. I've been here 6 times so I know which meats and veggies I like and which seasonings and sauces--there are lots of choices, some spicy, some not, but for me, less is better. I like the teriyaki sauce and the honey soy with a little salt, garlic, and ginger. The important tip is to fill your initial bowl to overflowing because it will cook down. I find the small bowl is enough for me, but they have a medium and a large. You also get to choose what to put you meats and veggies over--white, brown, or fried rice, udon noodles, pasta, tortilla, or cabbage. Our server tonight was Katie and she was very attentive and friendly. As we went up to the buffet line, she said she would check back later to see if we'd done a good job! We had!",

    "text": "If you look at my past reviews, you'll notice that almost all my reviews are 5 Stars.  I just like sharing really good experiences with fellow Yelpers, who have always guided my way through culinary cravings or service needs.  And when I usually have a bad experience, I just let it go, mainly because I feel bad posting a negative review.  Not tonight!  I've been to Genghis Grill 3 times, and the last two experiences were both poor.  The first experience was a sit down experience with my wife, and it was a pretty good experience.  Nothing compelling enough to write a review, but a good overall experience.  So a couple weeks ago, we decided to place an online order for 2 large bowls.  They have a pretty impressive website where you can pick and choose your ingredients as if you were at the restaurant.  But unfortunately that's as good as it got.  After picking up our order & taking it home, they had mixed the ingredients between the two orders.  We gave them the benefit of the doubt, made the most of the meal, and called it a night.    So tonight, we thought, if we eat at the restaurant, it's pretty unlikely they'll mix the ingredients since you pick it out yourself.  Sadly, we never even got a chance to place our order.  After being seated, our waitress Taylor asked us for our order.  We told her we wanted 1 large bowl, since the last time we placed an order for 2 large bowls, it was too much food, and we only ate 1.  I told her if we're still hungry afterwards, we can always order more food.  She then snidely says \"you want 1 bowl for everyone?\", scoops up all her remaining bowls, and walks away, taking her unappreciated attitude with her.  I don't believe she even took our drink order.  So we left, and decided to dine elsewhere, and found a much more accommodating restaurant.  I get it.  I used to be a food server.  I understand that the bigger the bill, the larger your tip.  But treating your customers poorly and being rude is simply inexcusable.  For this, you have popped my negative review cherry, and I leave my first negative review.  =)",

If you make it right, you will want it again.  For the $ difference you can stretch the larger portion.    Fill your bowl and pack the content down.  I like to add a lot of spinach and cilantro to mine and they take up room, so I smush it down.    DON'T go heavy on the sauces.  Some of the veggies are water holders and can make your stir-fry watery.  That doesn't do well for left overs.  With the large you get three choices for \"base\" of noodles, something, something-I go for 3 portions of cabbage.  Try it, you will never miss the calories from the carbs.  Since you get to create your own meal here, it can only be as good as your choices.  In this place you can make smarter ones and have all the flavor you thought you would miss.  Good luck and have fun!  Oh and sign up for the Genghis customer card.  A free bowl on your birthday, isn't it nice when someone buys you lunch that day?",

When you get to the food station to create your bowl, there are posters on the wall that give you recommendations on how to put together certain dishes.  Meats:  They have chicken, pork, beef, and marinated sirloin tips.    Seafood: Calamari, crab, fish  Vegetables: choice of bean sprouts zuchini, green beans, japapenos, and a bunch more (this is all from what I can remember because I'm not really a vegetable person).  Spices:  There are an array of spices you can choose from.  Honestly, I put a little bit of everything and it turns out awesome.  My favorites are the ginger, garlic salt, and lemon pepper.  Sauces: So many to choose from.  When you bring your bowl to the counter, you have your choice of carbs.  I usually go with plain rice.  You can also throw in 1 or 2 eggs (to make it like fried rice) if you want.   At the end of the counter, you can find toppings such as crispy noodles, peanuts, and seasame seeds.  They cook it at the grill, so when you get your food it is going to be HOT!",

Seemed quick and efficient. They are part of a rewards program.",

As I walk in I am automatically greeted and seated. The waitress showed me three sizes of bowls to choose from (small, medium or large) and explained that I would need to go to this food station and pile the bowl as high as I could with whatever meats and veggies that I wanted, pick any sauces and hand it to the chef. I was honestly intrigued! I for sure picked the large bowl!       When I went to pick my meats, I had to try everything! They has garlic lime chicken, sriracha chicken, beef, pork, Korean beef, crab, calamari, scallops and more! I almost made the whole bowl nothing but meat. I decided to balance some veggies nearly on top. I then picked the two hottest sauces they had. One was a Chile garlic and the other was a sesame soy sauce. After I was finished I gave it to the cook and was asked what kind of rice or noodles would I like with it. If you get the small bowl you get to choose one, medium bowl gets two choices and the large bowl gets three. Since I had the large bowl I chose the Udon noodles, brown rice and spiral pasta. It took about 10 minutes for everything to cook and be served to my table.        The waitress came by our table to get our drink order. I was surprised when she told me that all the specialty lemonade came with unlimited refills! So I ordered the Jalapeno Mint Limeade, the Passion Ginger Limeade and the Raspberry Basil Limeada (made with Raspberry Jam). When my food came out to the table, I was pleasantly surprised on the portion. The taste of the food was flawless. The spicy didn't start living in till a quarter into my dish. The service and food was really impressive. I for sure will be returning soon. The end.",

On the plus side, though, they do offer free birthday bowls which I took advantage of. Today is my birthday so we didn't have to pay for a Regular bowl which is normally priced at $11.49.  Hubby chose a Large bowl which was $14.49. Prices are subject to tax, of course. If not for the birthday discount, the price would have been $25.98 plus tax. Since the bowls are rather on the small side, I would have to agree with reviewer Chris V. who posted about 5 months ago.  The other Mongolian grill we've been to was in Utah and we don't remember paying as much -- even with paying for 2 bowls -- and they were good too, taste-wise.  Genghis Grill has a self-serve soda service which is separate from the bowl price.  All in all, we had a delicious and filling meal which rounded the day off to a beautiful ending.",

I like how you put all your meat and veggies only and they put the carbs on so you don't have to balance a huge bowl piled high with your noodles on top. Don't forget to add an egg. No extra charge! I also appreciate the meat isn't frozen so you can really smash a lot in your bowl. The bowls look small, but trust me, it's a lot of food.  I just wish their udon noodles were a little chewier, but they'll do. You can also choose white rice, fried rice, or even just cabbage.  Don't forget to sign up for their birthday club. You get a free regular sized bowl (they have a small so you are actually getting a medium), no purchase necessary!",

The food is cook on a black top which transfers a black burnt taste and smell. I tried it once and one time is enough for me to not go back again.

Next time I'll remember to ask them to cook with less oil, I hadn't been here before, so I didnt know the drill!

They have some knock off tablet at each table for you to enter your order in, opposed to the convenentional waiter or waitress asking you for your order. Well, we tried two different tablets and both didn't work. Feeling bad for the waitress as she tried so hard. I don't understand why you have a waitress enter your orders in on a tablet when she could do it herself in half of the time. Give you an A for effort but a C- for execution at best.

You get this small silver cat dish and when they serve it ,it comes in a large red funky shaped bowl. As if no one can figure that out.   The fried rice looked ok, the noodles were disgusting. I should have refused to eat them as they made my stomach upset later in the day. Very, very greasy, sauces were sugery.  They have calories on the wall and I have a sneaking suspicion they are very misleading and the calorie count is probably without the carbs and sauces....  This place is run in a guise of hoping we don't notice we are being treated like knuckleheads sardined in for an 8.99 bowl of goo. The cat dish is what? to prompt you to what upgrade to a second bowl of goo?   Yes, the tables were small, there was 4 people in my party and I was afraid to move my elbow.  The bill was 45 bucks without tips. ( you get reminded to tip too via signs)... For that amount of money  you are better off going to the Great Greek On Warm Springs and you can eat off their family meal for a few days. By the way two people in the party were hungry later on in the day.. so after spending so much on lunch they weren't even full... seemed extra expensive on that note....     I was disappointed with the overall experience. It wasn't a total bust but I would not go back unless someone else wanted me to go. In short too much work and aggravation. Getting your own food, squeezing in and out of the tables, and too little of it for the price once you consider tax and tip.",

    "text": "Initial Impression and experience: So I have always loved Mongolian BBQ. I've dined at many in CA over the years, and this is the first one I've been to here in NV. When we walked up we were greeted outside the door and followed in to be seated right away. That was nice. We were sat at a table and told out waiter would be right with us. He came over and asked if we had ever been there. We said no, so he explained how it all works. Pretty easy to figure out, but whatever, we listened anyway. We got up and went to the food counter. All the food looked fresh and crisp. It was a little difficult to reach some of the items in the back because of the very low sneeze guard. The bowl they give you is VERY small, so everything you try to overstack falls off  :/ We watched them cook our food for a minute, and they came over to let us know our appetizer was on the table for us. So we went over to sit and eat.  Service: Service was on the a lot to be desired side. We each had a drink and they never refilled them for us. They actually took my boyfriends cup (like they were going to refill it) but never brought it back. They listened to my 13 year son over me on whether or not he was going to get all you can eat and brought him a second bowl to fill up anyway. I had to again tell them no, we are not getting all you can eat.  Food: The food was fresh and very good sauces and spices were available.  Price: TOO EXPENSIVE. There were 3 of us and we each got 1 bowl, an appetizer to share, and each a drink and we spent over $50. Too much to pay if you don't even end up with some left overs to take home. The price would have been fine if it was all you can eat that we did, but not for 1 tiny bowl.  Overall: We enjoyed the food a lot, but there wasn't enough and it was too expensive. I would go back, but not for the price. Like another person said, it's almost double what you would pay in CA for the same thing. You can even get close to this same type of food at any buffet here is Vegas and pay less, but have other options as well. I really liked the food and would love to go back, but only if they drop their prices.",

VERY friendly and helpful! Definitely the best looking Mongolian place I've been to. Unfortunately you can not eat all the above! If so it would be a 5 star joint. The food... Well it's hard to explain but it's not Mongolian BBQ. If they'd have left the mongolian out of the name and just called it Genghis Grill Stir fry, maybe I'd feel different. I just expected real Mongolian. I know it's a chain restaurant and you can tell they spent some dough in this place. But how do you screw Mongolian up? It's like these cats way over thought the concept? The meat was not good. The veggies combos were all wrong. And the sauces, which a prob the most important part were to thick! Way to thick. I don't care about the metal bowls and the cooks banging the gong when tipped, all I wanted was some descent Mongolian. What they have is way over done corporate over americanized Stir Fry.  Apparently you can get fajitas though? All you can eat! What a joke!",

Our server was friendly and gives you a tour for first timers.  Pile all you can into the bowl since it all shrinks down big time.  I thought I put cabbage in there.....where did it go?  Anyway I liked it all with your many choices of meats, veggies, spices, and sauces.  So each time it's a different experience of flavor.  Of course their tea is freshly brewed.... A huge shout out to that!  We will definetly start this place into our rotation of frequent places to eat.",

The portions are somewhat smaller than I expected. To be quite honest, the whole process of getting your food is a little confusing. I don't like the idea of the public being able to touch their own raw meat for some reason. It grosses me out. All the same....it's adequate but not fantastic.",

I knew there would be a problem when the server tried to tell me how simple it was. \"Just pick your protein\" she said several times.  Next she admonished to pile on the vegetables because they \"shrunk down to nothing!\"  So, I was handed this tiny bowl that had to accommodate both!  What should I do? The last time I had so much pressure was a Vegas timeshare presentation!  I had an idea, go with one of the bowl suggestions on the board behind me.  So I said to the kitchen helper, \"make me a Korean Bowl, please.\"   Her reply was \"you do that, the description of ingredients is only a guide.\"  My wife said, \"ok, where's the scallops?\"  That was when she was told they only had them at night.  Genghis Khan was a barbarian and True to its name, this place was pretty barbaric. Fortunately, we escaped with our lives!",

Today we went and it's the first time that I sincerely think we will never go back.  They changed their food service, they have 3 different sizes to choose from. Small, medium, large. The medium is the old style dish. We decided to try the large, it's barely larger then the medium bowl and it's $2 more. They no longer have all you can eat, we were told you can pay $5 to go back up. So now you pay more to eat less. I overheard the manager tell people these changes were for better customer service, to give ppl more options. No one but kids will eat the small, so who were the options for if you used to just be able to pay $2 extra for all you can eat? It's not for the customer experience, it's corporate greed at its finest.  Then they now give you paper cards to carry with you as you feel your bowl, to hand to the griller's. What am I supposed to do with the paper card while I'm trying to use both hands to hold my bowl and reach under sneeze guard for food to put in my bowl? Bad ideas, did anyone ever try these ideas out before implementation? Extremely disappointed that corporate greed to increase profits year over year is ruining this restaurant the same way it's ruined so many over the years.",

And the issue of the table that showed up about 15-20 min after we put or food up to be cooked, they got some of there food before we did!! Our last visit the mgr on duty did nothing about the issues then. This visit she did! High 5!!!!. The food is good the beer is cold, just not a place to visit with a large family or party.",

I went for lunch and the portion was just perfect. It's definitely not a cheap meal but I don't mind spending $15 on a quality lunch, so I felt I got my money's worth. I got the chicken and shrimp with tons of veggies and brown rice. Normally I'm hesitant to order brown rice at a restaurant but I gave GG a chance and it was perfection, not mushy or chewy. I added a little too much sauce though. A couple downsides... I don't like the seating arrangements. I felt like I was practically sitting with the table next to me. Also the pepper/onion mix was kind of frozen and almost out and I felt like I was digging it out so I had a lot of chunks instead of big pieces. The food station was also really messy. I also was worried about cross contamination because there were no staff members over seeing the food bar. I guess everything gets cooked but it still worries me. Overall I really liked this place and I'll definitely be back and recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh unique meal!",

    "text": "I really dont see where these one and 2 star reviews are coming from. I eat out a lot due to my lifestyle and having no time to cook. Due to working out and keeping in shape I eat at Teriyaki Madness, Greens and Proteins and my favorite Genghis Grill. I come here 4 days a week and have never had any problems. Great A+service, I'm always welcomed once I come in, staff is always helpful and the General Manager Reagan is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. She goes above and beyond to make sure you have an enjoyable experience each time you visit. Its hard to find good healthy food on the go because this country has fast food places at every corner and the pricest are cheap. Normally trying to eat healthy cost you a lot of money. So instead of going to a fast food place and getting a fatting meal and a soda for $6-$7.00 why not come here a get a healthy meal and an unsweetned ice tea for a few dollars more. Where else in the valley can you go where you can put as much meat on your bowl as you can with no weight limit? I can get enough meat on one regular size bowl (there is a strategy to it) and I can get two feeling meals out of it.  There are plenty of meats to choose from, a lot of seasonings, vegetables are always fresh, plenty of sauces to choose from and at the end you can choose your starch.  It takes me about 4 minutes to complete my bowl and 15 minutes for them to cook it before I'm on my way to work. Teriyaki Madness is good but you can get burned out on it because its cooked the same way.  Teriyaki Madness used to be generous with their meet but as they expanded and are known there starting to get stingy. With Genghis Grill you control how your bowl is. If your on a low sodium diet you control the amount of seasoning you can put in it. If your tired of a sauce, there are plenty of others to try from so I never get burned out from eating there. I already have 10 free bowls. 80% of being fit is what your eating. You can work out all day but if your diet is wrong you wont see results. Life is fast paced nowadays and if you got kids at practice and your wife or husband works as well as you its hard to cook everyday. This is a great option if you live life on the go like me.",

I like how you can pick any meat and vegetable that you want but can see how there can easily be some cross-contamination with the tongs.  It also took me awhile to get everything I wanted (because I wanted it all) and there wasn't a line.  I can easily see how it could take forever to get through that line.  It was rather quick though when we got it to the griller.    It was tasty.  I combined a lot of flavors and it still turned out pretty great!  I say definitely go and try it.  You will get a lot of food for not too much money.  I was lucky enough to have bought a Groupon so I saved even more.  The desserts looked great but I didn't try any.  Lastly, my stomach was fine after but within an hour or so, maybe longer, it definitely began to rumble and continued for a good portion of the day so beware!",

    "text": "We have always loved going to Genghis Grill but recently our experiences have been much better than usual due to the service of our waiter Jakov (not sure on the spelling but that's a close as I can get)  He is a wonderful waiter and treats us like royalty, refilling our drinks for us, boxing up our leftovers and frequently checking back to make sure eventing is great. The past 2 times we have visited Genghis, Jakov has made our dinner and time together much more enjoyable, because we didn't have to worry about a single thing, we knew that Jakov would come by and make sure everything was well.  We highly recommend Genghis Grill to everyone, the food is fresh and tastes great, the atmosphere is friendly and relaxed, and if you're lucky enough to get Jakov to be your waiter, then you'll have an extra special visit, for sure!   Genghis Grill gets 5 stars Jakov gets 10 stars, he is quite terrific!",

Everyone here was very helpful and the food was very reasonably priced. Not overly crowded during prime lunch hours but a steady stream of customers came through while I ate and each was taken care of in a very timely and professional manner. I recommend asking your waiter for suggestions on building your own bowl as it is very easy to mess up an otherwise delicious dish with what you think would be a good mix. I experienced that myself the first time I was here with a sausage and Crab fried rice that tasted like nothing but sausage and soy due to me adding too much of each. Great little gem of a restaurant, highly recommend.",

Why do you offer them if you are just going to remove them? I also requested both udon noodles and fried rice....no rice at all, both times I have been here, and very little noodles. So admittedly, although I like this place and think it is good, I was not as happy this time.

    "text": "This is my Husband's favorite spot. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. Genghis is a Mongolian grill. They give you a bowl to stack all your items in. You start with your protein: they have chicken, turkey, pork, beef, sausage, ham, shrimp, fish, crab, scallops, and pepperoni. Then you spice your protein. They have all kinds of spices. Everything from salt to ginger. Next you pick your veggies and wow do they have veggies!! All the things sprouts, peppers, potatoes, tofu, onions, eggs, mushrooms..ect. Now it's time to pick your sauce. They again have several to pick from: they have a honey soy, their signature sauce called 3G sauce, a spice sauce called Dragon sauce. It also tells you the heat level on them. Now you go over to the grill where the chef will ask you to pick your starch. They have brown rice, white rice, fried rice, udon noodles (my favorite) , spiral noodles and tortillas. Now they take ALL your things and cook it on a huge flat top grill! You can stand and watch or sit at your table. If one bowl just isn't enough for you they also have a bottomless option for a few bucks more.  They have a full bar or you can get your own drinks at their super cool coke freestyle machines. You can mix any flavor and soda you want. Plus unlimited refills.   Genghis also has appetizers and desserts, but I've never tried them. I always see people order the pot stickers.   A cool thing about Genghis is they have table side ordering system. Each table has a little computer where you can place your order and pay! It's very convenient.   Their staff is nice and friendly, but if your in a hurry this is not the place to go. It can take some time to get your bowl if there are a lot of people there. Overall no real complaints. The food is yummy and it's fun to pick all the things that go in your meal. Also, very healthy and a great place for kids. On Tuesday's kids eat free with an adult. Plus, on your birthday you get a birthday bowl for free if you join their email club.",

    "text": "Totally love their fun mongolian establishment! It is self serve, but they've got all the cool stuff, and an extensive selection of ingredients to choose from! So much you'd be so undecided on what to choose. So...after coming here a few times already, here's my advice:  1.) THE DREADED SILVER PLATE: They give you a silver plate which looks really small and depressing because halfway through filling your silver plate with stuff, you realize that the silver bowl is wwwaaaaayyyy too small, and you'll learn that really quick once you get your cooked food since they all shrink down to size after being cooked. MY SUGGESTION: pile high. no joke. PILE HIGH. don't be shameful. don't second guess. Yess....this is your game of jenga or tetris with food. Pile as high as you can. If you have to smush with your hands do it (it's not a crime to pile high nor is it a crime to take your time, people can go around you...).   2.) TASTE TEST YOUR FLAVORS! You can taste as much sauces as you'd like, and you can mix them. If you're not sure try them, and! The fun labels tell you EXACTLY what it pairs well with.   3.) INDECISIVE? DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START? No worries, in the beginning of the line they have fun recipe cards you can use and to help you start so then if you're looking to put in your flavor...you can play around with it. Think of it as an inspiration card.  4.) CHOOSE YOUR STARCH: I usually go with the brown rice. I love that that they have brown rice and I'm sure you healthy eaters will too. Think it's not enough? You can request for double!  5.) SELF SERVE COKE MACHINE: High five selling coke products, but even more of a high five for having that cool new digital coke machine! Mix and match every flavor known to man! You'll be sure to be indecisive in a drink here too.  6.) SUPER COOL TOUCH PAD: Here, you can split your tap with your lunch date and fun touch pad games while waiting.  **I love that this brings an opportunity to just get creative. You can be really interactive with it.  It does get busy during lunch, and the wait does take some time, so if you're in during your lunch break, expect that your meal won't come out in time for you to get back to the office.",

Ok so this is a Mangolian style bbq place where you load up your raw ingredients and then give it to a chef to cook. The options are endless. Chicken, steak, pork, ham, sausage, turkey, fish, shrimp, calamari, crab (imitation), and I am sure I missed something. Then you hit veggies. Stir fry, classic, pretty much everything you could think of. Then sauce. Kung Pao, Teryiaki, Curry, sweet, spicy, you name it! I think there are 8 different ones. You also have numerous spices, and herbs to add. If you can't decide, there are recipe card suggestions like Firecracker shrimp, Teriyaki Bowl, and Kung Pao chicken. For $11.99 you can fill your bowl once, if you are still hungry, add $4 for AYCE. Pile your bowl high because the veggies do decrease when they cook. Also, there are 3 appetizers. Lettuce wraps, edamame, and pot stickers. I prefer the potsticker, cooked well.  They have a full bar that I have yet to take advantage of. The servers don't do much, but they are always treating us like gold. Until this place shows a bad health grade, I will continue to be a regular here.",

They have a good selection of vegetables, meats, seafood and spices. The only bad thing is that I wish they had little recipes to make customized sauces. Love how these bowls taste. Be careful of what size you get since you add three options, you'll fill up quicky with noodles and brown rice.",

One of the greatest things about subway is your ability to indulge exclusively to the level of your dietary comfort, Ghengis Grill accomplishes the same feat.  Where it goes one step further is by giving you literally. Ever. Option. Under. The. Sun. You can build a bowl comprised of a gigantic plethora of vegetables and beans; any assortment or amount of seafood, meat, poultry, and tofu (depending on the day); coated in an exponential combination of seasonings and flavors; and seated atop a bed of any common carb source you could want. It's impossible to leave without having eaten what you wanted to eat. The restaurant is fantastic.  The staff is extremely friendly, and truly welcoming. Unfortunately their prices are not; their are deals depending on the day (and your birthday :D) but for a healthy casual place to eat it's terribly overpriced. Additionally, I have seen similar franchises which offer the same experience but with unlimited bowls, for a cheaper price. This restaurant should just commit and make themselves a competitive contender for the average persons choice in a casual meal.   This reviewer suggests you grab a date or fly solo, and explore your palette on a delicious feast.",

If you look at my last update, you'll know that this place has a lot to choose from.  This time, I decided to get the bottomless dinner bowl for $13.99.  I tried getting the Udon noodles on my first bowl and wasn't impressed.  The noodles didn't take much of the flavor I hoped it would.  Got the fried rice in my second bowl and I was a happy camper.  Love putting pork and shrimp in there, plus a lot of texture, like bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and other crunchy veggies.    At the end of my meal, I had to try the molten lava cake with ice cream for $4.99.  It was a light and fluffy cake, filled with fudge.  If you get this dessert, I would recommend adding the ice cream in to bring another flavor to the chocolate.  All in all, it was was great dessert and a great way to end my dinner there.  Last night was a wonderful time.  Great company, good food and great service!  Janean was our server and she was super attentive and funny as heck.  I know that the table next to us didn't have a great time with her, but I never judge the service by someone else.  Everyone has their own levels of service expectations and mine includes forgiveness.  With Janean though, there were no red flags and I truly appreciated her calling us by our first names at all times.  I have a great appreciation for this place and I know that you will too!  Be sure to stop by and get some Mongolian goodness!",

I prefer the Ice Tea. It is so fresh and refreshing. I would recommend this place for lunch or even a Date night. They also have a bar and my fiance had the Long Island Ice tea and it was good! We will be back. They also do take out in case you just want to pick up a bowl to go. You can build your won to go!",

    "text": "The first thing that stood out as soon as I entered this establishment was the fact that it was empty. The waitress came to our table and immediately hounded us with questions. We weren't even sitting yet! She also brought along 9 bowls with her in 3 varying sizes. She wasn't wearing any gloves, and the bowls were not on any trays. She asked us for our name and bowl size and then handed each of us a card and a bowl. I have been to two different Genghis in AZ so I found this particular practice odd and off putting. I am used to going to the food area and being handed there a bowl on a tray from someone wearing gloves. Also keep in mind that she brought 9 bowls and there were only 3 of us.. I can only assume that those remaining 6 bowls would be carried back to where ever she got them and used later because I certainly can't see them throwing those 6 bowls in the wash. Especially if this is the normal practice each time a customer comes in.. That would be a lot of unused bowls to be washed. So imagine how many times those unused bowls go back and forth between tables and how many times the waitress has to touch them (without gloves) and how many different waitresses end up touching the same bowl. Very unsanitary! This little practice alone caused us to leave and I am so glad I did. On the way out I noticed that they had a C grade! When there is raw meat sitting out, a C grade is very scary.",

    "text": "Mongolian BBQ Time  As my husband woke up today one of the first things out of his mouth was \"I'm hungry\"! I responded with we have this and we have that...but nothing was going to satisfy his craving except some mongolian bbq. I haven't ate any mongolian bbq in years, mainly because of food crossing other food. So, if you have any food allergies this could be dangerous. But my issue is with sesame seed oil, its a big trigger for my migraines. And being 8 months pregnant, well...I could go without the hassle of a migraine! As you could imagine my excitement about lunch was that of going to the doctors, but I sucked it up with a smile on my face.  As we walked into Genghis Grill we were greeted by the friendly staff. The place was clean and had a good atmosphere. Our server was nice and showed us how to build the bowls. She also asked if we had any allergies...so nice to know that they care about their customers. I was amazing at how organized and clean the food station was. The meat, vegetable, spice and sauce assortment was amazing, way better then any other mongolian bbq I've been too before! You have the choice of creating your own mix or taking a recipe off the wall. I chose shrimp, fish, cabbage, pineapple, mushroom, tomatoes, green & red peppers, bamboo shoots, snow peas and some great sauces! A little tip, press the vegetables down as you add more, otherwise you won't be able to fit everything you want in the bowl! When we got to the grill, the cook asked again if we had any allergies! Wow, thank you so much for asking that Genghis Grill grill cook!!! The grill cook will also ask if you want steamed rice, brown rice, noddles, spiral noddles or tortillas shells. I love all the different varieties of this place!  As we sat and waited for our food, it gave us a better chance to look over the menu. They have appetizers, desserts and a nice selection of beverages. By the time I was done reviewing the menu, the server brought us our food. Be fore warned...food is very hot when it comes off the grill!! I burnt my tongue, so don't be tempted to dig right in! After my tongue felt better and the bowl cooled off, I was able to taste my creation. Mine was delicious and my husband said his was pretty good as well! For an extra few dollars you can make your bowls unlimited, not that you really need too! Mine was filling enough but my husband had to try it again! After finishing my bowl and watching my husband eat his second, I decided to try some of their desserts. A nice  piece of pineapple cake. This was no ordinary pineapple cake, it had layers of cake and a type of cheese filling layers with a piece of pineapple in the middle. It was super yummy and the side of vanilla ice cream it came with, only made it that much better!!  So, as an over all experience...I'd say...I'll be back soon to eat more!! If you are lucky enough to have one of these in your area and you haven't tried it yet, you should! You don't know what your missing!!   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finapplesworld.blogspot.com%2F&s=15d1b635954e5eac798122b03763f8ddad710a8edec074dc2339db49c462bfcf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">inapplesworld.blogspot.c...</a>",

We've talked to management and get excuses and statements like, \"oh, we're just really busy\", \"we're still training\", etc. The quality of the ingredients is really good and the service is pretty good, too. Where this place falls down is the cooking. They just can't seem to get the concept that the bowls need to be placed on the grill in the order they arrive and come off in that order, too. Three of the four times we've been I've had burnt food because the cooks are standing around talking or horsing around lighting the grill. If you've ever been to a real Mongolian BBQ I think you will be disappointed in this place. We're hoping somebody recognizes the potential and opens up a good one!",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place out, I'd heard nothing but good things about it from friends in other cities. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed.   First off, the tables are WAY TOO close together, and some are placed in the most awkward and ridiculous spots. So we sat down, ordered an appetizer, and then got our instructions to fill our little bowl up at the bar with meats and veggies. I thought this would be a fun experience, it was not. We started with the meats, which were completely raw. I know it gets all cooked together, but just the thought of it and the fact that the raw meat is so close to the other food items just irked me out.  So I put some raw chicken and raw steak bits in.  They tell you at the beginning to \"load it high\" with veggies but it just becomes annoying as you make this little mountain of veggies that keep toppling all over the place, not to mention the glass casing makes it nearly impossible to grab veggies from the other side..ugh it was just annoying.  Then we get to the sauces, which like others have said, look like all the same high fructose corn syrupy goodness. We chose our starch (I got brown rice, my friend got noodles) and went back to our table.    The bowls came out fairly quickly, yet still no appetizer.  The appetizer finally showed up when we had nearly finished...I almost wanted to ask if the server could just take it back.  Anyhow, the food was meh.  I tried my friend's noodles and they were absolutely awful, please don't opt for those. They were flavorless and a strange consistency.  I feel like I could make the same dishes at home fairly easily and much much healthier.    One last thing, when we got our bill, we noticed it had charged us the price for the \"unlimited\" bowls, when we'd each had just one. We asked the server about this and she said that that's the only way the bowls are charged, but pointed out a credit at the bottom where we were each credited $2 for not doing the unlimited. Seems like a strange, unnecessary way to do the billing (??).  I don't think I'll be back here, if I want a healthy bowl of rice, chicken, and veggies I can just make it at home.  If I want an authentic Mongolian BBQ, I'll go anywhere else.",

    "text": "I have eaten at this location and the two different locations in Reno many, many, times over the last few years.  I have recommended Genghis to many of my friends as well.   I used to love the food.  Over the years they have made several changes which I have disliked.  They no longer have shrimp.  They used to have steak....they changed it to steak tips.  They have raised the price, and changed it to different sizes.   Through all of that I continued coming.     I just finished my final experience here.   I have had some minor issues with the service before,  but, generally everyone has been friendly.   Tonight, despite their friendliness, I stormed out.  After you finish your first bowl your server comes over and asks if you want the ayce option.  If I am hungry I would prefer not to sit there and wait 15 minutes while my waitress is having a conversation at another table.  Especially while many other employees pass me by.   Funny thing is after about 10 minutes someone came by and said let me get that bowl out of your way( my original bowl)....but took off before I could even ask about another bowl.    I sat there and sat there and finally flagged down an employee and told her I was leaving what I thought would be enough for my food, beverage, and tax.  ($15).  I might have overreacted and could have been more patient,  but there were like 4 tables going in the whole place.   Sick thing is I work in the service industry, and I don't even mind that my waitress was having a conversation.....just hold up on it for a quick second to come over and approve my second bowl....then go right on back.   I was very surprised to see so many poor reviews piling up for this place, but I guess I understand why now.",

    "text": "Big disappointment & an even bigger ripoff -  $68 for limp, overlooked edamame, 4 medium sized bowls & 4 drinks is ridiculous. Especially when the food you end up with isn't even that good. I've been to many good Mongolian BBQ places & unfortunately, this wasn't one.  My hubby & youngest son had been there before & liked it, my oldest son & I had not.  1st disappointment was that they were out of shrimp. I was trying to build a variation of their firecracker bowl which has shrimp, calamari & scallops in it so that was annoying. The guy just said they weren't carrying shrimp anymore. Really? Maybe they shouldn't have shrimp listed on their menu as an option then.  Something else to note, not a disappointment, but def another annoyance.. It was extremely difficult to reach the food bins in the very back row bc the sneeze guards are so low. I'm not short nor do I have short arms.. 5'10\" & I'm sure I looked ridiculous trying to reach the veggies that I wanted lol Last but not least, I had to completely remake my bowl bc the 1st one was inedible. Well, actually my hubby remade it bc at that point, I was over the whole \"experience\" & just wanted to leave. The calamari rings were closer to rubber bands & the whole thing just tasted \"off\" Bad seafood-not good!",

    "text": "I like this place.   I liked it better when we first found it and they still served shrimp.   Pros: make your own bowl, get your own drinks, no waiting for service if you don't order extras. mix and match meats, veggies, sauces, etc.   Cons: it is REALLY awkward to reach the items in the back row, based on how the \"sneeze guard\" is situated. They stopped serving shrimp. It gets really messy sometimes (possibly also due to the awkwardness reaching the back items). there isn't really much service if you don't order extras. we've had to ask for clean bowls multiple times when they were handed to us.   I will still go here, and I like it, but it's not a \"must have\" list.",

    "text": "I took my teenage daughter here on a Saturday afternoon while we were running errands & was very pleased.  While I was familiar with the concept of Mongolian BBQ, she was not, so the waitress took her time explaining exactly what needed to happen.  I had to help out a little bit along the way, but the waitress (Kat?) was great.    We went down the food-bar making our bowls, and while yes, the silver bowls that they give you are pretty small, it's pretty easy to stack all of the things you want inside.  Personally, I ended up with a bowl of food that was bigger than I could eat, as did my daughter.  The choices were good, though there were a few things that I felt were missing.  I would have liked some better options in the produce, but it was still pretty good.  There were a LOT of protein options - steak, chicken, shrimp, sausage, etc.  I used marinaded steak and shrimp.  Sauces and spices - again a lot of options.  As I'd never been here, I wasn't sure what I wanted, but I pieced it together and was happy with the end product.  To top it off, your carb is separate.  While many places give you a bigger bowl, you often have to stuff your noodles in there as well as the meats and veggies.  Genghis doesn't do it that way.  When you give your bowl to the chef, you tell him which carb you want.  I went with the Udon and was happy to see that they were Udon noodles and not spaghetti noodles, like I sometimes see.  All in all, a good experience.  I'd like to go back again sometime for dinner & try the scallops.",

They have cards that offer suggestions on what to choose, or you can choose whatever sounds good. Get more veggies than you think...smashing it down in the bowl as you go along...as they cook down. I loved the idea of grabbing an egg so there would be scrambled egg in the mix, so don't forget to grab the egg along the way if that's what you like. Yum!  Really liked the experience.

    "text": "Pretty much walked in, went thru the line and walked out. That place was gross, smelled like vomit and was extremely unsanitary. I knew I'd most likely get food poisoning if we stayed.   I've worked in the food industry and I've been to other Mongolian places but this was plain nasty. It was a salmonella nightmare.  They were out of chicken so the girl washing dishes right by it went to get more. Same plastic gloves from the washing, touching door handles, etc and they were so used up they were falling off her hands. Then she takes the tongs from the chicken vat, puts them on the countertop, uses her hands to smooth out the new chicken in the vat then with her slimy gloves, covered in raw chicken picks up the tongs and puts them back in the vat. The tongs were disgusting. We all used them and got raw chicken all over our hands. They were out of most things, nothing looked like it was refrigerated or maintained. The items are three deep and you need loooong arms so they probably get all kinds of debris in the open containers from ppl having to bend and stretch to reach in. Nothing on their side was covered with a sneeze guard or anything.   It was Sunday night around 6 pm. Place was pretty empty but the hostess still put our party of two RIGHT in the middle of a large group of people.   I know people love this place and have enjoyed many meals here without incidence but I was not going to take that chance. It takes a LOT for me to get grossed out by a restaurant. This is my first and probably only review. This place needs an intervention!  I've eaten tacos from roadside stands in Mexico and have never been grossed out like this. Spillage everywhere u looked. Dirty floors, tables, etc.  Yuck!",

The drinks are self serve you just go and get your drinks from the soda machine and they will charge accordingly. the special they are doing is 20 percent off appetizers and 2 or 3 dollar bottle beers which is nice.

Here is the one exception I had with this place - the bowl that you fill up with meat and veggies was very small.  I prefer my meal to be mostly meat and veggies, with a small amount of rice or noodles.  I know I had the option of having cabbage as my base, but would have preferred just a bowl full of stir fried meats and veggies!  Still, the service was prompt and friendly.

    "text": "As solid a mongolian bbq as it gets.  All the fixins, a clean restaurant and friendly staff.  It's not a new concept but it has more options than I've seen at other similar places, especially when it comes to seafood.  I came here with a girlfriend for lunch and we were in and out in less than and hour (with at least half of that chit chatting like old girlfriends do).  They offer alcohol and I like that although you essentially make your food yourself, they've leaned toward a traditional restaurant setting where it's delivered to you and your drinks are refilled by a server.  It makes it less of a fast food feel, which I appreciate.  With that being said, don't forget to tip the servers.  They deserve and you'll thank yourself later.  Or at least karma will. I love that you have total control of what goes in your meal.  No need to ask your server to hold this, add that or make any (obnoxious) substitutes.  Tip: If you seriously pack your bowl, no need to get the 2 trip option.  It's pretty impressive how much food will fit into that little bowl and somehow, it seems like even more once it's cooked.  Join the Ghengis Rewards program for lots of promos and goodies.  You won't be disappointed.  Oh, one last thing - please wash your freaking hands before filling your bowls and keep your darling little children away from the food if they're unable to keep their hands to themselves.  Please and thank you!",

    "text": "I had never heard of this place before...but had driven past is various times and decided to stop and see what it was all about. The concept is pretty simple, you purchase a bowl (out of three sizes) and fill it up with all the protein and vegetables you want. I chose the medium size and it came with the option of picking two sides. With the large you can pick 3 and with the small 1. The medium was more than enough and I had plenty of food to take home. The server was very nice and she told us to fill up the bowl as much as we wanted. This is good to know because at first the bowls can seem small but they actually fit a lot of food.   You do have to season your food and pick the sauces you want in your stir fry. Each seasoning has a small teaspoon and I really recommend you don't go overboard here. It is easy to over season and end up with a salty mess. I also recommend you go slow on all of the sauces. It is also easy to pick too many sauces and then end up with a soupy over seasoned meal.   I do have to say that my and the hubbies meals came out really nice. We were pleased with all of the options. We also tried their Nutella dessert which was pretty good. The crispy friend wonton filled with Nutella and drizzled with honey were delicious. The ice cream per se was ok.   My only recommendation is just to be careful with your sauces and spices. It would be nice for the restaurant to have sort of a recommended guide for its costumers detailing which sauces pair well with others and how to season meats. Otherwise the service was excellent and the food came promptly. Thanks!",

The mushrooms are litteraly frozen to the pan, the seasonings are missing scoops. Theres chickin IN the steak. Theres shrimp in the chicken.  The handles are all dirty.  Finally get my bowl to the chef.  Tip them VERY well hoping they would actually cook my shit right. TWENTY MINUTES LATER, bowl after bowl goes out and mine still isnt ready.   I left.  Cancel that!!!!!!! Terrible place. Dirty. Slow. Waste of time.  Never going back!",

Everyone here is willing to help and you're not constricted to only asking \"your\" waiter for assistance with anything. The drinks are self-serve which is nice because they're the coke freestyle machines and I always appreciate being able to refill at my own pace so I don't leave a full cup behind. All of the staff are lighthearted and can always be found with smiles because you can tell they all like their job (or at least at really good at pretending!). I'm pretty good at stacking my food so I needed a size up with the bowl and they even split it into two large bowls because of how much food I had. As a result the rice got kind of lost underneath all the other food and they gave me more, complementary!  Overall it's a great atmosphere, great food, and some of the best customer service you'll receive in Vegas.",

    "text": "Our waiter was very kind and the food was good. Those two factors are the only reason this restaurant is getting more than a 1 star, because the price and starch portion quickly made this a place I don't think I'll frequent again. I've only ever been to Mongolian grill restaurants in Chicago, but I'm used to them being \"all you can eat.\" Not only is this a single serve restaurant, but there is no kids menu. My son had to get the smallest bowl, which was still pretty pricey.  The sizes of the bowls left me hopeful...until our food was brought to us. The amount of rice that was given to my son, and the noodles for my own bowl, were laughable. I was so shocked that I even commented to our waiter that the starch portions seemed rather small. I had hoped that the portions would at least reflect the price and the fact that this isn't \"all you can eat.\" Guess I was wrong. I'm really bummed, becasue as I said, the food was good. But my son and I both left hungry. I've found other restaurants in the area that are \"all you can eat\", have a kid's menu, AND are less expensive than this. I'll give them a try.",

For sauce I poured the garlic.  After you fill your bowl, you drop off your entry to the chef and they cook it right there!

The cooks on the other hand were \"something else.\" One cook was on his phone while cooking the food on the grill. An extra order of potstickers were made and same cook helped himself to them not gloves then returned to cooking. One of the waitresses asked for a red bowl and he was talking so loudly and not paying attention she had to ask several times. Finally, she raised her voice and then he laughed about.   The sauce cups were soaking wet with sauce residue which means they were completely clean or dried off. So were the trays to the point my food almost fell off the tray.

I gave in and the people I went with 2 of 3 of us had never been here-  We were greeted at the door by hostess. She was a pleasant young gal who asked have we been here before- I think she could see my lack of excitement or want to be there but talked with ad as she sat us explaining that out server would be right over and if I had any doubts or dislikes to come let her know- So comes in our sever- Jaakko (yes this is his name) what a lovely man, his attention to everything and detail was over and beyond. He was not only friendly but he ooozzed hes passion for his job and love ove what he did. He explained how the ordering and making of the bowls worked- we laughed and he broke the ice and fear of this new place for me. He more then once said he would suggest ideas or I could read/ get us cards provided w recipes to make. He also was helpful on serving size (3 to choose from) it seems so simple but cups are deceiving and you could easily order a size WAY more then you could eat if this wasn't explained. The line you go through has a huge selection of meats and veggies. The selection is so vast you could eat 3 meals a day for a week with out having the same meal. You get to choose a sauce to add flavor along w seasoning and then off to the cooking area. Your asked choice of starch or even cabbage (vs rice, noodles, ect). I was offered an egg to add to it and it was a great success! I cant even tell you the shock of feeling like a chief and having control of  what I was eating and what was added or not. I was asked and offered if I didn't like it to be able to remake it but it was so good I cant wait to go again.  Now this isnt fine dine but for sure not a fast food place... it was a great costumer service experience and I cant tell you how great our service was. Thank you. Cant wait till I try more boldly bowls!!",

I have so much good to say about this place from the staff to the food to the atmosphere always showing espn on every screen big plus for me. I would say that I love how u just have to ask for shrimp and they add at the grill only minus is they are some ver small shrimp. Also I'm not a fan of being sat right by the entrance door when there are seats available all through out. But that doesn't outweigh the deliciousness of the meal. Being able to put as much as u can in a bowl recreating the leaning tower of pizza is the goal and they encourage it. Your pretty much the chef and what u choose to be in your food is what your going to eat so don't be bashful. Overall an amazing experience for adults and children alike!! I'll always come",

Being that I had this exp. before it was slightly different since I was expecting a bowl to fill up the choices before grilling as they had a choice of silver plates asking you if you would like small, medium, or large.  Well I chose medium started to fill my plate with choice of Siracha Chicken and when I t was time to pick out the spices just have fun with it do not get technical choose what excites you same with the veggies whatever catches your eye and at the end when it comes time to choose your sauces for flavor do half of one choice in your side cup and add half of another flavor sauce choice in the same side cup.  Finally when you get to the grilling area again do not get techinical have fun I did half Udone Noodles and half Brown Rice.  Quite enteresting dish when the server brought our food I created a very flavorful exotic and fun mix as long as you do not get techinical just choose what appeals to you and do now worry how it will come out and that is how I will say you will enjoy this place have fun and just get creative with your choices!  If you get to techinical you will miss out on the exp. of having a creative dish that you just invented and do not worry everything is great here so sure to be flavorful!",

The sign on the front door said they were out of a few of their sauces, not a huge deal, but strange and we were at least informed before getting in line.  The area where you make your bowl wasn't well stocked and they were even completely out of a few things.  The sauce area was VERY messy and needed to be wiped down.  Nobody was behind the area to service it   We ate around 3pm, and eventhough they weren't busy, they were behind on the cooking of the bowls.  The whole cooking area looked dirty.  The hand washing sink next to the grill was broken and spurted water up onto the wall and caused the floor to be wet.  Used metal bowls and dropped food debris could be seen on the floor as well.  The whole place needed a cleaning and some repair work.  An upholstered booth seat was heavily torn and the black tape used to cover the holes had been there long enough that it was peeling up and almost gone.  Why not get something liked that fixed?  Even the edge of the red bowl my food was served in was chipped. Lunch for 2 with sodas was $40 including tip. The food tasted fine and the service was average, but the lack of cleanliness and normal maintenance makes me not want to return.",

My girlfriend told me it was \"soooo gooood\" and I thought it would be alright but after coming here she was right. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. I even had a 5-minute conversation with one of the servers about tattoos. Super relaxed place and friendly environment. But let's be real you guys want to know about the food. Well, the food was just AMAZING. I am begging my girlfriend to come back here but she doesn't want to because supposedly Genghis Grill is a Reno thing so she is keeping me away at least until I go to Reno with her and try it again over there. Why are girlfriends like this? Anyway, try this place. I'll come back after my Reno trip.",

The seating area could use some sprucing up, looks like they put yard sale furniture to decorate. Oh well on the food. I went for the regular bowl and my friend coached me into the building process. I picked out chicken,pork and beef along with some bellpeppers and other goods.  The dudes that take your bowl and cook had blank looks on their faces which was kinda disturbing they didn't greet me tell me what my # was nothing. Any who grabbed our drinks and sat down to wait for the chow. It was pretty good but not phenomenal, usually they have these build a bowl stations at some Asian buffets. The price tag was a bit steep for what they give you. The hostess gals were nice, service was prompt. Probably won't make a habit out of visiting here unless it's one someone else's dime. Their portion to price ratio is a little skewed for my taste.",

    "text": "Interesting to go to a Chain style grill place.  Price - 5 star - For lunch, you can fill up your little saucer for 8.99 and then add your choice of starch.  Makes for a nice lunch meal   For 2.00 more, you can have a second bowl or more.  Ambiance - 5 star - Clean organized, plenty of seating.  Roomy too.    Food - 2 star - All very nice in presentation,  well cooled.  However, everything was very hard to get to, the plexiglass protection from your face to the food is so short that anyone over 5'10 has to bend over and stretch to get to the food.  Overall, very inconvenient, but large choice of meats, vege and sauces.  Cooked - 2 star This is very uninspired.  IT is grilled on the big hot grill like all Mongolian Grills are.  However, the taste just comes out \"okay\"  It isn't to die for, and is quite like having cafeteria food.  Decent, filling, and not bad.  Just not great.  Service - 4 star - everyone is very well trained, cordial, pleasant and it would be a five star, but there is not a lot to \"serve\" other than drinks, hot sauce and the bill.    Overall, a nice clean and decent place to dine.  Just not really asian food. It is same as going to Panda Express for Chinese, or Taco Bell for \"mexican\".  Good for American Style, just not really authentic.  They have a nice bar, that is a plus for you Thirsty Dogs!",

This is one of those restaurants where you can completely control what proteins, spices, veggies, sauces, and starches go into your bowl. There's no limit to how much you want; as long as you can fit it in your bowl you're good to go!   Their buffet set up is usually stocked and well kept but the last couple times I've eaten here, they seemed to be dropping the ball. Meats would be completely out or spices that you would see one day wouldn't be there the next. I totally understand a container being empty, but when you ask the employee if they can restock it and you never see them again, it gets a little frustrating.   Other than those inconveniences, they're always quick with getting your bowls cooked and have delicious options for the whole family!",

They have a good amount of selections between beef, chicken, and seafood. Good vegetables vegetables and sauces too. It was a very pleasant experience. Food was cooking timely and wasn't over cocked.  The only issue i had the server wouldn't come by often, I sat with an empty bowl for quite some time but since we came with a large group and were talking most of time time, didn't affect the experience too much.  They also use a lot of udon noodles, maybe to fill you up faster Incase you get the unlimited bowl. I was able to eat 2 bowls both with udon noodles.  Overall it was fun and great food will definitely return.",

    "text": "I've finally stopped in after driving by this place for years...I'm glad I finally made a visit...  Genghis service and ambiance:  The layout is like a hybrid restaurant/franchise setup with plenty of seating and Mongolian decor.  After you pick the size of your bowl, you go and load it up to be freshly cooked by the chef afterwards.  When your bowl is complete the server delivers your food to the table.  Our server was fantastic but it took awhile to get our bowls.  After 20 minutes it came around. You serve your own drinks at the Coca-Cola soda machine that hosts a plethora of drinks to choose from the Coke family products.  Genghis cuisine:  We started with the pot stickers and they were good for a casual restaurant. All the dishes we ordered were flavorful and cooked well by the chef.  My sesame beef with Udon noodles was very tasty and got me full quickly.  I also tried the chicken with udon noodles and the chicken was juicy and savory.  Hats off to the chef for putting together all the bowls very well.  The AYCE is a great option if you're really hungry and have the time to bring up multiple bowls to be cooked.  For me, the large bowl was plenty of food and I was stuffed.  They packed up the food that we couldn't finish which add to their great service.  I'll probably swing by again to try different meat and sauce combos sooner versus later.  Enjoy!",

I personally go with small, since you can stack it up as far as you can!  You go up to a bar with an array of meats and veggies, and finish by choosing a sauce and base (noodles, rice, etc.) The steak tips are awesome! Use as many veggies as you want as well.   The service is super fast. We came in and were seated immediately. Got our food within 10 minutes!  I definitely would recommend this place!

Went in on a monday afternoon for lunch and i'm so glad I did! Our server explained the whole process (since it was our first time) and told us to pile everything as high as we could. We both got regular sized bowls and were VERY satisfied. Great selection of meats, veggies and sauces. Can't wait to go back again and recommend this place to all my friends!",

    "text": "This place is amazing!!  I love the whole fill your plate to the rim and there you go. Ok so here's how it goes, for those that haven't been to this amazing establishment before. So once you walk in you get seated by the greater obviously and your server comes by and sets down 3 plates a small, regular and large one. I usually go with the regular one because if you fill it up how I fill it it's more than enough (well for me) And then you go and attack the assembly line of meats and veggies! If you can't or don't even want to make up your own beautiful creation of random meats and veggies there is always the cards they have so you can pick and follow what they say. So what I do is load up on veggies and then come back and pile up the mountain of my meat options and after you do that you move on to pick your sauce and take it to the counter and pick your noodles and what kind of rice you want (if you want rice) and after that you sit and wait to have your creation brought to you and ENJOY! My experiences here have always been great and I highly recommend this place to everyone!",

Definitely fill up your bowls till they overflow. That's one thing I wish I knew since it was my first time there and wasn't told to do. You definitely always seem to have more food for the next day or if you're really hungry you can chow down a lot of food for a pretty reasonable cost.  The place looked pretty clean. It was a bit dark and the person that was supposed to seat us wasn't there so it was a bit awkward walking in the restaurant and then being told, \"oh please go back, you have to be seated.\" Other than that it was a pretty good place.",

This is the 1st ever Mongolian Grill restaurant that I've been to that is not all you can eat. Usually it's a buffet and you can eat all you want. Grant it, you can drink all you want but you choose a bowl size with 1 trip. You can take your leftover food home in a to go box. That's a plus.   With regards to the table layout, it was pretty nice. Easy to navigate through the areas and the ingredients area was clean.  The food was delicious and I would go back to eat if I had to meet someone there. At least try it - you will definitely like it.",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting Genghis Grill. The experience is quite interesting. You pick the size bowl you want and then select your choice of proteins and veggies to be added to your bowl. You will have your choice of seasonings and sauces for your creation. This is where I went wrong. I didn't know if the spices had salt or not so I erred on the side of caution and under-seasoned. Be liberal with the salt and pepper and then add at least two of the cups provided of sauce. One cup of sauce is not enough! Mine was a bit dry due to a lack of sauce. I have no one to blame but myself though.   Once you've finished preparing your bowl, take it to the counter and it will be cooked for you. You can choose to add cabbage or noodles at this point. I hear that you can also add hard boiled eggs for no additional charge.   It will take a while to get your food out to you so best not dine here if you are in a hurry.   My only suggestion would be for the servers to give sauce to bowl ratio recommendations. For example: if you get a large bowl, add 3 cups of sauce, or seasoning recommendations, \"try the Cajun seasoning with the garlic sauce.\" This would be very helpful.",

Love that you can put cabbage in your stir fry and no do starches.  However, this place is Pricey for what you get.  $15.00 is a full order entree at most Asian style restaurants that is shareable.  All of your protein and vegetables have to fit in this bowl and things like spinach cook way down.  I hate to say this but to get your money's worth you really need to just get protein and pack it in there really well.  The service is excellent but the beverages are pricey as well and they are self serve.  I think for four people our check was $100.    Its just a little over the top for a casual Asian place in pricing.",

    "text": "I've tried this place twice and each time the anticipation was greater than the end result.    The idea is so exciting because the possibilities seem endless.  You can pay for unlimited meals or just one, but either way it seems a little expensive for what you get.  They give you 2 bowls - one for your food and a smaller one for your sauce.  You build your meal by going through a buffet line and choosing your meat(s), veggies, seasoning, and sauce.  You can pile it high to the point of overflowing or you can keep it small.  Tip: the veggies really shrink when cooked so your bowl will look a lot emptier when it comes back to you.  Fill accordingly.  Then you choose your starch (rice, pasta, noodles, etc.) when you get up to the grill.    The line is the real issue at this place.  If there's more than one person ahead of you, prepare to move through at a glacial pace.  As people mull over the options, or if they are out of something that someone wants and you need to wait for the employees to refill it, you WILL. NOT. MOVE.  It's horrible!    I've tried a few of the sauces and the only one worth a damn to me is their 3G sauce - their basic one that they say goes with everything.    I do like their soda machines (the type that you can choose any drink and add flavors).  They also have a full bar so you can grab cocktails with your meal.    I guess it could be a good place if no one is there when you are and you find your favorite sauces/combos.  But to me, it's not cheap enough/good enough to deal with the line.  If I want mongolian grill and feel like waiting on a line, I'll pay less money and go to Green Valley's Feast Buffet.",

Other than the cooks errors, the food was pretty decent UNTIL my wife and I got home a few hours later.  Both of us felt queezy (we shared each others meals) and then by midnight, we were both vomiting.  I apologize for the graphicness, but my wife literally had 2 small flies in her vomit.

    "text": "Worst 15 dollars that I have ever spent and that was just for lunch. Let me explain.  I come in on a Wednesday around 11:30 am. I am greeted by the host and shown to a table. Since I have never been here before, I am briefed on the process of getting my food. They give you two of what appears to be small dog food bowls and a small dipping sauce type of cup. One bowl you put in veggies and the other meat. For the dipping sauce type of cup, yup you guessed it, different sauces to mix in to your choices when it is being cooked.  Once you are done selecting your choices, you go up to the counter and hand it off to whoever is there that will cook it on the big circular flat top grill. You have to specify what kind of carb you want cooked with your ingredients like brown rice, noodles, etc. Then when its done cooking, your server will  bring it out to your table.  Now what I just described doesn't sound bad now does it? What im about to break down for you should convince you not to come here or at least if you try it, you will be uttering, \"Oh, that's what Roger T was talking about in his review.\"  First off, you have two options to decide before you start eating. Single trip or all you can eat. Prices are as follows: Lunch 8.99. Dinner 10.99. Add 4 dollars more to do the all you can eat option. By the way, it used to be 3 dollars.  Since I was really hungry and planned on making multiple trips to get my money's worth, I chose the 13 dollar all you can eat. That is just for the food yall. Drinks are not included. I decided just to have water.  So I do my thing and try to cram as much meat and veggies into my bowls. Their meat and veggie choices all seem to be housed in tiny containers which makes you feel like a pig if you are trying to get a lot of a certain meat or veggie. By the way, the only difference between lunch and dinner is for dinner you get calamari and scallops. That's great news you say? Well, based on what I have seen, I wouldn't be surprised if these were tiny little cut up pieces.  I sit down and wait for my food. After about 5 minutes later, I received it in a weird odd sized bowl/plate? When I see my food, I swear I thought I put a lot of veggies and especially meat since I am a carnivore. What you gotta understand is when all these items you select are grilled together, they shrink a lot.   After I finished my bowl, I was ready to go and grab some more food. This is where the deception is because in order for you to go up and get more food, you have to tell your server exactly that and they will go get you new bowls. This is where you will notice the difference between these guys and other traditional Mongolian Grills. The ones im familiar with, you grab your own bowls and do your thing. The only waiting you do is for the cooking. Not these guys. Sometimes it takes a while for the server to come around just so you can ask for more bowls. Then you have to wait for them to come back with your bowls. Then you have to wait for it to be cooked. When it gets done cooking, it sits on the counter until your server picks it up and puts it on your table.  So you see this is where my gripe is. By the time I came around to my third serving, I was starting to feel that full feeling which doesn't make sense because at other places, I can easily go through 3 servings and not feeling full at all. The process that you have to go through to get your food, whatever you ate prior is starting to settle which gives you the im not hungry feeling any more.   My total bill came up to about 14 and some change. I put 15 bucks on the table and walked away. My server was slow in everything. Don't get me wrong. Its not like I was in a rush but at the same time I don't have all day. I think this place is a scam. Their process purposely slows everything down so you don't get to eat as much as you really want. The day I went, it didn't get really busy until about 12. When it gets really busy, you will have to wait even longer in between each serving.   So you see, it really isn't worth it to eat here whether you choose all you can eat or not. I recommend going to the Fiesta Buffet just up the street off of Lake Mead for their Mongolian Grill. Lunch is 7 bucks and dinner is 10 bucks with a player card. You not only get two big bowls to put ingredients in, but the only time you wait is when it is being cooked. Plus they have other choices there and not just the Mongolian. Its not the best but it sure as hell beats out these guys. This also will prompt me to check out Stir Krazy Mongolian Grill on Paradise Rd since I heard good things about them.",

    "text": "I ate here last year & forgot just how much I love this place! You create your own dish however you like. Select your type of meat from chicken to crab to beef to turkey or more. Select whatever veggie you like including some fruits. Choose your seasoning/s & sauce/s then your choice of carbs (noodles, rice, etc). Pile it up as high as you like! Pass it on to the chef & they make it for you & have it served to you at your table. You can def end up making 2 meals out of your one meal you've made. The food is so delicious! You can actually order your food from your table as well via their mini IPads.   This is def a place you have to check out as it is alot of bang for your buck, healthy as much as you like it, & VERY tasty & if it's not well guess you should remove some items for next time since you're the creator. Too bad there isn't one closer to where I live",

    "text": "Redemption?: After a 1 Star Review, has Genghis improved? With family in from Nebraska who wanted Mongolian BBQ it was time to find out. And after my 1st review of this place brought me a LOT of flak, private messages, and even some hate messages, I was like I'm going to wait to do a 2nd review. But that time is now and here it is. (I edited / added to this review, critics can go read the additional comments at the bottom.)  We went in for lunch on a Friday and I stayed quiet acting like I had never been there before as the person with me had not been there. We were seated promptly and given our super tiny little dog bowl for our meat choices and the hamster sized water cup for our sauces and listened to the whole spiel. Then we got dragged up to the counter and was having the process of bowl building explained when we got rushed through it as another horde of people started to come through.   It's still a pain in the rear to reach the food offerings to build your bowl with, the calimari and high end meats are gone, the spices are lame as I said before, and the black and brown goo sauce choices are still there. The same slow griller process is also in place, and yes they still use the absolutely asinine cards with the bowls to keep track of things. ( BD's does it so much better! ) The person I was with kept comparing it to HuHot in Lincoln, NE and she said out loud that this process sucked.   The food we got was ok. I ignored the griller recommendations and went with brown rice. Brown rice is hard to mess up, and it provides some food stability. (It's that Misti Y influence at work again.)  It's one item that usually won't suck. It was a good choice as this time the food was not as bad as last time.  But after I got tired of using the chopsticks I went to unwrap one of the cheapest food service mass produced forks in history only to find it's DIRTY! SCREECHING HALT IN PROGRESS, oh no Boo-Boo, we don't do dirty utensils. You will bring me another one like right freakin now! 4 min later a new fork arrives and I eat the rest of my lukewarm bowl. Across the table she barely eats about 1/4 of her bowl. Now keep in mind she's not inexperienced at Mongolian BBQ, she's ate it in 6 states, multiple different places too, and for her to only eat 1/4 of her bowl...ugh. I ask for her opinion, and she's nice and says it's \"ok\". Then I ask about how they compare to BD's and she's like this place sucks compared to them. Enough said. So after getting one more offer to buy an overpriced dessert we get our check. With an 18% tip it's almost $29 for 2 people to have lunch. Choking back that I just got seriously ripped off feeling I signed the check and headed for the door.   I did tell the staff that things have improved (Hey, they didn't spill something at the table this time so I was being honest!) But 45 min later I began to get sick. Did you know that from Pecos and Sunset to Sunset and I-515 there are 4 Terribles locations with bathrooms? I can now give reviews on 2 out of those 4 thanks to Genghis Grill's food. What's worse is when 2 people have urgent needs to use the same bathrooms. They need bigger restroom facilities that can handle more than 1 person at a time. There's also a great CVS pharmacy close to the Fox 5 studios on Sunset that sells Imodium tablets that kept our Friday from being an ode to Charmin type day.   I'm sorry but 1 Star is where this crappy place stays, and it gets bumped to my Call the Health Department list as my stomach still hurts almost 24 hours later.  Edit:  1: I know how to SERIOUSLY stack. And I still feel the bowls are way too small compared to their competitors offerings.  2: The sauces suck, period. I will mix my own sauces, I don't need someone to do it for me. And as for the product they've dumped out there for people to use, I can get better stuff at Vons off the shelf.  3: Pricing even with sales tax variations is still higher when compared with Denver, Kansas City, and Minneapolis. How do I know? I just got off the phone after calling and asking and comparing it against the receipt I have in my hand.  4: If the Clark County Health Dept wasn't in such disarray of late I'd walk in a complaint in person on Monday since I'll be downtown. Might just do it anyway. An inspection would do this place some good. Buying Imodium after the fact should NOT be part of my lunch time costs. People can squawk all they want but restaurant food should not make multiple people sick after it's consumed. And there's not a critic on here that should question that.   I take these reviews with the utmost seriousness as I learned from Chef Gio at Old School Pizzeria that these reviews have impact. These reviews can make or even break a business. I don't write 1 star reviews for spite, I simply call it as I experience it.",

You get a bowl and are able to fill it up with as much meat and veggies you want at the bar/station. You also pick your spices the sauce and the starch. The food is practically cooked in front of you (if you hang around the grill). The price is very affordable and if you want all you can eat its an extra $3.  There was a fundraiser taking place durning our visit and even though it was busy the service was relatively fast. I'm looking forward to going again.",

    "text": "The only two things I miss about living in Michigan are BD's and Flat Top Grill.  I have literally rerouted airplane trips to have layovers in Chicago and Dallas so I can run out for a bowl.  Thus I watched the construction of Genghis with baited breath and high fived the lord for putting it two blocks from my office.  For years, I got stirfry once or twice a week because one bowl lasts two meals (am I right, pro-stackers?!)  Sadly, it's been eight trips so far, and the place is still not quite right.  I will absolutely keep eating there, but I always tell them honestly when they ask how my visit was, and many of the frequent irritations seem easy to fix!  (Watch out, TL;DR coming!)  THE BAD:  1) The habitual mistake I see every time is how the grillers dump the bowl and walk away.  I have even watched my pile sit still until it's time to sauce.  The word \"stir\" in \"stir fry\" should have been on Day One of training, guys.  Move that shit around!   Aside from the performance aspect (which is supposed to be one of the selling features), it prevents food from burning itself to the grill, and flaking charred remains into my meal.  When you watch them plate your bowl, you see a thin black layer of food lost to the grill, which wouldn't happen if they kept the piles moving.  I cringe to think how much wasted food is hauled out of that trap every night.  At BD's the guys rotate around the grill, so every pile gets flipped a few times.  There's a fine line between leaving it long enough to brown, and ignoring it so long it burns.  I lose half my crab every meal because it's left behind, blackened to the grill.  STIR!  MORE!  2) The guys who designed the buffet dimensions suck and the store owners should demand a do-over.  I imagine it's hard to think of every body size and ability, but the back row is so far behind the sneeze guard, I literally have to bend over and press my shoulder against the rail to stretch far enough.  For a while, they had a guy back there handing you the unreachables.  Considering how much shrimp I eat, I sympathize with their tactics ... but the message is clear when they have two rows of fish and the shrimp in back: They don't want you eating it!  I've gone at 4:00 and the scallops weren't out yet, so I can only imagine they somehow create an additional barrier.  Portion it out in plastic cups if the cost is killing you!  3) The cooks need improvement for reading the card instructions, something time will fix I hope.  I have asked for rice on the side, and it was mixed.  I have asked for an extra sauce cup and they told me I have to ask my server.  I walked five feet over and grabbed it myself from the station.  I have asked for my bowl to go, and they handed me a plate.  I have gotten a bowl to go, and they handed me a To Go box sitting on a plate.  I ended up walking over to the server station and bagging it myself.  Rookie moves, guys!  4) The appetizers are disappointing.  Twice I have ordered appetizers and they arrived after my bowl.  The citrus salt is too strong on the edamame.  The lettuce gets soggy when you pour all the meat over all the lettuce.  Some lettuce should be on the side so it can stay crisp -- pouring hot meat and sauce on lettuce equals limp cooked lettuce for the last half of the dish!  THE GOOD:  1) After a few rough trips, we wrote an email listing our problems and the manager invited us back for a free meal.  Gold star response!  2) I pay $9 for Teriyaki Madness, and can get Genghis To Go in the same time for a dollar more -- but I get all the \"Surf N Turf\" I can stack.  I eat half for lunch and the rest for dinner.  Anyone who complains about the size of the bowls isn't doing it right and/or expecting the business to lose money.  I punish the Station Buffets like anyone else, but stand-alone restaurant owners walk a razor thin margin.  There's plenty of food and money for us all to go home happy and full, folks.  3) My friends and I have gotten diabolical with the game of stacking over the years.  My personal best involves tucking snowpeas along the rim to create a retaining wall, and pressing the meat down with a broccoli floret (don't use the tongs, because someone might be allergic to something else touched in your bowl.)  We are easily amused.  ;-)",

You can decide between 10 or so different types of meat, then go on to season them accordingly. After you move on to the vegetables and believe me you want to stack them as high as you can. Finally they offer you about 15 different choices of sauces as well as a few different starches such as rice, noodles etc. The bowls come out steaming hot and delicious. For those who are more bold they offer an endless bowl in which you can go up and refill as many times as you want. Overall this place is awesome, both food and service are excellent.",

The waitstaff I hope makes more than a typical waiter or waitress because they don't really have to do anything so I can't imagine they make much in tips. They have started placing workers behind the food to keep everything full and clean. However I will admit that seeing all that open raw meat that people are grabbing themselves with tongs makes me a bit nervous. There's lots of opportunity for cross contamination, and for bacteria to grow on the meats and veggies. My recommendation would be to have the employees dish the meat for you. Other than that, it's been good every time I've gone.",

    "text": "So why would you beat up on a brand new place. obviously these are younger folks just trying to make money by starting here and you folks just throw them under the bus. This is not rocket science  but they do have some highly edumacated folks there. Yes they are a chain but yes this is new store. The concept is sound, the food is fresh and clean and only bad because you cant figure out how to season it. That is the whole concept. I sit at full service bar and am treated like king with my named asked for and used several times. Drink and food club stuff avail. All you can eat for 14.00 is cheap. If you dont know how to fill one bowl to the max and dont understand how meat shrinks when you cook it then pay the extra 3 bucks cheapass. I have been waiting for good Mongo since that place went TU on Flamingo near UNLV.  Give these guys a chance, ask questions the first time you are there, they will gladly help you out. Most of all give immediate common sence feedback on table size and such so they can at least look into improveing your crummy little life experience. Dont just go once, like it but whine about it!",

    "text": "Finally tried it. Its a bit on the pricey side and they try their hardest to slow you down so you don't eat that much and up sell all the expensive appetizers and fancy drinks. They bring you these little dinky bowls to put your stuff in, which when cooked will amount to about 1/2 chinese food take out container. Have to get the all you can eat, or you'll starve to death from lack of food. They have way too many employees working at one time, they could get rid of about half of them and still run the place efficiently and maybe drop the bowl a buck or two, however the waitress we had was friendly, informative & helpful. The format is awkward at best compared to all the rest of the Mongolian BBQ's I have been to across the nation as they try to make this a restaurant experience & show instead of a Mongolian BBQ. It gets extremely crowded during the dinner hours and extremely loud, so crowded your practically bumping elbows with the party next to you. When you get up 3 tables have got to slide out of your way so you can squeeze through the little 4 inches in between tables (little over done, but you get the point). Kinda curious why they put on a \"fire show\" when they want you to sit down after giving them your bowl, you cant see it due to the booths and the yelling and gonging is kinda annoying.  If your tall like me, expect a workout to get anything under the sneeze guards. This place must of been designed by midgets (no offense to midget architects). The meats are average and they have a fair selection of veggies, but the sauces are either too sugary or too salty and unusually thick (like molasses) and its hard to fine tune to taste especially for heat. Don't listen to them when they say their sauces are hot. I dumped a ton of their real hot one (Khanzu Sauce) and it barely spiced it at all, and their powdered spices don't do much either.  But all said, I can make a fairly tasty bowl and that's why we came. Roommate really liked the Curry Peanut Sauce.  If I was on this side of town, and wanting Mongolian \"style\" BBQ, I would visit again. I figure I'll get the sauces down eventually, but it is definitely not worth a special trip or traveling from afar like from the Strip or Summerlin.  Well see if this place survives (which I doubt), its WAY too expensive for what you get.",

The fact that you get to choose all your toppings, seasoning, sauce and starch, as someone else mentioned, if it's not good you can really only blame yourself. They even have little cards that show u what things to add to make a certain type of bowl. So if you wanted a teriyaki chicken bowl you would include chicken, broccoli, pineapple, teriyaki sauce and your choice of rice. The card has the calories on there as well so If you follow the recipe you can estimate about how many cals your taking in. I made a really tasty Thai chicken Bowl with their spicy peanut sauce and udon noodles and it was really good. My only gripe was there was not enough sauce so it was a little dry which was my own fault. The server was friendly and attentive and we left full. The only thing i can say negative was right by the bathrooms there was this rank smell coming from I guess the kitchen area. Makes you wonder what's really going on.",

    "text": "First off, this place is good. The selection of meats are really unequivocally vast. You get get sausage, pepperoni, pork, beef, chicken, and for dinner scallops. You are prompted to start with a protein after getting your bowl from the hostess stand. From the meat stand you proceed to dry seasoning which I did not really notice in the end product because the final sauces you add to your separate sauce cup are so viscous they overpower the dry seasoning. After seasoning you pick your vegetable, of which there are many. They the afore mentioned sauces a next. There are again, many from which to choose, all made in house. They were good but they are very thick and slightly off putting. With your bowl piled high you walk up to the counter and select your starch, rice in several iterations and 2 noodle choices. I like that they add to starch so you do not have to cram it in the bowl. Now the service. The hostess as someone mentioned was slow to appear and when she did she walked up to us with her head down and was writing something for like 2 mins before she acknowledged us, it was rather rude. We did have a good waitress though, how hard is bringing drinks? Also, the wait staff were rather chatty with each other and their giggling was sort of annoying and it seemed to take precedence over my food waiting at the counter being delivered to me.  In fact I was with someone and they and already gotten their food and were full into eating before my meal came, though it was ready.  They do have a full bar and many different specialty drinks on their menu. I can for lunch though and I have no need to be bagged in the middle of the day. Bottom line, the place was good and I will be back to see if they improve or deteriorate. Hopefully they will be better next time and I can give a better rating because they have a potential for a great rating.",

    "text": "Okay so this place is not a restaurant you want impress your first dinner date with, but the loud, spirited stir fryers who cook up your Mongolian BBQ dish exhibition style (fire & all)  makes it a chill place you want to get together with your family and friends.  It's a AYCE joint.  There's a salad bar type area where you build and create your stir fry dish. Reminds me of the buffet part of Fiesta, but here you have more choices.   Ambiance - Contemporary design, casual atmosphere, the tables were a little squished in and noisy from everyone talking so loud that busy body me knows what's up in your life cause I can hear your convo. heh heh.   Service - Was greeted and seated right away....which was surprising considering it was super busy.  Our server Janine did great  She always checked up on us, kept our drinks filled and kept us up on the status of food which was being prepared. I didn't feel that our server offering us appetizers was \"up selling\" whatsoever, it's like at the burger place asking if you want fries with that? Just say no thanks that's all if ya dont want any.   Food - All the ingredients appeared fresh, the meats were cold, I didn't see any meats that were soaking in their juices that I had read in some reviews. (believe me I would've just left if I saw that)  The veggie choices were also at cold temps and were crisp.  The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the noodles I chose the first time around.  My husband really liked Udon noodles  though.   So the second round I passed on starches and loaded up on tofu, veggies, lil bit of beef, 2 seasonings, cilantro, skipped up on the starches and got a lettuce wrap instead. When I tried my second bowl of stir fry I was pleasantly surprised at my creation it turned out pretty good! My suggestion, skip the salt and  ease up on the sauces.  You dont want to drown out your dish with more than 1/2 a cup of sauce. It might end up being too salty or too sweet taking way the flavor of your dish instead of enhancing it.  Hence that \"tiny\" cup of sauce should be more than enough.  Or check out the little card recipes as your guide. That's your safest bet on your meal turning out good.  Both my husband and I liked our food creations and we enjoyed our first dining experience here.",

A nice selection of proteins to pick from, one glaring issue, while its great to see them offering shrimp, they still have the vein in, not the first time I have seen this, but still not something I would eat.  Service has been good, waiter is very friendly, though my diet coke went MIA for a while.  I will say there is a large selection sauces to go on the food and they ask about allergy problems, of course selecting your own food to be cooked it should take care off this issue.  So the food has arrived, I guess I know how to pick good ingredients as it was pretty good. Some of the food was a little burnt, but all in all it was a good meal and certainly good for $11.  Gourmet it is not, but it doesn't pretend to be, it delvers as advertised to I am happy.  The waiter passed the empty glass test, it was quickly refilled.  So all in all, a good deal, good food, the shrimp thing bothers me though.",

    "text": "My first impression wasn't very good.  I have been to many of the mongolian grills before and find they use frozen meats both killing taste and making your bowl look full but really on the thin side as the meat doesn't bend to make room in the bowl.  The restaurant atmosphere is essentially a cafeteria, not designed for comfort but rather to cram as many people into the restaurant as possible.  The concept is fun and my daughter loved it.  Grab your bowl and get in line, as you progress you choose your protien from shrimp, scallops, pork, chicken, beef, sausage, pepperoni, etc.  Then your spice including salt and pepper, cajun, etc.  You can mix spices. Then your veggies and there is a wide selection.  Finally your sauce, again you can mix and they even recommend some mixing.  They have sweet sauces for the kids and spicy ones for the adult kids :)    Then it is off to the cooking station to pick your starch from various rice and noodle options and then watch them stir fry your meal on the round grill.  I have to say the food was excellent.  The ingredients were fresh and not frozen, the flavor was great and the sauces were tasty.  The best thing is it is a bottomless bowl for an extra 2.95 (free for kids) so you can eat as much as you want.  We will be back soon!",

If you don't come with someone who has experienced this place before, you could wind up skimping yourself on your meal. You are responsible for either building your dream bowl, or you can select from a few recommended templates. But, if you don't take into consideration that your meal will shrink drastically once it is fully cooked, your overstuffed precooked bowl comes to your table cooked and barely half the size it was before. I've even stacked to the point of carrying my bowl to the cooking station covering the edges with my hands to keep it all in and still got back a very small cooked portion.  All in all, the food tastes great, better yet, awesome, you just don't get a lot of bang for your buck and it's a pretty steep buck. But I give them brownie points for serving Coke Zero!",

I am a huge fan of stir fry and was willing to give it a try.   Overall it was not bad, I just have an issue with a few items. One, the bowl that they give you is not that large. Even the best of stackers will have issues with getting the most veggies packed into that tiny half sphere. Two, for the $11 it is not worth it, but adding an additional $3 for unlimited is a decent value. Three, the scallops are not worth it. I know, you should never expect decent scallops, but these baby ones are tough after cooking. It felt like I was chewing on rubber.  The service was friendly and my server offered me a new bowl without judgment. I have had better experiences with Mongolian BBQ.",

I looked up big eatery spots locally rather than the strip because Vegas is known internationally for their food. Genghis Grill came highly recommended by the locals. I went in around lunchtime and got the large bowl. I love this semi-buffet-ness of picking out your own portions of proteins and veggies and then having them cooked up in your face Benihana style with your choice of starch.(If this place would had more protein choices, I would have gave this place 5 stars) You're responsible for your portions, sauces and seasoning so, if it doesn't taste good, you got nobody to blame but yourself. When getting your bowl cooked up by the chefs, give 'em at least of couple dollars so they cook your food more thorough with love. You even get to get your own drinks, so if you're thirsty....again blame yourself. Service was friendly and decent. You get up and do everything yourself so they're minimal anyways in your experience. For basically $20 I got to eat 2 meals in one day and had more money and time left to play the tables. Definitely have a good game plan when you come in here to maximize your bowl. I like to stack proteins then veggies on top of each other in that order. Good eats and experience.",

Everything came out bland. The udon noodles tasted like spaghetti so my first bowl tasted like a wanna be Asian pasta dish. I tried a second bowl to see If maybe I did something wrong. I spiced the crap out of the meat with the dry ingredients and filled the little ramekin up with the sauces I thought would go well and tried rice. It came out bland and kinda tasted like the first bowl. It was just a horrible experience. I will not go back.",

    "text": "I work in the food industry so I completely understand how much a bad review can hurt a business. I hate to contribute to it, but what happened on my last visit was completely unacceptable.  I came in on Tuesday and went thru the line, packed my bowl full of food that I knew were with in my dietary restrictions. I have a severe gluten intolerance, and I knew that genghis was good about listing ingredients and giving out special tickets based on dietary restrictions, which is what got me excited about going to eat there. when I got to the cooking station I told them about my intolerance and I got the special blue ticket making it know to the staff. as I was eating my food, (my base of which was white steamed rice) I kept pulling wheat noodle after  wheat noodle out of my mouth. I was very very upset. I told the waitress, without trying to be to rude but still trying to get my point across, she was really nice and went and told a manager, but I heard nothing after that. The manager never came over to me, and nothing was done about my food. I still had to pay 12 dollars for a meal that made me sick afterwards. Things like this can NOT happen if your goal is to make allergies a priority in the restaurant. I have no interest in coming back.",

Our waitress did a great job explaining how to order and how the build your bowl works.   I picked out chicken with a bunch of vegetables, and chose spicy soy sauce. The grill cook was very friendly and gave us suggestions. I went with brown rice and udon noodle. I doubt I will be getting the udon again  the brown rice was very good. They let you take your leftovers home so pile high and you can have lunch for tomorrow!  Overall it was great, it left me wanting to try more. We will be back here again. If you like the Mongolian grill at buffets, this is like that but 10x better. I would recommend stopping in here for a meal.",

    "text": "Create your own mountain of a bowl filled with your favorite meats and veggies, then have it cooked to perfection by their Grill Masters!  This Mongolian style restaurant has over 80 delicious ingredients to choose from.  First you'll pick a bowl size, small, regular, or large.  I find it absolutely impossible to eat an entire large bowl, and rarely will I get through a regular.  If you are absolutely famished, I think you'd be fine with a regular if you pile it high!  You'll have the opportunity to pack the bowl with whatever meats and veggies you prefer.  My personal favorite is as follows: Sliced beef, chicken, and crab meat.  I'll add some pineapples, green peppers, tomatoes, and baby corn.  Then I'll add more meat to the top to create a pyramid of goodness.  As for the sauces, there are a plethora to choose from.  I elect to do 1/2 sweet n sour and 1/2 island teriyaki.  Once you drop your bowl and sauce at the counter to be prepared, you'll circle what sides you want.  I personally like 2x Udon Noodles and brown rice.  You can choose from tortillas, fried rice, steamed rice, etc.  Once you've completed your order they will prepare it there right before your eyes.  The prices vary from lunch to dinner.  Lunch prices are $9 small, $10 regular, $13 large Monday-Friday 11am-4pm. If you'd like to come for dinner after 4pm, prices are $10 small, $12.25 regular, and $15 large.  This place is located on the complete opposite side of town from me, but I always try to stop by when I'm in the area.  Not only do they have great food, but a full bar as will with signature cocktails, beer and wine.",

Staff was all friendly and helpful as usual, but the bowl \"bar\" where you build your bowl was VERY understocked. Several items were low, and a few items  weren't even available, broccoli, snap peas, sprouts, mushrooms for example, weren't available. When we asked about this, the lady restocking what they did have just said they didn't have it and that was that. I later heard one of the cooks telling someone else that the produce provider had been price gauging or something and they had caused the issue. Only a couple members of the wait staff even knew they didn't have a few items, and we weren't aware of it until part way through adding items to our bowls.  Ownership and/or management needs to be on top of situations like this, and informing staff so staff can let customers know. Either go buy produce at Costco or a grocery store so you can provide it, or let it be known you don't have it.",

Went to the bar which had lots of meat choices including steak, chicken and fish. Meat was the  first stop too, so we could pile it on! Yum! Added some spices (maybe a little too many), veggies and sauce. It was so fun!!! Handed it off to the cooking station and our server brought out the cooked portion. After adding the rice (my startch choice), the bowl became huge! Lol I had to use two to-go containers to take home my leftovers!",

    "text": "I'm so glad businesses are going up near where I live, instead of places a bit far out. I like Genghis Grill especially because I can choose exactly what I want in my bowl and I don't have to say I want this, but hold that.  I decide!    When you're seated, empty bowls are brought to you and you fill it up with whatever you want- meats vegetables, spices and you pour sauce into the little cup, take it to the counter, tell them what kind of starch you want, then wait for your concoction.  I must say, my creation was good the first time around.    Our server was very helpful in telling my family how the whole process works, and he took them to the line to show them.  He also checked back with us several times, to see how we liked the food.  One night we went for my mom's birthday and he gathered other fellow employees and they sang to her.    They have mini machines at the table where you can order from. They can be helpful as they eliminate the wait time of the server standing there while you decide what drink to order, or whatever the case may be.  When you're ready, enter it on the tablet.  When I came with a friend, drinks were ordered and our guy still came out to see who ordered what and to check ID's.    I only have one objection.  While going through the line, food droppings sit on the counter and on the floor.  And not like there's a bit here a bit there, it's all the way down the line.  I guess that's to be expected, but if the employees did a clean sweep every now and then, the counter would look so much better.  All in all, I love eating here, and I've only been here twice.  The price isn't bad at all, considering that you can pile high for cheap.  My meal was less than $11 and I went home satisfied.  You can get endless for a few bucks more.  Lunch price isn't a break in the bank either.  If you get a Genghis card and rack up points, you get a free bowl on the 10th point (bowl).  Also, on your birthday you get a free bowl!  I'll be back!",

First of all let me start of with the AWESOME server Luke, he explained the menu items, took his time and answered all our many questions with no problem. Luke was really the best thing about this place. After Luke explained the menu we then stood in a long line of people waiting to fill there bowls. There was nothing stocked up, no chicken, beef and many other items, no trays etc. So of course the line was long. There was one worker bringing out one item at a time, plus he was dealing with a large crowd of customers waiting. We waited for 15-20 min or longer just to fill our bowls. I then asked to speak with the manager, that never came to address me but instead made a general statement \"saying it would be a few minutes\" after we already had been waiting over 15 min in a long line. I figured most managers would jump in and help there employees but not this manager. I kinda felt bad for the ypung man behind the counter taking all the abuse. As Im typing this comment, Ive still have not eaten but of course there behind on cooking the bowls. What a mess they have going on here on a Saturday. I suggest that the general manager step in and make some well needed changes because good and bad reviews make a difference in this city.",

The waiter came around just twice during the whole meal and couldn't answer basic questions about the size of the bowls (which were all different shapes, which made it hard to figure out how much they held). This was also the only location I've seen where people have to get their own drinks; if I'm getting my own drinks and my own food, what am I tipping for?   The food bar was well-stocked, but as I was eating the shredded beef in my dish, I kept finding bones in my food. It happened twice, and it was really gross.   I definitely won't be back.",

My sister and I got our food and after almost finishing it halfway the last person in the group was still waiting for there food even though the large party that came in way after us were already getting their food. After finally seeing my server (who barely checked on us in the beginning). I let her know she was missing a plate and finally brought it right after. Even after having all of that happen I still would have came back, but what upset me the most is she was pressuring us to leave. She brought us the check and boxes even though the the last person in our party had just started eating. We knew she just wanted us to leave even though she had another table. She came over and opened the check book and asked if we can pay already because she wanted to start closing out. She stood there and watched us take out money to pay. I couldn't understand why she was rushing us out if the large party was still taking their time eating and taking photos. I don't think I'll ever go back. I'm a server and I would never push for guest to leave. Or watch them pay and leave a tip. Don't know our servers name, but she was a red head who served us on feb 18 around 9. Watch you hire. Servers like that push guest away.",

He apologized for the food and I appreciated his apology.  He asked me if I wanted a discount and I told him I did not go to their restaurant looking for a discount and that all I wanted was a decent meal. To be honest, I was a bit insulted when he asked me if I wanted a discount. I paid for our full meal although we were not able to eat the food at all. Definitely not coming back to this place...",

I made a comment about the dirty bowl I was handed and Kelly, if that's her name, said I could grab another bowl from the next table. The cutlery and bowls were not clean. So, since I made one comment, the whole entire staff was informed and I felt uncomfortable. I decided to watch my food being cooked and apparently this is unwelcome as well. Then, surprisingly after the cook dumped my food into the serving bowl, he sneezed into his elbow which unfortunately was near my bowl. I followed the person carrying my bowl. The man said, \"Who do you have? Good luck\" Wow. Okay.  I couldn't even eat at this point. Sam came to the table because my daughter explained what had happened. Sam is apparently the manager and he made the comment. He apologized and gave me a card for a free bowl next visit. No thanks   This is generic Mongolian BBQ. If you don't mind dirty utensils and bowls, immature staff, cooks that sneeze in your food, and subpar food that costs more than it should then this place won't disappoint. But, if you care about cleanliness please  save yourself the trouble and just go somewhere else if you're hungry. This was a very unpleasant experience.",

All the staff were very attentive, my waiter Brett was friendly and checked in on me almost a little too much. Seriously though I received much better service here than I have at some of the premier restaurants on the strip.   The food area was regularly cleaned and restocked. All the food was fresh looking and cooked thoroughly. Lots of choices when it came to meats, veggies and the sauces.  Only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was that when giving my uncooked bowl of food to grill master to cook, he asked what starch I wanted and I said brown rice.  When my food was cooked and delivered to me though, udon noodles had been given to me instead of brown rice.  I am not a picky eater and I was hungry and had dived right in. It actually took me a few bites to realize the error.  I'm not one to complain or send things back unless it's really a grievous error and I didn't want to go through the process of collecting everything again and waiting for it to be cooked so I just shrugged it off and kept on eating.  Big screen TV in there was nice as well as I dined alone tonight.   Dinner bowls are $10.99 + drinks (alcohol is avail). You can pay $3 extra for a bottomless (all you can eat) bowl, but honestly if you pile your first bowl high enough, only football players in training should need to go back for seconds.  I will come back again",

    "text": "Genghis Grill has it all wrong. If I was from Po-dunkville, Arkansas this would be my idea of Mongolian grilling or healthy stir fry. Since it's the shiny, new restaurant in my neighborhood I thought I would give it a whirl. Plus I had to re balance my Yelp chi since my numbers were 210 and 110 and some poor soul wanted to be my friend so it went to 211 screwing it up.   INITIAL IMPRESSION: Too many tables in too small of a space. They tried to seat us in between six full tables while the rest of the areas were open. Not gonna happen homey. Also the lighting is too bright. All good, I bet the food and service is amazing. Hahahaha.  SERVICE:  Service was too much yet it fucking sucked. No one understood what Happy Hour was and they effed up every part of my order accept for the bowl I fucking made.  Every time I had a bite in my mouth they would ask me a question. I did not have a chance to relax and enjoy my meal, yet ever five seconds someone was on my nuts about the experience. Overattentive, yet they still managed to mess up our drink and appetizer orders. Things that make you go hmmmm.     FOOD: For a second just envision raw chicken pieces swimming in it's chicken juice. Then you are expected to scoop a bowl of the meat and slime and mix it in the same bowl with your raw veggies and egg. WTF?! Maybe my OCD was just kickin, but it felt wrong and I couldn't do it. Yes, I'm a complicated order bitches. Thanks for reminding me and making a scene about it.  Big effin deal when I asked for a separate bowl for my veggies and egg. The manager came over to talk to me (without an extra bowl in hand mind you) and give me the Stir Fry For Dummies lecture about how it all ends up in the same place anyways. Do I look like a fucking Mongoloid to you Manager man? News Flash Fuck Face: You lost your stir fry credentials when I peeped meatballs and pepperoni on the line so ba-bye. They do have tons of veggies, eggs, seasonings (mostly seasoned salts) and a variety of sauces (high in sugar) to choose from. If you were from the moon or live off of Hamburger Helper you would think you are having a healthy meal and be super proud of yourself. I wish they would offer healthier choices like raw garlic, ginger and low sodium and sugar free sauces to their selections for those of us who know and watch. They do have brown rice so they get a couple snaps for that.  What whacked out Mongolian Grill place also has spaghetti and burritos?! Genghis does and not in a hipster trendy sorta way either. Penn and Teller would definitely call BULLSHIT. The atmosphere was that of a circus or kid's pizza joint with seven screaming men around the grill taking turns lighting fires and banging on the steel drum. The only way that would work for me is if they were topless with six packs, blue eyes and dancing a little. I'd be throwin hundreds, hundreds.  I found the entire experience to be stressful instead of enjoyable and even though the food wasn't too bad it certainly wasn't worth the price or the extra sugar and calories. An hour later my stomach hurt.   Genghis, you get 2 STARS because I'd rather see your fake stir fry place than a 99 Cent store in my hood any day.",

    "text": "Hmm, reviews seem a bit lukewarm and I can't really figure out why. These guys offer everything you could need or want in a decent mongolian grill (and much more) and I've been pleased each time I ate here.  It's interesting inside. They have a small bar to prepare various well and specialty drinks if you feel the need to get buzzed whilst chowing down on mongolian food. As a previous reviewer noted, it's not particularly comfortable inside-- seems more like a cafeteria style lay out rather than an intimate dining area but I imagine that this style probably fits the casual experience of preparing your own concoction for dinner. They are very friendly here and are more than happy to explain the process to the uninitiated. The availability of healthier options such as low carb or brown rice is certainly a plus for the health conscious.  Now for the food. It's actually quite overwhelming to a mongolian bbq fan like myself because you really don't know where the start. In addition to over half a dozen different meat options, there are many optional spices and far more vegetables than you know what to do with. Plenty of non-authentic options are included, such as as mexican and teriyaki flavors. They have some pre-set recipes for you to follow that will probably make your time in line a lot easier, but being as stubborn as I am, I somehow believe that I can make my bowl more delicious through my own creativity.  You can add a decent amount of meat and they won't complain if it isn't ridiculously excessive.  They add plenty of rice and if you flavored your entree well enough, you don't even require any additional soy or chili sauce. It's not the best mongolian I've ever had but its conveniently located, filling, and served in a friendly manner. What's not to like?",

However, about a year later, they opened this location.  I could not wait for it to open.  Normally, I try to wait about a month to try newly opened places, just to weed out bad staff, service, etc.  However, I had to go right away.  Right away I was rather disappointed at some of the changes they implemented.  But the food was good and the service was decent.  However, subsequent visits have yielded sub par service.  The past three times I've been there, the make-your-own-bowl bar has been a mess.  They were out of a few things.  They had discontinued shrimp due to issues with their supplier.  I have been very disappointed with this location.  The positives are still the food is great and fresh.  It is a really good deal.  And you can eat as healthy or as unhealthy as you want here.",

    "text": "Read a few of the negative reviews below and felt like I had to respond.  First of all if you limit yourself to the size of the bowl then of course you will leave hungry.  However if you know how to stack your bowl properly you will not only leave full but will have enough left over for another meal.  There are several GG in Az and my husband and I ate there A LOT when we lived in Phx.  I always took it as a personal challenge to see how high I could pile my bowl.  I've gotten it so high before that they had to serve it to me in two of their red bowls.  So if you leave the GG hungry its because you barely put anything in the bowl, and yes veggies do shrink.  As far as the Mongolian BBQ thing... Its not a mongolian BBQ its a grill.  Its very similar to any other Mongolian grill ive ever been to with the exception of the high quality meats they have at the GG.  So pretty much its up to you how your food tastes because you make your own sauce.  I have been a regular at the GG for years(granted not this location) and have always left happy and full.  I was very excited to see one here in Las Vegas and after dining there I can say they did not disappoint.  The service was fantastic, the staff was friendly, and the manager came out several times to check on us.  I think this place is def worth a stop.  Be sure to try and figure out how to maximize your tiny bowl.  A little creative stacking goes a long way!",

I am very set on what I create (Steak, carrots, pasta, bbq sauce in a tortilla) and this place always satisfies my craving.  Becoming a member of the rewards club gets you very nifty discounts.  One time I paid $24 for an app, two soft drinks, two bowls and dessert!  The only downside on my past few visits has been the service.  Anytime this place gets busy it seems like the service goes down hill.  I seem to never get my tortillas with my bowl and the wait staff has inconsistent.  I did notice they added a Coca-Cola refresh machine which gives you the option to get your own drink so you are never thirsty.  4-stars manly because of the food!",

The first visit was only a couple days after they opened and it seemed like it was not only everyone's first couple days at this location, but everyone's first day in the restaurant business. I wouldn't have called anything bad, but it just seemed like everyone was very new at their jobs.  The food was not my favorite among Mongolian bbq style restaurants I have been to. After two more visits, I think I have it ironed out. I was used to having many liquid sauces and flavorings at the end of the buffet line where here the majority of the flavoring takes place near the beginning of the line with dry spices. The spices are served with very tiny spoons so I did not take as much as I should which resulted in the final product being quite bland. After adjusting my seasonings, everything really seems to be clicking.  On my last visit, I had a delicious, well cooked meal and great service. This place is on it's way up and worth a try, especially since it is the only restaurant of this type that I know of in Las Vegas.",

Only open a few days the service was well trained which was surprising. You can order appetizers and desserts but the main attraction is the BBQ.  After giving you two silver dishes you fill the larger one with your meats and seafood and then load it up with vegetables.  Be sure to add a lot of them as they will cook down quite a bit.  Next you fill the small bowl with your choice of flavor sauces with everything from flavorful to spicy.  After this you take your bowls to the BBQ where you have your choice of rices, noodles, pasta and even surprisingly tortillas.  You can watch them cook up your own concoction or they will deliver it to your table.    Our experience wasn't perfect. Our drink was watery and for some reason they said they were out of edamame appetizers which considering they had been open only two days seemed like the had few bugs to work out.    Overall we plan on going back soon.  While not cheap the meal was tasty, filling and served piping hot.",

The food is traditional Mongolian BBQ in that you get a small bowl which you skillfull try to stuff as much ingredients into then have them cook it for you either over noodles or rice. Sauce included or on the side. The sides are good I love that they have bok choy  which you dont often see on many Mongolian BBQ's. They try hard to keep the area clean and usually succeed. The only complaint I have is that maybe the people cooking need a lil more training.. sometime the food sits a lil too long on the grill .. just my preference I suppose..  Its decent..

I felt they had adequate number of choices there.  The quality of selection looked and tasted good.  Once you make your choices, you walk up to the grill where your selection of food combined with your choice of Starch (Rice/Fried Rice/Udon Noodles/Pasta) is cooked on a large grill.  It is fun to sense (both watch and smell) your food while it is being cooked.  Outside of food quality, the place has lot of information to offer you through their large labels/signs posted all around on walls.  Waiting staff is young and friendly.  It is a hands-on dining experience. Do not expect a white glove service.    The Bad: You got to ask for second bowl ($2 additional) if you feel like going for a second time around the food station and have more food cooked for you.  Problem is not with additional $2, but to reach out and ask the waiter for a second bowl.  You don't want any wait times or that wicked you-eat-a-lot smirk on your waiter's face while you are on a food quest like one real Genghis. Do you?",

It USED to be healthy, good tasting food. I would come two to four times a week.  The first couple months were great. But, as time went on, the food quality declined further and further. I went today (for my last time) and saw the garbage they were passing off as \"marinated steak\". It looked like meat slop one step away from the pink slime chicken that McDonalds supposedly used. It tasted about as good as it looked, slimy, gritty, and just plain disgusting.  It seems they've thinned out their sauces too, they used to be a lot thicker.  Anything to save a buck, right?  I guess that's how it is nowadays, you get them in the door early with good food and service, but once you're \"established\" you can pull the plug and hope they keep coming? Who are they kidding. I'll just go somewhere else.  Now they have the self serve coke machines too. I don't mind it, the variety is great, but now it's just ridiculous that they even have servers. All the server does is bring me my bowl. And I supposed to tip? Might as well just make it counter service, since that's all it is anyways.",

    "text": "I went to Genghis Grill twice within the first 2 weeks of its grand opening.  It is a Mongolian BBQ restaurant with an unusually large number of meats, vegetables, rice, noodles, and sauces to choose from.  If it's your first time, your server will show you through the buffet.  You fill up a bowl with meats and vegetables, and a small cup with your sauces (which you can sample in the line), and hand it over to a grill cook for preparation.  Choose your starch - rice, noodles, etc. - and you can watch it being grilled and pick it up, or have your server bring it to you.  Pros: delicious IF you get the right flavor combination, and some of the best customer service I've had in a Las Vegas restaurant.  Cons: pricey!  The bowl for your selections is very small.  You will need some architectural skills to build up your bowl very high.  The problem is that the vegetables cook down, so your prepared BBQ winds up quite small, and it's even served in a special bowl to make it look like more food than it really is.  They are also stingy with starches.  On my most recent visit, I overdid the sauce - not their fault - but the result was so strong that it needed rice to mellow it out.  The stingy 1/2 cup serving isn't enough anyway.  I wound up taking it home and make a pot of rice, and enjoyed leftoovers.  Tip: I recommend going at lunchtime for the unlimited bowl option and just make small bowls until you figure out what flavor combination you like.  Lunch is much cheaper than dinner.  Another tip: sign up for their Khan Club.  It's free and you get good deals through email.",

Best thing to me, is that you get to put what veggies you personally like rather than other places where it's already prepped. Completely amazing",

Then we waited another 10 minutes for our server to appear. Then stood in line another 12 minutes to get the stuff for the grill. Our food was served after 15 minutes. We were gonna do bottomless but our server was nowhere to be found. When she finally showed up we were so annoyed with all the waiting that we just asked for the check instead. We wanted to be fair so we gave this place another chance. Went back on a Monday night, same story. Never coming back again. I can get the same quality of food with more efficient service somewhere else.",

    "text": "This place has an interesting concept but, from entering the restaurant to being seated to prepping food and waiting for it to be cooked seems like a lot of wasted time and money. First they should have you start at the line to order food then seat yourself after food order is in. Also based on my experience and working F&B operations for over a decade in fine dining you should not allow guest mess with raw food in this way based on cross contamination. They should have a couple of people based on a chipotle ordering line to put your food together. This would eliminate any type of cross contamination. Also this would look more professional as well put my mind at ease for health and safety purposes. They could then hand off food for chef to cook. Eliminate the person from seating guest because this made no sense. This company is obviously not local and they thought sense they are opening a location in Las Vegas makes so much sense to put in a bar. Well surprise a bar makes no sense in a place like this. You can offer beer and wine(sake) and probably make the same if not do better since you are devoted to having the ridiculous bar area. This place needs an overhaul and you need people in there who actually know the business of restaurants rather than some high schoolers who think they know how to run Food and Beverage. They will never be successful if this place isn't executed correctly. Also prices need to be adjusted meaning reduce by a dollar in everything including 2.79 for a soda give me a break you took the Chipotle model and are charging at a premium something that isn't even near the quality of chipotle. If you are going to rip off an idea than it needs to executed correctly. Do not think you can change the genre of food and do it the same way and think you can be more successful. Good luck I would think about trying this place if they would consider making some of these changes.",

The bill came and I was indeed charged for the dessert. Beware, don't go there until they start drug testing! Your money will be better spent anywhere else. They were once good, no more.

It is okay no big deal but what happened next was hard to believe. There was a full on fight between a male waiter and a waitress he was complaining about her messing up our bill for our table (we haven't gotten food yet). We were not even involved, he kept saying to the waitress \" you are an idiot\". So finally that's over and I hear from across the room from another waitress \" IS THAT A REAL DIRTY DIAPER\" the waiter then looks at her and looks at what is in his hand brings it to his nose and responds \"YES\". This was the same waiter who was in the fight with another waitress earlier. He then proceeds to toss the diaper in the trash. Yep you know where is this going and walks straight up to where the food Is prepared and picks up a plate of hot food and brings to our table (same hand that had the diaper). I had eyes on him the whole time and never went to wash his hands. We regretfully can never go back for this reason.",

First clue; this is not the place for me. When I go out to eat, it's because I don't want to cook. Second clue; the staff behind the food bar/prep area are completely uncommunicative. Not sure if they A) Had their personalities shot off in the war or B)Were hired as part of an anger-management half-way house's return to work program. Third Clue: The menu is not a menu. As the dining room staff had indicated, 'it's a guide'. Yah... You're going to want to devote about 30 minutes to studying the menu. Again, this is not the place for you if you don't want to cook today, or are actually hungry and wanting to eat anytime soon. Fourth Clue: The food station is gross. Raw chicken. Sitting in a bucket. Dripping across other buckets of food. Smells bad. At that moment, we decided we weren't just hungry, tired, and cranky; but that our actual health was at risk. So, we left and counted ourselves lucky for the decision to do so. If you decide to visit this place, make sure that your shots are up to date.",

    "text": "Well, I can see why they did not actually put Mongolian BBQ on the sign but like a few other reviews have put, they do say stir fry.... To say I am some sort of Mongolian BBQ snob is in no way True but I will say, living in Northern California you definitely get spoiled having some great Mongolian BBQ spots to go check out. Now please remember, when I say Mongolian BBQ place I am talking about bowls the size of buckets and that you fill with the thinly sliced meat and then have your boxing buddy beat the hell out of the meat so you can fit all the veggies and then create the mount Shasta of noodles on top and then flood the bowl with great sauces. That is what got our mouths watering when we say the sign for this place as well as the guy walking to his car in the parking lot talking about how amazing it was.   Perfect, we found a Mongolian place that the customers outside think is amazing.... Let me start by saying I would love to find out how often that guy eats spaghettio's for dinner because this place was the farthest thing from amazing. We were seated and given a menu, looking over it and seeing that one bowl is something like $10 plus $3 for all you can eat that should have been the red flag but then when the waitress brought our our pet food dishes I really should have known. We were handed 3 bowls if that is what you call them with some piece of paper that you have to pull some cirque stuff to hang onto. Let me explain these bowls, One is for your meat which is quite small and then the largest is for your veggies, now don't let the word largest fool you because it is far from that and they also give you this cup for sauce, it looks like the cups you get at chili's when you ask for a side of ranch. Really?? That just wont cut it for us saucy types.   Oh but Ray, the meat selection is the redemption.. Ha, sorry Mr. Genghis, the last time I check Peperoni and sausage sure as hell don't belong in Mongolian BBQ let alone a stir fry. Are you sure this isn't a pizza joint in disguise. I walked up to the meat and the chicken was floating in its own......well I'm not quite sure what that is that it is floating in but I know that it cant be good. I was so utterly disgusted by the choice we had just made to eat here but decided to give it a chance and move on down the line. Once you finish walking down the line you tell the guy at the grill what kind of noodles you want including spaghetti noodle... What the hell?!?!   So, by this time you have picked your ridiculous meat and your terrible veggies and filled your shot glass with sauce and handed it over to Brad the Mongolian Chef and you are counting on him to make it all better and well this is where the trip to Mongolia crash and burns literally, Burns. He dumps the bowls of goods on the burner and left it sitting there while they rang some crazy gong and damn near lit the place on fire. I guess it entertained the kids but while they are being entertained my food was charring.  I would much rather watch that guy skip around the grill turning my food while yelling ye-haw. That would definitely entertain me more since my food would be cooked correctly. Now for the biggest trick they attempt to pull, they have these bowls that are shaped like a piece of modern art that look gigantic but that is the one side the other sits about as high as the side of an inflatable raft in the ocean, if you are not sure what that is like just try it and you will see.   If you haven't figured out buy now, this is not a place that I would recommend and the fact that my wife and I both had terrible stomach pains that night after eating here guarantees we will never set foot back in this place and will definitely make sure our friends don't make the same mistake we did by thinking this was a Mongolian BBQ",

They got rid of their POS systems which as you sit down and eat, the cool thing about them is you can play games on it while you wait for the food to be cooked and not only that, you can pay with it and seperate the check by meals and such.. however you want it. They need to put that back, I think that was a great idea but one of the ladies told me no one liked it.. I don't know why. Love this place, will always be back for more!!!
