Our mom's order was also large. We all liked what we ordered....comfort food with a gastropub twist.   It's a great addition to MGM's dining options. Pub 1842 offers generous portions of comfort food at reasonable prices. It fits in between MGM's cheaper food court eateries and its upscale restaurants.",

I just think if I'm paying that much, I'm less likely to be eating pink slime. Either that, or I'm paying assloads for pink slime. Shudder at the thought.   Pub 1842's peanut butter crunch burger is weird in all the right ways with the PB being more savory than peanut buttery. The bacon jam & potato chips just make this thing. I ordered it well-done & it came to my table rare. They'd halved the burger for bf & I to share & he dug right in to the pink (nasty, nasty thoughts.) Five minutes later, I had a completely cooked patty & the grubbin' began. Fries portion: unnecessarily over-generous.   Add shrimp cocktail at $18 & a $4 diet coke & booyaw, brokey status! That's Vegas for you, baby!   Sweet blonde waitress. Cool beers on tap right at your table (which I recommended to my beer connoisseur buddy...he complained it was $22 of mostly foam in his pitcher. My bad.)",

    "text": "Let me first start off by saying that we are huge Michael Mina fans. We were absolutely in love with Sea Blue (every year we looked forward to a Las Vegas trip simply because of Sea Blue - The Chilean Sea Bass dish... when your lady friend is obsessed with a certain dish, you know it's THAT good!).  Michael Mina also owned Knobhill Tavern... had one of the best meals of my life there 2 years ago. I remember we even ordered seconds on a full belly. YUM!  Unfortunately Sea Blue has now been replaced with Pub 1842. We were extremely excited to try this pub, and even made reservations months before. But, that's pretty much where the excitement wore off; This place was one of the worst dining experiences we've all had, not just in Vegas.  First off, the table taps looked pretty sweet, but right out of the gate they were out of Weihenstephaner.  For starters we went with some Homemade Frickles, Hot Salted Pretzels with 'Merican beer cheese, poached egg, and an order of Duck Spring Rolls.  Our Frickles were extremely bland and no one wanted to finish them. At least they were hot, as our order of Pretzels and Spring Rolls were cold. After we sent them back, we didn't get a poached egg in the cheese when they returned with a new one. Since they were kind of hot, well, lukewarm I'd say, we just shrugged it off. The Spring Rolls were bland as well, but that was only the beginning.  For our main entrees, not one person out of the group of six enjoyed theirs.  The Wedge Salad featured huge, undercooked, fatty bacon that ended up lining the edges of the bowl. Even a waitress was hard pressed not to notice.  The Mac & Cheese was bland and had too much black truffle. When I was younger I use to think, 'How can you screw up a Mac & Cheese?' but in my years I've grown to know that it's the simple dishes that are hard to execute and easy to muck up. Even in a group of 6, we barely ate half of it, and left the rest.  After seeing the bacon that accompanied the Wedge salad, we were quite scared at what The Smoked Bacon Burgers would look like. Both of them came out extremely rare after they were ordered as medium rare. Another send back. Fries? Just ok. Lukewarm at best.  The Heritage Turkey Burger had so much lettuce on it while The Smoked Bacon Burgers had so little, we all joked that the Turkey Burger ran off with their lettuce. Half of the Turkey Burger was left. Doggie Bag? Ya, right.  As it stands, we left the best for last: Magical Mushrooms. The faces each of us made after trying a bite of these was priceless. The Mushrooms had a really foul after taste and almost tasted of burnt meat. Obviously they were extremely overcooked, and it was hard to pinpoint the angle Pub 1842 was going for these. I would have been much happier with some awesome salted, buttery, and fresh herb mushrooms rather than whatever these 'Magical' Mushrooms were put out to be. They were so bad that we had to tell the waitress of how foul they tasted. No joke, all six of us spit them up into our napkins. A sight to behold.  Even our pickles were past their expirations and just plain uneatable.  Our waitress was super nice, but her attitude completely changed after we sent back some of the items. Since we were in a group of six and had to catch the hockey game after (FROZEN FURY!), we really tried our hardest to stomach most of the dishes since we wouldn't have time to eat anything else before the drop of the puck.  Once the time came for the check, the waitress dropped it on the table and literally ran the other direction without making eye contact or saying a word. It was quite clear that she wanted to move on past this experience with a blind eye. I have to admit, so did we.  What started out really bad, ended even worse. We all hated the food so much that you couldn't convince any of us to come back, even for a free meal.",

I had a Pilsner Urquell, and scavenged some of my mom's fries which were pretty good! The hamburgers look divine! This pub actually has tap tables which I have never seen before. They are tables with kegs attached so you can pour your beers right at your table. You can put in a set amount like $20.00, or you can just pour to your heart's desire and get the bill after. Perfect for those of us who drink beer faster than a waiter can bring it!",

We were both pleasantly surprised to see that all the reviews we read prior to coming were True. The cuisine is phenomenal!!!! Yes, it is bar food. And no, this is not a place that you'd consider if you're trying to be health conscious.  But EVERYTHING is delicious!!! Its bar food with an exquisite, well executed,  twist.   My husband ordered the double bacon burger,  medium well. I had the 1842 burger with blue cheese.  also medium well. Both were cooked to perfection. It was so juicy that it could almost melt in your mouth. We also decided to share an order of nachos.  And I have to say that those were some of the best nachos ive ever had. They were so huge that they could have been eaten as an entree. Also, well executed.   The only grievance I had with entire dining experience was with the size of the drinks. For $ 14.00 , your specialty cocktail is served in what appeared to be a 10 ounce mug, filled with 70% ice. Was it delicious? Yes. Worth $14.00? Not so much.   Overall, if you're in the mgm looking for an amazing casual meal, I would definitely keep this place mind.",

My husband and I sat at the bar just wanting appetizers we chose the Lobster Fritters and the Kale Salad.  Don't go there.

Our server (bartender) never came back he wouldn't even make eye contact with us. I believe because he knew it was bad.  Maybe the burgers are good I don't know but it is a limited menu so everything should be really good. We left with $70 less in our pocket for one appetizer one salad two drinks and tip.  We left for them a tip 95% of the salad and 65% of the Lobster Fritters (portion of four fritters we each tried one - but didn't finish those).  I would choose another place to eat.",

He was extremely knowledgeable about the beer selection when we asked him about our particular tastes he was able to point out good selections.   I had the peanut butter crunch burger and it was delicious!!  I believe everyone at the table enjoyed their food as well.  We did have an order of the Lobster dogs (I think that is what they are called) for an appetizer.  They left a little more to be desired in my opinion.  Overall the the evening was great and big props to Hunter he did a great job.",

I got the falafel sandwich with tzatziki...meh. The sandwich was slightly overdone and the tzatziki didn't have much flavor. Instead of serving a plate full of french fries, maybe offer a salad or a different option for a starch. That would make this dish stand out from others. I would have rated this 3 stars, but the kale salad bumped it up to 4 stars.",

DRINKS: 4 Stars- My guy had many choices of beer 'dark' on tap and the bartender was quick to give samples, so he could pick his fav. PRICE: 3 Stars (someday...Vegas will have bargains...Nah.. don't think so... cause we keep paying these prices )  two wines, two beers, a delicious mixed drink (Spanish Harlem) and a side of chips and salsa (non-menu) and no hesitation to provide my request...$75 I was happy, this was a good night and I think it will be a 'good find' for this local to return to.",

Started both nights with nachos. As would be expected at a Michael Mina restaurant they were a major step above standard fare. Perfect blend of sweetness and spice in the corn, chili, jalapenos and house made cheese created the best nachos we've ever had. 1842 burger is a must. Delicious blend of caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms and truffle aioli. The fish in the fish and chips melted in your mouth; incredibly fresh fish with a very light tempura batter. Pasta, kale Caesar salad and ahi also were big hits with the fellas.  Chef Mina was in the restaurant both nights. Very friendly and approachable. This has made our \"must visit on next trip\" list.",

We sat down and had a great server that was fast, friendly and had food suggestions. We got bacon burgers and fries, simple meal. We got huge bacon burgers that were cooked perfect, juicy and very tasty. The best burger I have had in Vegas so far. The fries were good too but the burger, mmmmm. We got a couple of Mules to drink, very good and refreshing. Bonus was sitting on edge of pub and people watching going by at the MGM. Watching people buy over priced soap that looks like food, really a store just for that. Watch the people getting fast food tacos and frozen margaritas by the yard, brain freeze. Well, I hope some of what we saw stays in Vegas. Just go here for a great meal and a great show.",

We had the frickles which were nicely fried and the sauce that accompied them was really good.  I ordered the Bourbon BBQ Chicken which was really tasty but also like an explosion of too much stuff in my mouth.  Personally, I think they should reconsider this sandwich.  The chicken itself was absolutely delicious but when accompanied with all that other stuff, gouda cheese, bacon, tomato, pickled red onion and bbq aioli, it was simply too much. My sandwich fell apart during the first bite.  I did also really like the spicy bun on this sandwich but wasn't crazy about the seasoned fries.",

    "text": "I like Pub 1842. There's good food, good service- can't complain!   I remember going to their grand opening 2 years ago or so, I was excited to check out Michael Mina's new pub. They brought around appetizers so we were able to try a few of their menu items. The duck spring rolls and lobster corn dogs were delicious. Not your typical pub food!  Since then, I've been back to Pub 1842 quite a few times. I'm pretty simple when it comes to pub/bar food. For a starter, I would recommend their pretzel. Comes out freshly baked with a beer cheese dipping sauce. There's a poached egg and bacon bits in the cheese... Amazing!   If you want something light, I would absolutely recommend the Avocado Kale Caesar Salad. Kale has a unique bitter taste which some people love/hate. I personally am a fan and think it's a great contrast to the Caesar dressing. You can add protein it if you like (I've added the garlic shrimp and the salmon before, I prefer the shrimp).   If you want to go for a burger, I've tried the 1842 burger and it's a solid choice if you like truffle and mushrooms. I've tried the Double Smoked Bacon burger which is meaty and flavorful, with large pieces of bacon and smoked gouda on top of the patty. They have some unique burgers too, a Peanut Butter Crunch burger and a Korean BBQ Salmon burger. I haven't tried either of those yet but I'm sure I will at some point!   Good pub-style food and the service hasn't disappointed yet. I'll be back again!",

These were excellent. We only got half an order of nachos, but it was still very filling between the five of us as an appetizer.   For my meal, I got the 1842 burger. It was cooked to perfection (at least it seemed that way at the time), and the mushrooms and caramelized onions went perfectly with the bleu cheese. I wanted to sub out the bleu cheese for American, and the waitress deterred me. I was glad that I took her advice. The fries that were served with it were crispy and flavorful. The leftovers made for a wonderful midnight snack.  Despite the meal's excellence, I was so disappointed to feel like absolute crap the next day. All five of us got sick. It was very unpleasant, especially since I was traveling home the next day with limited access to bathrooms. My flight home was torturous. Everything seemed to be cooked accurately, so I'm not sure what it was. I really would not have expected this from a Michael Mina restaurant.  Edit: I had given them two stars because the food was so good even if it made my trip home hell. That last star gets subtracted because they refused to give us a refund even though all of us got sick. Apparently, it was an \"isolated incident.\" I'm not sure how multiple people getting sick is \"isolated\" but ok...",

Right of the batch, I could tell we were a big group of people for the restaurant's normal party size since we were separated into two section at the beginning. After being seated, our organizer quickly talked to the manager to see how they could manage to have the groups together instead. Rest assured, they swiftly moved the tables around to accommodate our request, that was a BIG plus.  Food wise was scrumptious. The portion is big and plenty. We ordered the nachos, calamari, and hummus plates for starter, and my oh my, I had to stop picking at them before getting full and can't have my entree. They were all very delicious. As for my entree, I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, I know, not a popular choice for a pub, however, I was extremely satisfied with it. The prawns was impeccable from the texture to its flavor. The grits was creamy and also very well seasoned.  I got to try a few other things from my coworker's dishes. The brisker was also another hit. It was very tender and fall apart as you put it in your mouth. I also heard very good things about their Pub 1842 Burger, he said before ordering, quote, \"The burger carries the restaurant's name, it has got to be good,\" and of course, it proved to deserve the name.  Service was, without a question, amazing from beginning to end. Food came out in a timely manner with no mistake nor confusion.  Price point is not bad for the quality of food and the service they offer.   I will personally return when I'm in Vegas the next time.",

I always appreciate when a restaurant does spears over chips, but my fiance and I both noticed that the batter slightly scratched the roofs of our mouths as we ate them.  I got the 1842 burger and added blue cheese, but they put so much blue cheese on the burger, that it overpowered the rest of the flavors (weirdly enough, we took my burger home and ate it as a snack later in the day, and it was significantly much better, but that's because the blue cheese taste had died down - don't get me wrong, I love blue cheese, but when you warm blue cheese, the flavor because pretty intense so you don't need a lot to go a long way)  My fiance got the bacon burger, and he said it was \"alright\" but that there wasn't anything special about it.  My favorite thing on their menu is there zero alcohol drink that has melon in it, but I got a shot of vodka in it: so refreshing and not super boozy, which was great for lunch",

Served up on a flat tray, the chips are crispy thick and all are covered with cheese, beans, sour cream.  Highly recommend.  On the way in an exiting customer said, you gotta get the bacon cheese burger but we were eating light.  Fired pickles were good but they were spears, not sliced.

The nachos are huge and you can be completely full if you split between 3 people lol. Good selection of beers, good quality food,  The service is outstanding, the only down fall is that its closed on like Wednesday and it doesnt stay open late. I wish it was open until at least like 11 or 12 and it would be 5 star.  Honestly dont need to go into that much detail about the food, you literally cant really go wrong here with the food its just top quality and delicious. Burgers for sure, good ceasar, good nachos. good turkey burger. etc. and delicious french fries and calamari.",

My date and I went with no reservations, and we were seated immediately.   We got the 1842 nachos and Double Smoked Double Bacon burger to share. The nachos portion was huge, like, omg huge. Like, what have I done to myself, huge. The pork in it was so delish and every part of the nacho chips got covered in something, unlike some places where all the bottom nachos are left with no cheese or tomatoes or nada.  Then the burger...so juicy and the meat was so good! Definitely should share this though because it is filling, not to mention filled with plenty of goodies. They stack on the fries, of course, very generously. I will be back!",

We began with the street corn and nachos to share (pro tip - order half an order of nachos - they're huge!).  The street corn was great and a perfect appetizer.  The nachos were a little soggier than normal but would be a 5 star dish if bar eating and watching a game.  They have a nice nacho kick as well which was unexpected.  For my meal I had the delicious turkey burger with some added jalapenos to spice it up.  The turkey meat was phenomenal - chewy and fresh with some great cheesy sauce.  The burger in all was the best turkey burger I've ever had, hands down.  Mix that with a strong bun and a large portion and you have a winner.  The burger ran $19 with a $2 upcharge for a salad which is very typical for a craft burger on the strip.  The beers are overpriced by $2-3 but it is MGM so it's expected.  Michael Mina does not disappoint; Pub 1842 matches any craft burger joint on the strip for sure.",

But to the good part.......I was in the mood for steak...Not fine dining $$$$ but a decent piece of meat.  I was glad to see the 100z flatiron served with spicy fries.  I was expecting a flat but tender piece of meat.  OMG not flat - about a half inch cooked to perfection - seasoned to perfection - melt in my mouth steak!  I did not care for the dipping sauce, but the steak did not need any kind of sauce.  Fries were good nice and thin and crispy but very spicy.    Service was great, our waiter was local (we are too) and a certified beer server.  He was very knowledgeable about beers and made great suggestions with great descriptions of the taste.  He was also quite willing to provide a taste of several beers before settling on a selection.  He was enthusiastic about both the great food and the great cold beers, a very good ambassador for Michael Mina's meats!    We were very pleasantly surprised and would not hesitate to both recommend this place and to return in the future.",

It was not bad, but I did not feel like it was anything special that I must try again -- it just tasted like a regular burger with peanut butter on it.  Surprisingly, the peanut butter sauce worked well with the burger.  1 star off: It took a long time for my burger to come out.  I came here at 11:30AM when the restaurant just opened and there were only two other tables seated. 1 star off: $20 for a mediocre burger with peanut butter is overpriced.

    "text": "Customer Service Lesson 101: Incompetent Hostess Lost a Customer  I went to Michael Mina's Pub at the MGM for a late lunch (about 1:30 PM) and was offered a choice of table or bar seating. I requested a table because I needed a little space to complete some work. Yet, I was escorted to the noisier and less comfortable bar area and offered a small \"highchair\" style table that was very cramped. This wasn't what I had in mind when originally offered a table vs bar seating.  Looking around, I saw many empty regular tables and politely requested one of those instead. I was told all the tables were reserved for lunch and unavailable and that I'd have to wait at least 15 minutes to sit down. At 1:30, it was after the prime lunch crowd. It wasn't that busy and it seemed odd that all the tables would be reserved at that hour. I pointed out that there were a lot of empty tables and again requested one of them. Annoyed at the lack of effort to find a solution, it went downhill from there, and I ultimately decided to find another spot where I could have lunch.  I ended up eating in the food court adjacent to Michael Mina's where there were plenty of open tables. Upon completing my lunch at 2:15 (about 45 minutes after I first went to Michael Mina's), I was amused to see several vacant tables at Michael Mina's. including those supposed \"reserved\" tables that sat empty, just as they were when I had first arrived.  I don't dispute that some tables may have been reserved, but I doubt all of them were reserved for lunch at that hour. The restaurant appeared to be at 50% capacity. But it was more the lack of attempt to retain a customer, or say, \"Let me see what I can do.\" Instead, the hostess let a first-time customer walk out the door, possibly losing a customer for life. There is way too much competition and choice. Restaurants need to hire, train, and empower their personnel to use a little common sense. Sadly, this is increasingly rare. Hence, my 2-star review is based on a poor service experience only and not the quality or taste of the food, which I never had an opportunity to try.",

The two stars are because service was really great. The food, though, gets a one star at best! This is so not typical for a Michael Mina restaurant! I ordered the warm pretzel with cheese/ bacon as a starter for the table. Not impressive, yet rather basic. I could have done without it as I have had so much better at other restaurants. I then ordered the hummus/tahini/tomato with falafel sandwich, with Salad on the side ( extra $2 for salad instead of barbecue fries). I love falafel and know what it should taste and look like. I will describe the sandwich in one word: gross! It was way too fatty with too much tahini sauce and the falafel patty tasted like anything but falafel! I expected that it would be in a pita or wrap. It was presented like a hamburger.. Just terrible! The salad was just green leaves with an overly sweet vinaigrette on the side... Disappointing.  The coffee was decent!  My friend ordered their 'house specialty' burger, which she said was ok/ good, yet not great or amazing.  This place is likely great for grabbing a beer and watching sports on some screens. It probably has good barbecue, yet like many people, I prefer to make healthier choices that I expect should be really good as on the menu!  Therefore, will not be going back for lunch and not sure if I will ever try dinner there as lunch was pretty bad. The best parts were good coffee and very friendly service.",

Turkey burger is amazing, moist and delish with avocado spread on top. Seasoned fries equally tasty. Ahi tuna fresh and light. Salads were interesting and smartly prepared.   Servers all appeared to be having the best times of their lives. One even remembered my name. Overall great experience and very happy to have discovered the pub in a sea of other choices.",

I came in, sat by the bar, and ordered an entree, beer, and whiskey tasting flight. Unfortunately halfway through my meal, I bumped a whiskey glass with my beer stein, and shattered the glass. As I reached for my napkin to wipe up the mess, my bartender immediately sprung into action to contain the spill. Seconds later, a guy dressed in a suit (I'm guessing the MOD) walked towards me.  At this point, I'm thinking, \"Well, time to be told I'm drunk and get thrown out.\"  The suit instructs me to please put down my napkin, and let his staff handle the clean up. Then, to my utter surprise, he apologizes to me, and says he would like to place a new order for everything. Astonishingly, he cooly explains that it would be unsafe and unacceptable to let a guest continue a meal potentially contaminated with glass.  Outstanding.",

I said aloud \"oh look happy hour Thursday - Monday 2-5pm\" we decided to pull up to MGM immediately since we were starving. We put the car to valet (which cost $15). As we walk up to the pub the lady outside tells us it's not opening until 5. We arrived at 2:00. I told her there was nothing on the menu mentioning they were closed & open at 5, it wasn't on yelp either. I told her we wasted our time cuz of this & now our money on valet. She told us the concierge would refund the valet service.   They sent us all around & in the end no one refunded us, we wasted an hour of our time on an empty stomach. Please pub note this information on your Yelp at least and don't have people coming starving when they think it's open.",

I ordered a salad (most meals where carb heavy) and a baked potato. My husband had chicken wings with the baked potato. Both where very delicious. As with everything in Vegas, pretty pricey. But the service and food where excellent. Lost one star as it would be nice to see a meat dish that came with a salad option (and didn't cost an additional $3-$6 to substitute).",

    "text": "Everyone knows I stalk my favorite bartenders on IG. When I suspected that Brian Means had his hand on creating the [short] cocktail menu at Michael Mina Pub, I made sure to drag my friends to check it out.   Located at the MGM Grand next to the shops, the Pub is a great place to have dinner after doing some window shopping.This is Mina's version of a beer and burger joint so make sure to try both! It's casual and loud like any typical American bar that houses ten TVs. We caught the tail end of the world series here back in October and it was popping!  We started at the bar since we came a bit early for our reservation and instantly, I wanted to have a dessert like cocktail. The 1842 Cable Car had Captin Morgan spiced rum, orange curacao, eggwhite served on a martini glass with a burnt suar cinnamon rim. It is plenty sweet but seems fitting for a turn of the season cocktail. Delicious and foamy were two things that I was looking for and it didn't disappoint. The  $14 price tag might seem steep at first especially if you're being poured Captain Morgan, but the size of the glass actually justifies it. I'd get a smaller version in SF for sure. The beer list is long and is offered in varying sizes (even a 33oz. boot!) and he enjoyed an Innis & Gunn scottish ale. Dark brown in color with some chocolatey notes, this is a thin beer that goes down easy ;-)  We had deep fried calamari to start and it was breaded and fried to perfection. Our entrees varied from my girlfriend who got the shrimp and grits (passable) to the boys who indulged on the BBQ sampler (HUGE! great tasting meats, but just ok sides) and the special Bacon Burger for me. My burger was cooked medium as requested and was piled on with a smoked gouda & American cheese and two crispy bacon strips. The bacon jam added a hint of sweetness to it which I liked. While everything came together harmoniously and the fries were exceptionally crispy, I feel that $20 is overcharging for a pub burger. But whatcha gotta do, that's Vegas for you.   I wouldn't have had a second cocktail but since our food took more than 30 minutes to appear (I guess they were massaging the cow?!) I ordered a Negroni with my standard Plymouth Gin. Bracing and bitter is just how I like it!  Overall, a nice casual alternative to all the fancy fine dining offered at MGM. Not everyone wants to go to L'Atelier or Joel Robuchon so I'm happy that Mina has a pub for us ordinary folks.",

I can't speak to the atmosphere, as we had it from our room, but I will definitely be back. One drawback is that you can't call down and order out, you have to sit at the bar.

I mentioned prior to seating that it was my girlfriends' birthday and the hostess nodded, seated us and off we were to an amazing lunch.   *CALAMARI $16 - The fried calamari was good, it was in a huge tin perfect for sharing between 2-3 people. It was on the salty side which stops you from having too much of it but nicely season with the herbs. Smoked marinara and lemon garlic aioli for dipping. It's one of those can order or not sort of dish.   *BACON BURGER $19 - This was amazing! the beef patty cooked to a medium well doneness but still juicy, how?! Nice ratio of melted cheeses (gouda and american) that did not overwhelm, perfectly cooked crispy bacon strips. The burger came cut in half, i don't know if that's their standard or because they assume we were sharing. We did, it was a lot! Comes with fries, potato + potAto:  *BAKED SWEET POTATO $11 - This was excellent, perfectly baked large sweet potato that's sure to be too much for one person. The maple-chipotle cream cheese is genius, but can be too creamy and heavy, you better scrape some of that aside to reach the potato. Sweet on sweet can be a bit too...well, sweet, make sure you share this. Dusted with Pecan Streusel Sea Salt, makes this side dish a freaking winner. Loved it!   *CHOCOLATE STICKY TOFFEE CAKE $6 (FREE, which came as a surprise after I mentioned the bday) So delicious and smart. Listen to this, Bourbon chocolate cake (sick), spiked caramel (what?!), chocolate mousse (keep going), chocolate streusel (Lord Jesus) and caramel freaking corn (can I get a pop-cooorn)! The BOMB (bear in mind i never say a food is bomb, but in this case, it's the only word that can describe this masterpiece)   Service was excellent, loved the decor, the beer tables. It was all an unforgettable experience. This totally made our day!",

I loved the casual yet \"local\" atmosphere. They were playing the Las Vegas Knights  (hockey) game and had local brews on tap. Great draft beer selection.  I had an 1842 burger which had truffle aioli and mushrooms on it. It was perfect! Also the fries gave a BBQ seasoning on them that will make you crave more. I sat at the bar in order to have a quick service, which it was. The bar tenders were very nice and efficient.  Highly recommend!",

Everything in Vegas is so expensive and Michael Mina is no exception.  My friend and I decided to split the large featured burger, I think it was called the Champ or some such.  Of course they charge for split entrees.  I am not a huge burger eater and neither is my friend but both of us loved this one.  We both agreed that it was on our lists of top burgers ever eaten.  The fries were also great, seasoned with bbq seasoning and they gave us a huge portion.  The drinks were also good - both cocktails and beer.  I am always happy when a bar gives you plenty of choices for beer and has local options to pick from.  The service was also very good.",

The only redeeming bartender was this older bartender that actually noticed my water was empty and refilled it without having to be asked.  Other than that, I did not enjoy the bar. If the staff was friendlier and more engaging we definitely would have stayed for a second round. Don't sit at the bar. Sit at the tables.

He also tried the around the world beer sampler, which was a great deal and had some good variety.  Being gluten free, I was surprised at the number of choices I had! I decided on a wedge salad and a baked potato. The salad - amazing! The bacon was like ham - thick and juicy (but tasted like bacon!). And then the potato - best potato of my life. The skin was crisp and salty. Honestly, the skin was better than the inside, which never happens. Between those two things, I had MORE than enough food, and was totally stuffed. I shared both the salad and potato with my husband, and still had leftovers. We'll be back for sure on our next trip.",

It's not cheap, but you get a ton of food and this fed 4 people.   Beer selection on tap was pretty good, but I do sort of question maintenance of the line. I ordered a Belgian brew with complex name, it was supposed to be witbier, but can honestly say it tasted like bud light, and looked like it. Argh.

I ordered the Shrimp & Grits and chose The Double Smoked Bacon Burger.  Shrimp & Grits - never had Grits before so was curious and weary at the same time. So glad I ordered this because it was amazing. Grits were creamy and cheesy, andouille sausage was very flavorful. Only con was one of my shrimp was beyond charred on one side and actually burnt. I like charred but not burnt, I didn't notice it until after I bit into it but other than that it was very yummy.",

We shared two orders of chicken wings which are really chicken drumsticks.  They were really good and come with a blue cheese dressing.  I had a chop salad, which is really a half a head of iceberg lettuce with quarter inch thick pieces of bacon.  They chilled the head of lettuce so it is very crunchy and fresh and cold.  At $14 I was a little skeptical, but after eating it it was very tasty with quality bacon.",

    "text": "The \"A Bit of Everything BBQ Plate\" was really satisfying. The weakest link on the plate being the Kale slaw which didn't really taste like anything. The slaw dressing was simply milky and lacked acid - like a weak Ranch dressing. Would've been way better with a vinegar-based formula.   I was super impressed by the St. Louis-style BBQ ribs on the Bit of Everything plate. Lean like baby backs, and robust-tasting like Texas beef ribs, I really enjoyed them. I agree with Cathy C - way better than Rollin' Smoke, and even better than the former Las Vegas Grille as well - that's saying a lot, I think! Seriously, if you were to tell me that these were just a large, delicious version of a baby back rib, I would believe it.  The brisket was great as well. Pretty smoke ring and great flavor. The fat was totally edible and had a True melt-in-your-mouth quality. Pulled pork was delicious, and the baked beans were served piping hot (which I appreciate) and tasted homemade.  I had a dozen oysters on the side - East Coast (Bluepoint, I believe), jumbo-sized and moderately priced at $3/pop. Good luck finding them for less coin on the Strip (at least these ones are huge.)  Overall I would put this place a cut above the Todd English and Gordon Ramsay Pubs, and on the same food par as Rx Boiler Room, but I believe Michael Mina 1842 wins on price point. One of the big drags about Gordon Ramsay and Michael Mina is the walking distance from the Self Park deck (about 12-14 mins). Even from the Valet it takes about 10 mins to walk to both places. But I guess a nice walk is good thing after a meal like this?",

The setup is nice with a large bar area and many tvs.  The beer list is long and solid, for Vegas, but lacks some of the better IPAs...but again, I am currently spoiled when it comes to beer.  They also have very good cocktails.  The happy hour specials are excellent...I've tried the tater tots and the brisket sliders and both were very tasty.  The burgers are outstanding although I wasn't a huge fan of the \"must try\" PB Crunch burger.  It was a -happy I tried it but would never get it again- type deals. My friend got nachos which were very unique and tasty.  SO, as far as creative pub food goes in Vegas, this is a great option.",

We figured walking through the MGM on the way to the pool we'd find SOMETHING, but to no luck. Pub 1842 was our only option, and even they didn't open until 11:30.  We were the second customers to get in, and we sat at the bar for faster service. Although our bartender didn't know a lot about the breakfast menu, we picked something quickly. We ordered the Andouille sausage sandwich, which he told us came with fries.  We were very pleasantly surprised. The sandwich was so good! The bread used was like a thin version of Texas toast, without all the carbs. It was delicious, and almost melted in your mouth. The fries served with the sandwich were also amazing! They were heavily seasoned, with something like a general seasoning salt, but they were delish!   I would definitely come back for that sandwich. We shared it between the two of us and we couldn't even make a dent in the fries.",

Of all the restaurants at the MGM i'd say this is the most casual/ cool/ pub food place.  I have eaten here three times.  I've had the Frickles, the Sliders and the Peanut Butter Burger. All tasty. I enjoy them all. Prices are a bit high, but it's the strip. GOOD BEERS ON TAP. Took the Waitresses over 5 minutes to even notice my friend and i sitting at the bar. We felt ignored. But they were busy. Yes, i would recommend this place if you are at the MGM. Most of their restaurants are VERY expensive. except for maybe the Rainforrest Cafe and the Sports bar joint called TAP. I like this place. A-OK.",

The NFL playoffs were on, so they told a lot of people that they couldn't seat them, except, when they seated our party of 8, there were empty tables everywhere. Even the bar had seating. Wasn't quite sure what they were doing, but plates are massive here. BLT's have two layers for the sandwich with loads of meat and cheese. Fries are abundant and cheap, and if you get their signature nacho plate, you get a ridiculous heaping stack of chips, beans, cheese, and peppers. It's enough to make you think you've fallen into nacho heaven, and it's not overly pricey for a Michael Mina place...inside the MGM. Food comes out pretty quickly, and waitstaff is pretty nice once you get in. Great place to watch a game, drink a brew, and eat some pub grub.",

Tv's everywhere of course and entertaining sayings on the walls.  Had the fried pickles appetizer which is an entire spear deep fried. Not crazy about it but apparently it's what all the cool restaurants are doing these days.  I had the shrimp and grits which wasn't terrible but not amazing either. I felt like I was eating out of a sombrero because the plate had a ridiculous rim, and the grits were more like mashed potatoes. The shrimp had good flavor and it also had a pretty tasty piece of sausage in there too.   Also tried the brisket: I'll forgive them because it's not Texas, but it didn't blow my mind.  The 1842 burger on the other hand blew my mind, and upon tasting it after finishing my meal and deciding I was full, proceeded to eat half of my friends burger. Mushrooms were fantastic and some crack laced aoli I think.  The Mac and cheese is also fantastic. Great flavor with actual melted cheese instead of the packet crap and its dusted with a spice that I think is also laced with crack.  Finally, dessert... The butterscotch custard is heaven in a little bowl with a solid layer of caramel and a little bit of whip cream and something crunchy. We also had some chocolate cake which has a river of caramel mousse next to it with caramel corn for crunch.   Take home story, go for the burger, get dessert, return to your room and fall into a coma.",

    "text": "Years ago, Seablue at MGM was one of our favorite restaurants. It had great seafood Mediterranean influence and everything was light and healthy. It has since switched gears, the space closed for a brief time and re-opened, last summer, as yet another Gastropub. Burger and pizza joints have monopolized the dining scene on the strip much to my chagrin. Michael Mina joined the trend with Pub 1842.   The space has a great pub feel. Servers were quick and friendly. The draft beer selection was a bit lacking, but they did offer Weihenstephaner ($12) which is a solid choice. Beers were on special during our visit, buy one, get one.   I have a weakness for all things duck. So, the spring rolls ($16) were an easy choice when it came to choosing an appetizer. They offered a Bourbon Burger ($19) on special. Which Frank was unable to resist, he's been hooked on Maker's Mark since our tour in KY earlier this year. I chose the 1842 Burger.   The spring rolls failed to impress, they fell into the category of your typical pub grub offering. The 1842 is served in a basket (awkward for eating) and comes with caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms and a truffle aioli. I was offered cheese, but Swiss was not an option and it was what sounded most appealing. I had requested the burger to be cooked medium, but it was a poor choice. It was well done. It was dry. The bun was dry. And I found the truffle aioli to be far more tangy than expected and the truffle flavor was very faint. I struggled to eat half of it before throwing in the towel. The Bourbon Burger was a better choice, but still left Frank pretty underwhelmed. Both burgers came with a generous portion of seasoned fries.   The prices are inflated and the menu items do not warrant the price. I've always been a big fan of Michael Mina restaurants, but this one missed the mark. It's really quite sad that Seablue shuttered for this.",

It was definitely a champ with its flavorful patty, soft and fresh buns, bacon, smoked gouda and American cheese, and their \"secret sauce\"! It came with a side of BBQ fries. The shoestring fries were dusted with BBQ seasoning reminiscent of Lays' BBQ chips. It was very addicting.

I really wanted to taste it too! Likewise with the lobster mac and cheese, the texture of the lobster was evident, but there was little flavor.  We received satisfactory service, but the bar is very busy during happy hour and we were lucky to get a seat.

She picked out pink areas of her burger. I ate my half. This was the last meal we had before flying out Friday morning. 5am I woke up sick throwing up. By the time I landed at home I had to rush straight to restroom again and again even before my Lyft arrived. Later I got a ride to ER and yep 9 hours later food poisoning. Never have I ever. The patty on the burger was super thick so the cook needs to make sure they are cooked well done before serving. Only yesterday was I able to drink water and eat soup. Horrible horrible experience",

Took more than 25 minutes for the first drinks to come, and they sat on the counter several minutes before they came. We told them we had an appointment and were assured there would be no problem. Again, times ticking...oh, your food is being plated. Again nothing.  Us girls had to leave or risk our hair appointment. Really? 90 minutes? So my nephew paid for our meals and had them boxed. Again, really???? Nachos and salads....boxed? They should have never charged him for that food at the very least. Very poor customer service.",

    "text": "5 Stars for finger licking good food with flavor packed punches and cool guys who deliver the best service!   JD & Weston, thank you for all of your food recommendations, great conversations, and absolutely superb service. We could tell you both just love being around people and that factors in with how well you do your job! If we are ever in town, we'll be sure to stop by for a drink at the bar just to say hi! You both are truly cool guys!   I highly recommend coming during Happy Hour where you can try almost everything for a bargain! If you're iffy about something, just order it because you'll regret not doing so. Honestly, I think I went with one of everything!   My faves:  Mini Pulled Pork Tacos: Although I'm not a huge fan of items that have slaw, the pulled pork was so wonderfully seasoned and juicy, I didn't really mind. Presentation was beautiful and I couldn't help but take out my phone and take a few pictures (which JD & Weston made fun of! haha but it was worth the share).  Korean Pork Ribs: I loved these! The meat falls right off the bone on these. After you're done with them you'll be wishing you had ordered a second round! They are on the sweet side but the mint flavors surprisingly mesh wonderfully.   Overall we had strong drinks and a great meal. Can't wait to come back and visit before a wet republic pool party.",

I was able to make reservations online through my rewards account and was seated pretty promptly. $5 Bud Lights in a super frosty mug for college football, count me in. The brisket hash was really good, wish it had a bit more of a spicy kick (I added tabasco on top) but enjoyed it nonetheless. The waitress also thankfully chopped up our bill four ways so we didn't have to do beer math at the end. Everyone at my table enjoyed their food. We also had the pretzels w/beer cheese, which also rocked. Just didn't like the rather long wait time from sitting down, ordering, and getting our orders--I get it was college football Saturday, but it didn't look that busy inside while we were there. Oh well, recommended nonetheless for a decent meal that won't break the bank.",

We sat down in the bar area and asked the waiter. He said there was one but you have to sit at the bar top. We switched and then the male bartender said they didn't have happy hours for Fourth of July. It was very irritating and started off the meal on the wrong foot.

We easily spend over $100 between the two of us when she's working and keeps us coming back for more. It's nice to have a fav spot to grub and drink where you know the staff makes you feel welcomed.  2. The Food. Okay, first off, this is frickin' VEGAS. DUH, everything on the strip is going to be hella expensive. But you know what? For the price point, this place serves, HANDS DOWN, the best food. I put this place down as \"good for 'Late Night' and 'Desserts'\" because gastropub food only goes so far and if you're expecting \"sit-down dinner,\" this place probably wouldn't cut it. But, if you're out with friends and wanna get some grub before you hit the tables/slots and have a couple beers, this is the place to do it. If you have a party of 4 or more, I recommend sharing the HUGE nacho platter (comes on a frickin' baking sheet) or if you have a small party, get the fried pickles (\"frickles!\") and an entree to share. The baked ziti is our favorite; between hubby and I, we've ordered it twice within the span of 72hours and it's been awesome every time.  3. The Ambiance It's so relaxing and nice to just be able to come in, sit down, have a beer, get some grub, and zone out watching some sports news. And this pub just gets it right on the money. I have been to many a gastropubs on the strip and I don't quite know what it is that other places don't have. I assume it has something to do with the fact that they have the bar in the center and it really focuses on its forte--being the best beer pub on the street. They also have a dart board and beer pong table in the corner if you're so inclined; for no additional charge (I assume; we weren't charged to play). I also love that EVERYTHING in print (menus, posters, coasters, etc.) at this place is so frickin' beautifully designed. I've gone to many a places where I'm sure they've got some great food, but their menu was soooooo poorly designed it just ruined the whole eating experience for me.   4. The Service. What can I say, this really just reiterates number 1, but I want to make sure the whole restaurant also gets recognition. The food comes piping hot right out of the open kitchen and you can really see the kitchen working it, every moment that it's open. You can really tell the people behind the bar and the kitchen really works as a team.   ...Gosh, writing this makes me hungry. Maybe we should get some lunch there. Haven't tried them for lunch yet. Yeah, frickles sound good right about now. Bye guys!",

Wait times during sporting events will probably be longer. I noticed that some tables have a beer draft machine. The server explained that the table pays for a certain amount and can fill their own and pay as you go. What a great idea! The only downside, there are only 2 types of beer at each of these tables and they all serve different kinds of beer.   I tried the 1842 burger, which was pretty tasty. It was moist and flavorful. However, the asian salad was a disappointment. It was nothing spectacular and had some weird chipotle flavor.   I was able to redeem my Yelp check-in offer. Buy 1 get 1 free beer. Great deal!",

The atmosphere is very lively - a place you would go with a big group of friends.  I ordered 2 drinks from the bar - first was the Soda Popinski. It is their take on the Moscow Mule. This drink was amazing. I would actually go back just for this drink. It was light, refreshing and delicious. I think the second drink was called the Aviation (or something similar) and it was a gin cocktail with Creme de Violette and a maraschino cherry. This drink was also very good. Both drinks looked great and well presented.  The food overall was just above average. The presentation was fabulous on all food items but the flavor was not up to Michael Mina's highest standards. The nachos were eh... How can you mess up nachos? The deviled eggs were great though there were only three pieces and I ate 2 so the rest of the table was shit out of luck. The poke was pretty good. I felt like it could use more flavor and there were only 5 shrimp chips. It should definitely come with more! The crab cake was good. There was a lot of crab in there which is good but it wasn't anything spectacular!  For the entree I had the salmon done medium well. Again, this was just okay.  Lacking flavor a little. The wasabi mashed potatoes were good.  This is a beautiful space with great servers and great drinks. It was their opening night so that may have been why the food was a little off. I will definitely come back and give them another chance. I do want to try the lobster corn dog!!!",

It's average in price, if not cheaper, than most places directly on the boulevard.   Oh... And make sure to try a beer you've never had. If you order a bud light, I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate the awesome food they serve.   Little secret, they have a ton of bourbons and whisk(e)y's. So if that tickles your fancy, this pub is desirable for you.",

We went here looking for an okay spot for dinner, and it was a really disappointing experience.  At first, the service seemed good.  Our hostess was very welcoming as she led us to our booth, and I'll tell you -- in public, me and the guys are quite cool to be around.  But we never saw our server again.  I ordered a \"Homemade Fireball\" because it's a favorite of us back home, but it was horrible.  We had no chase either.  Disgusting.  I ordered a rack of ribs, which is usually conservative choice because you can't really grill those wrong, so it was good.  My friend had some nachos to start and those were great, but he didn't enjoy his entree--I think it was tuna.  My other friend didn't enjoy his prime rib either.  We don't usually box stuff, but that's what we ended up doing.  I see myself coming back for beer... but it's Vegas, I'm rarely ever here to have a beer.  But since I'm getting older, I'll probably hit this spot up on a casual Vegas night.",

I've always had good pub experiences, so we settled here! We sat at the bar and I had the Bourbon BBQ Chicken Sandwhich which was delicious! We were clearly staying past closing time, but nobody ever rushed us which was surprising. We left shortly after realizing they were cleaning up. However, we decided to come back the next day for the Eagles/Falcons game. This time around, I had the pulled pork sandwhich and it did not disappoint.

He was very friendly and took time to talk about why he liked the restaurant. After being seated we were happy to see local Nevada craft beers as the draft selection. We shared a 1842 burger and salad with a love lady IPA. It was perfect. The second time we went was a late night in town and we decided to Uber over to the MGM which we would never do but we really wanted local beer and good food so we knew this was our spot. We had a PB Crunch with a wedge. This again was amazing and we had a great time. The only critique we have is the staff can be overwhelmed causing them to be unfriendly. Again I can't help but think it's the constant tourist driving them crazy but as a local I would expect a little better.",

The food is definitely WAAAAY better than any bar food, but at over $50 for a burger, side and a cocktail, it's still a little too pricey for ANY bar.  But, if you want one the best burgers around, you'll find it here......for a price.",

We were staying at the MGM Signature and needed a place with alcohol, food and televisions that were playing the game. Luckily, we found this spot which is conveniently located between MGM and The Signature.  Upon entering, we were promptly seated and served. Though it is a little on the pricey side, the portions were massive! We got the spicy chicken sandwich, calamari and pulled pork sandwich. Our food was so satisfying and delicious. Though our dining experience was great, our spirits were crushed after Cleveland beat the Warriors for the championship. Overall, we'll definitely be back to watch Curry, Klay and KD take the championship back.",

I got the 1842 with the 1842 side salad.. the burger had tons of umami flavor and was really juicy and the salad was perfectly dressed with yummy shaved veggies. My husband got the bacon burger and a baked potato. He could barely take two bites of his burger because he ate the entire giant potato. The BEST part of lunch was our waitress... she was so friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there. I wish I remembered her name, but she was gorgeous and said she was from Thailand. I definitely recommend grabbing a bite here!!",

The food is delicious (have the burger or pulled pork sandwich) and is prepared perfect.  Out of 13 entrees, every person in our party loved their meals.   3.  The service is dependent on who you get. Over the course of a 7 day convention, we ate there 3 times. All the male servers were completely nice and friendly. All the female servers couldn't be bothered and kinda had chips on their shoulders.  We ignored it, but it was really noticeable all 3 times.    I would definitely go back the next time we are at the MGM. It's great for happy hour and/or any sporting event!",

We opted for their prix fix lunch to include cocktails...bargain for what we got!   My meal included a choice of any of their signature burgers, and yes, I selected the 1842, carmelized onions, mushrooms, truffle aioli and a choice of sides, and I selected the seasoned BBQ french fries.   Both items were HUGE.   My lunch also included a 'boozy shake', and I chose a Vanilla Shake with Vanilla Vodka.  That was amazing.     Their food was large in portion and tasty too.

My friend and I shared the appetizer of BBQ chicken drumsticks in a Carolina sauce. The drumsticks were big, 6 of them, for $14. I loved the sauce, tangy and sweet with just a hint of heat in them. Almost overpowering but good. Drink prices were a bit high, as is typical with a Strip location.   Thanks to our bartender who was really helpful and friendly.

Last night stopped by for a drink before dinner and met a great bartender can't remember his name but he was great. We decided we would try to them for lunch. Came in and asked for a table we were sat in an empty section and told because we wanted lunch we needed to wait  15 min for that to start. No problem but from there seems like we were forgotten about many times after placing our order. The food was good got the ribs but the kale slaw and beans weren't my fave. I just feel if I am paying a lot of money for food the service needs to be up to par and it wasn't.  Too bad the good bartender from the night before wasn't there.",

Pub 1842 provides an average experience. Everything is edible but not particularly memorable or delicious.   The service was fine. I will have to say that of all the restaurants we visited in Vegas, which includes Gordon Ramsay Pub, Mesa Grill, Spago, DOCG and others, the server at Michael Mina Pub was the only one to refold my napkin when I left the table. The servers have been trained here.  If you find yourself at MGM with no place to eat, Michael Mina Pub would probably be fine. You'll leave feeling that you overpaid, but that happens almost everywhere in Vegas.",

Avocado Kale Caesar salad (parmesan, artichoke chips and garlic streusel)... Kinda deconstructed and it was oh so delicious. Normally, I don't like Caesar salad.   The 1842 burger with caramelized onions, mushrooms and a truffle aioli. Simple but cooked to medium rare perfection. And the fries and onion rings were warm and crispy. No sogginess here.   The Green Chile - Heritage Pork soup was tasty. It had some crispy tortilla strips, cream and a tortilla on the side for dipping. Nice flavor combinations.   We finished our meal with warm cookies (chocolate chip and double chocolate chip!) and a vanilla shake. Can never go wrong with warm cookies and a shake. Yum!  Our wait person, Rick, was superb. He was super friendly and went over the menu with us as this was our first time in. He was on top of everything. We never had to wait or want for anything too long.",

    "text": "FANTASTIC! That's really all I want to say...but I'll elaborate.  Pub 1842 is a no frills restaurant serving pub food, but backed by Michael Mina, so of course it will be delicious!  After a week of eating out for every meal, I just wanted something simple. I was debating between the Organic Half Chicken and Scottish Salmon...both I suppose are equally healthy, right? But why go to a restaurant just to have \"banquet chicken\"? Well, that's when I looked at what sides they come with and made my final decision.  The Organic Half Chicken came on top of a bed of truffled Mac and Cheese.  How do you say no to that?! So there's a running joke in the hospitality industry (at least the people that I worked with) that if you are not adventurous, you're always safe with getting the chicken.  Every menu will have that \"safe\" chicken option.  I laughed at myself a bit when I did finally order the chicken. But OMFG! It was DELICIOUS!  Everything about it was amazing! It was well seasoned and juicy! I finished every last morsel of my meal, which I didn't do any other meal during the week! I was amazed with every single bite. I didn't want my meal to end! (And the night before, I had a bone-in ribeye, my fave, but I didn't even finish that!!).  I will have to also mention that it was great to find a few San Franciscan items on the menu, including the \"San Franciscan\" which was Anchor Steam and Fernet Branca. My only response to that is *heart*.",

I liked the mustard sauce, but really, considering how they were, and how much they were, they're probably the least value for your money. I would pass on these again.   But the BURGERS were VERY TASTY. Everyone liked theirs, and I enjoyed a bite of my friend's salmon burger, too!   I opted for the Peanut Butter Crunch burger, which is a burger with bacon jam and chips (read: Ruffles - the only thing on the burger not made in-house, or fresh). Our server told me it was going to be one of the heavier burgers on the menu, but I still managed to finish it rather quickly and cleanly, surprisingly so. It made me want to put chunky peanut butter on all the things...   A friend ordered a shake, but it took forever to come out because they said the shake machine was broken and the dude had to do it by hand. It precluded us from getting any desserts, since most included some sort of shake!   If I have a burger craving in Vegas, I will definitely come here. We even go to sit at a booth with good people-watching potential. And Vegas is a good place to people watch!

Luckily, a bunch of people were just looking at the menu and asking the hostess questions, so we were actually seated right away in a booth. The first thing I noticed was that water was served in mason jars, which was cool because you don't see that very often. Our server was William, who was very friendly, knowledgeable with the menu and very attentive. The one item on the menu that caught my eye was the Peanut Butter Crunch Burger. Yes, you heard that right. The Peanut Butter Crunch Burger. As crazy and odd as it sounds, it seemed very interesting and I just had to try it.   Just an FYI, all of their burgers are 1/2 pound. So come hungry, or agree to share! My husband was going to order The Champ, but after finding out that the burgers were were huge, we decided to share. They were able to cut the burger in half and add an equal amount of fries in each basket for $1.50 more. We also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. The burger was HEAVEN in my mouth!! I don't even know who Michael Mina is, but he is a fricken GENIUS!! The meat was cooked perfectly, it was hot and juicy. The peanut butter and bacon jam made the burger awesome! It was sweet and salty, which I normally would not want to taste in a burger. But, it was THE BEST BURGER EVER!! Honestly, I'm not really a burger person. There are good burgers, there are bad burgers, and at the end of the day, it's just a damn burger. But, this is the one that I will remember forever! My favorite for sure!! Soooo delicious, my husband loved it as well. Ok, I won't say anymore. Just go and try it! The Mac and cheese was pretty good too, not too salty or rich, and they cut the broccoli into small pieces.   I can't wait to come back here! I also don't know if I can order something different next time. Again Michael Mina, you are a genius and thank you so much for your heavenly burger!!! And...if you ever feel like opening another location, can you do one away from the strip? Say Westside or Summerlin area? That would be great. :P",

Sat at the bar at 5:30 and it took almost 10 minutes to place a drink order. Server was right in front of me and never made eye contact.  Finally another bartender checked in and took my order.   Had a burger and a few beers.   Had the namesake 1824 and I've had better for comparable prices.  But the bar service was just lacking. Place wasn't that busy and they all seemed preoccupied or just not focused in their customers.   Wouldn't recommend it.",

    "text": "Two visits.  Both underwhelming for food.  Service however was great on both occasions.    Elvis would be proud of the peanut butter burger which I almost got.  Should have, since it sounded pretty unique since other items I did get were not where I was hoping they would be.  BBQ sampler was tried on round one.  Now granted, BBQ is a very special thing and if you love it you can be fussy.  So when a \"certified celebrity chef\" (whatever the \"f\" that means) claims great Q,  it better be up in the ranking.  So , served on the now to common crappy tin tray, we had a decent brisket.  Marbled with enough fat to make it very tender.  Not much of a smoke flavor and the \"rub\" was not as flavorful as it should have been. Still solid.  The pulled pork was to salty but tender and no real crust which it should have.  The ribs pulled cleanly off the bone and had a nice thick glaze on top.  They were pretty solid but all in all I have had much better Q.  Only one sauce on the smokey side didn't help.  Beans were very very salty but had a lot of meat in them.  Kale slaw I liked.  Jalepeno cornbread was stale and honey butter was warm and rancid.  Had a nasty taste.  $ 32 bucks for this \"sampler\" tray was to high.  Round two brought a friend.  Got the fried cauliflower with a hot and sour sauce.  Liked this a lot.  Lightly breaded and tender.  Sauce was the right amount of hot and sweet.  Tasty. Went for the veggie burger which was made with falafel. Haven't seen that before! Points for being different but if you don't nail a falafel you are in trouble.   Friend liked the idea but said it was to gooey with all the stuff they put on it. He ate half of it.   I had a sauteed mushroom onion burger.  Slightly overcooked so it was not juicy.  If cooked a nice medium it would have been good.   But the mushrooms and onions were so frickin salty I was drinking whatever I could get my hands on all night.  A good chef should not be salting anything like this. I ate most of it before I realized how bad it was.  ( I was really hungry!).  I regretted it all night.  Some nice beer selections at modest ( by vegas standards) pricing.    So maybe I ordered the wrong things here. Other dishes sound good.  Prices are less than most of the other high end places in vegas but this is a kind of simple plain \"pub\" concept so for that you are still paying 17 bucks for a burger.  I'd rather go to one of the high end places, pay more and get better food.   A little less conversation... a little more action baby...",

They have a kids menu full of amazing foods, such as sliders, chicken fingers, etc...There signature item is the Bacon Burger. It's delicious meat and crispy bacon brings the whole burger together. It comes with perfectly seasoned, soft, crispy fries which makes it even better. Try to get there between 6-8pm for a better environment M'kay?

She knows her beers, understands how to make people feel welcome, and knows how to make some delicious drinks. She'll even make up something new and delicious for you!  I always measure the quality of a bar by the people working there, and Liz has definitely made 1842 one of my favorite pubs not just in Vegas, but anywhere! Can't recommend this place highly enough! Get the baked ziti pie! It's delicious!  Remember, when you come here, sit at the bat and look for the tall blonde bartender named Liz. She'll give you a great experience!! We love her and basically come back just for her!  Good job Pub 1842 on having such awesome staff!!",

For food we got some appetizers, the lobster corn dogs, duck spring rolls, and my favorite the 1842 nachos.  The serving sizes were more than enough to feed the 4 of us and the prices are very reasonable for a Las Vegas restaurant.  We tried out a couple of cocktails too while we were at the Pub.  The Moscow Mule was done perfectly.  They also make their own version of \"Fireball Whiskey\" in house.  It had more of the whiskey taste than the sugary Fireball that you buy in the stores.   I don't want to leave out the wonderful service that we received.  Our waitress Lindsey was very attentive and a pleasure to have as a server. She made some great recommendations and brought our food and beverages out quickly.  Our party loved the experience so much that we returned the following day after our 2nd day at the pool.",

The Arugula looked more like a garnish however, putting together the great taste of the steak, swipe in the pesto sauce from the plate and the mystery horseradish type sauce in the ramekin, and the cool taste of the arugula and you I have just eaten what was probably the best bite of steak in my life.

    "text": "I was in Vegas with some friends who had never been to the U.S. before, and much of our trip was about exposing them to some uniquely American dishes and beers. Among all the hustle and bustle of Vegas, MMP was a lucky find where my friends and I were able to relax in sporty atmosphere and try some fun American foods.    For those of you who have read my other reviews, you will know I am a friend pickle snob, so when I saw them on the menu and wanted to provide my friends with a fun, American-food experience, the friend pickles were an easy decision. Now, I am not a fan of friend pickle spears--indeed dill chips are much superior--but MMP managed a version that was acceptable. Many restaurants fail to properly bread the spear so the breading separates from the spear rendering a warm pickle without the flavor and texture needed to make a good friend pickle. MMP avoided disaster.    On another briney note, the bar also offers pickle back shots (which it calls \"hair of the dog), and provided another unique experience for my American culture sponges. I pressured one of my friends into taking a shot with me after which he noted: \"I always knew you Americans drank weird sh*t.\" Nevertheless, he said that he enjoyed it and I assume chalked the experience up to another great American first.      Aside from the food, the beer selection is also notable and should not be overlooked. If you really want a gimmick, MMP has tables that have their own taps so that you can just keep the Vegas fun coming.     Overall, I would say this is a great place for happy hour.",

I would def come back for the amazing food but maybe try getting a table with an actual waiter!",

But once the food came out, we were all happy with our selections!  And their secret sauce for the burger I probably could've drank it w a straw #delish. Not sure if I'll return but would recommend!",

We sat ln the upper level which gave us a nice view out into the mall area of the MGM.   The pub has a very solid beer selection and nicely just about everything on the menu is available!  What a concept! They have these high tops that have pay-as-you taps right at the table. How cool is that?!  Well very cool if they worked. They didn't and the bartender said they keep fixing them and then they stop working again. Bummer because its a great concept!    So I had one of their signature burgers - get this - peanut butter, pimento cheese, bacon jam and potato chips!  Right! All the food groups.  It was cooked perfectly and the combo of flavors was off the hook too. Awesome creation!  One of our group had the nachos and the presentation was unique. The whole deal came in a flat pan with the chips on the bottom of a layered kinda thing. Pretty cool really because you're guaranteed to get the full nacho spread with every bite. Nice presentation too.   Would have loved to stay longer and grab more beers from the menu, but we came in late (on a school nite) and they were closing up. Nice that they took care of us because we were hungry and thirsty and the laydown here was great. I'll be back for that burger again and maybe those high top taps will be working!",

While on vacations our thing is to try out the local beers on tap, and that's just what we did.  Don't remember the name of the beer I ordered, it was an IPA, tasted great in a cold frosty mug.

The Pilsner Urquell is listed in red on the menu. I had to ask and the server told me it was because the beer was from 1842 which is same as the restaurant. I just went with it. Beer was served at perfect temp in chilled stein.   I wanted to order the Mac Attack burger, featured as their BOTM. I just missed it and they were all out. I decided to go with the salmon burger. I know it sounded strange to me too but it was freakin amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was paired with some spicy kimchee and a few other ingredients to give it a wonderful flavor. I ate half as a burger and the other half I took out the salmon and left the bread. Burgers come with fries or you can substitute salad or other side for additional charge. I went with corn off the cob. Order the corn. Mixed with some mayo and cheese. Good stuff. My bro had the Peanut butter flavored burger. He enjoyed it as well.   The burgers run from $18-$24. Not cheap but well worth it. I thought it was a little pricey for 2 burgers and 4 beers. Came out to just under $100 before tip. Luckily, my bro treated for my b-day and he cleaned up at the sportsbook.   Service was great. The server helping us gave lots of recommendations and did not rush us at all. I thought it was cool that they allowed us, as well as the other patrons to enjoy our dining experience. I would go back and give it another try. If you have at least 6 people you could get a self serve beer table. I told them I could drink for 6 but they weren't buying it.   Happy eating/drinking!",

I was only a little disappointed that it was so casual and I looked like a weirdo wearing a skirt in a sea of jerseys and flip flops.

    "text": "The Peanut Butter Crunch Burger sounds whack-a-doodle but Yelpers rave so I had to try. I was picturing something along the lines of a Thai peanut sauce-esque burger but nope, it's straight up crunchy peanut butter sauce, served with slightly sweet bacon jam & potato chips for that extra crunch.   For a burger cooked medium rare it was rather dry and not at all juicy so I was kind of disappointed. It also came with a boatload of fries that was spiced with barbecue flavoring. That was also unexpected. It was just okay for me. Nothing \"wow\" about it. I guess it did save me a trip to Potato Corner which was on my to-do list of places to check out but ran out of time. $17 for a burger with fries is rather steep but the portions are huge.  Also had the Jungle Juice cocktail since it was only $7 at Happy Hour. I was trying to decide between that or the Soda Popinski. Since Jungle Juice was one of the Happy Hour selections that decision was easily made for me. After a long day traversing the Strip it hit the spot.   Service was friendly and excellent but the food has to sing and unfortunately it didn't. Overall this place is just A-Okay for me.  Happy Hour is Monday-Thursday from 5 to 7pm according to their website but I've seen their HH's vary so don't quote me on that. Select items are discounted so be sure to inquire. Cool place to catch a game on tv as there are several televisions strategically placed throughout the pub so it can get rather loud at times.  Located inside the confines of the MGM Grand which is a challenging casino to navigate. This is one casino where bigger is not necessarily better. You will feel like you walked a mile inside this monolith just getting in and out of this place.  TIP: Lunch is served only on the weekends, Friday-Sunday from 11:30 am. Dinner only the rest of the week.",

    "text": "Michael Mina's take on upscale bar food at the MGM. Their HH pricing allows you to get a good sample of the menu's food and drinks for a discounted price, available 4-7PM daily including holidays! Also, you're able to order from the HH menu TO-GO, which is unheard of elsewhere- and appreciated.   LOBSTER GRILLED CHEESE $9; smallish sandwich served with a veritable mountain of seasoned fries. Combining cheese and seafood is always a little dicey in my book but this dish does it well. Sadly, the fries, though plentiful and visibly seasoned, lacked flavor and crisp. They also do not reheat well, consider yourself warned.  KOREAN PORK RIBS: $11, four ribs with gochujang glaze served with peanuts and mint. Or they're supposed to. Mine came sad and lonely on a plate with zero presentation. Admittedly I ordered them right before HH ended but presentation should still be consistent and the additional components likely would have made the dish much better. As it was, I wouldn't rush to order them again but did find them to be a bit meatier than expected. Flavor was one-note, sauce seemed to be sriracha-based, wouldn't order again.  CINNAMON HARLOT: $7 George Dickel rye whiskey simple syrup, cinnamon. A simple sipping drink, very strong, ordered on the rocks and got a cool boulder of ice in my glass. Not wanting to be plastered after one drink, I asked for it to be diluted with Sprite, which is apparently fairly common. Decent flavor but not something I'd get again.  SANGRIA: $8 red red wine, velvet falernum spiced rum, blackberry liqueur, lemon. It's rare for me to find a sangria I don't like, so I really enjoyed this drink much more than the Harlot. Fruity and strong with bold flavors, decent drink size too.  Service bumped up the score higher than the product alone- bartender was attentive and friendly, accommodated my HH order for takeout and fixed my drink to my liking. I'd come back for other apps or a burger in the future.",

The restaurant was pretty quiet which made us weary.... but we sat down anyways because we were just so damn hungry!!   Michael the bartender greeted us and started up a conversation - great guy, really cool and knows his shit about Vegas!! We ordered 2 burgers, the 1842 and the famous one that won the burger contest (I forget what its called.) Now, its very rare I'd pay $19 for a burger but these (both) were certainly worth it! The 1842 is a hearty angus burger with grilled onions, mushrooms, and truffle oil. TRUFFLE OIL. The burgers come with either salad or fries on the side, and Michael suggested we get one of each and share, as they are pretty large in portion (which was True.) The fries have this \"mystery\" seasoning that's sweet and DELICIOUS. Its some combination of paprika, garlic/onion salt AND brown sugar.   Definitely a place I'd come back to when craving a good ass burger. =)",

My usual choice of sitting at the bar, I was quickly greeted by a man that moved like the Flash. He was serving us so quickly (There were at least 15 people at my side of the bar, and a handful of others at the other end) I had to actively make sure I didn't start addressing him as Barry Allen.  It took about 10 minutes for the arrival of the mac & cheese I ordered. It was a bit small for the cost ($11), but it was very tasty.  Definitely worth the stop for both the food & service.",

I thought it would be just fine since I'm accustomed to bar food, and actually love it. Michael Mina, why did you fail me? You left a lot to be desired.  First off, there was nobody at the front to seat us (and it's a sit down style restaurant, so you can't just go in and seat yourself.) After a few minutes, someone finally came to help us out. It wasn't busy at all, maybe half a dozen tables at best.   We thumbed through the menu and were aghast at the exorbitant prices for bar food. $30 for fish and chips?! Whatever, I was starving so I ordered it anyway. I paired off my entree with a $4 coca cola. The other person at my table had a $15 salad (just seasoned asparagus), which she had the option of adding chicken for $12 more. Needless to say she did not enjoy her meal and was left starving afterward.  Here is the rundown of my dish: Two heavily breaded beer battered flakey fillets on a bed of thick cut fries. I did not enjoy the breading at all. It tasted like Larry the Cable Guy's Beer Batter you can buy at the $.99 Cent Store. The fish was fine, and was flakey with no discoloration. I did not like ANY of the dipping sauces I ordered. They were all watery and gross. The tartar sauce tasted like coleslaw, the BBQ sauce was basically spicy water, and the ranch was watery as well. The fish and chips back home at the Fish Enterprise tastes WAY better and it comes with clam chowder and is HALF the price.  The one positive thing about Michael Mina's Pub 1842 is the service. Once seated, the staff was very friendly. Besides that one positive, I don't think I will ever be back to this place again.  My suggestion to anybody thinking of dining here is to save your $$$ and eat at the food court across from it!",

    "text": "Disappointing barbecue overall. The brisket was tender and somewhat moist, but was was probably prepared in a pressure cooker or oven as it had no smoke flavor, bark, and most obviously no smoke ring. It needed a heavy dose of salt and pepper for at least some flavor. I could understand poor brisket quality from a diner that happens to have brisket on the menu, but this is a barbecue joint on the strip- it should rival Austin's best! To add insult to injury, $22 for two measly slivers of meat, (I estimate about 6 oz), a cornbread muffin and beans  kinda stinks. The only reason this gets 3 stars instead of 2 is that the service was good and they made a great Old Fashioned.",

I shared it with my fiance and I wish I didn't. $18 ex tip and tax. Cooked perfectly. The chef said the the pork is cooked slowly for a day. So tender and delicious. Best I have ever had. I don't know why it is closed on Mondays, cos I wanted to go back! I loved how you can watch meat cook over the wild flames and the chef watches the food as it goes out- Ramsay style.",

I had half the 1842 burger and 1/2 of the bacon cheeseburger...both were AMAZING. Would definitely come here again.   They also have quite the beer selection and if you like (or love..like me) pickles, try their tempura battered pickles. So yummy...the pickle was still crunchy inside, despite being fried.",

We kicked off our meal with the soft pretzels that come with a side of \"beer cheese\" with a poached egg in the middle. The pretzels were nice and warm and you can really taste the beer in the cheese. The egg made no sense and I avoided it like the plague.  I also reached for and bit into what I thought was fried zucchini, only to discover it was a fried pickle. Once I got over my initial surprise, I really liked it!  For dinner, I ordered the Champ burger, which was big, juicy, and messy. It was really good, and I don't know what it was ... maybe the fourth margarita, but I just got tired of eating. May I add, the bun was super soft, if you care about that. Good fries too. Very attentive service and left full and happy. What more can you ask for?",

I had the pre-fix which is a great deal - any burger, a beer, fries and a cookie for $21 - the burgers alone are $16 each.  It is Vegas after all and that prices is not bad.  The burgers are unique for sure.  I had the crunchy peanut butter with ruffled potato chips, bacon jam and pimento cheese and subbed a turkey patty (no beef please).  I loved it, it was different and while I wouldn't do it often it was stick to your ribs tasty.  My friend had a beef burger with truffle and mushroom and loved it except for the bun.  The buns were not that special even though they toast them.  They might have been a little stale except for the toasted part which was sad because the bun can make or break the burger experience.  My bun was meh too.  The fries were nothing special as well, dry, skinny and unappealing - boooooo.  Fix that - fries should leave you wanting more not walking away from a full basket.  I think they call them bbq fries which simply means they put a dry rub sprinkle on them which to me did not enhance or take away from the fries.  The staff was friendly and it was not crowded so they checked on us often.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Bad experience. Specially with the totally uninterested crew. Both the kitchen staff and the waiter.   Arriving around 2030 there was a waiting list for 15 minutes. No problem. We put our name down and (upon suggestion from the hostess) tried to have a drink at the bar. But....the bar was crowd and it seemed not to be possible to get attention to order a drink. Probably we looked a little bit desorientated because one of the waiters asked me whether I was looking for the restrooms. No....looking for a place to wait for our table, preferebly with a drink. He appointed us a table and send a waitress over to take our orders So far, so good.  Ordering dinner also went well. Big selection of beer and (pub)food. But considering it's pubfood, pricy. (Minus one star.) Our party decided to share two appetizers (drumsticks and duck spring rolls) and to go with the hamburgers and a salad as a main course.  First of all: everything arrived at the same time. Hardly fitting the table. Nobody seemed to find that strange. (Minus the second start.) The waiter (very obligatory) asked if everything was good. I answered that we were very dissappointed that every thing was served at the same time. He only nodded and said 'Yeah, that's a bit strange, but I don't know either why THEY did that'. Sorry, I don't like it when staff is blaming each other and is not interested in the guests or in solving the problem. He just walked of. And that was the third star I deducted.  Portion are huge, but I rather have a smaller portion, better prices, a little bit more quality and definetly a much much better staff. More interested in the guests. Both the waiters and the kitchen. There someone could also have noticed that it's strange to serve appetizers and main courses, all hot dishes at the same time. I think the waiter wanted us out in a hurry to get the table free for the next fools. And the big portions only leads to high bills and a lot of waist (think about our planet......).  Drumsticks and springrolls we're good, hamburgers also. The greek salad was very dissappointing. Dry and salt lamb meatballs, too much dressing, too soon poured over the greens so they were weak. I shalln't deducte an extra star for the poor salad because the MGM deserves an extra star because this (although we had a bad experience) is much better than the former fish restaurant that occupied the spot for years.  Update 2016: Things have changed. But nog for the better. Mothersday, 2030, hardly 1/4 off the tables in use. The menu seems to be smaller than before. We both ordered the 1842 Burger after the waiter asked for our choice for the third time in the fitst five minutes. Burger was oke, but expensive ($20). The fries were probably 'gourmet' but not to my liking. A bit sweet. All together: still a 2 star experience. Will not be back.   (Note: I'm no native speaker so excuse all grammar and spelling errors).",

So good if you like a hearty meal.  Service was good, but that was easy at the time we visited.  It's a very accessible restaurant with just a touch of uniqueness.

Much friendlier service and food was a lot more memorable. They do not have a kids menu but everything they have can me accommodated to a kid size. Definitely accommodating with kids. We had the warm spinach salad with salmon and peanut butter crunch burger. I love peanut butter and on a burger was a heavenly combination. The French fries are addicting.

But let us get to the food.  Got the Fish Tacos and Peanut Butter Crunch Burger. Burger was ordered medium, but came out medium well. The edges were charred, the burger slightly cracked and falling apart. The char would have been nice, if the center was a nice pink temp, but it was cooked all through to a muted brown. Flavor was good though. But for $19, there are better burgers to be had in Vegas.  The fish tacos came recommended by the bar tender. So we ordered those too. Wrapped in  standard grocery store tortillas, they were room temp and stale. They could not hold up to the filling inside, as they fell apart one bite into the taco. The fish and mushy, not flaky and tender. The soggy breading lacked much seasoning. Chef, these need to be taken off the menu! Or learn how to heat up corn tortillas and keep the fish crispy. At $24 for 3 tacos, look elsewhere.",

I'm truly surprised to read reviews blasting the waitstaff, as my experience was quite the opposite. We were attended to in a very timely fashion by folks who really seemed to care about the customers' experience.   As for the food - outstanding. It will probably sound silly to rave about a salad in Las Vegas, but the Avocado Kale Caesar is nothing short of amazing. More chefs need to incorporate artichoke chips into their dishes. I ordered the Peanut Butter Crunch burger and it was just as fun as you might imagine based on the menu description. the peanut butter isn't oozing all over the place, but when you get that money bite...well, it's money.

I thought it was a bit dry, but still good.  - Rib eye steak: Fantastic!  Price - vegas pricing standards.  $17-$20 for the burgers with fries.  The steak was like $45, ribs was $34 for the full stack.  Would I come again? You bet ya!",

    "text": "Had dinner here the other night it was a perfect combination of upscale casual food and Michael Mina quality. The Carolina drumsticks were large flavorful and surprisingly sweet with a fresh made blue cheese dressing that is just a perfect combo. The burger which was the the all American bash burger or something to that extent juicy, tender, and packed with so many different angles of flavor. The fries might have been a bit over seasoned but still tasted great. Cocktail wise I had the green monster which was quite refreshing. Then Davey I believe was his name was charming and a great chat for a bartender. Wonderful service.",

Corn on the cob was cold and uninspired. Sad day for us Mina fans. Food lacked flavor and appropriate seasoning. Pickle garnish was wilted and warm and looked too old to be on the plate",

    "text": "I was very excited to taste Michael Mina's new concept. I went with a group of 4, we were sat in a booth close to the hallway. I am aware that they are doing 1,000 covers a day, so I do know that they are in the weeds all day long and the restaurant is turn and burn. We ordered cocktails, and I took the server's advice and ordered the very first one on the cocktail menu. Bad choice, probably one of the worst cocktails I've had, and I love ginger beer so I was very excited, but ended up with lime water.    We all ordered different appetizers to share, fried pickles, pretzels, nachos, lobster corn dog, duck spring rolls, and green chili. The pickle batter, was disappointingly soggy, and the sauce that is served with it was like straight up mayo, but on the upside the lobster corn dog was very good, it didn't sound too great to me but it tasted awesome, crispy batter, tasty center, good sauce too!! The nachos were good, served on a quarter sheet pan which I thought was pretty cool. The duck spring rolls were a little too greasy, and not such a huge fan of the Mae Ploy kind of sauce. The green chili was good , the only thing with all of the appetizers was the temperature, I'm sure they can't hold too many things under the heat lamps due to space and volume, but it all would have been better if it was a bit hotter.   Next, the entrees that we ordered were the chicken, the burger, and a lobster roll, with broccolini and magical mushrooms. the chicken was overcooked, the burger was not too great, the lobster roll was pretty good, nice brioche bun crispy and very filling. The fries that accompanied the roll were exceptionally good, I was full but I could not stop eating them, The broccolini was charred, and the magical mushrooms were inedible, they tasted like someone put a piece of charcoal in your mouth. I'm sure that's not what they were aiming for.   The desserts were both great, we had a lemon cake which we cleaned the plate, and the roasted peach & almond buckle, at this point I could hardly breathe, but still had to try dessert, and I was very glad I did, it was all great.   On another note, our server was great, she was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu, she stopped by constantly to see that we were doing ok. The reason I would not return was the noise level, I realize that there are a lot of people sitting down, but I felt like I was in a sports stadium I had to plug my ears all through the night, because the table behind us was screaming at the TV. Very annoying to have to put up with when all you wanted to do was enjoy dinner with friends. I'm sure they can't do much to fix that though.",

We had several cocktails and beers between the four of us and were quite hungry with several hours before dinner reservations. We ordered the soft pretzels with cheese fondue. The cheese has a poached egg in the middle which at first we were a little nervous about, but oh my word! SO GOOD! The cocktails we had were the punch, their take on a manhattan, and an old fashioned. Each one was perfectly balanced. We will certainly be heading back here on our next trip to Vegas for March Madness!!",

This drink brought my rating down.  Only because it is served in an original Moscow Mule cup, with Fever tree so there are some high expectations.  Missed the mark.  I ordered a second one...missed the mark.  I wasn't too sure why but there was a ton of crushed ice.  I asked the server to have the bartender either half or just hold the ice altogether.  She did and the third drink was what I know as a Moscow Mule. So ice was the culprit.  Wayyyyyyy toooo much ice.  Anyway, back to the food.  Delicious.  We ordered many appetizers and I got the chili and it was good-good.  So I'm torn.  For now I'll do three stars and next time have them hold the ice.",

Do not try the Wagon Wheel it is a sampling of 6 cocktails with a beer chaser and they we mostly awful and barely chilled. The only sample that was drinkable was the Old Fashion.

My wife and I ordered the fried BBQ pork skin, fried chicken and waffles and the Champ burger. Everything was absolutely perfectly executed but so over the top.  The best way I could describe the food is as Paula Dean and Thomas Keller had a love child they would have 1842 pub. For example, their take on the bloody Mary was out of this world (house barrel aged bourbon with two slices of crispy bacon). I wished we could have come back for dinner the next day. But, my heart would have stopped beating from part coronary blockage and part pure joy. Go here if you get a chance.",

I would highly recommend those whose are staying at the MGM hotel & casino to stop by for a bite to eat. The Lobster Corn Dogs are also equally tasteful and delicious. This is one of my favorite restaurants located in the MGM. I have been a regular several times now when staying at MGM.",

In fact, the best scotch in the world, Auchentoshan three wood, because it's aged in a bourbon barrel and the best bourbon,  Rowan's Creek because it's aged in a bourbon barrel. Very impressed and the bartender Liz is amazing. Really enjoyed this place. A hidden Vegas gem, the real deal.",

    "text": "Recently went here with a group for my friends birthday and I was a little disappointed with the service. The good: I ordered the bacon burger and surprisingly it was very good and the portion size was very big. That meal alone kept me full all day long. However, it was way too over priced. I ended up paying $24 in total for a burger and fries no drink, just water because they charge 18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. But what can you expect, it's Vegas. Now the bad part of the service is that I felt rushed when I was there and the people who were tending our table looked like they hated their lives. When they brought out our food it seemed like the guy just threw my friends food on the table instead of placing it down gently. Then when they came back out to refill our cups of water, the guy looked annoyed and just so cold. Not even a friendly smile or anything. Then they came back out shortly after and started trying to clear everyone's plates even though some of us weren't done with our food. Overall I felt like a nuisance and very unwelcomed. Won't be returning to this place.",

    "text": "I visited the Pub 1842 on (2) occasions during my week long stay in Las Vegas, the first experience was marginally acceptable, gave it another chance which was an incremental improvement. On the third attempt, mostly due to lack of casual evening options currently available in the MGM Grand, I ended up walking out due to what I deem to be generally poor attentiveness by the \"General Manager\" and the staff under his charge. I have visited a number of Michael Mina's' restaurants' in various cities along the west coast and had always had an enjoyable experience, when you place a name like Michael Mina on the door of a pub you rightly expect a whole other level of pub. I can't say my experience with Pub 1842 in the MGM Grand met Mina level expectations. I will start with the good:  - location good relative to the MGM hotel layout - nice floorplan and decor  - very good beer selection on tap and bottled - good wine and liquor selection - good menu  - taste of food was good - being a pub, there is a potential to fill what I would opine as a void in venue options absent in most other casino/hotels in Las Vegas, the only other pub I know of is the Ri Ra in between the Mandalay and Luxor, at least as it pertains to casino/hotel interiors.  The average & inconsistent: - Greeters/hosts at front door very average to disappointing, don't look you in the eye when they speak to you, distracted & no smile. I generally felt that they didn't understand that there is a higher level expectation when employed by an establishment bearing Michael Mina's name, hence his reputation. I have to say I have received a higher quality greeting at Hooters establishments.  - Servers in restaurant, while generally friendly, were very inconsistent and NOT knowledgeable about the menu or dishes they are charged with serving to the customers.   - Servers not knowledgeable about the establishment, there is a unique feature in the Pub 1842 in that there are a few taps with seating around them. We inquired of the staff on our first visit how that worked and they replied an uninspiring \"I don't know\" however, a fellow customer overheard us and was kind enough to explain.  - Bartenders and barbacks inconsistently attentive in regards to consistently checking in with customers, was challenging to get their attention, even while not busy, barbacks were of no help to customers where they could have assisted the customers via getting the bartenders attention. Took a long time to get the check and equally as long to process the payment.  The Bad: (In my opinion)  - General Manager, in my opinion, doesn't get it. As previously mentioned I walked out on my third visit over some confusion regarding seating directions from the host staff and generally rude attitude of one of the servers. I attempted to address a gentleman that stated he was the GM, yet, he really didn't introduce himself. I explained the situation and he seemed genuinely disinterested in assisting us, so, we decided to go elsewhere. We ended up at Wolfgang Puck's establishment in the middle of the casino and had a delightful experience, good food and service, despite the fact that my colleagues and myself being very underdressed for the venue, relative to the other patrons.  All that being said, given the nice decor and unique self serve tap feature available there seem like there is some potential for Pub 1842, perhaps a rearrangement of the staff might bring out that potential. In summary, currently, given the gourmet prices I would not return to the Pub 1842's less than gourmet service and would not recommend it until some service improvements are put in place.",

We came back a second time to watch NFL on a Sunday morning since they have a lot of screens.  They didn't have our game on (even though it was available to them) and they refused to change any of the screens - even though there were plenty of empty seats and plenty of screens left unwatched by current customers.  Food: Somewhat decent but very overpriced. The lobster corn dogs sounded interesting but were a joke.  You get three small ones and they're nothing special.  The nachos were on a fairly large platter - but also nothing special.  We ordered ours with pork and we noticed only a couple pieces.  Beer: For a place that uses beer as a selling point, they really fail.  First of all, their beer is listed on the menu from \"lightest to darkest\" which is a complete joke if you know anything about beer.  No mention of beer style or hops... just darkness.  So dumb.  It's clear they know nothing about beer.  They had a couple decent options so I was at least able to drink something.  I couldn't have been more underwhelmed.",

It's one if those items that you have to try once and once you did, you probably wouldn't ever get it again. Took a bite of the 1842 burger and the double smoked double bacon burger.   Those burgers were good.  Nothing  really that special.  I guess the restuarant being a Michael Minna restuarant I had higher expectations.   However,  the duck fat fries were still on point.   Consistent with some of his other restaurants.   Service is always great at all his restaurants and this one was no exception.  Overall not a bad choice to grab a burger and fries.",

    "text": "Great gastropub with a lot of good beers on tap, a diverse menu of delicious food, and excellent and informed waitstaff.    First the precursor: drinks.  Even my super picky dad was able to find more interesting-sounding beers on tap that he could consume in one evening.  After deliberating over a few and settling on one to start, our waiter gave him a taste of one of the others he was considering without any prompting - very thoughtful of him. I tried a couple of their specialty cocktails - both were sweeter than I generally prefer but still delicious, and dang, are they strong!  I'm not complaining, but you can't say you weren't warned.    On to the main event: food. We started by ordering the chicken drumsticks - their spin on wings.  They were huge, smothered in a sweet barbecue sauce, and terribly good.  They give you handiwipes so don't be afraid to dig in.  My dad had the chili and a wedge salad and seemed pleased.  My mom and I went a little off the wall and split the carne asada taco salad and the beef brisket.  The salad was incredible, and they even separated it into two dishes for us so we didn't have to make a mess of it.  The steak comes out VERY rare, and mine even more than my mom's - it was more than edible and very tender, but if you can't deal with truly red meat, you might want to ask them to cook it a little longer.    I was slightly disappointed with how dry the beef brisket was, but my mom thought it was cooked fine and really enjoyed it, so I think it's just a personal preference thing.  We also got a side of mac & cheese and it was excellent - not so overly cheesy that you feel like you're eating a heart attack, like so many fancy chefs seem to favor, and with a little broccoli mixed in.    We were more than sated so we passed on dessert but they sounded adorable - cake & shake combos.   Michael Mina definitely delivers a great dining experience in a casual environment with a classy and tasty take on bar food, while remaining affordable (considering it's in a hotel on the strip).  We'll certainly be back.",

My fiance got the Double Dog Dare which was decent. I got the 1842 Burger. I asked for it medium and instead got it burnt. I could literally taste the burnt outside with every bite. Quite possibly the worst burger I've ever had. I couldn't ask for a new one because I never saw my server. Which leads to my next point.   2. The service was awful. We saw our waiter one time to order and that was it. No drink refills no anything. After having had finished, I waited 15 minutes before finally asking a busser to get our check for us.   3. Lastly I had a 25 dollar gift certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>. I tried to use it on my phone and they wouldn't allow it. Like Groupon there is a button to press to validate it specifically for your phone but they refused. I asked the manager why and he said they just needed a printed page with the same exact code they would put in. Why other restaurants all honor the mobile coupon and they don't, I don't know. But I definitely know this was the worst experience I've ever had and the worst $55 dollars ever spent. Please spare yourselves from this place.",

I can't say that it was necessarily a \"light\" lunch, but it was delicious.  The ambience is really fun, and we sat in a table toward the back of the restaurant where we had plenty of space to relax and unwind after a morning filled with shopping and walking. Our server suggested the Southside to start, and I was intrigued. They only make 15 large jars per day of this drink, so I decided to take advantage of this special drink. It's just beefeater, fresh lemon juice, and mint. Super delicious. Super refreshing. Of course I ordered a second drink. My friend had the pub's version of a moscow mule, and loved it.   We shared the fried pickles, which were perfectly crispy and not greasy at all, and our server recommended the Greek salad and I was requesting \"lighter\" fare.

    "text": "Sure, this celebrity chef joint located along restaurant row in the MGM Grand district area is actually a nifty sports bar to catch a game or grab a comfort food bite to help get over a hangover, but it's also a decent spot to have a good cocktail and burger.  Friendly service in a cozy atmosphere with solid eats. Very laid back and unpretentious. Actually a fun spot. Plenty of flat screens to watch a game. A terrific selection of brews with over 40 selections of beer on tap and in bottles/cans, including ales, stouts and lagers - oh my!  When I was staying at MGM Grand during a biz trip not too long ago I had a night open for dinner so I dropped in here to try it out. Sat at the bar where the bartenders were attentive and took fine care of me.  Had to go with one of their specialties. The PUB 1842 Burger - caramelized onions, mushrooms and truffle aioli. It was $17 which seems a bit pricey but it was really tasty. Cooked just right and juicy. The crispy bbq fries that came with it were a good side. We all know that dining in casinos is always on the pricier end, so it was kind of expected, but at least this was worth it as the portion was pretty large.  Oh, and I washed this down with a properly made sazerac. Why not? They offer some innovative cocktails and adult milkshakes, but I went with a classic.  It is Vegas after all and if I want a sazerac with my burger then so be it!",

Food-wise, the wedge salad is good-the balsamic drizzle along with a lightly creamy but chunky bleu cheese dressing was perfect.   Shrimp & grits was good-blackened shrimp-and the grits were just right texture-wise.   A slice of Andouille made it every better.  My wife had the filet, which came with a tangy chimichuri sauce and a sweet and spicy bbq sauce on the side.   The street corn was a good side to share.  Everything was good and the nacho plate looked awfully good...next time for sure!",

Shouldn't it be the other way around small plates available everywhere and large plates only available at booths and tables. Whatever, I decided to take a look at the menu anyway because I was starving. We came in around 3-4pm on a Sunday, it was EDC weekend so everywhere was pretty crazy. Our waiter was nice, patient and helpful. We all ordered water, beer and drinks.   I ordered a michelada because I came here one other time but we sat at the bar and the girl that made our michelada made is spicy and delicious. This time it wasn't. All I tasted was Clamato   We all went on to order food. We got the following:   Nachos- Huge plate, they were shared with the whole table. They had pork, guac, sour cream, beans pico de gallo and cheese. Probably the best plate.   BBQ drumsticks- We ordered 2 of these thinking \"Oh we can share with everyone\" WRONG!!!! The order only came with 3 and they were served with blue cheese. GROSS  Beef Brisket- not the greatest. It tasted microwaved. The corn bread was good though. Beans were ok but not enough to finish them  Overall, I consider this meal to have been a waste of calories. I really want to come back and try the small plates because they look delicious.",

I love their cocktails--had the Heist (Bulleit bourbon, passion fruit-lemongrass syrup, vanilla, and fresh lemon juice, with fresh cracked black pepper on top), which was sweeter than I normally go for, but interesting and delicious. They had a special version with strawberry peppercorn syrup as well, and that one was tasty, too. They do barrel-aged cocktails, which is an interesting concept, but the only one I tried was way too sweet for me (Sin City, with Buffalo Trace whiskey, Green Chartreuse, keffir lime syrup, and a gold leaf garnish). The Soda Popinski from the Fizzy-Lifting section of the menu (their version of a Moscow Mule--Grey Goose, fresh lime, ginger beer), was refreshing and balanced.  As far as food, the 1842 nachos were fantastic! They're cheaper during happy hour, and a ridiculously large serving--an entire tray of tortilla chips with big chunks of braised pork, cheddar cheese sauce, black bean and jicama relish, with pickled fresno peppers. Super flavorful.  Love this place for happy hour!",

My husband and I ordered the bbq bacon burger and the fried bbq bourbon chicken sandwich with fried pickles and beers to start. The beers came out cold and in nice thirst quenching mugs. Next came the fried pickles. These were 'alright' but I thought they were very heavy, and the dough was not cooked all the way through, which left a soggy inner coating around the pickle. Our burgers came out immediately afterwards and we began chowing down. After a few bites my husband described his sandwich as a bad Chinese restaurants general tso's.  The breading on the chicken was tasteless. The burger I received was a small step above a Chili's burger. Did I mention that each burger was $20? I don't mind $20 burgers, in fact I love Gordon Ramsay's new restaurant Burger. If you're going to have a $20 burger on the menu, it should definitely taste like a $20 burger",

Is it $17 great, for a local, who had to walk a half a mile from the parking garage for it? Eh, not really. If you are like me going for the burger, it makes sense to do the $18.42 deal, where you get fries and a drink too. (or a shake or a cookie, depending on your mood) The burger came with grilled onions, mushrooms, and truffle. It was a big burger, but honestly if I were to dine here again, I would probably go for something else.  We also went for a frickles appetizer. I am sure you can guess a frickle is a fried pickle. They were average. Nothing that really stood out.  This place would be good for a happy hour with the girls. It is the only time I could justify returning. Even the happy hour cocktails were $6-$8. Coming from a girl who grew up in Vegas, and could go to Ellis Island for $1 drinks 24/7, that just does not seem like a happy hour to me. Forgive me for being cheap. I don't mind going to touristy style places and spending more for something spectacular. For something that makes my mouth water at the thought of it. But for average burgers, not so much.  We are talking MGM here, where within steps you can dine at Emeril's, or Wolfgang's. Mr. Mina, I would say step your game up just a touch. Lower the price to be a casual pub, or offer something fancy to fit in with your surroundings. Just my opinion. Have to love us Yelpers and our opinions.",

The place had and atmosphere that was warm, inviting, and fun. Good place to watch a game. We ordered the tomato soup with grilled cheese sandwiches, pulled pork sandwich w/cabbage, split and two Dragons Milk Beers. Tomato soup was outstanding but the grilled cheese sandwich was average. The pulled pork sandwich was the star of the show. The meat was super tender, wonderful flavor, and with the cabbage brought all together for savory goodness. The seasoned fries that came with, were crispy and tasty. Had a great time, great food, and we will most definitely eat there again. Thank you, Carlos for making our visit great!",

It is an 8 oz. beef patty. It tastes salty and sweet. I would say that the taste is unique and it grows on you after each bite. I didn't love it or hate it. The fries were good too with the way they were seasoned. It also takes time to prepare , so just relax and chill before your meal arrives. The total damage came to $25.00 with a drink. Remember, Vegas is expensive now so just roll with it. I would eat here again.",

The Mac and cheese is so rich and creamy, definitely well thought out with the crunch of crispy fried onionsin there and cheese for miles. HELLO. Do it.

We sat at the bar, and service was good. I tried iceberg lettuce wedge for $7, pork tacos for $8, Turkey burger, and tater tots for $9 minus the bacon. Iceberg wedge is good, would have enjoyed bacon on it and less dressing. Pork tacos were great, flavorful, and definitely had a kick. Tater tots were just okay, may have been better with the bacon, but my husband doesn't eat bacon. Turkey burger was good, just a bit too much aioli dressing that overwhelmed the burger. Our food took a while to come out, even though they didnt seem too busy. Overall an \"okay\" experience.",

Waitress was a little over the top for me, just did not stop talking when we sat down, but she was passionate about the food and I can appreciate that.   Beer selection was good, service was fast and the place was almost empty on a wednesday afternoon. Works for me.  Will come back next time I am in town for sure. Keep up the good work guys",

We also tried the nachos, the pretzel and the pub tots, all of which were great. The service was excellent, it is a good little hang out. They also have a happy hour, but it's not like your typical happy hour. There aren't discounted drinks, just some different beers and food during that period of time, that isn't normally offered.  One thing on the negative side, the bar stools are incredibly uncomfortable. My wife and I both had our legs fall asleep and we ended up standing a good portion of the time.  We will definitely go back, when in Vegas.",

There was an important game on and we wanted to eat somewhere where we could watch it and there were TVs every few feet on the walls. Despite there being so many screens the decor was not compromised and it felt very relaxed and classy all at the same time. The table was wood and we were fives real cloth napkins.   My partner and I started with the California salad which had the most delicious seasoned cashews and was definitely large enough for two.   My entree consisted of the bacon burger and I replaced my side with the macaroni and cheese which was topped with crunchy onions.   The burger was phenomenal and had the most delightful melted cheese and complimented with barbecue sauce.   The mac n cheese, despite burning my mouth because it was so hot, was spicy creamy and comforting.   I nibbles on my partners French fries which had a bbq seasoning and were thin with just the right amount of crunch. They were the best French fries I have ever eaten.   Would I return? Absolutely!",

    "text": "Last visited in early 2016, the Sin City smoked Meats scene dramatically improved since that time by Big B's Texas BBQ, it was lured in by an all-new Brunch menu that four guests sat down inside Michael Mina's PUB 1842 on Saturday, Tony Schutz having moved up the ladder to toque STRIPSTEAK in the interim but Chef Isaiah Utter still showing Las Vegas Boulevard that when done right \"Bar Food\" can be innovative...though like many casino Restaurants it comes at a price.  Surprisingly now in its sixth year of business but still sort of under-the-radar given its location, a turn past Emeril's in The District not far from Grand Garden Arena, it was minutes prior to noon that a table just inside the door was found with a placard labeled \"RESERVED,\" an unnecessary accommodation during the off-season for most sports as the space would never even reach 1/8 capacity over the course of ninety minutes.    Greeted promptly by new staff, both male and female managers professional yet pleasant while a young server named Miguel showed the sort of skill that would be well suited to a Steakhouse or next-tier Restaurant such as Bardot, it was from a menu of old favorites and new creations that Brunch would begin a slow roll-out, eight Cocktails served in two \"flights\" starting things off with both a fizzy Sangria and the Fruit-forward Dorsey favored by those imbibing.    Served family-style in two courses, the first comprised of sticky Chicken Legs with thick Blue Cheese dipping Sauce plus a pair of favorites available all the way back during visit number one in October 2013, suffice it to say that no Pretzel in the Valley has yet to trump PUB 1842's that comes ready to be dredged in Beer Cheese floating a poached Egg and Bacon while layers of Nachos laid out like abstract art also perform as strong today as when initially devoured in full rather than half-size portion.  Not at all a \"cheap\" Restaurant, even Michael Mina's ingredient quality and skilled staff seeing it difficult to justify prices more than double that of some competitors, it was momentarily suspending reality that $28 Hash landed in Cast Iron and impressed by way of crisp yet succulent Beef amidst Peppers and Onions plus tender Potatoes, the two-Egg topping helping to meld flavors here but on the other hand muting them in the case of Pulled Pork and smoky Cream atop a fluffy Waffle that would have been nice to taste without all the sog-inducing additions.   Given the opportunity to next sample Brisket, Pulled Pork and Ribs as smoke and fire intended, the shredded Pig again sweeter than preferred and perhaps one reason to consider the aforementioned Waffle more successful than on first bite, it would be tough to name better Ribs in recent memory than those Utter sent out while the fatty Brisket goes neck and neck with Big B's for best in the area, though the mom n' pop location in Henderson still easily takes the title for Beans.  Remembering a time when some of Mina's Restaurants served complimentary Cornbread instead of one small Muffin meant to be shared it was assuming the Waffle was as delicious that a side of Sweet Potatoes showed just how good PUB 1842 can be at its best, the textures and flavors all complex and complimentary just as they were in the lone Dessert titled \"Campfire S'mores\" while the $21 Monte Cristo had all the right elements but too much Batter and frying time that led to it being even heavier than usual.  THREE STARS: Somehow even more expensive than memory serves it is not so much that PUB 1842 has diminished in quality as it is that others have caught up, nearly every dish save for the Pretzels available elsewhere either better, cheaper or both though  the service and setting both continue to set a high standard.",

    "text": "Horrific meal and experience. I expected much much more from a Michael Mina restaurant, especially with the pricing of the menu. Having never been to one before and hearing all good things we were excited to try it out.  We waited 20 minutes to get seated even though there were plenty of open tables. Once seated it took 10 minutes to get waters brought out. The server came to the table and immediately asked for our order, not hello my name is, not does anyone have any questions..... \"are you ready to order\". We ordered 2 kids sliders, 2 wedge salads (one no onions or shallots) and a cheese burger with no onions, add pickles. My wife is HIGHLY allergic to raw onions, hence we asked for no onions on her food. We also asked for one wedge to be brought out first. Wouldn't you know, it comes out covered in onions and shallots. I let the server know we can not eat this one and need a brand new one made because of the allergy. 10 minutes later a new salad comes out. We have now been seated for 30 minutes. 20 minutes after that our food is still not out. I have 2 hungry kids and it is taking way too long to make sliders and a burger cooked medium. The rest of the food finally comes out.... wouldn't you know there is onions on the burger and no pickles. I am beyond frustrated at this point. I ask for the manager and the server takes the burger to have a new one made. To make matters worse, the kids sliders are more like hockey pucks. Not charred, they are burnt. I hand them to the manager once he comes to the table and ask for new ones to be made. All the food finally comes out and is at least somewhat edible. The manager however, he was no where to be found. He never came back . The server was embarrassed and I was livid. The server then asked us to come back and ask for him so he can take care of us again. UUUUMMM NO! All in all we had a horrible dinner and 30 mins later everyone was hungry.   Very overrated as a restaurant. Had too many other great meals here in Vegas to even think about returning here.",

    "text": "I have been a guest of the MGM Grand for 30 years and a gold member. 99% of the time I'm happy. It was during my third stay in the past month that I stopped at Pub 1842 with my guests in tow for dinner. We were turned away at 9:59pm because they said they were closing. They had seated a couple less than one minute beforehand, we watched em being seated as we approached. Was it the time or do they just dislike \"larger people\"...I don't know. We left hungry and went to Wolfgang Puck instead. As we left we felt oddly singled out, as if we \"didn't belong there\" and one of the members of our group mentioned that the hostess was like the saleswoman who told Julia Roberts in PRETTY WOMAN, \"I don't think we have anything for you, you're obviously in the wrong place. Please leave.\"  I dismissed it as us just being hangry...but seriously, 10pm in Vegas is when things are kicking off, not closing and we did arrive before the actual stated closing time, albeit by one minute.  So the next afternoon we returned to Pub 1842 and give them a second chance. My wife I and got there a few minutes ahead of our guests who were on a different floor of the hotel than we were. I requested a table for four and was asked if my entire party was here. I explained that my guests were en route to meet us at the Pub and was curtly told that they \"will not seat us unless the entire party is present.\" Now we're senior citizens, my wife has bad knees (bone on bone) and it was obvious we needed to sit down. We aren't dressed up cuz it's 115 degrees outside but we aren't dressed like bums either (I'm wearing a Rolex, my wife has a 10ct diamond ring on and she's carrying a huge Louis Vuitton purse. I explained that our guests would be down in a few minutes and we needed to sit, that my wife wasn't well.\" It was what happened next that convinced me this establishment is prejudiced and discriminatory of big people. My wife & I (if combined) weigh nearly 460lbs. You can tell when you look someone in the eye if they are reciting policy or looking at you with disapproving eyes. This little girl enjoyed refusing us a table. I hope your orthodontist over-tightens your arc wire next time sweetie. We were not welcome at Pub 1842 period. I was so upset when I left the second time I started drafting this letter in my head as we then met up with our guests and headed to Emeril's where we had a spectacular lunch.   My advice to all you folks who aren't \"the pretty people\" and don't meet the \"Hollywood criterion\" esthetically...don't stop at the Pub. They take too much joy turning people like you away. I have never experienced such blatant discrimination in my life. You better be young, attractive and trim if you want a table here buster. The irony being us older folks are generally far better tippers and ya know what? We frequently post reviews too.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d4455079-r693914934-Michael_Mina_Pub_1842-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=d92f4cf9bdd31dcfb24b0c53a6f443a041b08e48d7cedd0fc14e36a70b5e979a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

One friend ordered nachos and I have to say they were a unique, flavorful take on this traditional bar favorite. We also had their Homemade Frickles (fried pickles) and they were good too.  I had the Green Chili - Heritage Pork and liked it a lot. Good flavor and not too salty. Some places seem to use salt as their main ingredient for soups and chili, not here!  The price is pretty steep for bar food. But you're going to have a great food experience in a nice atmosphere, so the trade off is probably worth it.",

I expected yet another clone of the casual yet fancy Pub-ish places. I was expecting good, but not WOW! Great  The food was basic with a twist but not so much that it made the food weird. I had the basic Pub burger on Jennifer's request and she was dead on right. While she was making drinks for the servers she continued to tell us about the standards of their drinks and food and beer.  I go to a lot of places in this town and see a lot of lackluster bartenders going through the motions. That always amazes me. It was refreshing to see someone taking pride in her craft and really make sure the guest felt at home and welcomed.  My only criticism is the uniform. I saw a lot of female workers wearing attractive tank-tops that looked like they were made for females yet Jennifer was wearing what amounted to a potato sack shapeless men's t-shirt. I'm not expecting Pub 1842 to be \"Hooter\" (wouldn't go there if it were) but please have the women wear the women's uniform.  As long as Pub 1842 continues to have top line food, craft beer and drinks and workers like Jennifer,  Pub 1842 will do great in Vegas.",

I loved the atmosphere, the mason jar water glasses, and the Kings Cup instructions on the place mats. The waitress was TOO friendly. I'm here visiting my sister from out of town trying to catch up with her and our waitress is telling me her life story. I could tell you where she's from, age, and how many kids she has and their ages. Anyway it was happy hour but they had such a random few of choices for beers and cocktails it turned us off for drinks completely and stuck with waters. Taking a look at the menu it was totally changed from what we saw online and nothing that we went there to try (like lobster corn dogs) were left, everything else didn't look as appealing as the previous menu. So we ordered the fried cauliflower that was good but came soggy and we were hoping for crispy since it was fried. The menu also described it as hot but it was extremely sweet like candy!! We decided to try something else so we ordered the brisket sliders next. The bun wasn't warm or really soft, I think the greens in them were kale which I didn't feel like it belonged, but the brisket itself was good but once again really sweet! At this point we weren't in the mood for dessert from all the sugar in what we already ate. The bill came in another mason jar and even though I had nothing to drink, I still almost put the check with my money into my water! Lol My rating is due to the sweetness, and everything that was just wrong about the food (but it wasn't bad! Just not good) and the fact that the happy hour drink menu as well as the regular menus just stunk compared to what we were originally excited for.",

Every casino has very similar restaurant offerings and after having a most disappointing experience at Burger Bar the night before I feared I was in for similar here.  Not the case.  We really enjoyed our experience at 1842. We had two appetizers and two 17oz drafts (I had the MOA pale ale and she had the (NAME ESCAPES US) porter). The food was an order of their pretzels and cheese w/ poached egg. This was AMAZING. I could have eaten it all night. The second appetizer we had were the nachos which had a sweet corn salsa on top. This too was amazingly good.  After our nosh we went out and did a little gambling and then returned in about an hour to have another drink at the bar. I revisited the MOA and she asked the bartender if she could make her a chocolate martini. The bartender answered in a half-hearted \"sure\" and proceeded to make a watered down, non-garnished mixed drink for $12. She had over-shaken the drink, thus making it very watery (rookie mistake). Ok, this was the ONLY thing that sucked about our experiences. For that kind of cash add some damn flare to the drink. It is not beyond reason to garnish with some chocolate shavings or syrup.  So, despite the lackluster mixed drink everything was awesome. They lose a star on the drink, but retain 4 strong stars and a promise that we will return in the near future. If you are a fan of beer and tasty-twists on pub fare favorites this place is for you.  *UPDATE*  I am going back and giving this place 5 stars.  My wife and I revisited 1842 the next night for a snack and a nightcap. After a day of playing pinball and visiting Old Vegas we thought a revisit was needed. We were glad we went back.  The wifey ordered a Guinness and I had another MOA, both were 17oz and ice cold delicious. We then ordered the pretzels and cheese dip w/ poached egg, again. Absolutely awesome. It was satisfying and set us in the right mode to get some rest (pinball is a vicious sport).  We were quite fortunate to get our server from the first night, Juan O. A great guy that is very accommodating. Props.  OK, that's it. I think you get it and should give this place a try if in the neighborhood.",

After meh buffet last night we wanted good food. Mission accomplished! Started with calamari. Absolutely tender and wonderful. Didn't even need dipping sauce. Also got BBQ drumsticks. Think deep fried wings but full sized drumsticks. 5 to an order. We couldn't finish. All portions were enormous!! I got the 1842 burger ($20) and was phenomenal. Truffle aioli, sauteed shrooms and blue cheese. The brioche bun was the best! My mom got the Korean salmon sandwich ($18) and it was amaze balls. The cucumber kimchee and flavorful sauce was just absolutely fabulous. My son got the fish and chips ($22). 2 huge portions of cod and the most crispy steak frites I've ever had! The service was exceptional. Pen was so accommodating and answered all of our questions and perfectly described the dishes. My water glass never got half empty (and I drink A LOT of water!!). I also got a mule ($13) and it was wonderful. Will absolutely make Michael Mina restaurants a must stop!!",

The super buttery and crispy crustless sandwich is served on top of a small cup of fries.  The fries themselves were also great, and had a sweet sugary taste complimenting their saltiness.  Only thing really keeping them from 5 stars: My water was refilled only once, and it was dry most of the time.  Their sound kept going in and out for some strange reason.  I didn't mind it mostly being off as I don't care much for loud environments.  For $9, I was happy with the food.  If they can either use larger water glasses or refill more often, I'd be a happy diner.  As long as a rowdy sports game isn't going on.",

It was only $10 to my surprise, had a few of those, didn't even bother to try other drinks!

Before I start though I will say the service was excellent.  We ordered the \"frickles\" or fried pickles. This might be my fault because I read that they were pickle spears and I know that medallions of breaded pickles are more flavor balanced, but I thought I would give it a try. They ended up being heavily breaded and probably right off the frozen food truck. Yuck. Our server suggested the nachos. He said they are known for their nachos. The tin that looked like a small cookie sheet was out in about 3 minutes. How unappetizing is that. I couldn't even see a chip. It was all a gooey velveta mess and they didn't even microwave it long enough. We sent it back and they redid it. Terrible, awful very bad. We quit ordering. Funny thing was, there was a family dining right next to us and they seemed to be enjoying.  I don't care where I go, but if someone is cooking for me I expect fresh food. Not something right off a frozen food truck",

A friend of mine had the barbeque chicken burger... he's still talking about it as the \"best chicken burger ever\" -- and that guy loves his chicken burgers.

The food was fresh and put together with love and care but not very impressive and I did not like it. The calamari was good on the inside but the reading tasted too pulverized and while it was crisp it soaked up too much oil. The marinara was not tasty. That smiley flavor is no good. The bacon Gouda burger was sweet and didn't taste savory like a burger should. It had the same flavor or something as the smoked marinara and the same as the fries. Everything kind of had the same \"tone\". Even the bacon on the burger tasted the same as the beef, the seasoning on the sauce and the same as the fries. There was no contrast in the flavors of the food. My tongue was bored.  Neither me or my husband even ate half of our burger. I will say that the salad was amazing. The salad dressings were fantastic. Tasted homemade and delicious. I will be thinking about the ranch and the vinaigrette for a while. Those really were the best part of lunch.",

    "text": "This place is located inside of the MGM Grand and is not only affordable, but delicious! I think we all can agree that Vegas can have some overpriced restaurants, but this place is the perfect marriage between delicious and affordable.  I came here though the suggestion of a close friend of mine, who was eager to come here. When we approached the restaurant, the hostess warmly greeted us, and gave us some suggestions on her favorite menu items. When we finally sat down, our server IMMEDIATELY greeted us and gave us water. He was well informed, clear, efficient, and funny. My friend and I decided to go for their burger special which includes any burger, a drink, and a cookie for $18.42 (so cute given the name!)  My friend ordered the bacon burger, and I ordered the 1842 burger. If you like a simple burger, go for the bacon burger. If you want a burger that is messy, filled with stuff, and bursting with flavor, get the 1842 burger. The fries were equally as delicious as the burger, and the cookie that came with the deal was soft, warm, and soooo good. I must say, I was impressed. Food came out quickly, and the burgers were perfectly medium-well.  If I return to vegas, I will definitely return here. Trust me, the calories are worth it.",

Great atmosphere.  Deff a good place to go if you are into sports and want to watch the games.  There are T.V's everywhere.  It was a bit noisy so if you are looking for a quiet place this is not the place for you.  Now lets get to the food.  We started with the deep fried pickles they were very good.  I ordered a burger and let me tell you it was amazing.  Its was huge, tasty, juicy.  The highlight had to be the fries.  The fries were seasoned with bbq powder which gave a huge twist the fries.  I know there are tons of places to eat in Vegas but if you at the MGM you need to try this place.",

The server was semi fast.  The water guy was very fast and nice.  To the hostess's credit I think she felt that she had to put it into a computer system in order to assign the table properly. That might've been a little bit of overkill seeing as how they were 50 people in line.  But that's how she was trained I guess. A bit robotic but procedure is procedure.

The pub was a nice, inviting restaurant with good service and a warming welcoming feel.  Service was ok and friendly but not as attentive as it could be.

It's a long walk through the casino and past quite a few restaurants but you'll eventually find it.  I'm glad we did because we were pleasantly surprised.  They have a pretty big bar and semi-big restaurant space.  We had a short wait on a Monday evening.  I love fish and chips and they have them on the menu here.  When I asked our server if he recommended that or the Sweet and Spicy Glazed Salmon, he recommended the salmon because it had more flavor and wasn't a huge portion.  Ok, I shouldn't be eating all that fried food anyways so I chose the salmon.  The salmon was delicious and flavorful.  It was also cooked perfectly and was served on a cabbage salad.  Great for me because, less carbs.  My husband had the Bourbon BBQ Chicken sandwich.  He thought it was really good.  I got a small bite of the chicken and it was super tasty.   Overall, this is a cool place to grab a bite to eat in the MGM.",

The beer flights give you lots of flexibility to sample four of your choice, and there is an interesting menu, with excellent burger options. We also really like the salmon dip appetizer which was plenty for several people to share. Service was quick.",

    "text": "I love me some Michael Mina restaurants- so after finding out this was a Michael Mina restaurant, I almost didn't believe it - because the bartenders are not that great here. They don't really check in and there's a slight wait on seconds and thirds for drinks because their too busy talking amongst the other workers instead of serving drinks. Hopefully that changes...  Came in during Happy Hour which is from 2-5, including Saturday's (that's cool). Usually HH is only on weekdays, so hey - this is a plus.   Sat at the bar, didn't get greeted right away- but after a few minutes our bartender gave us menus and some recommendations. We ordered two rounds of Lucky 7's since they were on the Happy Hour menu, plus they were only $7/each. The first time round, our drinks were pretty tasty, they also had a ton of ice which made it refreshing. The second round it was a different guy who made it, and then we noticed it had less ice. The second round of drinks tasted horrible, as if no alcohol, way too much soda and hardly any ice. I will be sure to stick to Jameson Diets for next visit.",

    "text": "While on our way to Topgolf - Las Vegas, we stopped in for brunch at this pub.  During past trips, we've dined here for lunch or dinner but never fo breakfast so we took this time to try it out.  We were seated immediately and we perused the menu that the hostess gave to us.  Our server, Abel, approached us within two minutes after being seating to take our beverage order as we all ordered coffee and water to get started.  Because we took note of the Michael Mina recipe for Old Fashioned on the placemat, Abel mentioned their special \"Barrel Roll\" container.  The Barrel Roll is a small aging barrel that serves 4 in which  their bartender will fill with your choice of House barrel aged cocktail (Bottom of the Barrel or Old Fashioned).  Very tempting BUT it wasn't even noon when we arrived.  Haha.  Admittedly, we're not big breakfast eaters and prefer to wait for brunch so we decided to share our generously portioned dishes among the 3 of us.  FOOD: -Avocado & Lobster Toast:  Maine lobster, guacamole, cucumber, breakfast radish, lemon vinaigrette.   The toasts were piled high with avocado, lobster, tomato and frisee.  They were quite the delicious and luxurious mouthful. $19  -Shrimp & Grits:  Anson Mills white cheddar grits, grilled shrimp, Hobb's thick-cut bacon, poached egg and chives.  Abel highly recommended this dish for its flavorful and consistency grits.  The grilled shrimp and thick-cut bacon were cooked perfectly which added to the mouthfeel and enhanced the cheesy flavor of grits.  $24  -Monte Cristo:  Country ham, roasted turkey, smoked Gouda cheese, Swiss cheese and raspberry chipotle compote.  Holy smokes...I wasn't expecting such a large basket of crisp, delicious and well-seasoned fries to accompany this rich American variation of croque monsieur.   This sandwich brought a \"flavor party\" to breakfast.  $21  We enjoyed Michael Mina's Pub 1842 on this trip as much as we have in the past.  So glad they're still doing well.",

I got the Turkey Burger and my husband got the bacon burger- both with a side salad. My Turkey burger was delicious. It came with guacamole, arugula, and the bun was nicely toasted. I'd definitely get that again. My husband got the bacon burger and he said he'd get it again. The prices weren't back at all! My Turkey Burger was $19, the bacon burger was $20.

This was my third visit to Pub 1842 and it was with 3 friends that got together for brunch.  We had a reservation and the chef was given the OK to send out dishes  as he decided for the table.  First, two of our group order two cocktail flights.  They had mixed reactions to the drinks in strength and in taste but I can't judge that.  The items that we got were (with menu descriptions):  BBQ chicken drumsticks--Carolina bbq sauce, celery sticks, blue cheese dressing Hot soft pretzels--'merican beer cheese, poached egg, crumbled bacon, chives 1842 nachos--pork chili verde, shredded cheddar, 'merican cheese sauce pico de gallo, black bean relish, fresnos, crema, green onions BBQ sampler platter--baked beans, cabbage slaw, jalapeno corn bread Sweet potatoes--maple-chipotle cream cheese, pecan streusel sea salt Smoked beef brisket hash--fried potatoes, jalapeno, red bell peppers, caramelized onions, bbq aioli, two over easy eggs The pig and the waffle--cheddar chive cornbread waffle, Carolina bbq pulled pork, two over easy eggs, chipotle crema Monte Cristo--country ham, roasted turkey, smoked gouda cheese swiss cheese, raspberry chipotle compote Campfire S'more bar--devil's food cake, toasted marshmallow graham cracker crust  I am a sucker for soft pretzels and the beer cheese with the addition of thje poached egg made for an excellent dip for the pretzels.  This could be the beginning and end of my brunch experience because I'd eat them all.  I am not much of a BBQ person so I tasted some of the pulled pork but took a pass on the ribs.   I can also recommend the smoked beef brisket hash but it comes at a hefty price of $23 for the skillet of hash.  The Pig and the waffle was a good item but the Monte Cristo was something I'd skip in the future.  It had way too much breading for my taste.  The cheese, ham, and turkey were lost in the breading.  The S'more bar was OK and a good way to end the meal.  Given its location and the Strip pricing, Pub 1842 is not a place that I'd recommend meeting friends from out of town.  While the food is good, the prices don't justify the trip here.  When I heard what our share of the bill was, I thought I misheard at first.  I didn't.",

We were waiting to talk to the hostess about sitting at a table but the hostess was talking to someone for 5 minutes so I suggested to my friend that we should just sit at the bar. We walked in and luckily there were a few spaces left.   Bartender asked what we wanted to drink and was very attentive in the beginning. He took our drink order and our food order and we waiters about two minutes for our drinks to come out and 15 minutes for our food.   The turkey burger was amazing like I said in the beginning. Tasty, juicy and not dry and even with the greens on top it didn't take away from the flavor. It was a bit bready for me but that's because I'm on a diet. You can order protein style if you want but I wanted to try the bread which was soft and an excellent pair for the turkey.   Service was ok after that. My friend had to walk up to the bartender to get his attention after we tried waving him down 4 times (and there were 2 other people working the bar besides him). He never gave us an itemized receipt so that was annoying because how did I know my meal was x amount? Luckily I'm a math teacher and figured it out that it was correct. Overall, I liked the food and the \"famous fries\" that says it was spicy isn't spicy at all.",

You'll be able to get a drink if you are at a table and ordering food. The food is good -- the hamburgers are well made and seasoned, and the salads are fresh and easily enough for 2 people. The waitstaff is hit or miss -- I had a very nice server the last time I was there (March 2015) who was friendly and professional.

Everything was tasty especially the brisket Benedict and their fries are nicely seasoned with herbs and cooked just right.  I would definitely revisit to try many of the other tempting menu items like the lobster corn dogs.  Don't expect anything too fancy here but it's all well prepared and a comparable price to other places like it considering the location.  $16 for brisket Benedict, $19 for the champ burger with fries, $26 for fish and chips, and $14 for a salad isn't cheap but that's probably due to location.",

I forget what we ordered (sorry) but everything was really good. It wasn't the best place I've ever eaten in but it was OK. The bar is large and they have tables with beer taps in the center so groups can pour their own beer at their leisure. There were TVs all around. There were food runners aside from the waitresses and everyone was very accommodating.",

    "text": "At first glance 1842 has a nice 'old' pub style to its interior, but upon closer inspection it feels not much better than a glorified Applebee's. There are some neat light fixtures, but lots of hard surfaces, mostly oversized booths and a really odd back bar make this for a strange replacement to the classy interior that was Nobhill. The restaurant is located in the middle of restaurant row and picks up huge crowds from the convention center and MGM Grand Arena, so plan accordingly if you're there during a peak period. I was there on a weekday at noon and was able to get a seat right away, but just 10 minutes later some convention broke for lunch and there was a line out the door. There are way too many items to list on the menu, but many of them sound great. Now that I've gotten a burger out of the way, I'll have to head back for the fried homemade pickles and lobster corn dogs at a minimum.  Out of the several burgers they offer, I went with the one that sounded the most interesting, the peanut butter crunch burger with bacon jam and potato chips. Upon first bite I was hit with a fantastic beef and char flavor that instantly brought me back to the Nobhill burger I enjoyed so much, but things changed a bit from there. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this burger but it had some flaws if I'm going to be my nit-picking self. The bun was a bit too thick and dry, which didn't help with a burger that has peanut butter as one of its main toppings. As I said the meat had excellent flavor, was cooked well, but this was not a juicy patty at all. The bacon jam had great flavor, and really paired well with the potato chips even though you can't taste them too well in the mix. Overall this assembly is just naturally not very moist, and loses something for me. The two people I had lunch with both ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and theirs looked so much juicier than mine. I'd love to come back and sample both that one and the 1842 burger in the near future. All of the right flavors are there; I know they can most likely still produce something fantastic.  Unfortunately the fries seemed somewhat of the generic frozen variety; they weren't quite as good as before, but had a good rosemary flavor and were cooked well. I really wished for something a little more original when paired with something as odd as a burger with bacon jam, peanut butter and potato chips on it. As for the price, $17 seems way too steep for this burger, with a couple of them at $18 on their menu. I understand that this is a convention centric dining spot, and I get that strategy, but it's still a bit hard to cough up that kind of money for a burger. Plus if you consider that their last restaurant, which was arguably fancier and more intimate served what was possibly a better burger for $15, it makes this a bit more troubling. Regardless, Pub 1842 seems to have quite a good menu, and seems to offer several really good burgers, so if you're at MGM Grand you probably won't find a better offering.",

We were pleasantly surprised by the portion size and oh the taste of the burgers were so good. My felafel burger did not look too appealing at first but I fell in love with it on the first bite. Love at first bite! The fries were out of this world amazing! We've never had fries cooked like that before. The seasoning used was very yummy. We were very happy with the service as well. For an easy no fuss meal, this place is the place to go. We were disappointed that it was closed on our last day at the MGM. Would have loved to have another burger before we went back home.",

    "text": "My husband and I are big fans of Michael Mina and his newest venture did not disappoint.    We went in and sat at the bar last Friday night - opening weekend.  There was a good crowd but we were still able to grab a couple of the last seats when we showed up just before 6:00 p.m.  Overall, the staff was friendly and service was good.  The bartender seemed a little bit overwhelmed, but she was handling the crowd and the drink menu well.  Michael Mina's drink lists (here and at his other restaurants) demand a bit more out of his bar staff than many other restaurants.  Nonetheless, she was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, the drinks, and Chef Mina's cuisine generally.  Chef Mina was expediting that night and was working - not there just for show and glad-handing.  He came over to speak to us briefly (and was very gracious) but quickly returned to work.  We saw him send a couple of dishes back and seemed to lay eyes on every dish that went out while we were there.  We observed him interacting with his  kitchen staff and his wait staff about service.  The drink list is a little more accessible than his other Vegas restaurants - more beer and \"fru-fru\" drinks (smaller drink menu and not focused as much on old school whiskey and gin cocktails).  I had the Heist and the Jungle Juice.  The Heist was a fantastic cocktail - great fresh strawberry flavor but without being overly sweet.  The Jungle Juice was a bit sweet for my tastes, but a good drink.  My husband had the Old White and an Old Fashioned.  Oddly, the Old White came in a shot glass, but was a very good drink.  The Old Fashioned was superb.  We started with the Crispy Chicken Drumsticks with chipotle lime glaze and the Homemade Frickles.  Both were excellent.  The chicken consisted of four regular sized drumsticks (not drumettes), which were amazingly crispy and the chipotle lime glaze was both spicy and flavorful.  The fried pickles were battered, light, and crispy, but the batter didn't overwhelm the pickle.  We tried to order the Lobster Corn Dogs, but they were already out (it was about 6:30).    For entrees, I had the Lobster Roll and my husband had the Peanut Butter Crunch Burger.  The lobster roll was very good - a good portion of lobster mixed with creamed corn, popcorn for a little texture, on an oversized Parker Roll.  Not quite a knife and fork sandwich, but not something to eat while walking!  The only real criticism I have is that the roll gets a bit soggy by the time you get to the second half of the sandwich due to the creamed corn.  Nonetheless, the sandwich was great and still a value at $27 (compared to other strip offerings) .  The lobster was almost all cooked perfectly - a couple chewy pieces, but overall was great.  The website menu lists it as being made with jalapeno creamed corn, but I don't think that's the description on the menu we received in the restaurant.  (I didn't taste any jalapeno.)    My husband really enjoyed the Peanut Butter Crunch Burger.  He commented that he would have liked more potato chips on it, but that when he got a bite that had all of the components together, it was fantastic.  We didn't have enough room for dessert, but we'll surely be back again.  Our only wish is that there was a better bourbon and scotch list, but - to be fair - the name suggests that is not the focus.",

Our waitress was really not so good at her job with very frequent interruptions, dropping things, taking away things we needed, and not being around when she was needed. Please don't interrupt my conversation to tell me you'll be right back with something. Just bring it. Don't ask me if it's okay that my burger comes with fries if there is no alternative. Don't ask me if I need another beer while my current one is half-way full every 5 minutes.   The burger was pretty good and cooked medium-rare as ordered. It was cooked in a lot of butter though, making it too rich. When paying $19 for a burger and fries (?!!), could you please serve it to me on a plate instead of in a basket? The sauce and juices drip all over the fries, making them soggy. The fries were sub-par. I would expect thicker cut fries, skin on, or something other than what looked like and tasted like McD's fries. And $1.50 sharing fee? No thanks.   The beer menu is good with very high prices. It's not easy to find craft beer in Vegas, but this bar has a decent selection. I went back the next day for Happy Hour to get a deal on a pint, but sadly the Happy Hour specials are only on cocktails and tall boy cans of PBR. Really? You're a craft brew pub, but you feature the worst beer in cans as your special? No thanks. The Todd English P.U.B. at the Aria has equally good beer and half-price pints for Happy Hour (3-6).   If you are stuck at the MGM Grand and need a bite or a beer, there are worse options. I'm sure most of the food is delicious, but I couldn't afford to try it.",

Love Michael Mina restaurants, so we will definitely go back in hopes that the service issues get corrected.",

The crunchiness of the ridged potato crisps meld with the bacon jam to trick your buds into thinking you're monching into crisp bacon.  Was there for lunch when it was a bit more tamed down.  Decent enough atmosphere, and friendly staff.  I'd do it again.",

Our server Marissa was on point the whole time and didn't skip a beat with our needs. Food took a bit to get out but hey, I said they were packed. When it got out it was amazing. I had the pb crunch burger and my buddy the turkey burger. He said prob one of the better ones he has had. I mean its Michael Mina so you kinda expect a little high end feel to it and was definitely delivered.   Over great and ill be back next trip to Vegas. Hopefully Marissa hasn't moved on by then, very rare to get small city attention and service out there.",

    "text": "This restaurant was always packed with people since it opened, so I was excited when I got a chance to try out their food. I went with a couple of my friends on a weekend at night during peak hour, so I expected it to be pretty busy.   First off, I love love love the atmosphere. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant, and I loved how it mixed the old-traditional pub look with a more modern touch. I also found the little window in to the kitchen area very entertaining. It was a bit loud when we were there but that's because it was a Saturday night, so it was to be expected.  The food was great! They were HUGE portions, so I do suggest that you share your food if you typically can't finish things that you order. Most of their food are burgers and fries, but they do have different options like steaks, fish & chips, lobster rolls, etc. Also they have unique touches to their burgers/sandwiches like the peanut butter crunch burger. I got the bacon cheeseburger and it was absolutely amazing. The saltiness of the bacon was nicely balanced with the perfectly seasoned meat patty. It wasn't too salty or too seasoned. I also got the Mac & Cheese as side with my burger, and it was so creamy and delicious! Loved it! Before that we got the stuffed devil's eggs for appetizers. It was light and creamy, but I only wish they gave us more! The dessert was my F.A.V.O.R.I.T.E part. We ordered a chocolate cake and a lemon sponge cake, both were amazing! Each cake, or rather each dessert, came with a little mini milk shake that complimented whatever dessert you got, so the chocolate cake came with a chocolate shake and the lemon sponge cake came with like a light lemon-y shake. I thought that was absolutely cute and unique, and for the price I think it's worth it. (If you're a chocolate or heavy sweet addict like me, I recommend the chocolate cake!)   The prices weren't too bad, for a casual restaurant on the strip at a hotel. The price range is from $8 to $47($47 being the highest on the menu). Their burgers & entrees ranged from $15 to $32. The steaks are the most expensive: ranging from $32 to $47, but like I said the portion sizes are huge so you can share.   As for the service, it was PERFECT. My friend had a different experience, but I think she just overreacted to things. I mean it was pretty busy when we came, and we were very demanding. We asked for napkins, straws, ranch dressing, separate spoons for desserts, etc. We kept ordering things at different times, but the staff was amazing. They were friendly and got everything we asked for. They were very attentive to our needs.   The reason I rated this down a star is because I wished they would've asked me how I wanted my burger. I thought it'd come out rare like it usually does, but it came out medium-rare, so I wished they would've asked me before I ordered it. Also each of my friends had different types of fries, for instance I hand regular french fries, another one of us had potato wedges, another one had something totally different. I wished they would've asked us what kind of fries we wanted or at least indicted what type of fries our entrees came with on the menu. One last thing is that the fish & chips cost like $24, but you only get like 3 pieces of fish & a whole basket full of potatoes, so that was a bit disappointing, but other than that my whole experience was fantastic.   This is a great restaurant if you want to hang out with friends, relax, and grab a burger and chill! My recommendations would be to definitely try the desserts and get the Mac & Cheese as a side!",

We had lunch and ordered Nachos as appetizers.  Keeping with Michael's flare for food, the presentation was interesting as were the different flavors displayed on a baking sheet, not piled high with goopy cheese.  The menu, which, by the way is not on their website yet,  said the nachos came with green chili - at lunch, there were 3 small chunks of nicely flavored pork.  A couple of days later we stopped in for a late dinner/snack, ordered them again, and yes, there was green chili with ample pork on them.  The pork really adds to the whole taste of the dish.  The Chicken Drumstick appetizer is just that - large Drumsticks - crunchy, gooey, delicious - the  Lobster Corndogs are delicious too.  We didnt order the lobster roll because we had had it several times at Nob Hill,  our favorite Michael Mina restaurant that we were so sad to learn had closed in April.   This Pub is NOT Nob Hill by any stretch of the imagination, nor is it Todd English's Pub at City Center.",

    "text": "Another great addition to Las Vegas in the refined bar food scene. Michael Mina is probably known more for his fine dining but that is why I tried it out. The Menu is easy to navigate and fun but uses high end ingredients which is really nice to see in a pub setting. Four of us had a ton to eat and drink and enjoyed it all for the place only being open a couple of days.  Food: - Fried Pickles was a great starter and had some mustard inside that was amazing - Green Chile Stew was awesome - Double Dog Dare wrapped in bacon and topped with Guac and chicharrones was pretty dope and all 4 of us had two good bites each and enjoyed it (Great dish to share) - Ahi Poke was a super high grade Tuna but under seasoned  - Maitake Mushroom Tempura was really good but also under seasoned  - Fish and Chips was clearly high quality fish and that makes all the difference - We mentioned to the Chef about the seasoning and he was appreciative and thanked us for bringing it to his attention. I have no doubt this place will keep getting better each week they are open (Seems like that kind of crew)  Drinks: - There was a wide selection of beers and we drank them - They has home made Red Hot shots and we absolutely loved those - They also seemed to have a bunch of bourbons and rums that they age themselves in casks and were ridiculously smooth and we drank a bunch of this.  Any service issues were easy to understand as they have only been open a few days and the place is already slammed non stop. Such a good time,  All in all great place if you are staying in the MGM and by far the best place to go to watch a game or before and after shows at the MGM since it is in that food corridor. I look forward to going back",

    "text": "Seablue was one of my favorite spots to dine when coming into town so I was really sad to see it go; however, Pub 1842 is a welcome addition to the spot!!! Michael Mina does it again with his inspiring, fresh and unique menu! He never seems to disappoint. The restaurant decor is beautiful and the staff is spot on like usual. It is so nice to go to a restaurant in which the staff is well educated on the menu and knows what they are talking about. It is frustrating when you go to a restaurant and the wait staff is unable to answer basic questions about the menu. That is definitely not the case here. Our waiter was able to answer all the questions our group had and also give us some of his recommendations. He was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and spot on with his service.    The burgers are phenomenal! I grubbed on the 1842 burger which was packed with flavor and cooked to perfection! The patty was juicy and the mushrooms and truffle aioli puts it over the top- in a good way of course!  I mean who doesn't love truffle? YUM! Other winners were the homemade frickles and 1842 nachos. Living in Texas, I can be quite picky when it comes to fried pickles. Not many places know how to do them right. They have to be the perfect medium of crunchy yet juicy inside. 1842 has it down!!! The special sauce is unreal and gives it just the right blend of sweet and salty. The nachos came out hot and crispy. Often times when you order nachos the chips can get watered  down and soggy from the beans and salsa on top. One of my fav places for nachos on the strip is Margaritaville, but I have to say 1842 gives them a run for their money! They are not as large of a portion, but the twist they put on ordinary nachos is unforgettable and delicious!   The moscow mule is very tasty! Another pet peeve I have is when places put too much ginger beer in the moscow mules. This place knows how to mix it just right and they serve the drink how it should be served- copper mugs!!   I am excited this place has joined the MGM scene and will definitely be a returning customer when I am in Vegas. I can't wait to try more items each time.  PS this place is on the way to the pool so a perfect spot to stop off for Happy Hour after a day at the pool!   1842 is a winner! Michael Mina, you did it again! Bravo!",

The infamous peanut butter and bacon jelly burger is worth trying, but the peanut butter part gets a little intense and exhausting after a few bites. I loved the breakfast burrito and fried pickles--maybe opt for those and get your friend to order the burger.   All said, I walked away being truly impressed with the quality of the whole experience, from the fun drinking \"isms\" that greeted me on the chalkboard over the bar to the very earnest service from food runners and bussers alike, and all of the deliciousness in between.",

The nachos were really good the frickles were even better...the lobster corn dogs, blah skip it!  The drinks here imo were really small,  I mean it is vegas and drink size shouldn't be an issue but it is here.  Have drinks here and then come eat here.  There were about 5 of us and the bill came out to about 220?  so I guess the prices are a little higher at about 40 pp?  For that you can eat at a buffet or somewhere else.    if you are hungry and don't want to endure a long dinner the this is a place.  The service is a little slow so be prepared.  Cheers and happy eats!",

Somewhat randomly chosen but a nice find: sticks right out into the center of the MGM so you feel the open space.  The menu was a mix of comfort food and creative experiments: fun for the foodie and the grubby eater.  I was drawn to the most unusual combination of the burger with peanut butter, bacon jam, and potato chips, which proved to be less obnoxious than it sounds--the taste combo was fairly subtle and unified without too much of the extra ingredients and a nice crunchy, toasty, burnt taste that wasn't too overwhelming.   Great service (except forgetting one person's dish entirely---but then we got it fast and for free).",

I ordered the shrimp and grits and sadly there wasn't anything I can compliment about the dish. The shrimp were over-cooked and the grits were extremely thick and pasty. It came with brown gravy that tasted like it came out of a package and had been over-reducing all day. My fiance ordered the fish and chips which came out a bit better, large pieces of fish with a nice batter and fried to a golden brown. We both decided we wouldn't order the dishes again but maybe a burger would be a good choice there!",

    "text": "Great upscale sports bar that provides a large selection of beers on tap and some great barbecue food to pair all those beers with.   We had the nachos for an appetizers which came on a big baking sheet, I like the use of pots and pans to serve food. For entrees I went with the Pulled Pork, Brisket, and Spare Rib Platter with a side of Kale Slaw. The kale salad was good but my wife's not a fan of mayo in cole slaw. The spare ribs were a little tough, they didn't fall off the bone like I was expecting. The pulled pork was good but probably no different than Chipolte's Pulled Pork. The brisket was a little dry but the biscuit that came on the side was my favorite. My wife had the burger Medium Well which is a terrible way to eat a burger but that was really tasty and moist so they did well there.  My biggest beef would be that the bar seating is what they use for their dining guest. Correct me if I'm wrong but most table within the bar area are first come first serve and not part of the dining room. As you can imagine it's pretty noisy and you have people standing around next to you as you try and have a date with your significant other. All in all the prices I thought were high for what you get, but all of Vegas is over priced so I have to keep that in mind.",

We were welcomed pretty fast but server kept passing us and whispering something and it took a few times before he actually stopped to help us . The server kind of seemed a little off and not all there. Once we ordered it came pretty fast . The appetizers were just the beginning we ordered vegetables and hummus . The vegetables were so oily and had tons of a vinegar dressing on it and hummus had the same dressing smothered on top also ordered the scallop and shrimp ceviche it needed flavor so badly. My burger looked awesome only thing was the mushrooms were soaked in once again a vinegar strong flavor that I couldn't get past, my sister got the new special burger with tempura avocado and mango salsa she loved it and my friend got fish n chips . The fish was flavorful but both her sauces were ONCE AGAIN just too much vinegar only thing normal was the malt vinegar . I ordered a side of baked cauliflower and I love vegetables but it was way to sweet . Over all I give this place such a poor rating because they tried way to hard and sometimes simple is better . As a chef I know everything should be flavorful but they really pushed it to a level that made me want to just drink water for a hour straight no breaks . My friend left nauseous and got to the room and threw up. Glad to try a new place but I will not be going back.",

The macaroni and cheese was nothing short of disgusting.  There may have been 5 cheeses in the sauce, but the ratio of cheese to roux  was so small that it tasted like a buttery flour sauce.  And the \"crunchy onions\" were so close to canned French's onion rings that I might guess that is what they were.  If not, then they might consider frying their onions fresh because mine were cold on top of hot (barely) Macaroni and cheese.  The other diners we were with politely left half their food on the table.  Clearly, the beer is the star of the show.  It was cold, and it was good, but the top chef had nothing to do with that.  I did not expect to have fine dining cuisine here, but as far as pub food goes, it has a lot to live up to. I'm not sure if Michael Mina has tasted his food lately, but I wouldn't put my name on this food.",

So off to Michael Mina's I go.  Since I came by myself, I was directed to sit at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and chill.  I ordered the: - mushroom burger which was so darn good. Exactly what I was looking for - comforting and full of flavor. This is a must if you love mushrooms and onions.  - fried pickles were errrr... Okay I guess. This is my first time having it, but I still prefer regular pickles. You know how they say anything fried would taste better, well this is not the case.  - Moscow's Mule was delish! I had to negotiate with the bartender to only put 1/2 the amount of vodka jn there coz I'm a lightweight - he was hesitant in the beginning but I'm glad he listened to me because halfway through the drink, I was tipsy.

We ordered the nachos and pretzels to start. The pretzels were yummy but hard to share with 4 people (including one teen). The nachos honestly, were not my fave. i got the falafel burger with feta for dinner. Wow, perfectly crisp outside, tender inside and seasoned well. The topping is what really knocked it out of the park. The burger was so big, I could only eat half. Good stuff!",

    "text": "I stopped in here for a dinner with some girlfriends during a celebratory weekend in Vegas.  I had never heard of Michael Mina, but one of my friends was a big fan and picked out this place for our first night in town.  The place is located inside the MGM Grand.  We wandered around for a little bit, but finally found the place.  The place looked pretty packed, but we were quickly seated since we had a reservation.  We were in a big booth that seated 6.  I noticed that the hightop tables next to us had self-serve taps on the table, if beer happens to be your thing.  Beer is not quite my thing so I ordered a drink called Fog City.  It's a rum based punch that packs a pretty nice punch.  It's tasty too.  We started off with an order of pretzels and frickles.  The pretzels are bigger pretzel sticks served with a beer cheese sauce that has a poached egg in the middle.  Several of the girls picked around the egg, but I went all in and broke it so I could enjoy it.  I think it made the beer cheese sauce better.  The fickles is their version of fried pickles.  Instead of being pickle slices like chips, they are fried pickle spears.  They didn't really look that appetizing, but they were actually pretty good.  The special sauce that they serve on the side is what makes it so good.  Make sure you get extra of that stuff.  I ended up ordering the 1842 burger for my entree.  I subbed out a turkey patty for the beef patty.  The 1842 burger is topped with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and truffle aioli.  The toppings really made the turkey burger good.  The turkey patty was a bit on the dry side, but acceptable.  I'm sure it would have been even better with the beef patty.  The burger came with a side of fries.  They are your usual fries.  Overall, the food was pretty good and the company even better.  I will say that service was on the slow side.  Our server was pretty busy and it took a while to get water and beverage refills.  Paying was a bit of a pain because we had to break out the bill ourselves.  She said that she could do it for us, but that it would take her a really long time.  We had already been there for quite a bit so we went ahead and used our handy dandy TAB app on our phone to make splitting the check a breeze.",

    "text": "\"Was it a dream where you were standing in sort of sun-god robes on top of a pyramid, and there were hundreds of naked women screaming and throwing little pickles at you?\" -- Real Genius (1985)  I'm a big fan of Michael Mina - having eaten at his establishments in San Francisco and even when this location was called Knob Hill years ago - so when I found out there was another Michael Mina place to check out - I was all in.  I grabbed my girlfriends and quickly made a reservation for us and off we went.  I forgot how maze-like MGM Grand can be and they have made so many changes since I was here last time.  Plus, with the Nascar folks in town - it was a zoo. So we were a couple of minutes late for our reservation - but despite our tardiness and how packed they were - they seated us right away in a 6-top booth.  We were starving and immediately opted for cocktails and snacks - ordering the frickles (fried pickle spears) and the pretzels with a gooey beer-cheese dip with a fried (maybe poached) egg in the center.  The pretzels were amazing and I will say that the dip was better once someone broke the egg into and swirled it all around - I didn't even realize it was in there until someone else had the guts to break it and mix it all up.  The frickles were also delicious - with a snap to them and a sauce that was to die for - I could have put that stuff on everything!  My cocktail was the Soda Popinski.  Not being a fan of sweet cocktails - I tend to go for the tart ones or bourbon laced ones.  This was Grey Goose, Fresh Lime, and Ginger Beer - so perfectly tart and packed a real punch! Loved it!  For my entree - I was torn.  I finally gave in and ordered the Double Dog Dare.  This was two bacon-wrapped wagyu hot dogs, topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, and chicharones. So double the pork on top of fancy beef dogs - you cannot go wrong. But damn - this was a LOT of food.  I didn't want the fries it came with, so I asked for a substitute of the Mac and cheese.  I was warned it would cost extra - yeah, I'm in Vegas - I don't care.  So I opted for the smoked gouda mac and cheese with broccoli.  Not too shabby, but I've had better.  This is not a hot dog you can eat with your hands - you have to use a knife and fork.  Not that I minded - because it was DAMN good.  Honestly, I don't think it needed the guac and pico - just all that pork goodness and leave it be...maybe a fancy mustard and walk away. But I was happy - and seriously, could not eat it all (such a shame).  For \"dessert,\" they had boozy milkshakes.  How can you NOT get a salted caramel shake packed with bourbon?  Especially when they offer to put it in a to-go cup?  Exactly.  It was my birthday, after all.  Overall, the service was slow and we had to split up the check ourselves.  Our waitress said it would take her SO long to do it, so we took care of it on our own.  This is from the server who had trouble keeping our water glasses full (we might have ordered extra cocktails from her, but it was taking too long) and my mac and cheese came out late and I had to remind her about it - I still ended up with the fries.  So service loses them a star, but the food keeps them at 4 stars (plus honoring of the reservation despite us being late).  Thanks Mr. Mina - you know I will be back again.",

    "text": "Having time to kill before our concert over the weekend, a group of us decided to give Pub 1892 a shot. They offer a happy hour in the bar area every day, but unfortunately there were not seats in the bar area so we just decided to take a booth. They offer all the happy hour drink specials outside the bar, so we were still happy and the menu wasn't too expensive for the quick bite we were hoping for.  We settled in and decided to share an order of nachos and the lobster corndogs. We got some drinks as well and they were pretty good. The nachos came out quickly and they were enormous. We had every intention on ordering a few more items to share but after the nachos we were pretty full. The lobster corndogs came out and they were ok. My fella and mom didn't enjoy them at all so I ended up having to take the brunt of this dish. It was enjoyable, but pretty greasy. Definitely better to share  most of these dishes. Most of the entrees that came out for neighboring tables were pretty sad looking. Tiny portions and the food didn't look or sound very exciting. The highlights from the menu really seemed to be the appetizers which were on the more creative side as well as the burgers that were a good portion size for the price.   The pina colada was really the only good cocktail we tried and actually enjoyed, but with an extensive beer assortment, this is the preferable thing  to order here.  I was debating between three and four stars, but based on the food we ordered alone I will stick with three until I give this place another try. I won't go out of my way to try this place again, but it's a solid choice if you're in the area for a show or vacation.",

At first we wanted to sit at the bar but most of the seats were taken and the all of the two person high-top tables had \"reserved\" signs on them which I didn't understand.  We grabbed a beer and a cider (quite expensive at nearly $20) and asked for a sit-down table.  We ordered the 1842 (caramelized onions, mushrooms and truffle aioli) and the Bacon burger, both at $19.00 each.  I thought they were good.  I also ordered the \"hair of the dog\" which was a shot of Jim Beam and a shot of pickle juice.  We call this the \"pickle-back\" here in San Diego.  At only $8 this was possible one of the better values.  The interior is not terribly huge or decorated in a memorable way.  There's a little outside patio type of area with standing hooks for your jackets or hats which I thought was a nice touch.  Overall I wish there was more variety on the menu and wasn't blown-away like I am at some other Vegas restaurants (hence only 3 stars) but I would go back to Pub 1842 try some other things which may get it more stars (especially these lobster corn dogs I keep hearing about).  This is my first Michael Mina restaurant.",

I found Pub 1842 on the Thrillist list of best burgers in Vegas (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thrillist.com%2Feat%2Flas-vegas%2Fbest-burgers-in-vegas&s=64c7805fc29573b6319a750473e7e6911ad9997a290b0da0ee703bcdb9ccd74c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thrillist.com/eat/las-ve...</a>), and I strongly recommend it if you're looking for a delicious-yet-reasonable meal in the MGM Grand.  I thoroughly enjoyed the classic 1842 Burger, topped with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and truffle aioli, with BBQ seasoned fries that will remind you of BBQ Lay's Potato Chips!  Warning: the hot soft pretzels are highly addictive!! They come with a poached egg swimming in beer cheese (topped with chives) for dipping, which is the perfect savory flavor combo to go with the salted pretzel pieces.  Note, the burgers significantly outshine the BBQ ribs.  I will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "It was a little bittersweet knowing that SEABLUE had closed down and Michael Mina re-imagined the space into Pub 1842, a more casual gastropub.  The bright side is that because the food is more casual fare, it makes it more easy for everyone to come in for some upscale and creative bar food without spending too much.  The best part was that almost everything on the menu came with Michael Mina's famous Duck Fat Fries.  I didn't plan on having a big meal this visit, but instead for an afternoon snack.  And the perfect entree for that was the Double Dog Dare.  The Double Dog Dare. --  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1h4zPzJ&s=906b7db4368a87ac85685ca58be07a11c96d8f2671b9d3992bfd6d5289e36bf4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1h4zPzJ</a> Bacon-wrapped \"double barrel\" wagyu dogs, guacamole, pico de gallo, chicharones  This is definitely a knife and fork type of dog because there really isn't any way to eat this with your hands.  And although it may seem too much on paper, it all works together, especially with the guacamole, bacon, and crispy chicharones!!  And yes, it came with the Duck Fat Fries!  Okay, so it's a little too much for an afternoon snack, but it was so good!  I also thought it was really cool that they sat me at a table right across from the kitchen so I got to see firsthand how my Double Dog Dare was made (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1faB6nw&s=3ed87c87f781b7a2940889262007ffb14235860d5cab6176dae4a623b5f1d476\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1faB6nw</a>).  So despite me coming in just for a 'small' meal, my experience at Pub 1842 was pretty enjoyable.  They definitely did a complete 180 turn with the space compared to when it was SEABLUE, but it really is all for the better.  I really want to come back to try more of theie creative bar food, especially the Peanut Butter Crunch Burger!!",

    "text": "Just when I thought I was done with my hipster beer encounter, we got suckered into claiming the BOGO PBR check-in offer. I had my share of 2 beers but felt absolutely nothing. Our server was awesome. We had lots of questions and requests and he delivered. We tried the hot soft pretzels, 1842 burger, peanut butter crunch burger, a bit of everything BBQ plate and the baked ziti \"pie\".  Hot Soft Pretzels: Pretzels with 'Merican beer cheese and poached egg. We were iffy about the poached egg. One person in our group is not a big fan of eggs and I'm not a fan of egg yolks especially if it's runny. But at the same time, we want to know what it's like to have it the way it was meant to be served. Our server gave us two sauces: one with poached egg and one without. Brilliant! A friend had to mix the poached egg and 'Merican cheese together as I looked away. The egg made the sauce a bit thicker. The pretzels themselves weren't all that great or soft. 3/5  1842 Burger: Caramelized onions, mushrooms and truffle aioli with a side of fries. I asked for extra truffle aioli for my fries. Medium-rare perfection, natural sweetness from the onions and the flavor and fragrance of truffle aioli. The fries were thin and crispy and sprinkled with chopped parsley. They put pickle spears on top of the bun - no pickle juice touched my meat, yay! 4/5  Peanut Butter Crunch Burger: Bacon jam, crushed wavy potato chips and chunky peanut sauce, fries on the side...pimiento on the side per our request. This seemed so interesting so gave it a try. It wasn't exactly peanut butter they slathered on the bun but a peanut sauce with chunks of peanuts. I tried it with and without pimiento. With the pimiento, it was like eating a Thai burger - nutty and slightly spicy. It was good the first few bites but the texture and flavor overload wore me out that I couldn't finish it. 3.5/5  A Bit of Everything BBQ Plate: Ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Comes with kale slaw, jalapeno cornbread, baked squash and baked beans on the side. The meats were tender, sweet but vinegary. \"This is better than Rollin Smoke.\" 4/5   I was so full I didn't try the bake ziti \"pie\" so you'll have to wait for John F's review - if he ever writes one. They have football specials every Sunday, Monday, Thursday and Saturday for beers, shots and burgers. For dessert they have: shakes (with or without alcohol), big chocolate layer cake, warm cookies & shake and butterscotch custard. We had no room for that.",

    "text": "Four words: peanut butter crunch burger.  You can't go wrong with a massive burger with bacon jam, potato chips, and a peanut sauce that tastes like peanut butter but isn't quite that thick. It might sounds weird but it is a must try. Be warned though that it is very filling. I like to think I can eat my fair share but I wasn't able to finish this massive burger. If you aren't totally starving you could probably split this. It comes with fries that were just okay but nothing special. It is somewhat pricey but that's to be expected for a place in a Vegas casino.  I'll be back here next time I'm in the area and have a big appetite.",

I ordered the crab cake appetizer and the 8 oz. filet mignon. The crab cake was EXCELLENT and the only good highlight of this visit. However, the kitchen screwed up the cooking of the filet. I ordered medium and it came out rare. Of course, once they try to re-cook it to the proper temperature, it is never the same, and this was no exception. I usually don't take the risk of ordering a $40+ steak in a \"pub\" vs. a True steakhouse, but I didn't listen to myself this time. The bartender apologized, but it wasn't his fault. The kitchen gave me an extra order of fries, but I don't know what I was supposed to do with a combined pile of fries the size of my head.",

Sat at the bar, unsure what we were going to do.  Our bartender was very patient and helpful when ordering food and drinks.  He took time to explain a few things ahead of time so we could make educated choices.  For drinks, my husband had a beer and I had Hattori Hanzo, a Japanese whisky infused with vanilla.  it was strong but very nice to sip, not at all sweet.  First we split their California Greens that came with White Balsamic.  The dressing was the perfect blend of vinegar, citrus and sweet.  Then we split an 1842 burger, which had caramelized onions and mushrooms... one of the best ever!  I like simple burgers without all the fixings so as to showcase the meat.  The sweet of the onions and earthiness of the mushrooms... my mouth is watering thinking of it. Such a surprise but the best unplanned meal on our 5 day trip!  I would love to have one of these pubs nearby!!",

( THIS IS A GREAT THING IT MUST MEAN THE RESTAURANT IS DOING THINGS RIGHT) So to start off I have to say I'm glad they kept the open kitchen from the old restaurant SEABLUE. The decor of the restaurant was hands down stunning and all the funny quotes on the walls were great. The vibe of the restaurant was running smooth I saw staff laughing and having a great time, managers running around and helping with serving food and cleaning tables. ( You don't see that at many places great job to the team ) Well the music was not as loud as I thought it was going to be, I could still hear all the people cheering for their Hockey teams on the TV. This was fun and great. With that being said the bartender gave us menus and a drink list. This place had some cocktails that I can't wait to go back and try. I stuck to the beer, if you are headed to this place start off with the Shinner very light it was a great beer to start with after a hot day out by the pool crisp, light and had me wanting to drink more. Second I had the Abby this was a little more on the darker side but not to heavy it had hints of maple, caramel and very toasty another great choice. My girlfriend had one of the punches \"nacho libre\" great name right. It was a tequila based cocktail with port and topped with a sprig of cilantro. It tasted as great as it smelled. For food we had the crab cake. The crab cake was not fishy like most of them in this world are but very fresh crab meat that stood out, the crust of the crab cake was very like and not greasy very tasty and I would say its a must order. We had to try the frickles ( yes fried pickles ) I've had these one time only in DC and they sliced very thin. Well at Pub 1842 they serve the whole pickle sliced in quarters and then fried. Wow hands down Amazing. We also order the fish n chips. They use cod for the fish n chips and they were cooked to perfection golden in color and very tasty. The house maid tarter sauce was great and the hand cut fries let's just say WOW. I can't wait to go back and try more food, great cocktails and great beers. The PUB 1842 is here and not going any where. Great job guys!!!!",

No - we'll be with you shorlty - no nothing. i thought about leaving because of how rude the 2 girls were being. i'm standing there looking at them with my girlfriend. there's no way they did not see me. i'm feeling very uncomfortable and unwelcome. they finally talk to me and tell me 10min wait. that's not bad so i say ok. i mean, for 10 min wait, they make me wait at least 2-3 min just standing there to tell me that. i'm pretty pissed and don't understand. it does not take much to say - hi, be with you in a second.   the girl who waited on us at our table was great however. we ordered the burger and split it. $1.50 to split it which is annoying but minor compared to NYC prices to split something. we split it because we thought it would be huge. it's a $20 burger but it was not really that big. we could have got an entire burger each but the fries had some sort of BBQ flavoring on them which neither of us liked. overall the food was pretty good. the service was good. the hostesses get -1 star. i wish i could get their names and get them fired. i've never felt more unwelcome at a restaurant in my life.i only ate there because it was next to the venue for phish and it was late and i did not want food court food. but i ended up getting food court food the next night for dinner and got much better, welcoming service, which is ridiculous.

I ordered the ahi tuna and brussel sprouts. I also had one of their cocktails I can't remember the name but it had vodka and ginger beer in it.  The Ahi tuna was too creamy and wasn't what I expected.  The brussel sprouts were too greasy.  They had large chunks of bacon in them which would have been good if it wasn't so greasy.  My drink while good was so small!  For $13 I would have expected double the size. My husband had the ribs and fries which he said was ok and my brother had the fish and chips which he liked but for almost $30 a plate they said it wasn't necessarily worth it.  Would I go back?  Yes,  it's convenient to make open table reservations and it's a good location.  However,  I won't be getting what I ordered,  nor will I order one of their specialty cocktails.",

In the meantime I order a skirt steak, shrimp cocktail with friends and they had the peanut butter burgers.  The waitress came back with news that the managers had found some root beer for me and brought it over.  They had gotten me a full pitcher from somewhere else to have with my meal which was pretty sweet.  Sara was very nice (and cute) and made sure we were well taken care of.  Sara was sweet and had the humor to \"threaten\" to drink the rest of the root beer if I didn't finish the pitcher.

    "text": "Wow, Impressive! in a town with several high profile celebrity chef run pubs this one stands head and shoulders above the competition (gordon ramsay, todd english et al) and chef Michael Mina was actually running the kitchen and checking every plate when we came in for lunch tuesday! The greeting at the door was friendly and the decor is warm and inviting while remaining open and airy. The energy in the room is great and there is something for everyone, corner tables tucked away, booths, these crazy tap tables where you pour your own beers and a huge bar that dominates the room and is the center of the energy. The beer selection is outstanding and eschews the usual suspects and lame big box brews in favor of craft beers. There are some really awesome options. the cocktails are cool and there were some barrels on the bar that they use to age various concoctions. As for the menu its predictable in its offerings but you quickly learn that the strength is in making the usual unusually great with innovative twists and some outstanding products. you can see the kitchen from the dining room and a huge wood fired grill dominates. Who cooks burgers on a wood fired grill? someone who really cares about making tasty food thats who! the burgers are awesome and we tried a crunch burger which is a house ground patty grilled on wood with a sweet and tangy bacon jam, crunchy peanut butter, melted pimento cheese spread and potato chips, I didnt think it would work but it ended up being a highlight. We also had a lobster roll which was 27$ not cheap but a great value compared to other on the strip. It was served on a warm oversized toasted roll that was sweet, buttery and crunchy with loads of lobster meat mixed with sweet creamed corn and jalapeno, the best part? Crispy popcorn as a garnish and big crunchy steak fries tossed with garlic and herbs, this is a serious sandwich. We also ordered the chicken drumsticks which were buffalo style like wings but juicer, crisper and more of a value, the sause was a lime chipotle glaze with a house made blue cheese dressing that was outstanding. The service team was friendly and knowledgeable and when grilled on the menu were quick to answer or inquire about anything they didnt know. I cant wait for next years trip to see where they go with this! Its already off to a great start",

    "text": "A solid three stars maybe even four.  The three stars is because it's so overpriced but you are in Vegas.  Just saying.... $20 for a basic cheese burger is kinda silly to me.  Plus they charged an extra $1.50 just because my wife and daughter split one.  The burgers were really good though.  Cooked to order, large, with seasoned fries and all quite tasty.  Wife and daughter also ordered the drumsticks (which were like buffalo wings but actually just small drumsticks) and they liked them a lot.  The service was friendly, the atmosphere was nice but I wouldn't need to come back as it's just too expensive for what you're getting (but that's Vegas).",

My Asian salad with smoked grilled shrimp and cabbage was large and the dressing was spicy with citrus notes.  Couldn't finish it all.  Good beer selection and prices are in line with Las Vegas strip restaurants, but portion sizes and flavor were better than expected.",

The baked beans aren't your typical tastes-like-out-of-the-can fare,  well-seasoned,  hearty, meaty, these beans could be a meal on their own.  The jalapeno cornbread is delightfully sweet and mildly hot to contrast the savory flavors.  The bbq-spiced fries, I forgot to ask for them without salt, to my surprise when they say spiced that's what they mean.  There's a slight hint of salt but nothing overwhelming.  Altogether a wonderful meal and way to end my stay at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.",

I love peanut butter burgers (always drawn to them when I see them on the menu); if you haven't tried one before, don't hate - just try.  And the fries - oh the fries.  I had to literally throw trash on top of them to stop me from continuing to eat the plethora of fries that came alongside the burger (I hated myself for stopping myself at the time, but my tummy thanked me later :)).  They have a great deal during lunch hours - for something like $15 you can get a burger, choice of side salad or fries, a miller lite, and a cookie.    Will definitely stop back in for a casual, laid-back lunch.",

This was an excellent place to dine, drink and watch sports.  The atmosphere was casual and fun, the waitstaff were extremely prompt and my glass was never empty.  There was music playing and there were many TVs on all sides of the bar. It was spacious enough to hold a lot of people and not be overcrowded.  We sat in a booth near the bar, which was pretty comfortable.  We tried the soft pretzel appetizer, it came with some cheese for dipping.  It was warm and soft, very tasty.  My friend ordered the wedge salad with skirt steak on it.  The lettuce wedge was HUGE!!  I ordered the skirt steak with a side of French fries.  I have to say, I wasn't quite sure what to expect (I mean, it's skirt steak), but when it arrived I was *very* pleasantly surprised.  I ordered it medium well, which almost always gets screwed up at restaurants.  It was cooked exact to my liking and it was so juicy and tender, I was truly impressed!  The fries were pretty good too, but I only had a few, as the portion of the skirt steak was pretty generous.  The beer menu was very extensive, I had a hard time deciding on what to get.  They had a nice selection on tap, including some good IPAs (even the Sierra Nevada Red, which was pretty tasty).  The bill for two of us was around $65 for appetizers, two drinks and food.  I would recommend this place for something different than your typical bar food, but with a sports bar atmosphere.",

    "text": "***This is only for the cocktails.***  The wife and I were walking through the MGM on a Monday afternoon in search of a good cocktail.  We decided to check out Pub 1842, the newish Michael Mina joint in the space formerly occupied by his Seablue.  We'd always been impressed with the level of service and quality of drinks (and food, too) at other Michael Mina places we'd been to around the country and Pub 1842 was no exception.  Upon looking over the mid-sized cocktail list, I had high hopes when I saw that they offered an extensive lineup of barrel-aged cocktails ($13).  I enjoy the subtle, yet very pleasant effects aging in charred oak barrels has on cocktails.  I was immediately sold on their barrel-aged Vieux Carre.  The hard edges of this boozy classic were rounded off without losing any of the distinct notes of the disparate spirits comprising the drink.  It was nicely done and as good a rendition of a Vieux Carre that I've ever had.  For my second round, I had the barrel-aged Negroni.  It, too, possessed the familiar bitter notes that make a Negroni delicious, yet the barrel aging once again smoothed out the drink, improving on the classic.  Topping off our experience was the service we received from Alli, our bartender.  We could tell she enjoyed her job and was passionate about her craft.  She was friendly, knowledgeable in explaining Pub 1842's cocktail program, and attentive as she took great care of us.  She, just as much as the high quality drinks she served, made a lasting positive impression.  We'll be back and next time we'll try the food.",

Manager comes out and says they are unable because it was a set floor plan and that tv was just on the wrong program. Clearly you can change the channel I've worked in the restaurant business for 5 years never had a \"tv floor plan\" so precious that you don't listen to a customer request. Service was obviously questionable and food was more about speed then quality especially for the price. No wonder you had four total tables seated keep it up guys!",

    "text": "Love, love, love Michael Mina.  Pub 1842 didn't disappoint.  We started with the happy hour punch and the 1842 nachos, hot soft pretzels and lobster fritters.  The nachos are huge and delicious.  The whole table loved them.  The pretzels and fritters were good but didn't compare to the nachos.  We couldn't finish them between the 4 of us.  For our mains I got shrimp and grits.  The rest of table had shrimp and scallop ceviche and 2 orders of pub steak frites.  We also had a side of mac and cheese and the shake tasting.  We were all pretty full from the apps but managed to do some damage.  Everyone enjoyed their selection.  The shake tasting was the weak point of the meal.  The shakes were melty and not strongly flavored.  We had a hard time figuring out what each flavor was.  The color of the shake ended up being the deciding factor.  Service was ok.  She wasn't around much but did warn us when happy hour was about to end and got us another round.  That is a big plus in my book.",

Its a pub with TV's going so nothing too special about the atmosphere.  I did get the Peanut Butter Crunch Burger. Seriously, one of the weirdest things I have tried. My mouth was so confused when I first bit into it. The sweet from the peanut butter, the crunch and salt from the potato chips, then there's the bacon jam. Plus that really good angus beef patty. Its a hefty burger for sure. So it took a few bites before I decided how I felt about it. But then I realized that I love that burger. It was so good. I wished I could have eaten another.   My girlfriend had the spicy chicken sandwich. She enjoyed it. Its a buffalo sauce sandwich. She really enjoyed it.   Their sandwiches and burgers come with BBQ fries. They are regular fries seasoned with a BBQ seasoning and they are delicious.   I really enjoyed eating here. That darn Peanut Butter Crunch Burger is so weird but so great.",

    "text": "This is Michael Mina at his casual best!  An American pub;  Skeptical poker buds and I walk in ready to be insulted but were pleasantly surprised.  Straight to it, the food.  Remember, Mina is a master of seafood; namely lobster so...  There back!  Lobster corn dogs.  Incredibly sweet chunks of perfectly cooked lobster in a crispy, fluffy, semi sweet corn dog coating with a tangy whole grain mustard and creme fraiche.  Simply put, good eats.  Other starters such as the duck spring rolls with ginger chili dipping sauce, mint and cilantro (excellent with the earthy flavor of moist duck accented by a decent \"Asian\" dipping sauce that brings forth the flavor of the oily duck meat and a great, light, crisp tempura or maitake mushrooms in a soy, scallion dipping sauce are excellent.  As with all Mina's restaurants, try what sounds different.  While not authentic Asian, still very good flavors.  For larger plates, the Lobster roll with jalapeno creamed corn is excellent.  It's not Northeast authentic but who cares.  Rich, perfectly cooked lobster in a crisp, buttery roll surrounded by a very spicy creamed corn.  The flavor of the jalapeno brings a rich chili taste that contrast well with the sweet, cold water lobster.  The Korean BBQ salmon burger is also good eats.  Soy marinated, cooked medium, and accompanied by cucumber kimchi and ginger aioli is incredibly well balanced.  Complex texture.  Simply delicious.  Great pub style service.  Friendly and correct.  Nice selection of craft cocktails and infusions.  Solid but not too creative beer list.  OK wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.  A worthy replacement for Seablue.",

It will be weird, and you will have to get about 25-35% of the way through before you figure out if you like it or not, but believe me...you will love it. I've literally came to this place three times to JUST eat that burger and it beats any and all places (Nations in SF Bay, In & Out, Shake Shack, etc.).   It's weird. But it's effing delicious. Unless you're allergic to something, don't even bother ordering anything else.  *TIP* Get some Sriracha sauce (no, Im not a big fan of it usually). Just put a tiny tab before each bite and with the fries. You're welcome and Im forever sorry for ruining any and every burger before and after this.",

    "text": "I'm a big Michael Mina fan but wasn't really sure what to expect out of his new restaurant especially as (mediocre) gastropubs seem to be the trend du jour of celebrity chefs these days. That said, I was impressed by the food and all the dishes we tried were an easy 4*, possibly even 4.5* - but I am docking 1* for bad service.  Every single dish we had was good, although everything was definitely on the rich side. We started with the duck spring rolls and lobster corn dogs. Both were really balanced flavor-wise (especially the spring rolls, where the preparation tempered the usual oiliness of the duck), and both had fantastic texture contrast. For mains, we shared the baked ziti, double dog dare, heritage turkey burger, and the jumbo lump crab appetizer. Normally I would never ever consider a turkey burger, but a member of our party had heard the turkey burger here was one of the best and really wanted to try it. Well, the turkey wound up being incredibly moist and well-seasoned. I still don't think anything turkey can ever beat a great hamburger patty, but I was quite impressed. I was also a big fan of the baked ziti, which had just the right of amount of spiciness for that extra kick.  Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. The hostess could not have looked any more unhappy to be at work or to be having to deal with us. Our server was a little more friendly (not that that's saying much) but still lacked the polish and efficiency that we would have liked; refills on drinks were slow, had to ask multiple times to get requests fulfilled, jumbo lump crab came out with the appetizers even though we asked for it as a main dish, etc. Also, one of our party members is allergic to avocado so we told our server that and requested the guacamole in the heritage turkey burger on the side, but our server neglected to tell us that the pico de gallo on the double dog dare also contained avocado. We certainly take responsibility for our own food allergies, but good service would have involved her being aware of that potential problem.  Ultimately, come here for the food. Temper your expectations of service and this is a solid choice for casual but good eats.",

    "text": "**************************** REVIEW 873 ********************************           This much highly anticipated PUB 1842 by Michael Mina Group, recently opened at the MGM, the former spot of Sea Blue (also Michael Mina Group). Since I'm a big fan of Michael Mina restos, I was in town for work, yes during the crazy freaking EDC nightmare! I thought I dropped in for a quick visit, we ended up had a full dinner here.             PUB 1842 is an American pub featuring a wide selection of global beers, unique whiskey and hand-crafted coctailks by no other than the Barman/Mixologist Carlo splendorini from Michael Mina and RN74 in San Francisco. Pub 1842 offers 40 selections of beer, including ales, pilsners, stouts and lagers. TVs through out the bar,  I can only imagine Football seasons, it's going to be banana here!             Pub 1842 also offers  playful menu including a peanut butter crunch burger with bacon jam, potato chips and pimento cheese, the 1842 burger with caramelized onions, mushrooms, blue cheese and truffle aioli. Menu is very reasonable in price, all snacks $8-$15, appertizers $9-18, burgers $15-$19, entrees $18-32.          What we ordered on our visit JUNE 2013:  - Homemade Frickles - crunchy fried pickles $8 - lovely, perfect snack  - Crab Louie Deviled Eggs - Maryland blue crab, dill $9 - seriously perfect bite  - Lobster Corn dogs, whole-grain mustard creme fraiche $14, Michael Mina's signature dish that you can find at Arcadia Steakhouse in San Jose, and a few Bourbon steakhouses through out the country.  - Ahi Tuna Poke, avocado, shrimp crackers, butter lettuce - also similar to Michael Mina's signature dish at his flagship restos Michael Mina at the Bellagio and San Francisco, but for less!   - jumbo lump Crab Cake, shaved apples, green goddess, white balsamic $19 we all enjoyed this dish.  - 1842 Burger - caramelized onions, mushrooms,  blue cheese, truffle aioli - All American Wagyu beef, $18 - this burger was so juicy, tasty and the bun was perfectly shiny toasted. A MUST ORDER if you are a burger freak!  - A delish wild salmon entree $29, with corn, tomato and a lot of love by chef Michael Mina himself. It was DELICIOUS!   CAKE & SHAKES for $9 each only, all 3, my bestie and her boyfriend die happy :-)   - Lemon Curd Chiffon Cake & orange vanilla frappe - blackberry jam  - Shredded Coconut Cake & pina colada milkshake - white chocolate frosting  - Big Chocolate Layer Cake & chocolate malted milkshake - boiled chocolate icing            The service was perfect, quick, efficient, and pleasant. This was day 4th since they opened and I heard they did over 1,000 serving, that's AMAZING.            Chef Michael Mina was there at the counter going through tickets of orders at 6 PM on a THUR night, and the place was jammed packed. Thank you PUB 1842 and chef Michael Mina for another amazing meals and took so good care of us. Until a few weeks from now, we will pay another visit.            If you love beer, pub, burger, snack and a sport fan, PUB 1842 is a hot spot now in Las Vegas at the MGM. You can thank me later!",

Service was slow, despite coming after the lunch rush around 1pm. Waiter was friendly, but slow about checking up on our table.  Ordered the crab cake, which was sad and dry and fairly tasteless. Boyfriend ordered the buffalo drumsticks, which smelled odd and didn't taste great either. They were breaded heavily and were dry!  Overall, it just was not a good experience. It was also quite expensive to eat here even though the food was mediocre.   I highly advise you eat elsewhere!",

The interior looks cool and old school like it was actually the year 1842. Vegas is for gamblng, not for the great food. So full i couldn't even finish the side dish because i loved the burger!

    "text": "This is a much welcome addition to the MGM Grand! I was lucky enough to attend one of the mock service nights on Friday night.   If you ever dined at Seablue, you will recognize the set up, because it's pretty much the same. Just the decor has changed,  basically.  In general,  the Pub is very inviting.  There are large booths on one side of the bar, then tall tables on the other side. Then there is regular table seating and an elevated area that appeared to have taps at the tables.  The menu is definitely upscale pub grub, and prices reflect that. However, there are many creative items, in addition to classics to choose from.   We started out with 3 appetizers: house made frickles (fried pickles), lump crab deviled eggs and lobster corn dogs. 1st off, the pickles were amazing.  The spears were thick and retained their crunch. They were probably my favorite app. The lobster corn dogs were also delicious,  but they were a little greasy and fell off the stick. The crab deviled eggs were not my favorite,  but I can't really put my finger on why.  For entrees we had the baked ziti and the peanut butter crunch burger. The presentation of the ziti needs some work - it came out in a metal tin, which was placed on a dinner plate. Except the plate wasn't big enough for the tin and it wobbled while you ate. My suggestion is to place the tin on a cutting board to serve it. But the ziti was REALLY good,  so there is nothing bad to say about it otherwise.    The burger was really the highlight of the meal. It was cooked perfectly,  was super juicy and served with fries. It was topped with peanut butter and potato chips,  and my mouth was in heaven! It was the perfect combo of savory,  salty and sweet.  We didn't have dessert,  but did look at the menu. They have \"cakes and shakes,\" which was a cool concept.   They have great cocktails - my 1st was a bourbon drink, made with Bulleit and a strawberry pepper juice. So yummy.  Their beer list is pretty decent,  and they offer \"beer wheels,\" which are basically 8 tasters.   I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items! Of course the service was great, even though they are still working out some of the new restaurant kinks. They officially open 6/18, make sure you go check it out!",

    "text": "Michael Mina's Pub 1842 is in the heart of MGM Grand district -- a long hallway with an odd combination of high end restaurants, shops, and a food court. It took over for Sea Blue, also owned by Mina. The place was loud. Like night club loud. And, it attracts the pool/day club crowd so you'll see plenty of drunk dudes in tank tops.  The menu is full of stuff you'll be familiar with. But there's a twist with most, if not all, dishes. An ingredient or two that has been added to those comfort dishes to make them new and exciting. Like peanut butter on a burger or popcorn on a lobster roll. I couldn't pass up the peanut butter crunch burger ($14). The combo was so odd that I had to try it. And, you know what? It works. The peanut butter lightly coats the underside of the top bun. There isn't a lot of it, but there's no mistaking the taste when you take a bite. In combination with the crunchy, salty chips and a perfectly well seasoned beef patty with a crispy char coating, it makes for a great array of flavors and textures that are unexpected yet pleasing. It may not be the best burger I've had, but it was certainly memorable.  The other food was decent, but a step down from the burger. The jumbo lump crab cake ($19) was tasty, especially with the garlic basil dressing. The avocado kale caesar ($14) was an unnecessarily large portion that tasted good after the first few bites but was so rich that we left the rest of it untouched. They took what should have been a healthy and light dish and fattened it up needlessly. We ordered a side of chicken ($14) that my kid had for his dinner.   The one side dish we got was the mac and cheese ($9). It was as creamy, smokey, and cheesy as we had hoped but what ruined it for us was the broccoli. I'm not a fan of broccoli in mac and cheese and if they had bothered to list that ingredient on the menu I probably would not have ordered it.   We didn't stick around for dessert, although those options all sounded delicious. Service was spotty, as can be expected from a newly opened restaurant.  They've got a few tables with their own beer taps. Customers can swipe their credit card and pour their own beer. Might be some of the best tables around for drinking and people watching.  The menu has plenty of attractive sounding dishes and I'm sure I'll be back eventually, but I know which dishes i won't be ordering again.",

    "text": "We heard good things about this place so we wanted to check it out.  We were already fans of Michael Mina and were intrigued to see what he had cooking at this new location.  We had our two kids with us, but one day we'll have to come back for their Value Town - Happy Hour menu.  We were sat immediately by the Hostess and our waiter came by for our drink order and was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I started with my \"what's the best thing on the menu\" and he pointed us in the below direction. We started with the Crab Louie Deviled Eggs and the Lobster Corn Dogs.  Both were very good, but slightly heavy apps.  The Lobster Corn Dogs are a MUST try and pairing this with an IPA crushes your taste buds into happiness submission! Looking for a good entree, i was pointed in the direction of the \"Peanut Butter Crunch Burger\".  My wife ordered the 1842 Burger w/ caramelized onions, mushrooms and truffle aioli.  Her burger was good, mine was better. The bacon jam and crunchy potato chips make the PBCB extremely salty, so if you have an aversion, stay away.  Otherwise, order one up Mid-Rare, grab a beer, and enjoy the Flavor Train! The icing on the cake (knowing the value of a satisfied child) of the meal was the accommodating Chef. My three year old wanted Shrimp.  So the chef made a nice Pasta and Shrimp dish on the fly.  My kid wolfed it down like he was a starving child on a Sally Struthers infomercial and placed another full order.  Overall, service was extraordinary, price wasn't too bad, food was great.  Exactly what i expect Chef Mina to produce.",

    "text": "So this is the almighty Micheal Mina, the chef I have heard so much about since the new Levi's Stadium has opened?   SO why is it his 20 dollar cheeseburger - yes, even though it is Vegas, who has the balls to charge 20 bucks for a cheeseburger - isn't half as good as my local bar's 9 dollar one? Not in any category.   The meat was tasteless and dry, even though they did cook it medium rare. And bacon jam was so awful and overpowering you could still taste it after scraping it off.   This just confirms my theory - famous chefs do not have anything to do with these Vegas restaurants, at best they help design the menu, slap their name on it and cash checks until it closes.",

They happily obliged.  I ordered an Old Fashioned, and it was easily the best I've ver had.  Loved it! We spilt an order of the half nachos.  They were so covered in goop and toppings that we ran out of chips.  When does that happen?  Next time, more chips.  The flavor of the nachos were okay, the sauce was good but there were so many different peppers on it, green, red, red chilis, and so on that it was odd it didn't have more flavor.  They were good but not great.  The drinks were on point, the booths comfy, and the service very nice. I would like to come back here for dinner sometime as the menu seemed to offer some nice pub options.  Great spot!",

To find the pub we relied on our friends to text us where it was located in reference to some other places we were familiar with, other wise it may have taken us a little longer. It was in the walkway heading back to the MGM garden arena. Service was decent for our drinks and appetizers. We sat at the bar vs. waiting for a table, it was pretty crowded. Our food came out in a timely manner and we dove in. We had the 1842 nachos and the Hot soft pretzels. Pretzel itself was good but the beer cheese with bacon and poached egg was lack luster. The egg was not noticeable in flavor and I don't think there was any bacon in there at all. The nachos were your basic greasy mess all piled on top of each other, nothing to write home about.  While it was nice to meet up for drinks I do not find myself wanting to go back here, not for mediocre bar food.",

    "text": "Ordered the wedge salad and BBQ chicken wings (app as my main meal). I ordered the salad with ranch and it was probably one of the best wedge salads I've ever had. I'm extremely picky when it comes to salads in general - COLD and CRISP - always necessary for me- and this was was- FRESH as can be- perfecto!! Ranch- not to heavy and not too watery- just right and very flavorful! Nice! Perfectly slivered red onions and these amazing picked onions that gave this salad so much additional flavor- I mean a wedge salad is somewhat boring- but not here! And the marinated tomatoes on it- just another flavorful add on to this greatness! Ya gotta try it - so Delish for an otherwise typically unoriginal salad!!  I ordered the BBQ wings as my main dish. I cannot put into words how amazing these are! And these aren't your tiny no meat drummies- these are large with meat on the bone. They were cooked to crisp perfection with the tenderness of the meat- and glazed with a honey BBQ concoction that I have never tasted before...amazeballs!! Yup amazeballs! These wings were perfect in every way possible.  My hubs got the bacon burger and enjoyed it immensely- but - again - I was too busy enjoying this perfection of food I had ordered to pay much attention. Pack your patience to eat here- our order did take awhile- but it was well worth it!!! I have never taken left overs with me in Vegas, but I'd be damned if I was leaving these chicken wings behind. See you next time! We will be back!",

    "text": "Pretty cool pub inside the MGM... it's located in the Restaurant Row on your way to the Garden Arena.  They are serving up tasty goodies like homemade fried pickles, pork nachos and homemade pretzels.... this is just a short list... of the appetizers.  These were all the things I saw and wanted to try.  The Nachos were HUGE and looked \"oh-so-yummy\".  The table next to us was digging into these... and seemed to be enjoying them immensely.  But I was \"being good\".... sort of.  I restrained from filling up on these appetizers. We opted to share the ceviche... and then I shared a burger and salad with my mom.  Ceviche was good... not the best I ever had but definitely solid!  Lots of shrimps and scallops so PLUS there. I'm just picky... so keep that into account.      We had the 1842 burger (medium) and the chopped Chinese salad.  The Burger was SUCCULENT... JUICY.... MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH.... Yumminess!  Might be my new favorite burger.  I'm a big Bachi Burger fan... and this is right there...lots of flavor, savoriness and excellently prepared.  And then there's the Bun... Yes, the Bun is newsworthy... it was light and airy and soft.  It wasn't hard or dense.  I think it's definitely homemade cuz it just melted in your mouth along with the burger.  (Note... I was totally unimpressed with the store pickles they served with the burger.... it was limp and soggy.  I was expecting something more hand-crafted-like.)  The fries were ok.... nothing to get excited about.  But the Burger... The Burger is the Star!  The Salad was quite large!  Definitely Entree sized.  Even for the 2 of us we didn't finish all of it.  The dressing was Fabulous... light, not overpowering and just a hint of ginger.  I'd definitely order it again.  I mean... if I was \"being good\".  But I'd probably end up having the burger.  LOL!  The Atmo .... Dark like a pub... but not murky... lots of TVs everywhere.  It being March... there was Round-Ball on the tubes everywhere so we got a good variety of games to watch all at once.  It seemed like everywhere had a pretty good view of at least 2 TVs.  The Service.... The waitstaff / server / water guy... All On Point!  They were on top of it.    I definitely recommend making reservations if you plan on getting there after 5pm on a weekend.  We were there on a Saturday night at 5:15pm and we had about a 25 minute wait.",

    "text": "My fiance and I stopped in here for a late lunch one day while in Las Vegas.  We sat at the bar hoping to take advantage of some happy hour specials, but unfortunately there wasn't really anything that appealed to us on the happy hour menu.  Drink wise, there really wasn't much that appealed to me.  I like my craft cocktails and they really seem to focus on beer and mules here.  I saw pictures of lots of fabulous looking cocktails, but unfortunately none were on the menu when I was here.  I asked the bartender about them and he said they regularly update their cocktail menu, which makes sense, though I must admit I was hoping he would offer to make of the old ones.  Usually, they still can.   I had the grilled cheese on rye and tomato soup.  This was listed as a snack/small bite, but I thought the portion was pretty good.  I didn't finish the whole thing.  I'm not usually a big fan of rye bread, but it worked beautifully with the cheeses they used and the tomato soup which was excellent.  I would absolutely order this again.   My fiance had the brisket which was good.  I'm very particular when it comes to brisket, so I thought it was okay, but he really enjoyed it.   The atmosphere is that of a casual pub, which we needed after some pretty swanky meals around town.  However, it was a pub with very high quality food.  It is worth checking out for sure.",

I was seated immediately, but unfortunately my server took at least 10 minutes before my drink order was taken, and 20 minutes before my food was out.  I went with the house special \"the bacon burger\" along with their seasoned french fries and the Campfire Smores for dessert.   Service issues aside, the burger was well made and huge. Great bun, and the Gouda cheese, bacon jam, and secret sauce melted the burger in my mourh. The bacon was superb: perfectly cooked and crisped just right. Huge side of hot fries with a nice seasoned taste. Liked the smores dessert.   Had I had quicker service, this may have been a 5-star meal, but alas, it was (most definetly) 4 stars.",

That was probably due to the fact that the nachos were ginormous!  I forgot to mention that. Definitely get the nachos!  It's huge and could feed a family of 5, and it was sooooo good!  Layers upon layers and layers of toppings.  The picture explains it all.  We also got the bbq platter which we could hardly break into cause of the massive nachos and burger.  Oh this was all shared between three people.   The waitstaff was really friendly and was very attentive.  Probably a bit too attentive.  Maybe coming to check on is every 5 mins... Not sure if I like that.  Oh and the Bloody Mary isn't too bad either.  And their menu had the rules on how to play kings",

But 1842 is where we came back to on our last day because their Bloody Mary is SO amazing. So spicy and rich and succulent. I could drink that for every meal for the rest of my life. I also had the Bacon Burger, which was really good, but I ordered it without the special sauce (Thousand island dressing, which I can't stand) and I wish I had ordered it without the onion jam as well, just because I don't like sweet on my burger (that's just personal taste though, no knock against the restaurant). Fries were delicious. I also had the pretzels and beer cheese on a different visit, and they were orgasmic. A poached egg in the middle of a dip seems weird, but it is MAGICAL. I would suggest ordering the pretzels without salt though, the dip and the pretzels themselves are salty enough, and the big pieces of salt just get in the way.   Anyway, A++++ service, super friendly staff, food came out fast, check came fast. This was our favorite restaurant on our trip!",

To add a chicken breast is really $9??  The portions they give you are fairly generous though so I recommend splitting things unless you want to walk away with a ton of leftovers.  Both dishes were super tasty!  The service - just top notch!  Super attentive and friendly and they were really great about recommending options and favorites.   Cool space - I love the MGM so if you are craving a good sandwich or some yummy bar style food, this place is a great option!",

Bacon...with bacon jam...all the bacon goodness. I added tomato, lettuce, and pickles to round it off and the thing was huge. Overall flavor was good and is definitely a good dish to split if you aren't looking to eat a ton. Fries were OK. They had a BBQ seasoning on it which was good but they served the burger on top of the fries which made them a bit soggy.  Do yourself a favor and order some of their truffle aaoli on the side for your fries! Fried pickles were so-so. Too much breading in my opinion.   Solid 3.5-4 star joint.  Things to note: If you have a larger party...they will not seat you unless you are all there. We had 7 of our 12 folks and we had to wait until the rest arrived.  Service was a bit slow.  Plenty of food options to suit all needs.",

    "text": "Michale Mina Pub 1842 was a chill spot for a casual dinner where I had with my coworkers. The decor was cool--typography and solid colors. Nothing flashy or anything but certainly bold enough to grab your attention.We came during happy hour, but we unfortunately couldn't get it from the booth since happy hour is at the bar only. Can't stop me for having a good time though! The menu had a nice alcohol selection, so I stuck with a good, local citrus-flavored IPA for the remainder of the dinner.   Prior to going into Pub 1842, my intent was to get a burger. I ended up ordering the bbq brisket plate that came with sides of jalapeno corn bread and baked beans. I asked the waiter if the brisket was fatty, and then he went on a spiel about how the brisket was lean since it's the healthier option... to which I replied that I really wanted the fatty brisket. Lol. It's all about the flavor, baby! Anyway, he was happy to comply with my order.   The bbq brisket plate was fine. I've had better. The pieces were fatty just as I wanted it, but the bbq sauce threw me off a bit. The sauce was more vinegar-based than I care for, and I realized that Kansas City style brisket (Burnt Ends, right?) just isn't my style compared to Texas style brisket. The baked beans and jalapeno corn bread were pretty basic. Note to self: Don't order bbq from a place that doesn't specialize in bbq.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a very casual spot featuring hand crafted, artisanal fare at the MGM Grand, Michael Mina Pub 1842 is there for you.   Michael Mina is not the first Chef one would think of when it comes to a Gastropub experience but perhaps that is the point in Pub 1842 - forward thinking execution meets Pub Grub. The interior is meticulously clean and reminiscent of The Yard House with a Vegas flair to it that almost begs one to order a libation. The service is top notch, as would be with any institution with Mina's name slapped on it and the price point is fair for the quality with most offerings being in the sub-$20.00 area.   I stopped in with a good friend for lunch and found immediate seating with perfect sightlines to the countless OLED televisions around the expansive U-shaped Bar. I ordered the Steak Frites ($32.00) and the order appeared within a short 10-minute window after my IPA arrived.   Pub 1842's Steak Frites are a very basic affair including a 10 ounce Flat Iron Steak (cooked well north of the ordered Medium Rare), an Arugula Salad, and Barbecue spiced Fries with a side of house-made Steak Sauce. The Steak quality and seasoning were both superb, however, the execution of temperature was anything but. The Fries are a ho-hum experience that gets a bit better when they are dipped in the supplied Barbecue Sauce. As far as Steak Frites goes, this was a rather amateurish attempt considering the name branding and associated costs but I wasn't completely unsatisfied with my lunch - I just expected more from a restaurant bearing Mina's name.   Perhaps I ordered poorly, I have noticed most Yelpers rave about the Burgers and Barbecue. I will go that route upon my return but until then I can only muster a 3-star, A-Okay for Pub 1842 at the MGM Grand.",

    "text": "If you're someone who's visiting Vegas from the good ol' Bay Area, you can't help but try out, yet, another one of Michael Mina's restaurants while you're at it.  The significant and I had reasonably high expectations for this place, given Chef Mina's successes at his other restaurants, but were slightly bummed to find out that Pub 1842 very well resembled to the Bourbon Steak & Pub in Santa Clara, CA, which was just mediocre on my list.   I understand that they're both Gastropubs and all, but nothing mind blowing came out of my experience whatsoever.   ...Perhaps I didn't have enough drinks prior to eating at 1842?!  Not sure what it was but I wasn't really feelin' the vibe.  For our main entree, I tried the well acclaimed 1842 Burger ($18) whereas the significant tried the Double Smoked Bacon Burger ($19).  One of the main reason why I chose the 1842 Burger was because it had aioli in it, however when finally bit into what seemed to be a well-crafted burger, I was saddened by the fact that it didn't quite taste as good as it appeared. WOMP WOMP! The aioli was supposed to be enriched with hints of mushroom in it. Instead, it was super dense, not creamy at all in texture as I have experienced many times in other venues. Moreover, it tasted pretty darn bland. Huge disappointment, especially since my meal cost $18!  In all honestly, the Double Smoked Bacon Burger seemed much more appetizing than the 1842 Burger.   Only downside? ...It was too big! Yes, burgers can be \"too big\", to a point where someone can no longer enjoy it because they're unable to bite into all the layers.   I was better off just eating the season fries that came along with the entree. They were perfectly topped with cajun and herb seasoning. Finished them in a matter of 10 minutes.  Since I'm all about second chances, I look forward to trying 1842 the next time I visit Vegas. I'll consider trying out all the starters they have available in hopes that I won't need to order a burger to fill me up.   With all that said, I give this venue a solid 3 stars, mainly for quick, friendly service and a clean, subtle rustic-themed venue.  + Happy Hour every Thursday-Monday between 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM. + Group Dining Available to parties of 14 or more.",

That's a little steep, but you're in a casino. So it's Vegas prices.",

    "text": "Overall: 3.5 Food: 4 Service: 3  Happy Hour is ONLY if you are sitting at the bar. If you sit at a table you will NOT receive happy hour service. I do not like this policy. I always prefer tables because I find high tops very uncomfortable to sit in and tables are more spacious in general. Most places have happy hour specials within the whole establishment, not just within one section.   For appetizer we ordered the fried pickles. My boyfriend said they were the best fried pickles. I ordered the tomato soup with grilled cheese. The tomato soup was delicious; very creamy and well balanced flavors (not too acidic). The grilled cheese was just okay, it was very thin with not much cheese so the rye was overpowering. My boyfriend ordered the turkey burger which was delicious and juicy. We did not like the fries at all. The texture of the fries were great but they were smothered in this very sweet seasoning that reminded me of Steak N Shake seasoning (but at steak n shake its on the side so you can add as much or little as you like).   The staff were friendly but the service was very slow. We were seated before 2:30pm and didnt leave until 3:45pm. I find it strange that service took so long considering its in between lunch and dinner times.   For one appetizer, two entrees (the tomato soup being one of the cheapest items on the menu), and tap waters it came out to $50 with tip (18%). I personally don't feel its worth the price but they probably have to pay a lot of rent for their location.   Overall, the experience was alright. I enjoyed my meal but I probably won't come back again.",

Much better than some bigger name, higher price places that we wasted our money on. Our son, celebrating his 21st, said the trip out here from Texas was worth it just for their burgers. The staff is beyond top shelf. They make you feel like you are important, not a pain in the neck like many other wait staff at other restaurants. I hope we go back one more time instead of playing restaurant roulette with these big name disappointments in Vegas.",

While staying at the MGM Grand my friends and I were in search of legit grub. My Yelp search led me here.  The menu boasted heavily about the craft burgers, nachos and fried pickles. They had me at Nachos. So my girl group headed in and we were seated right away. We were seated next to a wedding party closest to the kitchen. Seating was comfortable.  The ambiance is a modern pub. A bar closest to the door with flat screens and the rest is booths and tables.  We walked in with our drinks from Fat Tuesday and started off with the Nachos. The Nachos. Man...those nachos.  Life changing. A XXL sized tray of Crisp, warm tortilla chips topped with cilantro,  black beans, tomato,  cheddar, sour cream. This is a prime choice when with a large party. We ordered 2 Salmon burgers, side salad A bacon cheeseburger and of course I ordered the vegetarian Falafel burger with a side salad. These burgers were....some heavy weights. HUMONGOUS portions.   The Falafel burger was the best I ever had like Drake. Crisp. Perfection. Chick peas drizzled with some banging Tahini. I ate half and saved the rest for my late night snack. My girls didn't care for the Salmon burgers.  They felt they were dry and I was happy I stuck to my falafel.   Mr. Mina, I'll be back to sample the craft cocktails.",

My wife (who doesn't eat meat) loved them because they tasted like a corn dog.  I didn't care for them because they tasted like a corn dog.  The flavors were very True to life and the sauce was excellent, but at over $5 each I felt the lobster got a little overworked.  Maybe a lesser ingredient would have made an equally awesome flavor.  But alas.    My wife got a kale and avocado salad which she loved, but I'm not a huge fan of bitter greens.  I guess everyone has their thing.   I got the \"Champ\" burger.  Best burger patty I've ever had.  So juicy and flavorful.  The sauce was really good, but a little messy and who doesn't love a ton of bacon.  This thing is a mess though, don't try to be impressing any ladies when you order it.    The service was very personable and friendly too.    I would definitely come back to try some different things.",

The fries with barbecue seasoning were also addicting and I nearly polished them all off, and would have had we not had a buffet brunch that morning. Yes, Vegas is for eating!

The markup on food was what you'd expect from a \"low food made high\"-type place in the middle of a casino, but the quality of the ingredients used really showed that the folks there are serious about the restaurant's concept.  Two things to keep in mind are that it is dark and it is loud, even by the standards of a rowdy pub. But it always seems to be possible to grab a table, which is a heck of a thing to have going for you in Vegas.",

Happy hour drink menu is decent. Cocktails and wine are included, as well as $3 drafts. I selected a drink that is pretty much a Moscow Mule with a fancy-fied name for a gastropub. I got a pinot noir in at the very end of the HH, it was decent, a fairly run of the mill California varietal.  Food is not included on the HH menu. O well. I was starving. Ordered the Double Dare Dog for $19. *facepalm* Well what can you expect? I shelled out twenty bucks for two hotdogs, wrapped in bacon, topped with guacamole, salsa (pico de galloesque) and Chicharrones. Came with unimpressive Luke warm fries. Hot dog WAS good. Flavors were playful, different. What you would expect from a gastropub. FYI: I had a serious tummy ache later... I think it was just too rich for my system.  Service was laaaah-AME! We were ignored at the bar by the bartender on numerous occasions. My drink sat empty without being asked for a new one. Bartender seemed uninterested... That is until we waved her down.   Ambiance is.... Fancy sports bar with expensive bar food. You must get ready to break out monies and just not give a crap about the fact you're paying way too much because you're on the Strip and it's Michael Mina.  Chance for return? Highly unlikely but not completely annihilated from my dining options.",

This comes with beans, kale slaw, roasted squash, 4 ribs, a good amount of pulled pork, and some brisket.  The sides didn't do much for us, I thought the kale slaw was the best of the bunch.  But the meats were all fantastic.  The brisket had good bark on it and was juicy.  The ribs were tender but still adhered to the bone, which is exactly how I like them.  The sauce was sweeter than I usually like, but it worked.  Also, it had a little bit of spice to it.  This is a massive platter at $32, I think sharing is a great option.  I would definitely order this again, not ready to bump 1842 up a star, but it's getting closer to 4 stars certainly.",

And a 99% chance that it will be sports playing if there is something going on!  The burgers are awesome, apps are delish, the service is fun.   It is definitely a touristy spot, and gets busy.

We enjoyed the lobster grilled cheese (spectacular, was stuffed with lobster and it tasted fresh as it was delicate and well seasoned), shredded pork sliders, and a couple drinks.

Thought there was a little too much cheese on it and I just scraped some off. The fries had a nice spice to them. Didn't even want ketchup near them. The burger was pretty big. I ordered it without bread and it was still a lot for me to finish.  The bbq plate was a good value. I sampled some of it off my husband. They had a great beer selection. OH, i was very surprised by the house-made Fireball. Did a couple shots of that. It was smooth and delicious. Really enjoy it! Intended to eat there again before I left but ran out of time. I will return!",

Then the food came had St. Louis ribs, Cole slaw and baked beans!  The ribs were perfect I could knife off the bone and a great seasoning of sugars salt garlic onion peppers!  Beans and slaw were ok.   Salad nice fresh and lightly dressed",

    "text": "Has the Little Bit of Everything\". That was very good, it was $43 but it was very filling. My son had the Brisket and it was done very nicely. The sauce was a nice compliment. My wife had the Green Salad, large portion dressing not over done and cashew gave it a nice soft crunch. My youngest had the kids cheese burger and it was big enough for an adult portion. We did the fries in Duck Oil with home made ketchup. The fries tasted pretty much like a fry tastes but that home made ketchup was really good. Nice atmosphere, they were plenty busy but we got in and served fairly quickly. We'll come back here for sure.",

    "text": "Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  10 of us went there for the opening of the NFL season.  First off they open at 10am, which is when the games started.  We literally sat down for 30 minutes before we had to ask a waitress who our waitress actually was.  It was 63 minutes before the first of us got a drink and another 25 minutes before we got food.  Then the entire section wanted them to change a channel for a different game and the manager refused to do so, even though no one was watching that TV.   I would recommend to everyone that they should never step foot in this restaurant.  If I'm Michael Mina I would be furious people are giving me a bad name by running one of the worst restaurants I've ever been in.",

    "text": "Let me start this review by saying that this was not my first choice for dinner tonight. To be perfectly honest, this wasn't even on my radar of places to visit for dinner tonight. Living in Las Vegas you try to avoid going to the strip, especially on the weekend! But let me tell you that the bar tender Davey made me feel right at home! I sat down not really knowing what to expect (the service on the strip many times leaves something to be desired), but to say Davey exceeded my expectations would be a gross understatement. From the friendly banter to suggesting the perfect beer for my meal he was on point like icicles! He paid such close attention not only to me but each and every patron at the bar it's like he was old friends with everyone! I can't say enough about the level of service he provided and I'm sure he is an asset to this team or any! Not to mention the food was awesome. I had the nachos and they were delicious. I was incredibly pleasantly surprised by my experience here and there is no doubt that I will be returning! Can you say regular?!",

    "text": "I'm giving this place 3 stars for the uniqueness of the menu. I enjoy seeing new things on a menu and this place delivered! We came for lunch and were seated automatically.  Our server popped right by for our drink order and seemed irritated that we were only having water. I believe he asked us a total of 5 times if that was all we were having.  We were just relaxing browsing the menu and ordered the lobster corn dogs for an app. They came out quickly and weren't very hot or fresh.  Nothing great about them at all which was a disappointment as we had read other reviews raving about them. There was also a small piece of shell in one of them. The server stopped by twice to see if we were ready to place our entree order yet and once again seemed irritated that we weren't decided. We were simply looking over everything and wanted to try something different, not the usual burgers we can get anywhere. Finally decided on the turkey burger and the peanut butter burger for both of us to share. They once again came out very quick. The peanut butter was interesting,  not my favorite as it was caked on and made my mouth stick together. It overpowered the entire hamburger and other toppings. I tried scraping some off to no avail. Oh well, the point was to try something new so at least now I can say I've had peanut butter and bacon jam on a burger!  The turkey burger was delicious.  Loads of flavor, a tad dry but that's usually the case with turkey and the sauce evened it out. My favorite part of the meal was by far the fries! Hot, crispy,  perfectly seasoned. We tried the string and steak fries and both were great but my favorite were the string. Overall it was a cool place to come but the bland appetizer and the server brought it down a star. Maybe if I could give half a star I'd go to 3 1/2!",

I had the bbq brisket for $22 great corn bread but not enough baked beens, so I ordered creamed corn as a side $9 silly price but loved it. My wife had hummas with veggies, I hate hummus and thought it was very good. She order Their signature burger cooked perfectly this came with a big basket of fries. No drinks my bill was $70. Overpriced on the appetizers  and sides, but a solid choice.",

    "text": "Going through my receipts from our MGM Las Vegas stay 9/8-9/11...looks as if we made an appearance here at least once a day.  We ate/drank at the bar each time.  They are hustling behind that bar...busy, busy, but not too busy to be nice.  Our server the first two times was Amanda.  She kept a good eye on us and gave great service. Our third time two different guys waited on us, our receipt says \"Bill\" - they were great.   I like that they have hooks to hang your purse on at the bar.  My husband liked the multiple televisions with sports on (although his Packers lost...boo!).   He also liked their beer selection. They are happy to put your drink in plastic cup to go if you have to be headed somewhere else.   When I think pub food, I think heavy, greasy, and fried...(nothing against that, but we were there for an event and wanted our evening clothes to fit when we put them on).  We ordered the Crab Louis deviled eggs on 2 different days.  They are delicious and served on little bib lettuce leaves.  They put the eggs on a little bit of the stuffing so that they don't slide around.  That little bit of egg, wrapped up in the bib lettuce, was a nice little bonus.  We shared a wedge salad and had them add steak ($12 extra). The salad was really good.  The big chunks of bacon were to die for!  I asked if they made a BLT w/ that bacon - our server said only on Sunday and Monday brunch - so we had missed out.  A must-try next time.  We ordered a lobster roll to share the next time.  I always thought a lobster roll was on a roll or a hoagie type bread.  This came on toasted, sandwich type bread.  It was really good, just not what I pictured.  They had it split in two for us since they knew we were sharing.  They are attentive on making sure each person has their own plate when sharing, and also attentive making sure there were napkins (cloth) and silverware as needed.  This was a fun place to hang out and I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars on this one.  We tried this new Mina spot last night with high hopes.  Unfortunately, it was really nothing special.  After reading the previous post I was very much looking forward to dining here and I was excited to try the fried pickles but at 8:30 they were already sold out.  Our server recommended the lobster corn dogs so we gave them a shot.  He also recommended the crab cakes and the tuna starter.  The tuna poke was great quality and well prepared but we were not crazy about the lobster dogs or the crab cake.  I asked the server what kind of crab it would be and he said lump crab meat.  I asked what kind of crab and he didn't seem to know.  He agreed when I suggested 'blue crab?' I'm not sure what it was but it it didn't seem like lump blue crab meat.   For our sides we tried the mac and cheese, mushrooms, and corn on the cob.  The corn was the winner.  Entrees: fish and chips- the fish looked great but it covered the fries completely in the basket and created a steaming effect that made the fries soggy. Also, the fish and or batter didn't seem to be salted or seasoned at all which was a bummer. Seared tuna- slightly over cooked but tasty Turkey burger- good, not amazing- but good, especially if you like spicy.  If you want a hip sportsl bar environment with average bar food Pub 1842 is a good spot but if you are a foodie expecting a little extra from Michael Mina I would suggest trying one of his other restaurants or give this one some time to work out the kinks before you visit.",

She was great for the first 10 minutes or so until a group of guys came in from a conference and then we didn't see her until she brought the bill. All we saw of her after that was her flirting, talking to the guys and bringing them everything quickly when they ordered. Food runners brought us everything after that. We never got asked if we wanted another drink, we were never checked on when the apps or main meal came. After we were done and just sitting, waiting, with empty water and drink glasses we were asked if we wanted dessert. At this point we just wanted to leave, we got the check and went somewhere else to have a couple more drinks. The drinks were great, frickles and deviled eggs were awesome (wish the frickles were chips, they were a little difficult to eat as the batter comes off when you slice them), the PB crunch burger was very good and lastly, the double dog dare was good BUT, tough to eat. It REALLY needs a top bun so you can pick it up. An open faced hot dog wrapped in bacon is a PITA to eat with a knife and fork. The taste was perfect though",

Once we ordered, I was talking to a friend while the server collected the menus and I didn't notice it, instead of just leaving the menu or waiting for me to realize what he was doing, the server just yanked the menu out from under my arms. It startled me. We ordered our food and some appetizers. After 40 minutes, nothing!! I couldn't track down any employee, so I got up and looked for the manager. The manager was just as rude. I told him this issues, very politely and all he did was nod his head. No sorry, he didn't even utter a word to me. I walked back to the table and our food was FINALLY there. The appetizers came out with our entrees, 2 of the dishes were messed up and one side dish never even came out. And again no apology. I get it, there are bad nights in food services, I was a waitress. All it takes is an acknowledgement that things got messed up. But we got nothing! Our bill came (we waited for it for 20 minutes!!!) and they even charged us an 18% tip for our large party. Again, we brought the manager over to tell him our concerns. The manager still didn't say one word after he heard our complaints, all we got was a head nod. One of my friends piped up and said that we should, at the very least, not pay for the 2 appetizers that we got. The manager nodded his head and I heard him say the first words to us of the night. His response was \"Fair enough\". Again, no sorry or \"I'm sorry you feel that way\". Never, ever will I eat here again.",

When the fried chicken and waffle salad came out undercooked I was so excited that I could send that awful thing back without having to say I was disappointed and the ranch dressing was sour. I wanted to try something new but it was not good. The few pieces of waffles were hard and small like cereal. They offered dessert since I did not want to try anything else. Dessert was ok. They serve mini milkshakes with each one they were good. The pecan dessert was the best. The chocolate cake tasted like old cold store bought cake. They also gave a key lime ripe of cake that they should be embarrassed to serve. I love that type if dessert but it was bad!   Don't waste your time here there are plenty if excellent restaurants on Vegas. I love to find out and this was not cheap and not very good.
