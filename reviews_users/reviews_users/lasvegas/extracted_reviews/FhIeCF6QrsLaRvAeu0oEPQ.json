Says she'll find our waitress. Comes back, our waitress is swamped so she'll help us. Drinks and dinner ordered after 10 minutes. 15 later-salad but no drinks. Finally drinks! With dinner. Waitress that took over was super friendly. Double baked potato was creamy and delicious. Rib eye cooked to perfection, like we cooked it at home but can never achieve  homey atmosphere. After 31 years in Vegas it was about time to check this place off my list and I'm glad to have finally come.",

Tossed salad with their 1000 island dressing is crisp and delicious.  Ribs as an appetizer, they were very good and tender.  Husband had a 12oz rib eye it was cooked to perfection I had crab legs and they were amazing.  We were seated so we could see the grill so it was fun watching them prepare all of the items fresh!  We will return real soon!",

Now my Dad who recently retired and moved here frequents the Ranch House too. We made reservations for Christmas dinner and were really happy with our meal. I ordered the Ranch House Wings to start out with and I could smell the vinegar tickling my nostrils as it was brought to the table. Funny thing is they tasted nothing like vinegar and I liked that. They were meaty and tasted good. My dinner came with a choice of either soup or salad. The soup was Lobster Bisque and that wasn't going to work for me. My wife suggested that I just try the salad so I did. I ate every bite of my salad it was so damn good. Every piece of lettuce, which was crisp and not a pile of leaves or weeds, had dressing on it. When my Porterhouse arrived I was a happy boy. It was cooked just how I ordered it. The steak was juicy and tender. My twice baked potato was hot and good. For dessert I had a Hot Fudge Brownie Sundae. The brownie was so soft and hot. I liked everything about my meal and it was a great Christmas Dinner. There is also a lunch menu if you want to try a burger or other sandwiches. The French Dip is made with their smoked prime rib and is mouth watering.",

You park in an unpaved lot and you get out and you smell immediately a wonderful smoky smell. The whole thing looks like a working ranch complete with grass and tons of kitties playing around in the grass. I found out later that the employees feed them so no wonder there are so many kitties playing in the grass!!!  You walk in and it's like a house transformed into a restaurant but a house from like the 1960s. It is such a fun environment. To start off I had the broccoli soup which was wonderful. Then I had the filet mignon with the potato hash. It was fantastic we had the chocolate cake for dessert. Also they give you a cheesy toast when you sit down. Everything about this meal was perfect. The service is wonderfulit's reasonably priced for the caliber of restaurant it is and I will definitely be back!!",

The location and parking were good and I love the look of the place from the outside. The prices were on the higher end, but then again I will pay more for a good steak and this was a good steak.

You didn't need any sauce to go with them because of the seasoning and juiciness of the steak was enough and perfect! I'm a steak type of gal and even though the place is a bit pricy it's worth every cent. We also got some seafood with our meals and the lobster is pretty big no little baby lobster tail it was a good amount for our entree. Oh and the twice baked potato is to die for!! I usually get fries with everything but here you have to try the twice baked potatoes. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the serves sucks! They are all friendly and when they do come around they do help you but they just take forever to come around. But overall great place that's hidden in the middle of nowhere.",

When I say \"rare\", 7 out of 10 times, the cooks give me medium rare.  If I wanted medium rare, I would order medium rare.  Sometimes, I have to tell the server, \"Just run it through a warm room\" to get my point across.  It's almost as bad as ordering my Thai food #10, and getting #5 because I'm Caucasian...not Real-Asian.  The down\"sides\" are the sides.  Boring veggies and potatoes.  Not that they need to add to the meat, but a little creamed spinach or some roasted beets would be nice.    I love the rustic cowboy setting and the servers are great.  Friendly and fun.  I also love the open grill so you can see your steak being prepared.  Great spot for some comfort food, cowboy style.  :)",

We made reservations we get there and we noticed a family in front of us at time of arrival and family after us  received the complimentary bread and even had the orders taken before we even got menus. 2nd we placed our order and asked for our 4yr old grilled cheese to come out when it was done. So let's say that didn't happen we did not receive anything until I mentioned to the waitress if our daughter food was done. She went to check comes back and said \"oh they lost your ticket\". So after an hour of waiting our food came. We were full of water so we couldn't enjoy our meal. She brought the bill and there was no discount for the problem we encountered. I asked her about it she got rude and said what we're we expecting. I asked for a Manager she said the owner was there goes away and comes back and said 10% is that good enough?  We said yet but wasn't happy we just wanted to get out of there. For a first time experience it was a disaster. There were families that arrived after us got there food and bill and left. 6pm our arrival no food till 745pm.",

    "text": "After 2 years of passing this place to and from work off the 215, my family and I finally decided to try this place. When we arrived, it was an interesting, yet nice theme to the building/area. Having lived up North and in Texas, I was used to this scene and enjoyed the change from the typical Vegas restaurants. We were \"kinda\" greeted by a lot of cats roaming the area (they must get some food scraps at the end of the night or something). Regardless, my daughter enjoyed seeing those cats. If you're a dog lover, beware! Ha-ha. Anyways, while we were being seated, we got to pass the grill that was cooking all the different cut of meat...such a great sight to see all that. We didn't order any appetizers because I was getting myself prepped for the 32 oz New York Strip. No, that is not a type-o....I meant it all....32 ounces of pure, slab of cow!!! The cool thing about it is if you eat all of the steak, you get a free dessert! Though I'm not a dessert fan, it was a great deal for my family. I was especially shocked on how great the flavor and tenderness were on the steak, considering the size of it. It would be wrong to say the decor is a bit dated, because hey, it's a Western theme dang it... it's supposed to look this way!!! Overall, good service and great food. Thanks for the experience!",

We were a party of 5 and 2 of us split a steak dinner. The waitress explained that there is a $10 split fee. Okay - no biggie. So we split the steak and each of us got a salad and a potato. The service was REALLY slow! We finally got our dinners (our salad plates and not been bussed yet) and all of our steaks were very over cooked. We asked for medium rare and they were well done. We didn't want to send it back and wait another 45 mins. After finishing we received our bill (our dinner plates had not been bussed!) and not only were we charged the $10 fee for splitting a plate but then we were charged another $10 for a salad/potato!!!! For another $1.99 we could've doubled our steak amount!!! Very frustrated. Didn't notice this till our credit card had been run and our waitress was MIA. At that point just wanted to leave. Poor communication on the costs and a waitress that was either too busy or just didn't care about this party of 5! We might give it a second chance since we frequent Vegas, but first impressions are lasting ones.",

This was the place my husband proposed to me 11 years ago (which may be reason in itself to burn it down!) hehehe he actually said that when we were walking in! lol We hadn't been there for 6+ years since the service was so bad the last time we were there. I am happy to report the service was amazing this time. Our waitress, Jill was very attentive and was great with the kids.   The food:  fried calamari: fried crispy and served with a really tasty remoulade sauce- yummy!   salad- standard steakhouse fare   cheese toast- it was too salty for the kids, but I liked it. It could have been seasoned a little less though.   ranch house potatoes- my fave of the evening. They reminded me of Cracker Barrel's hash brown casserole with whole mushrooms added. They were delicious!   12 oz. Rib eye- okay here's the reason I gave it only 3 stars. I ordered my steak rare and it came out like it literally hovered over the grill for maybe 30 seconds. Aside from the doneness, or lack thereof, it was a horrible cut of meat. I would never have recognized it as a rib eye! It was so tough to cut through I got a hand cramp! If it's tough when it's that rare...there is a definite problem. The worst part is that my husband ordered the same thing but medium rare and his was perfect. It tasted good and actually looked like a rib eye- which of course only added to my anger..lol.   The kids' meals were very reasonably priced and devoured the moment they hit our table. They both got the fried shrimp with french fries.   Overall the meal wasn't too bad. Everyone besides me enjoyed their food. It just pisses me off to pay $36 for the poor excuse for a steak they gave me. I would have complained but we were there with some friends celebrating their birthdays and I didn't want to be a downer. It will probably be another 6+ years before I return to this place again.",

I checked the reviews and I was very hesitant based on yelp reviews but I had a wonderful experience there!  The service was top notch. I believe the servers name was Nicole; she was wonderful and the food was amazing! Crab cakes were delicious, shrimp scampi was delicious and the shrimp were nice size. I had the fettuccini and scallops, it can easily feed 2 people. My husband had the filet and shrimp and he was very happy with it. He said he cut through his steak so easily \"like butter\" and the flavor was perfect. The Bartender was very friendly and made excellent drinks. I am so glad I came here and we will definitely be back. I wish we had room for dessert but maybe next time...",

    "text": "Arrived on a Friday evening at 5:45 p.m. it was nice and slow plenty of seating. I did call ahead for reservations which is recommended. Happy hour ended at 6 p.m. Ordered one of the specials which was the filet with a portabello mushroom and Bearnaise sauce with a twice baked potato standard salad. The restaurant provides a very tasty cheesy toast. The fillet special price between 30 and $40 was a good size for a filet, about a fork and a half tall.  I think I would order the steak again, but without the bearnaise sauce, and I would have preferred a porchini or shiitake change of taste instead of the steak textured Portobello. As the evening progressed this restaurant was progressively crowded with plenty of locals. The waitress was very attentive my glass never went dry. Drinks from the bar we were very timely. This place cracks me up. It is a converted ranch house just as advertised. You can see with the fireplace in the family room and the dining room and where the kitchen used to be, because it was a ranch house residence.  Very pleasant exterior with a homey kind of feel; exposed beams and dark wood abounds.  The cats lazing on the cool front lawn as I was leaving the restaurant was just another grin for this pleasant dining experience. There is no Wi-fi, no military or first responder discounts. All major credit cards are accepted or cash.",

While the prime rib was OK, the steaks, although ordered medium rare and medium, came out very well done with absolutely no juice on the plate.  Two of us reluctantly sent our steaks back and when their replacement arrived, they were cool rare in the center, obviously a message from the cook.  The server didn't know what to do and offered to send the steaks back and free deserts which we declined.  It seems that about every third time we have dinner at the BT's, the meal is a disappointment.",

It seemed like at least 30-40 minutes (maybe more?) before our food came out.

I had the Chicken cordon blu with mixed vegetables. The sauce they put on the chicken was so delicious.  I can't remember our waitress name but she did an outstanding job.  She made sure to check on us, but also let us enjoy each other and our food. After eating all we could, we were asked if we'd like dessert. How can you not try Dessert after all the other amazing food. We said No at first. But Quickly changed our mind. We Got a slice of Cheesecake to go. By the time we got home we were ready for a taste. And Ohhh man I'm glad we changed our mind.  So to the waitress that helped us. Thank you  PS. We did not use the Chocolate syrup or strawberrys when we got home.  We will be back.",

I was trying to book a table for 11 people at 5pm on a Tuesday for my Sons birthday party and she told me that I have to put down a credit card in order for her to reserve the time.  I was about ready to give her a card when I asked how my card was going to be stored  she said she was going to write it down on a paper.  I then said that I did not feel comfortable having my credit card number floating around on a piece of paper that I was not going to give her my card.  Since it was already 1:00 and we wanted to get there by 5 that we will just show up.   She then told me I was not not welcome to just show up unless I gave her my credit card.  I then responded back that so your are telling me that unless I give you my credit card we are not welcome. She said yes.  I hung up but called her back because I thought this was so wrong. First it is illegal to ask for a credit card to reserve a table.  I then ask her who the owner was and if I can talk to him.  She said his name is Jeff but he's not here.   I told her again that we will be there in a couple of hours and she repeated that I was not welcome with out a credit card Reservation.  SAD that people think they have the power to dictate what we can and cannot do.  We ended to making reservations at Via Brazilian Steak house.   It was great.  My Son takes his wife here said he will never go back because of the way April spoke to me on the phone.  Once again customer service is everything",

It's been super easy to get a reservation, including the weekend before the Tuesday Valentine's Day.  If you call early and leave a message, they'll call you right back and confirm; great customer service!  Additionally, the whole staff seems like they just can't wait to help you from the moment you enter to when you leave.  Now, for those newbies out there to Vegas, this is NOT The Strip style steakhouse with million dollar interiors.  This place has been around since before the 215 freeway you can see as you enter, so its style is old school and doesn't apologize for it.  I think it's great; spend your money on great ingredients, not artwork on the wall. We'll definitely be going back.  Order the fillet Mignon wrapped in bacon with portobello mushroom and sauce...yummy!!",

When arriving it was kind of a strange feeling, like you were going over to someone's house for dinner.  The inside of business has plenty of wooden features and older 70's style decor.   Dress code was causal.  The service was a standard, nothing terrible, just not lightning fast.   All food was cooked well and clean. One knock was the cuts of meat where not as high quality as I was expecting from a long standing steakhouse.   Worth checking out, something a little different to your every night dinner",

    "text": "We were in Vegas visiting family, and wanted to take them out for a nice meal.  My choice was to head over to Ghandi for some take tasty Indian food, but the group's overall palate wasn't up. To that. We settled on this place because my Sister had heard great things about it.... I figured you couldn't be in business for that long if you sucked....wish I had read the yelp reviews first before dropping almost $300 on second rate food.  Went in at 6 , and were asked if we had a reservation. No, we didn't, considering the (outward) size of the place didn't think we would need them.  We were given the choice of eating in the lounge...I'm ok with that,in fact I believe you can usually get better service in lounges/bars.  Our server was efficient and friendly, if not a bit aloof.  That was pretty much as good as it was going to get. Food was Sizzler quality,at best.  MY rare prime rib was med_well. Wife's food was cold,, mushroom on her special not even cooked. Our server did get her a new mushroom for her filet, which was also overcooked. . The appetizers (scampi and crab cakes) were amusing,in an amateur chef kind of way.   The rest of the group's meals kept the same,low standards... burnt baked potato, etc.  To add insult to injury, I was charged for 2 extra pieces of bread....classy. No manager presence to be seen until on our way out the door...  Our server did her best, and was friendly, but Decent service will never compensate for second rate food. Moral of the story: don't waste your time or money.",

I would have liked to give this place 5 stars and looked for reasons to do so but have to be honest.  The server was not at all engaging and my wife had to send her steak back twice.   When it finally came back medium she loved it.  My Prime rib was really good.  The staff mentioned they've been much busier than usual and it was in fact very busy.

    "text": "I have never had a bad experience here. I first went years ago for lunch and immediately fell in love with it. It was good food, in a nearly \"historical\" place, that smelled like a burning fireplace. County, if you will. At that time, I was searching for venues for my rehearsal dinner, and based on the size of the restaurant I figured this would be a great place.   A week later, I brought my fiance there for dinner. Everything was WONDERFUL! I had filet, he had prime rib and lobster. We were sold, this was the place for our rehearsal dinner!   I spoke with their manager over the phone and he graciously helped us plan a menu for our event. In October 2012, We had approximately 30 attendees, and our servers were so professional and relaxed, you would have thought we were a party of 4. Bob Taylor's will ALWAYS be on the top of our recommendation list. We have been to about every steakhouse in Vegas, but we love it here. It's a no-nonsense menu, good service, unpretentious, old school steak joint. No need to dress up too much, but show some respect and don't dress like a bum. All long-term Vegas locals know about this hidden gem.",

    "text": "OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...  There are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers.   FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care?   I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.    I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese.   A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush.   SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks.   I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.  Service: 4 stars  Kitch: 4 stars  Food: 1 star",

We were seated immediately and served quickly. We always love the rustic decor. Nothing fancy but we aren't there for the decor. We recommend the place to all of our friends. Just like some other places in Las Vegas, it's like a time capsule of the way dining should be- great food and excellent service.",

Not only did I receive a dirty glass but on further inspection realized that red liquid running down my glass was blood. How gross. I was horrified and throughly digested.

Gave us our check and literally said \"here you go\".  Owners don't care, staff doesn't care... not worth the price, wait and rudeness.

After I complained about the problems with the steak, the server told me that I must put all of the remaining steak on a bread plate for her to return it to the kitchen in order to get a replacement. Why not just take my whole platter? She told me she would bring me another medium rare, New York steak out right away. 15 minutes later, after all of our out of town visitors had long ago finished their meals, I was served another overcooked and tough steak. Again, I indicated the steak was unsatisfactory.   The server then launched into a lecture about if I was having trouble chewing I should have ordered a filet. I chose to ignore the rude stupidity of her comments. We asked for the check and when she brought the check she told us she had taken the cost of the steak off of the charges.

The twice baked potatoes needed more flavor, but had a good smooth consistency.

I will say the salad dressing was clearly house made and really good but the salad it self was WAY over dressed.   For $30-60 dollars a plate this place could step it up and  GREATLY benefit. They have been there a long time have an established name. The furniture could use an update...we were sat in a dark corner with what looked like a fold out table and event room chairs.

    "text": "Finally getting around to writing a review on this hidden gem.  Apparently this is the oldest operating restaurant in Las Vegas.  It's super tucked away, looks almost like someone's private home, and the decor is pretty dated... However the food is Extremely good.  I've had the smoked prime rib, filet, burger, shrimp, chicken, and so far Everything I've ever eaten here has been great.  Probably at least in my top 3 favorite steak houses in Vegas, and #1 in the Northwest side of town.  The service has always been really good too, very friendly and always accommodating to make sure you have a wonderful experience.  I highly recommend trying them out.  Make sure not to leave without having their Ranch House potatoes (I'm not sure if it's on the menu or exactly what they call it, but just ask and they'll know).",

While it is all of that, the service was 5 star, courteous, knowledgeable and attentive. However, disappointed with the food. My prime rib while medium rare as I ordered was mostly gristle and fat, a few ounces of edible meat.  Twice baked potato was excellent. My companion's chicken marsala looked and tasted as if it come from the frozen food section of the market. Very disappointing. While it was my first visit there, I might attempt a second visit, someday, I will be wary of what I order.",

Food is always awesome as well as the service, but the ambiance of eating on a ranch with a roaring fireplace during the colder months, allows for a very relaxing dinner with family and/or good friends.  Gave it a 4 star because I wish there were more window seats with a view of an out door garden. Otherwise, it's a must while in Vegas!",

When I got my beer and glass it didn't have salt but instead sugar. Waiter didn't return to check on us till 20 minutes later. Ordered 2 ribeye steaks, one medium well and the other medium. After additional 50 minute wait, waiter delivered our order to wrong table.  Waiter then retracted order to us. Finally, after waiting so long steaks were both well done.  Nice looking location but the food was not good. Steak quality is horrible. In all fairness waiter apologized for mistakes and give us free dessert. I would not waste my money here ever again!",

    "text": "What do you do after a four mile hike?  Try a new place for lunch with your hiking mates.  This is what landed us at Bob Taylor's Ranch House late this morning.  Two of us had the chicken wrap which in this case is fried chicken in a tortilla with lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing.  It was very good!  The only change I'd make would be to use regular grilled chicken, not fried, but the fried did give the wrap a nice crunch.  It was served with steak fries.  The third person in our group had the tuna melt, also served with fries.  She was very pleased with her sandwich.  For dessert, we splurged.  We had passed on an appetizer to go for the good stuff at the end.  We opted for a slice of carrot cake (it's huge!) with a scoop of ice cream.  The cake was excellent and it was the perfect sweet tooth ending to our lunch.  Service was terrific--perhaps because we were the only people in the restaurant.  I have a feeling that our server would have been almost as attentive if there had been 5 tables occupied.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.  After all the years of seeing the signs for this place or seeing ads, I'm glad we gave it a try.  I have a feeling that when we hike Mount Charleston and add lunch to our rigors, we'll stop here again!",

Total disappointment when we were seated, no one approached my fiance and I. After seeing this family get service before us I was like \"oh hell no, that did not just happen.\" I went to the hostess to tell her we've been sitting here for 20 minutes and no one has approached us, not even a drink order or anything. I wanted to walk out! She finally got the server but the server did not apologize for the wait or anything (this place wasn't even packed). She asked for our drink order and I told her we've been ready to order. I ordered the prime rib with the twice baked potato. It was okay!    Bob Taylor's Ranch House you totally disappointed me!",

    "text": "A friend was in the mood for some surf and turf, so I brought her to Bob's. I told her that I used to come here years ago before it was surrounded by homes and the freeway - so I was praying inside that the place was still as good as I remembered.   The service was awesome. I don't remember our server's name but I wish that all food servers were like this guy was. Friendly. But not so much that it seemed fake. Knowledgeable - but not arrogant. Attentive but not in a hovering sort of way. A few times I caught him looking around the corner to check up on the tables in his area. Couldn't ask for more.  The food was pretty good too.   I do have to mention though - the shrimp cocktail consisted of four shrimps and a tin container of cocktail sauce. I've never seen a cocktail served like that. Usually it's in some type of glass filled with the sauce and shrimp. Other than that - it was good.   I ordered the prime rib and lobster tail. I had my reservations when it was served because the lobster shell was charred so I thought maybe it may have been overcooked. After the first bite, I was proven wrong which didn't bother me one bit. It was explained that the prime rib was cooked in a smoker. I couldn't taste even a hint that it was smoked but nevertheless, it was flavorful to where I didn't even use much of the sauces or dips that the prime rib was served with.   For dessert, my friend and I shared a Tiramisu. I really enjoyed it because it didn't have a strong coffee taste. That may not be to other people's liking as it may not be what they're expecting but it was a nice surprise to me as I don't drink coffee.   As for the prices, it could be considered pricey however you'd pay a considerable amount more if you visited any of the other steak houses in the valley.",

Seating took an extra 30 minutes after our reservation time. We had a simple order, but they brought the wrong dish for one of us. They took it back but then obviously rushed to try to get the correct dish out as fast as possible, and it was therefore undercooked. Despite their efforts, the rest of us had finished eating by the time he got his meal, which meant the birthday guy had to eat undercooked steak while the rest of us chatted and the kids pestered for dessert. That's when we noticed that we'd never gotten our soup/salad. They offered to bring them out post dinner, we declined, but they didn't offer to take anything off the check.  Service aside, the food was just not great. You get plenty of it. I do not recommend the ribeyes - thin, I do better on my grill, one diner noted she preferred the ribeye at Outback. The filets and prime rib at other tables looked good. Maybe stick with those.",

Yes, you do. You want to be a part of the Supper Club.  Bob's is old school Vegas. Unpretentious. Just straight up food. Steaks. Potatoes. Drinks. Done. The vibe is down on the ranch, the cattle ranch, that is. Right here in Vegas, who knew!  When you enter there is a bar to the left, and then as you go to the dining area on the right, you see the mesquite grill -- with glorious meats being grilled right before your eyes!  My party got a nice little table in the back -- so we could not watch the grilling in action, but that is okay.   We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms and calamari. The mushrooms were heavenly, enveloped in a decadent white sauce. Calamari was excellent, not oily at all, and came with two dipping sauces. Next came my SMOKED prime rib, done medium-rare and amazingly good. PLUS I got the Ranch House Potatoes -- get these potatoes! They were so good. A blend of hashbrowns, mushrooms, and four different cheeses.   I was also brought a very simple vanilla sundae, with chocolate sauce and whipped cream with a candle in it for my birthday.   Bob Taylor's made my birthday one to remember. I would highly recommend Bob's for any special group outing, or if you just want a really good steak minus the typical steak house fanfare.",

A little disappointing to drive 45 minutes for sub par service. Sever took 10 minutes to get to the table, another 15 minutes to get a Diet Coke & glass of wine. Had to ask bus boy to locate. We finished off 4 pieces of garlic toast before any drinks made it to the table. Sever failed to refill beverages through out the meal. Asked manager and found out the server was not new. The other tables in other sections seemed ok. Next time we'll make sure not to sit in that section or go to bar.  Note seating a little cramped. We could easy pick up conversations from the table next to us, as knew the names of the unruly children who kept annoying their parents.   Recommend for late dinning or during the week.

Bob Taylor's screams \"old school\" -- far away from the fancy schmancy nouveau steakhouses on the LV strip for sure.  This place has stood the test of time -- that should say a lot in Vegas.    If you want a no-nonsense perfectly cooked steak over wood fire with a side of garlic mashed potatoes with a martini straight up or a nice cab, you've found your spot.   No nonsense, no b.s.   I always choose a sirloin cut, and the folks at Bob Taylor's delivered.   It was the perfect size, seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly to a medium -- every bite was perfect.   Very reasonably priced -- far cheaper than what you'd pay on the strip.     The service was very good and we wanted for nothing.     If you want a straight up steak with no frills, Bob Taylor's is your spot.  A bit of a haul from the strip, but well worth the trip.  Big thumbs up.",

Each of us thoroughly enjoyed every last bite of our meal.  We shared an order of crab stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, and I could have had just that as a main entree, it was that good.  However, I kept winning at life that night, as every new flavor that I was presented with was just as delicious. I opted for the French Onion soup to start, and it was flavored perfectly. They are generous with the cheese in the soup and it was wonderful. Next up was the honey BBQ chicken, and I chose Ranch House potatoes as my side item.   Every bite was delicious, down to the sauteed bellpepper and onion combination. Husband offered a few pieces of his prime rib to me, and I happily ate it up. The prime rib was like buttah!  We live all the way in Henderson and this place is so worth the drive. Tucked away in the middle of newly built homes, is the 1955 original building. It has charming twinkling lights strung from the building and along the courtyard, and has plush greenery in the front area courtyard.   You'll park in their unpaved parking lot, however, that just adds to the feeling that the place has been frozen in time. A nice little western themed delight in the middle of 'new Vegas' stucco and SUVs.   There are cats lounging in the plush grass out front, and I can only imagine why they are here-the leftovers!

    "text": "Bob Taylor's is a Vegas staple that has withstood the test of time.  There's a reason that it has survived in ever-changing Vegas; they do high quality steaks at reasonable (for steak) prices.   When you come here, you need to know what kind of experience you're going to get. This is a restaurant that looks like an old ranch house (see what I did there?) and has an Old West country feel.  You aren't going to find an 800 degree oven and tuxedoed waiters asking if you want sparking or still Voss. You can get that on the strip. If you want a good steak, cooked with perfect \"x\" grill marks, come here.   I've been here about ten times over the past few years and have never been disappointed.  I always get one of the ribeyes.  The past few times I've opted for the bone-in 22oz ribeye, medium rare ($47).  It has always been cooked near perfectly and has great flavor.  There's a subtle smokiness to the steak that you can only get from cooking on a grill, and it's rare to find elsewhere.   Soup/salad, garlic cheese toast, and a side are all included in the price of the steak.  The ranch house potatoes are like creamy cheesy hash browns, and are my favorite side. There's also an option of twice baked potato (very good), baked potato (standard), and several other options I've never bothered to try.   The desserts are also fantastic.  Ask what they have and trust that whatever you order will be a great finish to a great meal.   If you want to splurge on a good steak without having to pay extra for sides, then this is the place to go!",

Not even sure it was really a fillet-mignon. Definitely not a barrel-cut and for that price it should be! Chewy!! My wife's New York was chewy also and looked like a steak from Denny's! This place may been really good some time ago but it is not worth the money now. And the Men's room, a terrible place to send your customers! Once is enough and we will never go back! Not sure how this place gets good reviews??",

Now, by no means did they rip me off, I don't want anyone to get the feeling that they pulled one over on us or anything.    We came here as a big group for the $1/oz prime rib night.  Certainly a 16 oz. prime rib for $16 is a great deal.  To sum up the meal, it's extra $5 for the sides, extra for the drinks, and by the end of the night it came out to around $35 per person.  Certainly not a bad deal, but still a bit deceptive thinking your 12 oz. was going to cost $12.  The steak was cooked medium for a medium rare order, and the 1 level overcook seemed pretty consistent for everyone.  I would say quality of the meat would be considered okay, but certainly not at the level approaching anything close to Lawry's.    Service is excellent and pleasant.  Atmosphere is great and the western decor is appropriate to the name and atmosphere.  Not sure I would do it again, but probably worth everyone trying it once.  Table-for-1 Factor:  Probably not a great idea based on the crowd and the family-oriented atmosphere.",

The Steaks are less than average or worse, I would say that a Mcdonald hamburger is leaner and the place is not inexpensive. The atmosphere is tacky not a place for a romantic or fine dining experience, that would be OK if the steaks were good but as I said they are not. My suggestion go somewhere else, say North Beach Bistro if you want a good steak, locally.",

We were instantly seated and given menus. I was shocked as the prices did not match the decor...expensive. I had the fillet mignon and my sides were baked potato and clam chowder.  The chowder was great, given the fact that we were very far from the East Coast...in was near excellent. My main course was a small fillet and a massive baked potato loaded with sour cream and chives. Fillet was good, not great and the potato was okay. My take on this place is an old steak house with history in the area that everyone should try, but after that mystery is satisfied your money is easily better spent somewhere else.",

The price is high but worth. I suggest the owner use some of the money he is charging for the food and clean the place up. The atmosphere is dated and needs some sprucing up but it doesn't take away from the food at all.  The only problem we had was that it was the end of the night on NYE and the staff gathered in the lounge area where we were eating and they were kinda loud. It did not help our romantic evening but we made the best of it.  Happy New Year Yelp",

I polished off their ribeye and didn't realize it was disappearing until I had only a few bites left. I ordered mine rare and it came out perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend ordered his medium-rare, and he preferred mine over his. Family members ordered their blackened prime rib and filet mignon. We pretty much cleaned our plates off. Sides of baked potatoes and their house seasoned potatoes were shared. I preferred their house seasoned potatoes, they were like a crispy chunky hash.  We really had a lovely time here and it's such a hidden gem of our town.",

The salad wasn't terrible, but the scallops were bad and for $23 I expected more than four whole scallops and one torn one. The sauteed mushrooms were barely mentionable, even the baked potato was oddly flavored and really sweet. The vegetables were extremely overcooked. Everything is very pricey. We didn't even feel like risking dessert at those prices. On the upside, the steak was good, though a neighboring table sent theirs back, and our waitress was nice.",

    "text": "My Mother's Day was RUINED at Bob Taylor's Ranch House! I spent a couple of hours picking out a restaurant that would accommodate 15 of my family members and that would have a variety of food (as some of them have allergies) and within a reasonable price as some are new families on tight budgets. When I came across Bob Taylor's Ranch House their lunch menu was just that! I called and the first thing I asked was if they would be having their lunch menu for Mother's Day. I was excited to find out YES they would! During my phone call I asked 3 times if this was going to be the menu and was emphatically told yes all 3 times! Upon arriving we sat down and opened our menus to find that the lunch menu was NOT there, it was their dinner menu. I asked for the manager and explained my conversations when making reservations. All the manager could say to me was that the girl I spoke to was \"NEW\". When I asked if we could order from the lunch menu I was told NO! I went back to the table horrified because I knew some wouldn't be able to order the EXPENSIVE menu they had provided and so I wanted to leave. Seeing it was a holiday and most places had their reservations in place we probably wouldn't be able to go anywhere! My husband went to talk to the manager and she again could only say the girl was \"NEW\", which is not my problem and only means they didn't train her well! When he came back from talking to her he said that she told him we could leave if we wanted to! How's that for customer service & hospitality! Their employee, someone they hire, trained and left to represent their restaurant made an extreme mistake for us and all they could do was say she's new and we could leave! They didn't even offer to accommodate us in ANY way, nothing! Not a free appetizer, discount on the meal, let us order from the original lunch menu, nothing! I was furious, I didn't want to stay or give them my money at this point but we had no choice! Our bill was over $300 and over $400 with tip, FOR LUNCH!!! My lunch consisted of 4 pieces of shrimp scampi, nothing else! What should have been a wonderful day with my family turned into a miserable experience with no regard to the mistake their employee made and I will NEVER go back their, nor do I recommend anyone else going there if this is how they treat the people that keep them in business! They should have made an effort to take care of their customers and the manager there shouldn't be a manager as she has no people skills!",

I had the 80z filet mignon & the twice baked potato - it was so good! My guy had the 120z Club steak & he really enjoyed it  we had to take home a dessert and had the 5 layer chocolate cake for later",

We had Prime Rib, Lobster, Baked Potato, a very nice bottle of Mondavi Pinot Noir and Apple Cobbler for dessert. The three stars is for the terrible service. When we sat down it was somewhat busy but not overly so. It took over 15 minutes to get our bottle of wine and then between the salad and getting our dinner was almost 30 minutes. What could possibly take so long? The Prime Rib and Potato are already cooked and the Lobster is 10 minutes max. And then when we finally got the meal everything but the Potato was slightly lukewarm which means it had sat awhile. After a few bites it was just plain cold. I'm not going to mention the waitresses name but when we go back I don't want her to be our server. We will ask for someone else.",

    "text": "Mixed feelings. I had been wanting to come here for long time. Went for lunch. When we got there, nobody else was there. We were greeted by our waitress and sat.   Ordered and waited. I ordered the French Dip with French Onion Soup and my daughter got a hamburger.   Waitress brought me the soup. Instead of having the melted cheese and bread crust on top, it had cheese in the bottom of the bowl and croutons. It was good.   Got our food. Took a bite of the French dip. The bread was very good and the overall taste was good. I was thinking it's kind of weird there's no cheese on it and it didn't come with au jus. I was 1/2 done with my sandwich before the waitress came back. I asked her for some au jus. She went over and asked the cook for some and he looked put out that I had requested it. She brought it back and all was good though it was just a sandwich roll and roast beef. I had also seen him get a baggie of meat from the fridge and warm it in the microwave for my sandwich.   My daughter got the hamburger and said it was good. It looked and smelled good. The hamburgers are flame broiled, however they start out frozen making me think they don't actually make them.   The sandwiches are served with steak fries which I normally really like. These were just bland. The had no salt on them.   I took a paper menu with me. Got in my car and was glancing at it and it stated the French Dip has  Jack Cheese and Au Jus. Really? Mine had neither. We were the only people there at the time, how hard was it?  Our waitress was very nice.   By the time we left more people had come in and it appears they pretty much all got hamburgers.   The food was good and I would go back and try a hamburger and maybe for a steak one night (I live about 30 miles from there)  I honestly would have given 4 stars if not for the sandwich not being as described and the cook acting put out when I asked for the au jus  Oh on another positive note, I did notice the onions, mushrooms, etc for the hamburgers being cut to order by the cook.",

From numerous birthday celebrations, to simple date nights, I'm a big fan of Bob Taylors. For me, and I'm sure others, it reminds us of old Las Vegas. A simple, nice cut of meat cooked right there on an open flame. Home made cheesy garlic bread. Twice stuffed potatoes that are usually huge. And not much else. Sure there's pasta and seafood. But this is a steakhouse and unless your coming on Tuesday for the AYCE ribs, get the steak!   They don't have a bunch of fancy new age additions to their menus. No list of steak toppers. No truffle or foie gras to add, just good, home cooked food.  One thing I really love about this place, besides the fact that it feels like you're walking into someone's home, is the prices. Just the other night my other half and I dined here for $75 including a tip and wine! Rare to find that these days. And the service was great. I think Kristen was our servers name and she was a doll!  I'm very happy that this place remained as Vegas built around it. And from what I can tell, didn't change much except the size of their dining room.",

    "text": "Finally, after three visits over the past couple of years....the verdict is in.  Damn near 16 years in the Vegas before I paid Bob Taylor's Ranch House (BTRH) a visit.  We visited and I withheld a review.  Visited a second time, withheld...yet another review.  The mystique of something that perhaps might have been special..once upon a time, kept me from pulling the trigger.  Maybe the next time it will be different....maybe the next time it will be different...  My brother and his family were looking for a place to dine on a Saturday evening.  I threw out a couple of options.  BTRH being one of them because it is in many ways just so damn different from what one is  used to living in Vegas.  Different being in it's location and exterior and interior style but all this a great steak house does not make.....sadly.  Back to my brother, I threw out several options....he replied back, \"Ranch.\"  He also made the reservations, that I highly recommend if this is but your first time visiting BTRH.  Based on several experiences...the steaks are so so.  I found it them to be overcooked consistently more medium than the medium rare previously ordered. The simple garlic cheese bread is good to go, salads are good to go, the ranch house potatoes are good to go.  The service...mixed.  Now that the mystique is almost certainly gone.  I don't hate.....but I don't love either.  We shall see what the future holds.",

Arrived at 9pm to be greeted by at least 40 cats roaming the property. We are both terribly allergic. The restaurant and outside grounds  have definitely gone down hill. It needs a good cleaning. Upon entering the restaurant-you can see the dust on the wall hangings and lighting, and smell the musk! Husband ordered the Surf n'Turf and I ordered the double tails. Clam chowder was ok, Garlic Toast is yummy, sauteed mushrooms were way too tart. Filet mignon was cooked to perfection. My tails weren't cooked all the way through. I took 1 home and finished cooking it the next day. By the end of our meal, Both my husband and I were riddled with allergies. Watery eyes, sneezing, and stuffy noses. Not worth the money. Bill was $150. Probably won't be going back. Our waitress was pleasant.",

I have been going to Bob Taylor's for many years and have ALWAYS had great steaks and service; however on my most recent visit with my wife and guests from California it just was not the same.  I have always looked forward to the GREAT steaks; however, my Porterhouse this time was FAR below the standards they set before.  Perhaps new owners?  Buying less quality beef?  To say I was disappointed would be a major understatement.  My wife requested coffee \"after\" dinner; the server completely forgot this and his \"excuse\" was she ordered it when he was taking the order.  Just seems the younger servers DON'T have the capacity to listen anymore.  Maybe texting them would be better.  I sincerely hope this is NOT The End of an Era for Bob Taylor's but my most recent visit was a major disappointment.",

Bob Taylor's is about as far northwest as you can go and still be inside civilization in Nevada.  The dirt parking lot proves it.  You walk into a classy, yet Western themed restaurant that captures the feel of Old Vegas and the rugged West.  As you're led to your table, you walk past an indoor grill area where the meals are prepared.  Dinner, which for me, was the baby back ribs was exceedingly tasty -- and surprisingly affordable.  The prices run well below the celebrity locales along the Strip -- and every meal includes garlic cheese toast, soup or salad, and a side.   The ribs were incredible -- as was everything else on our table.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  In short, it's well worth the drive both for the food and the savings.",

Well the other night we decided to give it a try and was not disappointed. We drive up a dirt road to the Ranch House and find a place to park. We walk up to the entrance to see in the garden area a few cats in a nice garden. We feel like we are going to an old ranch house for dinner with our neighbors. We walk in and are greeted and seated right away. We feel like we are sitting in someone's living room close to the fire place. I looked around to see a lot of 'older' locals and some family's. I notice a lot of these people are laughing and having a great time. Our waiter was prompt and took our drink order right away. The drinks came fast and our order was placed. The food came pretty quick and boy was it good! The steak was cooked just like I wanted and mom had the prime rib. Oh yea and the garlic cheese toast was the best. (had to have a second order) So how did we like it? It was a great dinner with great surroundings. So if you have been putting it off for 30 years go give it a try. you wont be disappointed. We wont wait another 30 years. Like Arnold says... \" I'll be back!\"",

The service was not up to par for a place in this price range, and was neither pleasant or efficient. The salads were both ridiculously overdressed, literally swimming in dressing. I got the Smoked Half Chicken and it was dry and tasteless. I actually think it may have been microwaved because the bones were hotter than the meat. The leg bone was actually black.  My wife ordered the rib-eye and it was so tough that I have trouble believing it even was a rib-eye. When we complained, the server was not accommodating or even apologetic and it took way more complaining than it should have to get any accommodation.  TL/DR - A very expensive terrible experience.",

The twice baked potato was flavorless as well. I tasted the prime rib and it was good, not great. I can say the appler cobbler was very good, but for the price we are paying per meal, there are much better steakhouses in town.",

My wife ordered 12oz sirloin, and I ordered the 12oz smoked prime rib. I gave three stars because both of our steaks were cooked absolutely perfect, and our waitress was very friendly. Unfortunately that is where the good ends, the meat was very bland we had to use half of the salt and pepper shakers to make it taste like anything. I suppose the pricing was normal Steakhouse prices, but I feel like we could have gone to Outback, paid half the price and it might have tasted better. The Ranch House offers about five sides if I recall, three of them being potatoes and then vegetables or rice pilaf. Seeing as the only soup they had was a loaded potato soup I went with the rice pilaf that was super soggy like they used way too much water. My wife and I both decided once was enough and we would not be back. Hopefully they learn to season or marinate their meat a little better.",

After being seated we ordered our drinks we then noticed stuck on food on my dad's plate so when the waitress brought us our drinks he requested a clean plate. All was good. We ordered mushrooms for starters, they were good. Next, we ordered our meals. I ordered \"King\" crab and a lobster tail which also came with a clam chowder soup. The soup was horrible no flavor no meat nothing really just a milk base with a couple potatoes. The crab was a joke there was nothing \"king\" about it unless you were pulling it from your fish tank.  As for the lobster tail it was very pretty but no flavor and on the rubbery side. My dad ordered filet mignon and didn't even eat a quarter of it I think that speaks for itself. Service from our server was good but we won't be back definitely wasn't worth the money next time we'll stick to our original plan of Outback!",

    "text": "So I've lived in Vegas for over a year now and I've passed by this place more than a few times and wondered how good the food/service was.  Tonight we found out...not worth your time!   After being seated we had a very prompt waitress TO START.  She took our drink, appetizer and dinner order, then handed us off to another waitress because her shift was ending.  No problem at first, but then we didn't see our new waitress for about 15 minutes.  She finally came by to check on us, and asked if we were ready to order...already done that, and then she went and checked on our appetizer.  25 minutes later, it finally came out...2 crab cakes shouldn't take that long, but ok.  On top of all that, her attentiveness lacked when it came to drink refills, to the point that my fiance' had to get up and ask for more water...  Finally, about an hour after we were seated, our salads, which were limp and tasteless bagged salads.  Then dinner, we both ordered the fillet with grilled shrimp...what came out was NOT a fillet, looked more like thick NY strips, and 3 small shrimp...$34/plate.  Per the menu:      \"Your Steak is cut from the finest beef available in the United States.\"    Please tell us how you would like it prepared.  The food was prepared ok, but by this point we were not pleased with the the quality or the service.  It was about this point that I believe the waitress caught on, because she checked on us 3-4 times in a 10 minute period.  I went to speak to the manager, who was seated at the bar, a few drinks in.  I introduced myself, then began to talk to him about what was going on...explaining about the waitress hand-off, the lack of attention and then the over-attention, and then the food.  His response to me was, \"Well let me get you a gift certificate to make this better the next time you come in.\"  I told him straight up that I'd never come back here, and that for what they served us, $34/plate was a bit extreme.  His response: \"Well, you're not going to get the kind of quality for that price anywhere else in Vegas, believe me.  That's really all I can do for you.\"  Ok...I guess my last year in Vegas was all a dream, because there are plenty of places that are of much better quality for the same price.  I felt very dismissed, told him thanks for his time, and then went back to my table to get my check.  The waitress asked if we wanted everything wrapped up...about half of each of our meals left, and we said \"NO, just the check please.\"  She figured it out at this point, and we told her we had spoken with the manager about everything.  She got us the check, which was now 1/2 off, magically, and a $50 gift certificate to come back.  I paid my bill, and we beat feet out of there.    Decor aside, or lack thereof, this place is AWFUL!  If you're in Vegas full time, spend a few extra dollars and get a steak worth your money somewhere else.  Don't waste your time going here!",

I've been a Bob's customer since 1986 on my first visit to Las Vegas and it is the only place I make absolutely sure I get to for a meal every time I'm there. So much so that I've had free steak dinners offered to me at top-rated steak houses in LV but I still go to Bob's.   When I ate there the first time, the Interstate hadn't been built and Bob's was on a long dirt road where the surrounding houses all had hitching posts outside, and usually if we got out there before sunset some neighbor would be out on a horse. Bob's still has a hitching post outside, but the road leading there is now a part of a gated community, though thankfully Bob's left their end of the road, well, \"period\".   The interior is NOT \"steak house modern\". It is exactly as described: a ranch house, and I love that. Fireplace; lived-in wooden chairs; open-fire cooking area; wood paneling with cowboy-movie posters on the wall. A real old-school elbow-on-the-bar bar. It's just great.  The steaks are as good as I have had anywhere and always come cooked as I requested. Sides are generous. Drinks are REAL DRINKS, not the tourist/kid drinks you get sometimes at \"fine\" restaurants, so be warned.   Bob Taylor's isn't for every taste. If you're a millennial looking for a protein source delivered anonymously, that's not here. If you're looking for Ruth's Chris, this ain't that place either. But if you want to visit and appreciate one of Las Vegas's finest restaurants, its oldest steak house and a reminder of what LV was like before The Strip was even thought of, get here. It is entirely authentic in every way. And the steaks are excellent.",

As our waitress took our order a request was made for her to ask the kitchen staff to cut his steak into bite size pieces.  It is obvious he didn't speak and was disabled. She brought our food to the table with his steak whole.  We reminded her that his steak was to be cut.  Her exact words \"the kitchen is too busy\".  So we all sat and waiting while another guest at our table cut his steak.  He was embarrassed and it was shameful.  Once his food was ready for him to eat, we all began to eat.  The food was nothing as we have ever been served here.  Coming here once a month we are familiar with the food.  My usual order of Prime Rib extra rare was not prime rib and was tough.  I'd had zero marble and zero taste.  No way was this slow roasted cut of prime rib.  It was a cut of poor quality grilled unidentifiable beef.  No drink refills without flagging her down.  And we will mark this once great place off our list of regulars.  My food aside, refusing to cater to the handicapped is shameful and a disgrace.",

We've had several different servers since we go so often and each time the service has been execllent, as a server myself I really appreciate it!

The service was Quick & more importantly Accurate. I love the Western theme. It has numerous pics of John Wayne, Dale Robertson & other \"Cowboys\" from the past. I'm tired of the high priced, pretentious Steakhouses in Vegas. You know the names. I can afford to pay more, but why should I ?    Oh you \"Vegans\" can stay away. Nothing for you here.  You can watch them cooking your Mouth Watering Steak over the Flames. I'd recommend the 16 oz Rib Eye. No dessert wanted or required. You will leave \"Stuft\".",

The parking lot is crumbling, weeds all over, the building is old and not in a good way. I've eaten here once before and the food was good, the bread is incredible. I was expecting the same this trip but it was pretty bad. The drinks were watered down, my steak was over cooked, and what really kinda pissed me off was that the cake, that we brought incurred a cake cutting fee. By the way, they didn't cut the cake for us, they literally just dropped it off at the table. They said they charge that any time you bring in a dessert. Call it petty if you will, I wouldn't think twice about paying that at a nice steakhouse. However this definitely isn't a nice steakhouse.   All this aside, our service was great at the bar and at the table but the prices and fees don't match the environment. If I'm paying good money I want a nice environment as well.",

Not a huge deal as long as the food and service was good. I should've know the food was gonna be mediocre when they brought out the bread. It was room temperature white toast with some kind of (cheddar?) cheese melted on it. Took one bite and put it to the side. The salad was way over dressed. The calamari was ok. The service was slow & just awful. My mother in-law order the prime rib. She made it painful clear, end cut, WELL DONE! Guess what? Came out medium rare. After sending it back 3 times it was finally at a temp where she could eat it, but we were all done with our meals. The beef was definitely not worth the price. This brings me to my biggest gripe with this place, it's way over priced for mediocre food and service. We can have a better meal at Montana meat for 1/3 the price. Won't be back.",

    "text": "First the negatives, then the pluses:  I can see why this place might not be for everyone.  There isn't much in the way of vegetarian options.  (I don't think we can expect them to apologize for this, it is a steak house after all.)  When you order an entree, you get your main course and ONE side, as in potato OR vegetables, instead of your choice of potato and a vegetable.  The cheesy bread really does seem like someone put cheese on Texas Toast and placed it under the broiler.  The tables are so close together that you feel like if you move around too much in your seat you'll disturb the party seated at the table next to yours.  (The waiter couldn't even walk all the way around our table, and it was not a booth and not next to a wall.)  Due to the crowding, it's so loud you can barely hear the waiter's recommendations.  Now for the positives:  The food is well prepared.  We've only been once, and maybe we caught it on a good night.  Or maybe it's the style of food.  This is the type of food my grandfather would have appreciated.  Hearty and very lightly seasoned.  A scant touch of salt, garlic and paprika was all that needed to give a meal flavor.  You can taste the food, rather than a bunch of salt.  The salad dressing is homemade, and tasting the salad with house dressing took me back to my childhood.  The cheesy bread reminded me of what we would have called \"garlic bread.\"  For me it was nostalgic.  The decor and ambiance:  It's what it might be like eating dinner at the Clark County Museum or the Spring Valley Ranch State Park.  I loved it.  I've always wished that we could go down to the museum, walk into one of those preserved homes, and eat a dinner like we used to have in the 60s and 70s.  In fact, what a great outing it would be, to go visit the museum or the State Park, walk through those homes, and then top it off with a dinner at the Ranch House.    The dessert:  It deserves a separate category of it's own because they don't make it in-house.  But it's worth it.  The portions are big enough to share.  We ordered the tiramisu, and the apple cobbler, and shared both 4 ways.  It was pretty amazing.  The service:  Very professional, efficient, and friendly.  Very nice.  We have a disabled family member, and they were extra kind to him, which always warms my heart.  The crowd:  Most of the license plates in the parking lot were local, which ought to tell you something.  Many of the staff seemed to know some of the patrons on a first-name basis, which seems to tell you something more.  If you are going to a steak house, are you going to go to a big chain, or are you going to visit a locally owned place, especially if it's been around  for decades?  We will most definitely be back, and while I realize that a place of business needs to change to keep up with changing tastes, I hope they never change this place too much.  It's like taking a step back in time.",

    "text": "We live across town but wanted to try this restaurant based on positive feedback from friends experiences so our expectations were high.  We had the worst waitress (Liz) I have ever had and we eat out a few times a month. Our table was trying to enjoy two birthdays that night and we will NEVER be coming back. The waitress has been doing this job for over 9 years and must hate it because her facial expressions led me to believe any questions were quite annoying and redundant. My son ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs which never came. When we reminded her about them, she brought them out and claimed to be fresh, she was clearly mistaken because they were cold and dry like they had been sitting in the pass for a long time. She also forgot to take a 1/2 rack of ribs off the check because they were dry and cold after saying they just came out of the window.  She also up-selled an order of french fries while making it sound like they came with something we ordered.  My friend ordered a brownie sundae and there was barely a brownie there and when the waitress asked if she would like another brownie, I asked if there was going to be a charge.  She replied with attitude YET AGAIN, \"Well, there usually is, but since you are UNsatified, I can go ahead and not charge you.\" Like we did something wrong.  I am not a person who has trouble speaking their mind and I also believe service is reflected in the tip.  Needless to say, she deserved NOTHING.  I only left her a $5 tip on $50 (my portion) when I wanted to leave her NOTHING.  I wrote a note to the waitress suggesting she may want to change her attitude especially being she has done this for over 9 years. I noticed her reading it while walking back to the kitchen and saw the hostess and other waitress reading it as well. As I was walking out, the hostesses were looking at me and I knew they read it too.  My son told me the waitress flicked me off as I was going out the door.  In my opinion, someone with that much tenure being a waitress should be able to handle a large party easily and our table wasn't even difficult! ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, she came back and asked us to please take our party to the lobby to continue chatting because they had other parties waiting. I was livid.  I will never be back here, EVER. I have several restaurants that have quality of food AND service in this wonderful city of Las Vegas that I will willingly give my money too, but Bob Taylors will NEVER see a penny from me, my family, or friends.  I will be more than happy to spread the word about that evil waitress to make sure if they happen to go to make sure they don't get HER.",

Both are a real plus.  Your old place is really special find in today's chain restaurant world.  We started off good, the service, the atmosphere, the soup, yummy and the salad fresh and good.  But then the main course comes and I am sorry Bob, but sour tasting pork chops and just as sour baby back ribs is just not right.    I tried to determine the flavors, I got the rosemary and I think the meat was marinated too long in a red wine vinegar type marinate.  The nice waitress could only confirm the rosemary.  But Bob, both portions (which were really nice sized) were just to sour for my and my wifes taste buds.

    "text": "I have lived in Las Vegas since 1976 and frequented BT many times over the years. My wife and I were having an anniversary in July and thought what a perfect place for a nice dinner. I made reservations in advance. We were seated on time but way in the back of the restaurant next to the exit door and directly under an air conditioning duct blowing extremely cold air on both of us, so much for advanced reservation and they knowing it was our anniversary. I said something to our waitress ( which I might add was extremely good and friendly ) and she suggested we move to the other two seats, which was a little better.  I asked for a large bottle of pelegrino for us to split but they only carry small bottles of perrier, so we had a couple of club sodas with lime. We ordered a couple of appetizers, one calamari and a shrimp cocktail, the calamari was left in deep fryer to long and was very crispy ( not good ), the shrimp cocktail consisted of 4 med. size shrimp on a lettuce plate, I was thinking about the 99 cent cocktails and how overly priced this shrimp cocktail was. we order our main meals and my wife wanted the chicken fettuccine and I ordered the filet and lobster tail, the chicken fettuccine came on a very large plate ( must of been a pound of fettuccine ) sort of what you might expect at the Claim Jumper, the sauce was very bland with not much flavor. The rib eye was over cooked ( not the med rare I ordered ) and the lobster tail was left on the open flame grill to long and was burnt and tough. I could of sent all the above back but knowing by reading other Yelp reviews my wife and I wouldn't have been eating together as the meals would of been delivered at different times.  The highlight of our anniversary dinner was the fudge chocolate cake, which I am sure wasn't made at Bob Taylors Ranch House and was very good. I wrote a letter to the owner of BT and received a phone call from manager April. I explained the experience and she said that she would get back to me. A week later I received a gift certificate from BT and it was for a whooping $25.00. I called April and asked if this was some kind of sick joke ( $25.00 ) and she said no, I told her I was insulted by the amount and having spent that night over $150.00 it wasn't quite adequate She said the owner Jeff told her how much to send. I told her to tell Jeff to keep it and buy a nice bottle of bourbon to drink as his restaurant fails. I mean really the $25.00 would of payed for two desserts , a couple of drinks and the tip. So sorry about Bob Taylors it was a fine dinner house for years but I will not be going back again. The thing about restaurants in Las Vegas is the mediocre ones don't last long as we have some of the best foods and chefs in the U.S. But i suppose Jeff will be able to live off the past reputations of the restaurant for a while before closing the doors.",

Got out the car it smelled really good from the outside. We were greeted upon walking in and asked if we had a reservation I stated we didn't, she rolled her eyes and grabbed some menus. We were seated in the middle of the dinning area in front of the fire place. Severs all around!!! No one said hi, offered us drinks or water, or even like hey so and so will be with you in a minute. We must have sat and watched the table near us get their check, table to the side of us get food. No one said anything after 20 minutes we walked out, TERRRIBLE TERRIBLE customer service. Willing to spend the money for a good meal, however customer service is a must. No one even blinked an eye when we walked out either. Couldn't believe it. Went elsewhere ate a good meal tipped well and carried on with our evening!!! If you are under 50, you will not get any kind of service in this place!!! Will never return will only tell people how horrible your customer was.",

My daughter ordered BBQ Beef Tips off the kids' menu. They too were drowning in a heavy sauce  meant to hide & not accentuate the meat.  Otherwise,  staff was nice, but would not recommend.",

Decided against the appetiser as we didnt think we would finish the main course, but you get a salad and garlic bread included with your main meal as a starter. so no point ordering separately as it will just cost you more.   **So my tip, unless theres a starter you really want, just get the ones that come with the main.**   There was more than enough food there for us! I had filet steak which was amazing and the prime rib was pretty good by all accounts too. Not a fan of ranch potatoes though, double-baked is the definate way to go! Highly recommended. Enjoy!",

    "text": "My husband and I went here on a Tuesday night after reading the reviews on here. That time the service was Excellent food cooked to perfection...except I don't know why everyone raves about The Twice Baked Potatoes here. It was hard as a rock and hardly any potato to eat inside. The wine selection is less to be desired. Despite all this, when our very dear friend came to Las Vegas to visit we wanted to take him here. Bob Taylor's is Not the type of Lux steak house our friend is used to, but he was excited to see just this type of sawdust joint. This time went on a Monday night. It took someone 20 mins just to come over and ask if someone was taking care of us. We were standing up and leaving when she finally came over to the table. Our friend ORDERD the Calamari. It was the only thing he ended up eating that night. He ORDERD the porterhouse steak MEDIUM. The entire thing was WAAAAYYY OVER COOKED. Well done is an understatement. My filet was fine but my Lobster Tail was WAAAAYYY OVER COOKED. Flaking apart, not wet n juicy. So we politely asked to send them back. She brought out my new Lobster Tail. Perfect! Well 35 minutes later our friends Porterhouse STILL had not come out!!! When it finally did arrive, it was RAW!! Like really really raw. Like the cook just threw it on to seer the outside on both sides but the inside was completely RAW!! Gross!!! It's like we were in the movie WAITING. So, my friend was disgusted, we were embarrassed anD asked for the check. All she did was not charge for the Steak, and take the Calamari off the bill.  I would've given one more star but we won't be going back here since the cooks don't a crap about how your food comes out they'd just rather close the kitchen. I might add we were there 3 hours before closing time...and a party of 8 DRUNK people stumbled through the door about 5 mins before we left. Also won't be going back because management doesn't care either since we asked to speak with a manager and were told by our server that there wasn't one on the shift. It's too bad bc other than my twice baked potato on the first time went, we thought we had found our new favorite place to go and bring all our friends and family. Oh well",

The food was tasteless, and swimming in sauces that weren't appetizing. Over priced and definitely not worth it.",

For a place that was here since 1955, you know it has to be great.  I like trying little place's like these since it's known for great food. I went here for my friends birthday dinner. Here it goes:  Great atmosphere and service was nice and friendly.  Food was alright.  I've definitely had better.  I know that this place is known for their steaks but I was craving fish so I ordered halibut and my boyfriend order filet and shrimp.  I've had better halibut; dry and overcooked.  My boyfriend ordered his flit medium which shrimp was great but his steak as he cut into it was still raw and this is when he ordered medium so he couldn't eat it because it was that rare so he asked the waitress if he could take it back to have it cooked a little more which they did and he cut opened into it again it was still rare.  At that point he was over it and didn't want to eat it.  I like my steaks rare so therefor I wanted to take a bite of it and it had no taste what-so-ever.  It was Blah! My friend ordered a ribeye and I would think it would look somewhat better.  It looked like a piece of paper.  Her husband ordered a steak as well and his was overdone. To the end of the meal we ordered dessert and had the brownie fudge with ice cream. No taste and where was the brownie?! Another BLAH!  All and all, everything was pretty much fair.  Just the food isn't what I thought it would of been considering all the rant and raves about this place.  Most likely wouldn't come here again on my own unless there was another special occasion.",

They said they cook the steaks over mesquite coals. It would be nice if they told you that when you order. Mesquite to me tastes like propane residue on my steak. Unfortunately ruined a perfectly good steak. We went on a Tuesday, so it wasn't super busy. The service was fine, attentive & friendly. Going back to Montana Meat Company instead.",

    "text": "We've passed by this place for years and my husband finally decided to go try it. He had been talking Prime Rib for almost two weeks.    We called ahead to see if you could order the dinner menu during lunch, and the lady said, yes.  Perfect!! We get there for the Prime Rib (the main reason for our visit), and that's when the lady informed us it is only served after 4 p.m. That would have been really nice to know when we previously called.  Sauteed crab cake: Nothing about this thing is sauteed, that baby was deep fried and not tasty at all. Don't waste your money on this.  Crab stuffed mushroom: Don't waste your money on this either.  Use caution with the Medium rare/Medium  Bone-In Ribeye: Hubby said it was delicious! Although he asked for a thin pink center all the way through, that baby had a thick pink center. It was beautiful!  Rack of Lamb: These were pretty good, but I should have gone medium instead of medium rare. However, I knew once I reheated them at home they were perfect medium rare. Yes!  Service: Horrible! After delivering our meal, our waitress never came back to see if we needed anything, not even water. I had to ask the other server for it. And then for a to-go box, she handed me a styro foam container. I was expecting more of a take to the kitchen and wrap for me, especially for these prices.    Outside entrance: Who do those cats belong to? Or are they stray? Suggest getting rid of them; creepy for non-cat lovers.  I highly doubt that we'll ever go back, but if we do, maybe we'll get a chance to experience the Prime Rib. Yeah, we'll be sure to arrive after 4 p.m.",

Our server, JaNiece, was helpful, polite and had a great sense of humor on such a busy day. The food was delicious including our calamari appetizer.  Our salads, although not mixed greens, was fresh and very tasty. Our entrees, rib eye-bone in, prime rib and porter house were cooked per our request, very well seasoned, no steak sauce needed. The baked potatoes are huge and come with all the fixings. Needless to say each of us had to take food home and it provided another full meal.  Thanks for a good time. The ambiance is western with nice memorabilia of the western movie stars.  The attire is business casual to plain ole come as you are... Thanks again for good food, exceptional service and a good evening.  We will definitely return to this restaurant.",

The service was friendly and adequate though it was clear they were severely understaffed.  The food was average.

Framed photos of John Wayne and the Rat Pack era adorn the walls. Big leather saddles sit randomly throughout.   Then the waitress!!! A gal who knows her stuff wanders over and takes our detailed order without writing anything down because she doesn't need to. She's a rock star, an ace, the queen of her section.   Everyone's food arrived quickly with every special request met. Soup, salad, steak, chicken and fish was all incredible! Delicious food at an affordable price is icing on this charming restaurant's cake!  The location is tucked away suited for locals. Don't let that keep you away.

I asked for a glass of water & lemons on the side. She brings me to lemons from the bar area stat she grabbed with a napkin and brought it to me with my glass of water! I didn't ask her if I can get fresh lemons in a bowl on a handed her plate that she gave me can you put it on a plate then she said absolutely. I also order a glass of wine with my order which I ordered a steak I explained to the waitress that I would like it to be more on the wild side with just a little bit of pink for the juiciness. She didn't say how or where you want to meet him well I so well I don't really want a lot of pink in it I wanted to be on the more the well side. She says okay I will put your order in. While waiting for my food my wine came in the glass was dirty! Didn't notice it when she brought it to me cuz I was watching the game however when I wanted to take a sip of my wine that's when I noticed it it took me 20 minutes to come back to me I'm the only one in the bar area at a table. Then I seen another waitress and ask her if she can take this glass of wine back and showed her where was Dirty she did and she brought me out another glass of wine I don't know what happened to my waitress she never came and check on me while I was eating when I got my food my steak wasn't like I ordered it. It was more pink on the inside then I like it. It was a very disappointing experience and I don't know if I will go back again",

It is in the middle of nowhere, and you drive through a neighborhood of houses before you see the famous wooden lined entry way, just like a ranch house. The walk to the door is lined with white lights and beautiful green vines with a little flower garden. Inside, it is lined with wooden panels and filled with tables with white table clothes. There are some photos on the wall, some depicting old movie posters of old westerns. There is nothing glamorous about the inside, but its simplicity still makes you feel like you are in a nice place and the appropriate place to celebrate a milestone.   The side salad, the twice baked potato, and the cheese toast were alright, nothing to go out of your way for and nothing that will leave its mark on your taste buds. The steak however, lived up to everything it promised and more. It was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth -juicy and didn't need anything else to go with it. Come for the steak and the unique atmosphere, that won't let you down.  Our service was good, not quite on par with what I would expect from a finer dining situation, but nothing so lacking I would complain about it. Our server kept our dinner at a leisurely pace, taking some time before taking our order, or clearing the dishes to bring on desert.  The prices are lower than many similar steakhouses, but the quality is matched if not exceeding.",

Then a week later we took my son and his girlfriend out for dinner. From the service to the food it was mediocre but the price is right up there with the best of the steak houses. Any how it should not ever be hit and miss at these prices it should be consistently good My family has patronized Bob Taylor's for 45 Years. I would expect more form this business. Oh and we ordered Old Fashioned from the bar.... I give it A *** also No muddled orange or cherry and no bitters. All in all very disappointed in Bob Taylor's Ranch House tonight.",

Food...if you like nothing but breading as your $11 appetizer as calamari, lobster soup that has approximately 0.01% lobster, two steaks ordered the same and cooked very differently, than this is your place!!!!  The only reason why this place has lasted this long is because their rent is probably nothing worth their  run down building and horrible parking lot. They should be embarrassed to call themselves a restaurant let alone a steakhouse. Please please please do not go here as it is not only a disappointment, but a horrible disappointment on every level. They should fire everyone (including the manager and chef) and start over. On the bright side, if you enjoy paying for things that you don't like and things that should not be served to customers and getting a ton of excuses by the staff as to why they aren't good but not taken off the bill, this is most certainly your place!!!!!!!",

Host: Your table will be ready in a few minutes the party has paid their bill and are leaving. After being seated it's about 8tish, We look around there were sections of tables that could have accommodated our party, but it was either White privilege, Ranch House didn't want to inconvenience them to wait for a table or Very poorly trained help. A good restaurant would plan ahead or have some common sense. The food was over cooked I asked for rare and got medium, the porterhouse was a t-bone (the bottom end was missing) I don't recommend the Ranch House unless you make reservations under a name like Pierce, Bradley or Masson. Just a suggestion. A good restaurant would be consistant to include customer service and food. The server was supurb, he deserves 5 stars.",

    "text": "If you're looking for Old-School Vegas, look no further than Bob Taylor's Ranch House. This restaurant is literally an old ranch house, situated smack-dab in the middle of a tile-and-stucco northside neighborhood. But once you pull onto the gravel driveway and see the wagon wheel in the yard, you know you're driving up for a taste of the past.  My husband and I went last night to celebrate our anniversary. We've been to Bob Taylor's a few times, and we've always been seated in the large main dining room. This time, we were placed in the back. Not a bad thing, but the dusty industrial-style venetian blinds left a little to be desired.  The spouse had the ribeye, and I had the dinner special: a filet topped with a portobello mushroom and Bearnaise sauce. Both were smoky, moist, and cooked to perfection (his rare, mine medium rare). For sides, he had a salad with blue cheese dressing (basically ranch with cheese crumbles in it) and a twice-baked potato. I had the lobster bisque (yummy) and the cheesy ranch-house potatoes (even yummier!).  Prices are comparable to other steakhouses in town ($27 and $36), but some of those places make you pay extra for your sides, so these rates are pretty reasonable. Even more reasonable are the prices on wine; we had two bottles of pinot noir for the price of one bottle at most Strip restaurants ($27 a pop).  Service was a little slow, although our waitress was pleasant and accommodating. And I can't give a five-star rating to a place with dirty window coverings at eye level. But overall, we enjoyed our dinner and I'm sure we'll be back.  I miss the days of the Green Shack and the Hilltop House, but if the crowds this Saturday night are any indication, the Ranch House will remain to keep Old Vegas alive well into this century.",

However, the more I thought about it the more I thought people should know it's not all it is cracked up to be.   Having heard great things about Bob Taylor's Steakhouse I made a reservation to eat there on Christmas Day.  What a disappointment.  We had a party of five people and were escorted to a booth, which I had requested if possible when I made the reservation.  The booth was small and we were most uncomfortable since we are fairly large people.  There was a much larger booth next door to ours with just one child sitting in it.  The rest of the child's family were sitting at tables which appeared to have been added, also not full.  I can't say what those circumstances were.  Perhaps they had guests earlier that had left.  It just seemed like far too much space for one child.   After we were seated it took an awful long time for the waitress to come and take our order for drinks.  She took our food order at the same time.  They didn't have any decent beer which my son likes to drink so other than water he had nothing special to drink.  It took what seemed like forever for our food to be served.  I ordered a tenderloin steak, medium cooked, costing about $28.00.  It was way over cooked, almost well done.  One of our party ordered lobster.  She said it was so dry she could not eat it.  Fortunately, my son and his wife said their food was satisfactory, which I was happy about since I was treating them as a Christmas gift.  The other person in our party said his food was OK.  We told the waitress how unhappy we were with the food and she asked did we want to send it back but since we didn't want to wait another hour or more we cut our losses and took the food home to use for sandwiches rather than waste it altogether.  Neither of us intend going back there ever again.  It is expensive and obviously the Chef does not know how to cook steak or lobster and the waiting time for our food to come to the table was totally unacceptable.",

    "text": "I was taken here recently and this is yet another situation where Yelp really needs half star ratings. I am siding on the five stars for this place is a diamond in the rough. I can't say too many good things about the staff, it is old school True customer service.   We had a had the bone in ribeye steak, ribs with lobster bisque, stuffed mushrooms and a couple of glasses of wine. We shared some of all parts of our meal between us.   The stuffed mushrooms were great, nice and juicy.   The lobster bisque, it was amazing fresh with a large amount of lobster in it.   The steak was juicy, flavorful, and cooked to a perfect medium rare.   The ribs were also excellent, not a True BBQ joint rib but they are just right from a country cooking steak house.",

Then I had the filet which was the special bacon wrapped I can't tell you the last time I had a steak this good. My sister had the twin lobster tails which she said were very tasty and my dad had the porterhouse which in his words was mouthwatering. All in all I highly recommend if you've never been its definitely a Vegas classic. Bravo to the chef and waitress who made our experience even better! I see why it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas standing the test of time.",

    "text": "I would give this restaurant ZERO stars if I could. This used to be a hidden gem that we loved dining at. The last 3 times, they have not cooked the filet mignon to my preference. Each time I have asked for the the filet to be butterflied, and cooked medium  well. Each time, a non-butterflied medium rare filet was prepared.  Tonight the waitress made an excuse that this is how they butterfly meat, and that the chef does not like to cut against the grain. I asked for my filet to be butterflied, and as the paying customer requested the food be cooked to my order. She took the steak back.  My husband asked to speak with the manager and the waitress told us the chef grilling the meat is the manager because he is the most senior employee present.  When my husband went to speak with him, the chef grilling the meat said that the filet was butterflied. It clearly was not, and he called my husband a liar for saying it was not butterflied.  I have successfully ordered filet mignon, butterflied and cooked medium well in restaurants across the country. This is the only restaurant that has refused to prepare my filet how I order it, and calls the customer a liar when they send it back.  3 strikes, you're out Bob Taylor's Ranch House. There are plenty of restaurants in Las Vegas who will gladly prepare my filet mignon, butterflied and medium well.",

She called my friend back saying it was fine and she was all set for 730pm. When we arrived at 630 to sit at the bar we checked in and the manager said very rudely it was at 7 and argued with my friend.  Still wanting to give them a fair chance we attempted to eat there.  It took over two and a half hours and it was far less than satisfactory. First they did not have any soup even though it was offered with every dinner on the menu.  The salads were drowned in dressing,  they were not gluten free or dairy free friendly. Twenty minutes after ordering the waitress came out to tell us they were \"so busy\" that they ran out of prime rib (a main dish being offered) said the rib eye was the same cut and they would be substituting that cut.  When we were finally served, it was gross.  Potatoes were burnt and the \"medium\" temperature steak was more over cooked than jerky. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "We went to Bob Taylor's for the umpteenth time last nite.  It's close to our house and when we crave big beef, it's our first choice.  I always have the smoked prime rib, the only thing I really enjoy there (however, I have never had the lamb, so maybe next time!)  I have had both the twice baked and the regular baked potatoes, and they are both good.  I love their cheese bread that starts the meal, and I have never had appetizers mainly because the main course is usually more than enough for dinner.  I have found their creamed soups to be akin to library paste, so mostly always get the salad, which is pretty non-descript but adequate.    I usually get the 12-oz prime rib, medium, and can never finish it,  and the smoked flavor is mild, but adds so much to the meat.    For the first time ast night we had the all you can eat ribs for $15.99 (every Tuesday), and the ribs were very tender but had an odd herb either in the BBQ sauce or the rib marinade which I think was rosemary, but it didn't appeal to me at all.  My husband liked them, but neither of us could finish the first serving which was very generous, so that was all we could eat.  They also have a nice wine selection and what I think are very reasonable prices compared to so many of the restaurants which have 150-200% markups on wine.  Service is always good there, very attentive and friendly, and I am so glad they DO NOT have TVs with sports shows on in the restaurant.!!!!",

    "text": "This place was a recommendation from a casino bartender who said the food was great and priced right.  We love to get tips as to hidden gems when we travel, and based on the reviews, we thought it was going to be much better than it was.  We may have arrived on an off-night, because what we found did not meet what had been described.    It's a bit of a distance from The Strip, which was not a problem.  It's great to be away from the hustle and bustle of the gambling crowd.  I had the smoked chicken, my partner a sirloin steak.  She asked about the twice baked potato and was told that they add bacon to the mix before it is baked.  Sorry, but bacon isn't for everyone, and she was glad that she asked.  My chicken was served with no sauce and with rice pilaf.  She had the homemade chicken noodle soup, I opted for the homemade thousand island dressing with my salad.  The smoked chicken was way too dry, having probably spent time in a warming oven before being served.  Advertised as 'smoked' there was zero smoke flavor.  The steak was not cooked to the way she ordered and had to be put back on the grill.  Well, what happens to a piece of meat that has been cut open after it has had a chance to rest to allow the juices to gather back into the center when it gets placed back on the grill?  Yep, say goodbye to the juice and hello to shoe leather.  She had to dab butter on the steak to moisten it.  We later joked about which one of us had used more butter on our entree in an attempt to add moisture.  Service was a five(!!!), with the server being very attentive and friendly.  Food was a two, with the best part of the meal being the garlic cheese bread, the soup and salad.  There were multiple birthday / anniversary celebrations going on in the place, so either they got the five star food with us getting the leftovers, (and a tired cook) or this place is more about having fun with a group while everyone secretly wishes the food was better than it is.",

In fact we always let our out of town visitors know that they really need to eat there before they leave Las Vegas for a True old Vegas experience.  I don't know how many times the restaurant has changed hands but this past weekend was the worst experience ever. Our rib appetizer was lukewarm at best and the BBQ sauce was cold. The salad was inedible. The lettuce looked like it was the pre-packaged cheap stuff and had the smell and taste of MSG preservatives. The lettuce was soggy and the blue cheese dressing was watery and very runny.  The baked potato that came with our steaks tasted overcooked and burnt. It had that black skin around the inside that you get from reheating old baked potatoes. We told our waitress about it and she brought us out 2 more baked potatoes that were just as bad. When we let her know again she said that fresh potatoes would not be ready for another 15 minutes.  Although the steaks we had were very good the side dishes were so very bad that it brought down the whole meal experience. It was truly very disappointing. We will no longer refer people to Bob Taylors and after reading some of the other reviews on Yelp it seems a lot of people have had the same experience so this was not a one bad night fluke kind of thing. They seem not to care what the reviews say as it's obvious they have not made any attempt to improve the things that everyone is complaining about. There are better places for me to spend my hard earned money than Bob Taylors.",

Ranch House was a close drive from our place- convenience is a plus so we can drive them up and take them back down to the airport. Thought it would be cool to experience a lil old Vegas too. I think it was the right place just because its quiet and everyone can talk specially my family and my BFs family were meeting for the first time.   Ordered sauteed livers and some wings to munch on. Livers were yummy- not overcooked and the wings were alright, a little salty for me.   Salad is pretty standard side salad you'd get someplace like Carrows or iHop of the iceburg variety with some shred carrot and bit of red cabbage. I didnt eat too much of it and not really memorable.  Split a porterhouse with my BF. Most people got bone in ribeye or ribeye. I of course took a bite out of everyones. Our porterhouse was nice- good cut of meat and cooked med.rare, the bone in ribeyes were juicy, the small thin ribeye was alright. The ranch pototatoes were good, but I was focused on eating the meat and we had plenty of leftovers for happy animals and sandwiches the next day.  Service was friendly, a little slow considering were the only ones there, but not bad.   Overall it was a pretty good place to take family for a quiet meal, though maybe not my mom. She's an ambiance person and illusioned away by the grand spots of the strip and wanted a \"fancy\" place to take my BF's mom to impress her....Meh, yeah- thats back on the strip which we didnt have time for. Good for people who like nostalgia, kitch and steak....I see myself bringing grandpa here to tell me about all the posters on the wall. I think though for offstrip steak I much prefer Austins steakhouse though, but this place isn't bad.   I will come back and try their lunch items though- some of the sandwiches sound good and are priced just right at $7-8....I  thought I saw a all you can eat rib night and prime rib night so I'll definitely consider coming for that.",

All joking aside, Bob Taylor's Ranch House has been in business since 1955 so they must be doing something right. Right? Beano Fatardo investigates.  First of all, you will get cancer the second you walk into Bob Taylor's. Even with just a few customers, the place reeked of everyone's favorite combination : stale cigarettes and fresh cigarettes. On top of that, the place was dark, dingy, and depressing. I felt like I was in an old bowling alley. The only difference is that old bowling alleys serve somewhat edible food.  Not only was my hamburger a once frozen patty, the steak fries had less flavor than water. I would have loved to try the coleslaw instead of the fries, but it wasn't prepared yet! Why do I have a feeling the cook is on a morning-long smoke break..... inside the restaurant!?  The only reason I am not giving Bob Taylor's a single star is because the bacon on my burger was nice and thick. That has to account for something, right? In the end, Bob Taylor's Ranch House isn't even good enough for Pittsburgh Steeler fans. And I hear they eat old pee-soaked newspapers.",

    "text": "We had some meat and potato loving family members come into town and Bob Taylor's was an easy choice for dinner, based on previous visits. They had a hard time accomodating a party of seven and seated us at two round tables put together in the lounge area. I kind of found myself sitting in between the tables, but we made it work. There were plenty of TV's around to watch college hoops, so the seating arrangements weren't too bad. We were greeted by one waitress and then she was gone and replaced by another. I'm not sure what happened, but they did start to get real busy and may have had to shift some staff around. I understand good food takes time, but the service was slow and the waitress seemed a little overwhelmed when it came to refilling drinks and bringing out the salads and soup. The food was good, as it always has been, but not great. I highly recommend the Ranch House as your choice of potato. Some of  our party ordered the Lobster Bisque and said it was full of flavor. My Rib Eye was tasty, but three in our party got sirloin and all ordered it the same way, with different results. One was perfect, one was under cooked and the other was over cooked. All of the entrees come with the garlic cheese bread, which is a nice touch. One of the least expensive options on the menu is the Barbeque Beef Tips and they were actually better the the sirloin. Our party of seven got out for less than $200, including tip, but one in our group opted to have only soup and salad.",

    "text": "I'm glad we read reviews first, it really is out in the middle of nowhere. I'll get the stuff we didn't like out of the way first. The drinks were watered down, the steaks not cooked as we ordered, and the steaks were a bit chewy, they aren't the best cuts of meat. That said, why are we fans? Because it's the kind of the place that you know your parents would have gone to, the service is pleasant and quick, the rest of the food is good, and it feels like a time gone by, slow and unpretentious and relaxed.   We liked the Texas toast, and they offered to give us more, but one is enough. I had the ranch potatoes, and they tasted like mac and cheese, they were so delicious. The salads are forgettable, you may want to pass. The chicken liver appetizer was super, really tasty and well cooked. I had the smoked prime rib; skip it. Go for a steak instead. Husband had a steak and was much happier with his dinner, although there was a lot of gristle. We skipped dessert. The service was spot on through the entire dinner. It's a bit chilly in the winter, I sat next to the fire and was still cold.   Is it the best food ever? No. But we paid less than 100 bucks for dinner for two, with an appetizer and drinks, and that's a pretty good deal for what you get. This is the place you take your parents, a big group of friends, or when you have been married so long the romance is dead and you just want to eat, not share a moment with your meal.  Extra kudos for the western decor. It feels like home, if I were still living in Bakersfield.",

I live too far to make this my regular steakhouse but the foods that I have tried have been stellar. I usually split the grilled pork chops with my dad. Plump, juicy, and a whole lotta meat/food for only one person. Love the potatoes that accompany the chops. Oh, each burger I've had here has been good too. They make em like I love em; medium rare, lots of red onions, and a side of mayo. Of course other bar type snacks during game time are offerred, sandwiches, chili cheese fries, wings, nachos.",

Really, really good food.  Exceptionally friendly and meaningful service.    Had the NY Strip with Ranch House Potatoes.  Perfection on a plate.  Only giving 4 stars because 5 stars, to me, should only be given to best-in-class establishments.

This was a party of three we had to go and find a waitress, my wife ate and my sister ate, I had lost my appatite and drank water.  The food was fair at best as they were busy and the service was terrible.  Your resturant lost $200.00 easyily, because of the attitude of the Bar Tender and the poor table service.  And of course I shall bad mouth The Ranch House and never return.  There is way to much competition out there for me to be treated like this.  Good Luck Ranch House.",

We returned, they came back charcoaled very crispy on the outside. Everyone at our table finished their meal before we got our food back. Our potatoes were cold because they left them sitting on plate while they cremated the 2 steaks. The dinners were $30 each so I feel like I should have gotten my dinner cooked the proper way and eat dinner with my family. The server continued to tell me they had a party of 25 , made me feel like we were not important. They had to take care of the party of 25. We are locals and we go there quite a bit. I called there to speak with a manager and she never did even introduce herself , never said she was sorry this happen, just said if you are ever here and I'm here, I'll see what I can do. Well I don't expect anything, but should have at least got an apology from manager. I just told her to have a great day!!! Will not be going back there",

If I'm paying ur drink prices there better be some alcohol in there first of all and second she shouldn't be a bartender.

We were promptly seated at our reservation time in a dining room filled with tv's showing NFL football. The room was almost full at six pm which surprised me. Our server, Anatoli was great. He was helpful and personable. He offered his favorites and customers favorites. I took his advice and had the porterhouse. My friend had the prime rib which was their special for $1 per ounce. Our salads were nothing special but tasty. The cheese bread was also yummy. The star of the show is their steaks and they didn't disappoint. My porterhouse was cooked to perfection. Great smoked flavor, nice char and perfect pink in the center. No need for steak sauce on this puppy. So good! My friends prime rib was excellent.  Hardly any fat and perfectly cooked. Again delicious. The baked potato was big and meaty. The side of veggies were also yummy. We shared the carrot cake which was a disappointment. It was a 5 layer cake that was rather hard and dry. Overall we enjoyed our dinners and would recommend Bob Taylors for anyone looking for a great steak in a quaint restaurant away from a casino.",

Except now that I think of it, we did not get the cheese garlic bread that we were supposed to... Hmmm  Calamari was very average and priced accordingly.  Porterhouse was very good as was my wife's lamb.  My prime rib was very good overall.  Not too smokey as some reviews had indicated.  Son's scallop fettuccine  was very large and tasty.    Overall we enjoyed our meals and skipped desert so we were paid and out in 65 min.  Total for 4 people (no drinks and 1 app) came in at 147.00 plus tip.

Every meal comes with choice of salad or soup and a choice of potato, including twice baked and ranch house.  You must try the ranch house potatoes which are hash browns mixed with creamy cheese and mushrooms then baked. Try and leave room for dessert.   The feel of this restaurant is an old style ranch house.",

They have daily specials, and luckily for us, we ended up going on the all you can eat ribs night for $15. The ribs were delicious.The meat fell right off the bone, had a great amount of delicious BBQ sauce, and the plate came with a side as well. I just got fries. My hubby had a prime rib streak that just melted in your mouth. Boy that was good too.  As part of your meal, before the entree, you also get soup or salad and both come with garlic cheese bread.The soup was wonderful, you can really tell it was home made. We really didn't care for the bread too much.  The waiter was mighty pleasant, wonderful personality I was pretty satisfied. I'll definitely be coming back for more",

We were told by some friends to come here and since it wasn't too far we thought we'd check it out.  This is an old school Vegas cowboy steakhouse.  Nothing fancy just an old ranch house turned restaurant.  Lots of locals.  Good food and good service. It's down home cookin'  and the chef is within viewing distance of your table-you could even wave to him!   We had the lobster and filet mignon, the scallops were okay just too small and too much greasy butter, should have had a steak-duh I'm at a steakhouse not a seafood restaurant.  Bread basket was yummy (Texas toast), ice-burg lettuce salad with some homestyle dressing was good and I had a mini screw cap bottle of champagne-which was cold bubbly and perfect (just like a room service bottle).  Great kids menu too. A little pricey for the total value.",

We long for a neighborhood-y hang we can call our own. I keep hearing and reading rave reviews for this place that is an oh so convenient five minutes from our house. Not sure what I'm missing.   This was our second visit, the first was almost four years ago. It was such an underwhelming event that it took us this long to get it together to try again.   Our expectations were appropriately lowered, but still hopeful. Loved the old west funk, and that we were greeted warmly and quickly upon arrival (a Tuesday evening/no reservation). Our server was friendly and helpful. I ordered a martini, which he brought quickly, always a good thing. Not so exciting was how small it was. Not much more irritating than a pediatric sized martini. I mean where are we, Utah??? On the upside, it might have been the best one I've ever had.   Then came the Texas Toast. I'll admit it, I'm a total bread snob. I try not to eat bread very often so when I do, it better be off the hook good. This was warm, and cheesy/garlicky, but also kinda wet and limp. I took one bite and called the game.   A salad comes with every entree, a nice touch. Theirs is real old school with iceberg lettuce, the odd, not so ripe grape tomato, and stale packaged croutons.  Mine had ranch dressing, which was heavily applied, but tasty.   We decided to keep things simple with our entrees. The hubs went in for the ribeye, and I got the prime rib. We're not afraid to spend money when we dine out, but I'm really not feeling either of our meals being worth the $26 we paid for them. The ribeye was painfully thin, over cooked, and very salty; my prime rib was cooked as I requested, but was served barely room temperature. Like, cold. My baked potato however, was mega-hot and generously loaded with butter and sour cream. The hubs reported being very satisfied with his twice baked potato.   The meat portions were large and we had plenty to take home for sandwiches.   In short, good to great service, very average food, and prices significantly higher than I'd expect to pay for the privilege of dining there. I guess the search continues....",

The restaurant is located in north Vegas  close enough to where our family live in this part of Las Vegas.  Passing the ranch entrance, the restaurant is in an old building which is packed with artifacts and farm tools of the old west days and the feel of western nostalgia.  Grilled cheese garlic bread was served, and it was out of this world with our meal we got to choose either soup or salad which were nicely prepared.  My 12 oz rib eye steak was cooked right to medium rare, well seasoned and juicy tender. Baked potato with sour cream and also broccoli came with the dish.  Other orders of the table included fettuccine with scallops, and full rack of baby back ribs. All dishes were delicious and  prepared beautifully. Service was standard and friendly. If other visitors to Las Vegas are looking for a restaurant with legacy and good food, I would recommend Bob Taylor's Ranch House to be included in their bucket list strongly.",

The typical bread is good, even if greasy. It's cheese toast, and, while not calorie free, it can easily fill you up before dinner.   The menu is extensive, with great choices from filets to rack of lamb to scallops. My table had a New York strip (delicious), a none in ribeye (looked amazing), and scallops (she didn't share).

After nearly 12 years living in Vegas, I finally made the trek for dinner with my guy and his co-workers.   Located in the middle of nowhere, this isn't a spot that you would just come across on your way somewhere else. The restaurant is located in a ranch as the name suggest and is somewhat of an institution since it has been around for so long.   They have kept the vintage vibe alive and well there. The service was ok, attentive at times but needed a nudge from time to time for refills and such. We started with a few appetizers that were not particularly memorable and their cheesy garlic bread which was one of the highlights for me. I decide on the prime rib since I had heard was one of the better selections. It was good, although nothing amazing.   Each couple ordered a dessert to share as well. Our key lime pie was standard, yet tasty. The cheesecakes our dining companions ordered were not as well received.   For the price, it's not bad and I've heard their lunch is good as well so I might be interested in trying that some time. Otherwise, I'm happy I tried this spot but it might be one and done for me.",

I'm with a dinner party and often refuse to be that guy that has to have his food returned and then all have to wait.  When the waiter asked, \"how is everything\"? I said, my medium rare steak is burned and well done.  He didn't even bat an eye.  Later, he asked me, \"are you done with your plate\"? I said \"Yes, because that whole half is burned\". Again, he just ignored me.  I was disappointed, and it's unfortunate because it's a cool little spot.  We won't be returning to that location, especially with those expensive prices for low quality service and food.",

Well now that Vegas has expanded, I live my adult life fairly close to Bob Taylor's. And my husband took me there on a date recently and I was NOT disappointed. We went a little early in the day so the prime rib wasn't ready yet, but the pork chop was perfect and the ribeye was amazing and the chicken wings were crispy and flavorful. They make an awesome old fashion and are one of the only supper clubs that I know of in town.   The service is great, attentive friendly staff, we were taken care of from the moment we arrived. We will definitely go back and make our way through the menu!",

I've never heard of that but I took his advice and went out there for a fabulous date.    Keep in mind that at this time in 1993 this restaurant was way out of Vegas on the outskirts of town and we came, ate and really enjoyed our time.    I've been coming routinely ever since and now it's not on the outskirts of town.  It's in the heart of Aliante/N Las Vegas.  This place has stayed the same though.  Old school vibe, with amazing service and food.  The ambiance here is great too.    I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and seen many people who are either native to Vegas, new here or just visiting and have never heard a bad thing about this place.    With so much competition in Vegas and so many fine dining restaurants coming and going it's easy to see why Bob Taylor's has stood the test of time.    If you want a great meal, or just a couple drinks at the bar then go check this out.  You won't be disappointed.",

She then later wiped the tablecloth off because she said the mess was bothering her.  I don't fault her, just a bit awkward.   All in all, quite a large portion of food, we would likely return.",

We asked for A1 sauce yo dip our steaks in (I know insult to the chef) but I actually didn't even use it. The Filet was flavored and cooked perfectly. Even the BF was a little jelly he didn't get the Filet. He did use sparingly for his porterhouse and mixed it up with the house taters. Good little combo he had going on.   Our Server was excellent, sweet and came around when needed to bring us our refreshments. I believe her name was Katherine, or Katelyn ... We'll call her Kat! Lol   Dessert was delicious as well.

Just when you thought that you are definitely and hopelessly lost you see the Ann Rd. exit from 95 North and say whew, almost there.  It's about 20 minutes from the Strip and the drive was definitely worth it.  For steak lovers, this is the place to go in Vegas.  I had the ribeye 12 oz. for $28, and this came with your choice of soup of the day or garden salad.  Silly me, I chose the salad to try to save a \"few\" calories.  Should've chosen the clam chowder instead!  The potato side dish was excellent.  They offer a couple of varieties - twice-baked potato (which is a mashed potato baked twice with the toppings), a baked potato, and the ranch house potatoes.  I had the ranch house potatoes and that was great, but in all honesty I couldn't even finish it cause I was trying to eat the massive piece of meat before me!  The steak was seasoned perfectly, and crusted just the way I like it.  Very moist and juicy, and tender.  The best steak that I have had, period.  Last, but not least, is the Texas Toast.  One word - fantastic.  I could've just eaten the toast all night and still rate this place 5 stars!  It was that good.",

My wife had a salad which she enjoyed and I had the lobster  bisque.  Both the salad and the  bisque were  very good.  For our entrees the wife had filet and crab legs and I ordered the porterhouse and lobster tail.   Well here is where the stars started dropping off.   We both ordered our meat medium.  ***Note on the menu there is a section that specifically points out levels of doneness for steak orders***   Again I state we ordered our steaks MEDIUM.  My wife's filet came well done and my porterhouse was rare.  Additionally my lobster tail was also over cooked.  Both of these plates were around $50.00, this is a steakhouse they should know how to cook a steak medium.  They got all the sides and accompaniments right but they messed up on the steaks and the lobster.  Both my wife and I did not finish our steaks.  When the waitress came back I had advised her that my wife's filet was cooked wrong and so was mine. She apologized and offered us a free dessert.  She also offered to take the meat back and have it  cooked properly.  Well we refused those things.  I never send food back!!!  I should get it right the first time and I really don't think that a free dessert will make up for an overcooked filet or an undercooked porterhouse, plus the over cooked lobster tail.  A $5.00 dessert does not make things right.  Here's the thing. The place is a steakhouse and they do steak  day after day after day.  If we ordered our meat medium it should come medium.  This was our first visit here and we had heard it was a very good steakhouse.  I had planned on brining my whole family of 6 next weekend,  but after tonight I think I'll take them somewhere else.  Lesson learned.  We will not dine here again",

Not bad just a bit residential/farm (hmm, maybe why it's a Ranch House) than you'd expect for a restaurant. I just moved to the area and have been seeing the signs pointing the way to the Ranch and finally decided to give it a whirl. One note. Yelp shows that they are only open for dinner but they are open for lunch. You can order from the lunch menu or dinner menu. I opted for the 8 oz filet mignon off the dinner menu with the double baked potato. Excellent steak with a great mesquite flavor.  The lunch menu does have some great sandwich choices that I'll definitely be going back to try. They run a prime rib by the ounce deal on Monday that looked like a bargain but we were there a bit early for that. Our waitress (Liz S) was wonderful. Had some suggestions for the sandwiches on the lunch menu and was did a superb job keeping me hydrated with quick water refills.  This restaurant has been here since 1955. Give them a try you won't be sorry.",

Now I won't go as far to say that Bob Taylor's has the best steak, in my opinion you have to go to Chicago for that, but I will say say this place has very good food while keeping the pocket book in mind.

The ribs didn't even look like they had much meat on them.  One slab was too much for me to deal with.   My wife sent back her first slab, thinking she would get a better one.

    "text": "I don't think it can quite be categorized as a staple, but Bob Taylor's definitely has it's history in Las Vegas. Being born and raised here, I've been coming to the Ranch House for as far back as I remember. When I was younger, this was one my mom and stepdads favorite places to go for a steak. I remember when there used to be long waits and lines out the door. But I can't remember when exactly I was here last, I just know it's been a good 15+ years.  A few of our friends recently invited us here for dinner when they were craving some \"good ole' American meat\". When the 5 of us walked in on a Saturday night, there was absolutely no wait. There was a few tables sat inside, and while the decor has remained mostly unchanged from what I remember, the place just doesn't seem to have that Ranch House feel anymore. It's definitely starting to show it's age, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it almost feels more like a chain restaurant now than a mini-getaway from the city like it used too.  After browsing the menu for a bit, I decided on a special that there were advertising, a bacon-wrapped 8oz filet, I believe priced at about $35. Much like the regular menu items, it came with a soup or salad, and a potato choice. I chose the lobster bisque, which wasn't great, but according to other reviewers, was likely a lot better than their side salad. It just didn't really have much flavor, and there was no lobster in it. The best part about it was dipping their garlic cheese toast in it, which on it's own wasn't anything special either.   Now, I'm the type of person who doesn't believe in eating a steak at anything past medium rare...and with no shame, I'll give you a hard time about doing so. But I think when I ordered my filet medium rare, and just about everyone else at the table ordered there's well done, it threw the kitchen off a little bit. All 4 of our steaks were just off a bit. Mine was cooked much closer to medium, and the well done orders were more like medium rare. Not that I feel too bad for them, since they won't be able to taste anything way, it's always disappointing when your steak isn't done right. Especially mine being over medium rare.   Even though I still think the Ranch House uses fairly good quality meat, especially at the price, their execution just isn't there. Alongside the temperature issues, our steaks came with a bearnaise sauce that pretty much ruined the whole thing. It was easily the thickest bearnaise sauce I've ever seen, and had a texture that was more like a dry paste squeezed out of a pastry bag. There was no smoothness to it, it wasn't creamy, and it really didn't taste all that good. Scraping as much of it off as I could helped a bit, but this would have been an entirely different experience if that sauce wasn't there to begin with.   There service doesn't have much behind it either. We felt really rushed with our orders, and it took a while to get drink refills too. Our waitress was okay, but she wasn't very friendly, and didn't seem all that interested in waiting tables anymore that night.   Maybe nostalgia kicks in a little on this 3 star review, just because I like the place and have been here so many times before as a kid. And as I mentioned, I still don't think their prices are too crazy high for the quality of meat. But the service and kitchen execution resemble more of an Outback or other chain. I might go back eventually, but if it's anything like this last visit, and they've completely lost that homey, local feel with decent steaks to go along with it, the Ranch House would be all but a memory.",

While we ate our soup and salad, the anticipation for the ribs were unbearable! The open flame grill and the aroma of meat in the air made it difficult to concentrate on what my husband was talking about. The ribs fell off the bone. The meat to bbq sauce ratio was perfect too (if you're not into too much sauce)!  All this food and 4 glasses of beer cost us $49. SCORE!!

    "text": "This is one of the last, honest steakhouses left for locals in Vegas. It's not fancy or pretentious, just a nice place for a great steak! There is a tremendous value in a steak menu price that includes the soup/salad, sides and cheese bread (grilled moments before it's on your table!). The meat is cooked expertly over an open wood flame and served to your specification (from rare to eight grades up to well done). Our table ordered three different temperatures and each of us was delighted with the pink! Appetizers are somewhat limited but really well presented. The salads are simple but fresh and the clam chowder is delicious. The steaks themselves are beautifully cooked and so tender, the eyes roll  back the minute the meat goes in your mouth. Baked potatoes are big and loaded and the steak fries are perfect! Desert is standard multi layer restaurant fare ( leading me to believe they are not prepared on site) but really after eating the meat, dessert is not a priority. Wine list is just adequate, but reasonably priced. The environment is rustic and the bathrooms really need to be upgraded but since the place has been open since 1955 I imagine they are limited as to how they can configure the existing space. Service is adequate and comfortable, and don't hesitate to offer the much needed to-go boxes. I have been going there for close to thirty years and can heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a great steak dinner at an exceptional value.",

Finally the shrimp cocktail \"appetizer\" came out and it was really sad.. 3 pieces of shrimp. Finally our order from the bar came and we asked for a glass, but we never saw our server again until our meals came, but we never got our soups or salads just our dinner. She had obviously forgotten and was really surprised about it and asked if we wanted them now - after our food had already come, nope. No thanks. Husband ordered another drink from the bar when our food arrived and it didn't get there until we were done with dinner. I thought that maybe we'd get dessert or something off the bill for forgetting 5 soups/salads but no, nothing. Guess we should've taken them with our meal :) Paid in cash because we didn't want to wait around for our server any more.  3 stars because the food that did make it to us was great, but the lack of service makes this a place we probably won't revisit.",

Honestly, if the restaurant was consistent then I would of given it 3.5/4 stars. We ordered four different cuts of meat for dinner. The entrees come with a salad or soup, garlic cheesy bread,  and a side. The ranch was great, and the salad was a normal house salad. The lobster bisque, and cheesy bread was surprisingly delightful.   Then came the steak. The steak is the grand resistance to any meal. So, we waited for about 20 minutes to receive our steak after we ate our starters. Mind you, it was extremely busy, and it seemed like the staff didn't have enough space, to work with in the kitchen.   Finally, our steaks come, and everything looks delicious. I ordered a porterhouse, which was gigantic and has good flavored but was not medium as I ordered it. I sent it back, and received my new steak after 20 minutes, and everyone was already finished with their meal. My new steak was borderline rare, which I didn't mind. However, the chefs consistency was lacking. Everyone else said their steak was alright.   I would be willing to try the restaurant again, when it isn't so busy to see if their consistency is better.",

Most of the places I like to go are like Bob Taylor's Ranch House, old school stick to what you know kinda place.  This place is no exception.  Since 1955, BT Ranch House has been serving steaks primarily along with chicken and seafood, smoked over mesquite wood (it says so on their sign)  After many years of living here it was time for me and my buddy to check it out to top off my birthday week.   It's old school and nothing fancy and for that it gets 4 stars but after that the food, value and old school feel is what has kept it just that an old school cowboy haunt of Las Vegas.  All the meals are served with soup or salad a potato (baked, twice baked or a Bob Taylor's Ranch House specialty potato, totally recommend the later), rice pilaf or mixed veggies.   We both ordered the filet one 8oz and one 12oz, baked potato for my friend and the specialty potato for me. Salad to start with basic dressings as well.   See photos for all of the above. The taste was spot on and bottom line you can't go wrong with a mesquite fired steak. Top that off with a 5 layer chocolate birthday cake slice and you'll be set.",

The walk up to the entrance was very inviting and I love the open grass area and the trees and plants around it. Now onto the decor and how it is set up; extremely has a fun yet mellow vibe to it and has a homey touch to it as well but elegant which is nice.  Customer service is on point the moment you walk in the door to the very last minute walking out. Our server was amazing I forgot his name but he was awesome from the moment to ordering our drinks to bringing us the check.  The quality of the food was outstanding couldnt ask for anything better.  I was actually skeptical about trying the ranch house potatoes but our server gave me a very convincing reason and explanation on why I should try them, I hate mushrooms and never liked but I DIDNT EVEN TASTE THEM!!!! ITS LIKE THEY WERENT EVEN THERE!!! Needless to say my experience here was amazing and they have gained a continous customer along with many recommendations to my friends family anyone!!!!",

With that said, don't let the simple surroundings fool you, because what comes out of the kitchen is top notch!   We had the ribeye and our kids had the New York strip steak and the kids Fettuccine. Just because it's a kids pastor doesn't mean that it's small. Great presentation and delicious food. If you like blue cheese make sure you get the salad because it has the perfect amount. The surroundings in the restaurant bar of the old cowboy seen of the 50's and 60's silver screen. The restaurants outside and inside are clean and well kept. Point to note, if you have a favorite wine, bring it! It's a $9 corking fee but they are cool with you bring your own wine. Our steaks were cooked exactly to what we ordered. And I would have had a picture, but we devoured them.... Oh well there is always next time.   Great service and great food. Thank you!",

    "text": "We had a nice dinner here.  I think this restaurant is more about the ambiance than anything else,  it's really a throwback kind of place.  Mark H, being a Vegas native, talked about how this place was way far out of the city and there was nothing built up around it, just this restaurant.  He said going to a supper club outside of town like this was always an event.  Nowadays, it's in the middle of a neighborhood but the restaurant still has that supper club charm with its rustic, dark wood interior and friendly and outgoing servers.  Between the four of us, we ordered a couple of appetizers, spicy wings and crab stuffed mushrooms.  The wings were good, hot and tender and just spicy enough.  I couldn't eat the mushrooms because of the crab but others said they were also good.  For dinner, there were two filets and two ribeyes ordered.  My ribeye came out mid-rare like I'd ordered,  the other was a bit over mid-rare unfortunately.  Flavor-wise the ribeye was ok but it was a bit on the tough side.  The comments on the filets were that they were good.  For dessert we shared two pieces of key lime pie which were pretty good.  A bit too much on the sweet side instead of that perfect tart to sweet balance you want in a key lime pie.  It's the overall experience of this place that makes it I think and what keeps people coming back.  We went on a weeknight and it was packed, that's the proof right there.  3.5 stars but upped to 4 because you don't see too many places like this anymore.",

She didn't ask us about drinks, we had to ask her for them after she took our order. My husbands beer didn't come out until after we already had our salads. Our steaks were over cooked. She gave the tables next to us great service, we were checked on one time. She kept her communication short and not personable. As soon as we asked for boxes she handed the check but offered the other table dessert. Idk if it was bc we are younger or bc of my husbands race, no matter what.... we should have been treated the same. We can definitely find another steakhouse to spend our money.",

I'd say it's worth the trek from other areas of the city, at least once.   My favorite thing about Bob Taylor's is the vibe. Especially during the holidays, it's extra cozy. With the feeling of eating over in someone's dining room (with a bunch of strangers), the smell of the indoor grill, the twinkles lights that are hung outside year round, and the plethora of neighborhood cats that roam the adorable property. I could come here and just drink some wine and still enjoy myself fully.   I am not extremely impressed by the food itself. It's has a very home-cooked feel, which is what some people are looking for! I however just prefer a bit more modern approach when it comes to steakhouses. Personal preference I suppose. I do feel that on occasion my filet has been tough and a bit dry. But other times is has been perfectly cooked. So you don't really ever know what you'll get.   The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. You can tell that most of them love working there. And I am ALWAYS impressed by their dessert. Decadent, comforting gooey desserts. Definitely more along the lines of what I like when it comes to that part of the meal.   All in all, totally worth the trip. The history, the environment, the experience and for the most part, the food.",

YELP sent us here (I mean, why not?) on a search for steak houses off the strip. We began our dinner with two appetizers, Crab Cakes and Sauteed Chicken Livers. After tasting these, we began to get excited about the Prime Rib and Twice Baked Potato we just ordered. We chose a dinner salad, and it was delivered with the best garlic cheese bread ever. We were able to share the whole meal. Yes, it's off the beaten path, but I suggest you beat a new path to Bob's.",

I have tried it three times and I have moved on. The sides are simple but good. The pork chops are cooked with a vinegar sauce. I had it for the first time tonight and I fell in love. I am a huge vinegar fan so drench away! The lobster bisque is not traditional, it's more like cream of lobster bisque so I will stick with the salad. On the steaks, I would suggest the rib eye or New York.",

It is in a totally out of the way crazy location but worth it. This place is so old school, down and dirty Vegas. I new I would love it the minute we pulled into the driveway. It's just a cute old house.   We came early so there was pretty much nobody there. We sat in the bar area and our waitress was at the table in seconds. We ordered some beers and she brought them right back. We had a couple of questions about how some items were prepared and our waitress went to ask the chef. She was so sweet.   We ordered our meals- I got the crab legs, broccoli with a side salad and the bf got the NY strip with sauteed mushrooms and side salad. When the waitress brought our salads she said she left off the croutons because she figured we wouldn't want them since we weren't eating bread. That was so nice of her to do that.   The food came out in a reasonable time and the food was perfect. Crab legs were split and so delicious. The bf said the steak was one of the best he's had in a long time. He lived the mesquite flavor. He actually ate the whole thing. He never does that.   This was truly a great meal. I wish I would have stopped by earlier. But I plan to be a regular here. The Ranch House is worth the drive wherever you are.",

The server took the plate back to the manager and the manager said they will give us a free dessert.    We did not want a free dessert we are trying not to eat a bunch of sugar.   When the bill came they did not take the steak off the bill.  Didn't offer to make a new one.   They kept insisting we take the free desert.   Why would he want desert when he really didn't even get to eat his dinner.     The 36.99 dollar steak we paid for.  My hubby walked away hungry and we had to go to in & out burger to get him something to eat.    Very sad.",

Lobster bisque to next was a bowl of tasteless mush. Ordered the filet it was dry and luke warm at best. The baked potatoes had to be sent back as they were all cold. By the time they warmed them we were done with everything else. I think the waitress was so embarrased that she offered us one free desert ( a chocolate layer cake ) That tasted like a supermarket box cake. We have been wanting to try this place but will never go back again!  Update: 9/11/19 Beware! Dirty dining Darcy Spears KTNV reported this restaurant closed due to a cockroach infestation and many other violations such as dirty kitchen with built up grease and old meat that was brown!",

You drive through the gates and park in a dirt lot.  There's shrubbery blocking the view to a building you can catch slight glimpses of.  Come around the corner, there is a nicely tended garden with a plethora of flowers lining a path to an open spot with benches and a streetlamp.    You enter what seems to be someones home and are confronted with the smells of the past (well at least my past).  Old leather, dust, an older restaurant.  But it isn't off-putting, it's the smell of nostalgia.  There is also nostalgia for your eyes as there are pictures and posters and knick-knacks all around.   We wanted to walk around and check things out and our server told us we could sit wherever we wanted.  We opted for the bar and ordered a light lunch and cocktails.  The service was great.  Our server was just learning to be a bartender but she had a really good attitude about it.  She consistently checked up on us and was super friendly.    I just ordered a Cobb salad (I know... it's a steakhouse) but it was great.  Fresh veggies, really really good Ranch dressing and the grilled chicken was super flavorful and moist.  I love that you could taste it was fire grilled and I think that trying a steak from that grill would be excellent.",

I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the size of the steak. It did not look like it was 32oz. Maybe because it was a New York Strip because I have eaten 24oz prime ribs and rib eyes that seemed bigger. It was a good cooked steak though, medium the way I like it. They need to ante up on the sides though IMO. And yes, I did merkulate the whole steak with sides and got free tiramisu dessert which was very good. I would have to go back and try their other steaks to hopefully give them a 4 or 5 star.",

    "text": "Pulling up at the Ranch House at night for the first time can be a bit intimidating. It's all the way in the back of some neighborhood, so it was definitely an unexpected spot (especially with those flashy signs leading the way). Once my boyfriend and I pulled up, we knew this establishment has been here for a veeerry long time. This is a real Ranch, I wouldn't be surprised if they raised their own cattle to serve here. The restaurant is on the left side of the lot and it looks like a few more homes/buildings on the right side. I apologize if this description is inaccurate, this is more of a nighttime view of the Ranch House. I have no idea what it looks like during the day, but I'm sure the name of the restaurant describes it well...it looks like a Ranch...and it looks like a House. Ta da!   Now the interior of the restaurant looks like the place should be named Bar Lounge Steakhouse. There were giant flat screens scattered throughout the place, but they were only playing in the bar/lounge area and not in the restaurant (saving energy?). That was a bit disappointing to my boyfriend, but I don't care to stare at a moving screen while I am eating (even less if I'm really enjoying my food. screw the TV!).   We were seated by a friendly, sweet waitress who was very informative and helpful throughout the entire meal. We ordered calamari, the rack of lamb for me with Ranch House potatoes, and the prime rib and lobster for the mister with a twice baked potato.  Both of our entrees came with salads and garlic cheese bread. I will now try to switch my review into a more organized and easily read manner:  calamari: good. standard calamari, crispy but oily. appropriate serving size. salad: I got the house dressing and it was delicious. I cleaned my entire plate, and I don't even like eating my veggies. Bf got ranch dressing on his salad, and he didn't finish it...so I'd say it must have been ok.  prime rib and lobster: the lobster tail was HUGE!! It just looked so plump and juicy, I did not taste since I'm allergic to shellfish, but my bf seemed happy with it. He reported that the prime rib was good, but he also expressed his regret in not ordering a steak. rack of lamb: WOW. If you like lamb, you HAVE TO GET THIS. This is the best lamb I have ever had. The herb and dijon blend was PERFECT. I cannot describe this at all, each bite is an explosion and that is an understatement. Usually your first bite is always the best, and then the flavor experience starts winding down. Not with this baby; it's the first bite every single time! 9 perfectly seasoned and fire-grilled chops with meat so tender, I purposely tried using just my lips to pull it off the bone (heeeeY) and it just tore off with no resistance (I got this cooked to medium, btw). Juicy, flavorful, tender...YOU MUST TRY THIS.  potatoes: sounds like most people are a fan of the twice-baked potato. Bf polished it off his plate, so he must agree. I wish I ordered that, because I did not like my Ranch House potatoes. Basically it's wet hash browns with mushrooms, cheese, and onions in it. Not for me. Garlic toast: I didn't like it. Too chewy and thin for me (I like the thick, texas toast types) and neither cheesy nor garlic-y enough. My boyfriend liked it though.   *whew* okay, now that I'm done re-living how awesome my meal was...here's the overall conclusion: definitely try it. You must get lamb if you like it. Everything else is not bad, I think it's a preference thing because there were things I liked that my boyfriend did not and vice versa. Give it a try, the service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing. I'm definitely going back for the lamb.",

The place was old, dark and dingy with a western theme.  This place needs a Robert Irvin restaurant impossible make over and the frozen hamburger patty and steak fries were under seasoned and my almost meatless philly steak sandwich was also disappointing.  The only thing that was decent was the service.  We won't be coming back here.  Sorry Bob.",

My mother-in-law's was the same. The flavor was good but just overdone. My husband got the 22 oz ribeye which was half fat. My father-in-law's filet was just embarrassing. It wasn't round but split into 3 pieces and was burned. He let the server know he was not happy with it and she stated that was just the cut of the meat. He insisted on getting another steak because that was not a $30 filet. It took 20 minutes for the next steak to come out. He cut into the new one and it was rare and cool in the middle when he had ordered it medium. That one was also sent back and it took another 15 minutes to get the third steak. Needless to say, we were all done and he was the last one eating. The server offered to take the dessert off of the bill but it seemed like not enough to get a $10 dessert for free. The server went and spoke to someone and then took the steak off of the bill instead. If the prices were cut in 1/2, I would have given it 3 stars. I expected more for the price and what others have said in the past about the restaurant.",

    "text": "This place looks a little rough around the edges but it was still OK.  After watching \"The Strain\" I was unable to order any steak, but I did get the fettucine with scallops.  It was a portion meant for a family of four for $21!  I was very happy I had asked my husband to split it with me.  It was pretty good and came with garlic bread and a very basic iceburg lettuce salad with my dressing choice.  I also shared calamari with my husband that came with both marinara and an aioli.  I was pretty disappointed with the calamari- it was mostly breading crispys that were not cooked as crisp as I like or had too much flour in the breading.  I would not order that item here!  I decided to also get the chocolate cake.  It took forever to get to my table because my waitress I think had too many tables, but I totally excused it because she was super sweet, obviously was working hard, and I liked her.  It was the best chocolate cake of my LIFE.  I couldn't stop eating it!  Luckily two others took some bites of it for me but still I ate way too much of that cake.  I would probably go back just for that cake but I kind of hope not because I would gain a lot of weight.  If you go here get the cake!!!!!!!!!!  Also, I want to mention before I went here I read some reviews and someone complained about the ribeye they ordered being fatty.  Um hello?  Then why would you get ribeye?  Ribeye is the fattiest cut of meat and my favorite because it adds all that flavor.  If you don't want fat get a filet!  I kind of think that lady was looking for a free meal or something to complain about.",

It was famous for either a last good meal out of town, or a great place to stop after you and your mob buddies gave Vinnie a ride out to the desert to do some \"star gazing\".   Nowadays the sprawl of Vegas has caught up to it, and the glamor of driving out to it seems a little less like a road adventure. The restaurant can be a little tricky to find since it is now almost surrounded by housing tracts.   That all changes when you step inside though, the atmosphere is probably very similar to what it was back in the early days of Vegas, and that is a good thing. The place is famous for its Steaks, and I will have to say that it doesn't disappoint in that department . The last time I was there I ordered the 12oz New York with Ranch House Potatoes and they were both excellent. Everyone in my party that night gave the place a thumbs up. I have to say that I will be going back to Bob's Ranch House, if not for the food, then maybe to channel Dean-o while I am at the bar.",

You won't find another place in Vegas like this. We went here today for Father's Day dinner and I always get the steaks which are delicious but I thought I would try something new. First, let me say the bread is the best here! It's cheesy toasted sourdough and I can eat 2 baskets myself. I ordered the Salmon with cajun seasoning and mixed Vegetables with a ranch dressing side salad. The fish was cooked well and not dry but it as very over seasoned. The seasoning is spicy and has good flavor and i'm sure it would be delicious if it was sprinkled instead of coated. I don't think I would order it again. After all it is a steak house and I will be sticking with the steaks in the future. My husband got the filet and as usual the filet was perfectly cooked and juicy. Everything else here is okay but the steaks is where it's at.",

Finally, during a trip we made out there last month, we went back to find it.  Unlike places on or near the strip, there's no flashy sign or gaudy light show that will direct you to this restaurant.  Apparently, back in the day, this place was the hideout haven for vacationing celebrities.  Due to it's out of the way, discreet location, I can definitely see why.  But aside from the potentially mild difficulty you will experience looking for it, I must say, it's well worth the adventure.    While I agree that the salads aren't the highlight of the meal, the meal itself is quite generously proportioned.  I ordered the rib eye, which was deliciously made to order.  I know my dad ordered the filet mignon, which I tried and it melted in your mouth it was so good!  I can't remember what my mom ordered but I do remember that it was also quite tasty.  I didn't order a mixed drink so I can't speak much for the bar but I did have a delicious glass of white wine which was surprisingly enjoyable.  This is definitely a dinner I'd plan my trip to Vegas around the next time I'm there.",

My feelings for the Ranch House are drenched in the sentiment of walking in and thinking that I will see Grandpa Frank sitting there at the bar in his western suit and bolo tie shooting the breeze.   Our family still loves the Ranch House for everything from anniversary dinners to birthdays. The food is great, the portions generous, and the people always friendly.   Afterward we sit in the front digesting our meals watching our kids chase chickens and catch lizards just like we used to so many years ago. One of the few True family tradition places in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Not impressed!!!  I had seen signs off the 215 that has a $1 an oz for prime rib on Mondays, so I decided to try it for the first time. The server was friendly at first, so I felt comfortable with my food choices (16 oz. prime rib accompanied by a salad and some sort of hash brown casserole) I also ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms. Mushrooms were good, especially when dipping the cheese bread in the cream sauce. I ordered my prime rib med. rare, but was disappointed when it was well done (I unfortunately let that mistake slide.)  the hash brown casserole was too rich and sloppy and had a grainy texture due to the unmelted cheese. I was ready to pay until I saw the check... I was confused because I was charged for the included side of salad and the grainy hash browns. When questioned, the server said the prime rib was a la carte, which had NEVER been mentioned when I ordered. She never apologized and instead asked me if I wanted to pay full price!! (I only saved $3 with the special) Why would I want to pay full price if the dinner wasn't even worth half?!?! I have never been so mad by an establishment, especially when the prices are comparable to a high end restaurant on the strip. Bob Taylor's ranch house, if you want a profitable restaurant I suggest you reconsider some recipes and cooking techniques, but most importantly make sure your waitresses are respectful and up to par with high end dining customs. You just lost a customer.",

In fact, my mom has been going there since the early the mid 50s when it opened.  The steaks, not surprisingly, are the reason to go for the first time and keep coming back. High quality meat simply cooked on a mesquite grill.  It is what modern steak houses try to emulate but usually just can't. The sides are not memorable but not terrible either. Still I make sure I go to Bob Taylors every time I'm back in Vegas.",

What it is though is comfortable, a down home feeling of being at your grandparents for Sunday dinner by the big fire place. Even though it was very full of people you could still have a normal voice conversation.   The food is amazing, not over bearing in size. I had a 16 ounce filet that was perfectly cooked, cut with a fork tender. The twice baked potatoes were silky smooth.  They serve steak and sea food. My wife had lobster and said it was amazing.   If you need to ask about prices for superb food and service, don't bother. Four of us with salads, appetizers and entrees with no alcohol was $205 not including tip.   Bob Taylors Ranch House is amazing, worth your time to get to it, though in a residential area, and worth every penny.",

    "text": "I was  looking for a good steak to try and I was referred to this place by two different people so  I decided to give it a try and take my girlfriend here for something a little different.  I was warned that this was out in the midle of residential homes and the tip was right.  The place has an old school vegas feel to it.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by a lady that we presumed to be the owner...Super nice.  The decor is very old and there are photos of old vegas all around the place.  It was empty at first but the restaurant filled up pretty quickly.    The service started off awesome but as the restaurant began to fill up it slacked up a little.  For appetizers we had fried calamari which was the bomb and stuffed mushrooms.  The stuffed mushrooms were some of the best stuffed mushrooms I've had in awhile.    The house salad was not all that great to be honest.  I only had a few bites of it.  I should have gotten the potato soup but since I knew I was getting the twice cooked baked potato I didnt want to overdue it on potato.    I had heard that they had a 32 ounce porterhouse steak and I was dying to try it.  I also heard that if you finished it you get desert for free.  So I ordered the 32 ounce steak medium rare.  It came a little burned and rare in the middle which I could live with. Rare..medium rare....blah blah its all the same to me.  I loved the steak!  I finished it and got the deset for fee.    The carrot cake was some of the best I've ever had before.  Delicious.    If your looking for a new spot to try out and havent been here before I'd definetly try it out.  For me it's not some place I'd go to often because it's a journey out there for me and a little pricey if your paying for two.",

Located on the verge of Las Vegas and its neighboring city to the North and the sort of place where feral cats are free to roam on premises decorated with grass and a loose-gravel lot, it was just after 7 o'clock that our group of five was seated on the cusp of a dining room that reminisces of days long before most of us were born, the open kitchen to the left with a team of chefs searing a number of steaks, chickens, and chops.  Predating the era of artisan purveyors, outlandish sourcing from overseas, and even meats served singularly with sides to be ordered a la carte, it was with conversation and cheap cocktails from the bar that the evening commenced, and soon to be served a basket of Wonderbread topped in cheese and garlic the presentation was actually better than one may have expected, a second basket later delivered free of charge and arguably one of the three best items to arrive on the table that night.  No doubt a place more celebrated for its heritage than the items that appear on the plate, it was after an included low bowl of bisque flavored something like lobster that entrees arrived, each offered with a choice of a starch, both the creamy twice baked potatoes and bacon imbued Ranch House iteration competent with the former actually on-par with pricy versions on the Strip while the latter compared favorably to a good breakfast hash.  Moving onward to the meats, suffice it to say that the two bites of New York Strip tasted were sinewy enough that fork was subsequently kept to myself and as much as the half smoked chicken may have seemed like a good option for those seeking something lighter, the actual execution was so dry that even dark meat saw one of my tablemates nearly choke when attempting to swallow without water, a veritable disaster of a dish with 2/3 left to waste.  Told by a friend that Smoked Prime Rib was really the only thing to order at Bob Taylor's it was in a 16oz cut that $34.95 was sank and although certainly not much to look at both the flavor and texture were complex and ind indulgent, each bite seeing the tender flesh thoroughly permeated with perfume from mesquite that helped offset the heft of melting fat.  A lot of food for the dollar, though not exactly a bargain unless one puts a monetary value on experiencing a \"classic\" in its almost original form, it was in a duo of desserts that remaining appetites were invested, the brownie and ice cream combination really no different than any diner classic while the huge wedge of carrot cake was enough to share around the table, the moist base chock-full of nuts and raisins with cream cheese frosting that came across tangy and only modestly sweet.  **  Perhaps a poor choice for dinner the week after doing CUT and Carnevino on back-to-back nights it still warrants mention that the quality of Bob Taylor's Ranch House is really no better than any number of low-to-mid-range chains, the price too high to justify anything other than the smoked prime rib and perhaps a dessert no matter how historic the space.",

We had to ask for several items including drinks which took a good 10 min each time to get a return. Their prices were high considering the sides weren't great and it took forever. Medium rare.

After being seated the waitress or Manager, her name was April, asked me to \"move my baby\" (she literally said it like that with an attitude!) because there was a large group of people coming & apparently we were in THEIR way. After moving my baby on the other side of me she went back to the chef & they both began talking to each other & glancing at me periodically so I know they were talking about me. It made me & my husband uncomfortable being stared at the entire time. They then take their time to cook & serve us our food . The waitress or whoever she was (because she wasn't wearing a uniform) comes over & asked my husband to put our baby in a high chair. We kindly told her that we do not want to because his car seat would not fit & the high chair looked unsafe, not sturdy to hold a car seat with a moving baby in it. The waitress with an attitude told us again to put him in the high chair. Feeling very uncomfortable & unwanted we offered to pay for the appetizers (because that's all we were served) we decided to leave.",

    "text": "Always a treat to eat at Bob Taylor's. I remember family dinners at the Ranch House growing up. It is in the same spot, but since the valley has grown, it takes longer to get there, which makes it difficult for family get togethers, now. When there was only 150,000 people in the valley, it was much easier to get around. Now, with nearly 2 million, you want to cocoon in your neighborhood.  The dress is sorta casual. Well, it's casual, but I'm sorta old school so I like to dress with at least a bottom down. Steaks are always fabulous. I must admit, they have other offerings and I hear they are wonderful, but I like eating steak at steakhouses.  Anyway, steaks are fabulous. The smell is wonderful. The setting is rustic. Lots of old Western movie posters. The sides are great and plentiful. Great salads. Great staff. Service is beyond reproach. I wish I lived closer. If you have never been there before, it may seem odd that there are all these residential homes, but once you get there and walk the grounds, you will appreciate the quiet. If you like steak and like it in s rustic locale, this is your spot. You will love it.",

    "text": "Wife and I had driven by this for several years and finally decided to check it out.  I actually enjoyed the run down, dated look and feel of the place.  It felt like the kind of restaurant that in a small, rural setting would be the 'fancy' place to go on special occasions.  Hard to find that in a big city so that was different and nostalgic if your from a small town.  Unfortunately, the food just takes so much away from the experience that we can't see ourselves returning.  For the money and location you can have a remarkably better steak house experience at the Aliante or Santa Fe Casinos which are surprisingly great . . . No comparison.   The soup was Lobster Bisque and I was convinced it was straight up Campbell's out of a can.  The dinner salad was clearly a bag of mixed salad like you would get at Smith's with the cheapest box of croutons you can find.  Tried a 16 oz Ribeye.  Thinnest steak I've had at a steak house in Vegas and I'm pretty sure it was Choice and not Prime cut.  Ordered Medium and it came out clearly Medium-Well.  Smoked chicken was very dry and appeared to have been sitting for quite a while.  The Ranch House potatoes were regular frozen hash browns mixed with cream of mushroom soup or something to that effect.  They were horrible and I couldn't get past a few small bites.",

Any how, made reservations on Thursday for Saturday night, no issues. We arrived at 7pm to find a jammed packed restaurant. But were seated immediately, huge plus in my book.for as busy as they were, our waitress was on it. Took the drink order, Wifey says her Bloody Mary was great. Rest of us had iced tea. Did 3 appetizers, the Ranch Wings, the Mushrooms and Crab Cakes. All were good, nothing awesome, but good. For main course, I did the Porterhouse, Wifey did Lobster with Filet, Son #2 had the Porterhouse, Son #3 had the Sirloin and our friend had the Filet.  My Porterhouse was perfect, I mowed through it. I also had the baked potato and the Lobster Bisque soup, damn good. Wifey says her Lobster was crazy good, but she took her Filet home for later.  Son #2 reported his Porterhouse was dry and half was over cooked. Son #3 disappeared his Sirloin and reported it was great, he also loved the Crab Cake appetizer. Over all, a great dinner with exception of Son #2 getting a over cooked Porterhouse. But when I saw the giant open fire grill, completely covered in steaks, I realized I'd of over cooked one or three of them too. This place is a prize, I love anywhere in Las Vegas that is not full of tourists. Would recommend.",

    "text": "Boy, this place can serve up a mean steak!! My fiance raved how it was probably the best steak he's ever had. And the boy knows his meat. It's probably due to the Mesquite wood they use that gives it such an amazing flavor. I on the other hand, had the prime rib, which was extremely tender and juicy, but I only got the Mesquite flavor on the outside edges of the cut. So if you're looking to get a huge punch of that smokiness, try some of the other steaks. In the end I wasn't completely dazzled and love-struck by this offering, but I'll give this place 4 stars for the groans of satisfaction that came from my fiance as he polished his steak off.   Some misses for me: the Texas toast was a little greasier than I'd like, but it was definitely very homey and comforting. And I could have done without ordering the calamari- the breading was a little bland and it just and an overall soggy feel. I like my calamari super crunchy.   But this is definitely THE PLACE for your local carnivore looking to get his meat-eating bib on. You can't really go wrong with the generous portions of perfectly cooked meat- even your local cavemen would grunt in approval.",

First started with lobster bisque, which tasted like a bland creamy tomato soup. The cheesy bread was overcooked, very dry.  I ordered the filet and my boyfriend ordered the smoked half chicken. The chicken was so dry my boyfriend almost choked on it. My filet was not good, I asked for medium and I got medium rare. I did not realize it was mesquite style. I, personally do not like mesquite flavoring. I told the waitress I didn't like it. She made a point to tell me that their sign states mesquite style. I explained I did not pay attention to that, regardless I didn't like it. She seemed annoyed. She then offered to bring something else. So she brought the scallops. The scallops were fine.  The waitress was nice overall and everyone else was nice.  But now I'm sitting here a couple hours later with stomach cramps. Needless to say, we will not go back.",

Sounds horrible, but trust me...it's a gastronomic delight. As are the stuffed mushrooms! The Prime Rib? Some of the best I've had in many, many years. Great deals on Monday nights for the Prime Rib. I took a party of 20 out for a \"Thank You\" dinner. Not only was the food and service incredible, but when I got the bill, boy was I shocked. It was far less than I had budgeted or anticipated. What a joy that was. So the extra money went to the servers, all of which were phenomenal. Thank you to the entire restaurant and staff for helping make a memorable evening.

Try and get that on the strip.  It was Monday, so a 16 oz smoked prime rib was $16, with twice baked potato and salad.  You won't find adventurous new cuisine here, but there is a reason why a shrimp cocktail and a great steak are classics. Very affordable. Place is off the beaten track and a bit worn and funky, but it reminds me of the steakhouses we would go to when I was a kid. Great food and friendly, unpretentious service.",

    "text": "Today was my second visit to the Ranch house, and I was just as unimpressed as last time.  My kids plastic tasting grilled cheese was probably the best thing on the table.  Both my husband and father-in-law ordered the ribs with the Ranch house potatoes.  The ribs were dry and over cooked, and the potatoes tasted like they were cooked a few days ago, and reheated in the microwave. Neither of them finished (it's got to be pretty bad to not finish ribs!). I had the chicken Marsala, which again tasted like it was cooked a few days prior, and warmed up.  It was tasteless and soggy, the Marsala sauce was possibly fresh, and made it edible.  The baked potato was burnt and dry as though they cooked them in the morning when they opened, then just left them all in the oven on a low heat all day.  All we could hear throughout the whole meal was the servers chatting about their night off, being wasted and doing the \"skanky leg?\".  I'm sad to say as a Vegas local that I definitely won't be back.",

I had them put some bleu cheese on top and it was so good. It came with cheesy bread and a twice baked potato. That potato is reason enough to go back!  The meat is mesquite grilled. As you walk in and get seated by the hostess you walk right by the grill. The service was excellent.  I saw on the menu they also offer take out service so if you want to just phone your order in and pick it up you can do that too. I think I will try that out with a salad and soup for lunch someday.   They also host weddings and office, birthday, anniversary parties.   They show all the Steelers games here too according the the server.",

    "text": "This ended up being Plan B after the debacle that was \"Bastille Day\" at a restaurant that rhymes with \"Barche Macchus\" when they offered to seat us in a storage room.  I've had this place bookmarked for 3 years and it was finally time, baby!  Bob Taylor's Ranch House is a throwback in so many ways from the cowboy decor, to the music and even menu.  Just the entrance itself is photoworthy!  I felt like I was at some roadside restaurant in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Seeing the chef turning all those steaks as the hostess walked us to our table had me salivating big time!  We got the cajun shrimp appetizer which was just ok.  While the flavor was nice, the shrimp was a little on the small side.  We still ended up soaking up all the sauce with the complimentary \"garlic cheese toast\".    The wife got the filet (rare) and I got the bone-in ribeye (medium rare) after much encouragement from our friendly waitress.  The ribeye was a massive 24 oz's of which I was only able to finish half of.  I usually prefer rare steaks but when it comes to the ribeye cut, I prefer it a little more cooked so I can appreciate all the parts of it from the outside char to the tender center and everything in between.  $42.99 for a ribeye seems cheap these days haha.  The filet mignon was very tender with great flavor.   All entrees come with your choice of soup (it was a not bad lobster bisque) or salad (avoided based on Jade's review of it being IHop-esque) and a side. I got the twice baked potato only because I wanted the cook to work a little instead of paying for a baked potato which requires really no work at all.  My wife got the ranch house potatoes which could only be described as crazy hash browns.  No $12 a la carte sides items like 16 miles away from here!  Somehow got coerced into getting dessert and was brought the biggest slice of chocolate cake I'd ever seen.  I enjoyed all 3 bites I had before shoving that into the third takeout box of the evening.  Considering how ticked off my wife and I were for things not going as planned that evening, this was a very welcome surprise.  I am a big fan!  Not sure I would go out of my way to make it back here but this would certainly be on the top of my list when I am back around these parts.",

So this month I meander to Bob Taylor's for my mothers birthday bash.   What did I think... (Drum roll please)... Great steak! It's hearty and rustic menu is fulfilling and very simple. Simple is great when done right. Bob Taylor's did it right. I highly enjoyed my filet (12oz). The flavor was good however the temperature was incorrect. The same happened to my mother and husband. They both returned their steak due to it.   The service was friendly however very slow to deliver the meals, refill water and give us bread. But the food once it came was great. All in all it's a great piece of meat in a down home atmosphere.   It's worth a try and I would return. I likes it more than Ruth chris steak house. That's saying something.   My tip: if you go give yourself plenty of time due to slow service. Other than that enjoy!",

    "text": "This restaurant definitely does not live up to standards... I don't know if Bob Taylor is still around but if not I can only assume he is rolling in his grave. They need to lower their prices by a long shot. The environment felt crowded and like we were all sitting on top of each other. The waitress we had was more of a Tuesday brunch waitress and definitely not a Friday night. She was slow and didn't take very good care of my wife and I and it didn't really seem like she had very many tables to account for it. The food we were served didn't have much flavor and was not worth the money we had to pay for it.. I couldn't even eat a good 40% of my baked potato because it was so burnt. And if you like a little bit of salad with a bowl of ranch you won't be disappointed. My NY strip was cooked correctly but still wasn't very good... it lacked flavor and I couldn't even eat close to 4oz of my 12 oz steak due to the quality of the meat itself. My wife ordered the chicken cordon bleu and ended up not eating a quarter of it. It seemed as though they forgot it was in the fryer for a good 3 minutes past done and decided to serve it anyway. To put it simply the food lacked flavor and definitely quality and at the prices they should definitely have better quality waitstaff and food. I will not visit this establishment again unless they start selling the steak for about $6 a plate... The atmosphere didn't scream $30+ a plate cuisine either.",

    "text": "Wanted Baby Back ribs Saturday afternoon. Actual baby backs, not the cheapy spare ribs or whatever those other place are putting on the menu. We debated going all the way down to Miller's Ale House (nice baby backs for $18), or possibly trying that place Rolling Smoke; but decided to check Bob Taylor's menu for baby backs. And there they were, baby back ribs and only 5 minutes away.   You should know this is a place with 60 years of history, but probably not a lot of remodels in that time. Doesn't seem to matter as the place was quite busy. As a matter of fact, try to call for a reservation once you decide to go. We got in w/o a wait, but it was close and if we had arrived 30 minutes later it would have been a different story.  Definitely try their cheese crusted bread; top notch. Had $4.75 glasses of house Merlot and $23.99 baby back ribs. The service was mediocre. Server missed a few requests and didn't come by very often, but she was nice and we wondered if she just had too many tables. Wife and daughter also got baby backs. We all agreed; nice the baby backs.......they just about fell of the bone.   This is a place with an excellent reputation for great surf-n-turf and top notch prime rib. You can't miss that wood fired grill as you pass in to the dining room. This place isn't for those on a budget, but perfect if you want high quality at market price.  One last thing, use your Nav system for your first visit; this isn't a strip mall or major intersection type of place.",

Bob Taylors is literally an old ranch house built back in the 1950's, by the 215 and Azure St. Browsing the Menu, I finally settled upon the two eight ounce pork chop option, with a bowl of lobster Bisk, and ended the night with a slice of creme Brule cheese cake. The pork chops were some of the best I have had on a plate, and the price for everything was very reasonable. The others who were with me ordered a Filet Mignon, the crab cakes and shrimp cocktail appetizer, and various other choice steaks. The only complaint at my table was due to a steak not being cooked long enough, which the house promptly fixed, and then went out of their way and covered a dessert entree.   In summery, the service was fantastic, the food was delicious, and the ambiance was relaxed and enjoyable. A quick tip, if you like chocolate their layered chocolate cake is amazing.",

The manager who did not bother to come and apologize him or herself for our poor meals did take one off the check. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

But...if you want to try a old (1955) rustic, homey (was literally a house at one point) place off the beaten path, with simply the finest selection of beef that is expertly prepared at about HALF the price of other places that feature similar beef...then you're going to love it.  We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms that were most excellent.  The blue cheese dressing on our salads was home made and was simply excellent.  The garlic cheese bread was delicious.  THEN our meat arrived!  I had the 12oz Filet and my wife had the 16oz Prime Rib.  Both cuts were perfectly cooked on their large open grill and had a flavor and texture rarely experienced (and we go to a lot of nice steak houses...minimum 3/mo).  We finished up with a very good piece of Key Lime pie.  I noted that a lot of other people were complaining about service...I guess we just got lucky.  Our waitress could not possibly have been more on top of things.  So in summary...this place is not winning any awards for ambiance, but if you want a super fine piece of beef at half the price it would otherwise take, I highly recommend it.  We live in Green Valley about 45 minutes away, so I probably would not make the trip unless I was already out there for some other reason...but with meat that good, I'll probably find that reason.",

All the food we saw as we waited looked and smelled great. We sat down and got bread which my husband and kids both loved. We also got the crab stuffed mushrooms which were very good. We then got our side salads which were very overdressed. My son got the fish and chips and the fish was not good at all. My daughter got the grilled cheese which was ok but definitely not worth $7. I got the ribs which were very overcooked and dry even with the sauce and couldn't eat them. The house ranch potatoes were good though. My husband got the 22oz bone in rib eye and a baked potato. He ordered the steak to be cooked just over medium rare. It came very rare and he had to send it back but tasted fine when it came back. But he said it wasn't anything special. The baked potato was fine. Our waiter asked if we wanted boxes and I told her no. She seemed surprised and asked if it was cooked ok. I told her no the ribs were very dry and overcooked and the fish is not good. She said ok and brought us our check. Half of our table left still hungry as our food was not good. The other half left full but not really satisfied. Considering the high cost of the restaurant our whole table should have left satisfied. We will not be back nor will we recommend this place to others.",

There was a garden at the entrance and some cats laying around the grass. It was perfect! Once you open the door you were greeted with the smell of steak sizzling on the grill. The inside was very intimate. Quiet and just a great place to have dinner with friends and family. They have a good dinner options from steaks, salads, pasta and seafood. My fiance and I shared a 22oz rib eye with the house potatoes and potato soup. The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I have no complaints! We had a slice of cheesecake for dessert and boy was that delish! Will be coming back soon!",

The grill that they make the steaks on is right out in the open so you can watch. The steak comes with a nice smoky charred flavor. I tried the scallops in cream sauce, and it was very good. The scallops were fresh and cooked properly, not chewy at all. They were very busy, but the waitress was very attentive. The prices were very reasonable for a steak house.",

That evening was the Prime Rib special and was certainly worth it. Fairly basic, nothing too fancy (much like the establishment itself) but just right. You can get the meat prepared to order, the sides are straight forward, the appetizers (in this case a shrimp cocktail) as expected and the cheesey dinner bread is pretty darn good. The service is a little slow but the place was busy so no real concern there. It won't dent your wallet too heavily for some ole' time flair.

Entrance is so beautiful, white fencing with lighting all around. Felt like a fairy tale walkway. When we arrived(no reservation) we were told about 20 min wait. We were allowed to sit at the bar and relax while our table was ready. We ordered some drinks at the bar and bar tender was super friendly, made me a mix drink which was perfect. She was attentive and very caring of meeting our needs. Just wonderful atmosphere. We were told our table was ready in about 15min and were allowed to take our drinks to our table as we had not yet finished them. Destiny took care of us. She had such a great personality. Gave us some options as it was our first time there and just made it a very easy process for us. Meals were very delicious, just perfect. This place is like a home converted to a restaurant very beautiful and feels like home away from home. When we were leaving there were beautiful cats in the grass which just made everything fit perfectly. You can't pet them as they are within the fence area but are so beautiful to see there. Four stars goes to greeting upon entrance. Two females there seemed out of it at first. Walking in one even rolled her eyes like she was irritated to see us walk in. I'm glad we stayed because everything else from the bar to our waitress and meals were fantastic!",

Two of us ordered the 12oz smoked prime rib.  One of us requested rare and one requested medium rare.  The steaks came out medium rare and medium.  The prime rib tasted bland and was tough and chewy.  My friend ordered I piece of carrots cake, the size was substantial, however the cake was crumbly and dry.  Unfortunately this will be the last time I eat at Bob Taylor's.  Save your money, the quality is NOT WORTH the value.",

    "text": "Due to some life events it has taken me awhile to write this review . Had the pleasure of taking someone out on a  farewell meal here back in April. We had been looking for a good place to get quality meat without having to go to a tourist trap.  Ranch House did the trick. The cheeseball kid inside of me loved the fact this place has cats running around outside the little ranch house type location . Yes! I am the crazy cat lady who tries to get the wild cats to come let me cuddle them.. It didn't work but still brought a smile as we were walking up!   We had a reservation on a Thursday night and when we arrived there wasn't a host/hostess at the front so we kind of just stood there but it seemed like they had a decent crowd for the weeknight and once she finally arrived we were seated quickly at a small table.  It's definitely outdated decor but it has a welcome vibe and I don't feel like I need to dress to impress. I would feel comfy in jeans and a T-Shirt!!!  Our server was named Cali(spelling) she was very friendly and happy to give recommendations on what is the best options as far as size of steak and type to order. The only red meat I really enjoy has to basically be mooing so I went with a medium prime rib usually I got medium rare but she talked me out of it .. Next time it will be medium but the flavor was delicious . I wasn't a fan of the French onion soup or the salad but the stuffed mushrooms tasted good. My date enjoyed their meal but I didn't take a bite so I can't speak on that .  We were so stuffed we couldn't even get dessert but the steak and prime rib is cooked right there where you can see and honestly it's QUALITY!!!! It isn't cheap but where can you get cheap steak around here that tastes good anymore? You get what you pay for and this place is worth it in my opinion . Just be prepared for the fact you really will feel like you're in a ranch house lol",

The waitress I think is high and could not get our order right.  We kept getting the table next to us order and vice versa.  After waitress makes a big deal of how our steak needs extra time she missed the fact it was pink.  I can not recommend this place and I think they need to drug screen their staff",

    "text": "We've seen this place from the 215 for a few years since we have been wintering here but never went because it wasn't obvious how to get there.  If you are not from the area and go for the first time it's best to have a GPS or start early because access is not intuitive ever though it is right against the freeway.    We made reservations for 6:00 pm on Friday night which I would recommend because the place was essentially full by 6:30.  And even at 6:00 they had a relatively large early dinner crowd.    We both had the \"special\" which was an 8 oz. fillet wrapped with bacon and topped with a portobello mushroom covered with Bearnaise sauce. The steaks were cooked just as we had ordered them and were absolutely delicious. I had their ranch potatoes as a side, which are a really quite good cheesy fried potato mixture.  My wife had the twice baked potato and said it was very good.  The sides were quite generous and there was no chance of going away hungry.    The only black mark was that our server forgot to bring the shrimp cocktail appetizer until after the entrees arrived.  But he was quick to apologize and take them back and comp us our desserts to make up for it.  We weren't that set on the appetizer when we ordered it so for us it wasn't a really big deal.  For somebody else...maybe so. This isn't a cheap place to eat so they should tighten that up a bit.    The decor is every bit the ranch house that the name indicates.  The parking lot doesn't look like it has seen a paving machine in 20 years and we didn't see any marked handicapped spaces.  My wive uses a walker so we were fortunate to get a space near the main entrance walkway.  But if you have any issues try to come at a less busy time.",

This was our Valentine's dinner so we ordered the prime rib and lobster. The bread served with the salad was toast bread jazzed up with cheese ... only one side of the bread was actually toasted. Our dinner arrived and looked good. But sad to say the meal was a huge disappointment. The lobster tail was OK but the prime rib was such poor quality. Very very tough. We both left over half the meat. The baked potato was burned in sections that made you wonder how long it had been sitting somewhere? This was not an inexpensive meal and we were totally disappointed. Hate to say it but we get better prime rib at some coffee shops. Now I remember why we didn't return 17 years ago.",

The service was as bad as the food. Medium rare steaks were raw, tasted salty and tough. Tasted like a cheap cut of meat cooked on a stove, not the grill. Potatoes had been sitting a while, they were dried out, almost warm.   Server dropped the food off, came back 45 minutes later and asked if we wanted dessert and dropped off the bill. Talked to a friend of mine who ate there a couple of months ago, he said same thing happened. He also gave me a little Bob Taylors service tip: You have to take your food back to the bar, they will give it to the cooks for a Re-Do. There are 100 places in the NW area offering better food, we would not go back there.",

    "text": "Visited 2/25/19. My son and his girlfriend were visiting from out of town and we decided to try their prime rib. It was our first time here and although the place appeared a little dated, we weren't one to judge a book by its cover. I started with a Makers Mark old fashioned, sweet. When I received my drink, it looked like a rocks glass full of ice water with a cherry and orange at the bottom. The glass was literally full of ice. So much that it was difficult to stir. When I tasted it, it was watery bourbon. Throughout the drink I never tasted sweet or bitters. Later, when the waiter asked how things were, I mentioned the drink and he had no response For dinner, two of us had prime rib and.teo had filets. All four steaks were very good. The prime rib was trimmed perfectly with very little fat and no gristle. The flavor of the steaks was also satisfying. Three of us ordered the twice baked potato. All three were cold, not cool, cold. When the waiter finally returned at the end of the meal, we told him about the issue. We had already finished our entrees so it was too late for replacement sides. When the bill came, we were credited my side only. We were told that because the side are included with the filets, there was no adjustment possible. The waiter said that my son's.side had more than one bite taken from it therefore it was not subject to an adjustment. Overall, the entrees were delicious. The sides were cold. My drink was made incorrectly. I feel that a more concerned response from the waiter, may have made a huge difference in the outcome of our visit. It could have made my two stars five stars.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Bob Taylor's for our 24th anniversary dinner Christmas Eve. We live nearby and as a 38 year resident of Las Vegas I am sad to say that this establishment is living on nostalgia not quality.  Our waiter came by quickly and took our drink order and immediately asked for our dinner order at the same time.  My drink (Old fashioned) tasted like whiskey on the rocks without any of the flavor or highlights of a cocktail.  Half way through the salads our meals arrived. The porterhouse was dry and overcooked and the baked potatoe was dry, warm and small. More than anything I resented being pushed through like they couldn't wait for us to leave. The upside of Bob Taylor's is the ambience, which was taken away by the pacing of service.   We have had this issue the last 3 times now so we got the message load and clear, grab and go...so we are gone. What a shame to see a Vegas landmark go downhill like this. Too many other quality choices in town. Sad.",

The rest of my family were not so lucky - they all ordered the turkey dinner.  My guess is they made the food earlier that day and did not keep it at a proper temperature so by the time we ate at 5:00 it had been sitting out all day.  Thanks Bob for ruining our vacation!",

I was even served a free dish of ice cream with a candle and my whole table sang \"Happy Birthday\"to me. It was really fun! The only problem that we had was when we first walked in the door. It was my friends' first time there, and he had an energy drink in his hand. We had A party of eight, and as the table wasn't quite ready for us, we are asked to wait in the lobby. As my friend walked in he was greeted by April but not with a \"welcome\", but with a, \"Um, you can't bring that in here.\" He explained that it was only an energy drink and he would be finished with it in a few minutes, but she asked him to step outside to finish it. It was 45 outside. April needs to learn that a party of six dropping nearly $300 should be allowed to finish an energy drink in the lobby while waiting for their table. She also needs to be instructed that you should always greet your patrons with a \"hello\"and a smile before anything else. I've been coming to Bob Taylors for 25 years and this was the first time we've ever had Any issue. My friends unfortunately said they would never be back, you guys lost a good customer in them, And gained a Less than stellar review.",

The meal got to me in less than five minutes after ordering it. That's never a good sign. The food tasted like it had been sitting around cafeteria style. The vegetables were soggy and tasteless - I needed a ginger ale to keep them from coming back up on me! I kept expecting to see Gordon Ramsey burst out of the kitchen screaming \"Shut it down, shut it down! Are you trying to kill somebody?\" That woulda made the $50+ I spent worth it!  On a good note, the five layer chocolate cake helped hold down the meal and gave it a quick exit the next day!   The decor is interesting, you really do feel you've stepped back in time a coupla decades - come to think of it, I didn't see any people of color there, so maybe I really did travel back in time! Nice place to come if your cheating on a spouse. Hard to find, dimly lit and lots of corners. Everyone should come here once, but just once. Just get the chocolate cake and you'll survive.

She brought us their garlic bread, which was nothing but regular sandwich bread buttered with garlic powder and toasted on the grill, a little too toasted. The salad was pretty good with Blue Cheese and crumbles.  We ordered Top Sirloin, New York Strip, Filet Mignon and chicken Marsala. All the steaks were ordered medium well but came out undercooked and kind of bloody. The Chicken Marsala sauce was pretty thick and had the consistency of gravy but the chicken was very moist and tender. The sides were twice baked potatoes which were kind of on the small side and a little burnt on the skin, probably thrown on grill for a bit.  I probably won't return unless they lower their prices considerably. It wasn't bad but not great and overpriced.",

The waitress wasn't too social, but that's okay.  We were there for a romantic date night and didn't really need to be entertained.  That's when it got ugly.  Our dinner arrived and it looked okay.

By the time I got to my second bite, the cold blowing wind had chilled it to the point where it was actually cold.  I told the waitress about this and she asked if I wanted her take it to the cook to have it \"dipped in the au jus a couple of times\".  I declined and it made me wonder if there is a community pot of au jus that everyone's cold prime rib gets dipped in, after they have taken a few bites.  Sure hope the last guy didn't have some disease.  After dinner, we both took our meat in a go box.  I plan on trying to slice it and saute it for breakfast.  I then asked if I could chat with a manager.  I was informed there was no manager, only the owner.  I said that would be fine, if he had a minute.   A few minutes later he stopped by our table and I basically told him what I have written down here.  His response was not very kind, nor did he have much in the way of social skills.  He pretty much told us that we should have picked a different table, like it was our fault that the wind was blowing.  The people at the table next to ours were listening and they made some comments between themselves about that.  Then he just walked away.  No apology, no attempt to try and make things right, nothing.  Then, on the way out he was standing right by the door saying goodnight to people.  I don't think he even remembered talking to us.  He said, \"Thanks for coming.  See you again\".  I said to him, \"we won't be back\".  He said, \"Please come again\", like he didn't even hear what I said.  Either he didn't, or he is just a jerk.  Anyway, I always try to be as fair as I can with my reviews.  Las Vegas is a big place with many wonderful places to go out for dinner.  We have our favorites and frequent them often.  This one just got dropped off the list and we will no longer recommend it to our friends.  In fact, we will try and steer as many people away as possible.  Too bad, because it could be awesome.  Customer service is just as important as good food to us when we go out.  Obviously, the owner is afflicted with a sense of entitlement based on his attitude and lack of social skills.",

    "text": "I meant to review this after a trip to Austin where I had gotten some Texas barbecue/ranch style cooking in my system, and well, it's kind of like cannibalism: \"Once you get a taste\", they say....  (Editor's Note: I have not taken to eating people.)  This place amazing exists in Vegas.  I had never even heard of it until it just sort of magically appeared to me one day like a beacon of meat-laden hope.  Set in a residential neighborhood well off the beaten path, this restaurant is an actual ranch, with an authentic Western feel.  When you drive up, the smells hit you, and the good feelings of Austin washed over me again, right down to the decor.  You can even see them cooking up the various meats.  This place serves up a damn fine steak.  It is hands down one of the better steaks I have enjoyed while in Vegas.  The sides that I had (potatoes and lobster bisque) really fleshed out the meal, as did the excellent red wine that I chose to accompany my meal.  Service was wonderful.  Pricing was reasonable.  Over the past year I have become a big fan of \"Old Vegas\"-style restaurants, and this place falls well into that category.  If you hail from a place where big slabs of meat are king, then you have found your satellite \"Promised Land\" here.  I will definitely go again once the opportunity arises, and I need a good steak served up in a True \"home style\" setting.  Again, I had no clue that this place existed, but I am glad I does.  Another well-deserved \"Hidden Gem\" within Las Vegas.",

    "text": "First off, let me start off by saying I have found my new favorite steak house. If I could given this place 10 stars I would. My mom had eaten here prob 20 years ago and so we weren't sure how good it still would be. We had a choice between Ruth Chris and here and based on yelp reviews went with bobs. Let me tell you, the filet was amazing! It topped every steak house I've been to so far, better than Flemings or Morton's (which both have filets at double the price). Actually this is the first time I got a steak made right on the first try( med well). Also we ordered a ribeye (which normally I don't care for) but even this one was flavored so good and was so tender, I would consider ordering it myself.   Desiree was our waitress and she was awesome. We will forever ask for her when we go there, which will be our monthly place to dine (maybe more). She kept our drinks full and was on top of everything. She made us feel as though we had been going there for years.    After our experience today, I can totally see why the reviews are great.  I strongly encourage you to give this place a try and if you aren't sold at that point... Then there must be something wrong with you. ( relax, I'm only teasing).",

Manager was uncaring and all he could blurt out was how their steaks were grade A top choice and aged for 21 days.   I think he told me that 3 times.  Seemed more like they were the leftovers that had been reheated a few times after other people had sent them back.  I have never complained about a meal before at a restaurant so this was a first for me.  I was embarrassed that I told anyone how good this place was, especially my parents who were visiting from Montana.  Two prime rids way over cooked and tough and 3 rib eye steaks that were like eating a piece of rubber.  We will never be returning.  I could have gotten a better steak at In & Out and they don't even serve steak....",

    "text": "I have been to The Ranch House a number of times. Food was always delicious, service impeccable, and the ambiance is old school and fun. We have recommended the restaurant numerous times and taken friends and relatives for a great meal. This all came to a screeching halt Sunday, 4/4/16. My Mom was in town visiting and wanted to take us to dinner. Since we had all been to Bob Taylor's together she chose there. I ordered a filet, my husband the same and my Mom the lobster and filet. My filet was over cooked my husbands was under cooked and my Moms lobster was like rubber. We sent everything back, our waiter was very gracious and tried to help in any way that he could. I want to stress that this situation was actually made better by his professionalism. Our food arrived the second time and my filet was raw. My husbands was half under cooked and half over cooked. Fortunately the lobster tail was cooked properly. I spoke to the hostess as my husband was pretty steamed and embarrassed by the poor meal that we were being served and that my Mom was paying. I was told that the manager that night was the chef and that my situation could be handled by the hostess. She was very accommodating in that she spoke to the chef. In the meantime, the table next to us were experiencing their same type of situation and not only sent food back but walked out letting them know that they would not be back. These were regulars. I sent my meat back and told them not to bother to attempt to cook another filet, as I was not only upset by the lack of attention to detail but also the fact that food was being wasted. Ultimately our bill was highly reduced but we left with my Moms lobster tail in a to go container (it came too late for her to eat- she had her filet while waiting), my husband ate half of his meat and I had no dinner.  My husband had a long conversation with the hostess who said that the chef had been there a long time and really could not provide any explanation on his behalf. As we were leaving, another plate was returned to the chef because the meat was undercooked. The chef looked at it, stabbed it with a carving fork and smacked it back on the grill.  I can say that we have eaten our last meal at Bob Taylor's Ranch House for a very long time - quite possibly we will never go back. We also will not be recommending nor bringing family or friends.",

I  had the crab stuff mushrooms they were very good.  For dinner I had the new York steak medium rare with twice baked baked potato...the potato was over salted steak was medium but still delicious, the steak not the potato.  My husband had the rib eye with baked potato. ..he mentioned it was good, however his baked potato had 1/2 stick of butter.  What actually bothered me the most was that the restaurant has $$$ so not cheap.  There is no dress code people are coming in with shorts and t-shirts on. Takes away from the experience. Maybe I'm wrong but if you ate going to a steakhouse dress up a little.   This is the reasons why I gave 3 star's.",

Now with that unpleasantness outta the way. The wife had the filet and i had the filet and lobster. First, they were both cooked perfectly medium. 2nd, where in vegas can you get a solid steak and nice size lobster tail for $52!!!!????? Here. Plus it comes with a potato  AND salad. The service was good even tho they were busy for nascar wknd. So 2 filets, a lobster tail, sides & 2beers/1 wine came out to $105 (before tip)!! Where can you find that nowdays? Ive spent that at buffalo wild wings for less quality. Quality, service & price comes together at this place. Its a great dining experience. Highly recommend bob taylors! Highly.",

    "text": "This was my second time coming here, the first time was almost 4 years ago. Last time, our all around experience, including the food was mediocre at best, but it was much better than this time. We came here tonight for a friend's birthday, and since being here last, everything has dramatically gone down hill. Here is the list of complaints we had about our evening: -As soon as we walked in, the interior looked dingy and run down. The ceiling tiles were water damaged and warped and it was uncomfortably warm inside.  -The lighting was too bright and my husband actually had some sort of spot light shining into his face during the entire dinner while we sat stuffed in a corner away from everything.  -The waitress, Jennette, seemed put out and almost in a rush to take our orders. She was very snippy and appeared to be annoyed with our questions about the menu.  -My husband's wine glass had dried wine in it. The water or its glass appeared cloudy and overall it was dirty. -The food was way overpriced for its quality and portion size. The house salads that came with the entrees were basic and some of the lettuce was brown and wilted. My cajun halibut was extremely overcooked and dry. My husband's scallops didn't have any sear on them and they were gritty. They were also cooked and placed into a cream sauce that was heavy and lacking any depth of flavor. The ranch style potatoes were extremely salty and greasy.  -When the bill came we asked if we could split the check, and we asked for a pen so we could write who had what. My husband said it would be split with each couple on their own bill and she either acted like she didn't hear us or just wasn't paying attention and walked away after he suggested it. She came back quickly, standing over us; once again making us feel rushed. She could have easily split the checks without us having to write out who had what.   This place is known for being a steak house, and last time we were here got steaks, and others in our party tonight got steaks. The steaks are subpar to other places we've been.    Overall, it was a terrible experience and a complete waste of money. I won't ever recommend anyone to go here and will make sure to suggest other places if this place is brought up.",

    "text": "A half step ahead of a diner type steak. I'm giving it actually a 2 1/2 star, My review is relative to quality and price compared to Casino steak houses. The place is a 40 minute drive from Henderson and I wouldn't mind the drive if it was worth it and it was not. The price you pay is equal or more to some casino steak houses and yet the quality of meat is inferior. First it is definitely regular cut and not even a Black Angus Beef. I am not even expecting an aged and cured beef but for an average price of $30 I think a quality meat is expected. I ordered a medium rare rib eye and it came out well done and gave me a Sirloin instead of a rib eye, I called the waitress attention to it and she insisted it was a rib eye cause the sirloin cut is a little rounded as she told me.I guess she was all mixed up. a rib eye is never cut rectangular. when you take the bone out it is somewhat oval. The thickness of the steak is under half an inch, perhaps to make it less hard on your bite. You need a serious knife skill to cut the meat and it was medium rare the second time they brought it out. My wife's  fillet mignon was 2 pieces of basically an end cut. I was not expecting a chateaubriand but I expected a descent cut at least considering it is on the $30 price range.  Delmonico Steak house at The Venetian, Gallagher's at the New York Newyork or Silverado Restaurant at South point is way better in my opinion at the same price range. If you are willing to spend more I will recommend Michaels inside South Point too.",

So upon this sojourn I really was not expecting much. My boyfriend had dined here recently with some friends and was eager to return. I am glad I gave it another try.  We were seated very quickly and the staff was friendly. Our waitress was very pleasant and prompt. She took our orders and returned shortly with some bread and the starters. The garlic cheese toast was something I could get in the frozen section at Smith's and it was already cold and chewy. However, the New England clam chowder was excellent. I don't think I have had good clam chowder in a while. This was uber creamy and had a goodly amount of clam pieces in it. My boyfriend liked his house salad. He said, \"it's pretty standard but the croutons were really good.\"  Our steaks were really nice. My 8 oz filet mignon was very tender and they know what medium rare is. It was wrapped in bacon and served with bearnaise sauce but I've never had a portobello mushroom cap it off as a traditional way of serving. Bearnaise sauce was very creamy and more of the consistency mayonnaise. My boyfriend polished off his porterhouse. He liked his twice baked potato but after tasting my regular baked potato said he would have preferred to have that instead.  Overall nice experience. The food was filling and flavorful. I wouldn't mind coming back here again. It does reign terror on my budget. Two entrees, two drinks, tax and tip it came out to about $80 for two people.",

One of our party ordered the porterhouse medium well, it came to us well done and charred on one side. I had the Smoked Prime Rib, it was very good and full of flavor. We as a group were not impressed with the cheesy potato's. They had an odd consistency, and flavor was not that appetizing given how they were raved about.

    "text": "If you want a traditional Steak House you found it! Old nostalgic western setting and delicious full portions you won't leave here disappointed! This place came highly recommend to me.  I ordered the Smoke prime rib french dip sandwich. The best I've ever tasted! Every bite juicier than the next. With creamy horseradish sauce and wide steak fries perfectly crisp. The restaurant's history can be seen and smelled throughout. Garnished with John Wayne photos and western props makes this place a hidden gem! Will be returning soon.",

I ordered the filet med rare and shrimp with twice baked potato which was delicious. Steak melted in my mouth.  The hubby got prime rib which was delicious as well. Our waitress was polite and attentive. It is very close to our home which is a plus. Overall very pleasant family dinner for semi reasonable price.",

Desserts are the bomb.  Friendly and fast service and you can can watch 'em cook.  Ambience is ranch style.  Suggest reservations on weekends.  Tough to find in urban sprawl but worth it.",

    "text": "Ok, very dark in the place, the outside the trees and bushes were overgrown which covered up the windows not letting in much light.  Kind of creepy inside.  Food??  Not very good, I expected much better.  We got the Smoked prime rib.  I love prime rib but this was a bit tough and the smoke flavoring gave it a bit of a sour aftertaste which I didn't expect.  Not much on the side dishes and the salad dressings were very few.  Very limited soda drink menu but ok if you like coke products, which we don't.  The service was excellent though, had a fabulous waitress.  However this place was not worth the 96.00 we paid for 3 meals of Prime Rib.  We all expected much much better food.  We will not be going back there.",

She was in the back packing up some1 order. When she came back she handed the guy his order then proceeded to make drinks for another party at the bar. She told me 1 min. After she was done making drinks. She ran outside to catch the guy she just gave the food to because she forgot to take his money. While she was outside another guy (white) walked in. And sat next to me at the bar. She finally came back in and just completely ignored me. I said excuse me. Are you gonna take my order? Because I have been standing here a while b4 this guy walked in. She told me with a attitude No drink orders come first. I quickly asked for someone else. Soon as I did that she began to take my order. It's so obvious she needs help. I will NEVER come here again. And I don't recommend anyone else does.",

The salad with fresh pepper, cheesy toast, ranch house potatoes, it's just all so good, and that isn't even mentioning the meats! I really enjoy the ribs here, the steak has been great 95% of the time I've been here, and even the chicken is good.",

    "text": "Our tour of classic old school Vegas restaurants continues with a trip to Bob Taylor's Ranch House for a friend's birthday.  We live pretty close-by, so the Ranch House isn't too far off the beaten track by our standards.  Rolling up, we were totally transported back in time to when this restaurant was located in the middle of nowhere (except now the Ranch is surrounded by tract homes and lost some of their land to the 215).  According to a friend, this place was once so remote that the mob used to stop here for some steaks and drinks after doing, ehem, nefarious things to people in the desert.  Ah Vegas and your local lore!    Enough about that, on to the food.  We were seated at a four-top in the corner, away from the large windows that face the front yard unfortunately.  The ambiance wasn't as fancy as I expected, kind of more road-house than steak-house - which is A-OK by me. I love places with personality!  I ordered the Fettuccine with Scallops in Chardonnay Cream Sauce as an entree, which was huge and very well done. Overall, I felt the dish could have used a dusting of grated parmesan for some extra ooomph. Two of my dining companions got the Broiled Shrimp - which they both said was super flavorful, taking on the smokey flavors from the open mesquite grill.  The wine list was super reasonable, allowing us to enjoy a full bottle of wine for the table at very little cost.  Take some time to peruse the artifacts that line the glass cases in the entrance and the bar - they have some pretty cool Las Vegas memorabilia. I'm docking one star because the women's bathroom was a little too funky for my taste and could have used a good cleaning.",
