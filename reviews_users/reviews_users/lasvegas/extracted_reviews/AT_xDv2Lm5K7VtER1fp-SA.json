The restaurant was not that busy.  The food: Steaks were average. The lobster was dry. The sides were all overcooked. Sadly my wifes food even had to be sent back.   overall very disappointing.

The food was incredible (as always at this restaurant) and the ambiance was perfect. We will remember that night for the rest of our lives. Thank you Strip House!",

I am a steak lover. I have pretty much checked out the most popular steak restaurants and thought the steak at NYC Strip House was by far, top 3. The steak in LV was a bit tough for me (I ordered medium rare). The mac and cheese was too cheesy and a bit bland. The cream spinach side was way too salty. My pinot noir was great. My gf loved her lobster pasta (it was pretty good). The overall ambiance is nice, but our waiter lacked personality. He was so serious! Unfortunately, I'd rather go to S&W because the sides there are way better and the people are more down to Earth.",

    "text": "If you're going to the Strip House for steak . . . the steak was good . . . perfectly cooked . . . and the chef did a great job on the Lobster Bisque.  The oysters were fresh.  The room itself had a great, traditional steak house look.  That's where the compliments end.  Here's the rest of the story : First, I'm not an old codger, but I have to say that dining in a formal dining room with rap music blaring over the speakers ruins the whole experience, even in Las Vegas.  Service?  It was very good . . . nothing to complain about . . . but our wait staff had absolutely no personality.  In fact, there was no personal interaction whatsoever.   Courses arrived so quickly that we felt rushed and were made to wonder if everything was pre-cooked and just waiting for an order to come in.  Aside from the steak, the food was not good.  The chicken, while perfectly cooked, was coated in some kind of horrible-tasting crust.  Most of the sauces and sides ranged from mediocre, (Potatoes Romanoff), to downright disgusting, (oyster sauces with rotten fish smell, sickeningly sweet steak sauce).  In sum, the Strip House was ADAQUATE but nothing really special.  On top of that, it was horribly over-priced.  (We skipped ordering a bottle of wine, because the wine list was laughingly ridiculous).   If I'm going to spend $250 for 2, there are so many very exceptional venues in Las Vegas that I can't think of a single reason to dine here.",

We eventually got the crab cake we ordered but the server failed to ever ask how our meal was (which was probably a good thing)   Appetizer: crab cake was just average, unless of course you were going to compare it to the steak- then it would be great  Main course: We ordered a filet with a scallop and blue cheese topping with a side of mushrooms. We'll start with the good, the scallops were delicious, our medium rare steak was over cooked and dry with far less quality beef you would expect for the price. The mushrooms were so salty we each took one bite and spit them out.   Dessert: even though neither one of us are chocolate lovers we took servers suggestion for the 20 something layer cake and to our surprise it was actually very good. If you enjoy chocolate that is not overly sweet this would be a good choice.",

We were immediately led to our table.  Our server Amanda was right there to tell us the specials.  I could have thought there were 17 of them but she recited them all without note cards or anything, keeping good eye contact while telling us about appetizer specials, entree specials, and dessert specials.  She even mentioned the per-pound cost of the market-cost lobster.  We're two guys on a conference trip so steaks were the thing.  We got a NY Strip steak and a surf & turf (6oz filet + lobster tail).  EVERYTHING was delicious, perfectly cooked, right temperature, great presentation, wonderful.  We started with oysters app and after 6 went and got 6 more...    We ordered a zin, and Amanda delivered that perfectly, like a master somm, kept it off the table, opened it expertly, didn't suggest anyone sniff or do any other weirdness with the cork, and poured it for tasting and consumption.  It was great.  Her service of it was great.  At the end we were offered dessert.  Nagh.  Great service. Great food.  Kitchen did 100% and Amanda did 100%.  Kenny the manager came out when we asked for him so we could let him know we were impressed.  This is a cut above an an order of magnitude better than Elements....  Good job to PH, Strip House, Kenny, and Amanda.  I will come back here again in a heartbeat.  Ehud Homebase: Tucson AZ",

    "text": "I was surprised by how much I enjoyed my dinner at Strip House.  To begin, it's got a cool vibe.  It is dark, which I usually don't care for, but here I was cool with it.  There are also pictures of pin ups around which added to the vibe.    We were immediately approached by our server and ordered a bottle of wine.  Strip House has a decent selection, certainly not the best when compared to some steakhouses on the strip, but I've seen much worse.  The prices were what you would expect to pay on the strip.  We split the crab cake to start.  This was a solid dish, the cake was crispy and came with plenty of tangy remoulade.  I also liked the corn salsa.  It was also a good size, so each of us had several bites.    To eat, I had one of the specials, the dry aged 14 ounce ribeye.  To begin, all steaks are served with a bulb of roasted garlic, which I love.  The steak was excellent.  Cooked to a perfect medium rare, it had excellent crust on the exterior.  To be able to achieve such a crust without any burning is an impressive feat.  It added to the flavor without adding a charcoal quality.  The steak was juicy and the dry aging was noticeable.  I'm glad I ordered it as opposed to the bone in ribeye on the menu.  The dry aged steak may be smaller, but the flavor more than makes up for what you lose in ounces.  On the side, we had the mac and cheese and the potatoes romanoff, or twice baked potatoes au gratin.  The mac and cheese was solid, it was very cheesy and had the requisite string of cheese when you spooned it out of the dish.  Also, a serving contains more than enough for 2 people.  But, the real star was the potatoes.  The parmesan in this dish was fantastic.  It had a nice crusty top and was smooth throughout.  I wish I could create this dish at home.  It's a must order if you are a cheese and/or potato fan.  We had a great evening and were well taken care of by our server.  Strip House may not get the pub of some of the other more famous steakhouses on the strip, but it can more than hold its own.",

    "text": "Yes it's a little pricey. Yes you should more than likely make reservations. Yes you should plan on spending at least two hours here. But oh boy... so worth it. Get the steak. Get the steak. Get the steak. You really don't need a side to go with it but if you do, try the potatoes raminade something. I'm not fancy but I know food. I also know good service and as I'm watching the room and listening to other servers, it's clear -that because it was my birthday -they sat me in the area with the best waiter. His name is John. Please make sure you sit in John's area. And make sure you listen to him.  He knows what he's doing. And tip him well. He makes this restaurant run...  that's all I got to say about that !  Happy eating !",

Their steaks have a salt and pepper crust which I found to be delicious. I rated my NY strip 5/5, my husband his filet a 4/5. The kale salad was excellent, so large that I couldn't finish my steak! The kitchen kindly wrapped my steak to-go and provided me plastic utensils. Good experience.",

    "text": "Our plane had a 9 hour delay because of mechanical issues and we slept in the airport waiting for our flight, so we were tired and hungry when we arrived at Strip.  Though we were underdressed it was no problem.  The service was excellent!  So friendly and attentive!  Husband had dry-aged Ribeye, I had lamb chops, daughter had salmon, and son also had Ribeye.  We also have a 1.5 year old toddler and the restaurant, while not kid-friendly (restaurant is for adults, no kids menus or items) was very accommodating.  Food was great!  Husband said his steak was a little on the salty side, but he still enjoyed it.  Wine was really good, the sides were amazing--potatoes romanoff, goose fat potatoes, and sauteed mushrooms were all equally great!  Even bread basket was good--pretzel bread was so delicious!  Our toddler only wanted to eat the bread!  Oh and the dessert!  Daughter had the multi-layer chocolate cake--it was huge and soooooo good!    The only thing I didn't understand was my husband had what looked like a head of roasted garlic on his plate with a rosemary sprig in it (you can see it in other reviewers photos) I think it was for decoration because the garlic wasn't roasted enough and I am not sure what he was supposed to do with a sprig of rosemary...so decoration i think, but not edible one.   We would definitely come back again!  Thank you Strip for taking in these weary travelers!",

    "text": "So what's a nice gal like me doing in a Strip House like this?   Eating anything but red meat lol  Strip House Steak House (it's like a children's rhyme! One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish...) is inside of Planet Hollywood casino--with parent location(s) in NY. All have the similar red walls, sharp, black contrasting decor, low lighting, and backlit picture frames of old-time celebrities/public figures from way back. If you squint your eyes, you can picture cigarette smoke hanging in the air and imagine Bogie coming around the corner with Lauren. There aren't any strongly-themed steakhouses around me (except maybe the chain El Gaucho in Seattle) and I enjoyed being transported to another time. It didn't feel hokey at all.   Steakhouses are not my thing since I don't eat steak, and I never seem to get the quality of food that my beef-eating crew eat when we do go to one. I find something vegetarian/poultry/fish, pay an arm and a leg, and end up feeling dissatisfed.   Strip House changed all that for me. We started off with bread: cranberry, pretzel, and sourdough. The butter was room temperature WOOT! and in a giant ramekin. I do love butter!  I then had the tuna tartare special app: Spiced raw tuna over avocado (FML) with a cucumber wrap, over cucumber (?)-scented water topped with two different kinds of caviar. HEAVENLY. And BIG! I'm a very expressive person, especially when eating, and it must have been weird to listen to me from another table. My only critique is that the spice was not evenly mixed through the tartare, but all is forgiven :D  For my main dish, I had the Scottish salmon over red quinoa with cream sauce and it may have been the best salmon I have ever eaten outside of me making it at home. I live in Seattle, with amazing seafood, and I eat a TON of fish. BOOM. Some of the top salmon in Vegas? I would never had guessed. It was a thick slab of salmon, and was the perfect doneness where the line between cooked and raw is as small as a splinter on a flea's foot. Flawless. Marvelous.  And though I could reflect on all the great salmon I've had in my life for a while, I know for a fact that the black truffle creamed spinach was the best creamed spinach I ever had. It was a shame that I couldn't take the leftovers back to the hotel with me.   No room for dessert, my bill (alone) was $64, which was almost $10 less than my friend who had the steak and mac and cheese. I cannot believe I had all of that, with the quality it was, and excellent service on top of it.   So on my next trip, I'll save some room in my tummy so I can eat MORE!   #100/100 for Yelp Challenge 2013! *wiping brow*",

Strip House was a good choice because it is centrally located on the strip where all the NYE action goes down.  The service was absolutely awesome. They waited on us hand and food. Loved the complimentary bread basket. That bad boy is as endless as you want it to be. Unfortunately, I think I ate one too many pretzel rolls. Oh well...the heck with it! The jury is still out on the food. The bone in rib-eye was ok. There are definitely much better renditions in Vegas, which is steak house mania. Personally, I think N9NE and even THE Steak House in Circus Circus are better. Surprisingly, the lobster bisque was bland. This was disheartening to me as I love a good lobster bisque. We also order the Caesar salad which was delicious.   Unfortunately, something we at here left us with a bad case of food poisoning. We know because this was the ONLY thing we ate all day. No bueno.  Sorry Strip House, you're officially off my Vegas \"A\" list. For now, N9NE steals the show. We'll have to see if Crafsteak or STRIPSTEAK take the crown.",

It's not terrible though. Also, cool vintage/pinup portraits on the wall, and as a photographer, I enjoyed that.  We were greeted by our server Ryan, who proceeded to take care of us perfectly the whole night, without coming by too often. Doesn't that get annoying sometimes? Thank you, Ryan.  The assorted breads came out hot and fresh, and were tasty. The butter was spreadable, unlike other places with cold, hard butter. This is a pet peeve of mine, so I'm glad they do butter right.  Bone-in Ribeye - yes! Good flavor, not hidden by sauce. Sea bass - yes! Nicely cooked, not over-seasoned.  Seared scallops - yes! Wish there were more of them!   Truffle creamed spinach with bacon - almost. Nice idea, but execution was very salty, perhaps too much parmesian cheese? Couldn't eat more than a couple of bites.  Too bad. This ruined their perfect score for me.    It was still a good experience here, particularly because of the great service.",

We ate here several years ago so can't remember exactly what else was ordered, but if it isn't memorable, than it wasn't that good.  At any rate, the bill came to around $180 and while cheaper than Craftsteak, wasn't nearly as good.  We probably won't return here, but I do have to say again that the service here was great and maybe it was just a bad night for us to try this place out.  I'd say go ahead and take a chance.",

It was a nice portion of seafood from the raw bar and worth ordering if you plan on ordering two+ seafood options as appetizers. The ribeye was fantastic with a nice pepper crust. They provide plenty of sauces for dishes but you do not need sauces on this food!  Our server, Chris, was very attentive and made great recommendations.

I had the petite filet mignon and lobster tail.  As soon as I bit into it, I thought...wow...I have had better surf-n-turf at Outback!  I expect much better from a high dollar steakhouse.    It also should have been a clear sign when the server brought out steak sauce.  I am a big fan of Mastro's, Morton's, StripSteak, Fleming's....now that being said, these other places NEVER bring out steak sauce unrequested.  They apparently stand behind the flavor and quality of their steaks without the need for \"doctoring\" it.  Strip House obviously knows their steaks need some \"help\".  I do want to point out that the service was excellent.  Unfortunately, I don't go to restaurants for their service alone.  A girl's gotta eat and this girl has champagne taste.  I won't be going here anymore.  If you want to spend the money, forget this place and go to one of the other steakhouses that I mentioned earlier.",

    "text": "This place was amazing, totally on point with EVERYTHING! The decor was so very cool; very dim light, red wallpaper with raised velvety designs (with silhouettes of posing ladies), different sizes and shapes of nude and semi-nude  pin-ups from the 20's and such, back-lit frames, all just very cool.  Our cocktails were all interesting and delicious    I can't say enough about how delicious our food was; we all shared steaks, spicy potatoes, asparagus, and creamed spinach. Everything was \"eyes-rolling-back-in-your-head\" good!  The most impressive part was our server, I believe his name was John. To begin he smoothly explained all of the specials in intricate detail and made everything sound so appealing. Throughout the meal he checked on us consistently and was consistently easy to find. He seemed to have everything flawlessly under control.  The only snafu ( a very tiny one) was that one of the food runners brought out my friend's steak very, VERY rare (they had ordered medium). John was there within maybe less than a minute (so on point) to check on our meals and once informed of the issue immediately took it away to have it fixed. He returned with it quickly along with a different side dish (as he had taken away the plate my friend had with her sides on it).   At the end of our meal, we were treated to the most delicious and enormous piece of chocolate cake I've ever seen, along with vanilla ice cream and berries. We also enjoyed the caramelized banana tart. We were too full to finish them but OH MY GOD they were amazing.  Definitely not something I could afford all the time, but definitely a place I would save up to splurge on. I was so impressed with everything.",

The only reason I am giving it a four star rating was the wait time after appetizer was way too long at 40 minutes, even though it was a large group.  Highly recommend. Better than Mortons and many of the other Steak Houses I've eaten",

They even had us in our own little corner of the restaurant where we were really allowed to enjoy ourselves. Got a little bit pricey at the end of the night, but the quality and service of this joint was worth it for our Vegas trip. It was a nice way to start off the evenings adventures.",

The filet mignon was amazing! However I found the bone marrow and the tuna poppers appy too rich and oily. The potato puree trio side was decent, but not amazing. The ambiance is nothing special. In my opinion skip over this place and head to the Paris to Gordon Ramsey's STK. it's worth the money. I was there with a party of 5 and we all agreed. Amazing cuts of steak, but nothing else is impressive here.",

The rack of lamb was crusted with dijon bread crumbs. I didn't like the flavor of the dijon with my lamb though. The lamb was cooked perfectly though and I dipped it with my bf's house steak sauce that he received with his steak. The calamari was perfectly cooked.

I've never met a macaroni and cheese I didn't like until now. The cheese was more like the queso we had at Yolos the day before and had no more than 10 small macaroni noodles in it. My husband likes the creamed spinach. The Caesar salad lacked some flavor. The steak was kind of mealy tasting and the Parmesan crust is a waste. The crust just falls off when you cut the steak and it's too thick a slab of cheese. The lobster was also kind of chewy and lacked some flavor. Disappointed in this especially considering the prices you pay at steak restaurants. The grapefruit Moscow mules are delicious.",

The seats are spread a nice distance from each other and the lighting was very dim and romantic.   Once seated our waiter came by to express the restaurant concept and specials. Throughout the meal he was very nice and helpful. After hearing some of his recommendations we decided to start with the prosciutto appetizer special of the night. It was absolutely delicious. The meat was cut very thin and stuffed with cheese then topped with arugula and balsamic. Very unique and not too heavy of a first dish.  For my entree I choose the lamb chops while my boo stuck with steak. Both dishes were cooked perfectly and didn't even require any additional sauce or seasoning. For a side we shared the spicy potatoes which was the only thing I wasn't a huge fan of. The taste was somewhat bland to me and not enough spice.   Can't forget the best for last, the dessert. We shared the brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. So good!!! Three exclamation points worthy for sure. If you're a chocolate fan, do not pass this up!   Overall we both really enjoyed this place and would come back again soon. It's perfect for a romantic date night and they also have private rooms for group events too.",

Steak - It is the best charred steak around. The salt/pepper char is what makes the steak. Yes, it is a bit pricey but worth every dollar. My wife called it the best steak she has ever had. I agree.  Sides: we had the strip house potatoes and the crisp goose fat potatoes. I guess we were in the mood for potatoes. Both were excellent. The goose fat are crispy on the outside, soft on inside. Yum.  Atmosphere: you gotta like red because there is a lot of it. The decor and music were perfect.   Service: Ricky is the man. Best service I have had in a long time. He was on top of everything. Very friendly but not in your face. Very attentive!! I am sure the rest of the staff is solid but try and get Ricky as your server.

    "text": "Hey Tilman,  Question:   How do you go from having one of the BEST steaks - to having the WORST night in 30 minutes?  Answer:  Order the 20 OZ bone in Rib Eye, cooked to perfection, where the next bite is better then the last and you even pick up the bone to savor the flavor - and order the cream truffle spinach.  My wife and I are guests at Planet Hollywood this weekend and made reservations at Strip House, looking forward to a fabulous meal.  As our reservation time approached, we were gambling (and winning) but we stopped so we would not be too late. (Mistake #1)  We were seated and the ambiance, music, wait staff, etc could not have been better! The bread plate consisted of a variety of breads, all which were excellent.  We ordered 2 of the $52 Bone in Rib Eyes and since everything is a-la-cart, we ordered the spinach.   The Rib Eyes (I wont call them steaks as that would be insulting) arrived and were cooked to PERFECTION....the first bite AMAZING. As we worked on them, we also took bites of the spinach.  As we were finishing our meal, I started to feel a little queasy,so I excused myself to the bathroom. When I got back to the table, I asked my wife if she wouldn't mind taking care of the bill as I wanted to go up to the room.  When I got to the room, I barely made it to the toilet before (sorry for the graphic) barfed my guts out.  When you throw up, you can usually taste what the cause was and all I could taste was the truffle spinach.  My wife arrived a few minutes later and immediately did the same thing I did, afterwards telling me she had the same taste.  After we regained our composure, we debated what the cause of our puking (and ruining an otherwise good night) and both agreed it was the spinach.  I called the restaurant and spoke with a manager. I identified myself and told him what happened. He apologized and indicated that he understands that the spinach can be a little rich at times and that he heard of a similar problem happening with the spinach in the past.  He then asked what did I want him to do about it?  I answered I did not know (wanting to see what he said) and he offered us to have us back. That was a nice jester, but at that moment the LAST place I wanted to go back to. (Maybe on another trip as we frequently stay at PH, but certainly not back to back) I was a little surprised that the offer was not to remove it from our room charge, but I don't know if he had the authority to do that.  Rather then going out and having fun gambling, we spent the night in the room.  .  In hindsight, perhaps we should have stayed where we were winning earlier rather then leaving a hot streak for dinner here.  I guess you can say we did gamble....on the spinach.....and lost.  We are at the hotel until Sunday, If anyone wants to contact me.",

Smart, slyly sarcastic and incredibly proficient at his job. He knew the menu and had great ideas for wine pairings. He absolutely saved our dinner. I had the filet medium rare with grilled foie gras as a topping and my husband had the filet with grilled shrimp. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. We had the wild mushrooms and Mac and cheese as sides. The wild mushrooms were ok, not very flavorful but ok. The heirloom tomato appetizer was light, fresh and incredibly flavorful. We will go back and pray for a better table and hope for the same great service.",

It's much nicer lookin in person than the pics online, although it's in a bit of an odd location and was pretty empty on the evening we were there. Nice and quiet surroundings for my wife and I to have a nice meal and celebrate our anniversary.  I had the dry aged rib eye and it was excellent and at only 14 ounces not overwhelming like so many other steakhouses. They do use a pretty aggressive char and the meat is well-seasoned which I enjoyed but if that's not your thing keep it in mind. We had charred broccoli as our side and my wife had a salad and lobster bisque, both of which were great. I won't say anything here blew us away but a steakhouse is expensive comfort food and this place surely provides that. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I shall call this post, a \"hairy\" situation.   I was in Vegas for the last week working at AVN. I felt pretty victorious and wanted to celebrate the occasion at Strip House since I had dined there the last time I was in town and thoroughly enjoyed it.   Was seated at 9pm (my reservation time) in a nice booth and things were going great in the beginning. Our server was attentive and friendly and I was excited for the food. I tried to hold on to this moment later in the evening when I was pissed, but sigh, more on that in a bit.   The food comes and I'm excited, and also starving because I basically worked all damn day without a proper meal. I ordered the 8oz filet mignon and a side of the duck fat potatoes. I was about 1/4 into my meal when I cut into the potato stack (which is crispy on the outside, soft and mashed potato-y on the inside) and I was treated to a rather disgusting surprise.   A hair. AND NOT MY HAIR.   Now, I was at AVN all week. I am not easily scared off by hair. But this hair was long, curly, and COOKED INTO THE BATTER.  I tried not to alarm the person I was with because I didn't want to ruin her meal, but I couldn't hide my facial expression as I figured out what had happened.   I flagged over our server and quietly told him, \"hey look, I don't want to draw extra attention to the situation (since there were parties around us), but I found a hair in my food. Cooked into my food.\"   He was...not as apologetic or surprised as I thought he'd be. He was, oddly, flat in his apology, which irked me since I was purposely trying to tell him quietly to avoid ruining other people's experiences. He asked if I wanted another one (uh no, also it's like 10pm now) and asked about my steak, to which I told him that I didn't think I could finish my meal. Mind you, while this is happening, the pube is staring at me from my plate in front of me. His demeanor wouldn't have bothered me if it wasn't a big contrast to his friendly and attentive demeanor in the beginning of the evening. At his point, I offered to pay for the food I ate before-said incident.    He took the plate away and I waited for a good 15-20 minutes for I don't know what. Finally a manager came, he apologized (which also seemed a bit flat) and offered us a complimentary dessert. He said our server would bring us a menu.  Here I wait another 15-20 minutes, at which point I see our server walk past us, and I also see him give a dessert menu to a nearby table. Our server doesn't come and at this point, I'd rather eat fast food then stay any longer. I flag down the manager and let him know that no one came by and that I'd actually just like the check.   When our server comes by finally, I explain that the manager said he was meant to bring by a dessert menu, but we were going to pass on the offer and just wanted to go and pay our bill. The server then tells us he didn't bring a menu yet because they had to clear the table. I'm not sure if that's actually the policy or he was trying to cover up for the fact that he had forgotten, but either way, he could have updated us on what was going on. And honestly, there's no reason for us to be waiting so damn long.  As you can read in my other reviews, I can forgive a lot when it comes to restaurant service. Wrong orders, being mischarged, etc. as long as you are polite. But if I'm polite enough to tell you I found a fucking hair COOKED into my food and you are apathetic (at best), uhhh. No. Not okay at all. There is no reason why I was waiting for nearly another 45 minutes to get this shit resolved.    Then the bill comes. At this point, I'm thinking the meal will be comped because this was ridiculous. NOPE. It's nearly $100 with tip. Most expensive fucking hair I ever had. And trust me, I was working at AVN ALL WEEK.  NEVER FUCKING AGAIN.",

    "text": "The atmosphere here is very mature, adult themed and boudoir-like (think red and black, nude photos mounted everywhere). I liked the overall feel and decor. The service throughout the night was very good. Not excellent but very good. High class, pricy but most steak houses are. We had a table of 5 so after we chose all our cuts of meat, all steak of course, we all chose a side. We managed to eat them all or most on the plates so keep in mind, they are of a decent portion size. Steamed Asparagus - waste of money. They had no seasoning and were super thick and woody. They should have been thinner with some flavor - not everyone likes the Bearnaise sauce that comes with it. Onion rings - Massive and cool presentation. They must be good as Arnie (Terminator) and company were a few tables from us and it looked like he was eating them too! That man can eat!  My friend felt though that the onion rings were fried in the same oil in the kitchen as the fish and was turned off by this. Mushrooms - for some reason one of our party asked for them well done and they came out blackened and charred as in ash burnt. So burnt that it was almost a joke. We said nothing and I think our friend felt bad for not just letting the chef do his thing. Twice baked mashed potatoes - divine. I would have been happy with just a bowl of those! There was another side but it was forgettable as it escapes me now...  Bread and butter does come in baskets before the meal. 3 of us had filets - 2 of us were a tad let down. They do come out blackened which is fine but they are not seasoned properly. Of course, no seasonings on the table... for sure not the best steak I have ever had in my life. It did not melt in my mouth and tasted just OK. The men were happy with their NY strip and rib eye. All cooked to our liking which is important. Our other friend with the filet who is normally quite picky was very happy - so I think the idea of an amazing steak is subjective for sure. She also had room for the baked Alaska and wow, they do a great job on that if you are a dessert person. The chocolate ice cream is rich and decadent. Figure that with your meal and a side dish plus 1 alcoholic drink - it is about $100 per person. OK for a splurge but this is Vegas and you just have to be better than the next steak house down the block which it wasn't. Still had a good time here and thankfully our male server was down to earth, cute as a button with the best hair and was quite witty.  3 stars. (but in Vegas you should aim to be a 5)",

My wife and I went to Strip House for our 30th anniversary dinner. We left there feeling like it was one of the best meals we had ever experienced.  First, ask for John to be your waiter. As good as the meal was, John put it over the top. He took time to explain multiple dishes to us, and he went out of his way to make our night very special. My wife even hugged him after dinner, he was that good. Thanks John!  My wife had a basic meal of fillet and baked potato. Both were amazing. The steak was as soft as butter. I had the featured bone-in fillet that had cheese crusted on the top and a balsamic reduction below - amazing! I also took John's recommendation of the gnocchi as a side dish. It had a delicious creamy sauce and shaved truffles on top - awesome!  To top it off, John brought us a slice of 20? layer chocolate cake for dessert (complimentary). It was on a beautiful plate that had \"Happy 30th Anniversary\" painted in chocolate. It also had a scoop of vanilla gelato. We were stuffed, but we ate about 2/3 of it. It was a delicious end to our meal.  We have been to lots of very fine steak houses. I would put this up against any of them. Pair the great food with the great service and this was one our best dining experiences ever.",

    "text": "for a $100/person dinner (with 2 appetizers and a side - drinks excluded), pretty disappointing.   ordered the chef's special filet mignon (6oz) and lobster plate. asked that the steak be cooked medium rare, but it was weirdly dry. the color when i cut the steak was purplish pink, and there was no blood. i like a bloody steak for the moisture and taste. they may have grilled it correctly but drained the blood. the steak was way overseasoned and caked with whatever they powdered it with. i found myself scraping the burnt seasoning off the steak. furthermore, the meat itself had a weird processed taste to it. needless to say, i was not impressed.   the lobster was alright. it could've been served hotter though. they may have left the food sitting in the kitchen before serving it.   friends ordered the crabcake, calimari, and garlic mashed potatoes as well. standard fare. nothing shined through particularly.   if strip house were a stripper, it would be a stretch-marks-on-belly, and flabby 45-year-old who thinks she deserves kate upton money.   if you want an expensive, tasty steak dinner in a \"sexy\" and sleek environment in vegas, go across the street to the cosmo and hit up STK instead.",

But the host and server were very understanding. They sat us pretty quickly and the server was helpful in picking things that would come out quickly. We knew we were going to be a little late to the concert, but we were pretty hungry so we accepted that. It actually turned out better than we thought. They had us in and out and we only ended up missing about 15mins of the show.   The food was great. We got the jumbo shrimp cocktail, calamari, 20 oz. bone-in rib eye, truffle spinach and a Caesar salad with a 14oz steak filet on the side. Everything was well seasoned and tasted perfect. Even though we were in a bit of a hurry the experience was great.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed. I don't know whether I am more upset over the quality of the food or the fact that I felt ripped off by the cheap and stingy portions.  A group of four of us ate here on Sat 3/4/17. The menu is such that you pay for a main course and the sides separately. We ordered one surf and turf, and one 12 ounce filet, plus three sides: strip potatoes, mushrooms and charred broccoli. I ordered a glass of cab. I order wine every time I eat out and this was the stingiest pour I have ever seen. For $16/glass, I would expect closer to a 9 ounce pour. What I got felt like 4-5 ounces. I was done with my wine before my steak even came out but $16 for a pour that small there was no way I was ordering another.  I found myself eyeballing the couple next to us as they had a bottle on their table and I was longing for a little more.  When our steak arrived I was shocked at how small it was. I knew we had ordered the 12 ounce which would be about six ounces each. I've been on meal plans where I've weighed and measured my protein portions, typically in four ounce portions, and this did NOT look like a 12 ounce steak/6 ounce portion on my plate. I glanced at the steak across the table because it was the smaller filet on the surf and turf and it looked to be the same size as ours. I should mention I wouldn't normally be this focused on the steak size except that we hadn't eaten for a long time and we were starving, plus for $56 for the steak and no sides, one wants to get what they've paid for.  After tasting the steak I couldn't believe how dry it was, especially for filet. The internal temp looked proper for medium, but the steak itself was still dry. I literally found myself putting butter on it to add some fat which is something I would normally not do. The broccoli had the wrong texture to it, as though it had been cooked to al dente but perhaps had sat too long waiting to be served. The other sides- mushrooms and potatoes- were just ok, but really the overall feeling from the meal was that for a very expensive place, it was all just \"ok.\"  No one in our group said anything at the time because it was our first night in Vegas and we all just wanted to have a good time. No one wanted to be complaining about anything and besides, it's hard to have any self respect when you tell them they didn't pour enough wine in your glass or can they come weigh your steak, but the customer should never have to feel they have been gypped when you're at a restaurant as pricey as this one was. We ate and then had a concert to go to but later on we started to talk about it and realized we all felt the same way, and that both steaks were dry, the sides were nothing special, the wine pour was stingy, etc. $200 for dinner with shared entrees and one alcoholic beverage gone down the drain. The next few times we ate out we felt even more annoyed because we were receiving better food, in bigger portions, for better pricing. Examples, Aria Cafe, Aria Buffett, grand Lux Cafe, Gordon Ramsey's pub and grill.  We decided to return the next evening and let the manager know how we felt but as it was after the fact, he did nothing to remedy the situation. Had he even offered us a couple of glasses of wine on the house or some chips to gamble with I would have felt like their intent was in good faith, but as it is, I would say you take your business elsewhere.",

    "text": "We decided to partake in some gentlemen's shenanigans during a bachelor party in Vegas.  After walking in with a stack full of ones, we were surprised to find out the full name of the place was Strip House...Steak House.  Wakka wakka.  Undeterred we decided to have prix fixe dinner in one of the private rooms.  Our event planner Gabe was awesome and we were able to have some tastefully Photoshop'd artwork affixed to the menus.  As for atmosphere, all I can think of is red.  TLC Red Light Special red, which I suppose goes well with medium rare steaks and red wine flowing.  It's more club chic than steakhouse really.  The private room itself was nice as it pretty much shut out all outside noise once the door was closed.  This proved vital as a fellow female patron was apparently 1 or 5 cocktails in, but who's counting.  If you're hungry you're going to love the prix fixe menu.  The 14oz Dry Aged Rib Eye is not bone-in.  So yes, that is 14oz of pure unadulterated bovine ready to make sweet love to your cheeks.  One of the salad selections was the Roasted Bacon salad.  The term \"salad\" being used very loosely.  Okay, it was essentially three big slabs of bacon with a small mound of greens because the chef thought \"why not, yolo.\"  Simply brilliant.   I haven't even gotten to the desserts, which include a chocolate cake bigger than some household pets.  If you do a prix fixe menu here, there's is no way you will leave without a food baby gestating in your stomach.  So if you're planning to go to the club after, leave a couple hours buffer to drink some coffee and flush your system.  Otherwise that $1000 bottle minimum will be no bueno.  Trust.  The service itself is top notch.  Our waiter shared some war stories and everything came out fairly fast and on-point.  As for price, I'd say it's reasonable considering all the food, the private room, and the customized menus.    Overall, great place to have a bachelor party dinner.",

We walked up to look at the menu and a very sweet hostess Invited us in and said we could take a table in the bar/lounge. It was very comfortable, fun decor. A nice homage to the New York steakhouses we all love. White dinner jackets on the bread boy etc.  The food was great. We all had steaks. All were perfectly seasoned and cooked. No salt or pepper was necessary. Even their own steak sauce wasn't needed, it was good, but not needed to drown a bad or poorly cooked steak.  The creamed spinach...well...let's just say I had to take a moment. It was a sort of religious experience. But seriously, it was really good. A great play on a classic steakhouse side.  Good food, good service, definitely a do again.",

Its supposed to be designed like you are dining in a very high end bordello. Cannot say a bad word about our experience. I had the bone in rib eye($54)...juicy and full of flavor. My wife had her usual salmon....said it melted in her mouth. My son had the 16 oz. NY strip and declared it very very good. to start..our drinks were potent and made correctly. two us split a Caesar salad. we all shared the creamed spinach and the goose fat potatoes. No room left for dessert. Its a pretty standard steakhouse experience but I say that in a positive way. You get what you pay for..and what you get here are really good meals!!",

    "text": "I had a wonderful experience at the Striphouse in Houston years ago and had received a gift card for the restaurant. I was excited to use it, but was unable to do so before the Striphouse in Houston closed down due to real estate negotiations that fell through (their lease was up, I believe). I looked them up online and saw they had locations in Manhattan and Vegas, so I figured I would be able to use the card at some point in the future. As it turns out, the Vegas and Manhattan locations had been bought out by BR Guest (from The Glazier Group).  Of course, as a patron, I was blissfully unaware of this when I went to use the gift card at the Striphouse in Las Vegas. My dining companion and I went to the Las Vegas location and had a pleasant time -- we had some great cocktails (the Seasonal Cosmo and the Manhattan), some delicious oysters on the half shell, a very nice baby iceberg salad (the stilton cheese vinaigrette was yummy), and then the entrees -- a great bone-in rib eye and a surf-and-turf. The meat was generally nicely done, although the outside of my filet seemed a bit overcooked (yes, they specialize in this -- but it seemed this wasn't their best effort). We also got the black truffle creamed spinach and a spicy potatoes romanoff. The potatoes were a little too heavy on the sour cream, but the spinach was delicious.  Our waitstaff was very responsive, although there was a misunderstanding at some point (may have been my fault -- I asked for horseradish for the oysters and I thought he hadn't heard the first time because he came back with spoons, so I asked again). He seemed like a seasoned server who had been doing this for a long time. It was, generally, a good experience -- although the food wasn't as delicious as I remember it (everything was a tad overcooked and the flavors weren't quite as distinct as my initial experience) and the weird misunderstanding (that again, may have been my bad). When we got our check, I slipped my gift card in excitedly. I had waited so long to come back to the Striphouse after the one in Houston had closed down and I was finally getting a wonderful meal!  Turns out, the gift card was not valid at the restaurant. We were told there was nothing they could do in the restaurant and that we needed to contact BR Guest, their parent company. I did, expecting a favorable, understanding response. After all, we had spent a good bit of money that night -- and were thinking we would be repeat customers since we are much more proximate to Vegas now. However, as it turns out, there was nothing BR Guest could do either. They were incredibly polite, but pointed out that BR Guest had not purchased the Houston location and therefore, there was nothing they could do for me. They suggested calling The Glazier Group (and even helped me out by trying to call for me), but as it turns out, they also said nothing could be done (The Glazier Group has yet to return my phone calls). I wish I could say I was still a huge fan of Striphouse and that I proselytized about their amazing steaks -- cooked so perfectly on the outside and still juicy on the inside -- but this experience with both the Striphouse Las Vegas and with BR Guest (and with The Glazier Group) has really disappointed me so very much.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend coming here, considering the other great dining options in Vegas -- and I would definitely advise against being a repeat customer, because I don't think that this restaurant (which is understandable, since there located in Vegas and it is mainly frequented by tourists) and their parent company are interested in retaining customers.",

Our table ordered two appetizers, both of which were delicious, and I personally ordered a 12oz filet mignon -- more than I could handle, but it was equally as delicious. To top it all off, our service was completely up to par with the food. Our waitress, Sarah, was highly attentive and attuned to our needs as customers.   My steak had come to the table burned, but after I told them, they immediately offered to rectify the problem. Sarah, their general manager Gabe, and a couple other staff members stopped by to apologize and ensure that everything would be taken care of. They even gave us an additional bottle and asparagus appetizer on the house!   I had a great experience at Strip House and, despite the snafu with my entree, I still highly recommend it.",

This cut was spectacular and was full of flavor. It comes with a house sauce and roast garlic but this steak did not need anything extra.   Our servers, John and Alexis were fabulous. They were very knowledge about the menu. They were friendly and made us feel like we were the only people in the place. When they hear it was my birthday, they hand wrote out Happy Birthday with my name and gave us the largest piece of chocolate cake. It was very nice. We had to take some back to our hotel and I was further impressed that they provided us utensils.  Thank you for making our night even more special.   The atmosphere was very nice. Classic old Vegas charm. Low light, red, romantic decor. Very classy Vegas.   I read several reviews that said it was too pricey. The price is a little expensive, but you are receiving quality. Come on, it is Vegas and it is a fine dining establishment, the prices reflect the quality and ambience of the food/place. Over all, I think it was reasonable for Vegas prices for fine dinning, in fact it was a little more on the reasonable side for a steakhouse.   In the future, we will make sure to come back here while visiting Vegas.",

If the food doesn't give you a FoodGASM, the ambiance will set the tone for something else later in the night. *wink wink*  On Saturday, 2/19/11, our party of 9 arrived 6:48 PM for our 6:30 PM reservations. We were promptly seated in our own private room.   F O O D:  *COMPLIMENTARY BREAD BASKET:  -Pretzel bread: warm, soft, chewy and salty  -Raisin bread crusted w/ sesame & poppy seeds: my fav; crusty on the outside and pillowy soft in the inside. A slather of the butter added a creamy rich decadence while the raisins a touch of sweetness and the seeds a savory nuttiness.   -Sourdough bread: I didn't try it.  *COLORADO LAMB RACK w/ Dijon Breadcrumbs & White Bean Stew ($43): AMAZING!!!  The two thick lamb chops were crusted w/ a Dijon bread crumb mixture and perfectly seared, then finished off in the oven to cook to a medium rare.   As I took the first bite, I got a nice crunch from the seared crust and then the soft tenderness from the lamb. The lamb was not overly seasoned and a small ring of fat was left which helped \"dress\" the lamb in its natural juices producing a piece of meat that was juicy and full of natural lamb flavor w/ a hint of gaminess. The Dijon brightened the lamb by giving it a punch of tang on the palette.   The white bean stew was the perfect accompaniment b/c of its neutrality which let the lamb shine in this dish. The al-dente beans were stewed in a rich and savory gravy which had a slight smokiness from the bits of bacon. I mopped each bite of lamb w/ the gravy and it was like a FoodGASM in my mouth!  *BLACK TRUFFLE CREAMED SPINACH w/ Bacon ($13):  OMFG! *Eyes Roll Back*  I was too consumed w/ scarfing down my lamb to even notice the sides until I started hearing a bunch of \"Ohhhhhs\" and \"MmMmms\". My friend said, \"OMG, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!\" and gave me a spoonful.  I took a bite and HOLY SH*T it was BOMB!!!  The creamed spinach was insanely rich and velvety. It was well-seasoned and savory w/ a subtle  woodiness from the black truffles that wasn't overpowering. And, the best part? THE BACON!!! The crisp bacon bits added yet another layer of richness w/ a hint of smokiness.  A DEFINITE MUST ORDER!!!  *MAC 'N CHEESE ($13): SINFULLY DELICIOUS!  The elbow noodles were smothered and intertwined w/ a thick and creamy oooeeegy gooeeey bechamel cheese sauce. As I scooped the mac 'n cheese from the bowl, the sauce was so thick and gooey that you can see the cheese stretch and pull from the bowl to the spoon.  *drools*  The noodles were perfectly cooked to an al-dente and bechamel cheese sauce was packed w/ bold flavors. You can taste the sharpness from the cheddar, nuttiness and creaminess from the gruyere, and you get a nice crisp texture contrast from the breadcrumbs. The ratio of butter, milk and cheese created one MOST mouth-watering Mac 'N Cheeses I've ever had! Every bite, I felt like I was committing a sin; well a Lo-Carb Dieter's Sin to be exact.  S E R V I C E:  IMPECCABLE and ACCOMODATING!  My friend informed SHSH that we were running late due to traffic on the Strip and also told them we were in a huge time crunch and would have to be done w/ dinner at 8 PM. They said, it would be very tight especially w/ such a big group but would try to get us out of SHSH by that time.   Our waiter and the other staff were very professional, friendly and attentive. They knew we were in a rush, so our waiter promptly took our order and everyone's apps, entrees and sides were out w/in 25 minutes! Keep in mind some of us had red meat which takes some time to cook and rest, so kudos to the kitchen staff!  We threw SHSH's staff a curve ball and they definitely went above and beyond the call of duty! They got a party of 9 fed top-notch fare and out of there w/in an hour!!! At fine dining establishments, I normally spend 1.5-3 hours for a party of 2-4, so this is definitely unheard of for me.  A M B I A N C E / D E C O R:  SightGASM for the eyes, SHSH is one of the MOST sexiest, yet classiest restaurants that I've ever been to!   Reminiscent of the SULTRY 1940s w/ dim lighting, scarlet red walls w/ gold decal, mahogany furnishings topped w/ crisp white linens, vintage black and white burlesque photos and LCDs w/ shadow box images of a woman's curves, SHSH will set the tone for one of the MOST sensual and romantic dinners you'll ever have!  FELLAS...*ahem ahem*.  If you're looking to tantalize every one of your senses, look no further, SHSH will satisfy ALL of them! The aroma and taste of the delectable food will please every taste bud and the ambiance will excite your eyes. As far as the other two senses: hearing and touch? Like I said, SHSH will set a tone for what will unfold the rest of the night, if not, I'm sure the alcohol will... ;)",

    "text": "Thank you Strip House...you were amazing for Restaurant Week!  The service was excellent, glasses were always half full, and everyone had a smile.  The server didn't have the restaurant week menu up front though, so I thought we were going to start off on a bad foot, but the rest of the night went smoothly.  Starting off was the comp bread platter :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#M64Hy_zMuIusbCGE0v6_RA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a>  There were some good ones there, including pretzel bread, onion bread, and something mixed with cranberries.  The bread came out lightening fast...within a minute or two of us sitting down.  Then came the salads...  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#e3ZQxqsw96YtGaayUjh76Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a>  Caesar was a nice rendition of the classic.... It had Hearts of Romaine, Paprika Croutons, and Shaved Parmesan.  You know it is good if you catch me eating lettuce...I hate lettuce!  But this is when I knew the night was going to be amazing....check out the Strip House Roasted Bacon Salad :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#aXUMZua2dF2xG6vz4uy5FA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a>  More like pork belly salad! Look how thick those slices are....and great meat/fat ratio!!!  Came with Baby Arugula and Russian Dressing.  A MAN'S kind of salad...amazing!  On to the entrees!  Wife went with the Filet Mignon and added two Seared Scallops (+$12) :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#A9XfCIn3WoY9mNCL2xLzCQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a>  The steak was cooked perfectly and had a beautiful char on the outside, but a little heavy to taste with the salt/pepper/mix and the char.  Takes away a little from that yummy steak, but not enough to really complain about it.  The scallops were amazing though and cooked well with great taste!  I ordered the 28 day dry aged Ribeye :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#BCKElERFaMQBWuKn1oCtPg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a>  It was also cooked perfectly cooked, but with that same char on the outside.  The fat was pretty tender, and I ate a good bit of it on purpose lol...but overall it was a 4/5 for me!  The sides, Crisp Goose Fat Potatoes and Black Truffle Creamed Spinach :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#19xyxl1DFKOEBxe_Zc5VDA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a>  The potatoes were good, with the crust being almost hash brown like, but the Truffle spinach was out of this world!  Amazing mix of creamy goodness, with a bite of truffle flavor that was outstanding.  You HAVE to order these...blew my mind!  They also gave us a side of their steak sauce, but it was WAY to sweet for me...almost BBQ sauce like.  I wouldn't order a sauce for a good steak anyways!  Dessert...Warm Chocolate Brownie...  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#iRri0RfZjWsza3vDkf-S_Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a>  Just like it sounds, a warm choco brownie.  It was good, but not amazing...unlike the Cheesecake with Berry Sauce!!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/strip-house-steak-house-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#nj7KTLBgNnGIbW8M47NtlQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stri...</a>  Best cheesecake I've had! The consistency was like whipped butter....super tender and amazingly flavorful!  This was the clear winner of the desserts, and an amazing way to end dinner!  This is a great steakhouse in town, hiding inside PH!  It won't be the best steak in town (unless you really love that salt/pepper char), but it will be a night to remember!",

We ordered the mushrooms, potatoes special, and Mac n cheese.  All were good.  Last we had the chocolate cake.  It was fantastic.  All in all I wouldn't recommend this place for the price.

    "text": "We lived down the street from the original in Manhattan and ate there many times, before and after the purchase by B.R. Guest. While the steaks remain fantastic, many of the little things that gave the restaurant its charm -- both in New York and Vegas -- have changed for the worse.  One obvious example is the Gorgonzola fondue. This was once the ultimate side item pleasure in the restaurant -- a cheap thrill, if you will, both on its own and as a decadent \"dip\" for your steak. (The servers and bartenders would ask if you wanted to keep it around, and recommend you do so.) You can still see the fondue mentioned prominently as a feature on the Yelp and TA reviews. Alas, it's a victim of corporate menu-engineering. Too cheap, even as it was a word of mouth item that gave Strip House its wry reputation.  Like the fondue, other minor things have changed that once gave Strip House its own unique charm. The lights? A little brighter. (You'll eat faster and order more.) The music? A little louder and BPMs a little higher. (You'll eat faster and order more.) The service? A little more... perfunctory, even while front-of-house staff remains on the whole talented, warm, and hard-working.  If these sound like nitpicks, they certainly are. But hunks of prime meat in a broiler are a commodity unless infused with some charm. And as Strip House is stripped of its own, it becomes just another very good steak house on par with many others -- that was once something great.",

    "text": "Not an Epic Steak Experience ----------------------------------  MLK weekend.  One of the highlights of a Vegas trip is an epic steak meal.  I make it a point to go to a high end steakhouse as a personal treat.  I decided to try out the Strip House.  I did not have reservations, and my friend was still in bed.  So I decided to go solo exactly at 5:00 PM opening since I was starving.  Plus, I figure I beat the holiday rush.    One of my major pet peeves is when a restaurant is open at said time, and the staff don't  have their  sh*t together. I was seated near the bar and it was apparently obvious I was not welcome at that time.  Then the question begs \"why the f*ck did you seat me then?\"  The tattooed blonde at the bar was certainly not friendly as I seemed to have inconvenienced her at the opening hour.   But f*ck it.  I am here for steak  The decor was interesting.  It was quiet with lots of red/velvet furniture and old nude photos.  I imagine this is what a strip club in the early 20s would have been like.    Lets focus on the food.  I ordered the New York strip 16 ounce.  Mind you, this is not dry aged.  It was disappointing there was no dry aged option for the New York strip.   The steak was pretty tasty and the special bbq sauce was quite exceptional.  However, it certainly did not exceed the  basic bench mark from your typical chain restaurants like Ruth Chris or Flemings.   So did the Strip House satisfy my epic steak expectations?   The answer is NO.  It was good, but I will certainly not come back.  The steak did not exceed my expectations given the price point.  It was not below average nor above.  If I am paying $$$$,  you better believe the expectations will be that standard.   So in this regard it will get a 3 out of 5 stars.  And another bit of advice, don't come here at 5:00, one may get the stink eye.",

Franchesca, one of the managers I was in contact with, was extremely nice and accommodating. She helped organize the event from out of state and made sure we were well taken care of. Their staff is top notch! Food was excellent. My family flew in from multiple states and had a great time thanks to them! We had a private room and an awesome staff!  I cannot thank them enough for making my dad's surprise birthday a success! We will be back!",

Strip House, located near other fine dining inside Planet Hollywood, is an upscale, classy, yet modern and semi-sexual style restaurant. The lighting is dim, and after 8:00 PM the volume of the music increases. There are photographs from an earlier time frame of women in the nude, in a very presentable fashion. And the service is off the charts. There were literally people standing around, waiting for my plate to be empty so they could clear it, or my water to be anything less than full, so they could top it off. Impressive.   Between my other half and I, we shared shrimp and crab cocktail, thick bacon, a ribeye, a filet, a side dish full of potatoes, cheese, bacon, and chilies, I was literally in food heaven. I am not sure how I walked out of there, or how my dress still fit me after this. Truly one of the more memorable steak dinners I have had in Las Vegas.  The ribeye, and the potato side were my two favorite dishes. The ribeye has a seasoned rub on it that truly emphasizes the steaks already great flavors.  Overall our bill with a tip for two people, came to $260. As I said at the start of the review, worth every penny.  Live a little, step out of your comfort zone, and eat here! You will not be disappointed.",

Our table decided on the Surf & Turf x 2 as well as the Porterhouse for 2. Sides were the mushrooms, mac and cheese and asparagus. Dessert - the 12 layer cake and Baked Alaska.   Service was excellent, prompt and attentive. Carlos, was also knowledgable in what we were looking for in a good wine. The food was delicious and not too overly priced (unfortunately most places in Vegas are). The Porterhouse was excellent as well as the sides with the exception of the asparagus which was quite bland. The lobster was cooked very well and proved to be deliciously tender.   Dessert was tasty and devoured by the table. Lastly, cocktails were well made and refreshing.  All in all, an excellent meal with excellent service. Definitely recommended.",

I ordered a 12oz parmesan crusted filet mignon medium rare (also daily special) that was certainly one of the best steaks I've ever had, likely the best.  The creamed spinach was wonderful too.  The duck fat potato dish was good but the least remarkable of the meal.  Our waitress actually recommended the potato romanoff instead and we should have listened.

    "text": "My visit to Vegas always has a high end steak place to try.  I hit some good ones and yet to give a 5 star until now.  In order to get that you have to cook the perfect steak, have a high quality rib eye and  have great service.  Perfect on all counts.  My brother taught me that the rib eye, not the filet migon is the best cut.  Sure the filet is tender, but a great quality rib eye has more fat, more flavor and is quite tender especially if the quality is top notched.  My rib eye hit on all marks.  If you want a Lexus, face it, you cannot pay for a price of a Chevy.  That goes with steaks too.  People's complaints about the expense is not warranted. Then, it must be medium rare, a hot red juicy center.  This was the quintessential rib eye.  The sides were equally tremendous as well.  Each good casino has a high end steak joint and this one belonged to Planet Hollywood.  If you don't look up from the casino floor, you could miss it.  And if you think the Strip House is a gentlemen's club (an oxymoron), you may ignore it.  Don't.  Take the escalator to the second deck and be prepared to be served the perfect rib eye.  I hope future repeat trips give me equal performance.  If they do, I may not try another place in town.  Chris was our server and he was friendly, attentive and provided great recommendations.  Ask for him and you'll likely get the same quality service.",

We needed to have the dinner last a hour and a half, but when we reached the two and a half our mark, we were done. They never even got around to taking coffee and after dinner drink orders. We had to hunt the waiter down to get the check.   We host dinners often and never had an experience like this anywhere else.

It turned out they weren't needed since the place was mostly empty.  We were greeted warmly and at least three times on our way to the table. This was an indication of the quality of the service: warm, thoughtful, and attentive.  For drinks, I decided on a cocktail. From the specialty menu I ordered a whiskey fig concoction. It came with a thyme sprig. I found it alcoholicky and tart. I couldn't get much of the fig taste. I think I would give that a pass if I dined again there.  We ordered the wedge salad with Stilton cheese. Since we were splitting the appetizer, they helpfully cut it in the back for us. I found it nicely done and the cheese was flavorful. The only point for improvement was that I prefer a wedge a bit colder, but that really is a nitpick.   For dinner, I had the bone-in cheese encrusted filet and my wife had the lobster rigatoni. My filet al forno was perfectly cooked and cheese was nicely crusted and carmelized. My wife didn't find the rigatoni to her taste, it was a bit too fishy, although properly cooked and just the right amount of sauce.  For a side dish we decided on the asparagus with bearnaise, and it was great! Nicely prepared and tasty. Usually I hate asparagus but this one was fantastic.  For dessert we split a banana tart and it was very good as well. We were looking for something a little different and it did not disappoint.  Overall, a great dinner with great service. I'd go there again.",

A guy walks up to you and asks if there's a table available...in what is clearly a very full restaurant.  you say \"how many in your party?\" and the reply is \"thirteen\".  That's exactly what happened a few weeks ago at Strip House.  In this case, however, rather than sneer at us, she called the manager, who opened up a private room for us, and sat us within 10 minutes.  STELLAR.  He gave us our own wait staff....STELLAR.  And all this, mind you, at the drop of a hat, and without reservations.  Then, to really test out how far we could take this, i let them know that we were in a relative hurry, and we wanted separate checks.  No problem...STELLAR.  We ordered our drinks, and after perusing the menu, most of us went the steak route.  The wife and I split one, and it was perfectly cooked.    In fact, this whole experience was about as superb as it could have been.  Kudos to Strip House (and double kudos for a great name, coupled with a great motif that plays on that in the restaurant).  A definite thumbs up.",

Brett was our server and he was excellent and took time to speak about the pride he has in the restaurant. 2 of our party only eat fish and they said it was the best seafood they have ever tasted and ethically sourced! The smell of the mushrooms was divine and the whipped potatoes were heavenly. The bountiful crab and shrimp appetizer was the luscious and sinful. Awesome, homemade cocktail sauce. They stand by their product as they should because their distributor is top notch. I cannot wait to go here again and I would definitely recommend it as one of LV's hidden gems.",

And I liked how everyone was helpful and wanted us to have a great time!  Had their Moscow mule and aged martini! Both cocktails were exactly what I wanted. And the bartender was great and gave my extra dirty on the side for my martini!  The bread they give you was yummy!  We ordered the steak for two, wild mushrooms and twice baked potatoes!!  We walked in super hungry and walked out beyond happily stuffed!! Everything was perfect! The steak was cooked exactly how we like it! And the blue cheese sauce was amazing!!! Sadly I was way to stuffed to try their layered chocolate cake. But I plan to make a visit back if I ever end up in Vegas again, and will totally save room for dessert!",

    "text": "We knew this place was going to be busy on a Saturday night so we made sure to make a reservation a couple of days ahead of time. We got there at 8. The restaurant was moderately busy... about 75% full when we arrived.  The waitress was very knowledgeable. She was able to recite the drink menu by memory while holding it towards us to look at and told us a bunch of the favorites and specials by memory too.   It took us around 20-30 minutes to actually order our food. They brought is different kinds of breads. The pretzel bread was the best and they did not have problem bringing us more since all six of us really enjoyed that kind. We got our food around 30 minutes after we ordered. A couple in our party got the filet and ordered it medium rare, one person got a New York strip cooked well done, and my husband and I shared a 16 oz New York strip cooked medium. All of the steaks were cooked perfectly. The steaks were excellent. I would have to say it's one of the best steaks I've ever had! It had a nice sear and the flavor was delicious. I got the Mac and cheese and it was so rich and decadent. My husband got the garlic fries and ate every single one of them. The server and the rest of the staff were so attentive. No one was without water for more than a few minutes.  The food is pricey but so worth it. I wasn't really excited about going there and spending that kind of money on dinner but it was so worth it and I would definitely go eat there again!!",

We had eaten dinner a a celebrity chef's pub at Caesar's  for for between $50-100 per person... then the four of us couldn't polish off one slab of cake.

    "text": "I came here about a week ago with one of my friends and was very impressed. It is a bit expensive but that is to be expected of a steak house, especially for vegas it is actually more reasonable than most. I ordered the Rack of Lamb cooked medium and it was delicious. I've had a lot of lamb I wasn't a huge fan of but it is great here. My friend who was with me hates lamb and I made her try it and even she was impressed. As far as sides we got the iceberg salad and realized the dressing was a blue cheese type of dressing so we asked for it to be switched with the aged sherry dressing which I didn't think I would like but I did. It was refreshing and a great way to start the meal. They had an off menu side available which was a loaded baked potato but it was mashed and all mixed together. Very glad we chose that. They made something that is pretty basic and elevated it. Overall I was very happy with the meal and I think our Servers name was Ricky (sorry if that's not it) he was great and enthusiastic and very attentive to us. He also recommended a blood orange cosmo to us which was very good just a little small for the $17 we spent. But we expected it would be a little smaller since it was a cosmo. Thank you for having us and I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was rooting for them because as we walked into the deep red and very sexy atmosphere I just loved it!  Service was outstanding. Everyone was very attentive and as a team busted their butts to serve a very busy restaurant on a Friday evening. The decor is like stepping back in time to an old Hollywood era and as I've already mentioned I just loved it.   The food wasn't great and we didn't finish anything other than the steak & potato puree. Let's begin with the bread service that was fresh out of the oven and we loved the room temperate butter which I always appreciate because so many restaurants miss that simple detail. Onto the Caesar salad, my least favorite item of the night. We asked for no anchovies which they did but that's all you could taste in the dressing and the fresh poached egg wasn't working with the salad for me. I LOVE poached eggs but not on a salad. As for the meat, decided to split a 20oz New York Strip and it was good. They're known for their method of salt & pepper char which wasn't my favorite. The quality of the meat itself was great but the salt & pepper were both overwhelming. We decided to add some balsamic glaze and parmesan cheese which helped. The whipped potatoes were great but the $29 side of lobster mac & cheese was incredibly fishy. I also found the cheese sauce to be far too dense.   Ended on a sweet note with their baked Alaska and once again didn't hit the spot with me. The bruleed meringue left me with an unusual aftertaste just after two bites.   So overall I didn't hate it but I also didn't love it. 5 stars in decor and service and a solid 2 - 3.5 on cuisine.",

Brown Bread with fruit inside it was excellent, and golden Calamari Fritti was great with a fine Remoulade Sauce.  And a Shrimp Cocktail with Horseradishy Cocktail Sauce featured 4 large and delectable shrimp.  But the Caesar Dressing on my Caesar Salad was far too weak--like a light oil that at best contained only a hint of traditional Caesar flavor.    Lobster Bisque with couscous and cream was velvety and excellent.  A medium-rare 6 oz. Filet as part of a Surf & Turf pairing was very good, although so laden with peppercorns that I knocked 2/3 of them off.  But Goose Fat Potatoes were perfectly crisp, and Potatoes Romanof were creamy and great.    There was one notable service error.  Our server initially brought 2 orders of mixed sauteed Wild Mushrooms to the table instead of 1 plus the Potatoes Romanof.  The error was fairly quickly resolved.  Both Bearnaise and Bordelaise Sauces were quite well prepared.  Overall, a fine 4-1/2 star meal!",

Our server was good, he helped choose items with us and answered all our questions. Now to the food, we started by sharing two Italian chopped salads. I would not say it was my favorite salad, it was a bit bland and didn't have many toppings in it. Next everyone at the table had steaks.  Two had the NY strip and I split a 12 ounce filet with another person at the table. The steaks came out and were cooked well. The meat melted in your mouth. The black pepper rub gets very spicy, it is great but if you don't prefer that much spice, the server said they are happy to make it without it. We shared a bottle of wine and one person had a martini. I will say the fact that he had to pay $1 per blue cheese olive after paying $17 for a martini was disappointing. I understand that the martinis will be high priced as this is a higher dollar restaurant, but paying per olive is a little cheap in my opinion.  Anyways, we then moved on to the 24 layer chocolate cake. It was very good and huge. The dessert is clearly enough for four to share. We weren't disappointed in the dessert!  This is a very nice restaurant and I suggest trying it, however, it didn't \"wow\" me enough that it will be my go to when craving a steak in Vegas.",

    "text": "For being a fairly large resort and touting some of the biggest headliners on the Strip, Planet Hollywood currently does not offer a real \"big night out\" dining option.  Even though the happy hour at Koi is solid, sitting among those terrible fake plants in the main dining room make me feel like being on a movie set for a straight to video romcom. Pampas is horrendous, and pretty much every other spot is shorts and flip-flops crowd.    But if something along the lines of a legit dinner (budget allowing) at PH is what must happen, Strip House is the only call.  The ambient red and classic dark steakhouse wood make for a nice setting and an OK-ish meal with a few martinis or a bottle of wine.    The chef really likes to season the living hell out of the meats.  The salt and pepper crust on my 14 oz medium rare rib-eye almost looked like sweaty pavement upon arrival.  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZDFzw2lEiUYZW9EsV0YR2A&userid=8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  And while the steak was satisfactorily tender, I found the crust to be overpowering and opted to not finish the entree.  It might also have had to do with those delicious crispy goose fat potatoes giving me that \"devour the hell out of me\" look from across the table.  My wife didn't mind the seasoning on her rare filet, but that had more to do with it covering a lot less of the surface area of her steak than mine.  I'm not sure if light or no seasoning is an option, but I will attempt to request it if I ever find myself here again.    I was impressed with our server as he was very cordial, informative and even talked me into a fruity cocktail :P  Maybe he's Marc Savard's understudy?  He couldn't hypnotize us into one of  those huge $15 slices of chocolate cake that kept passing by though.    2.799912643 stars",

The steaks were absolutely fantastic, the service was impeccable, the general manager, Gabe, couldn't have been more accommodating or kind. Their lobster macaroni and cheese was not only the best that I've ever tasted, it was the best pasta dish I've ever had! The pasta itself is flown in from Italy and each delicious tube is filled with cheese and lobster goodness. It's not on the menu but if they offer it to you as a special, you should order it!! Our neighbors at the table next tonis were quite regretful they didn't get it. Ask for Carlos as your server. He's among the top 3 servers we've ever had in Las Vegas! He's so nice and full of knowledge about everything on the menu. A very kind man whom you'd be blessed to encounter. What a special and memorable night!!",

My buddy had raved about this place, so we went with it. Since we didn't have reservations we just moseyed up to the bar. Excellent service by both bartenders throughout the dinner! Started with the Cocktail Combo, which features two jumbo shrimp and two oz. lump crab. Fresh and delicious! As for the main course, we both went with the 20oz. Bone-in Rib Eye. Cooked and seasoned to a perfect med-rare. Sauteed Green Beans and Garlic Herbed French Fries were the perfect Sides to this meal. No room for dessert after all that! Had to work off that great meal at the black jack tables!",

It's tough for cakes to be moist, but this one did a pretty good job of that.  It also wasn't too sugary-sweet like a lot of other cakes are.  The issue I had with this cake was that it wasn't chocolaty enough.  I could taste the cocoa, but I was expecting a bit more with the decadence or richness of the cake, especially with all the ganache that was there.  I saw this featured on the Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" and I can't say this would go anywhere on my list of the best things I've ever eaten...it was good, but not great.  Many other reviewers mention the same thing and I should have listened because they were right.  The decor of this place is fantastic and also has great service.  We also tried a Caesar Salad, which was good and their Duck Fat Fried Potato, which was really good.  I would definitely come back here to try one of their steak options, but I don't think I'd come back for the cake since there are so many other options out there for incredible chocolate desserts.",

I've experienced better.\" is an accurate sentiment.  When I'm paying prices like those of Strip House, I do expect a higher level of food and service, and this place just did not deliver. Our server did his job, but the execution was perfunctory and seemed really rushed. It was laughable when he referred to my friend and I by our first names after cashing us out. I will give kudos to our hostess, who was lovely. Of her own accord, she suggested that we be seated away from a rather noisy table.   Regarding the food, my friend's steak was amazing. Mine was not. We both had the small filet, and while hers was gorgeous, mine was really done past medium and nothing special. I know perfectly well that any good Caesar salad dressing includes anchovies, but Strip House's version was WAY too heavy on the fish. Our sides of whipped potatoes and truffled creamed spinach, however, were outstanding.",

    "text": "The Skiiny: mid-level quality steakhouse (3) slow service at times which is not good for a place supposedly of this caliber (3) high prices for what it is, I'd skip this joint(2.5).  We decided to venture here for our anniversary dinner because we heard of the 24 layer chocolate cake. Seeing as how it would be a little bit odd to go to a steakhouse for chocolate cake (hee hee hee), we decided to eat dinner here too.  We ordered a Caesar salad ($14), a bone-in rib eye ($54), their roasted chicken ($29), truffled spinach $12 and their corn special $10. We then finished this off with their chocolate cake.   I love Caesar salads. I especially love it when they use real anchovies and hit it with a good dose of lemon like they do at really good quality steakhouse. Striphouse is not one of those places. Completely generic Caesar dressing flavored this dish which makes me wonder how they can justify charging $14 for this. Oh right - it's the Strip. Whatever... I would not order this here.   Their roasted chicken was definitely below par compared to other similarly priced steakhouses. The key thing is a nice crisp skin of the chicken. There was none of that happening here. As a matter of fact, I stripped off all of the skin because it just wasn't worth it. It was seasoned adequately however I expect a $29 chicken dish to be much better than this. It was just too ordinary to justify this expense.  Their bone-in rib eye was adequate but again, overrpriced for the quality. Perhaps I'm a stickler for what I like on a steak. I found they added too many spices to their steak. A good quality steak needs only very few  ingredients- salt/pepper and a nice oil to cook it in - otherwise you aren't going to taste the steak itself. On top of that, the crust wasn't quite up to par either with a slightly darker hue that what I would expect the perfect steak to be (gold brown). Plus the steak itself didn't have quite the marbling I would have expected for a $54 steak with lots of chunky pieces of fat around the meat. For me, a good quality steak is all about the integration.  To serve it with their house \"steak sauce\" - which was basically cocktail sauce (cocktail sauce = ketchup + horseradish) - kind of speaks to the level of what we are dealing with. People only add this crap to meat if it ain't that good...and it isn't.  Their corn special that day was roasted corn sauteed with bacon, red pepper baked with some parmesan breadcrumbs on top. I think the breadcrumbs was a little overkill and added an unpleasant grittiness to the dish. The corn itself was a little too tough for my liking and I wouldn't recommend this dish.  The truffled spinach was probably the highlight of our meal. Rich, umami-ish, it comes in a small pot which is brimming filled with this luxurious concoction. It doesn't look like much but once you've dug in, it's actually quite a large serving size because it is so heavy.  Finally, the long awaited chocolate cake. A rather large portion, it reminded me of the that scene from Ronald Dahl's Matilda - you know where that kid has to eat this massive chocolate cake all on his lonesome? Well, anyway, despite the size, the question is - is this the best chocolate cake ever? I would venture to say no. The cake itself was good - not too sweet with good quality cocoa flavor - but wasn't quite as moist as what I expected. The thin layers of chocolate cream in between helped a bit to counter this. Overall not a bad chocolate cake and for it's size, it isn't a bad bargain for $14. It just wasn't quite as awesome as what I'd imagined it would be.   Overall given the price range, this place is definitely not worth the money. Although the food was palatable, for the price you pay, it should be way more than that. Really I think it is more a 2.5 kind joint but I will bump it up to a 3 for the spinach and cake. So even though it rates a 3 star,  I'd give this one a pass.",

High point: filet topped with crab was excellent. Everyone enjoyed their steaks. The tuna was also good. Garlic green beans were also a winner, as were the loaded gratin potatoes (on special) and the mac n cheese. Low point: asparagus was bland.  High point: brownie sundae and the torte were favorites. Cheesecake was very smooth and yummy as well, but needed extra sauce. Low point: creme brulee ...ick for me.  Service was great on a Sunday night. Atmosphere is nice.",

We were staying at Aria in City Center so it was a quick walk over to PH. The food at Strip House was superb! We ordered the Roasted Bacon appetizer, no regrets there.  I had the filet mignon and upgraded by adding two giant buttery sea scallops for my steak topper. Divine. Husband had the New York Strip and we shared the wonderful potatoes romanoff. I couldn't finish the meal so forget about dessert. The bread basket kept getting refilled and I had a Margarita while my husband had red wine.  I liked the interior decor. It was dark and felt very old Hollywood. Lots of red and black. The Ladies bathroom was very quaint. Overall a very memorable experience!",

If you bring a nice bottle for a special occasion, Per Jared, there is no way they will break policy.   The policy is that you have to BUY another bottle from the wine list which is more expensive than the entire dinner.   No exceptions, with attitude.  Jarad should not be in a customer service position.  If we had not committed to this reservation and location near our show, we would have turned and walked away.   Shameful as a part of Planet Hollywood, that this kind of rude behavior can impact a guest.    Sad. Jarad looks to be about 22, and acts like he has no experience with a high end restaurant.  There are so, so many choices in Vegas.  I urge you to go somewhere else where I am sure they will appreciate your business.  Part two  The food was decent, somewhat average for a high end steak house.  Mastros, STK, and Ruth'sChris have better steaks.  The food was slow.  We waited 20 minutes after a salad for the entree.   The waiters were ok, not great, not bad.  Just sort of off on timing.   My overall thought.  While I had good experience here in the past, things have changed and they are not close to the previous high standard.  Also for the money at a minimum expect people to be nice.  No so much here.    Try STK at Cosmo.  Much better.",

RICKY IS THE MAN! He provided us with one of the best table experiences we have ever had. Such a gentleman, addressing us with \"yes sir, yes ma'am\". Everything he suggested tasted amazing. We would come back here for Ricky and for the black pepper crusted rib eye. Ps...when he suggests the famous 24 layer chocolate cake, don't say no even though you think you cannot possibly eat another bite. Like Ricky says, you won't regret it",

I've been to this restaurant on several occasions, and I walked through the door knowing pretty much what I wanted. After five minutes talking to my waiter Brian C, I had completely changed my order.   He recommended the Prosciutto Rolls, prosciutto wrapped around fluffy goat cheese, with shaved parmesan and spicy balsamic. Without hyperbole, it's the best appetizer I've eaten. I also ordered the dry aged rib eye and the spicy au gratin potatoes.   Every recommendation was spot on. The food, the service, the wine (Arrowood Cabernet FTW!) were all spectacular!  This is what makes visiting a high end restaurant well worth the cost. I highly recommend the Strip House, and even more, Brian!",

Oh wait, the waiter says, I forgot to tell you that we're out of surf and turf. Wtf? So why did you even include that on the specials? Anyway, he offered to switch lobster for lump crab meat. Meh, ok, I'll try it.  Crab was dry and tasteless, filet was sooo dry, such a shame, I love a good steak. In fact, everyone at my table said their steak was dry. BOO  The \"fondue\" appetizer wasn't really fondue but it was still tasty, tuna tartare was delicious, creamed truffle spinach was rich and delicious, and their famous chocolate cake was pretty bomb also.

I think that the lacking in food quality might have made me the way that I feel today....   Also the service was horrible! The first waiter was rude because I asked if I could have a separate check for the drinks and his reply was \"no\"... that was it. Also our female waitress acted like she was going to cry, as if she had some personal problems. She was not having any of the small talk from our table.   I know that our average age was 25 but we're there looking for a great meal, so overall we paid $260 for 5 meals when it might as well been 5 dogs from the weinershniztle.

To top it all off we could not even ordered dessert as I could not put another piece of food in my mouth, yet Carlos knew it was my birthday and ended up bringing out the 24 layer chocolate cake, as a birthday dessert gift! Hands down, the best restaurant experience I have ever had exclamation point",

It's a little harder to find since it's inside a casino and then you need to rent a camel and a guide to find it from there. Bring water or your alcoholic beverage of choice to tide you over till you find it. Professor Livingston I presume?! No? You're just a dancer? Where is The Strip House? I've received top notch service here every time. The wait staff has just the right amount of personable cheeriness and attentiveness without constantly interrupting. The Strip House can get super busy so plan a head. The decor is awesome here! Low lights, red highlights and vintage photos of pin-ups/nude models. It has a real old school classy vibe... if you are seated in the back it almost feels like a speak easy. The steaks here are magnificent. Both my father and my buddy both were wholly impressed by the steaks. The side dishes I've tried have a bit to be desired (I did... mac n' cheese and 2 nonstandard potato dishes) so next time I'll stick with the standard mashed potatoes. They make good strong drinks, have a decent selection of more expensive sipping alcohols and carry a good stock of vino.  The desserts here are a bit underwhelming in size but they are very well made and quite tasty. No meal is complete with out dessert! I feel like I would be more suited to smoking a cigar here and enjoying a the ambiance. It's quite comfy and welcoming here and this joint has become one of my faves in LV. I'll definitely stop here for some burnt cow sacrifices whenever I'm in town. I'm a fan!",

(All meals are a la carte) My friends got the filet mignon. When our steaks arrived they were charred horribly pretty much burnt. (I think we upset the cooks with our tardiness) the food was also very salty...we ordered the lobster bisque which was good and Caesar salad but who messes up salad. I was disappointed especially with the amount of money we spent $300 for 3 people....spend your money at Caesars palace buffet, more bang for your buck.",

In a quick search of places, it seemed like the only steak house that was open a little later (closed at 11:30pm on weekends).  The food here was good, but not good enough to make me want to go back there.  Also, the portions are pretty big.  Two people could probably share one dinner entree.  For example, their steaks only listed 16oz or 20oz sizes on the menu.",

    "text": "I'm usually not a fan of eating steak out in restaurants because I can buy great steak at Costco for about $30 for three pieces of ribeye and I think I make a pretty good one.  Anyway our company was in town for a conference and we didn't finish our day until about 10pm.  Since we were staying in the Planet Hollywood, our CFO said let's eat here as he ate here the night before.    Strip Steak is in the Mezzanie level next to Koi which is a restaurant/club.  Strip Steak definitely has the feel of a steak house, much like Morton's or Ruth Chris where it's dark inside with wooden chairs, booths and etc.  I had a taste of the tuna, avocado salad which was pretty good however my colleague said there was too much avocado.  I ordered a mac and cheese which was decent and a 28 day dry aged rib eye.  The steak was on the dryer side but it was delicious.  Not sure what seasoning they used but it definitely had a lot of flavor.  I usually don't enjoy steak out in a restaurant but this one changed my mind in the sense that I should get steak next time I eat out.  It could also be that I was super hungry because I didn't eat all day.  I think it was the former though.  I ordered a strawberry mojito which was fantastic with pieces of strawberry in it.  As for why this place gets four stars and not five?  The service.  The waiter seemed to have a harsh tone when talking to us.  He wasn't pleasant, just said what do you want or do you want this and etc.  We all felt the service wasn't good so I was glad it wasn't just me.  Anyway if I am yearning for steak again and am in the middle of the strip, I might come back.  I ate at Cut before and I think the one here was better.",

I cannot honestly say that I had the best filet mignon of my life here, but it was definitely up there in the top 5.  But their creamed spinach with truffles...my goodness.  The spinach was absolutely to die for!  It is a must if you go there.  We had the goose fat potato, but that was just ok for me. We also shared the bib salad, which was also quite good.   We also tried the house chocolate cake, and I have to say that I was quite impressed.  We boxed most of it, seeing that it is a 24 layer chocolate cake, but it was well worth it.  We ate off of it for the next 3 days.  It was not too sweet, and the cake was moist, delish!  The service was also impeccable.  Our server definitely deserved his tip.  I guess the service should be amazing when you're dropping that amount of money.  But I definitely recommend this restaurant, you won't be disappointed.",

He wasn't terribly responsive to the table's needs. I probably won't go back to this restaurant if/when I go back to Las Vegas. If I Want to go to the Strip House, I'll make the trip to Houston.",

    "text": "A little conflicted about the rating here as the food was really good.  But where the food merited a better rating, I couldn't bring myself to rate higher than three for the value.  And not 'Vegas' value, but compared against other high end steak houses it prices against.  That being said, here we go: 16 Oz NY Strip, medium:  very good, pink throughout with no trace of red, cooked to perfection.  Seasoning for me was fine, but I like things with a little zest, others may find it overly seasoned or salted.  Even so, it really only served as a crust and did not detract from the flavor of the meat itself.  Good cut, minimal marbling, but enough to provide some flavor.  The creamed spinach with bacon was simply amazing; flavored with garlic, truffle oil and large pieces of bacon throughout; I would highly recommend it.  Whipped potatoes and Potatoes Romanov were good, but paled in comparison to the spinach.  ides are served in very small portions, probably enough for two but no more.  Which, for the spinach was a crime.  No dessert tonight.  Service was excellent as well, Chris was our waiter and he was attendant and professional and as good as any I have seen at any similar establishment.  Liked the Vargas girl styled photos throughout as well. To summarize: Food was 3.5 stars ( down from 4 due to the 2 sides which were 'meh')'  service was 5 and value was around a 3 at best, hence the overall rating.",

The decor right down to the sillouettes of naked ladies on the napkins more than satisfied my pin-up fetish. I expected the floors to be plush red carpet as well and was surprised to see small tiles. At first I was concerned about noise. (The Palm at Ceasars has a tiled floor and gets ridiculously loud when it's full.) However, the sound level was perfect. Not sure how they did it--perhaps the velvet in the wallpaper was sufficient to absorb the sound.   I was also pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was. In fact, Planet Hollywood in general was totally jamming. Wonderful sight!!  The service was impeccable: never rushed, thoughtful, and thorough without being intrusive. And the food was outstanding. I mostly eat a raw vegan diet when I am on my own. And everyonce in a while, on special occasions, I go overboard. Last night was that night and I was lucky enough to have the best lamb chop I've ever tasted. Extraordinary. The beet salad was beautiful. And my chocolate ice cream filled, hot fudge drenched, pastry puff was scrumptious, simple, and somehow was not overly sweet. Again, perfect.    My companions loved their steaks and all agreed on the excellent service. The winelist was consistent and well suited. Yay! for my favorite: Duckhorn Merlot. I can't wait to go big again.  Decadence in perfect balance.",

    "text": "Strip House serves very good food. I enjoyed the 22-oz. ribeye (cut me some slack, it's only 16 oz. without the bone), and my husband had the filet mignon. Both were excellent and didn't require any of the special sauces you can add (particularly the ribeye, which was appropriately marbled for flavor). Accompaniments like the truffled cream spinach and goose fat potatoes were as good as they sound. Bread served and replenished before the meal was hot and tasty, and the chef even threw in an amuse bouche (a pureed potato soup of some sort).  So why not 5 stars? First off, service was slow. Diners who sat after we did were served before - not sure why. In Vegas where time stands still, this is less of an issue than it typically would be, but nevertheless, it was strange. And with a 10pm reservation, it seems unnecessary. Second, service seemed slightly amateur. Everyone was friendly, but there were little snafus a restaurant like this should never exhibit, like the wine being opened without a dinner napkin, and the amuse bouche being delivered twice. Third, as much as I wanted to love the atmosphere, something just seemed a little off. Maybe it's the Planet Hollywood resort itself, but it bordered on almost tacky - almost. For some reason, in the private room next to us, Oprah was airing on their TV - very weird. And even the choice of flooring...I don't know...it felt like a linoleum diner floor.   Those things aside, this is a good spot, as my 4 stars imply, and many will love it (as evidenced by these reviews). Personally, I prefer Strip Steak and BOA for a Vegas joint with a hip vibe, and Craftsteak and Prime for fancier and more traditional.",

I ordered the watermelon martini which was just ok, its funny because our amuse bouche tasted just like my martini mixture since it was made with watermelon also. We started off with new england scallops, wow! it was one of the best scallop dishes I've ever had. Just melt in your mouth and the sweetness from the corn and the sauce was amazing. The scallops were enormous and perfectly seared on the outside. Next I ordered the filet and my fiance had the Ny strip both were cooked perfectly nice medium rare with a nice char crust and coarse salt. lso wanted the potatoes romaneoff  but they weren't able to make them so we settled for mashed potatoes. We were both so full and had no room for dessert. Its a bit pricey but  I did it enjoy everything very much!",

The food was great, the service was steller (and that was after i spilled a glass of water all over the floor). I had a filet and it was perfectly cooked. I'm not a huge spinach fan but I now understand why pop-eye loved it so much. This place made it really well. It should be a side you plan on ordering when you. Do yourself a favor and placed a reservation on OpenTable or on Yelp to get the time you want. The only downside I experienced was the hostesses seemed to be way too snooty which I really hate about fancy resturants.",

    "text": "I have never been to a nice restaurant. From food, service, decor, atmosphere. So impressed from start to finish. We had heard about the Strip House before, as we stay at Planet Hollywood every time we are in Vegas, but have usually made it too late in time for dinner.  We were sat right away, and our waiter who served us was extremely helpful. He told us all the specials, and came back quite frequently to check on us. The wait staff of the entire restaurant was so quick and helpful, I felt like I was in a Disney movie. If your water glass got less than half full, it was instantly filled, bread was replaced quickly (which it needed to be, because it was fresh baked and delicious!), and every item we ordered was brought out almost immediately. It was fantastic. And everyone was very polite.  For our appetizer, we shared a jumbo ship cocktail which was extraordinary. I ordered a lobster linguine, and my boyfriend ordered a new York strip with onion strings. My lobster linguine was good, but it wasn't as amazing as I hoped. My boyfriends steak on the others hand.. Was absolutely MOUTHWATERING! As soon as I tried a bite, it melted in my mouth and I had to check if it was unicorn because it was so magical.  I tried a few bites with onion strings and the pairing of the salty bite with the perfect savory steak was just amazing.  For dessert we shared the house cheesecake, which had a hint of citrus and a sweet, almost white chocolate topping, also amazing and perfect. My boyfriend had a glass of Knob Creek and I had a small Baileys Irish Creme. Perfect ending to a perfect meal. The decor of the restaurant was styled like an old fashion burlesque hall, with red printed wall paper and dim lighting, and lots of framed black and white photos of silent film stars and burlesque dancers. The beautiful restroom had rose wall paper on top and tiled red bejeweled brick on the bottom, the entire place is gorgeous.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to The Strip House for dinner on New Year's Eve. So my thoughts were that on a night as crazy as NYE and in a hotel that is about a minute away from being another Harrah's property, we are probably not going to have the best meal ever. Man was i wrong...   1st, the service was fantastic...happy wait staff who talked you up while they were working, were attentive at all times, and made accommodations on a very busy night. For example, I brought a really nice bottle of wine with me, and the waiter thought that maybe I would not be allowed to do that (I had called ahead, and they had a \"buy bottle/waive corkage\" policy). he confirmed with the manager, everything was cool, and he even shared a drink with us.   2nd, the food!! This is truly a steakhouse...you ask for your meat cooked a certain way, it gets cooked that way. Perfectly seasoned, great portions, and the sides are fantastic. Signature creamed spinach, Potatoes Roskoff...you are not leaving that place hungry, and if you have not eaten something that made you say NOTHING but only smile to yourself....than you should give this place a chance.   3rd, the drinks...we had to wait a couple minutes at the bar because we were early, so we grabbed a drink. This place had a couple of really sharp guys behind the bar; knowledgeable, friendly, no one waited for drinks and they realized that if you are paying $12 for a drink, you should be getting $12 worth of liquor.   Finally, the atmosphere. I have only been to a couple of places where the decor and atmosphere is...in my opinion...perfect. Strip House is such a place. It is loud enough to make you feel like you picked the right place, but not so deafening you can't hear your companions. Dark velvet wallpaper covered with pictures of '30's burlesque strippers lit from behind. High-back booths you can sink into and watch people go by.   If none of that is motivation to go, here are five final words that may do it: Twenty-One Layer Chocolate Cake.   Happy new year!!",

    "text": "A group of friends and I stayed at Planet Hollywood Westgate for NYE's weekend and we chose The Strip House cause 1) it was conveniently located on the premises 2) reviews were excellent here on Yelp. (Thanks Yelpers) & 3) we wanted to have an excellent last dinner of the year. They accommodated our group of 10 nicely. We had an awesome waiter, Andrew. He was helpful with what was on the menu and I almsot believed that he was the one who created the menu. He memorized that menu down to a T with all of the night's specials. We started off with two of the Seafood Plateau appetizer. This is based on market price so it's worth it if you're a seafood lover and all of us were. Everything was fresh and good. I got the 10 oz. filet mignon, medium well with a butterfly cut. The sides are table shared sides (if you want to, that is). The side I got to share with the table was the Black Truffle Cream Spinach. Both dishes were delicious! I pretty much cleaned up the plate. It was worth every penny spent. Oh and I can't leave out that the table got a slice of the restaurant's infamous 24-layer cake. It was super rich in chocolate and milk would have helped out a lot. Ten people and we couldn't finish that single slice.  The place is a bit on the high end but that's what you get with a steakhouse. Let's just say our ten person bill was 2 bills short of a grand.    Overall, I give this place 5 stars for service, food, and atmosphere and of course the great friends that made it even better.",

He responded no. The problem is there was hardly anyone there so they were not busy at all. When the steaks arrived they were overcooked not at all medium rare. The manager I believe named Chris said just because the outside was blackened it was medium rare, no idea what the outside has to do with the inside of a steak? Either way there was no excuse from the manager why it took 1.5 hours to overcook a steak. My wife and I left to eat elsewhere. Sent a note to the GM there and no response. Gave them a chance to not post a neative review but since no response, here we are. Vegas is about fun and service, Strip House is neither.",

Not too shabby at all.  We shared the tuna tartare to start - which actually had a kick to it.  A very good iteration of this dish.  Also shared a garden salad, that came with a parmesan crisp.  Sides were the asparagus, green beans and garlic fries.  The french fries were crispy and we ate them all.  They even made mint tea for us with fresh mint, although it wasn't on the menu.  Great service throughout the meal.  The steak was better than any I've had at a steakhouse in San Francisco, although not Peter Luger quality.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Dissapointing experience compared to Strip House in NYC.  We went to the restaurant August 29th 2014. When we arrived, we were showed to our table by a hostess and our waiter then came by the table and handed us our menus and left again. We had booked the restaurant 3 months in advance to our stay in Vegas and had already decided what to get: the Porterhouse for 2 :)   Anyway - we ordered the lobster bisque for starter and the porterhouse as main and decided to order our desserts (the chocolate cake) when we were done with our first 2 courses.  My husband doesn't drink alcohol, so he just had water, but I ordered a blueberry cosmo to begin with and as Im not very educated in wines, I asked our waiter if he could suggest something to compliment the main course. His answer was: \"I'll find something\" and then he left our table.   5 minutes later he placed the cosmo on our table saying nothing and left again. 10 minutes later our lobster soup came out and it tasted wonderful. Our waiter didn't come by the table and asked if we needed anything, but oh well ... perhaps he was busy somewhere else. After finishing the lobster and the complementary bread etc, the dishes were taken off our table and the table wasn't cleared for next course. Lots of bread crumbs all over the place, but apparently its different from NYC in relation to preparing the table for next dish.  A bit later another waiter came with my red wine and placed it in the opposite corner compared to where we were sitting, so my husband had to reach out and get it for me. Guess its the easy way, when you don't know, who the wine is for. Again it was placed on the table without a word. Noone saying: \"Enjoy\" or \"here you go\" or anything.   10 minutes later our main was ready and the Porterhouse was cut by our table by yet again another waiter. He cut the 2 sides of the bones and cut it out and placed all the meat on our plates. The sides came at the same time and we got started. A few minutes later our \"head waiter\" (don't know what else to call him, as we had so many different people on our table) came to serve the table next to us and I asked for his attention and asked about the wine, I was drinking. I had no idea what it was, didnt like it in particular, but guess thats because he hadn't asked be about what type of wines, I normally like. But he was a bit annoyed about my question and quickly just said that he thought it was a good wine for the Porterhouse and then he left again. No explanation at all and I was left irritated. Still to this date, I have no idea what wine I was drinking. Furthermore he had forgot a side dish, we had ordered and they had to bring it to our table 5 minutes into the main.  The food itself was good. The waiter who had cut the Porterhouse, hadn't done a very good job, as my husband had to cut approx. 125-150g of meat off the bone afterwards.   After we had completed our mains, we decided not to go for dessert. Had been looking forward for 2 years since our visit in NYC to the chocolate cake, but we were sitting feeling let down over the whole dining experience that we just wanted to get out of the restaurant. My husband who doesn't drink alcohol, had four times been sitting with his water glass empty too, asking if he could have some more. Thats just unacceptable.   We might only have been a party of two and the tips might not be as good as if we were 6 people dining and we might be in Vegas and I know this particular restaurant isn't living of regular customers, but holiday guests - but that shouldn't be an excuse of delivering a really really bad service. I would also understand the completely lack of focus, if the restaurant was full and the waiters were busy - just wasn't the case.  I gave our dining experience in NYC 5 stars 2 years ago. This time around its 2 stars. The starter and main dishes were fine, but the service pulled down the whole experience and I will never spend that much money dining on Strip House in Vegas again, but go somewhere else in the future.",

    "text": "TL;DR Expensive \"upscale\" restaurant that doesn't season their food, server staff are great, managers are useless, ask quickly to be moved away from drunks or you're gonna have a sexist/racist comment filled bad time.   Very unique atmosphere. Very dimly lit, \"high-class\"  dining.  Expect to pay a lot, entrees don't come with sides (adding a baked potato is $11).  Our conservative meal for two was $175 before tip.  A party beside us ordered drinks and decided to leave after looking at the menu prices.  Food was a 2/5 stars.  Steak was not seasoned enough, and goose fat fried potatoes were unimpressive. The \"ribeye\" I ordered (medium-rare) was very tuff and gristly, with no marbling, and truly seemed to be a bad NY Strip rather than a ribeye. Food took about an hour to be prepared, while there weren't that many customers in the restaurant (I believe they were trying to run the bill up by getting us to order more wine while we waited).  The service from the server staff was exceptional, hence the bump to my 3 star rating.  Servers had excellent knowledge of the menu, kept drink glasses full constantly, and removed literally every crumb from the table during the meal.  We also had a table beside us of 10 drunk New Yorker men, who cussed, screamed, made fun of women in Falsetto voices, and yelled racist comments throughout the entire dinner.  Drunks in Vegas are to be expected, but no server or manager ever asked them to keep it down or to refrain from the vulgar and racist/sexist language. (I'm sure the server was afraid of losing what should've been a $1,000-$2,000 tip from the drunks).   We wanted to love this restaurant, but unfortunately we won't be coming back.",

    "text": "AMAZING STEAKS!!! Service was not so bueno...two days before dining here, my wife and I dined at The Steak House at the Circus Circus like we always do when we visit Vegas- There, the service was exceptional, but the our steak had no flavor at all.   So, being that my wife wanted to go see Pitbul at Planet Hollywood, we decided to give this place a try. We didn't have reservations but they Sat us right away. I believe the managers name was Alex if I'm not mistaken very nice and professional man sad is that our table and told our waitress would be with us in a little bit. The restaurant was extremely packed from what I heard from one of the waiters was that almost everybody dining in there that night was going to the concert. About five minutes later we finally got our menus and met our waitress Tiffany.She either was overwhelmed very tired or just very moody that day. Again the WOW FACTOR was already ruined- but oh well- we were hungry and we were not going to go anywhere else to go dying so we had to suck it up.   My wife and I always order and share everything. We got our bread which was very good we ordered a salad we both had a beer each and ordered a ribeye steak 14 ounce medium well with a side of garlic french fries.   We actually got the steak faster than what we anticipated. The steak itself had a beautiful char to it and it was cooked perfectly. My wife and I both enjoyed our steak.  Our waitress Tiffany did check up on us quite a few times and towards the end she finally started smiling which kind of made a difference with our visit. Overall this place has amazing steaks I was very impressed I just wish the service was just as good as the steaks that's what we are noticing in Las Vegas in many restaurants now they either lack something their quality of food or the quality of customer service we spent five days in Las Vegas.   Out of all of the places that we went to go eat there was absolutely no WOW FACTOR in any of the places we dined at- it's sad that we travel so far to come to Vegas to enjoy ourselves and get pampered, but something always has to ruin it.   There are many steak houses in Las Vegas and in the surrounding areas that you can dine at.   I d rather have exceptional service and ok food than shitty service and great food. Service sets the tone immediately with you and how your total experience will be while dining.   I d give this place 5 stars,but the service ruined it-",

The drinks were great. The ambiance is so relaxing and elegant. Great decor and style. And what makes this all be so great is the Staff. Hats off to the staff.  Fabulous customer service. Very personable, great sense of humors. Everyone had a smile and made you feel so comfortable and enjoy your dinner that much more. Definitely a place to visit over and over again.",

My friend heard about their famous chocolate cake and after eating and drinking elsewhere, we came here for that cake for her. We were sat immediately. It's dark and there are old strip photos all over the walls. It's a fun vibe. Our waitress was nice and did not seem to mind we were there just for dessert. So the cake- it's called the 24 Layer Chocolate Cake. IT IS HUGE. It could feed 5 people dessert, so get ready. If you love chocolate though, you will love this cake. It is many layers (24 layers I assume, but I didn't count) of chocolate cake and chocolate mousse with a chocolate ganache. It was delicious. If you like chocolate, go check it out.",

We didn't realize that Gordon Ramsay has a long line to get in since there's no reservation. I hate lines! So we end up here in Strip House Steak House. I'm glad they took us in considering that it was full and a lot of people dining were also going to JLo show afterwards just like us.   Although they couldn't offer us the regular table since it was full.  Few high tables are the only available tables left. The waitress was very prompt and service was quite fast. The food was good too! I had salmon and he had 14oz steak. It was tasty and savory. But let me tell you that the calamari appetizer was very little, only few pieces. Overall I like this place and if ever I find myself in this casino again I wouldn't mind going back to this restaurant.",

The staff was very accommodating and attentive throughout my meal.  I starte with Rye Chai cocktail which was tasty and set a good tone for the rest of the meal.  An assortment of breads started the meal with the pretzel bread standing out.  I starte with the lobster bisque which was rich and savory.  The main course was the aged prime rib done perfectly medium rare, tender and juicy with excellent flavor.  I accompanied the meat with charred broccoli and the velvety pureed mashed potatoes.  After a second Rye Chai (it was that good), I finished with a wonderful espresso creme brulee for the win.  Another excellent steak house in sin city?  This one makes my list of sinfully decadent places to take care of my meat cravings.",

Luckily and thank fully The Strip House helped our insecurity of not finding a nice steak restaurant to go and dine at. Being in Vegas you want to splurge yourself with a nice fancy dinner after penny pushing your budget at the buffet (nothing wrong with that but it's time for something nice).  So we walked our way to the second floor of Planet Hollywood and were greeted with friendly faces and made our way into this dazzling vintage house. I love when steak houses stick to the dim lights and seductive type of look. Treat yourself to an awesome steak! I ordered the Surf and Turf (Lobster tail & Filet Mignon) and oh my gosh as soon as I put it in my mouth it melted! (That's what she said...) Steak talk here, the chef's really put their talent to the maximum because it was made beautifully where I ate it slowly to savor every bite. It had a salt and pepper cover that was very tasty. Lobster was good too but the steak sold me! Mash potatoes are must, but everything is a la carte so you can choose what ever you please. There was no room for dessert even though the sugar menu looked good. So, next time we are in Vegas, we are definitely booking a reservation here again!",

    "text": "It's an okay steakhouse and part of the Landry's group  of restaurants. I've been wanting to dine here since I moved to Vegas and sadly I have to report: don't expect service or food to be out of this world. If this is the closest steakhouse to you it'll do the job. Steaks were on the higher end of prices -$50 for an 8oz filet and the menu online isn't up to date so expect more choices on the menu when you arrive for the non-beef eaters.   In regards to service it was terrible for the high price tag of this restaurant. You expect more with these fine dining restaurants. The server forgot to bring a soft drink and steak knives until we reminded him of the missing items. There were only 3 other tables in the restaurant so not sure what the excuse was. I was certain he went home for the night because we asked the server assistant for everything and even they took awhile to bring the items.   The food was pretty average. Like i said it's part of a corporate chain. The filet mignon wasn't ground breaking and the side of potatoes au gratin was just mashed red potatoes with melted cheese on top. To make matters worse the mashed potatoes were dry and stiff. The chicken entree was pretty good and a good sized portion to be honest.   I wouldn't go back considering there are three better steakhouses within walking distance of this hotel- Mastros at Crystals,  STK at Cosmopolitan, and Prime at Bellagio- all better and comparable in price.",

Drinks took literally 20 min to come and then two small baskets of bread for 8 people. When the food finally came it was warm and not sizzling like a $65 steak should be.   The food runners had to ask each person what they ordered and one lady even asked how my friend ordered his steak temp.   I've been to this restaurant before and had a great experience, but this time was satisfactory.   The food was delicious and the mashed potatoes are bomb, but for that kind of money I expect speedy service and attention to detail.   The part that really got on my nerves was when we asked the waiter to separate the bill 2 ways so we could do separate room charges. He got all butt hurt and shrugged his shoulders. Unprofessional.   I will try another steak house on my next trip to Vegas.",

After walking around a while we were getting ready to settle for something pretty basic and then decided to search on our phones. Luckily we found this place. We were seated pretty fast and decided to try the filet and split a couple of sides: mac and cheese and strip house potatoes. The food was amazing. So good that a few weeks later when we were in town with friends we went again. Sometimes you remember food being much better than it was so I wasn't sure if the Stip House would live up to all the bragging we had done but once again everyone loved the food. We had another steakhouse the previous night and while it was great, Strip House was the clear winner.",

(The artwork didn't hurt). Being solo I decided to eat at the bar. Mark, behind the stick, was great. Wasn't sure what I wanted to drink (yes, I'm one of those people) but told him I tend toward the boozier classics. Made me a barrel aged Old Fashioned. Perfect. Figured being in a Steakhouse I should have a steak. Didn't think I could finish one if I had an app, so I just let Mark pick one out for me (he did well with the cocktail). After a few questions about what I look for, how I like my steaks (tender and MR) he sold me on the bone-in filet. I'm not much for vegetables but when he mentioned truffles with the creamed spinach, who was I to say no? Steak was tender, flavorful, and cooked perfectly. The spinach was like a savory dessert, which was good, because I saw some behemoth of a piece of chocolate cake go by, and knew my belt line couldn't handle that. Great food, and a beautiful room, but Mark is who/what will bring me back.",

First, it was pretty much the only restaurant with good yelp reviews that was able to take a late reservation for 8 people at dinner time.  Second, we were staying at PH towers and Strip house is in PH.    It wasn't super busy, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  The steaks were REALLY good.  I ordered Lobster Linguine, which was good, but I should've just gone for a steak since this is a steak house.  Almost everyone else got steaks and everyone was very happy with their meals.  We also shared 4 sides - mac n cheese, potato romanoff, creamed corn, and fries.  They were all decent although not mind blowing.   With everyone getting an entree, 4 sides and 2 bottles of wine, our bill came out to $80/person.  It was expensive, but I can definitely say that we were all happy with the experience and would come back here again.  And I repeat....GET THE STEAK!",

He is very rarely allowed to eat anything from any restaurant, as every utensil must be thoroughly cleaned, hands cleaned prior to cooking his food, after touching other foods, and distance kept between items is also a must, or something horrible could happen. We asked to speak to the chef, and he promptly came out to discuss our concerns. He was very thorough, asked what he was allergic to, and helped us choose the perfect dish for our son. He assured us that he takes food allergies very seriously, and even had a separate area to prepare his food. He was able to safely eat the squash, with a huge main dish of chicken. We ordered the steak and lobster, asparagus, and potatoes....Let me tell you, the food was out of this world fantastic! The potatoes had the most amazing flavor,  the lobster was superb, and I have never had more fresh, wonderful tasting asparagus in my life! The steak was also fabulous! By far our favorite was the potatoes.  The fact that our son could be included in enjoying a delicious meal with our family made everything perfect for all of us. If you go late at night,  put blindfolds on your kids when you walk through the casino if you're worried about risque attire, or perhaps go in the afternoon (we learned the hard way lol.)  This is definitely a restaurant worth the price, and we will be going there first if we go back to Las Vegas. If you read these, thank you chef! Compliments from our family to you!",

When we stopped by earlier in the afternoon to make dinner reservations, the earliest they can seat us was at 9:30 for a Saturday night.  No problem since we had to squeeze in an afternoon power nap from the day drinking and site seeing we did earlier in the day.  We got there and it still took a while for our table to be ready for our party of six.  When we sat down, service was a little on the slow side, but that was to accommodate our sixth person who was leaving her car with valet.  We started off with lobster bisque which my boyfriend and I shared, it was nice they split it up for us (versus being cheesy and sharing it in one bowl, lol).  I got the surf & turf dish that came with a petite filet mignon and lobster tail.  He got the rib eye which was enormous!  The side dishes we all shared were all good except the mac & cheese was a little too rich for me, but it was a hit with the others.  Overall, the service was good, the dinner was great, but the company I was with alone deserves five stars.  We walked over to the bar after dinner to continue with our night of drinking and little did I know that comedian, Wayne Brady was lounging right behind us.  Heyyyyyy....",

The cake cost $16 for a slice, but I swear it could feed a 3rd world country. My boyfriend and I both dove into the 24 layers, only to be taken down by the massive slice. Sadly, we only finished about half of it. I had plans on eating some for breakfast the next morning, but we had to check out at 4:30 a.m. to catch our flight and since I was so half asleep, I left the cake on the table.

Ordered the filet that was cooked just as ordered (medium well) and the lobster tail was excellent as well. The brocolli was made as I like it and even the drinks were great. I recommend going.

    "text": "It was our first night in town and wanted to a good steak. We were directed here by the concierge. We asked for a good steak place where you didn't have to dress up. When we got there, we found that we may have been underdressed. After a double look from the hostess, we were seated in the back.  It was about 7 PM on Friday night and the place was near empty (should have been a warning sign).  Drinks - The waiter was a bit slow to come over but when he did we ordered cocktails. Drinks were watered down.  When I asked for regular water it tasted like it came from the bottom of the ice machine. I had to buy bottled water. I later tasted local water and it was fine. Another instance where they played the customer.   Staff - The waiter was not unpleasant, just not pleasant. Other waiters there seemed to have better personalities.  Food - I ordered my steak medium rare but it came out medium. I would have sent it back but everyone else at the table had their food and were eating. I find that unless it is uneditable it makes no sense to send back as everyone would be finished eating by the time you get your food again. One of the other guys in our party ordered the \"surf and turf\" and said it was perfect, another had rib eye and said it was average. Everything is al a carte, even the sauces. We had the creamed spinach with bacon and it was probably my favorite for the night.  Everything in the place is an upsell and pricy.  I don't mind paying for good food and service, but this place left me regretting the money I had to put out.",

My friend and I felt a little under dressed, but did notice other seated parties dressed similarly. The restaurant itself is quite cozy...dark and sexy B/W photos on the walls, with some larger ones back lit with red light. The food was decent, but a medium-well fillet should have some pink and not be charred quite that much. All sides are Ala carte and as stated in other reviews, quite potatoe-centric. The service was the sticking point with me though. Sullen waiter who just repeated out the specials and then zoomed off, appetizers delivered (or tossed) on the table and no real customer service given. For the price of the bill ($200+), I would expect a little more respect for the patrons.",

    "text": "Strip House Steakhouse was everything I expected from a Vegas hotel steakhouse. I can only speak for what I had, since I ate there alone, but from the look of the other customers' faces, the entire menu is top notch. Starting with the bar, the drinks were expensive, as can be expected in Vegas, but well worth it and well made. I had a Sapphire and tonic and a glass of Bordeaux. Dinner itself was top notch. I was served an assortment of bread with butter to start. The mini- French loaf was great and the butter was soft enough to spread without any difficulty. As an appetizer, I had the lobster bisque. At first I found it a bit salty, but it somehow became more delicious with every spoonful. It had a nice thick consistency and had a good amount of lobster that seemed to almost melt on contact. For dinner, I had the 8oz filet done medium and asparagus. The steak was wonderful, slightly salty and crispy on the edges, soft, pink and full of flavor on the inside. It was served with a Bearnaise sauce, but there was a variety of other sauces available. The steak also came with a roasted tomato half and garlic off to the side. My only disappointment with the food came with the asparagus. For $8 I was expecting something a little more exciting. It was served with Hollandaise sauce on the side, but it was still just ok. It was carried by the steak rather than complimenting it. The waiter was a 10 out of 10. He balanced making sure I was ok with not annoying me perfectly and brought everything to the table quickly . My only other dislikes of this amazing place were the noise from the casino and a slightly wobbly table. I know, that is a minuscule thing, but that is what separates amazing from very good. I can't rate this place against other Vegas steakhouses because I haven't been to any others, but I would rate this in my top five ever, but probably #5.  And if it's any indication of other Vegas steakhouses, I am in heaven.",

It took some time for someone to notice we were even there but then someone finally came over.  Drinks were okay but took forever as we watched the cocktail server finish her conversation with her coworkers before she delivered our drinks.  One of them looked like a manager who we felt like was just staring at us. Our server at our table was completely opposite.  He was more pleasant and confident, but also annoying.  He was friendly but tried to make a joke after every thing we said.  But at least he was nice. Food was good, steak was delicious but pricey. It felt like our food took a long time and the place was nowhere need full.  I liked the corn sidedish a lot. We had already planned on getting the dark chocolate cake slice, but they gave us it anyway if you tell them you live in Las Vegas.  There are many other better places to eat that cost less.

I ordered the Porterhouse for two to share. It was cooked beautifully but lacked flavor and was therefore overpriced. My friend and I eat fine dining, particularly upscale steakhouses, quite often so we have some idea what steak should taste like. The lobster bisque was good but nothing to write home about. Our mashed potatoes and mac n cheese were unfairly small portions for our table and the mac n cheese was overwhelming with the truffle flavor. We were all disturbed by the harsh flavor. The mashed potatoes were bland. Sarah's salmon was cooked appropriately but the pesto fluff drowned out any real flavor. Even the bread was subpar. I would expect better from a restaurant in this price range. It was by far the most disappointed steakhouse experience the four of us had ever experience both individually and cumulatively and then to pay $400 was the ultimate slap in the face. I have no idea how this restaurant was rated so highly by other diners or culinary spectators because I think it was the biggest bogus culinery hipe of my life! Overpriced and not impressive! I would not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE! It actually put a damper on all of our moods the remainder of the night after having spent so much money and no dining satisfaction. The thought of that place now puts a bad taste in our mouths and turns our stomachs. And that is not even an exaggeration.",

There are great pictures on the wall of stars and models from back in the day.  The staff is WELL TRAINED they know what utensils to give you and take away and they do it quickly!  The bread and butter they give you is amazing.  My friend and I ate all three. My friend had the scallops for the appetizer which were really tasty its a shame that they only give you 2-3 depending on the scallops size and I had raw oysters.  I was given 3 from the east coast and 3 from the west coast.  The East coast had more natural salt to them then the west coast, but they were delicious.  I had the Lobster Linguine which has been the best that I have had ever!  My Friend had roast chicken, but he isn't choose any sides, but at the end we shared the cheese cake which was a huge piece.  We had no choice, but to share it.  Its pricey, but if you don't mind paying a pretty penny this is a great place to do so.  They give you star treatment here.",

We left to Vegas with extremely high expectations of having fun and also eating at this \"highly\" rated steakhouse. My wife and I ate here on our last night in Vegas expecting SOOO much. I ordered the bone in rib-eye and she had the fillet. We each had the same sides of goose fat potatoes and the spinach with bacon that was a special that evening. I have to say that neither of us were impressed with the steak. About the only thing I really liked was the spinach and even that was a bit over rated. The bone in rib-eye was good but nothing to slap yo mama for. The service was really good and very attentive. They were able to accommodate us although we called for reservations late due to an extreme hangover. The decor is great and the atmosphere is also fun, even on a Wednesday night. Definitely a fun and romantic setting all in one. I was not all that impressed with the food as you have already read and I would never go back to this place again. It wasn't horrible but there are plenty of other places in Vegas that have really pleased the palate. All of the above and 1 glass of wine came out to $172.48 minus the tip of course, not to bad. Recommendation: IF you go, share the sides, it's enough for two people.",

It has dark lighting with bold red walls (pay attention to the design in the wall paper, same pattern used on the napkins) with burlesque style, black and white photos all over the walls.  Same goes for the bathrooms.  Very cool looking. However, great decor doesn't make up for an overpriced, mediocre steak.  For the price I paid, this steak just doesn't measure up.  Don't get me wrong, the steak was good, it's just that I've had much better steaks for less. I ordered a 14 oz filet mignon and when I was done, my response was \"ehh.\"  It lacked any real flavor and wasn't as tender as one would expect.  This was pretty much the response from my entire party (8 people). All of the sides that we ordered (spinach, green beans, asparagus, & creamed corn) were excellent, specifically the creamed corn.  One member of my party commented that it was the best creamed corn he had ever had and we all agreed. The service was good, but it was very slow.  It took a long time to bring out drinks and then the food after they were ordered, otherwise, they didn't miss a beat.  I think the entire wait staff has obsessive compulsive disorder to some extent.  Every time one of us would leave the table (restroom or smoke break), any server that was passing by would immediately pick up the missing persons napkin and re-fold it into a triangle and place it on the table.  This may not seem strange, but the frequency of it was almost comical.  I even left the table a couple of times, just to test them and each time, I came back to a folded napkin.  To sum it up, great decor, great sides, mediocre steak.  Will I be back?  Definitely NO.  For a few bucks less, I can go a bit farther down the LV Strip to Smith and Wollensky's and get the best damn steak ever made.  Nice try Strip House, but no dice.",

I really only like filet, but I tried his steak and it was heaven! Melt in your mouth. The crab cake appetizer was awesome too.   My filet was cooked to perfection and came with lobster. The truffle mac and cheese made the meal. We ordered the 24 layer chocolate cake for dessert and couldn't eat more than a bite...it's pretty rich.  Great meal and service, great ambience too. One of the best meals we have ever had!",

The decor was really cute (old photos of 30's-40's pinup girls) and the waiter offered to let us taste most of the wines offered by the bottle, just so we could choose easier.  For dinner we ordered filets and potatoes romanoff, the mushrooms, and a daily special of baked bacon creamed spinach.  Now, we had pretty high standards, as we have eaten at steakhouses in the wynn, endore, casars, etc.  and let me tell you this place blew them all away!  Every bite was heaven!  we were way too full for dessert, but it was worth it!  We now have a new favorite steak house in town!",

Everyone loved there steaks BUT the highlight of the evening was the appetizer- the bacon salad thing- OK its NOT a salad- but its SO DELICIOUS! The best bacon I have EVER had- These GIANT slices of thick thick apple smoked bacon came out and they melted in my mouth- the flavor was amazing and i didn't want to order anything else it was that good! I did end up getting the salmon, which was great, but the bacon still lingered in my mind...in fact I'm tasting it right now....anyways if your a bacon lover you MUST have this!",

    "text": "First, I'm upset that I even had to give them one star.   Myself, my husband and 5 other friends of ours went to Strip House for my birthday dinner this past weekend while staying at Planet Hollywood.  The hotel was awesome, loved it!  Strip house on the other hand?  Absolute disappointment!    Our reservation was made for 10pm for 7 people.  We arrived at 10 but had a few stragglers so had to wait to be seated until all members were present (which is already annoying especially since they took my credit card number to make the reservation).  We were seated probably around 10:15pm; ordered as soon as our completely incompetent server decided to oblige us with his presence and proceeded to wait another HOUR AND A HALF for our food while several tables who came in well after us enjoyed their meals.  After the hour and a half passed and our plans for the night were slowly but surely being single-handedly sabotaged by this restaurant  I got up and asked to speak with the restaurant manager.  I informed her that we were sat over an hour ago (closer to two at this point), that we still didn't have our food and that several tables who sat after us were already eating.  Her response was unimpressive, at best.  She offered no real apology instead just said she'd go check on our food.  After a few minutes our degenerate server came out with our food and this awesomely inconsiderate and rude comment; \"I'm sorry you FELT like it took so long\".  No, I'm sorry, but 2 hours is a long time in anyone's world to be waiting for food you're paying $400 for.    As far as the food; I can't honestly say it was worth the money I spent on it or the amount of my life I wasted waiting for it.  I will absolutely never go back to Strip House.  I wouldn't go back if they paid me.  The service and the food were unacceptable for the price you're paying for it; I've had better experiences at Denny's.   I recommend KOI (right next to Strip House) service and food were far beyond expectation!",

    "text": "My boyfriend wanted to treat me to a nice steak and raved about Strip House in New York and said I would love it if Las Vegas location was same as New York. The waiter was awesome, but when we received our steak, it didn't taste the same. He asked for the steak to be split becasue it was a large cut. I am not a steak eater so I don't know when a cut is bad. His cut was great, but I kept chewing and chewing and eventually I gave him some of my cut to see. He noticed I was struggling, but assumed I was chewing slow. He spit his piece out and asked to speak to the Manager. He let the waiter know how he felt and was disappointed with my cut. They said it was from the same cut, but he disagreed. The Manager approaches and his response to our complaint was highly unprofessional. He comments were uncalled for when situation was explained. He said you ate it so nothing can be done about it even though he was told I wasn't a seasoned steak eater. He lied saying he came from new York location when my boyfriend mentioned names, he was clueless. He was very immature and childish and defensive. His hospitality skills were horrible, customer skills even worse and all he did was remove the side dishes ordered. We were not looking for a free meal, but something to be done to rectify serving a bad cut of steak which was a pretty penny. My boyfriend was outraged at the poor service the Manager gave portrays Strip House to be a place that doesn't care if a patron is satisfied or not. I cannot recommend this location due to his performance and will let the New York location know of our horrible experience in Las Vegas.",

We got their right when it opened so we could make the show on time.  We started off with some garlic bread with a gorgonzola fondue sauce that sent my taste buds into another dimension.  My wife had the lamb chops and I had the surf and turf. Finally a restaurant that doesn't bring the lobster out in or on the shell. Both entrees were amazing and that is truly an understatement. Kept the gorgonzola fondue as a dipping sauce for the filet as opposed to bleu cheese and it was a great accompaniment. The gourmet macaroni and cheese was also unbelievable. If you haven't been there go!!!!!  Service was outstanding but I forgot his name. Top five restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I have gone to and had the Potatoes Romanoff as well as the NY strip steak at the Strip House and I have to say, despite its outrageous price, the steak and potatoes are truly outstanding.  With the portions they give, I took leftovers home and had the best steak and eggs and potatoes I have ever had in my life. So, I was surprised and excited, after doing a search on the net, to find a couple of youtube type videos on the Strip House chefs doing their famous Potatoes Romanoff recipe; one being on the Today show. I listened and played the videos over and over until I got all the details to the letter and number.  I then proceeded to make these wonderful potatoes only to be incredibly disappointed at my results.  And, there were repeated attempts and all failures to capture the wonderful Strip House Potatoes Romanoff. One video said 15 minuets in the oven, the other said 25.  I tried both and even longer and every time the shallots came out crunchy and undercooked.  After multiple attempts, I decided to sweat the shallots a little.  This was better but not good enough.  Baked the potatoes, let them cool and rest for a day, grated and got good quality sour cream and white cheddar, and of course the russet potatoes, but none of my efforts seemed to pull it off. Funny thing is, as they say, it's easy to make using simple ingredients. My only conclusion is their ingredients are of a different caliber than what I can buy at my supermarket or gourmet market and or, they are doing something that they're not disclosing.",

This place was great, period!.   Decor: Well it indeed has a nice swanky design, dark lit, and covered with pics of nude females. The photography is awesome and no I'm not saying that because there are naked females from floor to celling. LOL If you know a little about photography you'll know these are actually nice shots. So from an decore/artistic view the place is set up very nice. It has just as much eye candy as you'll need. I guarantee you'll spend a lot of time looking/scanning the walls.  Food: Well first and foremost, I was shocked. Sure I knew it would be good but I had no idea it would be to this caliber. I tried several appetizers; used this spot as a jump pad before going to Prive (just across the way). The food was prepared great! Everything I had was delicious. And thats coming from someone who is a picky bastard. I had scallops, prawns, fondue with bread (yumm), and I had the Crab Cakes. Each item was huge! I was surprised to see scallops that big.   Overall this is a must. Give it a try!",

Crab cakes (awesome!), Caesars salad (so-so), roasted beets w/asparagus (nice flavors, but beets were paper thin!), bacon w/arugula (yum!).  I felt the waiter wasn't very attentive to our drinks, as the glasses were empty for a while before he offered us another round...really, a big pet peeve of mine.  On to the entrees.  Bone in ribeye was perfection.  Seared tuna was very generous and as expected.  Filets were spot on.  But the most spectacular dish of the evening was the truffle mac 'n cheese.  OMFG!!!!!  To die for!!!!!!  Tried the goose fat potatoes.  Just ok, a bit heavy.  Whipped potatoes were good.  Everything was satisfying, but yeah, keep dreaming about that mac 'n cheese.  I think I will go back JUST for that!  Over all, great meal, a bit pricey, and did I mention the mac 'n cheese?!?",

    "text": "Strip House has a great location in the middle of the Strip in the trendy new Planet Hollywood hotel.  Strip House's original restaurant is in NYC and I hear it's one of the best steakhouses there.  So my bf and I went there before seeing a show and it was pretty tasty.  We have been to Strip Steak by Michael Mina at Mandalay Bay and I think this is better.  We ordered a steak each and a two sides to share.  I ordered my usual FILET MIGNON med rare to med and in comparison to my boyfriend's bone-in NY strip it was just ok.  The filet had a good crust but I would have liked it to come a lil warmer or at least a warm plate but was still good.  The bone BONE-IN NY STRIP he had was EXCELLENT, great crust seasoned to perfection with a lil spicy (we always like anything with a some kick) but did not  overpower the flavor of the beef and not too fatty.  Now the sides were great additions to the meal, one of the better steakhouse we've been to with exceptional side dishes.  We ordered GOOSE FAT POTATOES (recommended by many reviewers of the NYC lcoation) which is a big ball of mashed potatoes fried with a super crispy crust.  It was good different potato side dish.  We also had their BLACK TRUFFLE CREAMED SPINACH which was richly flavored.  If you like creamed spinach then you'll love this version.  FInally, we tried their CHOCOLATE CAKE.  Definitely THE BEST chocolate cakes I've had and it's HUGE.  It is 24 layers of moist chocolate cake and rich ganache; and that's it.  No nuts nor  fruit or any other extras, just chocolate.  We did however make ours a la mode, DELICIOUS!  It's a new restaurant in Vegas so try when you're in town and please save room for dessert.  Overall it was a 5 star meal!",

Where's the cheese... apparently not on my plate. We also ordered the jumbo sea scallops with edamame succotash. This was a great dish. The sea scallops were seared to perfection and the succotash was an interesting base. We each got the 10oz filet. I ordered mine with the bordelaise sauce and she got her with the bernaise sauce. Here's the issue. She specifically asked for her steak to be cooked medium-well, no pink and butterflied. What she got was something more on the medium-rare side. My steak was good, cooked as I wanted it and tasty. I ordered the raspberry tea and she had the striphouse cosmo. Well I took one taste of the drink and couldn't take another. Have you ever tasted glucola or had a diabetes screen? Glucola is the sweetened liquid you drink for these tests and it is nasty....well in a word that describes my raspberry tea. I wanted to throw it up.   For what we paid and what we got I wouldn't go back. I like the hip vibe, but for me it's all about the service and food...oh did you see me mention anything about service? No, well that's because the service sucked!!",

I wouldn't say great or outstanding, but good nevertheless. Our sides were potato puree, which was decent and creamed spinach, skip this.  The GF ordered a bone-in ribeye. She likes her steak well-done and was disappointed to get her ribeye charred. She sent it back. A manager or supervisor did come over to check on us and inform her that it will be about 30mins. The GF didn't like her FYI tone and decide not to get the steak at all. Then the GM came over to smooth things over and comped us glasses of wine, birthday shots, and the 24 layer chocolate cake. Cake is huge and decent. Nice gesture by the GM.  Being that I chose this place for the GF's Bday and she had a lousy experience, this place gets a mix review. Overall, I thought it was a decent place, but I may consider other steak houses first.",

We were staying in Planet Hollywood anyway and I wanted to eat somewhere fancy for dinner and then place did the job. We were late for our reservation but they were about to still fit us in and sat us quickly, which they definitely didn't have to do. rThe place is decorated with 1920's models thats range of clothed to quasi nude models in way that was kinda classy but didn't interfere with your dinner either. The low lights and red interior gave it an intimate feel too.   Our waiter was a combination of charismatic and creepy, in a way that was very entertaining to me. I don't know if it was on purpose or not but either way he was very good at his job. One of my friends suggested I get the ribeye steak medium well so I went with that and I was not dissappointed! No one was in fact, not even the vegetarian! (She ordered a 2 sides instead of steak and still didn't finish everything). Probably the most surprising item was the grean beans cause they were freaking delicious. I was stuffed and could stop eating them. In fact, many of the sides that we ordered could be shared with at least one other person. They are kinda big and so flavorful, so they were also pretty filling.   We decided to get the 25 layer chocolate cake for dessert. That's right. 25 LAYERS! Again, I couldn't stop eating it and I don't even like cake that much. I had mentioned to the waiter and supervisor that was working that my birthday was my favorite holiday, so when the cake come out, it had a candle in it and Happy Birthday was written on the cake. They waiter and sup even came by and said \"Have fun on your favorite holiday!\" It was something simple and easy that they didn't have to do at all but they did. 5 stars!",

    "text": "We discovered the Strip House Restaurant in NYC about 5 years ago. When we discovered that there was a Las Vegas location, we immediately made reservations!  Our group started with Oysters and the Mixed Greens salad - both were great. The salad came in a wonderful crispy parmesan bowl.  For entrees, our group had the salmon, the ribeye and a filet. All of the entrees were better than we remembered in NYC.  All the sides we tried were incredible!  Creamed spinach, green beans, potatoes romanoff... YUM.  This restaurant is a bit expensive, but worth every penny!!",

    "text": "Level of service did not exactly match the prices, even for busy Vegas hotel standards. We had better service for a third of the price at Holsteins across The Strip and at other less expensive places. Overall, we had a good time, but mainly due to good company :)  I made reservations for my girlfriend's bday and I even received a phone call confirming the reservation and asking if there was a special occasion. They did do one thing special and that was to write happy birthday on the plate they served the piece of cake I ordered for us. Unfortunately, that was the end of the good part.  The food and service were not what we expected, and we are by no means high maintenance! She ordered the lobster linguine and almost chipped a tooth on a nickel-sized piece of shell! Our waiter, who disappeared for a while, didn't even apologize or offer any comps when I called attention to the shell, which was very disappointing. The guy who cleared our table spilled butter sauce and nearly got it on my shoe. Others at nearby tables seemed to have more engaging and better service.",

The menu is standard for a steakhouse in terms of selection and prices, but the way the dishes are done makes every item truly exciting so they deserve extra props in that department.  The presentation of every dish is impeccable.  The shotglass of cold watermelon soup to whet the appetite and awaken your tastebuds does just that--it's amazing.  The salmon with basil pesto foam, lobster linguine, and steak were all devoured.  Absolutely incredible.",

    "text": "Sign me up for the Strip House Train.  This restaurant is tremendous. I've been twice and heartily recommend it. Why?  Because of the steaks. The New York Strip on the bone: there you go, twenty ounces of mouth watering juiciness, broiled to perfection and seasoned to within an inch of its former life, generously coated with coarse salt and potent black pepper. Oh, boy, this is going to be one of the best steaks you've ever had. Sides to go with the steak: the green beans in garlic sauce -- killer -- and the onion shoestrings, made from Spanish Onions and lightly breaded, the ideal companion for your steak. And for dessert? The 24 layer chocolate cake of course. Don't be scared, the layers are thin, and the great thing about it -- it's not that sweet, more of a semi-sweet chocolate... satisfying your desire for something a post meal treat, but allowing you to also remain in the glow of  a perfectly prepared steak.  I've been to four or five steak houses on the Las Vegas Strip and this one is my favorite so far. It isn't cheap, but the best things usually aren't..",

The decor in the restaurant is truly Las Vegas with b/w photos of pinups and go-go dancers.  The furnishings were dark woods and RED walls and seats...very sensuous and sexy.  For starters, we had their lobster bisque and garlic toast with cheese fondue.  Both dishes were sooooo good.  The bisque was very rich and full of lobster flavor..one of the best lobster bisque that I have ever had.  The garlic toast with cheese fondue not too cheesy was ....ditto good.  For our meals, we had the bone in rib eye steak, lobster linguine, goose fat potatos and bacon, truffled creamed spinach.  All these items were soooo tasty......the steak was cooked perfectly.....the lobster linguine was excellent (full of lobster flavor) and the sides of goose fat potatos (like diced hash browns) and bacon truffled creamed spinach were perfect sides...filling and with unique flavors.  For desert we had their famous 24 layer chocolate cake w/vanilla ice cream.....one of best deserts we have ever had.......sooooo sweet and super tasty.  Overall...one of the best steakhouses I have ever been to.  From the sexy ambience, to the lobster bisque, steak and chocolate cake...all was just sooo yummy.  The service was also outstanding!!  No sex tonight..........I was so satisfied, I came in my pants!",

Everything we had from the tuna tartar, to our steaks & even the sides were delicious and perfectly prepared.  Next time we are in Vegas we will for sure be back here.

We started in the bar while we waited for a couple of our party to arrive, the bar tender was fantastic and very knowledgeable and made a great drink, once at our table the Gentleman who served us was outstanding! Gave us plenty of time to get settled and talk over the menu which I like, I hate when you just open the menu at a new place and they're already pushing appetizers, he came back told us about a few specials and took our order. We got the Bacon which was good but not great, a special appetizer they were doing with goat cheese wrapped prosciutto with a lil spicy kick to it which were good and we got Oysters on the Half Shell that were awesome! Entrees and Sides were Top Notch, I ate probably the best Rib Eye Steak I have ever had, 20oz Bone In, crispy char on the outside with a perfect medium on the inside! Seriously I will be back just for that steak! The rest of our party had the Porterhouse for 2 which they loved, the 8oz Filet was terrific and our dieting friend loved the chicken! The Romanoff Potaoes are very good but the star of the sides we got was the Mac and Cheese! Give me that Rib Eye and a plate of Mac and Cheese and I'm good! Anytime I'm in Vegas I will be coming here!! From Hostesses to busboys (my water was never less than half empty ) managers the waitstaff and whoever cooked my steak tonight you were AWESOME!!!",

We were promptly seated and had all of our drinks in a few minutes. One of my guests had a sever food allergy which was addresses professional and personally handled by the manager who oversaw that no allergy issues took place. Expert Job Guys! The staff was \"Johnny-on-the-spot\", nothing went undone, under served or in any way negative to upset the night. I had a crab cake which was about as good as it gets when you consider the distance from the ocean. My main course was a superb cut of perfectly cooked organic chicken with just the right sides. No complaints. 4.99 out of 5. Thanks everyone for a truly amazing time for my guests and I during my birthday dinner.",

I came on a Saturday night with some friends that were in town visiting and they were staying at Planet Hollywood. There were not a lot of people inside dining, so I was skeptical, but after everything we had, our group enjoyed our meal.  We started with the large seafood tower (would definitely recommend this for large groups) that came with an assortment of shrimp cocktail, oysters, crab legs, lobster tail, and other ceviches. Other notable appetizers included the crab cake, tuna tartare, and lobster bisque. We got a bunch of sides to share with the steaks including the mashed potatoes, string beans, mushrooms, and broccoli. Now for the steaks - definitely surprised with the quality of the steaks, but I would suggest asking them to go light on the salt - it was a little heavy for me. I got the porterhouse for two (shared it with my friend) and it was cooked a very good medium rare. The steaks also came with a roasted garlic, one of my favorite accompaniments to a steak. Finally, dessert - a baked alaska was ordered for the table to share and enjoy.  Overall a good steakhouse for those that are staying at Planet Hollywood.",

    "text": "My wife and I are in Vegas celebrating her 50th Birthday. I saw the very good Yelp reviews regarding this steakhouse so booked reservations several days ago using Open Table App leaving note regarding special birthday celebration.   We arrived on time for our 6:30pm reservation they made references to my wife's birthday. (Unfortunately did not mean anything since the restaurant does not comp birthday desserts).  So far everything is going well and were seated then ordered our meal.   We started with the Mixed Field Greens which we shared and had an adequate portion for the both of us. The Sherry vinaigrette was good.   The Main Entree meal we ordered was the Porter House Steak for two. My wife and I agreed this was the best steak we've ever eaten.   We ordered the Potato Romanoff as a side dish along with Garlic Sauteed Green Beans. These two sides were outstanding with twice baked gratin potatoes and the perfectly sauteed crisp green beans in olive oil and garlic.   Also ordered the Lobster Thermador in which the lobster that was placed back into the shell then baked again was pretty tough. I did enjoy the claws on top which were fried in a tempura batter. Advised the waiter regarding the toughness of the lobster meat but he basically ignored me and evidently did not inform management since he did not remove from my bill or make any attempt to deal with the issue. I've been to many restaurants that will remove a bad portion of a meal off the bill or workout an equitable arrangement that resolved the issue. Didn't want to cause a scene on my wife's birthday. I would normally handle these issues more vigorously if not initially heard since I'm paying for a service and want the best in return.   Dessert we ordered was the Carmelized Banana Tart which was very delicious. Of course they did not comp the dessert for her birthday but in light of the the lobster issue should have been done.   Overall the food was very good except the lobster. Disappointed they did not reach out to resolve this issue in a fair and equitable way. Hope management reads this review and contacts me to resolve this issue. I still tipped the waiter appropriately even though he did not handle my concerns properly. Only gave 3 Stars should have been 5 Star but when a business doesn't not listen their customers concerns and ignores them leaves no choice.",

What makes this place even better was the customer service. We showed up and explained to the server that we had tickets for a show and only had 40 mins until it started and asked if this was a possibility? She said no problem and we will make sure it happens with a assuring wink.   Truth be truth. We got our food which was steak and the others got salmon faster then any other place I had ever been to. Very sweet server who got a huge tip and a large thank you.  Now the steak was so large that I shared multiple bites with others and everyone wished they had got the steak. Even after sharing I still had so much steak that I was stuffed. Thickest, juciest steak ever!   Order the steak!!! Don't doubt but order this amazing steak! It is a must go to place people. Go!!!  Drinks were amazing too and the theme is not for children but adults only. The lights inside were perfect and great for close friends, spouses, or relationships.  Why are you reading this? Go already!",

We were seated in an awkward booth, I would've preferred a half booth or a table for a business dinner.   Service was excellent throughout our meal. My merlot paired well with my ribeye. My coworker ordered the special of the night which was the 6 oz. parmesan crusted filet mignon with a balsamic glaze. I tried some of it and it was ok. The meat was tender, however, I did not enjoy the parmesan which added no appeal to the steak. The balsamic glaze was nice, however, the overpowering pepper killed the flavor of the tender meat. The same with my 12 oz. dry aged ribeye steak which was overcooked and also was over seasoned. This prevented the meat to really shine.  As far as side dishes go, we ordered the split potatoes, potato romanasco, and black truffle creamed spinach. The split potatoes were overcooked and tough to chew. I really enjoyed the potato romanasco and the truffle creamed spinach which were delicious!   We were too full for dessert and had to forgo on it. Overall, food was ok. However, for the price ($310+ for 4 ppl), I expected higher quality and consistency in cooking and seasoning. I was sorely disappointed.",

Just look at the photos, the glistening steak & our big smiles say it all. I believe Striphouse has 3 locations, the most important thing about opening a location that far away from the original is consistency, this place delivers. I've eaten at 6 good steakhouses in Las Vegas & in my opinion this is the best. Besides the food, the professionalism & classic decor also hit the mark. Don't let it's sneaky location at the upper floor of Planet Hollywood fool you, place this restaurant anywhere and it will dominate!",

We were concerned about reservations for six so last minute, but they were extremely accommodating and were able to get us right in at 19:30.  They had excellent selections of meats and sides.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in guiding us through the menu.  Most of the appetizers are for a single serving which was a little odd so we had to buy several to share with the table. My partner and myself decided on the chateaubriand steak.  That's steak was a slice of heaven and I Tell you.  The lighting is dim and has a casual ambience feel there.   There were a lot of couples, perhaps first or second dates occurring throughout the restaurant.   The waiter upfront asked if there is any time constraints which I appreciated and that we were free for the evening.",

They prepare the steak with a crusty salt layer with a little spicy kick, which they will adjust. I didn't need any additional sauce, our guests enjoyed the bordelaise.  The seafood platter was tasty. I wish I could have changed some of selections to add certain items and take away from others - more salmon (fave item on the platter) and tuna fewer oysters.  The 24 layer chocolate cake is over hyped. The duo of flavors was pretty pedestrian. Given the large layer count I would expect more flavor varieties.

We ordered medium, it came out medium rare. When my plate filled up with blood after cutting two bites we had to flag someone down where we asked them to take it back and please cook to medium. Never once did any employee apologize for the inconvenience. The steak overall was dry, chewy and lacked flavor. For $102 piece of meat, this was awful. Our server was like a robot- not personable, friendly or welcoming. She seemed miserable and had no soft skills. I also ordered the seasonal cosmopolitan for a cocktail- it was okay, nothing special. The friendliest person we dealt with all night here was the kind gentleman that poured our water.

This place is top 5 in my book (CUT, Craftsteak, Binions for the nostalgia and great service, and Delmonico's are my other top spots to date.)  Started off with the jerky for an appetizer. I don't think I've ever had jerky in a restaurant, so the bar was low so long as they didn't put a Slim Jim on a plate. Guys... You have to try the jerky. It does have a lil kick to it, but I absolutely loved it.  For the main I went with the 16oz NY strip (medium.) The flavor was superb! Paired it with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts so I was in heaven. I sadly was too full for dessert even though they had some good options.  The service admittedly could've been better, but it wasn't horrible. Even though it's low lit, it's not romantic because it can get noisy (unlike say Cut.) The price was on par with what I've seen at other places so I've got no real complaints. If you're staying at PH - go here if you want steak.",

On a Thursday night, it wasn't very busy, but I made reservations on Open Table just in case, while we made our way to Planet Hollywood Hotel. They took us right in, it was about half full at 8pm. The host was very friendly and welcoming as we made our way to the table.  Our server was sweet, and the entire dinner service as a whole was efficient. Everyone was on the ball refilling drinks and clearing the table or offering assistance.   The restaurant is dark, filled with burlesque photos and a Godfather feel of dark woods and red accents.  Our food: 8oz filet minion original pepper & salt crust was perfectly cooked medium. I actually added some of hubbys blue cheese topping and it made it to die for!  For fun, I added 2 scallops, moist, and perfect salted seasoning.  Dry-aged ribeye, also cooked perfectly at medium, and very tender. Added the delicious blue cheese topping, and there was plenty to share with the other steak.  Bread basket: pretzel bread and multi-grain cranberry bread...both were good and served with warmed, not melted, butter! So much easier to spread when it doesn't come out of the freezer!  Drinks: 1 glass of Riesling from Austria; I was warned it was dry and it was the best Riesling I've ever had...not quite as sweet as the others. Iced tea, in an individual glass bottle of \"Republic of Tea.\" And the servers came by to refill the glass several times.  Potato puree to share was so smooth and had a certain sweetness to it...delicious!  But what I really saved room for was the asparagus...had some delicious creamy sauce with capers...I couldn't get enough! I will never want asparagus any other way!",

The service was good but it was super slow at times. I felt they did not have enough bar staff working since it took forever to get the bottle of wine or after dinner drinks.  The wine list was great with tons of nice selections at every price point.  I started with the heirloom tomato salad and it was so beautifully presented and tasted wonderful. For my main course I had the small filet and lobster tail.  The lobster was delicious and perfectly cooked. The filet was good I felt that they over seasoned it so next time I will definitely ask for the filet to be naked. The sides were good and large enough to share.  This is one of the better steak houses in Las Vegas and it would be five stars if they didn't. Over-season the meat and stepped up the service.",

    "text": "Oh Strip House, how I love thee!   To begin, I made a reservation for a private room for a work function with Lori C. and she was fantabulous, knowledgeable and professional throughout the process. She spent a fair amount of time helping to select wine and a preset menu but some of our guests were not able to attend so we moved to the main dining room. Lori was understanding and perfect throughout the changes.  The dinner itself was outstanding as well as the service. It was a work function so I didn't want to be the young person taking photos but the food was as beautiful as it was delicious. We shared two seafood towers and the quality was outstanding. My only complaint would be that the back servers took them away with food still on them without leaving the plates of food on the table or offering it to the diners. That tartar and those scallops should not go to waste, ever! I ordered the bone in filet Oscar style and it was....to. die. for. Cooked perfectly to medium and with the sort of flavor that doesn't need sauce! Lol And when they tell you the steak is heavily peppered, they ain't joking! Be aware if that's not your thing.   2 days after my work dinner and the convention ended I finally ate my chocolate cake and it was still good. :) I'm still shocked that I didn't know about this place sooner and shocked that they weren't busy during the convention, y'all better go so you can understand why I'm shocked. Just don't forget your wallet $$.",

We made reservations the day before (just in case). The staff is very friendly and accommodative. And let me just say, this was the best steak I've ever tasted. Ever! The char-grill on a medium tastes so good. And honestly, you don't need a steak sauce or condiment. We ordered sides because you just can't eat meat right lol. My brothers got wine but I was good with water. They enjoyed the wine. The bread was also very tasty. I'll say that the price is not like Olive Garden (not throwing shade, just saying). It's a pricey place but when in Rome, or I guess when in Vegas :-)",

    "text": "Prologue: My fiancee and I had tickets for a show at Planet Hollywood and wanted to find a fantastic restaurant to have dinner before the show.  The Plot: We began by sharing the Goat Cheese Prosciutto Rolls, followed with a 12oz Filet Mignon along with Crisp Goose Fat Potatoes and Sauteed Wild Mushrooms. This sumptuous meal was concluded with their signature 24-Layer Chocolate Cake.  The Scene: The portion sizes were very good and there was plenty of food for the both of us.  You know the meal you're about to enjoy is off to a great start when the basket that first arrives at your table is filled with a variety of hot rolls that are even better than anything you've purchased at an artisan bakery.  The Prosciutto Rolls were stuffed with Calabrian-Infused Goat Cheese, Wild Arugula, Frisee, and Shaved Parmesan and were served with a Twelve-Year Aged Balsamic Glaze. To begin with, the exceptional quality of the prosciutto was immediately apparent. The spice from the Calabrian Chile was well balanced with the chilled goat cheese and greens yet still delivered enough heat to excite our taste buds. My fiancee commented that she would have been satisfied with just this dish alone for dinner.  The Filet Mignon was cooked to a perfect medium rare (see photographic evidence below) and had been allowed to rest appropriately prior to arriving at our table. The steak also had a nice crust on it with classic seasoning. My fiancee appreciated how it was moist, tender, and pink in the middle but not at all bloody.  The Potato Croquette had great texture; firm yet tender and perfectly seasoned on the inside with a lovely and very yummy crispy crust on the outside. This was a much nicer compliment to our steak than a baked potato would have been.  Personally I enjoyed the Sauteed Wild Mushrooms most of all. The portion size was very generous and the variety, texture, and flavor of the mushrooms was absolutely outstanding; perhaps the best I've ever had.  Twenty-four alternating layers of chocolate cake and chocolate mousse topped with ganache comprised their signature dessert. One could not help appreciating the time and effort that went into creating this dessert. The piece we were served was monstrous and was easily enough chocolate bliss for 3 or 4 people.  The Rest of the Story: The serivice was excellent, of course. We arrived early in the evening, were seated at one of the best tables in the house, and were cared for very well.  The ambiance and decor were classic steak house crossed with Sin City.  The tab for the meal was very reasonable for fine dining at this level in this location.  Epilogue: We happily award 4 stars for our most satisfying and memorable dinner in Las Vegas to date.  Photo Design: by Billie Z.",

Most of there's turned out medium instead of being medium rare.   The highlights for me were the sides.  the sides were more tasty then the rib eye steak.    They have private rooms that you can reserve.  We happened to reserve one for our group.  You can still see out of the room through the glass windows.

    "text": "UGH so disappointed!!!!  For the price of this place, I definitely expected wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more.    I liked the lounge, so that place I'll probably go to again.  But I will never ever have dinner here again (unless you comped it and everything was absolutely free).  I've never seen a place charge a per person fee for splitting a meal.  (Though when the meal came out, it was portioned out for each person so I guess that was OK.  But still).  It's kind of like a Ruth's Chris, but more stuffier and less comfortable.  I kinda felt like our server was wondering wtf we were doing there since we didn't look like everyone else.  Geez.  Open up the menus and WOW.  Can you say sticker shock?  I was expecting pricey but cmon.  So with that being said, the food better match up to the cost of it.    My BF and I split the ribeye and ordered 2 sides to go with it, the onion straw things and creamed spinach with truffle oil.  Good, but the truffle oil definitely over powered the dish and it was all I could taste.  The onion straws were done just right, and provided a good contrast for the creamed spinach.  But my steak was cooked completely wrong.  I asked for medium rare.  Not well done on the exterior and raw on the interior.  That's why this place is uber dark.  So you can't look at the color of your steak and send it back for them cooking it wrong and trying to trick you into thinking your tastebuds are wrong.  Ever since then I've been cooking my own ribeyes to make up for the horrible experience.  I'm going back to Ruth's Chris.",

Not my favorite seating. A girl next to us was drunk and was very annoying. Not the restaurants fault. The waiter was very polite and sophisticated. We each had a very nice cocktail. We both ordered the special, surf and turf. It consisted of a 6 oz. filet and a 1 lb. lobster tail.  We had the pureed potatoes as our side order. It was presented beautifully. They also served drawn butter and their special steak sauce. The steak was cooked to perfection. The lobster was laid out beautifully on the plate. It also was cooked perfectly. We decided to take the cake to go. One piece is enough to serve 4-5 people. I was a little disappointed in the cake. It was to rich. Overall it was outstanding. It's not cheap, that's for sure. But if you are celebrating a special day I would suggest them highly.",

    "text": "My first night in Las Vegas last week started at the Strip House Steak House. Mark helped us at the bar and was great, my dirty martini was excellent. We had a party of 22, so we had a pre-fixe dinner.  I started with the caprese salad with buffalo mozzarella and then moved to the iceberg lettuce salad with crumbled bacon. Both were equally good. The 10 oz. filet mignon was good, not outstanding, but it was fairly good. I certainly didn't need all 10 ounces. However, the mashed potatoes were outstanding.  We ended the night with the Strip House chocolate cake with 24 layers of chocolate. This huge piece of cake was a bit difficult to split with coworkers - it would have been easier to split with friends. However, it was delicious and paired nicely with the red wine I was finishing.",

Actually found the appetizers and side dishes to be better than my steak.  Crab cake-excellent Scallops-fresh and cooked just right.  22oz. Ribeye-cooked medium-was rather chewy and a considerable amount of gristle. Not sure what i was expecting but i've made a few steaks at home that were much better....  Duck fat potato-very good! mushrooms-pretty blah  Friend had the 16oz ny steak. he was quite pleased.  Pretty pricey dinner and it just didn't seem to blow my mind considering the cost. i did leave with a food coma-hence the three stars.",

The servers were bend-over-backwards accommodating and the food was divine.  Really delicious steak and solid sides.

The restaurant was quaint and dimly lit and well suited for a rambunctious group.  Limited seating and an ample wait staff made the evenings service flow quite well.  Groups gathered at large round tops while couples ca noodled in overstuffed booths along the walls.  The food was impeccable and there wine list was complete while still showing some great hidden finds (try the Flora Springs Trilogy!).  The front part of the restaurant housed a large bar, but we never had to wait, the new Planet Hollywood Casino (formerly The Aladdin) seemed to be somewhat quiet making for a good chance for seating here without a reservation.",

So when I saw there was a steak house, why not? I love steak. I was seated first at the bar, my first impression was this was definitely a high class place, you can just tell by looking around, plus it's in a casino/resort in Vegas, it has to be right.  The bartender was super friendly, we talked for a while and since I was alone, the company was nice. It's always a good thing when the bartender talks to you because that means he cares about his job and his customers, which is why I left a fat tip at the end.  I ordered the steak and asparagus. It was amazing! The steak was cooked just the way I liked it.. medium rare, and the asparagus was fresh and tasted great. I was super satisfied when I was done with my meal, couldn't been happier.   This is a great place to enjoy a good steak, even though price is a little steep, you get what you pay for, it's vegas! Can't ball on a budget. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good meal.",

They were very nice about remaking it but its always frustrating because the timing is off with the rest of the group. They overcompensated with a really raw piece but I didn't want to send it back. My table really enjoyed their steak and sides but I wasn't crazy about their salt and pepper crust. It came with a whole clove of roasted garlic which was nice. Everything just seemed a little off to me. The sides were fine but the texture of the potatoes seemed a little gluey and the broccoli with miso butter didn't really taste like miso butter. It was also chopped into giant chunks of broccoli so we had to cut up and share pieces which was odd. For dessert, the brownie with ice cream and a chocolate sauce was very rich and tasty but the top of the brownie was so hard we were struggling to break the brownie. I don't really get the 5 star ratings, for the price I had higher expectations.",

We ordered fries as a side and they were cooked to perfection.

    "text": "Strip House Steak is nothing short of life reaffirming beef. I had a late dinner Friday night at the bar, and enjoyed every bite of my meal.   Mark, the bartender, was extremely jovial, entertaining, and offered an exceptionally high level of service. I began my meal with the scallops. The order came with two large scallops over a buttery froth with some grains and soybeans. Every bite was perfect, the slimy texture of the scallops was complemented by the crunch of the beans, and the heartiness of the grains.   Next I had their version of a wedge salad with blue cheese dressing. It was delicious, a whole chunk of wedge covered with shaved red onions, chopped bacon, and a creamy Stilton cheese dressing. It was one of the best takes on a classic steakhouse wedge salad that I have ever had.   Lastly, I had the 12 ounce filet mignon cooked rare plus. This was the crowning jewel of the meal. The steak was thick and heavily crusted with the perfect amount of salt, and black pepper before being seared at what I can only imagine was an extremely high temperature. The steak shredded with only a fork, and melted in my mouth with an exquisite texture. To accompany the steak there was a roasted garlic clove, which combined in sparing quantities with each bite of steak added an extra dimension of flavor.   Overall, Strip House Steak is somewhat of a hidden gem for being right on the vegas strip. I found it to be a little bit more reasonably priced than some of the better known alternatives, and every bit as good.",

I was a bit turned off when we arrived early for our reservation that they made us wait almost 10 minutes even though the restaurant was not full and there was clearly open seating.   I'm giving it 3 stars because we took some food home with us and after I ate it, it immediately killed my stomach.",

The steak was absolutely great... Salty char crust! Perfectly done.  I would go back if only for the tasty steak.  Scallops were also beautifully cooked & tasty. So the truth is the food was really 5 star & the service was the unfortunate part.   Our waitress was not someone who I would request or want again.  She was not attentive at all, the drinks did not arrive for more than 15 minutes.  I am happy that I did not notice her name.  Were it not for her this would be a 5 star review.",

One of my favorite places to eat when home is the Strip House downtown.  I love the decor and the illusion of stepping back in time with the velvet walls and vintage photos  I did not want to ruin that experience by experimenting with Strip House Las Vegas.    We decided to gamble and give it try in the hopes that it would not be an over the top glitzy Vegas version of a place we love so much. On first approach, I could see flat screen TV and my heart sank.  I was pleased to see that they were just in the bar area and not viewable from the dining area.  Our hostess was very gracious, asked us where we were from, made pleasant small talk and sat us at a booth.    We were greeted by our server John.  It was obvious that he has been in the service industry for many years because he was courtesy and knowledgeable not only of the menu but had committed the specials to memory.   He described each dish with his own personal experience and interpretation of what the chef was attempting to do.  John had suggested a bottle of wine which I would not usually lean towards...but the gamble was paying off already so we went with it and it was an excellent choice.  I usually don't order the specials because I am very particular about what I want and go to the places where I know it would be perfect.  In this case, John had beautifully described a bone in Filet Mignon with parmesan crust sitting atop a balsamic reduction.  The steak arrived and it was cooked to perfection and as complex and delicious as he had described.    During the meal the manager came to the table and we explained that our dining experience to that point had been excellent because of the attention to detail and prompt service of the wait staff especially our server.    John suggested and provided at the end of the meal a banana and caramel dessert which was not something I would order but proved to be outstanding.    All in all our beloved NYC Strip House experience will be enhanced knowing that each time we travel to Vegas there is a home away from home with the same quality of service and five star dining.  Well done Vegas............NYC should be proud!",

    "text": "Ok my son saw a show on TV where they went through the process of making a 24 layer cake. My son is a 'Foodie' in the making. As we were driving through Vegas, he saw the 'Strip House' Sing in Vegas and was very excited. Letting me know that this was in fact the place that served this decadent dessert! He is a pretty amazing young man, with his Sudent Pilots license, NCO in Civil Air Patrol, on the Nevada Wresting Team, high School Football Team and a National Judo competitor...So he deserved a treat (even @ $17/slice)   I called ahead and let them know we wanted to just have dessert. The person on the phone said no problem and it wasn't busy, so no need to Reserve a table. It is located in the Planet Hollywood Casino so parking was a bit rough. The casino was flat out Packed. I mean really packed. The Restaurant is located up stairs toward the LV strip.   As we entered, we were greeted nicely. There were only a few tables with patrons, it is a really large dinning room. We were sat immediately and I took the time to peruse the drinks menu as well as the dinner and dessert menu. Like any top end Steak House in Vegas, the prices were $$$. The server was very nice and attentive. The menu was huge. I think I included about 30 pictures just of the menus. Drink menus, wine menus, scotch menu, whiskey menu, Food menu,  That being said, here is what we ordered:  2x Crisp Goose fat potatoes 2x Striphouse chocolate cake  As soon as we ordered, we were brought a bread basket. There were 3-4 types of bread and soft butter in a small ramekin. The bread was really good. The kids loved the gluten free bread, so the waiter brought more. The goose fat tater, it was really good also. I thought it was fries, but it was more like a large fritter/tater tot. Delicious for sure.  Next we had the 24 layer chocolate cake. It was huge. I think the guy said each slice was around 2 pounds. My first thought was we really only should've ordered one piece. Even with this many people. The cake is filled with a chocolate custard, and then a decadent chocolate ganache frosting. And though I was reeling at the price of the two orders of potatoes costing $24, the $17 per slice cake, it take was worth every bit of it. It is hands-down the best chocolate cake I've had...Ever. And after 60 countries, I have had a lot of chocolate cake. since we had had dinner earlier, and weren't there just for dessert, we ended up taking quite a bit of the cake back to our RV.   I will definitely try this again. I cannot say that I would go so far as to spend 60 or $70 for a steak dinner. The time for eating like that ended when I had five children. But the cake, we will be back for. Or who knows, we may actually visit the original one in New York.",

(We had filet Mignon)...additionally, we had their pan-seared scallops with Eda-mame corn succotash, Caesar Salad, and Hatch Chili Mashed Potatoes....AMAZING!!

The tuna tartare was good, tasted like it had no seasoning and I personally like that however I assume the majority won't. The Caesar salad was not good, no fresh crispy lettuce and poor presentation. We did not eat it and they were kind enough to take it off the check. Drinks were delicious and I was good with one as it was large and strong. Not a bad restaurant, but I'm underwhelmed especially for this price range.",

It is all created ambiance, so technically it's a themed concept, but it does it to perfection and makes for a memorable and enjoyable meal.   Now to get to the meat of things, pun intended: the wedge salad with blue cheese dressing and crumbles, red onions and bacon was perfect and is a splendid way of waking up your appetite for the umami-ness to come. The New York strip was done to perfection with a delicious mahogany, salty crust given way to a red center, just as ordered. As a special, they had this wonderful hash brown fritter, the size of a baseball, that was crispy and crunchy on the outside with a soft warm interior. The scallop dish was exceptionally prepared, although I could have done with an extra scallop or two. The wine list is extensive, and their by-the- glass selection is diner friendly.  We had a lovely Malbec that complimented our meal well.   This is a great dinner place amidst the sea of places that are way too cheap or way too expensive.",

    "text": "Situated on the second floor of Planet Hollywood next to the Criss Angel Theatre, I came here for dinner prior to a show (NO, not Angel!).  I was seated after being asked if I wanted to be in the main dining room or the bar/lounge area.  I chose the main dining room and I was shown to a semi-circular booth in the rear with a great view of the restaurant and my back away from the door (thank you Wild Bill Hickok).  I was quickly asked about water/drinks and I was brought an iced tea.  They only serve Republic of Tea in bottles.  I was then brought a small bread basket with two pretzel rolls and two other rolls and a small dish of butter.  Checking on the size of starters--most meant for sharing--I opted for lobster bisque for a starter and I ordered the 14 ounce dry-aged ribeye with a topping of seared foie gras.  The server asked me if I wanted salt and pepper on the steak and I said yes.  After a while, a runner came to the table with a boat shaped bowl and poured the bisque into the bowl.  The lobster bisque was good but it only had a few, very small pieces of lobster.  I also had the runner add some freshly ground pepper to the bisque.  There was time in between courses which was perfect.  I was brought the steak and fries.  The steak was tender and flavorful and I liked the salt and pepper topping.  It was done a bit too much--more than the blue I had ordered.  The foie gras was excellent--the best part of the steak dish.  The fries were also good but they didn't have a garlic/herb flavor at all.  It was a large amount of food and I didn't finish the fries--opting for dessert instead of mere fries.  My server brought the dessert and after dinner drink menu and he mentioned a few things.  He also told me his favorite was the deconstructed Snickers bar.  I decided to taker his recommendation and ordered that.  It consists of a thin layer of chocolate cake with three small scoops of ice cream--vanilla, chocolate, and dulce de leche, candied peanuts, nougat, and caramel.  It was very good and a fitting end to the meal.  Service was very good with attention to paroling the table for empty sweetener packets et. al.  The room is done in red and lots of wood.  The walls are covered with photos of exotic dancers.  Quiet when I first arrived at 5:15, it was almost full when I left.  Definite Strip pricing for an OK meal.",

    "text": "Had a pleasant dinner date with a girlfriend the other night.. we had a reservation at 5:30; arrived just shy of 5:20 and we were seated riiiiight away.   Strip House is easily located on the second floor of the Planet Hollywood Casino And Hotel. It's neighbors is the CrissAngel Theater (to the right) and Koi Seafood Restaurant (to the left). I think this place is a little to dark for my dining experience, I wish it was brighter and more well-lit, but I guess that's just setting the mood. The decor and ambiance itself is not so fancy, but still considered casual fine dining. You don't need to be suited and booted, but don't come in dressing like a bum either.   Our server, Kate was cool. She provided us with off the menu recommendations and was totally chill with the fact that my gf and I were going to share a steak and sides.   We tried the 14oz NY Strip; cooked medium. Man, this steak was cooked beyond perfectly with a salt&pep seared too, and a juicy beautiful pink center! At $50+ for this 14oz, I'd say it's perfect to share between two people, easily.   Our side, was fantastic! The black truffle cream of spinach is soooooo creamy and that truffle after taste- brings a huge smile to my face. I would highly recommend this side dish. ($15).  So glad I was finally able to try this place. A decent steakhouse located in one of my favorite hotels. Check it out!",

It was hard to tell if it was one of those fancy steakhouses because it was dark and candle lit romantic ambiance but the floor made it less \"stuffy\" and the music and artwork all around. It is white table cloth and there is a bar and they have various specials. We ordered the Bone In 20oz NY Strip and the Bone In 20oz Ribeye. Both almost $60 each. The seasoning and the crust of the NY Strip was really well cooked. The RibEye has high flavors in oil and seasoning as well. Service was efficient for the most part. They recommend that the sides are good for sharing from 2-4 people. We had the $12 Mac n cheese. In my opinion, the Mac n cheese side is more so for one person, maybe two if I was nice to share.",

The only downside to this place: It is TRICKY to find.  It is within the Planet Hollywood Hotel on the 2nd floor next to the Chriss Angel theater.  Nobody in the Planet Hollywood (or mall nearby) knew where on earth this place was -- which was FRUSTRATING and also why we were late!  This place is LEGIT.  Very fancy.  Fun \"old Vegas\" atmosphere.  Moody lighting.  Great date spot, although I didn't come for a date.  :D   Their steaks are HUGE and very well seasoned.  Their sides are equally HUGE but AMAZING.  Do not delay!  Don't miss out!  Add this to your list of \"must visit\" spots the next time you are in Vegas!",

Lets talk about mouth watering. The bacon was the best thing Ive honestly had in awhile. I am a bacon lover too!! My son loved it so much we did fight over the last peice ha.   Seafood platter was amazing. I got the half order and it was still SO much food,  i cant even imagine what the full platter is like.   Porterhouse was HUGE, bone in and so much meat. Love the way it was presented. They let you see the whole peice then cut it up table side.    24 layer cake?! Yes, it was bigger than my sons head, but he went to town on it :)  Only thing is the restaurant is somewhat hidden upstairs away from the flow of the casino so foot traffic isnt very high. Great plave tho so check them out!!",

The hostess, water server and manager were also amazing.  We had the half size seafood platter. Every single thing was delicious. They have sauces that compliment each thing and whatever sauce was on the salmon needs to be duplicated here at my house.   Hubby and I had the dry aged ribeye, a side of scallops and the best potatoes au gratin. We also tried the mushrooms and asparagus. My steak was supposed to be medium rare but it came out closer to a medium, but the manager quickly made it right. Dessert was also in the plans. 24 layer chocolate cake and a deconstructed Snickers for the win.   It's definitely on the pricey side, but it's worth every penny. Take the money you were going to waste in the slots and go here instead.",

My favorite has become the dry aged ribeye.  The filet mignon is also a winner.  Well worth the price.  On the service end, blown away.  One nigh my wife was handed a Tide pen along with sparkiling water after spiling sauce on her dress.  The next night, one of my guests was handed reading glass after having trouble seeing the menu.

But other than that.....food is excellent.  They make great steak and side dishes.  Been there several times and enjoy going back.  Make reservations though...it gets crowded. More of place you want to take friends or clients.  Not really good for kids.",

Both times I ordered a New York cut and both times it was cooked to perfection.  The second time I brought my own cab but also ordered a bottle off the list.  They were appreciative and waived the usual $35 corkage... completely unexpected and very appreciated.  Service was perfect.  Oysters perfect although I was surprised we had to ask for horseradish... something which regularly accompanies the cocktail sauce when one orders oysters.  There are so many great restaurants in Vegas that it would be nearly impossible to commit to a specific steakhouse.  Not sure I can go to any other steakhouse.",

Well huh not what we expected. It was $14 for the cake and $4 more for ice cream.Not what we expected at all. Cake was blah not moist, not warm blah!!!!!! Service was blah because the waiter was in for the tip and seem not to suggest some good if they not tryed what's on the menu at all. Over all the setting is wonderful with the red settings lights.

    "text": "With a culinary and hospitality background, I've been told on more than once occasion that I'm overly critical of restaurants.  But when you're paying upwards of $75/head for dinner (app, entree, dessert, and drinks), I believe you have a right to be critical.  My 2-star rating comes primarily because of the service.  In a recent conference at the NRA Show in Chicago, Steve Carley, CEO of El Pollo Loco, said about service, \"Bad service can make good food taste bad.\"  Forgive me for stealing a quote, but that just about sums up my experience at Steak House.  It had come highly recommended, and given my background in steakhouses, and my LOVE for a good steak, I was REALLY looking forward to it.  We had a group of three on the 4th of July (and yes, I do understand that eating in a restaurant on a busy holiday isn't exactly the best time to dine, but the restaurant was not busy!), and our entrees were a filet mignon, bone-in veal, and ribeye.  I ordered my filet medium rare, and the same with the other two cuts.  The veal and ribeye come out perfect.  My filet?  Not even close.  Medium-well bordering well done.  But no biggie.  I hate sending food back, but in this case, the filet was so bone dry, I just could not eat it.  After waiting about 15 minutes for the server to come check on our table, I asked him if there was anything he could do.  I showed him the steak, and showed him it wasn't done the way I ordered it, and this is what got me: instead of simply offering to take it back and refire it, he pushed a steak sauce on me and insisted that the sauce would make it more to my liking.  Seriously?!  At this point, I just insisted that it be sent back and he woefully took my plate from me.  A couple minutes later, the dining room manager came to my table and asked me if I would consider a different cut of meat (which I expected).  I simply explained to her that it wasn't done to the temp I had asked, and that I still wanted the filet.  No argument, a simple apology, no harm, no foul.  She even brought out some more of the cheese fondue appetizer we had ordered to hold me over.  All was well for the time being.    But then the meal went on.  My filet came back as the others in my party were finishing their entrees, and it was done perfect.  But then our server suddenly disappeared...again.  I had to ask a busser for our check, and when it came, I noticed I was charged twice for the filet.  10 minutes later, after being yet again ignored, the server came back expecting the card in the bill, and I explained to him what had happened, and sure enough, he blames his manager for not taking care of it.  Really?  I wasn't even trying to put blame on anyone, just trying to take off a double charge on the bill.  At this point, I was just over the meal, and when I finally settled my bill (everything fully charged, no comp, no discount), the manager came back to my table, and totally acknowledged what had happened and apologized for everything that had gone wrong during our dinner.  She handled the situation very well, considering, and I have no problem spending for a meal whose food matches its service, but in all honesty, I was expecting my filet to be comp'd.  Given her acknowledgment of the dinner, she admitted they screwed up, but you CAN make it right.  Problems are an everyday occurrence in restaurants, and especially fine dining, but most of them are EASILY manageable.  An overdone filet is no exception. If you call yourself a steakhouse and charge more than Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, and Morton's, your service standards should be at least comparable.  Not only are these chains better, but their service is head over heels Strip House.  At least I don't get talked down to by the servers and pushed steak sauces when I eat there.  That being said, their bone-in veal is TO DIE for.  It was cooked perfectly and is the only reason I would even consider going back there.  The veal alone is the only reason I gave Strip House 2 stars instead of 1.",

Then they all disappeared for most of the rest of the meal, even had to move our own empty plates out of the way after 5 minutes.  The chateaubriand was a half ass piece of meat; I've had better taste from Walmart.  The cook likes to char the edges with salt and pepper and that made the outside of the meat inedible to myself.  All in all what a waste of money; we could have had 4 decent buffets for the same price.  The worst thing of all, going back to that pretentious atmosphere...the waiter committed the cardinal sin of not coming back and asking if everything was okay with our meal.  Even a diner waitress usually has this down.  I could stay in the hotel again, but would never set foot in this charade in the future.",

    "text": "I was here for dinner on a Monday night with co-workers because we were in town for a convention.  The decor is kind of interesting....the whole restaurant is covered with black and white pics of strippers from the 50's.  I was with a group of 6. We made reservations in advance and were sat immediately. Our waitress was very nice....but very s l o w.  Our drinks took forever and she would randomly disappear so we didn't really see too much of her.  I started with the Caesar Salad. It was your average caesar salad but it was topped with paprika croutons which gave it a little spice...I enjoyed that. I don't eat meat so I asked the waitress if they could make a vegetarian pasta for me which she said wasn't a problem.  The pasta was surprisingly delicious! It was linguini tossed in a light lemon cream sauce topped with fresh asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes and peas. It was very flavorful yet light and creamy. I loved it.  We ordered a variety of sides for the table to share: Black Truffled Creamed Spinach- a little too creamy for me but still good Garlic Herb French Fries- can't go wrong here Sauteed Wild Mushrooms- great! Sauteed Green Beans w/Garlic- excellent Potatoes Romanoff- dry, crumbly, and didn't taste very good  The sides were good, but I felt for the price they could have tasted a lot better. Two of my co-wokers ordered steak which they said was decent, but came out lukewarm. For $50 a plate I think the steak should be served hot don't you?? Anyways, I was just really disappointed in the service. Our waitress didn't pay much attention to us and everything took forever. For the prices you pay here, everything should have been perfect.  Don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",

Was given a complimentary sample of a delicious potato soup, I would have ordered a bowl if it were offered. Creme brulee for dessert was excellent. I was given a complimentary little nut-type dessert with my coffee also.   My server was a little inattentive in the beginning.

    "text": "This restaurant does not compare in any way to the other wonderful steakhouses in Las Vegas. My advice, go to Stripsteak at Mandalay Bay for a truly wonderful steak.   The service left a lot to be desired for a restaurant with so many awards. The restaurant was practically empty. While the pace of the meal was fine, our server had an heir of arrogance that was unnerving. He was not friendly and rather inattentive. Very disappointing.   After reading so many raving reviews, we started with the Gorgonzola fondue. I love love love garlic and have always thought you cannot put too much garlic on anything for my taste. However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible. I would have preferred to enjoy the Gorgonzola taste since it was Gorgonzola fondue. The garlic bread that is served with it was very tasty but drenched in butter. Again, who doesn't like butter on garlic bread? Certainly not I! But this was way too much...it made the bread soggy and greasy.   The breads that we were served were very good. One was like a pretzel stick.   For our entree, my husband and I had the filet. It was perfectly cooked, but not up to the quality that we expected based on the awards Strip House has received. We shared the creamed corn as a side dish. It was rather flavorless. Too much cream and not enough corn. They should rename it \"heavy creamy with bits of corn\". Again, a huge disappointment.   A table nearby by ordered the daily assortment of homemade sorbets and ice cream for dessert. If I hadn't seen the table nearby order it, we would have skipped it. I am glad we didn't. It was the best part of the meal. We had raspberry sorbet and chocolate ice cream. It was served in a large toile cookie bowl that had tons of fresh blackberries, raspberries, strawberries and blueberries. They were very generous with the fruit. This made for a light, refreshing dessert.   In summary, go to Stripsteak. We will not be visiting Strip House again.",

Oddly enough, the entrees were perhaps overshadowed by the fantastic sides that came with our meal - the creamed spinach, specifically, garnered rave reviews from the group - including many folks known for their meat-eating prowess, not spinach.

Upon arrival I felt that our server was too preoccupied with his other table. When he was telling us their specials and asking us for drink orders, he was glancing and looking continuously at that table next to ours (a table of about 10 bachelors). We had to repeat our orders for him to even acknowledge them. On to our food, we ordered the calamari which was actually raved about by our server, but was mediocre at best. We had the shrimp cocktail and oysters on the half shell. Both were okay; the oysters didn't look too appealing but were indeed fresh. We shared the bone-in rib eye and their filet & lobster tail dish. The kitchen had split our orders without us asking which was nice of them. We also ordered the crisp goose fat potatoes which I do not recommend, and the whipped potatoe puree which was good! There wasn't anything spectacular about their sauteed green beans and garlic either. All in all, I probably would not venture back here.",

    "text": "Although the food was delicious, we had some issues with customer service. We ordered a $70 bottle of wine. Pointed to it on the menu. When the bill came the bottle of wine we got was $115. We said we had an issue with the bill to our server he promptly sluffed us off to the manager who was bent on proving us wrong. She brought the bill along with the menu to show us what we received which was NOT the wine we ordered. We were adamant that we ordered a different wine by the same name which was less expensive. She wouldn't budge. Even after several times stating we did not order the more expensive variety she still would not budge. She ended up comping a drink but that did not nearly cover the almost $40 difference between the bottle we ordered and the bottle we received. Definitely feel as though it is the server's responsibility to clarify which bottle you are ordering if there are multiple bottles of the same brand. Left very frustrated.",

The sauce with the scallops was stellar and my gf ate a bunch of the bread with it also.  The beef jerky was better than mine and I make stellar jerky.  Then we had the twice baked potatoes romanoff and split steak and lobster.  We were amazed by the potatoes and the steak and lobster was fantastic also.  The service was fantastic and we took a piece of the 24 layer chocolate cake back to the room as we were stuffed.  I broke into it at least 3-4 times overnight and still couldn't finish half of it.  I was glad they didn't get upset that we split an entree as it is a waste for us.  The bill came out to around $130 and I tipped $30 to compensate and because the service and food was awesome.  The light music and ambiance made for a very romantic evening for us.  We both agreed it was one of the best meals we have had in years.",

    "text": "Never have I been so happy at being disappointed by the name of an establishment.  As I put my dollar bills away and sat down for my meal, I knew I was in for a treat. I had spotted a waiter bringing some food to a nearby table and damn did it look delicious.  Seriously...anything better than a steakhouse? (For you vegans it is like a great salad bar with meat instead of lettuce.)  So for starters I tried their lobster bisque. This delectable mix of Maine lobster & red pepper ravioli was a match made in heaven. Wow! Absolutely perfect...or as close to perfect as you can get with this treat. I wanted a second bowl. Of course I am a glutton, so maybe that was just my chunky belly speaking.  Moving on, I then tried some lump crab cakes that had potato salad, corn salsa & remoulade stuffed inside. I am a sucker for crab cakes and these hit the spot. Not since my visit to Baltimore was I so pleased with the crab cakes I had been given to inhale.  Then the main event.  The 20 oz. bone in (of course) New York Strip medium well. I ordered some sides of black truffle creamed spinach & sauteed wild mushrooms to compliment the massive steak.  Holy cow...literally. This blessed piece of meat was made to perfection and I surely wiped that plate clean. The 2 aforementioned sides were also great. I went to loosen my belt, but had realized I had not worn one. So instead I just unbuckled my top button. Hey I need to make room for dessert.  I enjoyed a slice of their layered chocolate cake and a cappuccino. Like a good smoke after a romp between the sheets, this sweet treat really ended a perfect night of dining out.  Do I recommend this place? Well remember those dollar bills that I had tucked away earlier? They wound up in the front pants of the chef.",

Very solid wine list with surprisingly not crazy markups (something Vegas is legendary for, sadly), we had a Ridge Geyserville and an Au Bon Climat Chardonnay, both very nice and not insanely expensive.  As a vegetarian, the real merits of these places are lost on me, but the sides were very solid and the portions were generous.  The asparagus was nice, not too loaded with butter, and the whipped potatoes were very light, if not slightly bland.  The real story here was that I tried steak for the first time in my entire life (a piece the size of a dime), really my first meat-eating experience in at least 20 years.  It was OK, I really don't know what all of the fuss is about haha I didn't run vomiting or anything.  Needless to say, happy to be a vegetarian, but now I can proudly say that at least I know what I'm missing :)",

I decided I wanted to take them to dinner - someplace that the boys would dig, and someplace I could enjoy as well. Naturally, I turned to Yelp!   What did i discover? Strip House!!  How can you go wrong with: steak and walls covered with photos of half nekkid ladies???  You really can't!  Everything from the service to the meal was exceptional! The cuts of meat were wonderful, and the boys barely grunted a word during their carnivorous devouring (that's how you know it's good!).  The wine list was really substantial - something for everyone! The waiter recommended a very good bottle of wine that I wouldn't have considered.   Some of the dishes we grazed on: Rib Eye, New York Strip and the Filet Mignon. Sides we shared: Truffled Creamed Spinach, french fries and sauteed mushrooms. ALL DELICIOUS!!!!",

    "text": "I'm very conflicted in writing a two star review for the Strip House. On one hand, the service was maybe the best I have ever enjoyed. Jasel (sp?) and later Olivia were incredibly courteous and worked very hard at rectifying a bad situation. However, some things just can't be excused no matter how nicely the staff behaves.  We went to Strip House for a bachelor party dinner and they were nice enough to set us up in a private room. The restaurant has a very cool vibe where it isn't stuffy like most steakhouses but is still very elegant. We arrived a little late and they were nice enough to save our private room for us despite our not showing up on time which was very appreciated.   Jasel (sp?) was our waitress and she explained the menu perfectly and was very professional and cordial to us. Orders were taken at the right time and the team of other staff members made sure we never had to ask for water refills or anything.  So... what was the problem? The food. I went to Strip House based on the recommendation of my Casino host who had been there 10 times and said it was incredible every time. My steak, a 10 once fillet was good but not great and instead of being cooked \"rare plus\" was cooked more \"medium rare plus\" but that kind of thing happens with so large of an order. What was NOT acceptable was a few people had steaks coming out well done or well done plus when they had ordered medium rare. The guy to my right had ordered medium rare and his steak had no red or pink whatsoever. It was cooked over well. Other issues included one steak which was completely dry when brought out and more completely improperly cooked steaks. All told, of the 11 steaks we ordered 6 were cooked correctly or at least close enough and 5 were nowhere close to right.   We had reservations that night at LAX and were already running late so we didn't have an extra 45 minutes for them to cook new steaks and to eat them so we basically all shared everything we'd ordered and they brought out maybe one or two new steaks. It wasn't the ideal was to start the evening and it isn't cool to make your patrons pass pieces of steak all over the table so everyone is able to eat.   Olivia, the bar manager, came to our table and apologized and was generous to bring us a complimentary bottle of Cristal which was VERY nice of her and highly appreciated. We knew that the mistakes took place somewhere in the kitchen and were not her fault nor our waitresses but both of them apologized and did their best to smooth over the situation. Now, none of the steaks were removed from the bill but the given the free bottle of Cristal I guess that isn't so large of an issue.   Most likely, based on my last experience, I wouldn't return to Strip House but it is entirely possible that my experience was anomalous and your experience will be better.",

No fru fru, snotty feel to this place.  Instead, it's warm, red, and with nice pictures of past glamour.  an aperitif came first that was sadly forgettable...then...the courses began.  First:  Warm garlic bread with gorgonzola fondue. Good beginning, but if I could do it all again, I would order something lighter to prepare my stomach for the incoming assault (in a good way) of hearty red meat.  A very large appetizer that was shared by two but should have been shared by three or four.  Then came the meat we were waiting for.  We had the center cut chateaubriand that was carved tableside.  Amazing stuff!  The crust on the steak not only had a nice texture, but was full of flavor.  The inside melted in my mouth.  It was juicy and cooked just right at medium rare and the thought of it is making me salivate.  We ordered a side of truffled creamed spinach which was the best creamed spinach I've ever had.  Once the spinach touched my tongue, my eyes closed in joy.  Sadly we were too stuffed to order their 21 layer cake and I blame this on the delectable, but heavy appetizer we had ordered.  Next time layer cake, next time...you are mine!",

We ordered the black truffle creamed spinach and goose fat potatoes for our sides.  Whew...very rich meal, but so delicious!  Because we'd seen the 24 layer chocolate cake on TV (which is really 12 thin layers of cake amidst 12 layers of mousse and topped with ganache), we had to try it, but after such a decadent meal, it wasn't possible for us to eat anything more.  Our waiter packaged the cake for us to take back to our room and when we were ready for our midnight snack, we dug right into a delectable, creamy and moist dessert.  We couldn't finish the cake, but I loved it so much, I actually saved some for breakfast, lol (I know, ghetto!).  Very memorable dining experience :-)",

We were there right after New Years and Vegas generally was a ghost town. Our server was this cute girl from Utah who pretty much made the experience. I want to say her name was Mallory. Super sweet, super attentive.  The chef sent out an amuse bouche which I always love. It was a soup of some kind in a shot glass. We started off with a tuna tartare app and I ordered raw oysters. If I had one complaint, it was that the oysters were tiny. Personally, if I couldn't serve amazing oysters in terms of size and quality, I'd take them off the menu. The tartare was great.  We both ordered steak. My companion having the filet and I had the surf n turf. The lobster portion was small but oh so delicious. The steaks were cooked to perfection. Some how we were tricked into ordering dessert which was this gigantic chocolate cake for two. Very good - we had to take it back to the room. It made for wonderful drunk eating at 3am later that night.  Strip House offers sexy atmosphere, good service, and excellent food for the right price. When the check arrived I was pleasantly surprised.",

We have been to both NY and Vegas, and Vegas is by far our favorite.  While it is not cheap, we have been very happy every time we have gone and will continue to go there on future trips to Vegas.  Highly recommend.",

I ordered a medium well steak and it was overcooked to well done and the garlic mash potatoes were too garlicy. The meat was a bit dry and was not seasoned well, I definitely did not enjoy it as much as some of the best steak house i been too. Service was good however and the host was very attentive.",

    "text": "There is absolutely nothing more annoying than an incompetent hostess to start off your dining experience. We arrived at Strip House right on time for our 6:30pm reservation. The hostess seemed somewhat confused, and not very friendly as we walked up. She said she couldn't find our reservation in her computer, so I showed her the email confirmation from my phone. After a few minutes she finally says, \"Oh the online reservation system must have put the wrong date. It does that sometimes.\"  Yeah right?! We are convinced that the mistake was simply hers and she was looking on the wrong date. Anyway, we got seated quickly after that, hoping that things would get better for the rest of our time at Strip House.   The dining room is very cool. Dark woods and red, very red, with black and white photos of old time dancers and entertainers. It was a full house the night we went, but it still felt very intimate, still being able to hear our own conversation without screaming at each other.    The service at our table was excellent. Our server was very serious. He maybe cracked a half a smile the entire time we were there. But he was competent, attentive and good at his job. He knew we had tickets to an 8pm show so he made sure our service was prompt.    The food definitely made up for the mess at the hostess desk. We ordered the bone-in rib eye and the bone-in NY. Both were delicious. One was cooked perfectly (medium well) and the other was slightly less medium well, but still really good.   Overall, we would definitely have dinner here again! Hopefully, their front of house staff will be better trained.",

Since we sat at a table in the bar (where we got quick and friendly service, by the bartender - as we were the only ones in the bar on a Tuesday night), can't speak to the restaurant or the rest of the food, although we've heard good things about both - but then again we heard the same thing about the chocolate cake, now about that cake...   The cake looked great and was HUGE! Five stars for presentation - but after all four in our party dug in and actually tasted it, we all let out a collective sigh of disappointment. The icing was rich and fudgey, but the cake itself, (all 24 pencil thin layers) was dry and surprisingly bland, not very chocolatety. For a cake we've seen talked about as a must eat desert while in Vegas this desert was extremely disappointing - WAY below our expectations.   The cake, a few coffees and a tea the bill came to a whopping 40 bucks plus (the cake slice itself is $14). WAY OVERPRICED and everyone in the party agreed (and we know good chocolate folks, we've been to Europe).   Honestly, we had better chocolate cake in a buffet (Le Village Buffet at Paris) during the same trip.",

I love era themed restaurants but the real star of this show was the food!!!   The Kick off: Warm garlic bread with Gorgonzola fondue!!  Incredible! Soft perfectly cut rectangles, strategically placed in on top of a layer of fondue!!!! It melts my heart just to think about it!   Then there's the fillet, cooked precisely the way I ordered.  Oh AND the sauteed spinach with bacon and truffle oil!! To die for!!!! My only complaint was the Caesar salad.  It wasn't just plain, it was sad and neglected! Very disappointing, especially for $14 a plate.  Still great meal, great atmosphere, great service!",

I also liked how the chefs brought out a dish they made to us. Made for a more personal feel. I also liked the dimly lit area which gave more intimacy to the dinner. It was definitely a positive. My cousin's portion though bothered me. For being a pretty hefty price for a surf and turf, it was pretty dinky and small. Nothing really stood out for me meal-wise. It was more the decor and more personable staff.",

All of their steak options were huge unless you wanted the 10 oz. filet mignon. My husband and I split the bone-in NY strip (20 oz) and quite honestly the only thing I could taste was salt. The steak had very little flavor and the sides (baked potato, broccoli) were equally underwhelming. Our server was efficient (although he did make several mistakes), but I wouldn't call him personable or welcoming. On the plus side the pretzel bread they served was very good. We may have just gotten them on an off night, but with all of the other steakhouse options in Vegas I wouldn't go back here.",

At some point a waiter brought us a menu and rattled off the specials then walked away. It took another 20 minutes before he returned to take our orders. At this point we have been there for about 40 minutes. I ordered a rib eye and the potato puree and my friends had the chicken and filet. When we received our drinks, they were tasty and strong so kudos for that. At least you get your money's worth for a $12 cocktail. But when the food came out they didn't bring me mashed potatoes, it was something totally different. I told the guy it was wrong and he took them. 10 minutes later our no personally waiter tried to argue with me that that was what I had ordered. Um, no dude. By the time I got the right potato side, my steak was half gone. The food was meh. The potatoes were delish but the steak was nothing to write home about. And for $100 for just me? I will pass on strip house from now on.",

I ordered the New York Strip and a side of Mashed Potatoes along with a home made Mac and Cheese. Medium rare of course, and when my Steak came out it was perfect! Juicy, with a slight pink center. The crust that was on that steak was delicious, and the sides were cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were silky and the mac and cheese was rich and you could taste truffle oil!

Fillet's were hot, perfectly cooked, wonderfully spiced and served with full head of roasted garlic.  Wow.  Can't go wrong with the goose fat fried potatoes and the 12 layer chocolate cake wrapped things up perfectly.

Yes, the ambiance and decor are impressive as expected being in Vegas, but what matters most is the food.   I ate with a large party (15+). I ordered the 10 oz. fillet (medium rare) as well as a recommended glass of their Riesling. The meat was prepared well and I did enjoy it, but for some reason I usually get an intense reaction whenever I have impeccable steaks during my first bite and I just didn't get that same reaction this time.   What I can compliment is their service. The waiter consistently made sure that everyone in our party was being attended to. We even had a situation where a few people left the table to go outside and the busser assumed that they were finished with their plates. When my friends returned they told our server that they weren't finished, and what did they do? They cooked a full meal for each of them (whatever they ordered, of course) and boxed it up to-go! So, they basically got a whole new meal for free! I don't know of any other place that would do that.   And although the service was extremely impressive, I still had to push for 3 stars because of the food. Sorry. =/",

She ended up setting up reservations at this Steak House...  As we walked in the decor had pictures of women in random places, images of different body parts and the most interesting wall paper.

The soup was amazing but, I wanted to save my stomach for the meal that I've been dying to try.   The oysters were PERFECT. Size, shape, taste, temperature, everything about them was PERFECTO. We also have the lobster bisque dip with garlic bread, which was delicious.   Main meal: Main meal consisted of prime rib, Ahi Tuna Salad, 22 oz steak (forgot which kind) and wine. FOOD was amazing. I can't accentuate anymore how great the food taste.   Service: Service was on top of my list; I've never been to a restaurant were my glass was never half full; someone was always there to fill our glasses and take away our plates.

The restaurant is dark and red and sexy and has pictures of strip teases, burlesque, and half-dressed ladies on the pole posted ALL OVER the place.  Nice touch.  The food is your typical high priced Vegas steakhouse although this place has some things going for them that others do not...the steaks were delicious (seasoned beautifully and NOT overly charred...they also came with the house steak sauce which was pretty good), the steak and lobster special was fantastic (the lobster was out of the shell already and came with a HUGE side of melted butter for overindulgence), and the Potatoes Romanoff were awesome (shareable and twice baked cheesy deliciousness).

The decor of the restaurant was very fun while also being tasteful. The booth we sat in was very comfortable, and we also loved the wallpaper that happened to match their napkins.  Service was quick and very professional and helpful. The only thing I would remove points for was being told they had a certain special (a bone-in rib-eye for two) only to be told they had run out when I chose to order that item.   Wine selection was excellent, although a bit on the pricey side in terms of bottles. We didn't order appetizers, however, the chef sent us each a shot glass of a smoked potato soup garnished with herb infused oil which was a great free treat and tasted amazing.   The steaks were perfectly cooked and I only wish all steaks would be cooked with the same crust these are. We had the bone-in rib-eye and bone-in New York, both perfectly cooked to medium-rare. The New York was surprisingly thick which allowed more of the aging flavor to come out, whereas the rib-eye featured the marbling of the meat.  For sides, we also got the goose fried potatoes and black truffle spinach. I wouldn't get the potatoes again, they only tasted like a fancy tater-tot although the rosemary was a nice touch. The spinach, on the other hand, is far and away the best spinach I have ever tasted, and likely the best side I have ever had.   We chose not to order dessert on account of having no room, but the chef was still nice enough to send us a plate of candied pecans with happy birthday written on the edge as an extra surprise for my wife.  If you want steak in Vegas, there's no reason not to go here.",

    "text": "5 stars for the service.  Our waiter was friendly and we constantly had our drinks replenished, etc.  As we should!  Considering we are at a $$$$ restaurant, I expect nothing less than extraordinary service.    I've never eaten so late at a fancy steakhouse, although we are in the city that never sleeps, so I don't know why that should surprise me.  So note, if you want to eat at a nice establishment after a show gets out or something, and it's like 10PM, consider making reservations here.  I think this would be a great place for special occasions as well, romantic evening for two who enjoy steak, inquire within.  I will forewarn you, I'm not a big beef or steak eater, in fact, I think the last steak I ate was in 2005.  My critique is on their salmon dish.  It was cooked to perfection, that is, it wasn't dry, it was perfectly moist and fell off with each fork swipe as it should.  The flavor however, was not so memorable for me.  I thought it was bland, really, and with the creamed sauce whatever it was, I still couldn't really make out where they were going with this.  So pardon me, for ordering the fish entree at a steakhouse, but even so, I thought for the amount of $ I was going to fork over, my stomach should be happy.  We tried a variety of their sides because we had a large group and could do family style.  I thought the majority of the menu was all potatoed, creamed, or did I mention potatoed?  I suppose this is typical of steakhouse sides.. but I wasn't utterly blown away by the flavor either.  I think my favorite item was the creamed spinach, though my friend argued it was overly garlicky.  But that was the only thing that actually tickled my tastebuds.   We were there for a special occasion, so our group ordered their famous 24-layer chocolate cake and I will just say they don't lie about the 24 layers.  This thing could stand in a room on its own.  I noticed on their website they say you can order this and have it shipped out to you for $100.   I wouldn't say it was THAT good that I would need to eat it again.. but it was interesting.  I think if you're some crazy chocolate-aficionado, probably more your thing and sharing is caring.  Note, I'm also not the regular 5-star michelin-type restaurant frequenter.. going to these places is once in a blue moon if any.. and perhaps I expected too much from all the hype this place was getting.",

    "text": "YUM!   The hubs took me here on Friday night.   LOCATION: Mezzanine of Planet Hollywood, next to Koi. DECOR: Very cool, vintage-inspired, lots of creepy/cool boudoir-type photos. SEATING: Wtf - no booths? Seriously, all they have are those half-table, half-booth deals where one person gets shafted because they have to sit in a chair while you relax in a booth. SERVICE: Pretty great. Water was refilled frequently, food came out in reasonable increments, etc.   Now what you really want to know... BREAD: Pretzel bread, sesame roll and regular roll type deal. Pretzel bread was the best. Whipped butter was good too.  SHOTS: They gave us these shots of potato soup with an herbal garnish. Yum. I could've had 5 more of those. Would've ordered a bowl if it was on the  menu. STEAKS: Two Filet Mignons. I ordered mine medium, but it looked more like medium well. Still it was soft and flavorful, so no real complaints. BUT! - if you don't love black pepper, tell them to go easy on it. I love it so it was fine, but the steak really had a bite to it. SIDES: Mac and cheese and garlic fries. For $10-$12 each I was expecting bigger portions and fancier presentation. The fries were just OK, kind of reminded me of Nathan's for some reason. Mac n cheese was good, very thick and creamy.  DESSERT: Skipped it.  DRINKS: Had a Cosmopolitan which was OK but nothing to write home about.  THE VERDICT: Great place to take a date, and yummy food. Quite pricey at $40+ per steak and $10+ per side. For that price the food basically meets expectations but doesn't quite exceed them.",

We ordered the oysters, which we were a little skittish about considering we're in the middle of the dessert.  Oysters were delish!  And the mignonette was perfect!  Then we got the special appetizer they were offering that evening, prosciutto wrapped pepper goat cheese.  Again, SO delicious!  The waiter shared with us that this was so popular that it might make it on their permanent menu...let's hope!  For our dinner, we ordered the Porterhouse for two and my husband could not stop sharing about how tender the meat was, he loved it!  Mac and cheese done, right!  Not all watery and saucy, and not too stiff.  Lastly for dessert, we had to get the famous chocolate cake.  Such a wonderful dinner experience.  We will be back!",

A modern, adult themed steakhouse with inflated prices for slightly above average cuts of beef. Although my steak was cooked well, the quality just wasn't there and was pretty disappointed. For $49 for a 16oz NY strip, I felt as though money was wasted. With so many positive reviews of this place, I can only hope this was an \"off\" night for Striphouse. However, based on my first impression, I will not be returning.  On the upside, our server was very sweet and attentive. The Mac & cheese was really good and the potato puree (mashed potatoes) was yum.",

I ordered the day special filet mignon medium rare and even just touching it with the knife could tell it was not. It was rare, almost blue in the middle. How this got by the chef is disappointing.   I sent it back and a few minutes later the waitress said that it won't be long it's back in the oven. Now I'm very fussy when it comes to my steak and reheating a steak that's already rested, cooled down and cut in half is not acceptable for a $60 piece of steak. Absolutely changes the texture.   I ended up cancelling the order. Surprisingly though not even an apology.   Another surprise was that my wife was unable to order any fresh juice as all they had was from a bottle or tap! Finally, not very busy and yet the seats they gave us were very uncomfortable. There were plenty of seats which had cushioning/padding.   All in all a very disappointing meal and would not recommend.",

I'm dropping a couple hundred dollars and I feel like I'm at a fast food joint with the noise.  I just don't get it. My husband had the free range steak rare and he said it was fine.

When we first walked in, the guy who led us to our table was nice until we told him that we preferred the booth, he changed his attitude, walked us back out and let another guy take us in. Then our waiter wasn't really attentive until we ordered the $250 bone in rib eye wagyu. He changed completely and started chatting with us. My mom likes to have sauce to eat with her steak, they brought out some for her and charged us $3. I mean seriously we pay $400 on that bill and you gotta charge us $3 for the sauce? I mean $3 is nothing but this kind of service sucks for an expensive restaurant like this. We saw their truffle spinach on the food channel, the chef put tons of truffle in it because \"its Vegas baby\", but i didn't see any truffle in mine. The steak was alright, I have had better and it wasn't even wagyu. I gave 3 stars for their chocolate cake! It was heaven people! But would I come back here again, I dont think so.

    "text": "Thank you, John, for making the service as spectacular as the food!!  Our meal at Strip House was the highlight of last month's Vegas trip. I was in town with my friend Matt, celebrating his 30th birthday. The staff at Strip House greeted him with a warm happy birthday and made sure that our handicapped-accessible table was ready and waiting. John expertly explained the specials, and patiently answered all of our questions about the appetizers and entrees. He delivered our food in a timely manner and made the entire evening feel so rewarding. Not only did we get a meal - we got an experience!  We ordered the burrata appetizer, which was absolutely delicious. I considered ordering another, just for my entree. I'm glad that I didn't however, as the aged dry-crusted rib-eye was unbelievable. Much to my family's frustration, I've never been much of a steak person - but this definitely changed my attitude. TJohn sold me on it, based mainly on the process they use to prepare it, and on its salt and black pepper crust.    The steak was delicious but also so large that I couldn't finish it - well worth the approx. $55.   My neighbor ordered the lamb t-bones, and thankfully she offered me a bite - they were heavenly, and at $44, a steal.   The sides are family style, so we ordered the following and shared them:  Potatoes Romanov (a meal in itself, crispy on the outside and deliciously warm and fluffy inside) Creamed spinach with truffle oil (perfect balance of flavor) A warm, buttery corn mixture (sorry, can't remember the name) Macaroni and cheese (a little bland for my taste, but the birthday boy loved it!)  Finally, we ordered Matt a slice of the chocolate cake. I was surprised when John set a plate in front of all 5 of us - turns out, we all enjoyed ONE ENORMOUS slice of this incredibly moist, layered chocolate confection. I chose this restaurant for us based on previous reviews of this cake, and let me tell you - it delivered.   Overall, AMAZING food, AMAZING staff. My favorite restaurant in Vegas. Can't wait to return!",

    "text": "Aaaaah Vegas. Home to splendid vices including great food! I was in Vegas at the time staying at Planet Hollywood. Always favoring a steak house just my luck was a joint inside properly named \"Strip House Steak House\".   Lets start with the decor...I dig it. Dimly lit with red hues and classic black/white pin up model images. Breathes a classy yet seductive vibe (unfortunately some of the pin ups are nude so not the best place to bring little joey and elizabeth for dinner). We sat at the booth facing the bar but theres another seating area behind. Vibe was laid back and quiet which I cherished. Great setting to enjoy a lovely meal and unwind whether you just lost or won at the black jack table.  The food is great! Ordered the New York Strip with Mac and Cheese. Side orders can respectfully serve 2-3 so keep that in mind. The NY Strip medium well was fixed delightfully and tasted amazing. Mac N Cheese probably the best ive had at any steak house and I've knocked out the top 5 in Houston and Chicago. For drinks had the Apple martini (nicely done) and a strawberry mojito(little lack luster, could have done without). Dessert was a soft chocolate brownie w/ warm fudge draped across it and vanilla ice cream ontop. The sensation upon eating it made me feel not too guilty about the calories it packed and I slept guilt free ha!  Service was top notch but hey with steak houses that's a must! Intend to go back next Vegas trip. cheers!",

    "text": "We really enjoyed our dining experience at the Strip House prior to seeing a show at Planet Hollywood.  We were able to get a reservation without any issues the day of the show.  We were seated promptly at a nice table in the back of the restaurant and greeted almost immediately by our waiter, Brent.  He took the time to explain the specialties for the evening and he took our drink order just as soon as we were ready, We had a couple of questions about the menu, and he covered everything expertly - we were thinking about the Chateaubriand for two, however after some discussion, that really wasn't going to to be the best option for us.  My mom wound up ordering the 8oz Filet and I ordered the filet as well, just in the larger 12oz size.   As is the tradition in a good steak house, all of the sides are served ala carte - we chose the whipped potatoes and the asparagus for our two sides; it turned out that both of these were excellent choices!    As we waited for the steaks to be cooked, fresh bread and butter was provided.  I think that we ate all of the bread before the steaks were served - delicious.  The reason to dine at a good steak house is of course, the steaks.   Both of our filet's were cooked perfectly; tender, juicy and pretty much delicious.   I've had a steak with more flavor, however this one was pretty close to the top of the class for a filet, overall.  I'd have no hesitation to order a filet here again.  It's worth noting that the price difference between the 8oz and the 12oz filet was only $8 - it would be hard to pass up the larger steak for such a little difference in price!  We also ordered both the Bearnaise sauce and the Bordelaise sauce - I had never had Bordelaise sauce before, and I was really glad that I tried it!   I tasted the Bearnaise sauce as well, however I used the Bordelaise sauce almost exclusively.     The service was what you would expect for this price point -  very professional, very knowledgeable about the menu and the food.  We never felt rushed, nor did we feel like we were missing something when we should have had it.  I did notice that some other Yelpers have mentioned the service as a weak point - this simply was not our experience.   If I had a suggestion for improvement, it's that the manager could have been more proactive about coming over to address the tables and ask how everything is going with the meal.  I actually called a manager over to compliment the food and the service - he almost seemed surprised that I had great things to say.  If the gentleman was regularly interacting with tables, maybe that wouldn't be the case.    Overall, the Strip House was a very good experience for the quality of the food, the great service and even the price paid.  It's not inexpensive, make no mistake about that - however you get what you pay for sometimes - this was one of them.",

Our server is awesome. We did 4 sides with 6 people and it was a lot.   Prosciutto- 5 stars  Oysters- very fresh 5 stars Crab cake - 5 stars  Mac and cheese- 5 stars Asparagus- 4 stars Goose potatoes- 1 star  Mushrooms- 5 star  My husband and I split a ribeye entree and that was made perfect. The price was crazy. Almost $100 a person, but the experience was nice. Probably come back and do a couples dinner.",

    "text": "I would totally give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the terrible service when we first arrived.  We'd made a 7:30pm reservation for my birthday before the Backstreet Boys concert.  Upon arrival we were told they were just prepping our table and it would be a few minutes because they were running behind.  They offered bar seating while we waited but there wasn't room,  however a high top table was.  We ordered our drinks and after 15 minutes of waiting the gal came back and said it would be another 5-10 minutes because the table still wasn't ready.  We explained we had a concert to get to so time was critical.  After 5 minutes they sat us at a table that had been prepared and vacant the entire time we were there.  It was clear we'd been lied to and I was not happy!  Luckily enough our waiter Ricky was top notch,  the food was fantastic and the service was unbeatable.  I had the  shrimp cocktail and a ribeye both were A+!  They then brought me the best birthday cake ever and we still made the concert just as the band took the stage.  All in all it was fantastic,  but I'm still under impressed with the hostess!",

I have been to a lot of steak houses, from very expensive to the chains, and expected much better.  Our group of 6 arrived at 6pm with not many people in the restaurant.  Drink order was taken quick and the food order was shortly there after, but it took 45 minutes to get our dinner.  No special food order and as I said the place was not busy.  I asked the manager, or person in charge, if 45 minutes was a standard wait and he replied - \"one of our guest ordered their steak well done so that is what it is\".  The response sounded crazy, but it was also delivered with a I really don't care attitude.  The steaks were marginal at best and had to send back the \"charred broccoli\".  Our bill for two came out to be around $185 - not worth it.  With all the options in Vegas, this place should have done better.  Will not be back.",

    "text": "An absolutely excellent meal. From the service, to the ambiance, to the food...everything was top notch!   We went here for Christmas dinner this past December. It's our new Xmas tradition to go out to a fancy dinner just the 2 of us on Christmas night. I was a little worried when we first arrived, as the hostesses seemed very LA-hostessish, and the decor was very red and very dark. Although the hostesses looked LA, they were very pleasant. When dining outside of Los Angeles, I find the service experience to be so much more tolerable and deeply rooted in customer service. The waiter and the bus boy for our table were both outstanding. Attentive, friendly, and on top of everything.  The food was some of our favorite food in Las Vegas so far. Everything was decadent and delicious.   Everything we got was a highlight, hopefully there's enough room to write about everything!   The drink I got was so different and tasty! I got a chocolate martini, but instead of vodka or gin, it was made with Patron XO tequila that has a bit of a coffee flavor, but is definitely tequila. There is Godiva chocolate liquor in it, and the rim is covered in chocolate covered bacon crumbles. OH. EM. GEE. AMAZING! The bread basket that each table gets comes with some amazing breads, but the star of the basket to me were the pretzel bread rolls. It was like eating a big, plump, less greasy gourmet soft pretzel with butter. I could have eaten tons of them.   For our appetizers my husband got the Oysters which were spilt into East Coast and West Coast Oysters. He loved them and couldn't believe he was able to get such fresh seafood in the middle of the Las Vegas and all of its lack of bodies of water!  I got the Roasted Bacon, with arugala and russian dressing. Holy wow! I can't even put in to words how amazingly spectacularly delicious and rich that dish was. I just can't. All I can say is, if you even remotely like bacon...GET THIS APPETIZER!!  The steaks were cooked perfectly, and as tender as butter. We were very pleased.  We got the potatoes romanoff and garlic green beans on the side, and both were amazing as well.   We got a wonderful bananas foster tart for dessert. Although we were stuffed, we couldn't stop eating the dessert. Like everything else that night, it too, was amazing!   I highly recommend this steak house. I know there are a lot to choose from just on that block of the strip alone, but I promise you will not be disappointed if you choose this one for your next amazing Las Vegas meal!",

That will be one regret I will have to live with forever...get the bacon app.  Four huge slices of bacon.   Started with bread service witch was nothing special.  Go the dry aged ribeye.  Was amazing. One of the best pan sears I have ever had on a steak.  Crisp and seasoned, tail trimmed well, just perfect  Way better than other steaks I have paid way more for.    Delay with the sauces.  Got the steak first then was a waiting  for sauces and sides.  They brought out our sides, steak sauce and peppercorn sauce.  Both delicious. were missing the bearnaise.  Said the chef was making a fresh batch.  When the bearnaise came out it was perfect.  Fine diced tarragon instead of leafs.  Not too thick not too thin.   Sides, got the mushrooms-ok and the crispy duck fat potato- good.  Baked alaskan-ok meringue was good but ice cream was too hard and just a small slice of frozen cake on the bottom.",

As far as steakhouses go in Vegas, this place was really a lot better than I expected. We had reservations on Memorial Day around 5pm and there weren't many other people in the joint at that time, which made it feel very personal.    We ordered the scallops for an appetizer and they were cooked perfectly. I did not try any of the bread selections as I am gluten free but the pretzel looked very inviting.    For the meal, I had the aged Ribeye and sauteed mushrooms. My buddy had the 12oz Filet and steamed broccoli. The steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly. The only real suggestion that I have for them would be to add creamed spinach, but that all depends on whether or not you enjoy it.   The service was great, they were always there to refill our waters and etc.   The price was a bit high  but then again it is Vegas and a up-scale steakhouse.    Overall I thought the place was very solid and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a steak in Planet Hollywood.",

I am one of those man's man guys that is too stupid to figure out where something is before just randomly looking...and heaven forbid I ask anybody.  But I digress.  I ate here because of the cake...believe it or not.  Yeah the zillion layer chocolate cake was good and they had to amputate my legs from too much sugar yada yada yada.  If you go here for the cake then you miss the point.    The steak is amazing.  Other restaurants may be able to cook a steak perfectly like the Strip House, but they do not have the same seasoning.  It tasted like a salt/garlic blend of seasonings that enhanced the steak to a point that it was unlike any I have had.  I would be able to tell you more about the seasoning if I could have seen it in light...why is it so dark in here?  Decor and atmosphere reminded me of a place that is nice and dressy, but also a place where a major mob hit would have taken place.  That somehow appealed to me.  If you see some old guy in a nice suit in a dark corner then they are probably planning some point shaving scam or hasseling the teamsters.  But what am I saying?  Every corner in this place is dark...every inch of this place is dark.  Well worth the visit.  You will feel right at home if you just came out of the optometrist....good steak though.",

Our waiter promptly greeted us and went over the menu.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which was kept chilled at our table, which was nice. My boyfriend and I ordered the porter house for 2, and a couple of sides. Our steak was cooked perfectly, and the truffle spinach was delicious! Had we had more room, we would have tried dessert, but we were stuffed! Prices are high, but it is a steak house, so that being said, prices are not out of line for the service and quality.",

Near the end of our meal we complimented him for his serving skills and he told us it was his first day serving alone.  We were shocked he was a True pro and made our experience at the restaurant an unforgettable one.  We also complimented the manager Ken on the classiness and attentiveness of his staff, especially and he was friendly and grateful for the compliment and gave us some history on the restaurant which was a nice touch.  I highly recommend trying Strip house when u are in Las Vegas.   We found out they have one not far from home so we plan to check it out someday.",

    "text": "Wow. I realize sending a vegetarian into a meat palace isn't going to turn out well...but, the meatatarian was with me and he wasn't impressed either.   Decor - great decor, great theme, standard dark, red, plush steakhouse. The staff was aloof at the door and the waitress was as well.   We were 20 minutes early for our dinner reservation so we were going to have a cocktail in the lounge which they didn't direct us to, and then the waitress forgot our drinks.   A manager noticed and fixed the issue however, that was just plain sad. It wasn't bumping- our reservation was for 9pm. Let me say that the choice for this spot was ease of access only as we stayed at PH this last trip.   We were sat a decent table, a round booth that was comfy and lent us a great vantage point for people watching.   The waiter was fast, knew the menu and to the point. We were missing out on a return round of drinks.   I ordered a Beefsteak tomato salad, we ordered shrimp cocktail and calamari to start. DH ordered a fettuccini - lobster fettuccini.   All tasted AWFUL. Calamari was rubbery, cocktail shrimp were actually jumbo prawns that weren't deveined, tomato salad came as a scalped tomato with some cheese on top. Pasta tasted mushy and the lobster was chewy.   Luckily we weren't too hungry because we didn't finish any of it - but we also didn't complain.   Pricing was out of control - even for a steakhouse. Mortons/Hy's is far better quality & service for far less.   Wouldn't head back here for love or money - nothing nice to say.",

    "text": "Strip House is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in Vegas, however I just don't know if I'd return.  Everything was cooked very well, our service was on the spot, and the ambiance was posh and comforting, but I just didn't get the WOW factor.  We go through the motions with our server (tap or bottled) and let him know tap is fine, order two glasses of wine, and were served bread.  All very standard in fine dining restaurants, blah.  Upon the arrival of our wines, we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops (can't remember) and a caesar salad.  We continue on the order our entrees, a 16 oz. NY Strip and a 10 oz. filet mignon.  We also ordered three sides: whipped potatoes puree, potatoes romanoff, and black truffle creamed spinach.  Our first courses arrived in a timely manner.  The salad was fresh but wasn't the best I've ever had.  And as far as I know with the seafood, it was decent, nothing to rave about.  Shortly, after finishing them, our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly.  The NY Strip was juicy and flavorful!  And even though my filet was cooked medium (the way I wanted), it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor.  Our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the \"heavy\" side.  My favorite being the whipped potatoes puree.  The spinach was very rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Though I don't recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party.  The potatoes romanoff was rich as well, with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion.  Again, I wouldn't recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four--too much food!  Strip House has a beautiful, luxurious red interior, which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district.  There are tons of artsy, burlesque'ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls.  For those of you who are dining alone, they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games.  Be aware there is music spinning.  However, the music is of a modern retro beat, that is very easy to listen to.  Somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant, since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s-40s.  This is definitely a restaurant to be seen in!  But like I mentioned above, the food just didn't give me the WOW factor.",

When we got there, there was no greeting which they professed they would do and stated that's what they're known for. No greeting. We ate dinner and two tables next to us had birthday greetings. Disappointed to see this and seeing husband see all this. Waiter spoke with a \"matter of fact\" tone. No warmth. We ordered dessert hoping for redemption. Nothing. I think had there been no call day before dinner stating how they would excitedly greet we would have been fine. Better off not hearing that and just ate they wonderful food. Not good service for a so called fine dining price.",

We ordered drinks and appetizers, and the food came before the drinks. The ordered the house cosmopolitans, made with KetelOne Vodka. But were all agreed the drinks were too syrupy sweet, and had to be sent back. I ordered 1/2 dozen Fanny Bay raw oysters. One oyster was a good medium size, the other 5 were were no bigger than my pinky fingernail, and should have never been put on a plate. We expressed our concerns to the manager, who was only mildly understanding. I feel they should have at least comped the cocktails, but we did not ask for that. Yet, it may have made our dining experience a bit more enjoyable, but no adjustment was made. We still left 20% tip though, but will not be returning. A $150 bill, including tip for 3 cosmos and 3 appetizers. The calamari and a prosciutto appetizer were good though.",

    "text": "WOW!!! So glad my husband wanted to eat here! Unfortunately neither of us actually got a steak, but what we did get was amazing! The hostess was very friendly, our waitress was very attentive and patient, and the entire wait staff was always around to help us out without standing over us. We were sat in a coveted corner booth, which was a really great surprise. We were greeted with a Watermelon juice and Mint  \"shot\" (I don't remember what the waiter called it) as a welcome from the chef, which was followed up by a selection of bread and the largest ramekin of butter ever! Paula Deen would be jealous lol.   For our first course, my husband and I shared the most delicious crab cake of our lives! I was not feeling so great at this point (heat stroke?), so I took it slow, but I think it worked out in my favor lol. I got to taste all of the elements of the crab cake and really savor it, it was so good! The mustardy potatoes they paired with the crab cake were a bit intense by themselves, but paired with the crab cake they were really good.   For our main course we both ordered the Crispy Skin Organic Chicken Breast. I know, why come to a steak place for chicken?! Well my husband was all set on a steak but changed his mind last minute, and as I said I was not feeling so good so chicken seemed like my best option when I ordered. So glad we ordered that dish! My husband ordered his chicken with crispy onions and I ordered the garlic fries. My fries were a little over done (it cost them a star), but my husband's crispy onions were amazing! Not greasy like onion rings - very light and delicious. And they served the chicken with a chicken au jus which made it that much better. Sadly we were too full to try the famous chocolate cake, but there's always a next time!   Overall a really great experience! The best part was that there were no kids in sight! I know it's Vegas, but omg we saw kids EVERYWHERE! It was nice to have an adults only restaurant for once! We will definitely be back for the cake and some of the sides!",

The net result is the same and it will be warmer!  First of all, they ask for your CREDIT CARD to place a reservation for four people. I asked why and they said they would charge me if I didn't show up. Okay. So have a fake credit card handy when you call. In my case I \"messed up\" some numbers and they never said anything about it.   We get there and the place is fricken freezing and empty. Glad they would have charged me for ditching a table when I would have been preventing absolutely no one from using it had we not shown.   The waitress was frigid. I don't know if it was the extreme cold (it was seriously unbearable in there), her first day, or just her marching orders (be as stern and unapproachable as possible- and above all: no fun), or perhaps she was just having a bad day... But she was not in the mood for any bullshit. You will order. You will eat. You will die. Not necessarily in that order.   Food was okay at best, cold when it came out (I wonder why??). Plus, the food is outrageously expensive and you get very little of it. Any review you read about \"my meat was cooked to perfection.\" Get over it, I cook my steaks to perfection on a $99 grill every time at home too so we're not exactly curing cancer over here.   A lot of people confuse pretentiousness with good food, and I found the whole atmosphere to be misleading. You're at planet hollywood, on the strip in Vegas, and here you have a restaurant with a silly name taking itself way too seriously.",

I was not disappointed!  The ambiance was fantastic! Very classy looking and intimately lit. They have tasteful pictures of pinup up models illuminated perfectly all around and it is very red in the restaurant. Someone proposed across from us and I think it was a great setting to do so!  I had oysters, the bone in NY Strip, and the chocolate cake with a double shot of espresso. Others in my party had the filet mignon and the boneless NY strip steak.  We shared the goose fat potatoes, warm garlic bread with gorgonzola fondue, black truffle creamed spinach, garlic herb french fries, and mac & cheese.  It was a bit pricey but being a great steak house right on the strip it's what we expected to pay. I will definitely be returning for a steak here when I go back to Las Vegas!",

Casual and cheap or dressy and no so cheap! Well this was the place! I only gave it four stars versus five due to the cost of this fantastic dinner! Yes, it was fantastic! I have posted a few items that we had. First of all, the waiter was exceptional! I think his name was Scott, but wouldn't swear to it due to alcohol consumption! He was extremely helpful with explaining the menu and what would best suite each of our appetites. Love the chic decor with the red vintage feel. We had a corner booth style table that was private and allowed for intimate conversation. I felt that the food portions were overall generous. Especially being a high end steak house. My favorites were the Maine Lobster Linguine and Lobster Bisque (Picture that is posted doesn't do it justice!). Obviously I am a lobster fan! My girlfriend had the surf and turf. Again, there was lobster involved! Her steak was cooked perfect for her and she is picky! We had the Baby Iceberg Salad. Always one of my favorites and they didn't miss a beat with this one. Broccolini was nice, but the Black Truffle Creamed Spinach is the best ever! The waiter recommended the perfect wine to pairing with our entrees. I am now on the hunt for one of the wines to purchase by the bottle locally in the Phoenix area.  Highly recommend Strip House Steak House! Budget accordingly. It is well worth every dime! I also feel like they would go the extra mile if you had a special occasion going on. Just call ahead! Perfect place for a celebration of some sort!",

Great unique-flavored char on the outside and cooked to a juicy medium rare.   Normally sides dishes can be throwaways but I liked all 3 we got: wild mushrooms, green beans and the Strip House potatoes (definitely get these)!  We got there kind of late, so by the time dessert rolled around we were the last people there. We decided against it, but the staff never made us feel rushed at all.",

I highly recommend the Buffalo Milk Burrata which was fantastic pairing with the balsamic and creative squash. We then ordered a 40 Oz tomahawk rib eye served table side which is out of this world. Our other guests ordered the lobster pasta, white asparagus and potatoes Romanoff side, all which they claimed were also very appetizing. The evening dinner service ambiance is amiable. The location is fairly hidden on the level above the casino in the planet hollywood, and my only suggestion is if you didn't know this is a steak house, the sign visible to guests on the casino floor just reads \"strip house\" implying it might be something different frkm a restaurant.",

Timing: we were seated at 7:40, did not get our order in for a while, it's not until 8:49 that we got our foods in (party of 8). Service was pretty much non existence.  Price: bone in ribeye was $56 at minimum, side orders comes separately. 1 crab cake (regular size) for $20. Ordered the surf and turf (filet mignon + 1 lobster tail) for $62. The only reason we came here is because they weren't busy on a Saturday night and could seat us within 15 minutes.  Overall the taste of the steak was okay, fresh lobster. But the time we had to wait plus the pricing is what will keep us from coming back.",

Much of the food was delicious, but the bread might have been the best part of the experience. When service is rude, short, and ignorant of the customer obviously its much easier to do very poor work and/or miss things.. such as details of an order, etc. This part should not be missing as it throws off the experience of the restaurant. I watched and listened as many complained of the same bartender being awful in one way or another. I'm sure her tips suffered as did many customer's experience. The ambiance here is pleasing and enjoyable; the steaks and service are.. no joke.. the worst of any supposed \"high end\" steakhouse. Much worse than any I have been to in what seems like a decade actually. I love and live for great meals and this one really, really failed. I promise you, this is absolutely not a premiere steakhouse. Do not come here if you're expecting to get your money's worth with a delicious meal or be taken care of whatsoever. I feel bad for them. Mastro's, Larsons, blahblahblah... any other place would have at least corrected the error. Lol. The last mistake and one that will not allow repeat customers and perhaps the people in those person's circles. Farewell forever awful \"steakhouse.\"",

Located on the 2nd floor of the main casino Planet Hollywood . It has a very nice dark ambience inside surrounded with Hollywood legends red seats . Service here is fantastic and very prompt . I like the way they bring you pretzel bread and little cheese bread rolls with room temperature butter simply amazing.  The Menu has a perfect simple choice of prime steaks on the menu. I had the 8oz fillet cooked at a perfect medium rare with  instant taste orgasams accompanied by broccoli and mushrooms was the perfect side . I'm getting hungry as I'm writing this and want to go back they do have a amazing chocolate cake which I highly recommend you try. If you're looking for that perfect steakhouse which is quiet dark and very relaxing look no further strip house at planet Hollywood is the spot",

Right down to where the animal was raised and how it will be prepared. We prefer restaurants that keep the experience simple. And that was our experience last night. Simple. We arrived and were promptly seated. We were offered a very extensive menu presentation. Every single question we had was thoroughly answered by our server. And the plates that were brought to us were exactly how they were described. We ordered the ahi tuna and chateaubriand. There wasn't a chewy bite on the plate. Sashimi grade ahi and an extremely lean tenderloin. We will definitely be returning!  Too many times people only leave negative reviews. In our case I have no issue taking time out of my day to commend an exceptional employee. Our server was Billy. I suggest you add his name to your future reservations.",

However, they cooked her streak to her expectations which in in itself is a miracle. We also ordered some sides which were large enough to share and delicious - asparagus and Strip House potatoes.  Our server Ricky was very knowledgeable and friendly. He asked if we were going to a show and I said we had one at 9.

Oh, AND the mac and cheese was superb.   The ability to have such high standards and consistency from NYC to Vegas is really a nod to management as well.    Server.  Bus.  Chef. Host.  Bartender.

The service and ambiance was so amazing and went over expectations especially after walking around the planet hollywood casino and miracle mile mall. There were 14 of us so we got a nice private room which was really cool. Pretty much everyone in my family all shared the meat order for two people and then got a few sides which made it cheaper. Being I don't eat meat I got a tomato and cucumber salad which not only was stunning but amazing. The cream of spinach and mac n cheese were also a hit. The meat plates were also beautiful and carved in front of us which added for a nice little show if you will. For dessert we mainly got the fudge brownie and the 24 layer chocolate. Both very rich and sweet but so darn good. Cake was so massive let me tell you. Overall, I would highly recommend to anyone- even a non meat eater. Not to mention we had the most adorable little server who seemed to just about everything.",

The prices are fair for the quality, and the service. A must every time I hit the Strip.",

I was staying at Planet Hollywood and didn't want to roam around the casino floor with the chaos that is Vegas.  I decided to walk into the strip house and sit at the bar.    The bar tender was great - attentive but not overbearing.  While sitting there eating and enjoying my meal, a man walked up to the bar and ordered a slice of chocolate cake to go. GENIUS!!!!  Stuffed from my meal and cocktail...I simply didn't have room for dessert - but took a slice to go as well. As it was my first time ordering the cake, I had no idea how friggin' humongous the slice would be.  It had to have weighed at least 3-5lbs.   OMG. After one bite, I wished I had taken three or four or five to go. HEAVEN. I love chocolate cake, and the 24-layer chocolate cake at strip house is the best ever. I guess you can share the ginormous slice, but that's just silly. This is one indulgence worth the calories.",

The only negative was the coffee which came out tepid but of course they made it right with a fresh pot. Both the steak and lobster were cooked to perfection and the crab cake was delicious with the wasabi based sauce. I recommend this for a special dinner since you probably won't get out for less than $200 for 2. It's worth it.",

    "text": "We went to Strip House, but we did not have a great experience. The service was slow and it took a while to get our food. We ordered the Lobster Bisque which was not very good. It lacked some flavor. For our main entree we got the Fillet Mignon which was soft and very tender. The only problem I had is that the crust had a lot of peppercorn which made the dish a bit overwhelming. We also ordered the Tuna dish. I personally enjoyed that dish a lot. The Tuna was perfectly cooked and fresh. For our side dish we ordered the sauteed mushrooms. They had a good flavor, but they were very average. For our final entree we got the Chocolate Brownie. The portion of the dish was very good for sharing. However, I was not impressed with the flavors. The brownie was a bit cold and the flavors were just ok.  Overall, I would most likely not come back to this restaurant. The strip has so many great restaurants that it's easy to find a restaurant with better service and delicious food.",

They have these French fries that are fried in duck fat that are soooo addicting!   So I am a huge fan of their rib eye steak it is sooo juicy and made very well with just the right amount of char.   My wife normally gets the filet which is well seasoned that she really likes.   We also tried the porterhouse one time which was also very flavorful. I think I still like rib eye more than the New York's strip but not by much!! Really recommend this place!  Have fun everyone!",

Sides were also not prepared as well as expected. Charbroiled broccoli with miso sauce was not cooked enough and I love my veggies barely cooked/grilled/steamed.

I had calamari as an appetizer and I have to say it's the best calamari I've had.  Absolutely excellent.  For my \"entree\" I ordered side dishes since I just can't eat steak.  My aunt had the filet and enjoyed it.  I had mac and cheese (good), asparagus (good) and strip potatoes (good).  I would honestly come here again just for the calamari - it was that good!",

My guests said the fillets were good, but once they had a taste of the ribeye they wished they had ordered that.  The bread service and wedge salad's as well as the soup were all very good. This place feels a little out-of-the-way when you're walking the strip so maybe that's why they weren't crowded Because the steak certainly rivaled anything I've had in Vegas before.",

They have old time models and pin-up style pictures on the walls, the restaurant is dimly lit, and the red accents pop! This is a very \"sexy\" and possibly romantic restaurant.   The bread on the table is actually pretty good. I have a piece of the cheese topped bread and the pretzel bread. Both very good. For dinner I had the 8oz filet Oscar style and a side of twice baked potatoes. The steak was very good but it had a strong seasoned taste to it that isn't \"standard\" when you order a steak. I also felt like more Bearnaise sauce could have been given since I paid $18 to make my steak Oscar style. (I didn't say anything though) Finally, the twice baked potatoes were delicious and they give you enough to share.  Even though I was so full after dinner, I wanted to try dessert so I had a couple bites of the raspberry sorbet. Delicious and a very pretty presentation.  Overall, this is a nice steakhouse, just not my favorite in town. If you're seeing a show or at Planet Hollywood to gamble, this is a good choice.",

Not sure if it was because of the dark fancy ambience or the nice smell every time I walked by the restaurant.  It was our last night in Vegas and were sick of eating your typical quick dinners so we decided to eat at Strip House which was in our hotel.  Upon arrival we were seated right away and our order was taken right away.  Waiter was super friendly and quick to serve us anything we asked for.  My steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  No complaints what so ever as even the sides were cooked to perfection.  Now lets talk about dessert.  We ordered the 27 layer chocolate cake that was apparently featured on the Oprah show at one time or another.  I was like whatever its chocolate cake how can you go wrong anyways.  Cake was served and for those of you that know me you know that im not a huge sweets guys but let me tell you this cake made me change that quick.  The slice of cake was HUGEEE.  We could not finish it we had to bring it back to our room.  All in all I know that the steak houses are everywhere but let me tell you this.  If you are not going to try the steak at Strip House then you MUST try the chocolate cake.",

The taste and texture of the bread is great.  The fondue is creamy and mild.  We all enjoyed it.  The house bread basket comes with three types of bread.  I only tried the pretzel bread, but it was excellent.  The others seemed happy with the other two options.  I chose the 8 oz. filet for my main course.  It was prepared as requested, medium rare.   The meat was tender and tasty.  The seasoned salt and pepper crust gave it added flavor and texture.  We ordered a couple sides.  The Potatoes Romanoff were tasty with nice contrasting textures.  The others tried the Steamed Asparagus and told me it was good.  They have diverse options for wine.  They also offer some unique mixed drinks.",

Skip the capaccino not spelled correctly but not prepared as well as everything else. I love the crust they put on the steak. Did not use a sauce.

    "text": "If I had the ability to give 6 stars, I would.  What a great place.  We were on our way to Jeff Dunham next door and told them that.  I don't know if that had anything to do with the promptness, but lightning fast service. Started with some apps....the lobster bisque and the stuffed prosciutto....fantastic!  Entrees: bleu cheese crusted Wagyu ribeye and the surf and turf, (filet and lobster tail)......off the hook!  One thing that I do not order out very often, is a steak. Mainly because I can cook one better than I usually get served. However, the ribeye was well trimmed and had a great crust on it.  After my dad had removed the lobster meat from the tail, a guy was right there to grab the carcass.  As for the sides.....potatoes Romanoff and the mac and cheese. I like mac and cheese about as much as I like eggs benedict, I will get it about anywhere just because!  Well, as much as I loved the truffle mac from Gordon Ramsey's Steak.....this place was better!  (Sorry Gordo)!  Very creamy! (An adjective I don't like to use)  ....but it was!   The service needs a column of its own....  The waiter was cool yet very knowledgeable, 2 thumbs for that guy!  All of the table assistants were impeccable too.  The restaurant was elegantly dark and decorated in a roaring 20's look.    In a nutshell, if you have the scratch to go for about a buck fifty a person for supper, do it!  That was with a $100 bottle of wine.",

We started with their special bacon appetizer, Rockefeller Oysters, and Salmon Cake. I was all about the bacon. Holy crap was it ridiculously good.   For my entree, I had the special bone in filet with black truffle and parmesean and everyone else had a variety of other dishes including the NY Strip, bone in Ribeye and Lamb Chops. So... freakin... good. We shared our sides family style which was great advice from our server because we ordered six. Figured one per person... we were gluttonous. Mac and cheese, potatoes romanoff, asparagus, creamed spinach, goose fat potatoes and the GREEN BEANS. YESSSSS. (The sides are huge by the way, you don't need to order one per person)   As if we didn't have enough ( we took dinner home), we ordered the 24 layer chocolate cake, banana tart, and creme brulee. Guess which dessert we had to box?   Fantastic meal to a post Valentine's Day triple date.   Ps. Blaze's Cosmo. Do it... do it.",

Can be flexible with different type of dinners (ie romantic, business, etc. ). Noticed some nice private rooms. Not your typical stuffy steakhouse. A tad on the noisier side. But all in all, nice vibe.  Service: for the most part, it wad pretty good. We were seated right away when put party arrived. When another friend joined us late, a seat was quickly added. Our server came right away. However, service started slowing down as the restaurant got more business. We actually had to flag someone down for the dessert menu. Food came out at a decent pace.  Food: was pretty good. Highlights for me included the seafood combo appitizer (2 jumbo shrimp and jumbo lump crab meat). Loved the crabmeat (2oz). I got the dry aged ribeye (medium rare) and it was a tad over cooked to a medium. Still very nice flavor. Friends really enjoyed the salmon (not sure i would ever order salmon at a steakhouse). Best sides were the mac n cheese and the bacon cream of spinach. That spinach was phenomenal.  Value: typical high end steak house prices.   I would visit this place again if i was staying at PH",

One of the guests at our table got the half order of the seafood plateau.  It's an impressive looking dish and crammed with seafood and shellfish served on crushed ice.  I was totally loving the bread basket (lots of variety, all very tasty) since I'm not a huge creepy crawly seafood person.  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass for my main.  Seriously, one of the best fish dinners I've ever had, and I live on Maui.  I eat and serve fish for a living.  The Sea Bass was served on a bed of Jalapeno Potato Puree with a red wine sauce.  It was so delicious that I only gave my boyfriend a single bite.  I usually am much more generous in giving him tastes from my plate, but not with this dish!  He ordered one of the many specials offered: the dry aged ribeye.  It was a tad overcooked, but still incredibly juicy with a killer rub.    All steaks were served a la carte (minus the bulb of roasted garlic on the side of every steak--such a great idea and oh so delicious.  I had to school the table on how to remove the garlic cloves and spread them on each bite of steak, or eat them on their own if you're a garlic lover like me), so we ordered a few things for the table: the signature Strip House Potatoes (twice baked potato gratin), steamed asparagus with Bearnaise Sauce, and Mac & Cheese.  Do yourself a BIG, BIG favor and order those potatoes.  AH-MAY-ZING.  To die for.  Mouth watering. I wish I had some right now.",

Cons: Away from the crowd and scene! haha The private room also had plasma mounted so you could watch any showing of your liking.    Food: - Ribeye: Perfect portion, very tasty and lots of flavor.

We took the bachelor out for a good steak dinner. What guy doesn't like a great steak? A Birkenstock wheat grass eating fool that's who. Luckily, the man of the hour isn't one.  And neither am I.  When we walked in we saw a film crew concentrating on a table. We sat down and the wedding party behind us told us it was for the Kendra Show on E! (the exclamation mark does not denote excitement). If you're a fan of the Kendra show on E!, you might see my big old noggin' in an episode. I won't watch it, because honestly, I don't like her. She's too Barbie-ish and annoying. Holly Madison was in the room as well, and anyone that dated Criss Angel sucks at life anways. There is only one woman that can pull the Barbie look and that woman is Pamela Anderson. But I still prefer Kirstie Alley, so I'll be watching her show instead.  Besides, I'm sure the producers will edit out my B-Boy routine I did just for them.  That's the last time I pop and lock for the cheering crowd.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AT_xDv2Lm5K7VtER1fp-SA?select=FSBVi6TEcwKXhbEN8H_V6w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/AT_x...</a>  (notice the sad face emoticons. my microsoft paint skills are off da hook!! nah mean?!  geeyuuuuuhh!)   So like the bunch of turd burglars we are, we all ordered the same cut of meat. The always popular filet mignon. I prefer a ribeye, but for some reason or another, I choked under the pressure of the lights and cameras (because they turned their attention to me of course). I didn't know if I wanted to flex for the camera or throw my shoe at it. So I ordered a filet. We all took turns choosing accompanying sides because we're lame. The steak is as good as you'd expect at a place like this. The only sides that stood out to me were the green beans and sauteed mushrooms. That other fancy shit failed. The crispy goosefat potatoes that I chose were not a hit at the table. That's what I get for picking something with a fancy name.   So if ya catch me on your LCD holla if ya see me. Ya dig.",

We asked for John S. again as our service on our 1st visit as I mentioned was amazing.This 2nd time was no different. We both had the NY Strip steaks again and they were excellent!! Although we ordered our steaks well-done, they still packed alot of flavor and were very juicy. The crust over the steak was perfect and the accompanying garlic cloves with each bite made for a very flavorful bite each time.  We both had caesar salads to begin with which even something as small as a salad taste great. I had the garlic herb fries and my wife a baked potato.  Of course we had the 24-layer chocolate cake again and couldn't finish it between the both of us. I'm not really a sweets or cake lover, but I always enjoy that cake.   The entire meal was great and John was on top of every detail throughout our dinner, as always. Not sure of our next trip back to Vegas, but when we do we will keep requesting for John. Thanks again and see you guys again hopefully very soon.  A definite must try and visit, well worth the money.",

A few good things - the dining room is pretty cool....kinda chic but with a traditional \"steakhouse\" feel.  The wine list is pretty good.   There are better in Vegas for sure, but you can find a good bottle.  Tables are nicely set with pretty bread plates and butter knives.  No bread brought to table.  I looked at other tables....didn't see any bread.  I asked the server about the bread plates, butter knives and \"no bread\".....server said customers have to ask for bread.  I asked server how the customer was supposed to know they had to ask for bread....server said it was a new restaurant policy.  This whole bread thing makes restaurant feel cheap. I had the 8 oz filet....it was average.   Quality of meat was average.  Many better options for a great steak elsewhere in Vegas. I spoke to manager after meal.  Disappointing visit.",

Mini ciabata rolls are great very fresh they give you three cranberry, garlic cheese, and sourdough maybe. Strip house margarita it would have been ok but I forgot to tell them not to salt the glass (my fault, but ruined the drink for me) honestly I expected better drinks from a high end restaurant in Vegas French connection was made perfectly Caesar salad wonderful dressing anchovies were present and the croutons were delish nice cheese and garlic addition, fresh cracked pepper rounded it out  Lobster Bisque I've had better and the portion of lobster left so much to be desired and was pretty disappointing for the cost Crisply Scottish Salmon 5 stars! (The picture I've attached is of this dish) it was amazing and beautifully presented  14 oz steak, my dinner companion said it was well worth the $54 price tag     The above mentioned meal was $175 with tax and tip, we were in Vegas enjoying ourselves so why not but I think Morton's and Flemings are better (I don't eat steak so that opinion is based on seafood, drinks, and side dishes)",

Service was very good though the wait staff could be a little less attentive to be honest.   Every course was very good and though pricey, it was worth the cost. My major negatives would be the dark lighting could be improved and they pack tables in to get as many customers as possible, a pet peeve of mine.  Would definitely go back to.",

    "text": "Dinner for two was an ok, decent experience but at the price and with all the other steak house options in Vegas, I wouldn't go back. Everything was a little underwhelming. Nothing was terrible but nothing was amazing either. Bloody mary's were insipid, like tomato juice with a dash of tabasco. First appetizers were Lobster bisque with  Israeli couscous and the scallops. The Bisque was very good, rich full flavor but the couscous was at best a distraction. It didn't add anything good to the soup. One scallop was amazing. It had a deep heavy char and full rich flavor. The other scallop was ok but not nearly as charred or as good as the other. Had the one not been so good, the other would have probably been fine. You could not look at the plate and not notice the glaring difference in how the two were cooked, but it was still delivered to me mis matched. We split a caesar salad. It was good but way over dressed. The croutons were seasoned with paprika and distracted more than they complimented. Too  much cheese too.  Steaks have an odd crust. It's good and tasty but not what I expect on a quality dry aged steak. Felt like camouflage.  It just wasn't for me. Also, the steak was not evenly cooked. One end was a little more done than the other.  Au Poivre sauce was rich and tasty. The NY Strip Oscar was good but a little undercooked, the crab portion generous and well executed. Sides really bothered me. Truffled creamed spinach and Potatoes Romanoff were just so over the top  that the the main ingredients were totally lost. The spinach could easily have been any leafy vegetable or even news paper. It was just a thick rich gooey overload of cream and truffle overkill. Same problem with the potatoes. Just too much cheese. It was cheese on cheese on cheese covered with melted cheese.  The famous 20some layer chocolate cake looked amazing and the very top layer of chocolate was really good. Otherwise it was dry and heavy. It's a giant slice for 2 or more people to easily share but it's not good cake at all. It's a lot like one of the giant cake monstrosities at Cheesecake Factory or a similar chain. The wine was excellent. They have a \"bucket list\" of wines by the glass that I plan on returning for but I'll just have that at the bar. I don't think I'd eat there again.  I do get the whole steak house experience and LOVE a decadent over the top meal but they lost track of flavor and balance along the way.",

    "text": "I visit Las Vegas quite often both on business trips and for vacations, I've eaten at many different restaurants, and due to the outstanding service I received from my cocktail server I can now say that I will definitely be coming back every time I visit. The service was absolutely top notch, I now know why Vegas is #1 in customer service. It is because of gems (no pun intended) like Crystal that make my stay enjoyable. I had dinner at the lounge and wanted to order a steak and I didn't know what to pair it with, Crystal told me told to try the dry age rib eye and to pair it with a wente cab. Wow does she know her stuff, not only was the pairing spot on, There was never a moment where I found myself needed anything that I would have to ask for. She made sure my wine was never empty. Needless to say because of my wonderful experience I had to give the restaurant and especially Crystal a lovely review.  Thank you Crystal you are one in a million!",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here Sunday evening. Strip House has a sexy classic steakhouse feel. We were seated in the corner booth with our backs to the bar. The restaurant had seven parties dining and we were all crammed toward the front of the restaurant - I never understand why that is. Service was terribly slow to start. It had us concerned, but thankfully once the large group beside us was served it improved. Our waiter was attentive the rest of the meal.  We snacked on bread while we looked over the menu. After making our selections, we were brought an amuse bouche of potato soup. It was smooth as silk, but it had the starchy potato taste. It puzzled my palette... in a good way.  We had a crab cake to start. It was nicely presented, with lots of crab - it'd better at $17. It was pretty good, but I prefer them spicy. My husband had the rack of lamb and I had the filet, we shared a side of their Romanoff potatoes. The steak and lamb were both very good, juicy and tender with a nice crust. The chops were the second best we've had. Aureole remains at the top. Frank enjoyed the potatoes, but they were too sour for my liking.  We skipped dessert. We were pleasantly full. The check came to $125 before tip. It was a fine meal, but spendy. Still, I'm glad we gave it a try.  Photos were added.",

    "text": "I'm really conflicted about this place..I expected so much and left with really dry steak pieces still stuck in my teeth.  We went for dinner at 9pm on July 4th and the place was half filled..not a good sign.  Our wait service was alright.  However, we ordered goose fat fries which the waiter forgot or didn't hear my husband when he ordered it.  Nevertheless, we asked about it and it ended up coming during the last part of our meal.    Now let me get to the steak.  We ended up sharing a 28 day dry aged rib eye.  On the advice of the waiter, he said to order the steak \"medium\" with pink in the middle vs \"medium-rare\" which he said would mean that the steak would still be dark pink and cool in the middle.  BIG MISTAKE!  I don't exaggerate when I say that the steak was TOUGH as cardboard and it had to literally saw through the steak to get a piece off.  Also there is this extremely salty and peppery crust on the steak that added to the dryness to the steak.  Also, the goose fat potatoes were also very dry with a tough crust around it.  Interesting enough, that was also very salty.  The only saving grace is the truffle creamed spinach.  This dish is delicious!  My lasting memory of this place is salty tough steak that was stuck in my teeth on the way back to our hotel...not pleasant.",

I didn't say anything last night so as not to alarm any guests but EWW. They have to know these huge nasty bugs are in this restaurant as we were there only 2 hours!!",

    "text": "We were here for the famous Thuy Nga Paris By Night 106th episode recording and show.  For those not in the know the show is the longest running Vietnamese American music variety show famous the world over...among the Vietnamese and Vietnamese diaspora. Enough of the cultural/history lesson.    My girlfriend had an excellent idea of spending our time at the Planet Hollywood early so we would not have to fight with about 7,500 other people who were going to show up at the same time crowding up the casino parking lot and valet so we went there about 3 hours prior to the show, she played some slots, I walked around scouting the place making sure we knew where the entrance to the show was.  We initially wanted French but couldn't find it on our smart phone that there was one at the Planet.  So we settled for a steak joint which I was not too excited about since I have high cholesterol but do enjoy my steaks. But as Californians recently deprived of foie gras my girlfriend was aching for some but oh well.  We should have researched it better before we left the house.  We were probably one of the first 2 couples there, we came in before it opened so we had to wait outside a bit and took pictures. Decor was very nice and elegant.  A bit dimly lit.   She ordered a black cherry martini recommended by the waiter (wasn't that good but made a great pix with the GF that is still a screen saver on my phone. Oh, check out my profile picture, that's the big ol martini being mentioned). The waiter recommended a good slightly sweet white wine (which I like since I don't like my wine dry) as I knew we were heading into a seafood meal.    We selected the full platter appetizer. It came with a spread of cold seafood and included oysters on the half shell, clams on the half shell, a couple of small pieces of king crab or something like that, very flavorful poke tuna/tuna tartar, seafood ceviche (too darn tangy) and I am sure shrimp cocktails. We also decided, wise choice by the GF, to split an order of the Chilean sea bass (I know, endanger this and that...look, it's their fault!...if Chilean Sea Bass didn't taste so darn good they would not be in danger of extinction, just kidding of course, but this is the first time I ordered it in over 4 years since my grandmother's 85th birthday so I am not arching over with guilt). Oh, we also ordered the creamed spinach with black truffles as a side...which we could in no way finish but it was great.  We managed to go to a steak house and not having to order the usual steaks so I was really happy about the alternatives.  But I think cholesterol count-wise I lost the battle to the creamed spinach because who knows how many sticks of butter was in that decadence side. It was that rich (and delicious) but after a while you couldn't eat any more.  I am rating this a bit low because I didn't like the fact that the waiter made me feel like I under spent. He was constantly trying to up sell that it would not be enough food then visibly disappointed when we did not want desert. Hey dude, we were stuffed and we had a show to catch, cholesterol to maintain and my weight to watch. =) He did manage to recommend a good white wine and the creamed spinach.",
