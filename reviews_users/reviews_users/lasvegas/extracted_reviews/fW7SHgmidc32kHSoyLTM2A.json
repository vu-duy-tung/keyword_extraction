But they are a bit salty. I got my order to go. The establishment is pretty small and was really full and busy when I visited. The service to get my food was quite quick. Didn't have to wait long at all.",

The place is a little small and surprisingly hard to find, but signs posted en route made it much easier. The decor is minimal and very American Country, it felt cozy. I ordered chicken fried chicken and my boyfriend got an omelette. The staff was completely on their game. My drink was never empty and the minute I pushed my salad plate aside it was picked up. The food was just perfect. I felt like I was eating at someone's southern grandmothers house. It was fresh and homemade tasting. I know that sounds odd but it's True. Like they made everything from scratch the minute I ordered it, no frozen or cheap leftover flavor that most restaurants have. You must try this place!",

I felt as if we were a bother for even arriving, but hey what the hell it only took 15 minutes to take my order after I had to seat myself and family...forgive me for walking into your establishment!  We were not even greeted...see my picture of how they address you walking in!  Food was bland and equivalent to Denny's with no real difference in taste.  If it wasn't for the bad service this pace would have gotten a 3 star review and that is generous.  Took 20 minutes to get the check and the nicest person working here is there busser.  Poor kid is setting the standard for what the impression should be.  I will never return to this establishment and hope others won't be lured into this hole in the wall establishment who doesn't care two cents for there patrons.  AVOID!  It is also very difficult to find so don't waste your time!",

Their toasted bun that comes with your entrees is amazing. My family fights over it. Their battered potatoes has this delicious seasoning on it. Highly recommended.

Unfortunately, the food doesn't merit that, as the food was better then you would expect. The truth is the service was so horrible that if the food had been flawless I would still give them two stars.  From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were treated as though we were a definite burden. Our waiter (who may have also been the cook) was put out by every request.  He was cold, rolled his eyes consistently, and was extremely short.   The bus boy attempted to do a good job, but it was clear he was burnt out. The only positive thing I can say about our service was that our food came out correctly, and the waiter was competent.  At the end of the day if you only go to restaurants for sustenance and service is irrelevant to you then I suppose you might enjoy yourself. If you care about receiving good, friendly service I would highly recommend going elsewhere.",

It is family run and the owner employs young teenagers to wait on the tables so she can stand in the kitchen and curse loudly. I happened to grab the booth right by the kitchen because the others were full so I got to hear a lot. I ordered biscuits & gravy and the biscuits came out hard and the gravy was cold. I sent it back and it was better the 2nd time, I hope without a special surprise. Their pancakes are delightful, remind me of my daddy's. I am rating more on nostalgia and the variety of comfort food they offer. Other than that I wouldn't tell my friends about this place and I will pray over my food every time I happen to eat here.",

I don't mind paying a little more for quality food, but they lessened their quality and increased the prices.

    "text": "Zero stars!! I really wanted to like this place,  since it's down the street from my house. If you want to be treated as a nuisance to the wait staff, this is the place for you!  The boyfriend, daughter, and I walked in.  There was one table in the whole place and there were 4 people waiting inside by the door.  Waitress was sitting backwards in a chair (very professional) next to the only existing table talking to them and still didn't acknowledge ANYONE for at least a full minute. Finally she comes over, scoffs, grabs a hand full of menus, doesn't say a word and walks away to a large table. She looked back, seeing our confusion as to what she was doing, and she said \"aren't you all together?\" She took the 2 separate couples to their tables, then walked us over to a booth, still not saying a word, threw down the menus, and walked away. Had she not already been talking when we walked in, I would swear she was a mute.   Eventually, a dude that I assume is a busser, came over and said \"What do you want to drink?\" And asked us if we wanted to start with a cinnamon roll. Bf said yes.  Finally receive our drinks, and cinnamon roll, for which they gave us no appetizer plates so we could share it, and the waitress asked \"What do you want to eat?\", basically barking at us, without even asking if we were ready.    Took forever to get the food, and throughout our whole meal, we got to hear the loud, obnoxious conversation between the wait staff and the table next to us. Obviously they were regulars. Never got checked on and food was absolutely disgusting. Bf had pancakes, my daughter had kid's mac and cheese, and I had a veggie omelet. None of us ate even half of our food, that was $40 for BREAKFAST! We couldn't leave fast enough and will not be returning. Had a stomach ache all day from the food.",

It tasted like the average French toast. Except it was closer to the cold side. My eggs were really dry. It was really weird. I don't think I've ever had a dry scrambled egg. Maybe they were sitting while the rest of the food was being prepared. Whatever is was I didn't eat the whole thing. My girlfriend ordered a fruit platter and it was really wet. I have no explanation for it either. I am usually very supportive of small businesses and family owned businesses but in this case I rather go to Denny's! I really don't even know how this place is a four star. Definitely doesn't make sense or maybe I caught them on a bad day? I would not recommend this place unless you are starving and your are too lazy to drive far or cook anything.",

We stood at the front for at least 10 minutes before any employee acknowledged us. We got a table and were seated. The person who sat us seemed to be grumpy having a bad day. They didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  We got our drinks, the person spilled the orange juice and looked at us like it was our fault. We had to ask if we could order. Once we ordered, we got no acknowledgement until I asked for a refill.  I asked how long our food would take at about 40 minutes of waiting. I was snapped at because they had too many orders from the bar. This should not be our problem. We didn't go to the bar next door. It took about 50 minutes to get our food. I was really looking forward to it. The bacon crumbled every time I bit into it. Not really what I like. I can go on and one about what I didn't like. The sausage was pretty over cooked.  My wife ordered French toast, which was very good.  Overall I felt like I was disturbing everyone's day by asking for anything. I won't be returning here.",

I think the only other establishment in this center is the bar next door.   So I ordered the 2 pork chops with scrambled eggs, hash browns, biscuits and gravy.  Yes thats right folks, this is all part of the order for $12.79.  The biscuits & gravy was very good and the gravy was nice and thick.  Definitely not bland, but not the best I've had either.  The pork chops was the main feature here.  It was boneless and juicy.  It's nice that I didn't have to cut around the bone.  Grilled and seasoned with pepper and salt.  The has browns was nothing special.  But good though.   One thing to keep in mind is that when you sit down, the server will ask you if you want to get started with a cinnamon roll.  Just remember that this roll is not complimentary and costs $2.99.  I wished the server would have explained that to us.  The way he said it made me think that it was complimentary.  Too good to be True.  It smelled great and fresh out of the oven soft, but not the greatest and definitely not worth $2.99.   If you plan on getting their sweet tea or soda, keep in mind that it comes in a very large cup.  But the good thing is if you don't finish it, you can ask for a to go cup.",

We could tell because they had 3-4 random bits of veggies included, and the chunks were seasoned perfectly even.  My wife described her sausage patties as being \"soggy\" (frozen food cooked incorrectly)   Our server Jason seemed angry the whole time.  At the end of our meal he literally dropped a basket with the check and said \"there you go\".    Again...

When placing our orders we each were asked with our meals... again, as if the things being asked were included with the meals.... Bacon or sausage? White or wheat toast? Pancake or hashbrowns with that. The prices didn't seems un-usually high so I was suprised with the amount of food we would be getting.   Come to find out when we get the check that it was $83. I was expected around $50-55    They charge $5 each cinnamon roll and all the sides were additional cost. Say its my own fault for not asking , sure... but how they asked I didn't doubt it at all that it was all included.   Just like chips and salsa or complimentary bread at places.

My husband refuses to go back there to eat. Me on the other hand would like to give it another try.  Let's just say we were treated differently than the \"white\" patrons.  We arrived before the \"white\" family and we were waiting to be seated and they seated the other family before us. Which was rude on both parts... The family could have said we were first. The host didn't even ask, just took them and we had to wait a bit longer.  Our waitress was also short with us. Took our order, brought us our food but never checked on us. We had to signal her over to us for drink refills but she did check on the other guests quite often. We didn't feel welcome. Is it because we have brown skin? I don't want to believe it but it was kind of obvious. It was the whole vibe of not feeling welcome. I ignored it. Thought it was just me but after we left my husband said the exact same thing. Which is too bad, I enjoyed their food and German Chocolate cake.",

The servers always seem like they'd rather be ANYWHERE else. No one makes eye contact, or smiles. It's very unwelcoming. The food is okay, but not great. The gravy tastes packaged. The bread pudding and cinnamon rolls are fantastic, but the green beans taste like they come out of a can. I don't eat canned vegetables at home, I'm certainly not going to pay for them at a restaurant. Also, the dishes are very overpriced. In a city with hundreds of places to eat, this place just falls short. I won't be going back.",

After going to a spot that was way too loud and way too trendy, I convinced my fam to come here after seeing their signs around the Blue Diamond/Rainbow area for years now and wanting to try it. They have homemade cinnamon rolls that are massive and downright sinful they are so good! (Our table embarrassingly inhaled 4 with one to go!) Breakfast was delicious too - True southern style comfort food. And the service was impeccable! We all agree that this will be our new breakfast spot from now on. It's so nice to find a taste of home (Atlanta) out here in the desert. Thank you guys for a wonderful experience!!!!",

    "text": "For anyone who's familiar with the area, Rainbow finally opens up to Cactus, making this place MUCH easier to access! But with all of the construction, check Google Maps for the fastest route.  Our Families Country Cafe is a little breakfast place attached to the side of a local Bar. One unique aspect of this hidden gem is that you can leave a coffee mug at the restaurant and grab it on your next visit when you sit down. It's nothing major, but it adds to that \"at home\" feeling.  The food is awesome! They use the good patty breakfast sausage that isn't too fatty and has good flavor. The steak is perfect, the bacon is crispy, the French toast is sweet and delectable, and the biscuits and gravy are addicting! Everything you get for the price is amazing! Even if you order to go, it'll be ready faster than you expect; I've never been disappointed.   The only real negative is the location. For me, it's not too difficult to commute, but unless you live in Mountain's Edge or Southern Highlands, this place is REALLY out of the way. Although, I don't necessarily mind that, because the less busy, the more I can enjoy!  Overall, if you're willing to make the trip, you won't be disappointed! Our Families Country Cafe does everything right, and will definitely become one of your new favorite breakfast destinations!",

Decided to try it out one morning when our normal breakfast place was and hour and a half wait...just craziness for a breakfast spot to have that kind of a wait time. Came here and there was no wait, it was busy but no where near the wait time that there is at other spots. We waited maybe 5 minutes for a table.   Service was good. They are a family ran restaurant I think so that's what you feel like when you're here. Like you're going into a family members kitchen for breakfast. Very much a cosy feel to this place.  Food is good too. Again pretty much the same as other breakfast spots except they don't do crazy pancake flavors which isn't a bad thing!",

The restaurant is pretty small from where we were sitting and I also found out that they have a bar as well! It's homey with lots of country decor and mugs all over the place.  Upon sitting down, a homemade fresh cinnamon roll was offered to us and you could tell it was homemade! Delicious!!!! We ordered our meals and drinks and it came pretty quickly.  My husband and I weren't too impressed with the food- we got a country nacho plate because we are obsessed with nachos and a meat burrito that had a few varieties of meat in it. The picture of the nachos looked better than it tasted. It basically had regular tortilla chips, sprinkled shredded cheese that looked microwaved, a mix of country white gravy with chicken fried steak and jalapenos, sour cream and salsa. Nothing too spectacular but I think the shredded cheese didn't so anything. For the nachos, If you're looking for something cheesy, this isn't it. The burrito was good, a good size for 2 people and it's very filling. It had chunks of ham, steak strips and chicken. Their home fries are delicious, so I recommend getting that as well!  All in all, I think we will come back and try the breakfast menu instead of the nachos.",

    "text": "We used a Groupon on the way to southern California, and were glad to be introduced to a fine restaurant with which we were previously unfamiliar. The atmosphere inside is nice and homey, with comfortable seating at tables or booths. It reminded me of a warm country cafe. Artificial but colorful flowers abound.   I began with a bowl of the soup of the day, which was Creamy Chicken Soup that, besides a creamy chicken broth and hand-cut pieces of white chicken, contained pieces of celery and carrots. Unfortunately, the strong flavor of these particular carrots dominated the taste of the dish. It was good but served warm rather than hot, and was just too carrot-intensive for my palate. Garlic bread actually consisted of dinner rolls that had been cut in half and treated with garlic butter. These altered bread products struck me as neither fish nor fowl, and just did not satisfy. I would have greatly preferred pure dinner rolls or crisp slices of garlic bread rather than the hybrid combination that was presented.   Other than these two misses, the rest of the food Diane and I enjoyed were definite hits. My Chicken Fried Steak was superb in taste except for two bites that included tough sinewy meat. The rest of the breaded cube steak was spot on. And, the Country Gravy that was generously spread over the Country Fried Steak and accompanying delicious creamy mashed potatoes was delicious. Both the gravy and the mashed potatoes would be hard to top. I was told that green beans are normally served with the Chicken Fried Steak, but it was the end of the day, and the restaurant was all out of green beans. So, broccoli was offered instead. I demurred, and nice slices of red tomato were plated instead. I also sampled a big bite of Diane's Fish & Chips, and the hot and crispy battered cod was also excellent in taste, just as were the seasoned french fries.   Most of the food here is homemade on premises. And, the chef/co-owner enjoys baking pies and cakes as well. His Peach Cobbler with a scoop of yellow-colored Vanilla Ice Cream was light, spongy, and excellent. His version of Chocolate Cake was very moist, chocolaty, and delicious with its own scoop of sun-shaded Vanilla Ice Cream. What is a restaurant review without testing desserts! Ah, the sacrifices I sometimes make in eating high caloric foodstuffs for the benefit of my readers, and to compile a comprehensive multi-course review!   Service was quick and very friendly by the daughter of the owners. As the name reveals, this is a family enterprise. In fact, we were extended a friendly greeting by one owner not long after being seated, and met and chatted with both owners before we departed. They are Yelp friendly, too. For, a Yelp sticker appears on the cafe's glass front door. The place is difficult to find situated as it is near a dead end on an edge of Mountain's Edge. But it is worth making a trek to this fine diamond in the rough for one or more fine meals!   I know that I will soon return to this lovely cafe for other edible treats!",

Everyone raved about the country fried steak so I tried it. Honestly, the food was mediocre. The guy who served us was very direct and rude. He would ask us a question and if we didn't answer quick enough, he would walk away. He did this a couple of times.   The food came out fast, we waited about 10 mins till it came to our table. I read other reviews about people waiting longer.  Okay, brace yourself for this part... My 3 year old needed to use the restroom so my husband took him. In the restroom was our server. My husband saw him walk out of the stall and not even wash his hands!!!!! As my husband walked back to our table with our son, I watched our server serve another customer their plate and a coke!!!! GROSSS!!!!!!   Just because of that incident, we are NEVER going back. They're not very welcoming or friendly there anyway.",

    "text": "Experience: Visiting a friend that lives around the corner and he suggested this place.   Facility:  This is a med size restaurant that has tables and chairs, and booths along the wall. It has a cafe/small restaurant feel. It also shares the building with a Tavern next door, but since it was Sat afternoon, we will skip the booze. LOL!   Service: When you walk in there is a sign that says wait to be seated. We stood waiting as we saw 3 different wait staff look at us, but not acknowledge us. After a few minutes, we discussed leaving and where else we wanted to go, and finally one of the wait staff came over...just in time too. He explained that they are a family place, and used to repeat customers. Their usuals know to just grab a seat in one of the booths, unless they have a big party. Um...ok.  Now besides this first bad impression, I actually loved the service and the staff. They are a family spot, with Dad in the back cooking, brother (Jason) running things, and the sister (Kyla - ?... Sorry, I forgot) and nephew serving. And, they were all friendly and helpful when they came to our table...even Jason, who doesn't really smile. That's the family joke. LOL!  So, we were told they used to be located up North and then relocated to the Southwest for a better location.   Food: the offer a cinnamon roll to start, but I'm not a fan, so I skipped this. Jason told me that have Chicken fried steak comparable to the South. So, being the Southern gal I am, who can resist anything fried and smothered in gravy, I was sold. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak dinner 4/5 with mashed potatoes, roll and fried creamed corn aka corn fritter.  It was good, he was right about that. I've had better in Louisiana, but this is probably some of the best you'll get in Las Vegas!  Overall:  I liked this spot. I like the family part of the restaurant. I liked the staff and service was good. And I really liked the food. Just sucks it's in the Southwest. Still, I'll come back someday. :)",

    "text": "We went to Country Cafe on a Monday very late morning, nearly 11 am.  As many note, it's NOT on Rainbow, despite what the address indicates.  You need to take Buffalo, then turn left on Cactus.  Then, it's up on the right where the road dead ends.  Why they have a Rainbow address when Rainbow isn't completed is beyond me.  Depending on where you live in the Valley, it's a trek to get to Country Cafe.  We live well into Hendertucky, so it was quite a drive for us.  But, it was worth it.    I had the chicken fried steak sandwich, I wanted to order the dinner plate, but the mashed potatoes weren't ready yet.  That was a little frustrating since we ordered after 11 am, but you gotta love that they are making them.  Sometimes homemade food just isn't ready when you want it.  So, I had the sandwich, which comes with lettuce, onion, pickles and gravy with a side of fries.  I didn't care for the lettuce on the sandwich.  The fries were large and very crispy.  Sort of a beer batter breading, thicker than usual.  I really liked them, and you get quite an order.  The chicken fried steak was excellent.  I'd read that it was the best in town and it lived up to the billing.  It's certainly the best chicken fry I've had in Vegas.  The sandwich basically fell apart as I was eating it, so I finished with a fork.  Can't wait to return to get the dinner.  The wife had chili and a grilled cheese.  These were both standard, but the chili lacked heat in a big way.  We tried the fried creamed corn bites, and they were fantastic.  Excellent breading, and you could taste the corn, not just breading flavor.  Excellent.  Service was very friendly and prompt.  We will definitely return despite the long distance from our house.",

    "text": "FIRST OF ALL... oh my god why the heck is this in the middle of no-where?! LOL its at the edge of mountains edge and you have to cut across mountain's edge by buffalo and down cactus to the end. If you are in the area or live in the area, its actually not that bad. I live on the west side of town but was in the area for work so decided to meet up with some friends for brunch.   Decor, outside, looks fairly simple. Inside, the decor is very country style. There are two wall racks of cups. Lots of wooden decor. Tables in the middle and booths along the side.   You find your own seats. We were greeted fairly fast and were given our drinks (waters lol) quick.   After referring to yelp the day before, i had noticed a lot of people had recommended the chicken fried steak as well as the biscuits and gravy. Upon reviewing on the menu, the Country Breakfast is the one with a chicken fried steak and smothered country gravy. Biscuits & Gravy has two golden biscuits smothered in homemade country sausage gravy, with homefries or batter fries. Not being too much of a fan of biscuits & gravy, and wanted a more full brunch, so decided to get the country breakfast instead.   Upon ordering, i was told that the Country Breakfast comes with a side of either toast, or biscuits & gravy and i think there was some other stuff... I didn't hear the rest of it after i heard the biscuits & gravy ! i was like O.O biscuits & gravy ! woo i get to try both ! woo :D   *edit* LOL so apparently the top of the menu says \"All Two Egg Breakfasts served with HomeFries (Diced Potatoes, Bell Peppers, & Onions) or Batter Fries (Fried Seasoned Potatoes) and a Choice of Toast (Wheat, White, Rye, Sourdough), English Muffin, Biscuit & Gravy, or Hot Cakes...   Country Breakfast - $9.99 - Chicken Fried Steak, smothered in country gravy, a side of seasoned cubed potatoes, as well as two eggs. And as i had said before, i decided to get the biscuits & gravy for the side. Overall, pretty big portions ! Though i had expected the country fried steak to be bigger (have seen bigger, but whatever and LOL thats what she said XD) ANYWAY... the main attraction of this item. The country fried steak. I would say it is about the size of my hand. About give or take 8-9\" across, covered in gravy XD To my surprise, the chicken is juicy and flavored wonderfully. The batter used reminds me of batter used at popeyes fried chicken batter. Light and super crispy. Overall, a great item and highly recommended. To be honest, prior to this experience, i wasn't too fond of eating a chicken fried steak (maybe bad past experiences? but i dont remember lolol). But this has completely changed my mind XD ! The gravy was a nice creamy sauce, that is not too salty but seasoned nicely. The potatoes are diced are seasoned and cooked with chopped bell peppers and onions. Fairly yummy side. Eggs were cooked to perfection. Perfect over-easy as ordered. Breaking a yolk over the country fried steak adds a nice rich flavor.   Biscuits & Gravy side - two golden biscuits smothered in homemade country sausage gravy. The  only thing that is different from the normal menu item, is it doesn't come with homefries or batter bites... The biscuits, i dont know if it was because i didn't eat it till the end, but the biscuits not as good as i had hoped for. Biscuits are one of my favorite items in terms of baked goods. The gravy used is made with some uncased sausage. Adds a nice flavor but a little salty, in my opinion, to be eaten alone. Overall, still pretty good.   Overall, great experience. They are willing to split checks as well. Would love to come back in the future, to try other items on the menu. Though a little out of the way... XD",

They can accommodate about 25 people or so based on seats. We had the breakfast sandwich and the club sandwich. Fresh, home style cooking. The food took a bit to come out but understandable for a weekend morning. Tasted great and inexpensive. Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "If it weren't for the food... a solid 3 stars due to spotty customer service.  Plus it's hard to find truly good breakfast gravy in this town, and they do have some good gravy here - not that stuff with the tiny minced sausage.  *Personal opinion - Can be interesting if you look a little different.... My friend and I are both fully sleeved (tattoos) and I never have a \"normal\" hair color (style most times, color never).  We don't have anything offensive tattoo-wise, but seem to draw alot of stares or consternation from both staff and patrons depending on the day.  They always seem to be surprised that we act like normal people.  I do expect that to some degree but it can be a little unnerving at this place. It's not ALWAYS like this, but it's happened quite a few times.  Classic America fare (country food).  Food has been consistently good.  Service is another story entirely.  It ranges from great to \"why did this person even bother coming to work today\".  Pros:  Good food and super large drinks   Good prices Large portions Good location for Mountain's Edge/Southern Highlands.  Not hard to find since they have signage everywhere directing you to the spot. Connected to a Bounty Hunter should you want to partake in the spirits Large lot for parking Have a copy of the current newspaper available at front to peruse at your table for free  Cons - Inconsistent service Have had takeout a few times and have never had one order that didn't have something missing  Worth a try for the food, especially if you are in the Mountain's Edge area.",

In addition, it is made even more intimate by the close proximity and small curtain which separates the kitchen and the dining area. It really feels as if you're invited over to dine in the home of the owning family.  The service is incredibly friendly and attentive, and the food has never failed me once in the many times I've ordered to-go or came in around brunch hours. Their country gravy is the best I've had in town, the corned beef hash crispy, the potatoes always perfect and the portions huge. There are healthy substitutes if you're not feeling like such a heavy meal, and they have creative/unique options like the \"Country Nachos\": sporting a country gravy instead of cheese  With the great prices on top of all of the above mentioned, I have yet to find a single thing I don't love about this place.",

Here's the problem, 3-4 servers walking around talking and serving as they are supposed to do but never once greeted us or told us that someone would be right with us. It wasn't terribly busy either. It was 11:30am on a Saturday. We stood there for 5 mins without ever being acknowledged. As much as I wanted to like this place I can't give it a positive review based on my experience today.

On Rainbow just south of Cactus.   I waited to write a review because I wanted to try the chicken fried steak for myself. I love crispy, and this batter was one of the best! I chose over easy egg, potatoes and pancakes instead of the hash browns and biscuit. I like that the gravy was not too rich or heavy. The first time I came here, I had the breakfast sandwich with hash browns and it was ok but didn't rock my world - same for the coffee. From my picture, it looks like the hash browns are burnt, but they didn't taste burnt.  But what stands out to me are the people who work there. The first time, we chatted with the owner a bit who was quite personable. This second time, one of our servers was so chatty and made us laugh with his storytelling skills!   If you're in the area, give this place a try. I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu.",

Hubby and I have been coming here for a long time since before you could only access this restaurant from the west side of Mountains Edge parkway!  Their breakfast is outstanding.  My breakfast-food hating son loves their chicken fried steak!  I love their friendly service, their delicious always perfectly cooked bacon, and today had the mini corn fritters with syrup as a starter... deeelish!   This place loves kids with a variety of options and a play area while your waiting for your table and not four used crayons to go with awesome kids menu but a full box!  Great food and country hospitality.. you won't be disappointed!",

The service was excellent and the owner stopped by our table of couple of times making sure we didn't need anything. Making his presence known (nIce gesture).  The order came out fairly quickly.

My wife had the burger steak and I the chicken fried chicken.  I thought both were great. the mashed potato and green beans were also great.  Portion size on the sides were  a bit small.  Our biggest issue was the attentiveness of our servers...multiple people took care of us and walked by several times without checking on us...we needed refills, napkins, boxes...but had to wait...i actually ended up getting the napkins and boxes myself.  Lisa was the name on our check...i believe she was our main server...she was very nice.  I would have probably given 5 stars if the service was more prompt...i will come back....hoping they take the constructive criticism...i want to make this one of my regulars....",

We went inside and waited to be seated, which I didn't mind because it is a small place and I understand that they have a limited number of tables. However, after we were seated we waited 20 minutes and no one had taken our order. Two tables were sat after us and both received their drinks and had their orders taken as we sat there and watched. There is no order with the way things are ran and that leads to tables not being waited on. I also noticed that as food was coming out the runner had to search for what table to go to and the same thing happened with handing out checks. Unfortunately, I will not be back.",

I had the chicken breast and it was very juicy and good.  They were out of mashed potatoes and baked potatoes which I wanted to try.  The soup of the day hearty beef soup which was tasty.  Green beans were from a can and not fresh.  Wife had the chicken fried steak and I sampled two. It's and could tell it was frozen and fried to order.  Grown up in Texas for 35 years we know how it should be.  Fresh cubed tenderized steak that should be dredged in flour with buttermilk sometimes twice before frying.  Do not expect this to be that way FYI.  It was served with a roll instead of the traditional homemade buttermilk biscuit as in the south.  I would suggest visiting the south, hit some of the restaurants out there to get a feel of what they do.  Not knocking this place as it has potential but rather a suggestion.",

My 16 yrs old son ordered fries (which he meant FRENCH FRIES), but when the order came it was home fries--- which my son doesn't know anything about.  The mad waiter said, \"you said home fries, so you get this!!!\"  Without any offer of \"would like me to get you French fries instead\" like any other restaurants would do.

Once we walked in here the other day, I was immediately reminded.   The waitress just stared at us when we walked in. I said, \"Do we just seat ourselves?\" She responded, \"Well that's what the sign says.\" Obviously I didn't read the sign if I asked the question, but she didn't need to be sarcastic about it. Maybe they should have a recorded message that says, \"Please seat yourself\" when you walk in the door, since they get irritated when people ask. It took us about 15 SECONDS to find a table and sit because I couldn't decide if I wanted something by the window, a 2 seat table, or a 4 seat table. I didn't think that was long at all, but when the waitress came up to us with our menus, she said, \"Wow, I didn't realize finding a table was so hard.\" Then she took our drink orders (coffee and water). The coffee was $1.55 with unlimited refills. When she came back, we both ordered veggie omelets ($7.75 ea.)  The veggies omelets were average. I just found it weird that they put whole slices of tomatoes in the center (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FeDX3TWDnGMXq4hXmwgBkJg%2Fl.jpg&s=f61313ea6341e5ed667ac7f388a584c86a3e65fdcbca9e3f4e5ee3b4a3ac4213\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>).  The coffee was very good though and I got about 3 refills.   Overall, I don't think I'd come back here even though I live a couple miles away. I just don't like the service and the food is just mediocre. If the waitress was completely quiet the whole time, it would've been better.   Tip: Directions: Go south on Buffalo, make a left on Cactus and when you get to the end, it'll be on your right.",

    "text": "As a displaced texan I have been craving chicken fried steak.  Finally I've found the best chicken fried steak in las vegas.  Now I haven't tried all of the chicken fried steak in town but those I have well....... id rather eat my shoe.  This chicken fried steak and cream gravy doesn't match up to my favorite places back home but when I have a craving for CFS I can go here and it hits the spot.  I ordered the breakfast meal with the wggs over medium and breakfast potatoes and wheat toast.    Portion size: perfect.  The CFS wasn't hanging over the plate like back home but I could eat everything and not feel too bad about myself. (Should have asked for more gravy)  Eggs were slightly overcooked. But id rather have harder yolks than runny whites.  Potatoes yummy. Nicely seasoned.   Toast was well toasty.   To drink I had the sweet tea.  Now that also was to my tast.  It not as sweet as say a Georgia Southern sweet tea but more like a Texas sweet tea.  If you don't know what im talking about just go to breakfast and try it.  Now about the service.  (A lot of the reviews here talk about the rude guy)  there were two guys a littler guy (quiet and friendly) and our server. He was a bigger guy (hed be a hoss in Texas)  I wouldn't call him rude.  Gruff maybe blunt yeah but Frienldy and didn't treat us poorly.   But I just went to try the CFS so didn't really care about him.",

Now, for those commenting on the appearance of the wonderful family that works here, you have no right to judge. To focus on the negative is a reflection of your life. If you feel like a hooker after eating here, that sounds like you need to raise your standards.   Now, the secret family recipes always have me coming back for more. When you are a regular, yes you may be treated a little better. New customers will of course be treated with great service, but when you really get to know this family you really make there day by coming back to see them.   If you have a tendency of being grouchy, don't come. Don't disturb the patrons who truly enjoy this place.",

She actually took a road trip while waiting on us and then told us about it ha ha. Every time she has waited on us she has been rude and extremely slow. The owner is actually a nice guy....

We came here early Sunday afternoon for a late breakfast. We were greeted and sat right away. The staff was very friendly.  I ordered the veggie omelette with homefries and hot cakes. My omelette was overdone, eggs had no flavor, not fluffy, the mushrooms were canned. The potatoes were ok. The hot cakes were rubbery and tasted like flour paste. I tried my husbands biscuits and gravy, which was horrible. The gravy tasted like it was from a can, it was cold and too thick, the biscuit was hard.  The only items that were decent were the orange juice, coffee, potatoes and bacon.  Sad to say I will not eat here again.",

I let him know the first name he wrote down came in last and the party sitting on our right was here first.  He nodded, no greeting or anything.  When he came to seat people down he sat down the party that came last.  This place has no respect and does not care who has been waiting.

Also, I ordered a fried egg and the cook brought out a scrambled egg.  I told him I ordered a fried egg and he replied, \"what's the difference\" and grabbed my plate and huffed away.

That struck me as odd as the order should have been checked before we got it.  We asked for our bacon to be slightly more crispy and not fatty. They brought is back burnt bacon.   They offered no concession or apology for the improperly cooked food.   The bidder kept coming by trying to take our plates when there was still food on them and we were still eating.   There are too many good breakfast places to go back here. We will just drive up rainbow to the competition.  I suggest you do the same.",

We waited 10 minutes for someone to even see us even though half of the establishment was empty, and we were the only ones waiting to be seated. Eventually the dish washer told us their manager would seat us shortly. We sat down in the waiting area and waited some more. Finally we were seated in a booth. Another 5 minutes passes, nobody has taken our drink order or given us a second glance. I overhear the family seated behind us complaining that they'd been stuck there for close to two hours and haven't gotten their check. The family seated behind my husband were then complaining that they'd been waiting for 45 minutes and had only just gotten their orders taken. By this point we are getting some seriously bad vibes. A girl that came in after we did ordered food to go and she got her food delivered and paid for within 10 minutes while the rest of us were waiting. We were also watching the people that work there, they seemed very disjointed and like they didn't know what they were doing. After about 10 minutes of sitting in the booth with no service we closed our menus and left. Maybe the food is good but I guess we'll never know.",

I ordered anyways, having read the good reviews on here I thought maybe she was just having a rough morning and decided to try the food. When we picked the food up  the staff seemed cold and stressed out. We ordered the 2 step and hungry farmer. Maybe because it was a to go order it was different somehow but the food was just okay. Nothing really special about it persay but not bad either. The staff could have been much friendlier which would definitely have encouraged me to go back and try the food in person but having such a negative experience in that aspect we won't be returning.",

Make sure you get your gravy on the side so that you can dip the sandwich. Also, great place for BREAKFAST! Pancakes are yummy as are the breakfast potatoes.   This place is comfortable and very casual.  Some people may be put off by the service but that's because you haven't been there enough to know their style. They are really good people....just a little sarcastic and joking. It's only because they like you.",

If your looking for good service then I suggest elsewhere but if you like to be left alone then this is the place to go to.",

Take Rainbow, take a right on Blue Diamond, then take a left on Buffalo, and finally turn left on Cactus. The restaurant will be located on the right at the end of the street.  My boyfriend read good reviews about the country fried steak and wanted to try it. After reading the menu, I ended up getting the country fried chicken because I was craving fried chicken. My boyfriend ordered the special, which was half a rack of ribs.   Our orders came with clam chowder, and I must say it was pretty tasty. It was a bit on the salty side, but that might have been because of the delicious pieces of bacon in it.   The country fried chicken was fried to perfection! Battered just right, nice and juicy inside, and covered in gravy. Honestly the best I have ever had. The ribs were fall off the bone soft, with just the right amount of sauce. My boyfriend ordered battered cream corn for one of his sides, and it was interesting. Tasty but a tad bit dry.   Definitely recommend trying this place, especially if you live around Mountain's Edge. My boyfriend normally doesn't care much for this type of food, but he was impressed with it and so was I. Will be back for sure when we're in the mood for yummy food! it is further than we would like, but well worth it.",

Maybe after the streets over there are more developed it will be easier to get to.   Anyways I really liked the food! Came for breakfast around 9 and I wasn't busy. You seat yourself unless your party is over 5 people. The one server that was working at the time was doing pretty good by himself but I wonder what would have happened if it got busy... I got the breakfast burrito with the battered potatoes. Loved it! The salsa that they served with it was really good. I really like the potatoes too. Bf got the chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy. Yummmmmy! He ate it all in like 5 minutes. I would defiantly come back to try the dinner menu.",

We each ordered easy over eggs which came with bacon and home fries. My wife, in a senior moment, substituted 2 hot cakes for the toast.

The restaurant is always clean and the staff makes you feel at home. Speaking of the staff, the restaurant is family owned and operated and loves dishing out just enough attitude to make you laugh. If there is one item on the menu that is an absolute must, I'd say that's \"the country nachos\", the best tasting twist on nachos ever. Country Cafe has a feel of something that's been lost since I was young and it keeps me coming back.",

I really love fried chicken.   FOOD  The fried chicken came with mashed potatoes and green beans. I'm usually not a fan of green beans and I finished my vegetables. They have a special seasoning that made me keep on eating. Fried chicken has hints of fried chicken and it definitely hit the spot. I also enjoyed their lemonade. Perfect balance. My friend had their rib eye and she said it was yummy a couple of times during the meal. Her son had the pizza which came with homemade chips that had special seasoning on it too. We all help eat the chips, so good. Everyone at the table also mentioned that the clam chowder was yummy too.   SERVICE  The owner/family member took pride in all of their food. Rightfully so. I did enjoy her service, thought it does take a while for her to warm up to you. Our Family's Country Cafe is definitely comfort food at its best. I really felt like there was a grandma back there or eating in someone's home. I look forward to my next visit.   My friends also mentioned that they enjoy their breakfast menu too.   I really hole they do well. Support, support, support.",

    "text": "Their address might be on Rainbow, but it's not as simple as driving down that road to get there. Rainbow dead ends at Mountain's Edge Parkway so you have to get on Buffalo and take a left on Cactus to get there. They're located within the Mountain's Edge community at the corner of Cactus and where Rainbow will eventually continue (right now it's just a dirt road).  The restaurant is relatively small but the interior has a cozy, old-school country feel to it. Something along the lines of Cracker Barrel (for those familiar w/ that east coast restaurant chain), but on a much smaller scale. If the name of the place sounds familiar it's because the owner used to own a place in north vegas with the same name. He sold it 2 years ago and opened this place earlier this year.  As for the food, I came here for lunch and had the country fried steak sandwich. It was a huge serving -- lightly fried and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It was served on a toasted bun, smothered in gravy and topped with onions and lettuce. I haven't had a country fried steak in years, but this was as good as any I remember. The fries it came with were big cuts, again perfectly fried making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Cost: $5.99 with tax  There was no wait staff, just the owner and his wife (I think) working the place. He stopped by a couple times to chat and check to see if I needed anything else. He seemed like a really nice guy. Hopefully they'll get enough business from the surrounding neighborhood to stay in business a while.   Their prices are very reasonable. $6-8 for sandwiches, $8-12 for entrees. They're open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",

Made a third and final trip back hoping for a better experience...but was def not the case. The service was beyond slow. The owner's EXTREMELY RUDE SON got both our orders wrong...then promptly blamed us! He even joked with the customers at the next table, saying they didn't know how to order, same as us.

On my third visit, I ordered the French toast and was presented with one slice of thin, burnt appearing FT. I got the attention of one of the wait help and showed him the problem before even taking one bite. His words were, \"Oh it's overcooked\" and he took it back for replacement. Another waiter came back and said, for your information that's how our customers like the French toast. Then my waitress came by and said, \"the reason it is so dark is because of the cinnamon they put on top gets dark.\" First of all, we are talking about a piece of bread, not filet mignon that was half eaten and someone tries to return.   I am not fresh off the boat and at 58 years old have eaten and cooked enough French toast, to know how it should appear. We never argued and it fact for some stupid reason, still tipped. I have worked as a waitress in the past and the first response anyone in customer service related job should be , \"What can we do to make you happy?\". I will never eat there again. If you want a really great breakfast, with professional, pleasant wait help, go to T bird's. I go to the one on Blue Diamond.",

It's my favorite meal of the day and I'm not too picky when it comes to the food. Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes ... can't really mess that up. When we first walked in, we weren't greeted immediately. The staff overall seems a little unorganized and not urgent enough. There was a lot of wait time. More so, our waitors lacked the warm, friendly, \"I'm here to help you\" attitude you expect from a good restaurant. The food is decent though and one of only a few breakfast spots in the area so can't say I wouldn't return. Again, I love breakfast. Hopefully future visits will be better.",

On the bright side, eggs were good, biscuit and gravy good, fruit cup good.  The waitress  brought my change and did not thank me for patronizing her place.  Better CFS can be had at the Las Vegas Motor Resort Diner on Arville, just north of Blue Diamond.   I also thought the price at Our Families was overpriced by at least $2.

Extremely disappointed when it arrived when I seen a normal size chicken breast and a wing, thigh and drum that looked like it came from a pigeon.  The server even laughed when she delivered the plate. I will post a picture of them next to a child's crayon to show the size. When I asked for a manager, she told me that is what I would get anywhere and defended the size of the pieces and the $15 cost.  I was insulted and sent the entire meal back.  This was a Friday, around 6 night and we were the only table.  Its no wonder.  I will not be back and would not recommend to anyone.",

We have enjoyed the friendliness of Belinda and Lisa in the past. Our drinks always filled and were attentive to our table no matter weather they had a packed place or no one at all. The last visit we came, we knew none of the staff, there was no warm and friendly inviting feeling and the experience was quite different. We hadn't been back since and decided to give it another go around this evening. Big mistake. We came in there were a decent amount of people which cleared out pretty quickly. Our sons order was taken and his food came right out, our orders got taken pretty quick after which was nothing special, we ordered wings and fries and I ordered a BLT, we waited over 45 mins for our food. In that time while waiting we noticed a lot of UBER eats orders leaving, still we waited. It was not a good experience and the last 2 visits, the food is good but customer service has really went down hill and we probably won't come back which is a shame because this has been our go to place for a long time and we often refer people.

The burgers are made with lots of spices and you can taste the meat. Idk how to explain it but it's the rarest occurrence that I had only experienced once before.   I'm not a big drink type f person but I love their sweet tea. It reminds me of mcdonalds sweet tea ad my husband loved their lemonade. I hate lemonade and it tasted surprisingly similar to raisin canes lemonade.  Best part?! They are linked to a bar. Yep, have dinner and head to the bar. The waitress even said we could leave our car and we are close enough to walk home. The restaurant is warm an cozy, grandma style and the bar side is the crazy whiskey side.   They also have a punch card which on the second visit gets you 10% off, the 4th visit is a free dessert ad the 6th is a 2 for 1 entree.",

I also like having the option of biscuits and gravy as a side, can't find that in many other places. I got the typical eggs and bacon platter and everything was spot on. Bacon is especially good, crispy, and the portion are generous. Never seems to be a long wait either which can be an issue with other breakfast joints. I definitely recommend!",

I understand Mother's Day is a very busy and stressful day in the restaurant industry as I have worked in it before, but I felt very unwelcome. Like I'm pretty sure the staff at Applebee's don't wear business casual attire either but I think they would show a customer where their table is if they couldn't see it. Then when we got the bill they charged us for only a grilled cheese which we didn't order. So we returned the bill because it was wrong and the man thanked us for our honesty. And it's like yeah just be a good person jeez it's not that hard. But it totally sucked to be talked to that way when I want to treat my mom nicely on Mother's Day. It didn't bother her but it really bothered me. And if it's suppose to be a part of the \"country theme\" to be like that I'm pretty sure it's quite the opposite my mother is from Virginia one of the most \"country\" like areas so it really wasn't fooling anybody it's just bad manners. French toast was good as always. Coffee was too weak per usual at most breakfast places. I drank it like water.",

Famous for the country fried steak so both of us ordered that and were very impressed with the taste and portion size. Good ol country gravy over real mashed potatoes. Mm mm good.  Then we were in the mood for the home made desserts and those were awesome too. Had the peach cobbler first and then we decided to try the strawberry shortcake too. YUM O  Very nice waitress named Lee. She has been back with them just a few weeks but worked for them at their previous locations so you might know her from those. Sorry to hear some folks didn't have that same great service but Lee will give it to you so give em another chance.  DEFINITELY will come back.",

Really love the environment. Very homey. The people that worked there were really nice as well.   The food was DELISH! I ordered something so plain (Grilled Chicken with Steamed Veggie) and OMG, it was soOO good! My bf ordered the Mushroom Swish Burger with Onion Rings and wow, he loved it. Didn't have to any condiments at all. He also ordered the Brownie Sundae for himself and it was pretty huge!   They also offer stamping. After your first visit you get a stamp, the next visit you get 10% off. On your 5th visit, you get a free dessert and on the 8th visit you get 2 for 1 Entree.   During breakfast, from 9-11am and 9-3pm on Sundays, if you bring your own mug, you get free coffee! How great is that? Should definitely go and check it out.",

A tiny cottage setting, the food was good, service was quick and the price was right.   Attached to a bar, the day we visited there were about 150 bikers in the parking lot, no joke. They were having a fundraiser and there was live music which we could hear through the wall. No big thang, didn't change the way the food tasted. I think the owner was afraid we would u turn it out of the parking lot, he practically waved us in from the street. We were alerted that \"it's not usually like this\". haha I had the Salad Wrap which was fresh and tasty. The drinks come in basically vats.  The menu had a good variety for both lunch and breakfast. Sandwiches, burgers, omelettes, the usual. Homemade mac or potato salad..but hope you like celery. It's plentiful.   The desserts sounded awesome but we declined. Brownie sundae, peach cobbler...and you know it was gonna be warm with ice cream and...damn we should have gotten it.   All the more reason to delve deep into Mountains Edge once again!",

No one greeted us , no one came with menus. We ended up grabbing menus from a near by table. Long story short the customer service is just awful. I hope this place gets replaced with a robertoes.",

In addition, the women waiting us offered a 2 for 1 bloody mary, and we took the deal, but it turned out we -both- had to get 2 drinks and pay for 2 drinks. Seemed odd, and we didnt even touch the second drinks. Why couldn't she just let us pay for 1?  The brother was late, causing quite a backup. I do understand its a smaller place, but come on!",

It's not so much as they aren't friendly because they are, it's the fact they have kids working here that don't know customer service. They don't refill your drinks and you don't see anyone because they are all in the kitchen. It's very kid friendly with toys and books for them to play. I'm giving them four stars because the food was AMAZING!! The service needs some work, especially once the street Cactus opens up, it will be busy! It took us 45 mins to get our food.

But, for those of you that want to try it.. I know the address says it's on Rainbow - but Rainbow does not go through all the way yet. So, if you're on Blue Diamond, Get onto Buffalo, turn left at Cactus and go all the way down, and you'll see it on your left.   I'm not really sure what I was expecting when I walked into the place, but I liked what I saw. The place was decorated with a crap load of Christmas stuff. A little own of miniatures houses and a huge Christmas tree ! I'm not sure how festive the restaurant is on a normal basis, but it looks cute now.   I really wanted to try this place for two reasons: 1. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF BREAKFAST FOODS ! 2. I'm on a mission to find the best Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas.   The CFS here was good. Almost comparable to my favorite in Vegas so far [Babycakes]. It was good, very good...[not chewy at all!!] but a little too peppery for my taste [not overpowering or anything]. Now, if you're a person who likes pepper, then you'll probably enjoy this. It's safe to say that this is the 2nd best [at least in my opinion] CFS in Vegas. The portion of the CFS is also quite smaller compared to Babycakes, but still big enough to fill you. The gravy was a very nice. Probably the best gravy I've gotten on any CFS. It was rich, thick, and had bits of sausage throughout it. Very, very good !   I ordered the scrambled eggs with my CFS, as well as the battered potatoes. The scrambled eggs were underwhelming. Well seasoned, but definitely overcooked. Potatoes were good. I'm not a big potato fan at all, but I actually ate quite of few of their potatoes. They were nice and crispy.  I'm excited to go back and try the rest of the offerings.  The service could have been better, but it wasn't quite bad enough to knock this review down to four stars.",

As soon as we walk in we are greeted by a man that seemed like he was in a horrible mood. He had a horrible attitude, but I let it go because I thought that It might just be a bad day for him... we sat down at a booth. The waiter kept passing by us as didn't even acknowledge us. After about the 4th time he pasee us, he asked us what we wanted to drink, we gave him our drink order. And since I have gone a couple other times, we know that they have coloring pages and crayons for kids, so when he took our drinks i asked if I can get a coloring page and some crayons, he walks away and about 3 minutes later he brings us the crayons and tells us that they don't have any coloring pages and walks away. We where ready to order but he just left. So we waited for him to come again, and he just kept passing us over and over, like we where to even there. I was getting a little annoyed with their service, when I saw him pass I told him they we were ready, so he took our order. And that was the LAST time he went to our table! When we needed a refill on our coffees some young guy served us more, and when we got our food two younger guys brought it to us. And I asked them for a soda and they very nicely said they would bring it right over. And that was that. I'm only giving this 2 stars because of the two young guys. They where the only ones that treated us nice. I loved this place, but seriously after that last time I don't think I will ever go again, sad to say because I really love their food, but the people they have now are rude and have horrible customer service.",

Hubster' shad 2 pancakes. We are stuffed and it all tasted good. The eggs were a bit over cooked, but I think that's all just preference  with 2 coffees our bill came out to 18.90 after tax. Not bad. Certainly cheaper than the blueberry hill we used to frequent! I will definitely be back to try out their nightly dinner specials!",

But it was far from that.  This cafe was connected to a bar and all the smoke seemed to have leaked in. Maybe this would be a good place for bikers or guys who smoke but I would never suggest this place for a family.",

    "text": "Really good food. Hubby got the Country Breakfast with the chicken fried steak, and it was wonderful. Flavorful and not too heavy. (He NEVER gets chicken fried steak and ended up eating the entire thing). I loved the home fries with my bacon and eggs. The fries had sauteed peppers and onions amongst the red skin potatoes.   We had a groupon, and sadly forgot to mention this when we ordered. Our server was gracious enough to allow it though. We really enjoyed the cozy, country atmosphere here. It felt as though we were being welcomed into a southern country kitchen. Will definitely go back.   Also, as I mentioned in a tip, it's not difficult to find. Rainbow is still under construction right here so in order to get here take Buffalo south to Cactus. At Cactus take a left and follow until you get to Rainbow. Currently, you cannot go any further as the road is closed. The restaurant is on the right, and there are signs. Enjoy :)",

I got the Honey Stung Fried Chicken, it wasn't the best fried chicken but it was tasty and not at all greasy. I wasn't a big fan of their mashed potatoes (could they be instant-maybe?). The roll was tasty. I also got a cup of their Cream of Chicken Soup...wow! this stuff is good. I'd go back just for the soup! My husband got the Rib Eye Sandwich with Fries. The sandwich was good, no grisle like you get in some steaks. The fries were also good, I stole my share from his plate!

Boyfriend was craving for chicken fried steak for a month and he researched this place. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint. This cafe is definitely out in the boonies but it wasn't difficult to get to. I mapquest it on my iphone with no problem.  We came on a Monday night. About five other tables were occupied. I know some of you had mentioned about spotty/bad service but our experience was anything BUT that. Our waitress and busboy were attentive and friendly.   Originally, I opted for the cowboy burger but that chicken fried steak just looked too good. It comes with your choice of soup or salad. My soup for the night was potato soup. And waitress claimed their ranch dressing is homemade. I'm not sure about my potato soup though. It was good and it wasn't salty at all...which I like.   The chicken fried steak was wow!!!! It came out pippin hot. Crisp to perfection on the outside but moist and tender on the inside. It was topped with some creamy country gravy. You get a choice of side. My boyfriend got the mashed potatoes and I got rice pilaf. I enjoyed my rice pilaf and my boyfriend like his mashed potatoes...it's smooth and not clumpy. He's such a potato connoisseur!! =)",

Daily dinner specials are offered beginning at 5pm. We came for brunch as my son and daughter in law treated me and my wife in celebration of Fathers day. Our table ordered the following; Chicken fried steak breakfast w/side of pancake Chicken fried chicken breakfast w/side of biscuit Chicken and Waffles Oatmeal w/all the trimmings.  Let's start with the chicken fried breakfast first. While I didn't get to taste the chicken fried steak, I was told that it's above average. I did try the chicken fried chicken. Very crispy, moist and the gravy (peppery) was the key to this dish. I didn't care for the biscuit as it wasn't the light and fluffy type that I prefer.  A little too gummy and dense for my liking. The side of pancake looked better, although, I didn't get the opportunity to taste it. Oatmeal that my wife ordered was really good. Very flavorful when I tasted it plain, but when she added all the goodies, then it became a porridge of sweetness. My special of the day, Chicken and waffles ... Waffle was crisp but dense and chewy. Different then what I prefer but really good. Chicken was heavy on the batter, very crispy and of the fingers variety. This place gets very busy so set your expectations accordingly. Also, when the dining area starts to fill up, it got pretty stuffy/warm in a hurry. Yes, I'll be back. Looking forward to having dinner next time.",

As the restaurant was busy we sat in a booth that had been recently vacated. There was still cups from the previous customers, so I just placed them on the edge of the table. We waited about 15 minutes before we were acknowledged. When the server arrived they asked if we needed refile. We replied \" these were actually here when we arrived\" so she cleared them and asked if we wanted coffee. We said \" yes please\" she brought coffee and we asked her for menus. When we received our menus we waited another 10 minutes before our server arrived. A dude with a pony tail. He was not the nicest person. My friend asked for the pancake sandwich and vaguely pointed to the menu. He proceeded to correct her and say that wasn't the pancake sandwich. He was very rude. We received our food and it was basic. The bacon 2as super dry and the pancakes were rubbery. The ponytail server seemed like he was in a rush to get us out and asked if we wanted the check 5 minutes after we received our food. We said \" sure, but can we get more coffee please?\" He brought us more coffee and the check. I would not return and I'm sure my friends won't either. I'm sorry to leave a bad review, but the service was awful.",

Loved the attention especially when it came to my water!! (I hate when I have to ask for water lol)  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice hometown feeling!",

So basically paid $22 for a potato and a roll! very disappointed!",

I had the chicken fried steak and was awesome like all the reviews said. Being from the south haven't had a good one in my 20 years living in Las Vegas. Most of them are frozen ones they try to pull off as their own recipe but this one truly is their own recipe. Server was great just wish they had more booths or different arrangement in the restaurant to accommodate a more comfortable restaurant.",

Serves food to adjacent bar (The Bounty) and its it's very tasty.    I've been to the bar several times and tried different things and haven't had a bad experience.   Today instead of going to the bar and sitting there to eat we decided to go into the restaurant.  Wow!   We have been missing out on a great experience.  Everything was perfect and we loved our food.   Whether your in the mood for a nice country style breakfast, lunch or dinner you need to try this.

The owner(s), waiters, waitresses, and cooks are very understanding of the types of allergies that you might have and they are knowledgeable of their items.    There are foods that we have tried and order the same foods every time we go there to eat.  Some of their are \"Biscuits & Gravy\", \"Ribeye Steak\", \"Cowboy Burger\", \"Pancakes\", \"French Fries\", \"Salads\", \"Soups\", and \"Fish & Chips\", to only name a few dishes are great and very tasteful.  Their \"Iced Sweet Tea\" is I think the best that I have ever tasted.    When we go there, we usually go there with another family of four (Husband & Wife, and their 2 daughters), and with me and my husband.  We all love going there to eat.   They are also located at the corner of \"Cactus\" & \"Rainbow\".   I can't wait to go there again.",

We went to another restaurant around the corner and while the food is decent, we refused to wait 30-35 minutes because the owner didn't lease a sufficient sized space. Nope! So, in the car going to another destination, my honey suggested \"the little country restaurant we saw around the corner\". We decided to give it a try.   OMG! This place is amazing! We sat down immediately and were greeted as we walked in the door. The service is excellent! The owner even came and chatted with us and offered a fresh cinnamon roll fresh out of the oven while w. The restaurant is adorable! The food is delicious and plentiful. I'm full as a tick with a big left over box. Added bonus: the restaurant sells t-shirts of which the profits go to Wounded Warriors. As the fiancee of a combat veteran, this warmed my heart. We will definitely come here again.   *** we've been back 3 times since I posted this. Gotta say...they're consistent.

Ok, the place may be located in the middle of nowhere, but if the food is good who cares, unfortunately, the food was HORRIBLE.  We go in, the place is nice.  It is small, with a country home type of vibe.  There were a few tables with people sitting and one waitress.  (This was a Wed. early afternoon.)  The waitress came by and was the most unpleasant person you could ask for.  No \"How are you's?, Do you have any questions? First time here?\"  Nothing.  She just asked, \"Are you ready to order, then just looked at my wife.\"  She had the fried chicken, and I had the chicken fried steak.  Salad came first, it was filled with wilted, brown lettuce.  You couldn't, or didn't want to eat half of it.  (Now, I am NOT one of these weird picky people, I'm a hungry man, I'll eat most crap).  The food came out next.  My wife's chicken was fried to a burnt dry crisp.  The size of the chicken portion was so small it was a joke.  You have never seen a smaller wing.  I joked that it must have come from a chick.  You know the reject wings you may get at Buffalo Wild Wings when you order like twenty of them, yeah, these wings were smaller than those reject ones.  Garbage.    I had the chicken fried steak.  It was a tv dinner.  It was a breaded salisbury steak you get in a hungry man dinner.  They slop the mashed potatoes on top of it.  The potatoes were ok as were the rolls.      Waitress asked for our coupon when we ordered, I wonder if they give you crap food because of the two for one?  Wilted lettuce and mini chicken.  Maybe we got the wrong food, I don't know.  I ordered the chicken fried steak because it said on the coupon \"Best in Vegas\".  I thought the place was nice, maybe breakfast.     Now, this is my third review....all negative.  That's most likely what it's going to be.  I'll review positive places if I think they need the help (like a new place), usually they don't as people know they are good..  I just want to warn people to be careful of some of the bad experiences I've had.  I guess I'm still looking for that place that would be seen on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives here in Vegas.",

Anyways, the best time to go is early. We had great service from our server, the drink server, and the manager/owner. We found out that they've been around for about 6 years now. I tried their specialty chicken fried steak and I was not disappointed. It was fresh, crispy and light and the gravy was just right (not to salty or bland). There was so much food that I could only eat the steak and two over medium eggs. I had to take the pancakes and potatoes home for another meal. Next time I will have to try their cinnamon roll which they make fresh each day. If you are in the area, got to stop in and try this place. I'm definitely letting all my friends at church know about this little secret, tucked away at Mountains Edge/Southern Highlands.",

My daughter had the pizza, and it was definitely a frozen brand name pizza, probably Red Baron.   My wife had the clam chowder.  She said it tasted like what one would get from the can in a grocery store.   I had the chicken fried steak.  It was pretty good, pillsbury biscuit and all.    The atmosphere was nice.  Quiet.   The staff, while not super friendly, did a sufficient enough job taking our order and bringing our food in a timely manner.     Prices were not outrageous.

    "text": "Not Horrible Not Great, my 1st time being here I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs w hot cakes and a sweet tea. Sweet tea was OK nothing special. The corned beef hash taste like it was out a can, yet made it a little crispy just how I like it. I like canned hash but I don't want that from a restaurant, I can do that at home myself. The eggs weren't real, egg beaters I guess. I love eggs and would never eat that mess. Disgusting.... home friend edible w peppers and onions but no real seasoning. Hot cakes not good, just taste like flour. Service about 5 different ppl came to my table doing a didn't job. 1 for drinks, 1 for to tell me who would take my order. 1 who took the order and forgot that i asked for cheese in my eggs. 2 to check on me. All were nice except the 1 taking the order. Bought the check quickly and took forever to cash me out. Only 2 customers, me and 2ppl at another table together.  Took so long I took a phone call finished then decided to write this review while I waited.....LOL. probly will never come back but i tried. ...",

We went to get those but they were out of biscuits :-( Although they offered to do gravy and toast - I am from the south and there is no substitute for the biscuits (sorry). The environment is homey and they have purposely placed themselves sorta outta the way in order to keep the traffic down, the food excellent and the service friendly. We will definitely be going back as its in the neighborhood and a nice change from bar breakfast food :-)",

I was very pleased I was able to order it this time, and even more excited when it arrived to the table. My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly so I could dip those highly addictive batter bites (kinda like tater tots) in my runny yolk. The hash (note: the corned beef hash is not fresh, it's  the canned kine which I have no problem with as long as it's cooked properly) was SUPER ONO! Nice & crispy, just the way I like it. This is now my go to breakfast spot! Hooray for second chances!!!",

    "text": "Great little spot for classic American fare.   We arrived around 11am for breakfast and the place had a good amount of people seated. We were lucky enough to arrive just as a booth became available. We were greeted quickly and drinks were brought out. The cups were so large, I didn't even need a refill. That's saying a lot since I'm the queen of refills. I was really impressed with the service. Everyone was very attentive. Refills were swift and food was extremely large portions.   I decided on the Wisconsin cheese omelet, my fella got the sausage and cheese omelet and my mom got a breakfast combination. We all decided on hot cakes as our sides. The food was quick and everything was great. The consensus was that the hot cakes were our favorites. They were fluffy and fabulous. Some of the best pancakes we've had in town. Everyone had a great meal. It's a bit of a drive from me, but worth it for some fantastic pancakes.   This is a family run business and almost everyone working here is related, so I'm all for supporting locally and family-run restaurants. Definitely give this place a chance. They also have a mobile car wash in their parking lot and you can put it on your food bill for convenience, if you're interested.   Just to note, unless you live in the area, it may be a little difficult to locate this restaurant. My GPS directed me all the way down Rainbow to the restaurant but the street comes to a dead end so make sure you follow the signs to the restaurant or call and they will direct you properly.",

I had to try their special country nachos, which is essentially chicken fried steak and gravy on nachos and cheese, sprinkled with bacon. Lots of calories, but it was oh so good. Kids and husband loved their meals too (kids meals at $4.99 ea). We asked for to go cups to take our leftover drinks with us for the long drive home, and waitress gave us giant cups filled with our drinks!

I've eaten here about 7 times and the last handful of times I've come I have had poor Quality food and service.  The last time I came I had ordered a un sweetened ice tea, I was on a sugar detox for a health reason and when the waitress who was 11 or 12 served me she gave me my tea and I took a sip and it was VERY sweet.   When she came back I said \"oh I'm sorry I thought I ordered unsweetened ice tea, could I get a new one?\"   She gave me a dirty look and said \"I gave you unsweetened\". I said oh simple mistake but it's very sweet, I cannot have sugar, may I get another?.  She stood there and kept saying she did not make a mistake.   My friend sitting with me grabbed my drink and took a sip and said this has sugar in it. Get her another.  The girl grabbed my drink gave me a smile and walked away. It then took her about 10 min to bring back my tea.   After we ate her father who I'm pretty sure is the owner came over and said \"simple mistake on the tea, can you really blame a 11 year old? And chuckled. He then made small talk about the situation. Very awkward.  Another time I came from breakfast with a friend and we found a hair in her pancake and she simply asked for another pancake. When the waiter came back he laugh and said \" oh haha some of our workers have dogs, sorry about that\". My friend and him went back and forth on this subject, let's just say she doesn't hold back words haha, we ended up leaving.   Super gross!!",

I have to say it is kind of a neighborhood place tucked away in small almost none existence shopping center with only a bar right next to it right smack dab in the middle of Mountains edge master community.   But if you do decide to make an effort it is worth it. Food is good staff is great and price is just right.

It was a Saturday morning and there was no wait, which was fantastic! The service was fast and friendly - my husband ordered an omelet and I had chicken fried steak. We also ordered something from the kids menu for our daughter. Everything was to our liking and we had no complaints. The prices are very reasonable as well!

If you love gravy, this is the place for you. Everything has yummy gravy! The nachos, GRAVY. I never knew chips and gravy would be a hit. The fried chicken had hints of honey, just enough sweetness to warm your belly.   All the yummy food, but only 3 stars you ask?? The service was very slow. We were 1 of 3 other families in the restaurant. I'm not sure how long the other 2 families were seated before we arrived, but their food wasn't even on the table yet. I looked at my watch a few times before our food came out - about 30 mins had passed. Also, our waitress only came out once to refill our water cups. Waiting for the check was interesting, since our waitress hadn't been out in a while. My husband ended up walking to the kitchen door to pay. Maybe this is normal? I'm not sure.",

Turned onto a semi gravel road to what looked like just a random bar but on the right was this little restaurant.  As you walk in it gives you a nice homely feeling with pictures on the wall paying respects to our armed forces, wooden tables with what looked like hand made benches from trees chopped out back and the nicest lady greeting me with the biggest smile.  Service was of course outstanding, constantly checking up on me, water always topped off and recommendations on the menu.  I went with the suggestion of the special. Chicken parmesan. The noodles were not overcooked, it was spot on, the chicken was tender and flavorful not to mention the clam chowder that came with the meal was delicious.  Honestly I cant believe this place was so close to my house and this was the first time I decided to check them out. I would have came in a lot more.",

I ordered a breakfast burrito and was it ever good!! In mine I chose eggs, hash browns, mushroom, tomato and bacon. It comes with sour cream and salsa on the side and one side of your choice. The burrito was very large and hot.   They have a large selection of breakfast and lunch options. My cousin ordered pancakes and they were huge! She said they were amazing!!  The staff is super friendly! They kept our coffee cups full and were right there making sure everything was fine.   It's located on the Southwest side of Vegas. If you are looking for a place where you can feel welcome and without the rush of Vegas, please come here. You will not be disappointed!!",

They are all young and just seemed like they didn't want to be there working. Took him more then 5 minutes to greet us and get a drink order. We will give it another try soon and hopefully our next experience can be better",

I had what I believe was the Blackjack and my boyfriend got the steak and eggs!  The steak was cooked perfectly.  Mine was scrambled eggs with hashbrowns and 2 pieces of bacon and 2 sausage links.  No substitutions.  I don't eat Sausage but I couldn't do more bacon but that was ok.  We had lots of coffee, they ensured our coffee was full at all times!

We waited about 5-7 minuets for them to have a table for us. (That's another thing if there are 4 people don't sit at a table for more than 4.) It took about 4 min to have someone take our drink order and another 4-5 min for our food order. Food for the most part was alright. 3 out of 5 orders were good. 1 order was chicken-n-waffles, don't trust it the chicken was chicken fingers and the waffle was really well done even burnt. 1 order was sent back due to asking for no salt on the fires. We where there for about an hour. Service seemed to be understaffed. LOVE the size of their soda cups. Out of the 4 adults we gave it a score of 13 out of 20 stars (combined total of 5 stars each). We'll have to come back on another day to see if it was a fluke about service and food orders.",

    "text": "This is a random little home cooking spot in the middle of Mountain's Edge attached to the Bounty Tavern.   If you like anything that's cooked with love and tastes like Grandma's house, you should totally stop by.  We love coming here as a family for a few reasons:  1) We can all find things we like to eat... Variety is key here and you can get breakfast lunch or dinner items at all times. You want chicken fried steak? no problem. You want a healthy meal? No problem they have a protein platter, wraps or salad. Homemade cobbler or a milkshake? Covered.  2) Staff is always very sweet. The place is family-owned. There is always a great special of the day and a separate kids meal they can color on.  3) Kids eat for free on Tuesday... Which means I have extra money for a cocktail from The Bar Next Door   4) This place is super close to our house and never disappoints us. We tend to bring family here when they come into town.  5) There is a lot of cool touches to this place inclusive of hanging your favorite coffee cup on the wall and an entire shelf of games you can play while you eat or wait for your order.  A couple things you should know... if you do order alcohol it comes from a bar and you have to pay a separate tab because they are owned by a separate company. No big deal. this place also gets crazy busy for breakfast on the weekends so plan ahead!",

It is very old school country diner which seems to awake sense of nostalgia for my husband who grew up in WI and was accustomed to mom and pop type places. We typically go during the week before work and craziness of the day consumes us. It is usually pretty quiet, and it is nice to have a cozy booth and focus on having some time together while indulging in delicious breakfast fare. I have tried their traditional breakfast, ham and eggs, corned beef hash and chicken fried steak. Their chicken fried steak is drool worthy, with corned beef hash coming in close 2nd.  The service is adequate but not very personable which is kind of contradictory to the whole theme of the restaurant. Your coffee and water will be refilled in timely manner, you will be checked in on occasionally -- pretty standard stuff. The restaurant is nestled away in heart of Mountains Edge or Southern Highland... it's that darn Cactus bridge that always throws me off. It is a small lot with ample parking located next to Bounty's bar. Overall, I would suggest this place for breakfast, especially over chains like Cracker Barrel that my husband loves out of sheer nostalgia.",

She ordered the nightly special and it had been plated first and had been sitting while our food was cooking. She asked for a new plate. They took it back and MICROWAVED it!! She asked the server and she looked confused so my mom asked for another new plate that was not microwaved. The owner/manager came out and slammed the plate down. My mom went to eat her food when she realized she only had one piece of meat and not two that the special comes with. At this point there was no fixing our order. She asked the server to remove it from the bill. The owner/manager then came out removed her plate and took it to the kitchen where he SLAMMED it all in the trash! Where everyone on her side of the table could see. It was so embarrassing! He and his wife never apologized. His wife came out to ask why she sent the plate back and all she did was cover his back. She never accept responsibility for their mistakes or actions and placed all blame on us.   Let's just say we will never been dining at this establishment again. If you want to be treated like crap and then still have to pay go here. BIRTHDAY DINNER RUINED!",

I love everything about all the little details of giving that vibe.   We were greeted and seated right away, which is a huge plus, especially on a Sunday. The menu had pictures that made us indecisive, wanting to try all things on the menu. The staff are very attentive and friendly! We ended up ordering the Country Fried steak and my son and I shared the French Toast platter. The portions are huge and everything was flavorful. The mimosa was made strong, as it should be. Hehe. We also made a last minute decision of ordering the Apple pie. Seriously, the best apple pie I ever had! Soooo delicious!  Another really cool thing about this place is they offer toys and a bunch of crayons for kids...I love this idea so much, anything to keep my son from his iPad!   Thank you Our Families Country Cafe for starting off our Sunday off right...we will be back real soon to try other things on the menu.",

First of all, their homemade vegetable soup was just absolutely delicious - I ended up eating the entire cup (even though my sister was the one that ordered it).  Also, they have the BEST chicken fried steak and gravy - to DIE for *drools* I've been dreaming of going back ever since that first visit.  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.",

It was a full house! (It is a very small place) The staff was very friendly, food came out quickly and was quite good! My husband got the chicken fried steak and eggs.  He said the batter was crispy, steak wasn't tough, and the gravy was excellent.  I got the ham steak and eggs.  Ham steak was one of the best I've had. Glad I got the 1/2 order!  We also got the buscuits and gravy only because someone on Yelp said they were the best ever.  They were quite good! I don't know about the best ever, but we cleaned the plate! I like that you could get buscuits and gravy instead of toast at no extra charge. I wish we lived closer, but it's quite a drive for us coming from Summerlin.  Next time we are in that area though, we will definitely be stopping by there again.",

We ordered fried chicken, and the portions were generous, but the chicken was pretty tasteless.  The mashed potatoes were called \"real,\" but I don't believe it.  And the canned green beans were horrible.  The bread was good.  The worst was the \"homemade clam chowder.\"  Really??  My guess is that Smart and Final sells a cream base to which was added some canned clams.  That is not homemade.  I cook better and use fresher ingredients than this supposed \"country\" restaurant.  Did love the little boy who refilled our iced tea.  All around service was great.",

I was looking through my Entertainment coupon book for a new place to try, and I am always looking for a good home cooking type restaurant.  This is it!  The first time I went, I was planning on having the Chicken Fried Steak because a lot of the reviews I read said it was really good, and I'm always looking for a good CFS.  The special that night was an open face turkey sandwich, so I decided to get that instead.  It was very good, came with mashed potatoes, dressing, green beans and choice of soup or salad.  Everything was great.  On my second visit, I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak....it's amazing!  So tender that I didn't need a knife to cut it.  The mashed potatoes are homemade....little chunks of whole potato in them.  The dinner rolls they serve are the best ever!  I had leftovers and asked if I could have another roll to take home to eat with my leftovers, and was gladly given one.  We talked with the owner of the place for a little bit, super nice guy!  If you are looking for good down home country cooking, this is the place.  Looking forward to trying breakfast here soon.",

    "text": "I gave three stars because the food was really good. Table manners were BAD. When we walked in, we were told to take the last table as a party was sitting at the \"last\" table. So we had to figure out the puzzle on our own - still had an open mind. I did observe the people who were probably regular customers being treated like royalty which is a good sign they have a heart somewhere. They knew their names and waited on them hand over fist. It took quite a bit for anyone to take our order or pay us attention. We had to flag someone down to ask who our server was and she was very friendly. Food came out quickly - good. Taste was very good. We never got drink refills or periodic check ups once we were served our food. I will return because it looks like you have to go several times in order to receive decent service. Even my daughter said they aren't very nice here and normally a kid could care less or even notice the service. I think the service flaw was due to lack of organization on the floor. There were plenty of people working, but all over the place. This place has enormous potential and influence to be amazing. Be nice to the new-comers too. We like to be repeat customers as well.",

The basket of friend chips were the best I've had (people tend to slice them too thin and they are nothing but grease...these you could taste the potato and they were cooked to perfection).  I had the quesadilla with the best salsa I've ever eaten...very fresh and not too hot...just perfect for me.  My friend had the shrimp basket ... excellent quality and taste there as well.  It was a \"to go\" order, and the young male server was friendly and courteous.  Outdoor seating in this quaint place...if you are going to Red Rock or the state park out Blue Diamond...just turn south on Buffalo (Rainbow is having construction), past Mountain's Edge Parkway (there will be a park on the left) and then left on Cactus (you will see their placard on the right edge of Buffalo at Cactus) and go till it dead ends about 1/4 mile on the right..  WELL worth experiencing this different relaxed country homestyle feel of Vegas.  Very good experience.",

We expected to prove that it wasn't \"Real\" Country cookin' cause of course it isn't in Mississippi......well, It was so good it makes you wanna slap yer mama!! Everything was so amazing that after dreaming about it all night, we decided to go back for breakfast! Any place that cooks real grits is the place for us! It was like a REAL country breakfast and by this time, we had all gained at least 5 pounds....... once you start eating, do NOT think you will be able to leave anything on your plate (and don't worry if you didn't save room for dessert..... just cram it in anyway cause the peach cobbler is sinful)! As if dinner, breakfast and the need to buy stretchy pants weren't enough, we decided we needed to go for dinner again tonight! Well, stretchy pants be damned.... it is WORTH the fashion faux pas! If you haven't yet eaten at the Country Cafe, well shame on you..... Get on over there and enjoy.....and don't forget your stretchy pants!!!!",

The waitress always takes the time to make sure everything is going great. They know all of our names and our drinks are on the table right when we walk in.  My family eats there once a week for breakfast and usually have food delivered once a week for dinner.  Every single menu item that my husband and I have ordered has been fabulous, we haven't found one thing that we wouldn't eat over and over.  Every night of the week they have special for dinner and the best special is the Spaghetti and meat sauce, it is excellent. The decor is also great, makes you feel like you're right at home and not at a restaurant, especially during the holidays. During Easter they even do a egg hunt for the kids, raffle off prizes and have a bouncy house that my daughter is still asking about. We've been visiting this restaurant since they opened and will definitely continue!!",

It's become our go-to place for weekend dinner delivery (and the occasional weeknight,) although we've also eaten at the restaurant for breakfast a few times. It's super cute inside, and was really decorated homey for Christmas. Service is great and delivery is fast, prices are reasonable. I dont think we've ever had a bad meal here. Their fish and chips are amazing, especially their chips! Steaks are great, soups, burgers, sandwiches, shrimp basket, fries, clam chowder and other soups all have been good as well. Husband loves the Salmon Dinner Special and Steak/Shrimp Dinner Special. The only meal I wasn't super crazy about was their Chicken Parmesan Special, just seemed like they slapped on marinara sauce over otherwise battered chicken - no parmesan breadcrumbs and definitely not cheesy enough. And I haven't even mentioned the breakfast... So GOOD! Even with delivery, everything arrives hot and tasty. Their biscuits and gravy are one of my favs, eggs, bacon, sausage. You just can't go wrong with Our Families Country Cafe!",

Our Families Country Cafe is a diner the way it should be, with real comfort food breakfast through dinner.  The portions are big and the prices are more than reasonable.

The restaurant is super duper tiny and decorated like the stereotypical \"country\" fashion, and the food is very homey.  I tried country fried steak for the first time at the Country Cafe, and am I glad I tried it here!  The food was burning and super hearty.  Suprisingly, the fried steak stayed crunchy beneath the thick gravy.  My favorite, though, were the home fries.  Oh my goodness the homefries!  I don't know what they did to these red-skinned potatoes of salty goodness, but they cooked them beyond good!  I would get a whole plate of these only if I could.  I loved everything about the cafe except for the service.  I am guessing there is only one cook in the back because service is really slow.  Don't expect a quick meal and don't come in super duper hungry because the food takes awhile to come out.  The cafe is small though, so it's understandable that food isn't coming out like Cooking Dash.",

As it is now, they maintain the same high quality whether I am one of a few patrons or they get a surge of 10 tables. My hat is off to them.  The proof is in quality of the patrons also. We know a good place and we stick by it. I have no favorite from the menu. It is all superb.",

And dessert traditionals like apple pie, and hot fudge sundaes. The food does have that country hometown feel which aside from being delicious makes you feel at home. All it's missing is a large family table full of the Waltons so I can ask someone to pass the mash.",

And I eat every bite.  Also, I noticed everyone was complaining about the sarcastic waitress, but seriously lighten up. I love her. She laughs every time I order my mountain of food, but it's all in good fun. (: I love this place so much, I'm going today!",

    "text": "After living in Mountain's Edge for over 4 years we didn't become aware of this place until a couple of months ago. The owner said they had been there about the same amount of time we had been living here which surprised me. They are a well-kept secret which I'm sure the owners would like to change but suits me just fine. I always want to have a table available when I walk in!  Yes, you do seat your self and the wait staff can seem a bit surly but I attribute it to their being busy all the time. Its a small place with nice country ambience but it seems to be bursting at the seams with patrons all the time. I can't blame them for forgetting to smile now and then.  The Families Country Cafe is truly a family affair, with sons, daughters, sister, brothers, mothers and fathers all lending a hand. So even if you're not greeted immediately you will still get that down home feeling.  My favorite meal of the day is breakfast and that is what my wife and I had. I ordered a simple sausage and egg breakfast while my wife got the 2 step breakfast. When my order arrived I was a bit disappointed in the portions but I did not feel that way when I was done. There was plenty to fill my hearty appetite and my wife couldn't even finish hers. The food was delicious, too, by the way, especially the home fries. My sausage links were not the iddy biddy splinters of meat you might get at chain restaurants but were big, juicy and very tasty. Even the toast was superior.  It is a bit hard to find but forget google maps and give the restaurant a call for directions. Its more than worth a taste.",

I have been here a couple of times for lunch recently, and it appears the country fried steak sandwich is one of their specialties.  It was very good, and not overly salty.  For my second lunch here, I had a Philly burger.  It was good, but kind of subdued compared to other Philly burgers I have had. As it is fairly close to my office, I hope to make it back here once or twice a month.  However, if you are not in this part of town, I wouldn't say you should go out of you way to get to this cafe.  As a neighborhood cafe, I give it a solid 4 stars!",

Indeed they were busy, but pumping out various combos of eggs/sausage/pancakes/biscuits should be the faintest of a line cooks worries. Food arrived and was as average as it gets...gravy was good but biscuits were overcooked on the bottoms, sausage was tasty but the pancakes were too \"griddle crispy\" for my liking.

Like others have said, it's difficult to locate as it's hidden within Mountain's Edge. Once you find it, you will definitely be back again.  So far I've tried the Chicken Fried Steak and the Corned Beef Hash which are mouthwateringly good. The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. I can honestly say this place makes the best Chicken Fried Steak ever.  The place is family owned and the service is warm and friendly.

I had the Two Step Breakfast (2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausages, and choice of 2 pancakes or toast) $7.75. Hubby had the very delicious biscuits and gravy. Both were served with \"batter bites\" crispy, well flavored potato nuggets of bliss.   The waitress was super nice. I would love to go back soon since I noticed there was fresh baked pie on the menu. She even said they deliver. Check out their website!  My only star knock off is the fact that they inundate you with country music. Ok, I know the restaurant has \"country\" in it's name, but I really do not appreciate the twang.

    "text": "This place sure is hidden!! We heard about this place when I was going through my coupons, and decided to try it out since it was buy one get one. Honestly, it was a little overdone. The place looked so cluttered with decorations, it was almost overkill.   The coffee was decent, and food was alright, nothing spectacular. The service is why this is only getting 3 stars, and not 4... it was HORRIBLE. Our server came over to our table and seemed like she was in a rush - except there were only 3 other tables there. She took our order so quick and abrupt that it was almost like if you didn't have a quick answer for her, she would yell at you! She never explained the difference between batter bits and home fries, so we each just got one. She never came back to ask us how we were doing, until the end of the meal when she handed us our check.  I ordered chicken fried steak, and my man got the pork chops with eggs. Both were good... like I said before, nothing out of the ordinary, and definitely not bad, just not memorable. Also, the only difference between the batter bites, and home fries was with or without peppers and onions. And WHY are they called batter bites anyways?? Makes it seem like it should be pancakes, or something with BATTER not potatoes with peppers/onions.   This place has so much potential, but it's just missing the mark. Get better service, and de-clutter your brand new restaurant, and maybe it would be more inviting, and make us want to come back.",

    "text": "Other reviewers are correct, this place is hard to find, but if you go south onto  Buffalo (from Blue Diamond) and proceed East onto Cactus to the end of the road, this place is on the right side.  I want to give it another star, but the service and quality of my entree prohibits me from doing so.  We entered the restaurant and waited several minutes before we were acknowledged.  OK its Friday night and there are only to two other tables of diners.  We finally got our drink orders by very courteous young man who was efficient.   We were given children's menus also.    It appeared that our server, Jason, was also one of the owners.  At first I was a bit puzzled (put off) by his demeanor which would be perfectly acceptable at \"Dick's Last Resort\" but here?  I was trying to give him the benefit of a doubt that maybe he has a real dry sense of humor, since he seemed to be well liked by any regular that walked in and he would chat with them quite a bit.  Not sure if he has the \"Diligaf\" attitude also about not trying to make new customers feel just as welcome, but we dd not get that feeling from him.    Onto the entrees:  I had the fried chicken dinner.  Not bad, the chicken was definitely cooked in oil that was too hot, since the chicken had a dark brown hard crust.  It was bit salty too.  The menu, describes you getting a drumstick, thigh and breast for $10.49.  The pieces of chicken reminded me, size wise, of what you get from a box of Banquet frozen fried chicken in your local grocer's frozen food dept.  My wife ordered the Rib Eye steak sandwich which she enjoyed and would order again.  She thought the macaroni salad was ok and did not finish it.  Jason noticed this when he cleared her plate and asked her in an unpleasant  manner if she thought here was something wrong with his macaroni salad:  she told him no, she was just full from the sandwich.  I would like to try the breakfasts here, based on the other reviews, but at this point, I'm unsure.",

Everyone I have taken to this resturant loves it! It is very good food, and it's a lovely little hidaway resturant that is sooo very worth the trip there! Look out for the deserts!!!

Trust me, they're different - one is cow and the other is chicken. Instead of fixing the order he says I hope you don't mind, but it seems the cook made the wrong thing. He puts the plate on the table and walks away. I was hungry and figured I'd be nice and not make a big deal. I ate the food but when the check came it was too high. He charged for cheesiness my eggs. Many places do this but they always ask first, \"that will be extra $, is that okay?\" I would have been fine but after charging me for the wrong meal this was the last straw. I asked why the bill was so high and he said \"other places charge extra. Of course you know that.\" At that point I just wanted to get out. I left a generous tip but that's just habit and frankly now I wish I hadn't. You can try their food but beware of these things and make sure they get your order right. I'll never return to this place.",

Three of us went in Sunday morning around 10 for breakfast and I wasn't  in the mood for the delicious Chicken Fried steak they serve so i just opted for Sausage and eggs. Really cheap sub- Jimmy Dean quality sausage patties and cold toast(sourdough that I think was plain white) were both a bummer. Also it took about 45 mins for get our food which seemed excessive considering there were only 3 tables occupied when we arrived. The server lady is super laid back and friendly but also forgot my GF's coffee creamer and brought me the wrong potatoes. Plus her omlette was super dry and over cooked, I tasted it.  Overall just barely passable, without the Groupon a real misstep. It's unfortunate because this is a cool spot with friendly people and nice atmosphere...the food and service are beggining to lag IMO.",

    "text": "My husband & I went to this place due to a groupon I found for it. The groupon deal was good, the food was good, but the service was HORRIBLE!! I've definitely experienced better. First, the drive to this place was coo-coo! We almost thought this place didn't exist. My husband thought it was a \"groupon scam\" but we finally found it. I kinda wished we hadn't though. As I said before, the food was good, but the service was NOT!! It all started w/the tall, dark-haired guy that greeted us at the door; he spoke in a monatone & he had no personality whatsoever. :(  Then, our server, a full-figured, blond-haired lady, came to take our order, & when she saw that we had a groupon, she gave a weird, attitudy look; a look that said, \"Oh great, some more cheap-skates that only came here for the groupon deal\". She had so much attitude, she definitely needs an attitude adjustment. Then, it took so long to get our food. Eventhough they were busy, it took FOREVER to get our food. We only ordered some common breakfast meals. My husband got the bacon & eggs w/sourdough toast & batter bites, which are only seasoned cubed potatoes that are crispy. I got a denver omelette, homefried potatoes, which have onions & bell peppers, w/biscuits & gravy. The biscuits were good but the gravy was very peppery & had no sausage, which it usually would have. The only good service we got was by the two guys who kept checking on us, about our drinks mainly, but they were cool still. We over-heard our server curse in the kitchen about all the people who were coming in w/all the groupons. I thought if they don't want people to come visit their restaurant w/groupons, then they shouldn't put their restaurant on the groupon website. I would only recommend this place for the food, but not for the service.",

My son, who has sensory issues and a resistance to new foods and smells, was extremely at home here.  He even complimented the waitress on his meal.  We had three different meals and I tasted each one of them.  And, each was equally delicious.  I discovered this place through groupon and almost felt embarrassed to use the groupon knowing the food was worth every penny.  I'm now looking forward to bringing my visitors to this location so they too can get a home cooked meal away from HOME...off the beaten path... and not pay an arm and a leg to for a great meal.  Well worth the discovery.",

Despite it not being busy, we counted at least 10 employees. Also, 'our families' implies more than one but it's only one family so it should be 'our family's'? I asked about who the 'families plural' are and was told 'we consider everyone who comes to be family, so it's everyone's families place'. Mmhmm. Anywho, the food is good and portions good sized. Boyfriend got a meal and a coke, I got a small sized version of a meal and water and it was $30. That seems a bit much, but, like I said the food was good, so, at least that money is supporting a local, family place. I just hope an ihop or Denny's doesn't open nearby or else I fear they'd go under. I think my favorite thing was that the breakfast ham was grilled. Everywhere else I've had breakfast ham it's griddle/skillet cooked. Here it's grilled and has the lines and tastes a tiny bit like grill char. Which, if you like grilled meat, you know what I'm talkin about. It was good!",

Excellent choice to take you first date, family or your beautiful wife.  Great place.  Dessert is -- oh my gosh-- good",

Waited for someone to acknowledge us when they finally did they act like it's no big deal. We waited another 45 minutes  to take our order. Never came back to check on us or even refill our drinks . When they finally check on us, they spilled coffee on the silverware I asked for new ones. The server had an attitude Came back and slammed it on the table. We waited another 45 minutes no food. Couldn't take it anymore and left. I understand being busy I worked in customer service industry but that was the worst and would not recommend this place ever!!",

At the end of the meal I said \"who is our server?\" Because the entire time we were never talked to by anyone. Every time we told someone in the restaurant something we needed, they ignored it and never brought it. We got our food finally after 20 minutes of waiting and the fries come out cold. This place has terrible service. Once I told someone to go get my server because i was very upset, she wanders over after another 15 minutes and says \"I thought that's all you wanted.\" And looked at me funny. She finally brings the bill over that I was asking for after so long. She didn't even say thank you or anything. She slammed the check on the table and stormed off. I can't believe this lady #ONESTAR",

There fries used to be wedge like and the best fries Ive ever eaten. Well I got home with my food and the fries were cold and straight not wedgelike and they had a overpowering season on them. I was very disappointed they changed the fries. And the burger was burnt, the lettece was soggy. Needless to say I threw half the burger away.  I can saw I am extrememly disappointed how the food has changed lately. I used to come here alot but after this I wont be returning as often.",

    "text": "1) Location was in a neighborhood setting, but really easy to find.  2) As soon as you step in you feel a nice little comfort about the place.  3) Seating was quick and painless, we got the last booth and it was busy.  4) Offered a cinnamon roll, but I wasn't craving, but when people did order them they looked nice and completely fresh out of the oven.  5) Got our drinks right away. And they topped off our water all the time. 6) Ordered our food. Average wait time for food to come out, it was about 10-15 minutes.  7) FOOD WAS AMAZING. We both got Chicken Fried Steak with home style potatoes, over medium eggs, AND Biscuits and Gravy for $10.99!!!! Chicken fried steak was soooo crispy and juicy and smothered with their yummy gravy! The batter they used was absolutely delicious. The home style potatoes were well seasoned and had yummy bell peppers mixed in. Perfect over medium egg! THE BISCUITS AND GRAVY THOUGH! That is definitely a reason for you to come in and try this place out. The biscuits were so delicious that they basically melted in your mouth! And you can tell if was fresh (even if it wasn't, it was still amazing) the gravy (same gravy as on the chicken fried steak) was so good with the biscuit! I nearly licked my plate clean!  8) Bathroom experience was pleasant they really need a deep clean on the tiles, but it was clean, and didn't smell.  Our waitress accidentally charged us for our water, and before we said she already knew she made a mistake and fixed it up right away! So definitely pleased that they care about the service they are giving.   Overall I am not disappointed with this place at all, it was a great breakfast experience and definitely recommend this place to everyone! I didn't give 5 stars because I never do.",

I asked our waitress for the tuna melt, but she said they didn't have tuna that day. I was a little disappointed til she recommended the steak sandwich.  I really don't eat a lot of red meat, but I decided to give it a try.  Man, I'm glad I did.  It was delicious!  Very soft bun, melt in your mouth tender steak, and a side of huge steak fries cooked and seasoned perfectly!  My husband got breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and pancakes) and it looked good too.  He chowed his whole meal and tasted my sandwich and said the same thing I had about the steak \"Man, that thing is tasty!\"    Needless to say, we will be back.  I can't believe all the reviews that say they had bad service.  Everyone was very nice and attentive when we were there.  I hope it wasn't a fluke.  We will see next time we go.  =)",

    "text": "03/23/13 DINNER  I was tempted to give this place only 1 star, but since the owner/server was a nice guy, I went with 2 stars.  On 02/27/12 spouse and I had dinner here. We brought a GROUPON along, and as it turned out, it was worth the long drive and price for what we had. Spouse really liked the chicken fried chicken.  So a few months ago a repeat of the GROUPON was offered. I got one.  Well, we were extremely disappointed this time. It had a few ups, but mostly downs.  We came this night for their announced Saturday night special, which I will copy verbatim from their Facebook page: IT'S SATURDAY MARCH 23rd AND....TODAY'S SPECIAL IS....ROASTED TURKEY BREAST WITH DARRELL'S HOMEMADE CORNBREAD STUFFING (THIS IS DELISH!!) SERVED WITH FRESH MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY(made from the drippings mm mm good) VEGETABLE, DINNER ROLL AND CHOICE OF HOMEMADE SOUP OR CRISP GREEN SALAD!!!  We arrived. I saw a sign at the front door announcing \"Saturday & Sunday only, check in with Facebook and get unlimited mimosas for $10 or half priced bloody marys\". I said to myself, Why Not?, and proceeded to check in. I showed my phone to the owner/server (Darrell?), and he said \"Oh, that's only offered at brunch, and as I don't own the bar, I can't make that offer for dinner.\" It's a tavern with him (Darrell?) subleasing the restaurant side of the building. That's fair enough. (It's similar to what Carluccio's did, moving from the Liberace center to a Henderson tavern.) But he (Darrell?) proceeded to bring us a free basket of fried mozzarella sticks, which was very nice of him (Darrell?), and were actually pretty good.  We got the bloody marys after all, and it was one of the worst I've ever had. Why? For one, my olive was previously attacked by a bug (no lie, a chunk bit out of it, obviously insect-eaten) and the cocktail tasted metallic. I probably should've returned it, but then there were those free moz sticks, sitting there...  After ordering said Saturday night special, next up were cup of soup or salad. I got the homemade chili, which was good. Spouse got the salad, and was quite happy. It even had dandelion greens. In the 2.25 years of living here in Vegas I don't think we've seen those in a salad. (Was it a packaged salad? If it was, it was surprising.)  But then the main course comes. It was not turkey BREAST, it was turkey LOAF. Lots of white and grey-dark meat, sliced from a loaf, perfectly circular, falling to pieces. It was OK, but it wasn't anything special, or worth the price charged. And the \"veg\", the green beans, we forgot about this part from the last visit, they were sadly canned. Remaining was some cranberry sauce (OK, likely canned, no problem), the potatoes (a small scoop of homemade, these were good), the dressing (also seemed homemade, good) and the gravy (which I think wasn't from \"drippings\" because the last time I cooked a turkey loaf I don't recall all that many drippings, so we think it was bottled/packaged). The dinner roll was a version of texas toast, no garlic, just a grilled roll.  Didn't order the homemade, just out of the oven, peach cobbler, offered by the owner/server (Darrell?). We promptly left after dinner. A lot of the turkey loaf came home for the kitties.  If I hear they've improved, we might again make the trip out there. But I doubt that will happen.  PS One other problem. We arrived to find a couple of uncontrolled kids running around the VERY SMALL restaurant, at times screaming. It continued throughout most of our visit. I guess the word \"Families\" in the name of the place should've been a clue of the possibility of an undesired child \"carnival\", supplied by their uncaring-of-other-patrons parents. (At the same age as those kids, if I had behaved that way in a restaurant with my Navy Commander father at the table, I would've been beaten to a pulp. Times have certainly changed.)",

I have had a good time in a couple recent visits with friends visiting town. The staff is courteous and has a good energy, the coffee is good and in many cases you can find a mobile car wash company in the lot so you can leave your car washing while you eat. Pretty convenient I thought.   Very hard to get to since it sits at a dead end road but I guess the road is opening up soon to Rainbow Blvd so it will be a breeze getting there once you can drive right through Rainbow. You have to take S. Buffalo and left on Cactus till you hit the dead end road and it's to your right.   Anyways, if you're in the area or live nearby its a cool place to go to for breakfast.",

But man did they come through, its a small place which gives it a nice warm feeling. The decorator needs a nice round of applause also.   Once you find it ( take your time ) its a small treasure. The owner can at first seem a bit on the rough side but he truly cares and will fire sarcasm right back at you.   The drinks are huge and they wont go empty on you. They have very well put together menu for all three meal times. And there nightly specials are a great deal.   Its clean and has a tunnel ( ok hallway ) the the bar next door which they often run drink specials with.   I have been several times now and had a good sampling of the menu i have yet to find anything I did not like. And if you ask real nice they will bring you a sample of the sides if your not sure about them.  I took my granddaughter with me a few times she is only 10 months but I was surprised to find they have baby spoons available if you forget yours.. how cool is that.   Now a secret well ok not a huge one But they close at 9pm, But the menu is still available till 2am at the bar next door, good thing for those late night munchies.   If you haven't been then its worth a trip there, but if your looking for one of those places where they kiss your butt you wont find it.. Grab your own table and enjoy.",

    "text": "Finally got around to trying this place after having living in Mtn's Edge for 1.5 years. Wish I had tried it sooner. Food was very good, family of servers were very polite and friendly.   Pros: Food was very good, big portions. Food came out pretty quick, drinks always full. Staff was very friendly, you could tell there were a lot of regulars there because they were really buddy buddy with a few tables. It truly is family owned and family run, which is nice.  Cons: Terrible location, hard to find and not near anything. Inconsiderate jerk smokers right outside the front entrance when the door was open, made the whole place stink, I had to say something before they closed the door but the damage had already been done. Place is kind of small so I imagine there would be a long wait during busy times.  We will definitely be back since food and service were so good.",

Country music, rough around the edges, decor from Hobby Lobby--you betcha.   After I found the place, which is actually located on Cactus, I walked in and knew I was going to love it. Breakfast is served all day, so when I saw the pancake sandwich I had to get it even though it was 1pm.   The sandwich part is a little misleading. I would call it more of an open faced sandwich, with all the breakfast fixins piled on top, and it was as delicious as any breakfast from the small town of my youth. Syrup and sausage and pancakes and eggs all rolled into one not-McGriddle is okay by me.   I can't say that I will be back anytime soon due to its distance from me and how difficult it was to find, but I am glad to know it exists if I ever get a hankering for not-Vegas Midwestern country cooking.",

You could tell who the regulars were and the man and woman filling drinks couldn't give to squirts about us. We had to ask several times for coffee refills and water refills, and when we did we honestly felt like we were putting them out.    The food was just ok, nothing that screamed I gotta come back and try this dish or get this dish again. I got the the pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuit and gravy, and ham. The bacon was perfect crispy and dry (how I like it) the pancakes and biscuit were dry and tasted of flour. The sausage was good..standard patties. Gravy I liked he flavor, the ham was disgusting and full of fat and gristle.     The location is kind off the beaten path, and with the just ok food and the bad service I personally see no reason to come back.",

    "text": "This had to be one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. If I could leave negative stars I would! We came here because there's really not too many choices in Mountains Edge and saw that there was a Groupon available. The location is obscure and kind of hidden. We walked in and it was pretty empty, there could only be a few reasons why. Too late? Nope, it was 7:30pm. Poor location? Yes. Competition? Noooo. Bad food and service? Hope not. Unfortunately bad food and service were the main culprits.  We were greeted quickly, but being one of only 3 tables I would hope so. The menu was pretty sparse. My husband ordered the \"Tuesday\" special and I opted for the Ham Steak with mashed potatoes. It came with Cream of Turkey soup, which was by far the only edible thing I had. The soup came out and not even 2 bites later our entire meal came out. Not a good sign! It looked decent so I finished my soup and started in to the meal. I stuck my fork in my mashed potatoes and I felt a \"crunch\"! I pulled out a big black mystery chunk of something. It was the size of a blueberry. I put it to the side of the plate and quit eating the potatoes. I tried a few bites of the ham steak and it was dry and tasted like it was cooked directly on charcoal. The waitress came by and I showed her the mystery chunk. She looked down, picked it up and squeezed it between her fingers!!! No lie! Who does that???  She looked at it and said I have no idea what that was. Well, that made me feel better! :/ I asked her to just bring me some fries. They were ok. She came with the bill and said she took 10% off for the mashed potatoes. I told her I had a Groupon and she said, well I guess I'll put the 10% back on! This lady had issues. This restaurant had serious issues! We will NOT be back. Worst ever!",

I didn't mind the zig-zagging through neighborhoods to find them, I actually enjoyed the scavenger hunt. (Kudos to the person who thought of putting signs out on the road guiding lost people to your restaurant!)  My issue came at the time sat ourselves down to order. We weren't welcomes by a hostess (you seat yourself) but our waiter didn't come by for a good 5 mins and the place only had 4-5 busy tables. When he did show up, he didn't even look at us directly. He asked for our orders like we were his construction buddies and annoyed with us dinning there. Exact words \"what will have today\".. last time I checked this was not polite. I wasn't done with placing my order and he moved onto my girlfriend to place her order. I interrupted him as he started walking away to ask for a side item (which showed up on my friends plate when we got our food).   Little things matter Country Cafe. As simply as being welcoming a guest into an establishment goes a long way. Your place is grandma's house cute, but the food was ok and the service we sub par. Maybe you should target construction workers not families and neighbors as your customer base. Or better yet, get rid of the tall, 230 lb, dark haired waiter and hire a well-mannered person with some hospitality skills to replace him. Then maybe some customers would come back.",

The wait was pretty quick but the food was nothing special. The highlight of the meal was the cinnamon roll. Other than that the corned beef hash was blah and average, French toast was basic French toast. Won't be back. I'm sure most don't view this as a positive but the guy running the door was entertaining in the fact that he had absolutely no personality. He was completely dry and looked like he'd rather be anywhere else. When he barked out our name for our table being ready he literally then just pointed across the room to the booth that was open then walked away. It was so bad it was comical.",

    "text": "I was in the general area and stopped here for breakfast.  This has been a bookmark for over a year and now I have one less.  I felt guilty taking up a four top dining alone but this is a relatively small place with no counter and no two tops.  I was brought coffee quickly.  They offer you Half and Half in flavors but since I drink my coffee black, that's nice to have available but it doesn't affect me.  I ordered the Wisconsin Omelette with rye toast and batter bites for my potato.  The omelette was OK but all I saw and tasted was some sliced cheddar like I'd buy in a big bag at any grocery.  There was no pepper jack nor Swiss cheese that I could discern.  Had I read the menu a little more carefully, I wouldn't have been disappointed by the batter bites.  Look at the words and what do you think?  The batter bites were in fact home fries.  There's no batter to them.  The menu describes them as fried seasoned potatoes.  I was thinking of something more in the tater tot line but that was not the case.  My coffee was refilled without asking and there were always servers going around asking about refills.  I hurried to finish because the place was getting busy again and I wanted to let someone with a larger party have the table.  An OK place but not a return to place.  It's out of the way for me and just not worth it.    Batter bites?  That's going to bother me for some time to come.",

First, upon ordering I was told that the home fries couldn't be done crispy. Then when I asked her to have them deep fried, she said they couldn't. After that we had several different servers, our orders all came out several minutes apart, and by the time everyone got their food it had been almost an hour! I was ready to walk out. Maybe we just caught them on a bad day, maybe they perpetually are like this. To come in from out of state, to drive 25 minutes from downtown to visit a highly rated restaurant, this experience was really disappointing. The manager did give us 20% off, which is better than nothing, but for the time we waited and the really.....not necessarily nice but not rude, staff, I felt like they could've done better than 20%.",

There are so many things wrong with this one situation I won't even bother to tell you about the other times I've been here and the food was mediocre at best.

We ordered the scrambled eggs--they were dense and overcooked to the point of being brown. We also had the home fries and hot cakes. The home fries were so incredibly salty it made our mouths burn and we couldn't eat them. The hot cakes had a rubbery texture and much like the biscuits and gravy, didn't taste homemade. This girls from the south! I know my gravy!  Moving on to our two eggs over easy--one of the eggs had a busted yoke so it was cooked through in the center. The cook artfully disguised his mistake with extra salty home fries--which I want to note I didn't order. I asked for the fried potatoes. The fried potatoes were also crazy salty and couldn't be eaten.   Top all of this bad food off with even worse service--the waiter was just rude. Didn't ask how the food was...didn't ask to refill waters...didn't greet us...didn't smile...etc. I don't think we'll be back. Merp.",

Bird seed. The cold, sad, vomited remains of a Little Caesar's Hot-N-Ready. All things I would rather EAT than ever even have to LOOK at the slop they charged $40+ to serve us. I honestly don't know how this place is still standing!! Maybe they actually serve secret edible food to the \"regulars?\"  Appalling service, as others have mentioned. Disgusting, bland, straight from the box/can/freezer but still takes 45 minutes to get on your table and served cold. My boyfriend ordered a steak and I think I had chicken? With green beans (canned)? Idk. Was that gravy? I'm still trying to figure it out!  Plus every time we tried to order something (that was ON the menu) on a TUESDAY night (we were the only customers in there), the \"waitress\" just said \"we don't have that.\"  \"We're all out.\"  \"The blender is broken.\"  \"Trust me you don't NEED steak sauce for this steak.\" (Because they don't have any.)  And I had to write quotations around the word \"waitress\" because it'd be laughable and insulting to other servers to call someone who flings plates on your table, then the check, without more than two words-- a \"waitress.\"  It was ridiculous. I'm not a good cook, but I am somehow capable of \"cooking\" canned vegetables and frozen meat better than they do. And I don't buy groceries often, but I actually have more options in my pantry than they have in their \"cafe.\"  It's so sad, because with this huge population living in Mountain's Edge, we have THIS as our only option. I was hoping we would eat here once a week at LEAST! I drove home with my boyfriend feeling like a prostitute-- cheap, used, near-vomiting for being forced to swallow that, a bit dizzy, and wondering \"how did I just get royally f***ed that hard, and what can I do about it?\"  I guess leave this Yelp review...",

First I walked in and the sign said \" please wait to be seated\". So I stood there and waited. The old guy server walked by me 3 times to serve a table right next to me and never said a word. There was 3 or 4 servers and a bus boy and nobody even cared I was there. So I sat myself. I waited for 5 minutes and still no acknowledgment that I was even there. Finally a server accidentally made eye contact with me and I told him I wanted water. Another 10 minutes and I placed my order. It came out pretty fast and some monoton grouch brought me my food (his name was Jason I heard).   All while I was eating there was a table with about 8 loud idiots and one even louder obnoctious server ( she was overweight missing teeth with random tattoos also heard it was Jason the monoton grouch's sister) well she showed them all the love and none stop loud banter. At one point she asked them all to turn around and flip off her brother (Jason) which of course they did!  The whole time I was there the only person who gave a crap and asked if I was ok and asked of I needed more water was the young bus boy!  He had to be 12 years old maybe and had more class and professionalism then everyone combined.  This place is a joke and if they want to be good they need to rid the big ogar meathead manager (Jason) and clean up the others appearance and hire someone who knows how to run a restaurant! And make the young bus boy manager in the future!",

She loved the country fried steak!!! She's a picky eater so that says a lot. My eggs and steak were cooked exactly like I asked them to be. The portions are big too. The service was great from the host, busser, food runner and server!   This could've been a 5 star review easily besides the fact the host asked us if we would like a cinnamon roll that came fresh out the oven right now. Cinnamon roll looked great but it was literally that only. Oh and we had a great 2.99 charge for it on our bill too. We weren't quite sure how we felt about that.   Would I return? YES!",

    "text": "We finally made it to the \"other side\" in Mountains Edge. And it was a good thing. We tried the usual Egg & I, New Day Cafe, and the Southern Highlands locals breakfast stop, Rise & Shine. But, Our Families County Cafe blew them all away.   Normally, I wouldn't bother going out to breakfast, but we had family in town. There were 8 of us. It's almost impossible to get a consensus as to what everyone wants to eat. Our party ranged in ages from 10-90. Although the restaurant doesn't take reservations, I called ahead for the large party and for handicap/elderly accommodations. On a Sunday? For 10:30am? The gentleman on the phone obliged and we had reservations for the restaurant, on a Sunday at 10:30am!!!!  We arrived, and there was no out of the ordinary fan fare going on. It was a quaint little restaurant, with booths on the right side, and several tables. My family that was in town wanted to buy some of their decorations. :D It's a country cafe, and it is great.   Food started out with a couple of warm and delicious cinnamon rolls with a regular pastry glaze. Not too sweet, just perfect. They were so soft! A great little breakfast appetizer, if you will. Our party ordered the Farmers Breakfast, Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs, Breakfast with eggs, bacon and pancakes, Omelettes, Fish & Chips (don't judge) and the Kids Chicken Fingers.  Although we waited for our food for quite a while, we were a large party, it was definitely worth the wait. There servers were friendly and worked efficiently. Our cups of coffee, soda, and sweet ice tea never went dry.   Bottom line: We will be back. Sooner, rather than later, I hope.   Thank you to the owners of \"Our Families Country Cafe\" for sharing your wonderful food and bringing a quaint cafe to the neighborhood.",

My girlfriend and I sat down at the last booth on the right; next to the kitchen. The server dropped off our menus and we ordered our food. We started talking as he walked away, I then looked to my right and was staring at a confederate flag decal. Most of us know our history well enough to understand what that symbol now represents. I thought it to be very unprofessional and insensitive. After that moment my entire experience was ruined. Being born and raised in the south the whole idea of a country bar sounded amazing! Get the taste of back home just a few miles from my house. Who would have known that it came with a side of racist culture. I decided to be a gentleman and, since I already ordered, continue on with my meal. Again, the food was decent but I will not be going back.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Taste - The rib-eye steak sandwich was pretty good, but their BBQ burger is what will keep me coming back. Also, their seasoned fries were delicous too.        - Service - It might be because we came in after a group of 12, but it took an hour for us to order and get our food.        - Location - It's pretty hard to find. The address on google maps points you elsewhere. If you go east from Buffalo Dr and Cactus Ave, it's where the road ends. **Ordered**        - $8.95 Rib-Eye Steak Sandwich - Steak was a little thin, but very flavorful (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A?select=lXru8IuEhgR41KQtOa0Dow\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fW7S...</a>).        - $7.99 Cowboy Burger - One of the best BBQ burgers I've ever had (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A?select=7I90Agn0u79pvZ34qr7lbg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fW7S...</a>). **Recommendations**        - I've yet to taste their entree meals, but from what I've had already, this place is definitely worth trying.",

Not going to lie this was a little hard to find due to the gps being weird and google maps placing it where it wasn't but once found it certainly is a treasure.  You want to go ahead and take buffalo instead of rainbow due to construction.  Once this place is settled I have no doubt that I'm going to have to wait in line for this place.  Once I found the place and stepped inside the decorations were very very nice.  What I would expect from a country cafe.  A very quiet place.  I came with a friend and we were the only ones in the place, which is definitely a nice change from the bustle that I am used to.    Once seated the menu was right there waiting for us.  Good layout of the menu and pretty decent sized lettering which made it very clear what you were reading.  The menu was also decorated like in the westerns with letters misspelled or even missing but you can obviously tell that it was done on purpose.  I had read on here that this place had bomb country fried steak so I of course had to try it out.  It was surprisingly good.  Not what I had expected at all.  Even writing this now my mouth is watering because I remembered how delicious it was.  The steak was a hearty slab that was in fact very tender.  The gravy was so smooth yet thick and flavorful just like what you would expect from that specific gravy.  Indeed one of the best I have had.  Compliments to the chef.  The portion was pretty big as well.  My friend got the hungry farmer and the bacon strips were huge.  The biggest I have seen and was very impressed.  The owner was definitely a nice guy.  He even admits he's a little sarcastic but definitely a good guy.  If you can't take a little poking then maybe you might want to come back when the roads are finished and has more staff on hand.  This is a place that I see myself being a regular at.  Note:  You seat yourself.  There are signs that say sit wherever you want.",

Everything is made from scratch and has a very nice taste to it. We tried the sliders, fried chicken and soup and everything was tasty and filling! Oh, and if you visit do NOT leave without trying their peach cobbler...it is awesome.  * Service (the reason I did not give it 5 stars): AWFUL!!!!!!!! The guy who was waiting tables clearly did not want to be there. This person did not offer a smile, was pretty short with every question we asked. He seemed bothered by me asking for extra condiments and rarely checked in with us. THIS IS A GREAT RESTAURANT BUT YOU NEED FRIENDLY STAFF!!!!!!  * Overall experience: Pretty good. I wil definitely visit again and try other menu items. One thing though, and I cannot stress this enough...I HOPE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT SERVER WHEN I GO THERE AGAIN.  Conclusion: Definitely try this place!",

I expected that it was going to be busy and that there was going to be a long wait (I totally didn't mind the wait; that's why I was the first in my group to show up), but I wasn't expecting to be treated like I wasn't a person. I first walked in and no one was there to greet the line of waiting guests or myself. There was just a sign that said \"please wait to be seated\" so I waited about 10mins. I was so confused on what was going on. I was hoping that the forth staff member that made eye contact with me and walked by me would at least acknowledge my presence and nothing. I was suppose to meet my other party members here, but after the treatment I got from this establishment I immediately called my group and told them to meet somewhere else. Our business was obviously not needed here. It was my first and last time ever going.",

Falling off the bone tender. Clam chowder was fair. Potato salad fresh made but fair also. Service was good. Owner came by several times to check on us. I loved the fact they were a little flexible allowing us to get the potato salad instead of the mashed potatoes. Afterward I kinda of regretted not getting the mashed potatoes with gravy. Not their fault, mine. Wife said the gravy looked good and they ran out of the mashed potatoes so probably they were the thing to get. Next time. I really loved they had so many deserts to choose from like German choc cake , chocolate cake, bread pudding, peach cobbler and more. You could pick a sampler of three if you wanted for $7.99. Was disappointed I was too full from the meal to get dessert. These guys get how important it is to your business to promote yelp and using  emails to place orders online. Well run business. Friendly staff. Could do a better job of recognizing which customers come in first. Overall very nice tho",
