Seriously are you guys doing roll ups in the dark or do you just not care that when I unroll my utensils that I see other peoples left over food all over my fork and knife and you think it's ok to give that to me? I wonder how clean everything else is if repeatedly this issue happens and no one cares to resolve it. Disappointing and disgusting.",

I was complaining that the prices have risen but the portions were smaller. A disappointing experience after being such a good patron for so many years.    Richard",

I am giving them two stars just for the taste of the food. The other three stars are being subtracted for the service this location gives. Today's experience consisted of me walking in to order one slice of cake to go. It was the truffle cake. Usually the thing is pretty big. But not today, it was half the size it usually is. When I asked the worker her response was I was wrong that it's smaller than usual. She told me I Must of got the last slice the other 25 times I've bought the same cake.  She had terrible customer service. I waited for a few minutes then asked for a manager. When I told the manager it was smaller she said it did look smaller and she would get another slice. She came back and told me they measured it and it was the right size but they would give me a different slice. They came back with it and it was bigger than the first one but the same as the others I've gotten over the years.   It may sound so petty to complain about a slice of cake being half the size of what they usually serve but when I get told I am wrong about what I have received before, it rubs me the wrong way.",

I am on a diet and I was excited to discover the SkinnyLicious Menu.  The lettuce mexican chicken tacos are only 250 calories.  How often do you find such good diet options at a restaurant?    My friend was already seated when I arrived.  It took between 5 and 8 minutes for the waitress to show up and ask me for my drink order.  Since I had been sitting there for so long, we were both ready to order when she arrived.  Then came the wait for the food.  Again, I had the lettuce tacos and she had a chicken sandwich with fries.  We sat there for 20 minutes waiting for our food.    We enjoyed the food, but again came the wait for the waitress to return so we could ask for the check.  Then the wait for her to come back and pick the check.  At this point, I had to bail and go back to work.  I gave my friend cash.  I also advised her to just pay and go to the front to get her piece of cheesecake she wanted to take home.  (She told the waitress at the time of ordering that she wanted to take a piece of cheesecake home.  Apparently, the waitress didn't want the tip on the cheesecake.)  Food 5, service 2-3",

For my 29th, they took me to Cheesecake Factory at Boca Park.  Also, I was here to celebrate my 30th birthday with my parents, and I hung out with one of my friend's here.  No, I'm not a Cheesecake Factory Lover, for some reason I would end up here from time to time.  You don't need a reservation, however at times you'll find your self waiting if you don't have a reservation.  Most of the time it's on a Friday and Saturday that's it's busy.  But what restaurant isn't busy on those two days?  What I like about this spot is the fact it's a huge facility.  When I entered through the huge double doors that seem to reach the ceiling, I found how clean it was.  There was not a trash on site.  The restaurant was super clean and well kept.  I was very impressed by that.  Upon seating, I notice that servers aren't really great.  They always seem to be in a hurry and don't take the time.  I always felt like I was being hurried.  If I took my time, they take forever to get back to me before I can order.  This always happened here.  Let's start with appetizers.  I liked their Fire Roasted Artichokes.  I thought that was a good choice.  It took a long time to get through it but you don't feel so full after eating it.  Their Fried Calamari was just mediocre.  It had too much flour on it and it wasn't as plumpy or juicy as Philippino's make it.  My dad makes them better.  Another you can't go wrong with is the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip.  It's a good starter and isn't too salty.  As for the negatives, don't order their Lettuce Wraps.  It's just not good enough, even to compare to P.F. Chang's.     The only entree I can remember that I liked was the Meat Loaf.  It tasted very good and was very filling.  The serving portions are so great that you can even take it home with you and eat the rest for lunch the next day.  I only go here if I don't feel like thinking about what to eat and where to go.  Maybe that's why I always end up here.",

It was big enough to feed about 4 people! Also ordered the slice of red velvet cheese cake which was excellent and was sized perfect for 2 people to share. Will definitely be coming back to this location!",

I was seriously so excited because I had been on a Cheesecake Factory kick the last 2 months and was happy my family was coming. It was a Sunday and it really wasn't that busy around 3:00. The server we had took 20 minutes to even come to the table after we were seated. Then only offered water and bread and walked away before I could even get the other drink orders in, and seemed irritated after we had asked for more than water. Both bathrooms were absolutely disgusting, there was vomit all over both, and it had clearly been there for a little while. My mother ordered the fish tacos, and apparently was the only one who made a safe choice. The 3 of us however, all ordered a meal with chicken and all 3 of us got food poisoning. I don't know what happened on Sunday, but I am seriously so disappointed in that entire meal. Normally this place is 5 stars, but this is absolutely unacceptable.",

I'd have to say, that the calamari is by far my favorite thing o order. I just love the white sauce that comes with it. The breading on the calamari is always so nice and light, and always crispy.   Secondly, I would highly suggest the Chicken Madeira. Plus, it's such a huge portion, theres usually some left overs !!",

I had the Luau Salad, and the waiter recommended I get the full size, as opposed to the lunch size, if I was hungry.

She came back and admitted that she had \"totally spaced\" putting my order in and it would be right out. So then the manager visited our table and gave us the obligatory \"sorry\" but didn't offer any adjustments to our bill...not even a free dessert or drink. After finishing my lunch, I asked for a couple boxes so I could take the leftovers home and was shocked at what happened next. Our waitress actually walked up with 2 boxes, handed me one and said \"oh gosh, I was supposed to bring you 2...but this one is for someone else so I will be right back.\" Needless to say, I was utterly shocked. We left full of good food but the bad taste in both of our mouths is impossible to overlook. Sorry Cheesecake Factory...We won't be coming back to this location again.",

The server seemed nice, but after receiving our food....someone messed that up too. She ordered white rice with the gumbo but got the regular brown rice. My girlfriend accepted the food anyway, but again....she was not happy.   Overall, it was a bad experience. We still like the Cheesecake Factory, but I would probably recommend another one in town.

I picked out a cheesecake and the hostess said that they would decorate the plate and send it out with a candle at the end of our meal. She said she would pass the message along to the server. I saw her write everything down.  The server was friendly and greeted us in a timely manner. He went over the soup of the day as well as daily specials. We ordered the Eggroll sampler, all the egg rolls were greasy and dripping with oil. The chicken madeira was excellent as usual. And the herb crusted salmon was okay.   When we were full, the server was kind enough to pack our food for us, but he failed to crumb the table and left our dirty silverware and small plates in the middle of the table. I even moved everything to the middle of the table so it would be easy for him to pick up because I knew he would be bringing our cheesecake out and I wanted to take photos. At the end of lunch, the server handed us dessert menus, I gave him the eye. He said 'I got it'... and brought a cheap birthday sundae with pure whip cream. He put it right in the middle of all the dirty dishes. That really ruined it for me. The Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE RESTAURANT.. or should I say WAS. To be honest, the service 15 years ago was significantly better than the service I've received within these past few years.. especially at the Summerlin location. How can you drop dessert on a table with dirty plates and food crumbs everywhere?? I'd like to add that it was not even busy. And where was the cheesecake I preordered that the hostess said they were going to decorate for our special occasion?  I have over 20 years of restaurant/hospitality experience, so yes! I am a restaurant/service snob! So maybe my service expectations are too high.. but I wouldn't expect anything else from the Cheesecake Factory. I am truly disappointed in my recent experiences with your establishment. A few years ago a  server refilled my water with another water cup saying she couldn't find any water pitchers anywhere... only at the Summerlin location I get this kind of service!",

I then spoke to a different manager, however all they seemed to do is apologize for the poor quality food but did nothing or made any attempt to offer any remedy or solution for the poorly prepared food.   So I drove the food back to the restaurant the manager Jason refused to replace it or offer any sort of resolution. They keep apologizing but couldn't offer any solution. I left the take out food on the counter and left. Zero effort or capacity to wear the title as management at the cheese cake factory.   ~~~ Mind Blowing how poor the customer service or lack of responsibility this location has.  I would never give my business to these people what so ever.   Stay away from this location.",

First came out to sweet and seemed like the bartender doesn't even know how to make a classic mojito. Came back and all he did was put sour mix in it and called it...I'm like are you f***ing kidding me. When I told the server that it's like all he did is put sour mix he didn't even muddle the lime and mint leaves with simple syrup and roll the rest of the ice and liquor with soda water...I give a big fat F in Fail! It's so simple, bartender must be new to bartending. The server didn't even apologize. I actually told him to taste it and tell me if that taste like a mojito. So I just ordered a beer...the server didn't even bring us waters when we asked. My wife had to get up find another server to get us water. The food was good I can't lie about that...then a fly flew into my wife's drink and we both lost our appetite, looked up and just saw a bunch of flies on the glass that separates the kitchen and dinning room. We pack out food and paid the bill and left...so unhappy and disappointed.

Also, they were not packed, no waiting and they crammed us in a small two person table right next to another table full of people. I feel like they could have spread us out a bit... But overall very pleased and will definitely return next time I am in town.",

I inquired if they can slice a whole cheesecake into more segments than how they regularly do it & I was informed that they can't because the cheesecake comes already sliced. Weird! Then I was told that they can't cut the cheesecake when it's frozen. So I paid for a to go whole cheesecake & was asked to wait. When the cheesecake was handed to me, I was told that they're out of bags except smaller ones.  Before leaving the counter, I asked for what's the best way of cutting the cheesecake without having it sticking on the knife. I was instructed to put the knife in hot water before slicing. Now here's the worst part of it...I was told by a female employee (I think she was in-charged of the cheesecake counter at that time) that if I ordered the cheesecake in advance that they can slice it in several segments than they regularly do because it's been thawed already. So, I said that I can pickup my cheesecake after 2 hours after it thawed & I'll have them cut it for me in several segments. The response I got was \"No, we can't do it because you've already paid for it.\"  I need someone from a Customer Service to contact me ASAP!!!",

We do not want to judge the first time therefore we asked the server for the bread again, but she only replied \"they are in the oven\". Our table can see exactly the kitchen area, therefore we know once the bread is done. The main reason it cause us mad in her service, is that even the bread is cooked and are ready to serve, she is with her guests chatting. She have little awareness of her wait and her attitude while taking order is not polite also. Therefore we want to rate her here and let others realized her performance.",

Everything took forever, our orders were messed up, our drinks were consistently empty, and it just took forever. The hosts weren't friendly, our server was overwhelmed - it just makes for a really unpleasant experience, especially when you're trying to celebrate a birthday. To further my complaints about their service - I wrote a message to their \"contact us\" portion of their website and detailed our experience over a week ago, and never heard back. Unacceptable service.",

I go pick up my order, drive all the way back home bc i am not down the street, to find not only did they put no pickles but also didn't put mustard.

In Vegas, I've been to this Summerlin location at least 20 times and usually my chances of quality customer service are 50/50 (between the hosts and servers) so I would normally give the place only 3 stars BUT tonight I experienced the best customer service I've ever had at this location, mostly due to our server Daniel O.  The restaurant was busy and he had multiple tables but he was very attentive to each of them including us. Constantly walking by to check on any needs we may have, picking up extra bread plates etc that we were done with, quickly, providing drink refills before we could even request them etc.  Honestly, he is the only server I've ever had at this location that didn't disappear at some point.  Also, he was very friendly and provided helpful suggestions to all of his customers re food options, adding sauce to a dish etc. Overall, the food was solid as usual, but Daniel O. was the one who really made our dining experience. I hope next time we go there, he is working so we can request him.",

When I got to my booth it looked nice at a glance but then I found left over lettuce and crumbs on my table not a big deal either except my clean silverware was left for me on this table uncovered. Anyways I've been here before so it's not a big deal to me anyways. Our server was this character named Sean. And he was extremely entertaining and did his job well. We were rly here for dessert so what we did was ordered 3 appetizers and then two wonderful cheesecakes. Yum love both of them. Anyways I'll be back hopefully when it's not too busy",

What frustrated me and really killed the moment for us both was that we ordered some nice coffees to go along with our cheesecake, and they were served in regular pint cups.  Wtf is that about? I've never felt so snobby in my life, but you will see, every where you go you will get coffee in a mug, and now I know from this experience that the cup makes such a difference.  You either burned your mouth drinking from the straw, or drink only foam drinking from the cup. A pint glass JUST DOESN'T WORK.",

    "text": "We were staying in Las Vegas strip but went out to Red Rock Canyon for the day and used YELP to find this location away from the busy strip before heading back to our hotel.  We were at this restaurant on 11-23-2015 at about 5:30pm.  We had decent service with one issue that was poorly addressed by our server. My little one ordered grilled chicken from the kids menu . It came with grilled chicken mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.  I reached over to try one of his carrots and it tasted funny to me. I thought it was my imagination but I noticed he left them all on his plate at the end of our meal. He said they  were not good.  I reached over and tasted one again and indeed they were rancid. I smelled the pile on his plate and yes they were rancid indeed.  I am not one to complain about things and my main concern was that the restaurant would serve them to other patrons. My wife let the waitress know in a non defensive manner about the carrots and she rudely  offered to replace them with another vegetable but we were not asking for carrot replacement, we were all done with our meals.  She was very nonchalant about issue and mumbled she would take them to the chef????? Then came back and dropped off our bill and never apologized or let her superiors know or chef or whoever she reports to. Never said a word and that was it. Picked up credit card and dropped it off hastily after she charged it.  We noticed they outline tip suggestion, our bill was 92 dollars and suggested tip was 16 dollars. My wife and I decided to leave without tipping. We have never in 15 years being married not left a tip. I worked for auto customer service for a long time and I appreciate tips and good service.  The decent thing to do would be to apologize and say that she has let the chef or her manager know and kindly apologized and removed charge.  The non tipping was far more than 6.50, kids meal price, the restaurant would have been out of.  Poor customer service.",

They forgot to bring the dressing. Had to keep asking for the dressing, the chicken, bread...We asked one person and another would bring the item. Five different people came to our table, none knowing what the other one had been told by us. Very frustrating. The mandarin oranges were well hidden since there were only two in a salad. The to go salad had no wontons, no rice noodles, and only one small dressing when I asked for two. There was no bread- had to ask twice for it. It seems that a restaurant that has been around for some time should know about customer service and how to make one of their most popular salads. No manager ever came to apologize in spite of my telling one of the five people who came to our table during their game of \"telephone\" that they need to stop sending different people who don't know what we told the previous one. Have had similar experiences with to go orders- never seem to get it right and don't seem to care. Very disappointed.",

I stood in front of the hostess station for roughly 5 minutes without being acknowledged by the hostess, although there were numerous times where eye contact was made, there was no attempt to greet, acknowledge etc... At the point were she began to have a casual conversation with another hostess, I asked if she intended on seating my wife and I. She stated in a very short manner \"well I thought you might have been with another party that had already checked in\". A simple greeting and may I help you could have cleared any uncertainty.. My wife and I were then seated immediately by another hostess who apologized. I asked to speak with a manager and someone who appeared to be a waiter approached the table and stated that he was the manager and would address the poor customer service my wife and I experienced on what was our wedding anniversary lunch. He didn't seem to take my complaint very seriously and to top it off, once we received our food, it was extremely salty. I didn't feel another complaint would go anywhere so I kindly paid by bill, tipped the waitress Alisha and left.. I will never return.",

    "text": "A couple years ago, this place was good. I always loved coming here for the ambiance, and the food was always pretty awesome. Within the past year, though, I've had complaints, but still gave them chances to redeem themselves. But now, I don't think I'll be back for a while.   During one visit, we had a group of six people. I don't know what was going on with our waiter, but he came to check on us maybe once after we got our food, and none of our drinks were ever filled. When it came time to drop off the bill, we were informed that gratuity was already added to the bill. In my experience, places only do this if your party is eight or larger. The only reason this pissed us off was because it then clicked in our heads, \"Oh, so that's why he didn't give a fuck about serving us. He's getting a fat tip anyway.\" And it's not like he was nowhere to be found. We saw him several times, checking on people around us, but could never get his attention. I only wish I could remember his name.  But what iced the cake was our last visit. My boyfriend ordered a burger, medium rare. When it came out, it looked good until he took a bite of it. The entire inside was raw. It was so disgusting, I couldn't even believe it. Our waitress seemed to agree, and she took it back for them to make a new one. Then a manager came and sort of apologized, asked if we wanted anything else. We're all modest and junk so we said, \"No, we're fine,\" but of course we were expecting they at least wouldn't charge us for the burger or, ya know, give us a coupon or something. Nothing. Guess they don't seem to care if the customer gets food poisoning because of their careless chefs. Not trying to sound like a freeloader, I just think it was a horrible business call. Anyways, it was enough for me to want to stay away for a while.",

    "text": "I went here last week with my son for lunch. My suggestion no less. I just remember that years ago it was very good. Not so much this time.  We were seated in the bar area which was fine it is just that the table was very small. Barely held the drinks and the plates. We had two of the small appetizers, the corn fritters and the fried artichoke hearts. They were both very good. This is why I have to at least apply the second star. Now I can only speak for my lunch but it was inedible. I ordered the lunch Chicken Picatta. I knew as soon as it was set in front of me something was not right. The chicken was a shade of white like I have never seen before. I took a bite anyway, It was retched, I spit it right out. I thought maybe it was me, tried a second bite. Again same terrible spoiled taste. The only person I saw who worked there was the bus boy, I told him the chicken was bad. He promptly took my plate. He came back after a few minutes to tell me the manager would be over and they were cooking another one for me. I told him no thanks, just the thought of chicken was making me sick. The manager came over to ask me what was wrong. I explained, she was behaving as though she did not believe me. Starts telling me that they get fresh food every other day. I am not saying they don't, but the damn chicken was bad. She states maybe it is the capers, NO i have had capers a million times, I did not even put a caper in my mouth. I told her that I was being very discreet regarding this and did not cause a scene. She asked if I would prefer something else, I ordered a plain burger. When the burger arrived it was fine.  What bothers me the most is that they were acting like I was making this up. Second my son and I ate in shifts. I do not see my son enough to want to have our lunch together ruined and eaten in shifts.  When I got the check, my son asked if they removed the chicken charge, they did, he asked if they charged for the burger, they did. He was pretty pissed about this stating i should not have been charged for the burger.  At this point I was over the Cheesecake Factory, and will never be heading back.",

The atmosphere and layout are similar to other Cheesecake Factories, and of course, the menu is the same. Let me pause for a moment and talk about the menu- it's big, with what seems like an endless array of menu items spanning across the globe in terms of cuisines. What's nice about the extensive menu is you can try something new every time you visit (that is, if you don't go everyday), but what's not so nice about the menu is the time it takes to make a decision about what to eat.   Anyways, after being seated, complimentary bread was brought to our table. We had two choices of bread- a soft brown bread with oats on top (Could it be Pumpernickel or Honey Oat?) and a sourdough baguette.  After perusing the menu, I decided to order the Soup of the Day, which was a Lentil Soup with an infusion of bacon essence. Even though there were hardly any customers, it took a long time before our food came out, leaving me no choice but to eat a lot of the bread. By the time my soup came out, I was already full, but I managed to finish most of the soup. The soup itself was very hearty and chunky with lots of lentils, reminiscent of porridge. The flavors were good, but the bacon flavor that the server emphasized was not vey noticeable. Overall, I enjoyed my visit. Portions are large, prices are reasonable, the cheesecakes are good, and there's something for everybody, which I think are the main reasons for why Cheesecake Factory is so popular.",

    "text": "Started off rough. The host stand didn't really know what it was doing (I think it was turnover which might've been why), so we waited a long time to be seated and they didn't seat anyone who came in for about 15 minutes. Normally, I wouldn't mind but my grandma has a hard time standing for a long time and since no one was being seated, none of the seats in the waiting area opened up. Regardless, our waitress Sandy really turned it around. It was my little sister's birthday, Sandy made it a point to remember our names, sing to my little sister with a dessert specifically for her (wrote her name on it), took amazing care of us even with our difficult orders and questions about the menu (my father is vegan), and never complained even though we were a very needy table. She truly wanted to serve us and it's extremely refreshing. I worked as a waitress/bartender for six years and I can honestly say Sandy is the best waitress I've ever had. If you go to this Cheesecake Factory, ask to sit in Sandy's section! Oh and the avocado rolls were DELICIOUS!!!",

Instead,  the waitress disappeared after dropping off the food, took forever to get toppings for my burger and when we complained about the COLD CHICKEN TACOS, she said that's the way they come. REALLY?  Broke my heart to see my dad frown and then say he didn't like it.  I took a bite to discover the chicken had a hint of warmth.   By the time the waitress reappeared I was almost done, my parents were picking at the tacos and she reluctantly offered to remake the tacos.  At that point our time with my dad's patience ran out do to his Alzheimer's.   What a sad memory.   Shame on you guys, shame.",

The manager was very helpful, and said he would honor them, and gave me his card to make sure I could use them if he wasn't around. It's a shame that I didn't write down his name.   I decided to eat there yesterday, with a friend, but it was more crowded than I expected for a Wednesday. I was told it was about a 25 minute wait, but it was really only about 15 minutes. The hosts and staff were very friendly, even though there was a crowd of customers waiting around. We were seated in a booth close to the kitchen, and if I have to think of any negative, it's that those booths were very dark, so it was hard to read the menu. That isn't enough to remove a star, though. Our server, Shawn was just awesome! He was the perfect combination of friendly and professional. I would recommend you sit at his table! I ordered the Chicken Madeira/Steak Diane combo, which was very good, and exceeded my expectations by a mile. My plate was so clean, you would have thought I licked it that way. I had the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake for dessert which was also very good. I would expect nothing less from a restaurant with cheesecake in their name. I only have a picture of my dessert, since I forgot to take one of my actual meal.   I'm sure I will be back, even without gift certificates...haha.",

Their cheesecakes are to die for, but the calorie count is beyond belief and just might kill you (as is the case for most items on their menu).  I love the brown bread they bring to the table when you arrive and their passion fruit iced tea is the bomb! Of course, the avocado eggrolls are exquisite, but I seldom order them. Instead, I found a recipe that tastes exactly the same so make it at home. Making the recipe, though, shows why their food is so good--they use unique and quality ingredients and their dressings and sauces include many, many ingredients (many of which are hard to find).  I usually order a dinner salad, eat half of it, and take the rest home (asking for a little extra dressing in my take-home bag). With the remainder, I can make two more meals simply by adding extra lettuce.   The Cheesecake Factory is not cheap so is truly a special treat. They offer take-out so are a great option when traveling and don't feel like going out to eat or ordering room service.",

The had a veggie burger and a vegan burger and lots of salads, it was the perfect menu! Being plant-based, it was really nice to have so many options for myself. My salad was big enough for two people. A few people ordered cheesecake slices to go. It was our friends birthday and the6 brought her a little treat and sang her a song.

There was a 20 minute wait on the night we went which was to be expected for a weekend. No big deal as we browsed the variety of cheesecakes available near the entrance.  After being seated, the service just seemed slow even on a busy night. It took a while for the bread to come out. It took a while for the food to come out. When the food finally did come out, the portions were huge and the food was good. We did have a minor issue with how the pasta was cooked. It was not cooked wrong per se, but we prefer it to be cooked a little longer. Our waitress offered to correct the dish so no big deal.  Overall, the experience was ok. It's what I have come to expect from The Cheesecake Factory. Food is usually pretty spot on with big portions. Service is hit or miss.",

    "text": "Just a horrendous experience all around.  I will never go back to a Cheesecake property ever again.  My husband called twice a few days before to ask for a reservation (we had a party of 13).  They said they don't take reservations not even for larger parties or if you leave a credit card.  He called the day of (9/14) to see if they could do anything as well as a couple hours before.  They just said \"we can accommodate\".  We got there a little earlier than we said we would (we told them 7 but we arrived around 6:45) and would take whatever we could get inside/outside, first avail.  The manager told us it would be an hour to an hour and 15.  We waited OVER an hour and 45min. (Almost 2 hours) and still didn't have anything, we finally gave up and went to Grimaldi's which was a FAR BETTER experience.  There were tables of 8 and 9 people getting seated over us regularly and those aren't small parties.  Finally the manager tells us she can seat us but separated which would have been fine as long as we were near each other however we still didn't have a guaranteed table(s) anywhere.  Apparently she was waiting for one party to leave so she could seat us, made absolutely no sense!!!  I mean could they not move tables together, it's a huge venue why wait on ONE party.  They were there over 3ish hours and I understand she didn't want them to leave, we didn't want her to kick them out but this restaurant seats a lot of people, how could you not coordinate at least two tables of 6 or whatever the arrangement could be.  We also had a toddler with us who we had to order food (and eat in the busy lobby on her mom's lap) because she was starving and understandably acting out.  The manager was nice enough to Comp that.  We ordered multiple drinks at the bar throughout the evening and finally left after 2 hours (2hours!!). Beware if you have a big group.  The only reason why we went there in the first place was because my husband and I had 2 gift cards we wanted to get rid of.  We will be giving them away because we refuse to use them, so awful!",

Avocado egg rolls are always a pleasant choice for a appetizer. Lemon Drop Martinis accommodates the romance in the air. I highly recommend The Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park if you're looking for a low key but slightly romantic and relaxing evening. Definitely always a win.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with this location. It used to be my favorite but after using a gift card there it has completely turned me off. It is not the closest location to me but I enjoy this area so I placed an order online for pickup. I used a gift card that I had and everything seemed to be fine.  The wait was pretty long but since it was around 6 pm on a Friday that was to be expected. When I finally got to the counter they repeated my order to me correctly. I know I should have checked but when they repeated it to me exactly as I ordered I assumed it was correct. When I got home I found that my entire order was wrong. I figured I would just pick around what I didn't like. However, the entire thing was inedible. I decided to call back to see if I could get a discount at least. When I spoke to a manger he was very friendly and insisted that he would refund the entire meal. I told him that was unnecessary because I wasn't going to go back. I was just hoping for a discount. He said that no he would refund the whole thing if I would email pictures. I did. And then never heard back from him again. I emailed 2 more times and instead of honoring the manager's word I was asked to call another manager and talk about this situation. I will never recommend this location to anyone and would never believe what any of the managers say.",

I was so surprised, but we waited patiently for our table and it wasn't too bad of a wait, about 10 minutes.   We were seated and service was friendly and attentive considering how busy the restaurant was. Refills were plentiful and food was ok. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp and although I was a little disappointed with my food choice, everyone else seemed to enjoy their food and portions were more than sufficient. There was so much food, we had plenty of leftovers to take home with us.   I always remember the limoncello cake from previous visits, so we ordered that to share as well. Not as great as I remembered, but still solid and everyone was happy with the meal. Great service and pretty ok food for a chain restaurant. I'd definitely come back with a gift card or for happy hour in the future.",

Today something was noticeably different. It seems Cheesecake Factory has caved to cheapness and convenience and switched to compressed air whipped cream. After all, isn't the real, heavy, whipped cream all part of the decadence of purchasing a $7.95 piece of cheesecake?! I am giving the cheesecake dessert and restaurant three stars because I want you to know the importance of REAL WHIPPED CREAM! After all, isn't the dessert the main reason people come here? This is the Rampart location in Summerlin, Las Vegas, Nevada.  My husband and I are so disappointed, that, unless, this \"mistake\" is corrected we will no longer frequent Cheesecake Factory.",

So, I ordered a garlicky pasta dish.  It was tasty, but unfortunately I felt sick all night.  I know it wasn't the appetizer because the friend I dined with had no problems whatsoever.  Perhaps if I'd gotten the meal I wanted, I wouldn't have been sleepless until 5:30 am because I felt like I was going to throw up.  I've never had a bad experience at TCF before, so I'm going to view this as a fluke happenstance.  All the same, I don't intend to dine at this particular locale again.",

It's like a \"fancy\" Applebee's or Chili's, except it doesn't have junk cluttering the walls and the menu options sound appetizing.   I dined here on a Thursday evening around dinner time. Unsurprisingly, there were plenty of people ahead of us waiting to be seated, because Cheesecake Factory is just too cool to take reservations -- first come, first serve, peasants.   Once seated, we ordered the avocado egg rolls as a starter. Always a solid appetizer; though the sweet tamarind sauce might be an acquired taste for some. For my entree I ordered the grilled chicken tostada salad. When it arrived, I noticed it was missing the side of vinaigrette dressing, as well as the avocado cream and sour cream. It was unfortunate that our waitress had to make two visits to retrieve the missing items. The salad was quite huge and could easily be shared between two people. Can't say this was one of the best salads that I've ordered from here. To top off dinner, I got the kahlua cocoa chocolate cheesecake, which hit the spot and made up for the salad mishap.   Off-peak hours are always the best time to visit, if you don't mind waiting. And if you do mind, fortunately there many quality restaurants in the area that you could go to instead.",

    "text": "The Cheesecake Factory has always been a staple in my wife and I's dining out habits. However, the last time we went to dinner we had a really disappointing experience. We brought her family that were in town from Germany so that they could finally experience this Cheesecake Factory place we tell them about somewhat frequently.  To start, our waiter was the definition of a tool. I hate to be mean, but his name might as well have been Tony tough nuts. He tried to be nice, but the vibe from him just was not good. What's worse is he forgot drinks for 15 minutes at a time, and would remember when I asked about them. He took FOREVER to take our initial order, despite me asking and him walking past quite a few times. Just in general, bad vibe.  Then comes the food. Service is forgivable when the food is amazing. This time, it was not. We decided to get the Guacamole since we recently had some at El Dorado and we were craving some again. They brought it to the table, and we quickly realized that it was HUGE chunks of Avocado, and not ripe avocado at that. It was hard and stringy. So I asked the waiter to send it back since, ya know, we couldn't even dip chips in it because it was like half an avocado at a time.  He brings it back, and says...yeah just so you know that's how we do the guacamole now, so if you want it more mashed up you have to specify. REALLY?! It's a DIP, not pieces of apple you're eating. The thing is, with this guy, he could have been making it up since he was that type of person. he also tried to blame the bar on the drinks, then clearly went and put it in the computer since he forgot (we could see the bar and the computer right next to us).  Anyway, my four cheese pasta came out luke warm and cold on the outsides, but by this point I said screw it, I ate some of it and too the rest home to heat up the next day.   Overall it was a bad experience, and I doubt we'll be back anytime soon. Gordon Biersch is always consistent for us, as is Brio, so we'll probably just go there.",

I was surprised that there was a wait time of about 15 minutes. We were seated with our party of 3 at that time.   The bread was delicious and the waitress seemed nice. I got what I always got the chicken fettuccine Alfredo , my 5 year old got the corn dogs and my cousin has ordered the Philly cheesesteak. Everything was going good until waiting for the food. It was literally a good 36 minute wait time for the food and we didn't see the waitress at all during this time. The waiter at the table next to us told his frustrated customers that the kitchen was backed up.   We eventually got our food. It was delicious but I never got my Parmesan cheese. This is one of my favorite parts, it had crossed my mind the maybe they did not do this anymore but the person at the table next to us had been asked and received some. We didn't see our waitress again for a very long time. It was very frustrating because of the time it had taken to receive our food my 5 year old was already restless and I was already ready to order dessert and get the check but took forever for her to arrive.  We had even asked eachother if it would even be worth it to order enough thing because of how much time it was taking for the simple things like asking for a refill or anything it was another 15 minutes   The cheesecake I always receive... The original was drenched with sour cream topping ... It was gross. Normally they have just enough to taste with the whip cream but this thing was covered in it. We took a few bites and left it .   I'm so disappointed because as I did this is my favorite place. One of the best things being the service and food and both things were a disappointment this time .",

We waited around 45min-1 hour when there were more than plenty tables available. There were people who came in after us and were seated before and we were all parties of two. The food was also very average as well. We ordered the Pasta da Vinci and it was over cooked and a bit bland. Not our usual experience at a Cheesecake Factory.",

See my posted photo of receipt from my last visit to Cheesecake Factory, Boca Park location.  Though it's only a suggested gratuity, they Deceitfully suggest you tip on the taxed amount.  Almost every other restaurants I visit only suggest tip on actual food & beverages as it's supposed to be.  I usually tip 22 - 25% of amount & sometimes glance at these numbers to help determine my tipping amount.  I noticed this before but now have to speak out because of continued use of this misleading practice.  If this happens to you Yelpers at other Cheesecake locations, please post a review to warn others of the Dishonest Billing practice being used by Cheesecake Factory!  5 Stars for Food 4.5 Stars for Service \"0\" Stars for Billing Practice",

    "text": "I am no stranger to this place, and this is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location to come to in Las Vegas. The service is always exceptional and my most recent visit was even better. I went with my family to celebrate a special occasion and our waiter Sidney was great! He was very personable and prompt with checking up on us to ensure our food was great.   Beverages: My mother and sister each ordered Red Sangrias and I decided to go with the Pineapple Mojito. Delicious!   Appetizer: We usually never get appetizers but this time we decided to switch things up and tried the Crispy Crab Bites, and they were to die for! The dish only comes with three crab bites which may not seem like enough but they were decent in size, and just enough to hold you over until the main course.   Entrees: As a spicy food fan, I almost always go for the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it never fails! My sister got the Chicken & Biscuits and my mother enjoyed the Southern Fried Catfish. Her catfish was so tender that it fell apart as soon as you cut into it (major key!) and the dressing on the side was yummy too.  Desserts: My mother and I decided to split the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake and let me just say I was pleasantly surprised! Rather then the dish being served as a traditional cake, the dish is actually comprised of three sugar biscuits and the vanilla ice cream & strawberries mixed in. With both of us splitting the dessert, we still had some leftover to take home.   My sister got 'Linda's Fudge Cake' and she also enjoyed it! The serving slice was huge and the cake was very rich. 10's across the board!",

Our waitress was absolutely horrible, we order the Southwest Grilled chicken sandwich to share, it was suppose to have avocado, after waiting 10 mins for her to return we asked for avocado, it took her another 6 mins to bring the avocado. After taking a bite I no longer wanted the sandwich, it was cold and hard from sitting for 15 mins. She never offered for us to speak to the manager or compensation, her excuse was I'm sorry the kitchen is still recovering from Mother's Day. I will never dine at Cheesecake Factory again",

Instead they offer issue you a credit for the wronged item and ship it to your house.  Sometimes it comes....Most times, it does not.    Is the food good?  Sure....if you can get it.

I'd like to start off by saying I found a hair in my drink. The server, Dina E. Saw me pulling it out and said \"is that yours or mine ?\" I told her it was not mine and she then said \"it was probably mine, would you like another drink?\"  Of course I would like another drink! I mean, who would want to continue drinking it with a hair in it?! She never apologized , nothing. I felt very disrespected at the fact that she asked me if I would like another drink. I don't mind paying for what I ordered , I just feel like any other server would have at least apologized for the hair if not give me the drink on the house. Just the fact that she just casually said \"it must have been mine\" and never apologized was not okay.  If I was any other customer, I could have made a scene. Then, we ordered an appetizer.  We waited about 30 minutes for it .  8 minutes after , our food came out after a 45 minute wait total. It defeated the purpose of even ordering an appetizer.  The experience with her was just terrible. Being a frequent Cheesecake Factory visitor , I don't think I will ever come to this location again. Everyone else was great but Dina E. Made our experience horrible. Never in my life have I left such a bad tip.  I feel like she didn't even deserve one to begin with. Being in the customer service field myself , I didn't argue with her , nor say anything. I just left it as is.  Being in the position that she is in, she should work on her customer service. After all, that's what a food server is about SERVING a customer not just food but an experience and honestly I am not a happy customer.",

I decided to go lighter, to save room for the ....you guessed it CHEESECAKE!! Hell YA! Sorry, but here the entree is just an appetizer for desert.   Ordered the herb crusted salmon, served with fresh mashed potatoes and a few tasteful displayed spears of asparagus. It was really great! Cooked perfectly, light tender and moist. My friend ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (OK, not so light for him, but he loved it!)  Then we split a Red Velvet cheesecake. OMG...We were in cheesy, frosted, sugary heaven!! SO GOOD! And splitting this giant piece was absolutely the right call!",

For an appetizer we ordered the chicken dumplings, which were okay but we're definitely quite dry on the inside.

And our last plate called \"bang bang chicken\" it was terrible. I dont really understand this was on the popular plate list on Yelp. Portion is huge I guess it's because it's almost $20, it's like fusion thai and American plate. Unbalanced, dry, and flavorless. Wasn't good at all. And their service was really nice  And fast. Hope they get egg rolls next time!",

    "text": "It's been a while since we have been to a Cheesecake Factory, the opportunity came up after our original plans fell thru. Here are my thoughts regarding our experience...  First, I want to point out I felt the management team and wait staff were excellent. It was a busy night, there was a mix up with one of the meals and the management team was very pro active in taking care of it. The wait staff from start to finish was very attentive and exceeded my expectations.   So why 3 stars? Well two reasons, first I ordered fish and chips and honestly, the fish had no flavor or taste to it. The fries were cold and over salted, I kind felt like this offering is a after thought and there is an opportunity to relook at how this simple dish is prepped. With that said, the party I was with did state that their steak and chicken dishes came out well, therefore thinking next time I try one of those  The second issue, the music was loud and I felt like it was hard to hold a conversation. I almost felt like they were trying to be a little trendy with their music choices. The party sitting next to us made a comment about the music level as well.   In conclusion, I want to give this place another shot as the service was truly 5 star, but would just try a different dish.",

I've delivered over 20 orders from this place and never has one been on time. Seriously get your shit together you're supposed to be a high end restaurant.

Decided to come here since we had giftcards and my BF hasn't been to one. Nice location in Summerlin Boca park shopping center, pretty much stuff your face and walk it off after or a nice light meal either way you get your money worth. We say pretty pricey but yea so we ordered- Bread was really hard.  Jambalaya was perfect the spices and all that colorful goods for mixed in perfectly.  Spaghetti was boring, noodles cooked well but the traditional sauce was not to tasty and tasted watered down. Celebration cheesecake was amazing, we were very skeptical to order this being that it looked very sweet but it wasnt that sweet at all, smooth light taste.     Caesars salad was just okay, not worth the price for sure. Calamari was good, prefer marinara sauce but they use cocktail sauce instead. Other than that our waitress was great, forgot her name but she did her job well!",

From the very beginning we had to ask him for bread... and that seemed like a battle when asking him, no refills on our drinks, forgot the kids milk, our food order came out wrong because he didn't take note of our modifications with 2 entrees, never came back to see if the food had been fixed correctly (it was NOT, but again ... didn't want to put up a battle with Michael) plus he never came back. We had to flag a few guys to \"GRAB OUR SERVER\" and when he finally came he says \"something going on\" ... ummmmm yes WE NEED THE CHECK!!!!!  Never mind the refills and nevermind the tip from us. This guy is extremely unhappy here and needs to be let go asap! When I talked to the manager after we had gotten up, she said that he's had complaints before and it wasn't the first. What a shame. The only fixing Cheesecake factory can do is to let him go. His attitude and service ruined a birthday!",

How can I review them without talking about desert. Mmmmm. Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake is our favorite. The others look great also but we focus on certain things at each restaurant.    This is our order every time and they are very consistent.   If you have never dined at a Cheesecake Factory.  Do yourself a favor.  You can spend more and get less.  Great value and good for family dining also.",

    "text": "Am a devoted fan of the miso salmon--the buttery miso sauce and the salmon grilled to perfection pleases me every time I order it.  My sister had the herb encrusted salmon with the rosemary potatoes, which she really enjoyed (although I wasn't excited about the flavor or presentation).  My bro-in-law had the house salad and the wasabi seared ahi.  He's from Hawaii, too, and enjoyed the fresh ahi after scraping off the wasabi-flavored crust.  I tried it and found it very much lacking in seasoning, it was way too thick of a dry crust, and there was no sauce so we had to doctor it up with some soy sauce.  Service is very attentive, as usual, and we had a great table with a nice view--thank goodness, or I might have lowered the amount of stars.  Kind of disappointing visit this time around and I wanted so badly to have my family rave over this place.  The mango key lime cheesecake we ordered was supposed to be the redeeming dish, but it was way too sweet and the coconut added to the impacted hard crust didn't help, and it seemed like all the flavors didn't combine well enough to make this worthwhile ordering.  I guess it's all about ordering the right, signature dishes, which we failed to do in 3 out of the 4  tries we had.",

    "text": "5 stars for their Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! 3 stars for the Service from last visit.  I only find myself coming here to the cheesecake factory for mainly three things cheesecake, the Thai Lettuce Wraps on the appetizers menu and the Miso Glazed Salmon dish. Every time I come here, I try a dish that I haven't had here before and always leave disappointed.   When you order the lettuce wraps, on the plate comes ice burg lettuce cups, three different sauces, chicken, and veggies and you build your own wrap. Its good and enjoyable to make yourself. Plus not everyone likes the same sauces and whatnot so they have the choice of what they want.   The Miso Glazed Salmon is served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a side of cooked asparagus. The perfect combination if you ask me, and if you are there at lunch time you have the option of ordering the 1/2 order since the dinner size is really big. But my recent order was the taco salad. it wasn't anything special but shredded lettuce, strips of seasoned tortilla chips tomatoes and avocado tossed in a mayo chipotle dressing and served as three heaping HILLS on your plate. Really? I paid $13 for this dish, something i could've made at home...was disappointed to say the least.  I have tried a variety of their cheesecakes and the newest to my top list is the Pineapple upside down cake. The pineapple and crust is at the bottom and the cream cheese itself has a pineapple's flavor to it. Not so sweet, but just a perfect blend so you can enjoy it rather than having to take a sip of water between every bite.   The service from a recent visit i have gone was lacking. We were there in a group of four at most, yet have been seated after bigger groups whom arrived AFTER us has been seated. When i questioned the hostess  about it, she simply stated its easier to group the couples and bigger groups first when the room becomes available what are we??? Aside from that, it almost seemed as if the other waiters are more useful and punctual than our own waiter. we had to flag down a waiter from another table because the person waiting us can't be found. This was the first time that I have experienced such bad service. BUT, the service is usually really good and waiters are on their game.  Overall, the atmosphere is nice and busy, friendly and you can enjoy your meal either outside or inside-they give you the option. The price is nothing to complain about since the servings are big enough, and the food isn't lacking in flavor. But sometimes, you wonder what is so special about that pasta dish that they can charge $15 for....",

    "text": "The first time I went here was when I was a freshman back at UNLV in '96.  I went to the one in Caesar's Palace.  Wow, was I amazed, probably because coming from Maui we didn't have too many places like this.  It was busy, bustling with lots of people, and lots of good food and drink.  It was one of the better dining experiences I remember.  This review comes from the Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park.  I took my gf's daughter there for her 6th birthday (a very important time for a little one).  It was just her and me.  This was her first time here (that she can remember) and she was just as awestruck as I was when I first saw the place.  The decor can be considered a mix of new and old, big, tall front doors, the ambience with lots of mood lighting and tall ceilings.  It almost seems like you're stepping into a 5 star restaurant.  That is until, you see dad in his khaki shorts and mom with her summer sandals.  Which is nice, because it makes the place seem less pompous and more friendly.  I really like the food here.  I love the big portions and the mix of American, Italian, and Asian food they serve.  After seating us, we received our complimentary bread basket which I usually look forward to.  They give the usual 2 types of bread, a crusty french bread, and a wonderful wheat pumpernickel type bread.  It's really good but only when it's hot and fresh, so make sure if your server gives you a cold basket you request a new fresh one.  I don't usually have any appetizers here because I like to save room for the large entree (which I never finish) and possibly some cheesecake (well...duh, it's Cheesecake Factory), but I have heard folks say that their Thai Lettuce Wraps are definitely worth trying.  Their Factory Nachos with chicken is a pretty big platter as well and is great for sharing.  I for some reason always order the same thing when I go to a place I like.  This time was no different.  I got my fav, the DOUBLE B.B.Q. BACON CHEESEBURGER.  I LOVE this thing.  It's a double-decker Angus burger with a BBQ-ranch sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon, crispy fried onions, lettuce and tomato.  You also get a side on fries.  This bad boy well over a  pound once you put it together.  I can never get the thing in my mouth so I gotta eat it in layers.  I always end up eating only half, and take the other half home for a nice midnight snack.  This burger is SOOOO good, you gotta try it.  The little one got FETTUCINI WITH CHICKEN AND SUN-DRIED TOMATOES.  Smart kid, this dish cost me around $16  (almost TWICE the price of my burger)...and here I thought she wanted to order off the kids menu.  Quick note **this place has NO kids menu** so if you bring them in they order off the big people menu too.  I thought she wanted chicken fingers...she was like, \"No, I want white sauce\".  Lucky birthday girl...white sauce it is!  The fettuccini comes in a nice size bowl, and was flavored excellently.  It has this garlic cream-parmesan sauce that was very creamy and rich and complimented the grilled chicken well.  It also has sun-dried tomatoes on it, which I like, but the little one thought they were gross so I had to put them on the side.  For a kid that weighs only 45 pounds, she nearly killed that pasta.  She ate a good 3/4 of it by herself.  You can tell she liked it because she had a ring of white cream sauce around her lips.  So funny!  You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and NOT try their cheesecake!  That's like going to gym and not working out (although I may have done that once..or twice).  They have like over 50 cheesecakes you can choose from, and they range from about $6 -$8 a slice.  A bit pricey, but worth it for some stellar cheesecake.  You're not supposed to have more than one slice at a time anyway.  We didn't get any cheesecake this trip (the little one said 'Eww' to cheesecake and settled on her complimentary birthday sundae), which makes my first sentence in this paragraph a little contradictory.  Oh well.  But I can tell you my favorites are Tres Leches cheesecake (so dreamy), and the Oreo cheesecake (full of Oreo chunks).  Great for an end to your dining.  You can also request to take a slice of cheesecake to go and your server will pack it up for you in a nice little cheesecake container to take with you.    All in all it was a nice time.  The little one enjoyed her pasta, her pint-sized birthday sundae, and the Happy Birthday singing from some of the servers.  I always enjoy going here, great food and great service.  SO GO.  HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT, GET SOME WINE, AND END WITH SOME CHEESECAKE.  ENJOY!",

    "text": "I think this place is a great choice for food for a couple of reasons: price, location, food and outdoor seating.  Located in Boca Park near Suncoast and Badlands Golf Course, it is part of shopping complex that has many draws besides the restaurant.  The average price for this excellent quality of food is around $10-$15 dollars for an entree.  The desserts (the Cheesecakes, of course) are anywhere from $6 to $8.  I ordered Chicken Madiera with Steak Diane (a combo plate) that cost $19.99.  They bring out a couple different types of bread before your meal that will hold you over for the 30-45 minute wait for food (this place is usually always busy).  The food itself, I believe, is excellent.  it may not be at every location but with a Gordon Biersch next door, they have to step up the quality.  The steak I had was complimented nicely with mashed potatoes that weren't simply mashed potatoes; the meat was covered in a tasty mushroom wine sauce while the chicken was topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese (also with a mushroom sauce).  The desserts are excellent as well...they should be considering the name of the restaurant.  We had the Vanilla Bean (my son will only eat Vanilla) and Chocolate Oreo Mudslide Cheesecakes; both were rich and tasty and something we would order again.  The service here is as to be expected for such a busy restaurant.  We sat outside where there are fans and mist machines to keep you cool.  It was much quieter and less cramped; you also have a nice view of either the condo's next to Suncoast or the valley below.  The menu is expansive, I only covered what I ate, but I would try many other dishes here (I have in the past, all have been excellent).  The restaurant looks a lot fancier and expensive than it really is.  There isn't a kids menu so plan to order a full meal for them or just share like I did...there is plenty to go around!",

You're always around when I need a pick up, you're not too fussy, and at the end of the night if I don't want to call you the next day, I don't have to and you don't mind. Food is priced pretty average, no meal should cost you more than 20 bucks if you don't get the cheesecake, but by all means, get the cheesecake, it's why you came after all.  In fact, a friend and I only go here for cheesecake, our once every six month hang out to dish over life at our respective colleges and stuff our faces with white chocolate raspberry truffle and godiva chocolate cheesecake respectively.   They also give decent breads and are in a nice plaza with other similiarly wish-I-was-in-LA-Summerlin-boutiques and a new Gordon Biersch next door when you want to start slamming them down and accepting your life as the Real Housewives of Las Vegas.

Firstly, make sure to look at your silverware before using it because on multiple occasions there was large chucks of food on them.  I recently called in a to go order and waited on hold for over 20 minutes just to place the order.  I usually call my orders in before leaving the house so by the time I arrive it will be ready.  By the time was able to place the order I was already in the parking lot.  Waited 40 mintues in the parking lot just to come in and find a line at the register where I waited another 30 minutes because they lost the order of the people in front of me and instead of having a manager deal with it while helping the other 10+ people in line they just made everyone wait.  When it was finally my turn I notice the order they originally brought out for the lady in front of me that had been sitting on the counter for 30+ minutes was mine.  My food was ice cold when I got home and when I called to complain the manager told me I could drive back and they would have another order ready in 30 minutes. After spending a hour and half previously trying to pick up food, the last thing I wanted to do spend another 40 minutes of my life dealing with their incompetence.  The managers careless attitude and simple reply that they were busy will be the reason I will never be going back.",

I wrote this review because this is the 3rd time it has happened. Regretfully there isn't another Cheesecake Factory in the area, that's why we have to go to this location. Should just drive to the Strip! It'll be quicker than dealing with this horrendous service. Could we go somewhere else for dinner? Yes, but that's not the point of this review and I'm craving Portobello Fries...  Sure, we're calling during the \"peak\" hours, but isn't that all restaurants on weekends? No other restaurant in Summerlin has this problem in our experience. Since this is happening EVERY weekend, isn't that an indicator that perhaps they need more staffing? Every time I call, they always say: \"Let me get the manager to help take orders.\"  Duh! Shouldn't they already be involved?   Finally got Cesar on the phone (total of 21 minutes and some wait). The 2nd star was for his great attitude and exemplary service (thanks Cesar).  Extremely apologetic although not his fault.  He's the only reason I proceeded with the order and was comped a cheesecake. If they keep it up, there's only so much cheesecake to give away before they run out with their subpar service.   I'll be forwarding this to corporate.",

Staff was rude, also, when I first walked inside, it wasn't very busy, however it took about 5 mins for someone to come to the hostess booth to seat us. Bathrooms were filthy. There was poo and period stains on the toilet, a dirty diaper on the floor, no toilet seat covers, no toilet paper, and the pad/tampon trash was full, you can see the bloody applicators. Granted customers left the restroom dirty, but it didn't seem as if they were checking up on the restrooms at all. I was literally trying not to throw up my food while I was in the restroom as I was already gagging in disgust. I didn't even use the restroom. We went here for my friends birthday and I felt as if they thought we were lying about it being his birthday.",

We brought the kids for the first time & they loved the cheesecake, but their meals were just \"alright\". Honey had the soup, sandwich & salad. Sandwich was piled high, but lacked flavor. Salad was standard Caesar. The soup was good, but we didn't find any of the artichoke that was supposedly in there. Cobb salad had way too much egg & not enough lettuce. I hate that they let people dining in park in the spaces designated for take out...that's a pet peeve of mine. Overall for the price it wasn't great.",

We waited, 20 minutes came and gone then it was 30 and 40 by this time my kids 7,6, and 16 months were growing tired, hangry and bored. It was a full hour of waiting and asking twice about our table. We were seeing people who walked in when we did and even after leaving having finished their dinner Very Disappointing! We get to our table and sit the silverware felt grainy almost dirty they took a while to take our order and even let ne'er to get it a whole hour to be exact. By this time the restaurant wasn't busy at all so no excuses. All the food came out except my sons pizza which we had to ask for after it seemed like she was busy attending another table. Food was okay except my meatloaf had aluminum foil still on it!! I told the server she takes it to her boss then she offers me another their meal which is nice but I'm not about to sit there another hour to get it. My daughters pasta was tasteless. I don't get it we go through the one at Caesars palace all the time and Never Ever had a problem there. I'm sorry to say I won't be back to this location. This wasn't the first complaint from here which made it easier for me not to come back.",

I use to go to the Green Valley location and we never had less than average service. However this location really needs to step it up. Reading through reviews and based on my past couple visits it's safe to say they always fall short in the service department. I mean the annoyance of the Cheesecake Factory at the forum shop is practically worth it compared to here.   Last night we order a couple appetizers and entrees and everything was \"half assd\". I checked into Yelp when we were seated and I had to refer back to my check in to notice it took over 15 minutes for someone to greet us. That was after I asked the busboy to get our server that was cleaning the table next to us. Then when the server came he asked us if we were ready to order our drinks as we stated yes he said h would be right back with our bread? Of the 2 appetizers we ordered we only had one brought to the table. Btw, don't ever order the Chicken Potstickers from here. They were too salty and nearly burnt. Stick to their firecracker salmon or avocado egg rolls. Someone at the table order the Steak Diane and Shrimp  Scampi (medium) and he was served well done. It was just careless acts after careless acts. Our drinks needed a refill we had to call on the busboy again. He took our drinks and brought them back without the straw. If we wanted Applebee's service and quality we would've went there.  We're definitely going to take our money elsewhere until they can do better!",

If I was just rating this restaurant on food, I would give them a 5 star, but upon sitting down I noticed that my spoon had dried food on it and the divider between the seat cushions had a load of food debris.  That said, I want to say it didn't have an impact on the food or the service.  Antonio was our server and he was excellent.  We started out with an appetizer of lettuce wraps, these with chicken and quite tasty.  The main course followed soon, my wife ordered a Mushroom Burger, mmmm delicious.  My daughter ordered the 4 Cheese Pasta and she loved it.  And finally I ordered a Macaroni and Cheese Burger, enticed by the idea of macaroni and cheese on a hamburger.  The macaroni was a ball, breaded and deep fried on top of the hamburger which was charbroiled and served with all the extras including fries.  What a surprise, this was a very good combination, especially if you like macaroni and cheese anyway.  The restaurant was very busy but that didn't affect service.  Antonio took great care of us and our drinks never got empty.  The downside here is that they do not have Raspberry Iced Tea, my favorite, but only had regular and a couple of bottled teas.  I settled for regular tea but didn't enjoy it or finish it.  And what would  a trip to the Cheesecake Factory be without some cheesecake?  While mom and I were stuffed from the burgers, our daughter had no trouble ordering a piece of Hershey Bar Cheesecake to go.  Overall, this was a very pleasant lunch and we will be sure to return.",

Cant wait for fall!  The red sangria is a must here too, they add fresh strawberries. We shared a mango and key lime slice of cheesecake and since I just like classic cheesecake, this wasn't a favorite. Kids shared a pepperoni pizza portions are huge!

I figured I'd try them again after the fiasco at the Green Valley one, where I felt bias from our server, which was evident from the poor service and lack of water refills and bread, compared to the tables surrounding us. A bit of a slap on the face to see them patronizing the ladies sitting next to you with the attentive service. Kind of overt if you ask me. Normally my dad tips really well too but he had it with this kind of service. I tip 15-20% but he tips 30-40%, sometimes 100%. So back to this location. I ordered spaghetti.  Sorry, nothing exciting here. Just had a craving for plain old spaghetti and giant meatballs. Which is what I got, fat meatballs and spaghetti that was cooked right. The sauce is salty enough and you get a heaping plate of noodles that can feed two. And the server treated us like everyone else, as in didn't tell us that they didn't have any rolls and then bring it out to the next table 3 minutes later, or the table across from them a few minutes later. Yeah, we got the point. You won't catch me going to Green Valley Cheesecake Factory again. Generally, I always liked CF, from Caesars to Boca Park to GV, to every other one I tried in LA and Seattle. But certain experiences ruin a place for you. CF is good, but in this town, there's a ton of places you can go to get pretty much the same thing.",

Their menu is tremendous, 100+ items  to choose from. From salads to burgers, pastas, and more. There is something for everyone vegan or not! I have probably tried almost every cheesecake on their menu except the key lime, not a fan! Carrot cake is perfect, not too sweet and just enough flavor and ingredients. The white chocolate rasberry cheesecake is our fave. Oreo like crust and curled white chocolate pieces on the sides with a hint of swirled in rasberry puree. Fried calamari is an appetizer to order. Lightly battered, perfectly seasoned and crisp! It's served with a garlic aioli like sauce and cocktail sauce.   List of our favorites... Chicken Bellagio- crispy coated chicken breasts over basil pasta and parmesan cream sauce topped with arugula and prosciutto.   Steak diane and Shrimp scampi- We enjoy our steak medium well. Very amazing flavor of marinated steak and shrimp. Mash potatoes were creamy and perfectly paired with grilled asparagus. Perfect all the time, won't disappoint!  Avocado egg rolls appetizer- The dipping sauce for this egg roll is what makes this soo tasty. It has a taste of honey, soy sauce and ginger.",

We were called up and she specifically said my cousin's name. My cousin went up there and said that's me. She pretty much looked at her and ignored her then looked at another group. My cousin repeated to her and said \"that's me\" then the host asked the other group \"are you....\" and they said no. She didn't even say sorry! Haha but I mean, the food and the server made up for everything. We ordered the fried calamari, Nashville hot chicken nuggets, chicken & biscuits and miso salmon. Oh my gosh! I forgot hot delicious the bread was and the food. I was so excited and starving. The food came out SO FAST! I was literally surprised because it was busy. Your entree coming out before your appetizers? LOL I will take that any day! Great portion size and so flavorful. We also ordered a side of ice cream with two slices of fudge cake. I know.. I know!! We didn't get cheese cake but that's the beauty of this place.. you can have your favorite cakes if you don't want the cheese cake :) I can't wait to go back! I want more of that biscuit. So delicious! Honey, creamy and just everything I want in every bite. Cheers!!",

I get takeout here often and sometimes my husband and I go here for lunch or dinner (he loves the Chicken Bellagio). I gave it four stars because some times the takeout can take a while if they are super busy and the service can really depend on your server if your dining in. It would be great if they opened another one in the area. I think part of their challenge is they get so slammed - open one in the Lone Mountain area!!! But seriously, I have found them to have good food and not be outrageously over priced there is a lot to be said for that.",

We sat and waited for a table for 5 minutes, normal. And then we sat down and met our waitress Nicole. She was fairly friendly, seemed like tonight was going to be a great way to close off the night. She took our drink order and brought it out in about 5 minutes. No biggie. Took our food order and the food did not come out for a good 50 minutes. All we ordered was a kids mac, avocado egg rolls (pre-made), some chicken pineapple thing (to-go), and some chicken lettuce wraps. Literally all the kitchen had to cook was chicken and put pre-made egg rolls in the deep fryer for the food at our table. It took almost an hour to cook chicken. AN HOUR! How does that happen? Whoever the manager is on May 28, 2019, for the closing shift. You HAVE to talk it over with your team. Nicole would look at our table, clearly see we finished the bread (after waiting 30 minutes, we obviously had to eat something) and would see that my glass of water was empty. She did not offer ONCE a refill on neither my water or bread. Not cool. I love the Cheesecake Factory, but tonight is what I would call an epic fail.",

From birthdays/date nights/graduation celebrations/Mother's Day to just about anything -- even casual weekends. I've been coming to TCF for years and have yet to experience bad customer service or food. No matter how busy it is, they always pull through with excellent quality service.    Fair warning: Holidays do tend to get quite busy for them so waiting time may range from 30-40min. However, it's completely worth it!    Favorite dishes: Chicken Madeira, fried mac & cheese, Louisiana Chicken Pasta Favorite sides: Calamari, sweet potato fries Favorite drinks: strawberry lemonade, pina colada, mojitos, mimosas Favorite cheesecakes: red velvet, white chocolate macademia  Tip: ask them to warm up the bread prior to bringing it out. I love it so much! Especially when mixed with their mashed potatoes. Yum!",

    "text": "I came here 2 days in a row for national cheesecake day and half price cheesecake. I was going to write my review Sunday, but I'm glad I waited because my Sunday experience was HORRIBLE, like 2 star bad, but my Monday experience was great, 5 star great. I averaged them out to give this review.   Sunday: We came in for cheesecake, but since we had to dine in, we git some breakfast that I didn't know they served on Sundays. The service we got the whole time was absolutely horrible. There weren't many people there when we got there so we didn't wait long to be seated. She brought us water and that was about it. The rest of the time we had to keep flagging her down to get anything from her. It took 15 minutes to get our coffee and actually order our food. Then she never came back. It took 30 minutes before we could flag her down to actually get us some bread that we had to actually ask for when everybody else was just given their bread. She was definitely not off to a good start. She kept going back and forth to the table next to us, giving them stuff and checking on them, but never came to us, unless we actually flagged her down and yelled for her. To me, that's not acceptable customer service. It almost made us not ever want to come back here. Only reason we came back, was to get more half price cheesecake the next day. We made sure we weren't going to get her the next day again, by sitting at the bar on Monday.  Monday: We strictly went to the bar in hopes we'd get better service. We certainly did. We initially came for happy hour drinks and cheesecake, but ended up ordering some appetizers for dinner since the happy hour menu is pretty cheap. Thank god we had good service at the bar or we probably never would've went back. Our bartender was always checking on us to see if we needed anything, constantly refilling our drinks, conversating with us, after everybody was taken care of. We even got our bread this time right away and didn't even have to ask for it. And to top it off, we got great service during happy hour when the whole place was packed and every seat was taken.   Now, onto the actual food.   For breakfast, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles Benedict and the chilaquiles carnitas. I really enjoyed the Benedict. It definitely had a unique sweet flavor that I wasn't expecting, but it was delicious. The carnitas was a bed of tortilla chips with a green chilli pork mix over them. I wasn't a fan of them, but my boyfriend enjoyed them. We also ordered their new cheesecakes: the celebration cheesecake and the coffee and cream cheesecake. The celebration one wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It was SUPER sweet. My complaint is that there was very little cheesecake in it. It was almost all cake and a cream mousse stuff. I was hoping it was going to be majority cheesecake, but it wasn't. I can't say that is order it again. The coffee and cream one, was very chocolatey with coffee. If you like those two flavors, you'll like that cheesecake.   For happy hour, I started off with the JW pink lemonade that was pretty good. We ordered 3 appetizers to share: Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, factory nachos and the buffalo blasts. They were all great. You won't be disappointed with any of them. They are pretty big servings so be careful how much you order. We couldn't even finish the nachos. Then we ordered cheesecake to go because there was no way we had room to eat there. We got the chocolate hazelnut crunch, Chris' outrageous, mango key lime and Reeses peanut butter. I didn't like Chris' because I don't like coconut or walnuts, but if you like them and almond joy, you'll love that one. My boyfriend loved it so much, he ate the whole thing in one sitting. I really enjoyed the other three tho. The hazelnut crunch is really good. The Reeses is really rich, but great if you like chocolate and peanut butter. The mango cheesecake us really tart, but great if you like those flavors.",

Annnnnnd when they have to go see if my food is done I get told how it just came up and when I check it - it seems like it's been sitting for at least the 15 min I had to wait for them to find her.

Despite this little hiccup, not only did the assistant manager come out to discuss the issue with us, so did the head manager Marco (?) and our server Douglas apologized genuinely as they had ran out and were working hard to remedy the situation. While mishaps happen when dining out, we were extremely impressed by this service recovery. Douglas is a fantastic server and the management staff were incredibly kind. At no point did we ask for a manager, they took it upon themselves to communicate the issue and we were very impressed with how the issue was handled. It made our New Year's Eve dinner even more pleasant.",

The lettuce wraps were good, and we ordered a piece of original cheesecake to take home.   The worst part about cheesecake factory at Summerlin, is that the service is very hit or miss. These servers know that the they will always be busy, so they really don't try  hard to provide good service. I'm not asking for much. It took 15 minutes to get our bread basket and butter, but they didn't remember to give us silverware. A few minutes later, the waiter brings out silverware, after I already took it from an empty adjoining table. The waiter had the nerve to give me a long, dirty stare. You just don't do that as a server, you apologize, and move on. You never stare at your customer when they are hungry and have waited so long for bread, butter, and utensils. If we ever go back, it is just to order a piece of cheesecake from the to-go bakery.",

I ordered Linda's fudge cake which i love but very disappointed with the size of the cake this time. Vey tasty but too small. I thought all the cakes were cut up before placed in the display! I guess not cuz this lady cut iup n boxed it up for me. I love cheese cake factory n the food but the bakery area needs to work on better their customer service. I usually go to Green Valley location which has great people working for the bakery that make u feel very welcome n feeling like coming back often.",

The food wasn't terrible but could have been better. We decide to order dessert and mine had a hair inside!! It literally flossed my teeth as I was pulling it out of my mouth! I was so disgusted my friend explained to our new waitress that it was gross I didn't want mine and she'll take a new one as she was scared that hers might have hair in it too since it was the same flavor. She brought me a new one when I said I didn't want another one...I was pretty grossed out a brand new slice is not what I asked for. Then the bill came and my cheesecake was still on there! $8 for a slice of cheesecake with hair in it? No thank you. So I ask for a manager and after waiting 10 minutes he finally comes by and is upset with me!! Wow, what amazing customer service that was. We tipped her $5 but I feel like there is no point in tipping someone who can't do their job. I can still feel that hair in my mouth today...I doubt I'll be returning to this location at least.",

Throw in their delectable selection of cheesecakes and I'm always in heaven. Not to mention the gigantic portions.  Recently CF has added a \"small bites\" menu which is the perfect size if you want to sample a bunch of random tasty treats. I don't think I'd ever purposely come here if given the choice but once in a while it truly hits the spot! Did I mention the cheesecake? Good, can't forget it.",

I went with my friend after our horrible experience at Aquae Sulis spa.  We  both had mint green teas and the lunch-sized cobb salad.  The mint tea was fantastic.  The salads were huge for a lunch size, and the ingredients were fresh and cold. I like that there was no fat at all on the chicken.  The dressing could have used a bit more flavor.  To finish, friend had the carrot cake cheesecake, I had the red velvet cheesecake (which I love!!).  We both left very happy with our desserts!!  Unfortunately, the service was pretty lackluster.  It took forever for her to stop by the table to take orders, refill drinks, pick up plates, bring the check, return the check, etc.  Maybe she was just having an off day, but like I said, if it hadn't been for the slow service I would have rated 4 stars!",

Cheesecake factory is like getting the same gift for your birthday every year, and you didn't want it the first time around.  You know what to expect, it won't make you happy, yet here you are again.  While always living up to my below average expectations, this place has one thing going for it, the decor.  It looks bright and nice and welcoming.  The food is average at best, and way overpriced for what it is.  Chilis or Fridays can match anything this place has, and at a few bucks cheaper.

If there was sugar on the table and a waiter that could be found I wouldn't have to get up in the first place. This is not The way you treat paying customers.

They literally have everything on their menu. This can be a blessing and a curse. There are so many amazing options it can be hard To decide. What I can tell you is this.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is amaze. It's Parmesan crusted chicken served over pasta with a spicy New Orleans sauce. The portion in my opinion Is pretty large. So you could share.   My absolute favorite however is The stuffed mushrooms. Mmmm. Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce. Some times when I eat It I want to tell the waiter I love him just for bringing me the stuffed mushrooms that I ordered...but at that point in our relationship we've only Known eachother for about 20 min so maybe thats to soon to take That step.   They also have amazing soups. I seriously doubt you can go wrong with one.  Now for all of you calorie counters. There's is a menu to make You feel a little Less guilty. It is called the \"Skinnylicious\" Menu. It's basically menu full of food saying \" eat me I have not Cream or butter.\"   Cheesecake has something for everybody. It's an excellent Place for a group. It is Pricier but manageable.  My Tip: GET THE CHEESECAKE. It's called the Cheesecake Factory for crying out Loud. It is simply not  to say no to a slice. I suggest the red velvet if you really feel in the mood To have a relationship with a cake. It's literally to die for. Not an Exaggeration .",

I have to call the restaurant & get her name as that is something I many times fall short about... Names:(   So I called her \"Blue Eyes\" during our dinner experience as she is a brown haired girl with brilliant blue eyes. She was very good natured... She smiled and laughed when I called her that and seemed to be ok with my nickname.  \"Blue Eyes\" arrived at our table immediately after we were seated & she took our beverage order... She was very welcoming & understanding as we explained that we were waiting for one more person who was joining us for dinner. So many times, servers can be put off by this... \"Blue Eyes\" was not having any issue with us having a late addition to our table.    After we enjoyed our first adult beverage, which was delivered to us exactly as ordered... I decided that for my next beverage, I would prefer mine without ice.  \"Blue Eyes\" was so pleasant and non-resistant.  She brought my drink out exactly as I had requested it. She was helpful & conversational, while respecting our privacy.  She made great suggestions and was so encouraging about several fished which we asked about.    The kale salad was scrumptious!!! We also ordered the Thai lettuce chicken platter. It is a Taste Blast and we actually ordered a second portion.  Bang Bang Shrimp/Chicken is always sensational here, but we were stuffed and did not have any room for more food!   An ahi tuna carpaccio was another delightful, tasty treat.  Whatever sauce they used was lavished on top with some beautiful slices of avocado & cucumber thinly sliced on the side.   Desert was of course cheesecake... I know the many flavors of cheesecake are supposed to delight me... This was chocolate & not my taste, although everyone else loved it.  Me... I Love their plain New York type cheesecake with some cherries or strawberries on top.  Yum classically delicious.   We had a Lovely time and I will post this as soon as I find out the name of our server who we will ask for when we return to this great local restaurant.   Ahhhhhh.... Her name is a Mystery... I called there & the hostess who answered the phone was zero help.  My bad for not getting her name:(",

Upon going to our table, we saw so many tables that were empty and ready to serve hungry customers.

We got seated in about 15 minutes, then had to wait another 10 for our waiter to check on us for our order. We had to wait about 30ish minutes for food, when our waiter came to tell us they dropped our food on the floor (try explaining that to a hangry 6 year old) and they would be remaking it asap. Anyways, the manager comes over about 5 minutes later and apologizes for the inconvenience and offers to refill our drinks for us. So another 45 minutes pass, we get our food and the bill, and I was just a little disappointed to see them charge us for the \"birthday cheesecake\" we received, and all the refills of the drinks the manager offered us. I get that I could have clarified, but from a huge chain I would have at least hoped when the manager came by to offer us refills since we were so \"inconvenienced\", that they would have been comped, or at least the damn \"birthday\" cheesecake after making us wait another 30 minutes for our food. Just a note - this review isn't about the money, it's just a shame to see that a huge chain like this wasn't more willing to appreciate their customers, they were only concerned with the turnover. Probably won't be back here, although the staff doesn't care anyways",

What a HUGE disappointment overall.  Why do people rave about this place?    Here are some examples:  Our table was 14\" away from the next person and the waitress had to crane her arm to serve each table stuffing her elbow in my son's face more than once.  Next I ordered the Fish N' Chips, on the recommendation of the waitress, only to be served breaded cardboard over soggy chips.  I was hard pressed to find the dry fish anywhere on that plate.  The coleslaw was a jumble of minced vegetables with some kind of light dressing which did not resemble anything I've ever known called coleslaw.  My son ordered a hamburger and out came this smallish, overcooked (even though he asked for mid-rare) dry burger, again with soggy fries. I could go on about the line-up of people waiting for a table while the staff were all talking and giggling and paying no attention to the patrons. Etc.  The whole experience was terrible and nothing like we expected.  We paid the bill and left, never to return to this or any location.  However, when I talked to my other son and told him of our ordeal he was shocked and said that it must be the location because he has had delicious food in the Denver location.  Just our luck!",

    "text": "So I've been to this restaurant many times but tonight was the worst ever. My 4 year old had to go potty so I left with him and had my mom order. We decided to get a couple appetizers and a kids meal. Well when I got back to the table my mom said that she didn't think the server was paying attention because when she repeated the order back she missed the kids chicken strips with fries and ranch. I didn't think anything of it but when the food was delivered it was kids chicken sliders not chicken strips. We did order a regular chicken sliders from the appetizer menu. So then Dina our server comes over and accuses my mom of lying and doesn't even apologize. It was very unprofessional. 15 minutes later here comes the chicken strips with a side of mash potatoes not fries that I requested. Also in the beginning I asked for the wheat bread and she brought out BURNT bread. It was black. Who wants to eat burnt bread? And as for the food the chicken was so tiny and hardly any meat that there was more bread then chicken. I don't know if they are having an off day but the food we had was not good and my mom had lost her appetite. Very disappointing.",

The first day was with a Facebook email.  The second day was with no coupon.  We tried the Dulce de Leche, White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut, Key Lime, and Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecakes.  We took an Original cheesecake and a Red Velvet cake home.  i liked those two the best and would order them again.",

    "text": "I normally would go to the Cheesecake Factory in green valley, where I've never had an issue, but since I was in the area with friends we came to this location.   I really was blown away by the level of horrible service we received, I barely even know where to start. First it took probably 20-30 minutes for our drinks to come (iced tea!). Even longer for the bread. When ordering, my mother was making sure her meal came with chicken and the waiter, in a disrespectful and condescending tone said, \"of course it comes with chicken, it's in the name.\" When my mother pointed out it does not say chicken in the name he continued to argue with her. I can't even tell you how long it took for our actual meals to come out and when they did my friends order was wrong and mine, being the last one out, finally came when everyone in my party was done eating!! Before my sandwich finally came one of the managers came to sort of apologize and quickly left our table before we could even express our unhappiness. The final straw was when our waiter was clearly trying to be rid of us, moving too quickly to hand us boxes and our boxed up cheesecake, he knocked over my half drunk (overly expensive) drink all over my phone and all down the front of me. He barely apologized for this and rushed off.   I really never complain let alone post anything like this but the service we received today was totally unacceptable and I will not be returning to this location. If I could I would have given this location zero stars.",

They should really take reservations because this place ALWAYS has a wait AND the waiting area gets CROWDED.  The wait is 25-30 minutes. 28 minutes later our pager goes off - It's go time!  Tonight Im starting with a glass of Prosecco. It's not as sweet as I would like so totally not ordering THIS again... I told our server I didn't like it and she was just kind of like Ooohkay...  We start with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and their complimentary table bread served with little pats of cold butter. It would be better if the butter was actually spreadable but whatevez. The soup is in an ENORMOUS bowl and pretty tasty. We ate about half and had the rest packed up. Chicken Chipotle Pasta for me it is! SO delish!! Perfect amount of spiciness that doesnt take away from the flavor of the dish - I love all the veggies mixed in with the pasta too along with the tortilla strips. I could probably just drink the sauce and be totally satisfied. Twice in the past I have tried a different pasta only to be disappointed so I'm just gonna stick with this WINNER!  Hunnie Bunnie is getting her Bow Tie Pasta in Marina Sauce (meatless) and she obviously loves it - she says it is her FAVORITE! So about mid-meal a very nice manager comes over and asks me about the Prosecco. I just told him it wasnt sweet enough to my liking and he took it away and OFF my bill :) The Cheesecake is DELICIOUS of course as well! Rich and creamy and NOMTASTIC! Ask for no whip cream if you're not into it.",

With one of the largest menu's around you'd think you could please everyone?...well maybe if everything they made was great....instead I am let-down more than I am delighted.  Most of their items aren't bad, but seldom does anything stand out to me.  I pity the servers here, and the corporate demands they seem to have to deal with...if it is obvious to the customer then it isn't working.  My go-to classic is the Chicken Madeira.  It is one of the better chicken dishes from a chain-restaurant.  I'm not really into desserts, but I can share the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake any time I'm here!  Needless to say I love my mom, and am more excited to see her than I am to come to The Cheesecake Factory...and being that we have a large family, The Cheesecake Factory isn't really all that bad of a choice...we cold do a lot worse!",

We arrived and were promptly seated after  a few minutes.  We were there during a shift change and had two servers. Both were attentive, friendly, and professional. They made our visit enjoyable.  The food was awesome! After I decided what to order. The menu selection is huge. My wife had the chicken taquitos, which were very authentic and dang good! I had the Steak Diane and herb crusted Salmon combo. The Steak with the sauce and mushrooms was very flavorful. But the star of the meal for me was the Salmon. I normally don't order Salmon at restaurants but the description sounded good and our server indicated that it was wild caught, which was the selling point for me. I'm just going to say that it's the best Salmon I've ever had at a restaurant!  Nough said!  Overall this is the best experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I highly recommend a visit to this location.",

Then finally our waiter came by and told us the order was never put in. They should've told us before we had to ask three times!

The steak was seasoned well, as were the sweet potato fries.  Breakfast is served all day.  The omelet was huge (easily enough for 2 hungry people) but nothing special.  Needed a little salt.  It was served with potatoes fried with onions.  Didn't look all that appetizing because the onions were in a big clump instead of being more evenly dispersed.  The restaurant floor was not wet but slippery.  It felt to me like someone spilled something oily and it got tracked around.  The men's restroom was very disappointing.  Had a long puddle of water under the sinks.  Granted, it was after 9:00 with a 10:00 closing time but I still expect better from a sit-down restaurant.",

I swear our server kept returning to our table, never mentioning the bread because I felt like she was trying to make us forget that we had asked for it.   It frustrated me so I reminded her that we asked for it and she brought us two loaves.   Another friend got a vanilla milkshake and it wasn't that great.",

They were super busy, but even through their business, Alex was an amazing server.  He was cheerful and thoughtful.....he made us laugh.  :) It was an addition that made our night better.  Food was great, dessert was insanely great and service was phenomenal.  It just gets so busy and the setting is pretty loud so we don't come here often.",

I became very cozy with my neighbors children on our most recent visit. I did however have my best meal ever at TCF, Hibachi Steak. Totally random item I have never seen anyone mention,  but it was amazing. Our waitress warned me it was \"spicy\", which it wasn't,  it could have used more spice in my opinion.  But she said that abput our appetizer and warned me my lemon raspberry cheesecake was very tart.  We clearly have different taste buds.  I just wish it wasn't so over priced, so over seated and so loud.",

He had the odyssey to walk behind me and said to rewrite the tip and the total. We will go out or way and just go to The new one that just oped up in the north premium outlets.",

    "text": "Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory?!! This place is all things to all people but they are far different than these other establishments that try to please everyone. The other places lack in quality because they are trying too hard to offer too many mediocre dishes. This place has both quantity of menu items to choose from and they are prepared with quality as well.  Although your Vietnamese spring rolls or your sweet corm tamales aren't the most authentic you've ever had, they are pretty darn tasty. And I don't know about y'all but I'll take tasty over authenticity anytime. That's why I'm the only Asian you'll see at PF Chang's. Haha.  Today I was there for my friends bday. I just started eating clean--so to speak, so I ordered the most compliant item I could find and that was the Kobe burger. It had three ingredients. Very basic and consisting of: tomato, mushrooms, and grilled onion. I got it protein style of course. I normally would never, ever order a burger without cheese but I had to this time. For how plain it was I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It was Sofa King good! So flavorful with juices dripping out from the wrapper. I was not embarrassed to be heard slurping that stuff up. Not gonna waste any of that tasty burger grease. But please people, don't order a Kobe burger if it's gonna be hotter than med-rare. That's just a waste of good meat. If you're scared of a little pink in the middle, stick to your fast food burger joints.   And of course...who doesn't order a cheesecake when they're at CCF? Me. Whomp, whomp. I had to stick with the bowl of strawberries. But for those that are not on a primal aka caveman aka paleo diet, they have just about any type of decadent combinations a (non-pregnant) person could think of. I will have to treat myself to one of these some other time in the distant future.",

    "text": "As always, the food is great. However, the service is deteriorating. For the Boca Park location, it's not a good look and definitely not expected. The rude bartender (a somewhat aged blonde female who wears her hair pulled back in a ponytail) was absolutely a HORRIBLE reflection of this particular location. She never ONCE asked us if everything was okay, if our food was how we ordered, if we needed anything, etc. she served the people around us, avoiding us. I had to slam the plastic ketchup container on the counter to get her attention. She stood in front of us numerous times making drinks and never once said i word. Seriously, if you don't like the job, find another one! She was the same exact way the previous time we went there and unfortunately had her. There were two guys at the end of the bar who were loudly complaining about something as well. I voiced my complaint to the manager, but somehow I wasn't convinced this issue will be addressed. A lot of these servers have the mentality of who they \"think\" will and will not tip. Well I have news for the ones who think that way: YOU'RE the one messing up YOUR money, not the client. I definitely laugh at the ones who THINK they deserve a tip no matter how they performed. Well I definitely have a tip for them: don't walk in dark alleyways at night.  If you can, steer clear of this particular bartender. She's not a professional at all and if these are the type of people that CCF will employ, you're better off eating at Red Robin.",

    "text": "This is a late review. Went here a month ago for my nephews 30th birthday celebration. There was 12 in our party. We ordered appetizers, drinks, and entrees. Our appetizers came out at a decent time. One of our appetizers which was the calamari tasted spoiled and didn't smell good so we sent it back and they made up a new batch for us. All of us got our entrees except the birthday guy. He ordered the combo chicken with filet mignon. They said they forgot to fire up his order. It wasn't the waiters fault because he put in the order. They said they were backed up in the kitchen. We were practically almost all done with all of our entrees and the birthday guy still hasn't received his entree. The manager came out and said it will be out soon and that they are not charging us and that our table can get up to 5 free cheesecakes and the birthday guy can get a free cheesecake on the house. So finally the birthday guy got his order when we were all done eating except his 2 cousins waited for him to get his food to eat with him which was nice of them. But he wanted steak medium rare so it wasn't to his liking because it was more well done. All of our entrees were cooked to the way we liked. The waiter and manager was very accommodating and gave us great service despite the mix up and that's why I gave them a 4 star otherwise I would've rated them a 3 star. Cheesecake Factory has always been a place to go for drinks and desserts and food and we've never really had a problem till now.",

Deducted a star since we were served burned bread and some of our pasta dishes had burnt ingredients mixed in. I ordered the Louisiana Pasta and it was surprisingly good, although the spicy flavor was lacking (a lot spicier the next day, after soaking in the sauce), but the chicken was made to perfection! I usually hate ordering anything with chicken since it gets over cooked and dries out, but this breaded chicken was still moist and lightly breaded to my liking. My SO mentioned my chicken tasted kind of burnt, but I didn't think so (just looked a tad darker than it should have). My new favorite at Cheesecake Factory which I haven't found in awhile. I hope they don't get rid of it. One of my friends ordered the same entree and he drowned his pasta in chili flakes and tabasco sauce lol. I also ordered the cucumber lemonade, one of the best flavors, the others are on the sweeter side. Don't forget it's free refills!   As I mentioned, service wasn't bad for our large party and on a Saturday evening around 7pm, we occasionally had to ask for refills, but our server did come check up on us from time to time.",

We've also had some great service, quick seating and food served quick and correctly. We do love the cheesecake and a few menu items, so we tolerate the hit and miss of a big chain restaurant from time to time. But after eating half my salad I found a black bug in my next bite and now I have to draw a line. Obviously these things can happen with produce, I've found bugs in my lettuce from my grocery store. I didn't make a big scene and the manager did come and apologize and offered me something else. I declined and they took it off our bill. While I can be gracious and understanding that it's (hopefully) not anyone's intention to serve me salad with a bug in it, I will not eat here ever again.

The food portions have really shrunk.   I ordered the Diane steak and herb salmon.  My wife got a tiny square of salmon.  The portions were Quite tiny.   I remember cheesecake being good and I always brought home leftovers.  This time my wife and I both finished our plates clean.  The taste is still good though, but just the potions have shrunk.  Blame it on the economy, maybe, or maybe just blame corporate greed and the bottom dollar.  That's how these franchises like outback, red lobster, apple bees, sizzlers go downhill.  They start reducing quantities, cut costs, stop innovating, and pretty soon they just go by the wayside.  Seems like that's what's happening here.",

Don't expect actual mashed potatoes, more like baked potato put in a blender for 10 seconds, very lumpy, but ok.

I'm not sure if they have changed things up as they became a huge chain or my tastes have shifted, but the quality seems to have taken a hit. It's still good, but not something I would normally spring for.   The cheesecakes are the best thing here of course, and the other cake slices are pretty damn good too. I would give them 4 stars if I was just judging desserts.  The menu is enormous, so they have something for everyone. For a big party of all ages and sizes, it makes for an easy pick that everyone can be okay with.",

This is a great place to go if no one in the family can agree on what to eat.  We started off with some cheese sticks and a Greek salad for an appetizer. The sticks were not greasy and the cheese was melted to perfection. I like how the cucumbers were cut differently in my salad, it made it extraordinarily refreshing. Perfect amount of dressing too! Oh and free bread with butter.. everyone loves that!  The portions were HUGE. Thanks to our server, she gave us a heads up on lunch sizes vs dinner plates. The lunch portion of the chicken fettuccini Alfredo was a full plate.. I can't imagine what the dinner portion looked like! I still had some to take home!  You can't leave this place without ordering a slice of cheesecake (Stuffed? Of course you are! Just ask for it to go.) I had the BEST flavor.. the lemon raspberry cheesecake with lady fingers. They have a full page on their menu of different options to choose from.  They have great customer service too. You will leave here with a fully satisfied belly.  PS. It really is nice that they post pictures of the food on their website. Almost every selection had a picture. It's helpful when you really don't know what you want to eat and don't eat here often. (In case you want to look before you go)",

This location can be very busy during lunchtime on the weekdays and on the weekends. So if you're coming during those times, be prepared for a wait. Typically the wait time goes by quickly, some nights it can be 20mins plus. Last I checked you couldn't call ahead to reserve a table...but maybe they changed that?   The lunch specials are a great deal and perfect portion size. Dinner portions are rather large, I feel like two people could easily share. And, as always, the menu is huge with something for everyone. Desserts are the same, something for everyone. If I'm not craving cheesecake, I enjoy the strawberry shortcake. It's not too much, but delicious. Most of the cheesecakes are too indulgent for me.",

I guess there was a shift change because a new woman introduced herself as our new waiter.  She was not much better.  She seemed very attentive to her four top to our \"miesly\" 2 top.  Then a waitress by the name of Amanda noticed that we were trying to get our servers attention. She was quick, helpful and attentive to our needs. Getting us our 20 min waters in seconds and sharing her story of her new life in vegas and being employed at cheesecake only a month(and killing it). She dramatically changed our moods in a very positive way.  We will be back and will only sit with Amanda!",

Today we came in and were served by Isaiah. What an amazing server! He was very energetic and paid attention to small details that separate good servers from superior servers. The service staff here at the Boca Park location is 90% great but today was extraordinary. Even after our server got sat another table after us and a party of 10 at the same time, our experience was never sacrificed. Our drinks were never empty, our order came out prompt and we were never in need of anything.  Tonight we ordered iced green tea with mint, the chicken marsala and chipotle chicken pasta but we substituted the pasta for mashed potatoes. And for dessert we shared a lemon, strawberry cheesecake.  Chicken marsala is 2 thin pieces of chicken in a homemade marsala sauce with a generous portion of mushrooms. This is served on a bed of bow tie pasta. The chipotle chicken pasta is a flavorful dish with asparagus, peas and chicken in a warm chipotle sauce. It's not spicy and does not lack in flavor. The portion of chicken is on the lighter side though. All entrees are served with both sourdough and wheat bread with butter at the beginning of your meal too. There are so many desserts to choose from but tonight we went with one on the fruity side. It wasn't too sweet or too tart. I was actually surprised how balanced the flavors were.",

Only problem is that their staff doesn't seem too friendly. Although they do get the job done it would be nice to have a few smiles on deck here! Great food! Great atmosphere and great menu variety!

There was three small pieces of chicken over powered by the mushrooms which tasted a little burnt.  The lunch portion appears to be around half the size for almost the full price. The portion size wasn't an issue since the food was not palatable. It wasn't a good value at all.   My wife got a salad off the new light menu and it was basically just lots of lettuce.   Service was slow. We had to ask for refills many times and were never offered a refill unless we asked.",

I usually don't get the dessert because it's overpriced but we went for it this time. They all look great but don't taste great. I had the Celebration cheesecake (I.e. birthday cake ) and there was no taste. Tasted like sugar free cake with no cheesecake in it. My friend got the lemon meringue and it was so tart you couldn't even eat it. After a couple bites we gave up and left it. $20 down the drain... (they have the gull to charge $9/slice plus tax and tip). $75 total for 2 people for basic food. Servers try hard but they are always overworked and stressed and became so busy takes forever to get your food...I've been to the one near downtown (at the the outlets)several times and same thing. I go because they have a lot on menu but it's overwhelming to try and read it all.",

    "text": "Ahh Lets See.. The Cheesecake Factory Summerlin which is located in Boca Park was pretty decent! I usually have crazy dining experiences with this place however I started to learn what exactly to come for. If you are a Cheesecake Factory fan you know that the menu is insanely overwhelming so it really takes patience to figure out what you want. I was introduced to there short window happy hour (4pm-6pm) a few months ago and fell in love! The prices are so doable and you really can get a bang for your buck when it comes to both the food and the drinks! I went in to this location hoping it would be just as good as the other one that's in the Premium Outlets! It was! Not only is this one closer to home, but it's more fancy and the service was great! Our server was very friendly and attentive! She was even able to get me to try some new appetizers that I've never tried before which was the nachos! That's always a good way to win me over as a customer when you can have great conversation, make suggestions and extremely attentive! Can you say Great Tip '-) For these nachos to be just an appetizer you can easily share with another person. If you're like me and want to take advantage of the entire happy hour menu grab some friends and order everything on the menu. Ball out! My suggestion would be to go not right at 4PM which is the start of happy hour because finding a table top or even a table in the bar area is competitive. You literally have people preying on these tables waiting for people to get up so they can swoop on in like a hawk haha. I arrived around 5:15 PM which is when the first greedy crowd is about ready to wrap it on up!. After about 3 long island ice tea's in and pigging out on the spinach dip, crab dip, wontons, sliders, and nachos it was my time to GO! Thanks to the Summerlin team I now can add another happy hour spot to my list! Their runner up (Kona Grill) is walking distance and has a fantastic happy hour as well!",

Usually we can wait less than 10-15 minutes for a table, by the time we leave it's a mad house. Waiting times up to 45 minutes. We learned to come just before the rush or come late, after the crowds, either way, service is still good!  We never feel rushed, our service is always great and the food is consistent. Love the +30 cheesecakes to choose from. Be it a holiday, weekend, or weekday, they really make you feel satisfied.  My favorite new dish this time was the soy glazed edamame! It's spicy, it's slighty sweet, it's warm and very good!",

    "text": "TLDR: expansive menu + kids', long waits, standard service, inside/outside seating  This California-based company prides itself on continuing Oscar's and Evelyn's dream of providing excellent cheesecakes and desserts in a bakery setting. I'm not so sure that this is reflected in today's restaurants, started by their son, David.   My family decided that we would venture into the not-so-upscale Fashion Village at Boca Park. Because Cheesecake Factory boasts an expansive menu, even for the kiddos, I guess I wouldn't mind holding our spot in line for our large party. A promised 45-minute wait, although expected at peak dining hours on a Saturday night, was cut down to about 25 minutes: an unexpected, but welcome, plus! The host stand seemed filled with unnerving hostesses as well as the hustle and bustle of seating all the walk-up guests. They probably needed a break and a reminder that every new customer deserves a positive experience.   Upon seating, I was immediately greeted my by waitress. Her smile appeared genuine and her customer service rhetoric was unwavering excellent. I was impressed. A secondary server/busser provided bread and waters for all the guests without question. It was fantastic. Our waitress was very accommodating, making suggestions, attentively listening to our requests/restrictions, and tending to the needs of the young children at the table. Upon everyone's food delivery, a manager approached my table to discuss the reason as to why my salmon salad wasn't delivered yet. He stated a vague, yet wordsmithed response in which he basically stalled for an additional 7 minutes. The \"fish just wasn't right\" probably meant that it wasn't cooked yet, it fell on the floor, they forgot, or any combination of two. A specific, yet honest answer would have been more appreciated. Isn't honesty the best policy?  Although the selected dishes varied, I will comment on what I tasted during my experience. My salmon salad for $17.95 was delicious. An herb-crusted salmon topped field greens, cut tomatoes, endive, and asparagus paired nicely with my glass of iced green tea (suggest simple syrup from the bar to accompany the drink). The salmon looked at least 8oz and did not overpower the dish. I recommend the ranch in lieu of the vinaigrette. The children's pepperoni pizza can be a little spicy for children, so be wary of your picky eaters. The tostada salad is a mouth-watering heaping mound of greens atop chicken and a tostada. The lettuce wasn't dried/spun prior to plating and, therefore, left an unnecessary pool of water on the plate and tostada (which transformed into a soft taco shell). The meatloaf is average: nothing special and nothing exciting. Save yourself and select an alternative dish. For dessert, the limoncello cream torte was to die for. Layers of vanilla cake christened with lemon marscopone allows for a sweet dish worthy in lieu of any dessert wine.   As we received the check, our desserts were double charged, a strike two for our experience. With the tardiness in food delivery, accuracy of order, and initial experience, I rate it 3/3.5 stars.",

    "text": "Went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time in a long time. Boy was it mediocre! My wife and I walked in at about 3:30PM and it was almost entirely empty. My wife is currently walking with a cane as she is recovering from knee replacement surgery. The hostess greeted us and promptly told us it would be about a five minute wait - please have a seat. WHAT??? five minute wait in an empty restaurant??? Did she see the cane? Does she know that 95% of the tables are wide open? I am not exaggerating, it was 95% EMPTY!!!!   OK, let it go... she was stupid. We were seated in about three minutes - just long enough for my wife to uncomfortably sit down and stand back up again.   Food took a LONG time to come out - especially considering how busy the kitchen was (sarcasm). I ordered the herb crusted salmon salad from their new \"skinnylicious\" menu. My wife had the Steak Diane/Chicken Madiera combo. Hers was what you'd expect - typical Cheesecake Factory OK meal. Mine on the other hand was UNDERWHELMING. Our server informed me that the salmon on this salad usually comes cold, unless I would like it heated. I opted for warmed. Big mistake. Their idea of warmed seemed to be microwaved to the point of shriveled and hard around the edges. Also their idea of salad seemed to be dump some greens out of a bag o' salad and dress it up with a couple of sticks of asparagus. Come on guys... make me a fresh piece of fish and use some higher quality greens. Like I said, UNDERWHELMING!  I really expect that in a restaurant, they should be able to prepare/cook a piece of fish better than I can at home. I also expect freshly cooked, not what had to be cooked yesterday (or last week) before it went bad and then refrigerated to hold it for leftovers for the salad.   Lots of staff standing around with a dirty floor. No one seemed to care. My guess is POOR MANAGEMENT and POOR TRAINING. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, but you have slipped about three notches and I won't be returning.",

Cheesecake Factory is one of those places that has one of those huge menus where if you can't find something to eat, clearly your not hungry or having some of interstellar hunger breakdown.  Having been to cheesecake in a few locations around the states this Factory has all the bells and whistles you come to expect from any other franchise.  Ordering the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and the Chopped salad for our main we dived straight into the massive portion of food. Make sure to always come hungry. They have a small kids menu as well as high chairs for the kiddos!!   Since the Mains are pretty big my suggestion is try to order the small dishes if your looking for the amazing cheesecake! My favorite cheese cake is the Carrot Cheese cake. Some of the chocolate cheesecake can be pretty amazing as well. Also if your not a Heavy cream person let them know as they like to stack a massive cream side to your cake.   As for service, expect a line if your coming at peak times, usually 7 days of the week this Cheesecake Factory is busy so don't be surprised when you might have to wait a while.  Overall a great place and can be recommended for almost any occasion",

Once food came she never came back to see if we needed anything or to see if we wanted another beverage. Then we sat and waited and waited for her to come by and give us our check and go boxes. Additionally instead of picking up my glass by the base to move it out of the way she grabbed it by the top with her hand over the top. Very unsanitary.

When they bring boxes or cheesecake ask for the check. The food is great here, very consistent. Love the Oreo dream cheesecake, fried macaroni and cheese, chicken piccata, banana cheesecake etc.",

    "text": "Sadly, The Cheesecake Factory on the westside in Las Vegas has never truly measured up to the brand. You're always better off visiting The Strip. There are too many eateries in the area to take any chances at this location.  The Cheesecake Factory on the westside has a reputation for a 50-50 split between enjoying the meal or feeling sick. During our last visit, sick meant food poisoning.  After eating the lightest meal at this location -- fish and chips -- the next week resulted in one of the worst bouts of food poisoning ever. I should have known. The fish tasted frozen and as if it had been left under the heat lamp too long. It should have went back, but after a long road trip, no on had the energy to wait around.   Afterward, the incident was reported. The company claimed to do an investigation, said they could find no evidence that could trace the sickness back to the restaurant, and promptly sent the absolute last thing anyone in my family wanted to see -- a gift certificate to go back. No thank you, ever.  There is nothing wrong with The Cheesecake Factory, but there is with this one. Avoid.",

    "text": "It's been close to 15 years since I last ate at a Cheesecake Factory, and that was in SF.  I was visiting my sister in Vegas, and apparently they order takeout from here often.  So that's what we did.  I was trying to be \"healthy\" so ordered the Santa Fe Salad.  What was I thinking?  McDonald's makes a really good Santa Fe salad with breaded chicken (probably totally not healthy).  I actually kinda love it, though I don't go to McDs often. I was hoping TCF, with their reputation, would have a version just as good. But no, it was just what I imagine a \"healthy\" salad being.  Lackluster in flavor with not much to recommend it other than the fact that it was relatively healthy.  My sis had the apple pork chops.  She really liked it, though I personally am not a fan of sweet savory.  The mashed potatoes were excellent, which I remember from my visit 15 years ago.  My brother-in-law had the Davinci pasta dish, which is one of the 2 dishes they said they almost always order (the other being the shrimp scampi).  I only had a taste but my god, that was good!  It really didn't look like much because the sauce seemed fairly light, but the flavor was amazing.   Cheesecake tiramisu. Drool.  I like cheesecake and I like tiramisu but I don't generally love either.  I LOVED the cheesecake tiramisu.  Fluffy and light, all 3 of us agreed this was utterly delicious.  Portions were huge for all the entrees and well worth the price.  If I ever go back to a Cheesecake Factory, I need to remember:  Davinci & cheesecake tiramisu.",

Don't get me wrong... my family and I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. It's a guilty pleasure....   The things that irked me about this particular location:  1.  Parking: what a pain! luckily they had valet (which we used...awesome!) however we had a large party and one family had a baby and i KNOW they parked uber far and had to carry the infant seat and everything....  2.  Service: what a nightmare.  I don't even know our server's name.  All I remember is she was blond, and short (not in stature, but attitude-wise).  Granted we had a large party (13 people) ... uh oh... here's where i go off on a rant.  So we had a large party.  It was my (pregnant) sister-in-law's birthday. We had 3 children with us 10 adults... we all arrived within 10 minutes.  We had asked the server to wait until we were all here to start taking orders.... but she didn't feel that was a good idea.  I personally felt that we got the short end of the stick because we were a large party and she felt she did not have to give us good service because she was already getting auto-gratted.  Boo on her.  Tip karma forces my boyfriend (who picked up the tab that night) to automatically tip AT LEAST 25 percent (instead of the, what, 18 percent auto gratuity on parties of 6 or more?)  anywho, drinks came out staggered. menus came out staggered.  food came out staggered.... all because the server did not want to wait the few minutes for all of us to be seated and get situated.  rawr.  and on top of that, some rude lady in a near by booth kept shushing the 2 4-year olds with us (one being my daughter) and shooting dirty looks my way. lucky for her my parents taught me to respect my ugly... i mean elders.  That all being said (please excuse my poor grammar/run-on sentences)...  bottom line:  food was consistent with every other cheesecake factory out there (yay for avocado eggrolls and THE BEST fried mac and cheese in the world) but the service was shoddy (really though, WHY would you bring out dessert for everyone else and then make the 2 restless 4-year old girls wait 10 more minutes for theirs? who does that?!?)   I'll stick to the location in Henderson, or even brave the strip and head to the Cheesecake Factory in Caesar's.",

I've been to this particular location about 3 times already. I tend to always order the same things - Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, Mojito, and Low Carb Cheesecake. It's just right and I don't feel like crap afterwards. This time around, I order the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. It was ok, but I wish there was more shrimp and chicken - it seemed to be dominated by the tomatoes and pasta. The wife had her usual - the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Dessert was a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Veruka said she was going to share it with me, however, she is one of the few women in the world that doesn't like chocolate. She had one bite and quit. I ended up eating the whole thing myself. Well, It looks like I'm gonna have to do a juice fast this week - this meal will put at least 5 pounds on me! Service this time around was good - the server was attentive and brought us everything in a timely manner. 3 times a year at the Cheesecake Factory is more than enough for me.",

Being a waitress on the strip for six years and with the company for 10 I know what guest service is... You, are terrible. First off, coming to the table and not making eye contact with the people you are speaking to is not ok. Second your stance is confrontational, almost like you were looking to brawl. It's aggressive and not very welcoming. I would like to say you were at some point just overwhelmed with your tables but as I continued to watch you, I realized, no you're just a terrible waiter. You didn't care to engage you didn't care to answer questions and you didn't even bring me out spoons for my cheese cake. Seriously, who brings dessert and no spoons? I would like to point out that I wanted another orange juice and my boyfriend another glass of wine but you wouldn't know because you never asked. It's ok Also, I get there are busboys but if they aren't around it means you clear my table, you're not above clearing a table. For the record I cleared most of my dishes onto the dirty table next to me since my table wasn't cleaned once during our meal. I did have to ask twice for the check the second time you pretended like I never asked a first time. You're also human and not above being able to say I forgot let me go get it. But passing blame is easier. What a stressful lunch. Honestly, my cheese cake didn't even taste good after all this. My experience out weighed the potential to have a good lunch. It will be a while if I ever come back to eat here I would be too afraid to have your section. Not to mention kona grill is remodeled and looking way more appealing than a waiter who seems to want to fight me and ignore me.",

    "text": "Based on the ratio of positive and negative reviews I guess we got lucky. Immediate seating for my family of four at 6:20pm on a Tuesday. The hostess was pleasant upon our arrival, and she wished us a good evening as we left. Our waiter, Sean, was courteous and attentive. My Cobb salad was tasty and large. My wife enjoyed her Asian chicken salad & her tiny $10 margarita, and the children seemed to enjoy the pulled pork sandwich with fries and the kids menu chicken strips with fresh fruit. My water glass never went empty which is a major factor for me. Haven't tried the take home cheese cake yet, but in the past it has always been yummy.  We had a huge booth away from the bar and TV which was nice because I found myself enjoying my family instead of the basketball game on TV.  We'll be back.",

The servers were running back and forth like crazy and it was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think. I had the chicken lettuce wraps and my husband had the Shepard's pie. Although,The food was very appetizing. Late that night I woke up with food poisoning. I hadn't had anything else earlier that day to eat so, I came to the conclusion that maybe the chicken was bad. Down and out for 3 days. No fun! Was very displease with this last experience here. It's going to take me a while before I tempt to eat here again.",

Took at least 10 to 15 min to make a order after I asked about a meal he said I have to be at the different table and I'll be back. He was gone for 10 min again. I asked for brown bred he brought a white one and just dropped at the table and was gone. We had to ask a lady to get it but she just told him that. Now he brought only 1 peace and we where 3 person at the table and it was dry and cold. We had to ask if he could refill our water never happen, he never come just walked by. We asked for straws as well never received any. This service change our mind to come there again. I better drive to different locations but not there.",

The issue was our order, the restaurant gave us a call saying they were out of Nashville nuggets which was a big upset. Secondly, I told the lady on the phone I wanted everything extra spicy she said that she could make it \"a little\" more spicy which that was something I didn't want to hear after I said I wanted it EXTRA SPICY and told her twice over the phone to ensure it was understood that I wasn't it extra spicy! They couldn't make the buffalo blast more spicy, which was understandable. As for the Cajun jambalaya pasta which was suppose to be somewhat spicy to start hence the name \"Cajun\" jambalaya pasta wasn't spicy at all. My girlfriend ended up eating the shrimp and chicken out and giving the pasta to the kids since it wasn't one spec of spice in sight.  As for the buffalo blast, everything fell apart and it was hardly any blue cheese. I'm very disappointed and extremely upset with one of my favorite restaurants. Our expectations were definitely not met for our early dinner tonight!",

Once seated, our server JESSICA was absolute trash. The silverware on the table was clearly dirty. Jessica barely came to the table and when she did we had to ask her to take our appetizer orders then didn't see her again until we stopped her passing by requesting to put our food order in. Two of the guests ordered an item on the menu and she returned 20 minutes later letting them know they didn't have that option on the busiest day of the week. We asked for bread multiple times and took forever to receive it. We did not get refills in a timely manner or any quality service. All we got from Jessica was attitude. The order came out and there were multiple issues. On top of that she left and didn't even let us know she was leaving. Our next server, Nathaniel, he tried fixing the issues but there were so many you could tell he was irritated as well. We requested to see the manager who came to the table, listened to our issues and said he would be right back. He never returned either. This service was terrible and very unacceptable.",

I ordered the orange chicken and was quite satisfied. My girlfriend ordered shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Both of the meals were largely portioned.  We were too stuffed to order dessert.

I bring it to her attention and she says she's going to retrace her steps and see if she can find it . She returns not even a full 2 minutes later saying she lost it . LOST MY CARD ! she then says \"I'll pay for your food girl, I got you\" What about my missing card ?! wth are you going to do about that?!

Yes we know to blow on the food to help out but still the cheese sauce for the Mac n Cheese was lava hot.   STILL will be going back!",

I had the chicken salad sandwich which was more mayonnaise, than anything else. They even put heavy mayo on the bread when the chicken salad was already oozing with mayo. The salad was poor quality, and the server was not knowledgeable of the menu. There was four of us, so overall the food was delivered properly. The server did not offer to correct the matter, but asked if I wanted to talk to a manager. She should ave just taken the food and had it served properly.",

Of course we have to have dessert here, so ate only 1/2 the entrees to be able to share their scrumptious Godiva chocolate brownie sundae. Hmmm...food coma. Definitely one of favorite places to do, consistent in all locations I have visited.",

Food was bad, pasta was mainly sauce with a few pieces of pasta swimming around, burger was subpar and well below most places even with the higher price.  Went in with getting cheesecake in mind and left without getting since everything we asked for took so long to appear.   Will not be going back here",

I also hate all the ads in the menu!! Isn't this place big enough not to have ads. There always seems to be a wait even though there are plenty of open tables.

I came with a friend last week to chat over dinner and we must have waited about a good solid 10 minutes before our waiter came to take our order.  Our waiter was friendly, but seemed to have way too many tables to tend to making hard on him to please everyone he was serving.  The poor guy was stretched thin and it was a bit hard trying to find him so we could get condiments to our table that he or his food runner had forgot to get.  My friend ordered the beef medallion with mash potatoes, which she liked very much. I ordered the lean burger with side salad and it didn't turn out the way I requested.  I wanted my burger well done and it was not and unfortunately my salad was not very fresh, but I ate my food anyway, because I was like starving already.  Overall I didn't really enjoy my food, but I'm more than willing to give this place another try and taste something else on the menu next time I eat here.",

I had to move quickly to avoid the waiter hitting my face with his elbow when he brought the food to the other table and to make things worst as I used my spoon to try the salsa for my tacos there was a dried up piece of food on it, didn't see it since its a bit dark inside.  We had to laugh since the food was great  But had to yell at each other since the table to my left was so loud and to make things even more interesting, the gentleman on the left started to pick his nose.

We ordered an appetizer called Dynamite Shrimp it was sooooo good the sauce it came with was half part of the yummy factor! On to the bread they serve while you order, it was really good. For my actual lunch I ordered the Parmesan Chicken.. very tasty. I looked at the other items and found why order and burger and fries when I can get a dinner for three $$ more and take it home for lunch the next day! My Mommy in law got a noodle dish and she said it was delicious. We both had left over food to take home. So yes I'll be going there again..even just for that Dynamite Shrimp! I'm craving it now lol. Mmmm Server was Mike, he was very good and checked on us plus bagged our food to go. Very nice gentleman he was!",

If you don't feel like valet, they have a private lot for parking or there is a parking garage.  I love to start with the \"Avocado Eggrolls\" and if you have never tried them you must! They were priced at $10.50 and can easily be shared.  My favorite thing to order for my meal is the \"Carlton Salad\". It is huge but I manage to polish off every last bite because the awesome flavor keeps my fork going back for more. The salad was priced at $13.95 which is fair for the size and amount of fresh fruits & veggies in it.  The only problem is I never have room for one of their many choices of fabulous cheesecake for dessert so I pick one to-go. This last visit it was a hard choice but they are all so good I new I couldn't go wrong with the \"Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake\".  If you don't feel like eating inside or outside on the patio, you can phone in your order for pick up. They say to wait in your car and they will bring out your order but if I phone in a order I usually just go inside and pick it up because they are always so doggone busy.  I noticed on the menu they offer catering.",

No one in the family can go wrong with the amount of choices they offer, and of course, there is cheesecake for dessert!   Our waiter took an extraordinarily long time to take our drink order & to bring bread & butter. After we gave him the drink order, we still waited an extraordinarily long time just to get drinks, and still had to remind him of a beer that we ordered. When salad came, there was a toothpick in my son's salad. Had the toothpick got into his mouth, he could have choked, cut his mouth, or any number of things. One of the side dishes we ordered didn't come with our order & arrived much later. Overall, it was one of the worst experiences I have had at The Cheesecake Factory. Be forewarned about this location. Very disappointing!",

In the last several visits I have had to send food back.  The food is just not up to what I typically get from Cheesecake Factory.  The bread is overcooked, pizza is raw and has very little ingredients, stuffed mushrooms are small and over cooked, no croutons on the Cesar salad,  chicken on lettuce wraps were rubbery and gamey tasting, things are left off what is stated on the menu, etc.  While they are nice to try and give you another dish, by that time you are put off by the quality and really do not want anything else.  It's too bad, as most location are pretty good for a \"chain restaurant\", however this location really has some issue in the kitchen.  To end on a good note...Cheesecake is always good, but probably due to the fact it is made elsewhere and frozen and brought it.  Sorry about the negative review, however after so many attempt to try and get something good, that has just not been the case at this particular location. :(",

Have gotten the truffle tower chocolate cake on 3 different occasions and each time it was a different size, getting progressively smaller. 1st time it was a nice big slice of cake like it should be, 2nd time I got it to go and it was shoved in a small to-go box, broken in half and looks like the bottom was gone. So I told a manager, and all they did was put the broken cake in a larger box, ignoring the fact it didn't look all there. 3rd time was worst of all, I got it to go and the piece was small. Both in length and width of the cake! Definitely not a tower. Not happy at all and I would suggest keeping an eye on the portions they give you and complaining if you feel you were skimped on. Not that it helped for me.",

    "text": "Strictly talking food, this Cheesecake Factory gets four stars. On the weekend, parking is hard to find, but it's a pretty awesome location with other new shops and family activities. The experience though, knocked it a star, otherwise it would have been one of my favorite restaurants we checked out this weekend.  I ordered a Flying Gorilla beverage to start and it was pretty much my favorite part of a very, very late lunch. Still, we all were able to order from the lunch menu. I had the Avocado Rolls to start, followed by the Chinese Chicken Salad. Everything tasted great, though I'm not a huge fan of the thin, white crispy noodles. I should have asked for them to go easy on that, because there was literally a mountain of it (hence no photo).   Appetizers came out fast, but everything else was weird, honestly. My sister ordered a Pina Colada to start and then a Pepperoni Pizza. I don't think she was a huge fan of the drink, but she said the pizza was pretty much what she hoped for. Even at lunch, the portion was rather large. Leftovers, yo! Only problem is she got her food way before our friend and I. She was almost done by the time I got our food.  Our friend ordered Calamari to start, which I would recommend to everyone, because their Calamari is always so good! Lightly fried, crispy bits of octopus makes for a great appetizer and big enough to share! She ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and seemed to enjoy that as well.  So what happened to our bread? You know that thing they usually bring out at the very beginning at every Cheesecake Factory? Apparently they were running behind on a lot of our order, which was surprising for a weekend. Tina our server was as helpful as she could be, despite not being able to get everything out at the same time. The bread didn't even come out until we were ready for the check, so that was kind of annoying.   I would only recommend they staff the kitchen properly on a Saturday, no exceptions. Other than that, I genuinely had a nice time at Cheesecake Factory and am curious to explore more of Summerlin in the future.",

    "text": "I came in here for dinner with my husband last night as we are avid Cheesecake Factory lovers and diners. I ordered my normal, chicken piccata with no dairy since i have an allergy  (but oil is fine) and the server kept telling me it couldn't be done. I told her i always order it and it can be and to please check with the kitchen (i was just asking for them to use oil rather than butter and cream.) she told me it wouldn't taste good and i should order the chicken bellagio instead since that's easier to do dairy free. I should have stuck to my guns since i know it can be done and it seemed like she was trying to be helpful so i said ok that's fine I'll try the new dish. 20 minutes go by and no bread i see another server walk by and ask them if they can grab it for us as we hadn't seen our server since then. The other server brings us bread and our server walks up and is semi snippy and said the wheat bread was in the oven that's why we didn't get bread (still she could have offered us white or at least communicated with us.) then another 30 minutes go by at this point I'm like where is our food this is ridiculous it was 10:30 pm so not dinner rush hour. Our server let me know they made my dish but they realized at the end there was cheese in the basil pasta they make the chicken bellagio with and were remaking it. I was happy they caught that but annoyed af this point because i really wanted my normal order. She brings us the food. I eat the two thinly sliced grilled chicken breasts with the dish but the pasta is disgusting so i wait and i wait to let her know i don't like it and she never comes back. I flag the hostess down (at this point it's been 15 min since the food was dropped) she gets the server and i could tell the server was just annoyed and ready to go hone and she said no problem I'll twke the pasta off but I'll just charge you for the chicken. At this point i was ready to leave as we had now been in the restaurant two hours and i was tired and a manager never came up to our table to inquire about the long wait on the food or why i sent it back so we just left but now that it's a new day I'm really thinking about what a bad experience we had. I'm not at all worried about the $5 chicken charge but i really feel since the waitress wouldn't check with the kitchen on if chicken picatta could be made the way i always get it, and the long wait on the food, she was just being catty with me to charge for the chicken. Will I return to Cheesecake in the future? Sure this was the only bad experience I've ever had here in my dozens of times being here but i probably won't be back for awhile. In today's world where a ton of people have different food allergies, you should train your staff better on how to deal with them rather than acting annoyed and inconvenieneced by them. For some of us, our food allergies are deadly.",

I've tried a couple of different burgers. All were seasoned very well and cooked perfectly.  Their cheesecake is great, but the best option is the Oreo cheesecake.   I ordered delivery so I'm not sure what it's like inside of the restaurant, but I'm sure the food is probably even better without the long ride for delivery.",

    "text": "Wow! I never anticipated having a bad meal at the Cheesecake Factory! But it happened today. There were three of us and we each ordered salads. My sister ordered a vegetable salad and myself and our other companion both ordered a Cobb salad. Each of the salads looked like something from the bottom of a night worth of kitchen lettuce scraps. Drenched in oil and vinegar dressing with no seasoning . The chicken were tiny scraps as well and few of them. I found myself searching the salad I am so accustomed to CFs sumptuous and flavorful Cesar salad. The egg had been pulverized into crumbs. You may wonder why we did not send these salads back! I actually got the wrong dressing as I had requested honey and mustard though it was delivered as such. The waiter was excellent. And I am sure he would have addressed the situation but honestly I was so surprised by this meal.. I was home before I was honest with myself that this was unacceptable. Was this unexpected outcome.. a new chef in the kitchen.. or simply salads on a budget. None of us ordered dessert.. that alone was a first! I ate a delicious meal here just weeks ago for my birthday.",

I continued to poke around and really enjoyed the mashed potatoes but the chicken. Let me tell you. It felt like it had been microwaved and had a really rubber texture to it.

They literally have everything from Chinese to burgers. I've tried multiple things off their menu and everything has been amazing. The orange chicken is some of the best I've had. Of course the cheesecake is amazing as well. They also have a pretty large selection of cheesecake to choose from. Last time we tried the new Reese's cheesecake and omg it was amazing. We usually get the Adams peanut butter which is very similar but the Reese's was very good. I highly recommend this place especially if you're with a large group because the menu has so many different options it can please everyone. The wait can just get kind of long but it usually goes by pretty fast and it is more on the pricey side (average $40-$50 for two)  but still not a bad price for how good the food is.",

Convenient parking spots for pickup orders. Otherwise, the parking lot is pretty occupied.    This is a very popular place (when we were waiting in the car, we spotted so many people coming and going). Funny story about this one. On our first date, we tried going to this one, but it was so jam-packed, so we went to the Caesar's Forum Shops location instead. This was in 2004. And that is what got the ball rolling.   Large menu- it's like sixteen to twenty pages long. The food is solid. It's yummy. I've had lots of items here over the years. So has our son. We do love the complimentary bread starter. (When we used to live on the other side of town, we went to the newest location inside the outlet mall.) So, yes, we are very familiar with the food and restaurant. The service is very good.   A really good restaurant with great eats, great service, and so many choices of cheesecake (really lives up to its name).",

    "text": "I really enjoy Cheesecake Factory. I've been here a variety of times in the past, but recently came here with a friend Wednesday night to catch up.  The parking is spacious. It's a street over from Tivoli village in a complex next to REI and a few other restaurants/local businesses.   It can get really busy over the weekend. If you're looking to stop in for a bite to eat, I would highly recommend going during the week day either before 6:00 P.M or during the day.  My friend and I sat at the bar area. We were greeted by the waiter with a smile and offered drinks/drink menu. We passed and just ordered soda/water. We ordered a few different appetizers, the mozzarella sticks and the corn appetizer dish. I thought the corn appetizer dish was pretty spicy. The Mozzarella sticks tasted good, not too spicy, not over-done, and the marinara sauce on the side was delicious!  Unfortunately, we couldn't enjoy the appetizers too much as our main course came out 5 minutes after we had received our appetizers. My friend had ordered the chicken avocado club sandwich and I ordered my usual chicken pizza (which literally is chicken as the \"dough\" topped with cheese/sauce and a light pasta in the middle). Both of our meals were amazing and the portion size is large. My meal that I had in the evening was left overs for both lunch and dinner the next day.  We had ordered a desert. My friend ordered the normal \"classic\" cheesecake and I had the red velvet cheesecake. WOW! It was so sweet and perfect. The cheesecake was light and fluffy. I would order both again!  The reason why I am giving this a 4 stars out of 5 is I actually had a really bad stomach issue after all of the food. I was so sick the next day that I could barely function. I'm not sure if the food was under-cooked or a ingredient was old, but I was really sick the next day.",

Son in law had the Spicy Cesar Salad and Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  It was great- had a little kick.  Daughter had the Crusted Chicken Romano with white sauce vs. marinara.  I had the Grilled Steak Tacos.  The food was fabulous.  My vegan daughter was worried about what she could eat but was happily surprised to find that they have the Impossible Burger.  This is the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5.  They serve a burger that is meant for vegetarian or vegan customers, but the bun is not vegan.  She had it like a lettuce wrap so not a huge deal but something to consider for your vegan customers.    The cheesecake- well what to say?  5 stars!",

Our orders came and everybody enjoyed the food. I only give it 4 stars because the white rice that came with my Carne Asada Steak was dry and hard with a lump of burnt rice included. The steak was soft, medium rare but it was ruined when I had my rice. It was like eating a left over rice. Hopefully they dont serve that again next time.",

And I think it's because you guys might be a little understaffed for how busy you are during dinner.   They may also all have a little bit of a pride issue. Because I've had two waiters make mistakes not bringing my drink or forgetting about our dessert, and then getting really defensive about it when I ask again for the missing item.  I've worked in a restaurant before and it reminds me a lot of very experienced servers or lifetime servers. Sometimes they just feel like they've been there so long that they can do no wrong.  I spoke to a manager once before and even she seemed overwhelmed.   This leads me to the conclusion that the employees and managers are understaffed and a little stressed out.  I would really appreciate it if you would schedule and hire more ppl to work here bc I will be coming 2-3 times a week and would like better service.   Thank you.",

It's creative and has unique options. Even their take on original dishes is different! I go with the California Cheesesteak most times. For appetizers, the mushrooms and spinach dip are always great.   I mentioned the takeout being horrible last time. If my experience was based on this ONE time, it would be a one star review. However, after going many times (before and after) it would be unfair. It's justified to take a star, though, because the experience is not consistent.   Also, it is a little expensive. Two dishes, one shared desert and one shared appetizer ran us $70 after tip. It was disappointing paying $15 for a sandwich that was inedible (again, only the one time for takeout).   The deserts are phenomenal, obviously!! It is the Cheesecake Factory after all. My favorites are the hazelnut crunch and the tuxedo! My girlfriend favors the cookie dough.   A little hidden gem is the cold brew coffee. I am a coffee connoisseur, so I know a good cold brew when I taste a good cold brew!",

I ordered a salad, full size. It was lunchtime. I  wanted to save half to take to work tomorrow. Normally I  can't finish a lunch portion but it's never enough for another meal. Well when I got home and saw my salad,  it was barely a lunch portion. I had the bbq ranch chicken salad. This is my favorite dish, so I know this salad well. I always get an extra dressing because the salad is so big there is never enough. Well the salad was so small I had an extra dressing  left. Used it on my bread. Oh did I say bread, yeah well I  ate the bread which I don't normally eat bread, that's how small the salad was. Quite disappointed. And I have nothing to bring to work tomorrow.  When I say small there were only 2 yes I  said 2 slices of avocado and the very bare minimum of chicken.  The reason I'm writing this review is because I just remembered while there, there was a lady at the bar complaining about her chicken portion was smaller than normal and the bartender took it back. Not sure if there is someone new in the kitchen and if there is,  they need more training.  I won't discredit for  service or quality of food but this order fell short for cheesecake factory standards.",

We went around 6:30 on Saturday night and were seated in around 10 minutes. It was very busy, but our waiter was attentive and friendly. I could give 5 stars for the drink called the Georgia peach alone. It tastes like a drink from Carnival cruise ships called kiss on the lips. I have spent like 10 years trying to replicate it and can't. Now, I have somewhere to get it. It is $11 which is steep for a frozen drink, but oh my wow!!  The bread they serve is amazing. The sourdough is perfect. My husband had steak, I had the crusted chicken Romano, and my son had a quesadilla. Everything was great!  Now for the cheesecake....holy mother of choices. How do you decide on just one?!  My son (who is 6) always has Linda's fudge cake. It takes him 3 days to eat it because the slice is about as big as him. My hubby got the red velvet and that will be my choice next time because it was soooo good. I had the white chocolate macadamia nut and it wasn't bad. It's the only complaint if you can even call it that, but my piece of cheesecake was really small. The slices are always huge and mine was half the normal size. Maybe it was the last slice or whatever. Regardless, wonderful experience. Great food. Left stuffed. Go there.",

    "text": "Let me just start off by saying it takes a lot for me to right a bad review.   My first bad experience happened back in December of 2014. I love cheesecake's salmon and I ordered it this time like I do every other time. It tasted awesome, but I regretted it later on that night. I was sick and throwing up from it from about 9pm until 1 or 2am (and I was getting on a flight to Mexico at 6!) luckily it wasn't full on food poisoning or I would've missed my trip!   My second bad experience happened last night. We placed a to go order for two southwest chicken sandwiches and a slice of cheesecake. When we arrived to pick up our order there were 3 other people standing around looking pissed and waiting for their orders. We waited about 15 minutes before one of the employees came over to us and told us that they could not find our order in their system. We then waited another 15 minutes for them to find the order (the order taker put it under Taylor even though I spelled my name out to her over the phone, she obviously wasn't listening). Another 15 minutes passed and we finally received the food. If you are counting that's 45 minutes waiting for a pick up order.  We got home and ate the food.... The fries were soggy, the sandwiches were luke warm, and the marshmallow on top of our lemon cheesecake was melted and unrecognizable (but still tasty). Fast forward 2 hours and we were both sick. I took pepto and thankfully was fine but my boyfriend was not so lucky. He has full on food poisoning!!!!   We will NEVER eat at Cheesecake Factory EVER again.",

It is an actual hand made Veggie burger full of veggie and rice and what not, though it does have a purple tint to it because of the beets, I think, it tastes just fine. It comes with fries YESSSAA which are pretty darn good and on a nice bun. It is a little soft, so some people might have it fall apart on them, but I didn't so that was good.  It really tells you something when the Cheesecake Factory can make their own Veggie burger and other places, who claim to be all down with Vegetarians, cannot.",

Seriously it's a fried protein on top of a fried starch, it's kind of a no brainer but this  was just so bland and mushy. Also it came out lukewarm and got cold while I waited the ten minutes for the rest of my party to get served their food. My nephews all got burgers that were over cooked. Overall this was not a good restaurant experience.",

Plus, there is toasted coconut all over it. Very good.  My fiance got the chinese bun tacos. He said they were excellent.   I also love the eggplant sandwich with snow peas and carrots for the side.   I try to go here on an \"off-time\" because it can get very very busy.",

Took my husband for his birthday and as usual had a nice table and a very friendly waiter at least in the beginning. Didn't have the bread we wanted and said it was cooking. Took order then i announced I would like a cake for his bday. He said no prob. Then we never saw him again. Another waiter brought the meals and another waiter never introduced herself. This happened 2x! He could of said I will be leaving now and ... Will take over. Never got the bread that was baking. Then the other waiter said to go that she will give us the white bread and full roll. Wrapped in foil the bread was dark. Omg then she overcharged for desert etc etc..... I love the factory but something doesn't seem right.",

My two grandchildren ordered sliders and French fries with ketchup on the side. My wife ordered lettuce wraps. Now I need to tell you how picky and particular she is with this dish. After the first bite, her comment was \"this is the best lettuce wraps I've ever had.\" My daughter ordered a grilled vegetable salad which was excellent. Last but not least, I ordered Boulliabaise, over a large bed and portion of spegattini rested fresh muscles, clams, shrimp and white fish. Another excellent dish and choice experience a fine meal. We will make the Cheesecake Factory a special place for us to dine. Thank you so much!",

I grew up eating at the Brentwood location at least once a week & sometimes Marina Del Rey for a party etc. I now live away from Cheesecake territory so I get so excited for Pumpkin Cheesecake every year and am so excited when I can actually partake.... tonight we went to the Las Vegas Boca Park location for my dad's birthday (I swear the pumpkin cheesecake had absolutely nothing to do with choosing where to eat) and it was the WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Dirty silverware, our server didn't even know we were her table so we just sat there until we said something then we were pretty much invisible the rest of the time. Then topping off the experience we were told to pick a dessert to be brought to the table to sing 'happy birthday' but when the check came we were charged for it.  Our server was a very sweet person,  but regardless, whatever the reasons, we all left saying that we felt ripped off - the food was mediocre the service was shitty then that ... and it wasn't inexpensive. I don't think any of us are returning anytime soon and if I do it definitely will only be in L.A.",

I have come here so many times for family events and despite our hopes the service will get better it never seems to. The knowlege of our server was unacceptable.  Showed up at 4:15pm on a Wednesday. We were seated within 5 minutes for a party of 6. I went to the Restroom upon arrival and it was a mess. Also there was only 1 stall with toilet paper.  Drink orders came along and I asked oir server Tara G what they had for tequila. I was told Patron. I asked if there were other silver options and was told no, just Patron. I passed and went to the bar to order instead. Come to find out there was 4 options of silver tequila. Don Julio & Patron being the most expensive naturally.   We wanted to order appetizer, but after recieving our drinks our waiter took too long to return to our table. We ended up just ordering our entrees.  I asked if my dish the Diane and Salmon came with asparagas and was told no, so i ordered some on the side. The dish comes out and there is asparagus with it, and a side of asparagas as well [which of course I had to pay extra for].   My sister ordered the chinese chicken salad. The salad came dry with no oranges.  I noticed the food runner come out and have a conversation with out waiter where they looked at the food delivered to our table. It seemed as if they realized the wrong salad was delivered, but upon us questioning it we were told no thats what you ordered. At this point we just asked for a side of dressing and oranges.  For the price and location I honestly would expect better management and training of staff.",

They always meet these expectations; High quality, good tasting food, excellent beverages, very good service, and a classy ambiance. You normally have to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated. There's a very good reason why people wait that long to be seated.   Based on my experience from yesterday, I had to give them four, instead of five stars. We were told there was a 40 minute wait, which seemed to be pretty accurate. I noticed that they wasted a lot of time, and energy on trying to find 4 or 5 parties who had obviously left. On several occasions they walked through the bar, waiting area, and exterior of the restaurant calling these people's names. A more efficient way of handling it would be to activate the buzzer, walk through once or twice calling their names, then move on. I felt our server wasn't very friendly, and a bit slow. The food was very good. I would highly recommend the crab bites, and the Steak Diane With Salmon Combination. The fried zucchini was okay... They were good, just not excellent. I was impressed at how clean the bathroom was, based on how busy they were.   I would definitely return to this Cheesecake Factory again. I would also recommend people eat there as well.",

My food was outstandingly amazing! We started out with he Ghirardelli cherry cheesecake that was superb!! I ordered the Renee lunch special and it was nothing short of amazing. I literally got a half of a large tomato with my salad, I love tomatoes! My hubby got the club sandwich that was actually seasoned (no places I've been to season them) with a generous portion of fries that were still very warm and perfectly cooked. We will definitely be going back in the near future (probably even tomorrow ). Thank you for the exceptional service!",

    "text": "I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in like three years, so my roommate and I decided to break the three-year-long hiatus and try it out for dinner once again.  We were seated fairly quickly despite it being a busy weekend night and having no call-ahead for a table.  They had a fancy interior, the dining room was dimly lit (just like all Cheesecake Factories), and the noise level was a little louder than average (it can get quite noisy).   As for the food, we started off with the avocado egg rolls. It may sound weird, but they're actually SO GOOD. Who would've ever thought that this unique twist on egg rolls could be so delicious? It's fried in an egg roll wrap stuffed with avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.  A must-try for avocado aficionados (or for those who are tired of the standard guacamole)! The sauce it came with was sweet; it was the perfect pairing with the egg rolls. Let this appetizer satisfy your tastebuds with its Avocado-ey goodness!  My main entree was the Louisiana chicken pasta. It had Parmesan crusted chicken (the breading was crunchy and the chicken was juicy!) over farfalle pasta with a sauce that has a bit of a spicy kick to it. This is seriously some good pasta. If you want something that's super filling, I'd go the pasta route.  Presentation of the food could've been a little bit better, but the food was great nonetheless.   Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how good everything was from what I remember. The Cheesecake Factory is probably the best option if you don't want to go anywhere super fancy for dinner.",

Last time they gave me a chicken-tender-sized \"salmon filet\" with my $15 salad (photo attached) and this time they forgot to add the salad to the Mexican Tortilla salad (no photo attached, because hungry). Granted it's my responsibility to double check my food before I pay and leave but I really shouldn't have to do that, ESPECIALLY when the cashier checked it right in front of me. There's supposed to be a certain level of trust there but hey, silly me right? I thought someone would be paying enough attention to my order to at the very least give me what I paid for. How do you forget the salad in a salad dish? I'm not convinced that it's an honest mistake when this sort of thing has happened to me twice in one month at this location. Not only did you screw me out of $30ish, you broke my heart Cheesecake. That's so not tight.",

Shortly after, the food was served. He came around frequently and checked on us.  I love that the food maintained its quality and flavor, each time we come here.

We enjoyed fried Mac and cheese, lobster cake bites, corn tamales, beet and avocado salad and meatloaf. We loved it all, but my favorites were the corn tamales and the beet and avocado salad.   We haven't eaten at Cheesecake Factory in three years, but we won't wait that long again. I'm already thinking about what to order next time and I will save room for desert.   Ate here for the second time. We again sat on the patio for immediate seating. This time the misters were not working so it was a little warmer but not unbearable. This time we had the pork sliders, house salad with citrus honey vinaigrette and corn tamales. The pork sliders were so good. Order contains four sliders which was the perfect amount. We will go again and try the avocado egg rolls!",

In my experience, the service in Las Vegas can be hit or miss. Sometimes the service can be great like the last time my boyfriend and I were there. Our server was extremely personable and attentive. I never once asked him to refill my water and he came to check on us the perfect amount of times to see if we needed anything. Sometimes the service is terrible. Once our server came to get our drink orders after sitting for 10 minutes. I'm guessing he was new or was never told he had a new table. My boyfriend's water had a weird residue at the bottom of the glass and it took another 10 minute wait to get our waiter to come back. We finally had to get another waiter passing by to get us new water. We were also both extremely hungry that day but weren't given bread because according to our server, \"there'd wasn't any bread ready.\" How is that possible? I suspect this was a lie and he just forgot to give us bread.   Overall, if you have time to wait and are willing to gamble of the service, you should come to Cheesecake Factory. The food is always good and the portions are huge.",

Parking at that time is simple but it's a nightmare from 4-8 pm. They do offer an underground parking garage for the business complex if you don't mind a small walk.   The service is always friendly and the wait time is never awful. You can call ahead and put your name down as well. They also have a happy hour from 4-6pm.   The menu is big... like huge. They have chicken every and all ways. I don't eat chicken but my boyfriends favorite is the chicken parm. He also likes the blackened salmon... my go to is the vegan Cobb with the dressing on the side... it's probably the best salad you will ever eat in your life. When the artichoke is in season... we get that as well. Everything is reasonably priced and they offer a kids menu. There are numerous restaurants throughout the valley so give one a shot and get the vegan Cobb!! It's the perfect summer salad;)",

    "text": "National Cheesecake Day at The Cheesecake Factory should be a nightmare right? Well one would think so because ordinarily it's pretty hectic on every other day of the year. But this year, a server named Jessica C was an Angel in disguise. Knowing that they opened at 11 and cheesecake slices were 50% off today, we decided to meet up for an early lunch at 11:30. Surprisingly, we were seated immediately and warmly greeted by Jessica.  She brought out our water, Diet Coke, and raspberry lemonade promptly as well as their amazingly fresh bread. My husband decided to order the Skinnylicious burger with a side salad. My son ordered the cheese flatbread off of the kid's menu. I always try something new and so I went with the lunch portion of Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. Normally when we come to Cheesecake Factory, we wait so long that we fill up on drinks and bread. That's not always the server's fault, but oftentimes we get neglected and are sitting with watered down drinks or empty bread baskets for a while. Not today. Jessica was right there to top us off and refreshed our drinks. When our food came out, I was pleasantly surprised. My son's flatbread pizza was ginormous! How is that possibly a kid's meal? What a deal! The flatbread was soft, fresh, and very tasty. My son kind of filled up on his bread and lemonade though and didn't eat much (also saving room for cheesecake of course). My husband was very happy with his skinny version of a burger. The side salad was basically greens with a vinaigrette dressing (which he saved for me to take home since he was making room for bread and cheesecake). It was cooked medium just as asked and presented without any of the extras, just as he likes. One of his pet peeve's is asking for his burgers plain and they still decide to top everything on it. Not today! I was surprised with the size of the LUNCH portion of Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. LUNCH!!!  I think it was $5-$6 cheaper than the full dinner sized. How much bigger could this have gotten? The penne pasta was perfectly cooked. It was drizzled with olive oil and the mixture of broccoli, roasted eggplant, roasted peppers, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts was a cacophony in my mouth. I was definitely content with this blend of flavors. I actually ate as much as I could (and took about 1/2 home). Last but not least, you have to save room for the cheesecake which was the main reason we came here today. At 50% off per slice, how can you resist? Technically you had to dine-in in order to get the deal. We had a full meal and so we hoped we could take it to go. My husband decided on chocolate mousse, my son chose Hershey Chocolate Bar, and I tried the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. While we waited, Jessica happily refilled our drinks again and brought us take home containers and bags. When she brought out the cheesecakes, we noticed they were plated and not in containers. She said the cheesecake station were told not to put them directly in containers but that she would get us some. Of course we still ate a few bites before transferring them into their containers, but the fact that she didn't just tell us tough luck, was a miracle in itself. This was the best experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory both in Las Vegas and in southern California. Jessica C, we truly hope you get the tip we happily left you for your amazing service. Until next year...or at least until the next cheesecake promotion!",

I had dinner with a bunch of friends on a Monday night and luckily my friend went early. He was there at 6:30 (possibly earlier) with a 45 minute wait. We didn't get seated until almost 8...on a Monday.   I had the fried calamari and spicy cajun jambalaya pasta (penne) with chicken, shrimp, tomatoes, bell peppers and onions. Upon getting my dish, the plate for starters, is unnecessarily big given the portion that they offer. While they definitely don't skimp on the chicken, I had to do some pasta pushing to find the shrimp and I only found about 3 pieces of shrimp. Keep in mind, this pasta dish is not going to contain a lot of \"sauce\", like a regular jambalaya. In fact, it's as if the dish is only seasoned with Cajun seasoning, rather than an actual jambalaya recipe. That said, I did have to add some salt because there was a lack in flavor.  The calamari was also nothing noteworthy - although crisp to perfection, it was a bit over battered. Would this be my go-to restaurant? Not at all.",

The portions are huge so I recommend not filling up on their delicious bread.   Food Everything on the menu is simply delicious. Everything that I have tried has been yum and there is plenty of food for leftovers. My favorite has to be the chicken taquitos as an appetizer, parmesan crusted chicken with mash potatoes and steamed spinach as an entree, and yummy cheesecake for dessert. They have a huge selection for any craving from burgers, pasta, steak, and fish.  Dessert Of course they are famous for their delicious cheesecakes but they offer more than just cheesecake. If your are interested in their cheesecakes my husband love their Resse's Peanut Butter Cheesecake, and I love their red velvet cheesecake. The also offer a birthday cheesecake that I have yet to try, but have heard great things about it.",

    "text": "It's a sad day when a restaurant you loved now serves your favorite meal with only a semblance of what it once was. Long gone are the two hearty pieces of chicken, in their Chicken and Biscuits, which had once been reduced to a nice sized piece, and now small medallion sized pieces chicken, reminding me of non breaded chicken tenders, pepper the plate. I'm wondering if I even had a quarter cup of carrots and peas. The biscuits were so hard I wasn't able to cut into them nor pull them apart,  and had to request new biscuits, which honestly weren't much better, and the gravy, well, at best it was room temperature. I knew better then to send my food back  After what seemed like a struggle for my child's appetizers, which arrived somewhat tepid, I just requested new biscuits and realized that maybe I should have listened to my father and went out another day besides Mother's Day to celebrate and dine.   Although I will say I believe we dodged a bullet.   While the table next to us received their salads I was STEAMING MAD. They weren't even sat when I ordered an appetizer, that we were still waiting for, for the baby.  However, when their meal was supposed to be served the waitress informed them that she'd forgotten to place their order, and it would be just a few more minutes...almost forty minutes later they were still waiting and we left with them only having received their salads and nothing else. Mind you management had already came to the table, apologized and let them know that their meal would be on the house.   It seemed as though Jasmine has been serving for some time, she didn't appear to be a novice. I'm not one to piggyback on complaining and I was trying to be patient due to the fact that they were busy with a forty five minute to an hour wait time.  It doesn't make it better and I'll think twice before I dine with them again.",

    "text": "Although I had been here once before just to purchase holiday gift cards, on my first foray to this Cheesecake Factory for a late dinner on Veterans Day I was pleased with what I encountered.    We didn't plan to go here at all.  Instead, while headed to its more elevated cousin, The Grand Lux Cafe at The Palazzo, we were diverted by traffic cones and police cars from entering or crossing the Las Vegas Strip.  Then we saw why, as several tagged runners passed us by.  We unwittingly wound up in the midst of the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon!  After looping onto Sammy Davis Jr. Drive and finally emerging from \"the dungeon\" to reach Flamingo Road, we buzzed across town to Rampart, reaching this comfort food emporium at 9:55 p.m.  Luckily it was open to 11:00 p.m.  While Diane struggled to finish an app of tennis-ball-sized Mac & Cheese Bites perched on a bed of Alfredo Sauce, I was presented with a gargantuan tray of Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps that could easily accommodate four diners.  But, alas, there was only me to play with the thick strips of peanut-crusted chicken, ultra-fresh and cool thinly sliced cucumbers, carrots, delicate noodles, lettuce leaves, and trio of sauces: brown and smooth Peanut Sauce, orange and spicy Chili Oil, and green Cilantro Sauce.  Somehow I polished off everything but one large leaf of lettuce.  I also got to sample Chicken Artichoke Soup, the soup of the day, at the urging of our very thoughtful server, Katrina C., who also brought extra napkins to the table and Iced Tea refills on her own initiative.  The soup was creamy and delicious, punctuated by large Button Mushrooms.  But I wisely chose not to order a cup or bowl of it.  For, a Hibachi Steak entree seemed quite enough to round out the meal.    The steak was thinly sliced, seared with a Hibachi Sauce that was a cross between Teriyaki Sauce and Soy Sauce, and quite tasty, except cooked more medium than medium rare as ordered.  Ample quantities of Mashed Potatoes and asparagus spears filled out the plate.  Although the menu called for Mashed Potatoes and succotash, I was actually pleased to be presented with asparagus instead of succotash.     Diane liked her Penne Shrimp Alfredo but took half of it home to go along with half of her Mac & Cheese Bites.  We both rolled out of the restaurant, fully stuffed, at around 11:15 p.m., the last customers to leave the premises.",

We go there pretty often, either at this one or the one near Green Valley Ranch. The most recent trip was disappointing. We had a super nice server, but our spot had glass on it and then a server offered to package my meal for me. I just went to cook my leftovers to find out that I had saved half my meal for nothing. All that's in my box is a sad piece of chicken medeira. They threw out my sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, and saddest of all, a huge mound of mashed potatoes. I purposefully left so much food behind so I could have a really good lunch later, and I trusted them to package it because it's been done before.   For the record, this is now the second time this has happened. Last time it was with a pasta entree, which was really sad. They left me like a single piece of chicken on top of dry noodles instead of packaging the whole thing. Why on earth would a person want only part of their leftovers? It's just a bummer, as I've been really sick and can't prepare meals for myself right now. I thought I'd have enough, and now I need to get dressed and buy or order more food.",

We didn't wait long to meet our waiter who was friendly,funny  and checked up on us frequently. The bread was hot, fresh and delicious. They gave us a good amount of time to place our order and our food came quick. The appetizer we ordered was spinach artichoke dish which was delicious and plenty. We were pretty much stuffed from the dip plate and the bread. My son had the kids mac n cheese and says the cheesiness was just right, he liked that it was not yellow. He also like that he got several refills on his sprite and if this review was up to just him he would give it a 5 star rating.  My daughter had the kids spaghetti and one meatball. She claims the meatball crust was too hard and the noodles were too thick but the sauce was good and the meatball was flavorful. She also would rather have another meatball and less noodles. Daddy had the steak Dianne. He ordered it medium well but it came out medium rare but was ok with it because of the quality if the steak. The mashed potatoes was plentiful and really yummy. Some of the mushrooms were burnt but it did not mess up the taste. This dish had less sauce this time than it usually does but all the flavors were still there.  I had the chicken picatta. The noodles were aldente. The dish was very flavorful but very light on the stomach as well. We were anxious to get to dessert and share a raspberry type cheesecake but our stomachs got full too quick. Our waiter was quick to come back with the check and To go boxes. The bathrooms were clean and well supplied. This restaurant is on our list for our special occasion spots.",

Took us forever to order because we were so excited by the reunion.  He did not let us feel like we were being a pain in the ass (which I am sure we were.)    The Vietnamese spring rolls were very good.  The sauces it came with were awesome.  Our party had flatbread which was great.  Our relative had ahi tar tare which was fresh and flavorful.   The waiter was very tolerant of the fact that we sat and talked long after our meal was over.  Granted we came in at 1 P.M. and they weren't that busy but if I was a waiter I would have been thinking \"jeez people, are you moving in?\"  I thought we would never get the bill and then discovered my son-in-law had paid during his trip to the rest room.  He's a good boy!",

I never have an issue with customer service, the waiters or the management here. food portions are HUGEEEE. It's definitely filling. Must try the cheesecakes. My favorite dish from cheesecake factory is \"Louisiana chicken pasta\" very authentic taste.  I love the Godiva chocolate cheesecake from here. Great place great atmosphere great customer service great food. Overall awesome.",

You could have your pick from so many different cuisines from American, to Italian, to Chinese, and so on. There is always something for everyone, and they have insanely huge portions. This makes it so you always have some left over for later that day and the next day.   It's always important to save room for the cheesecake though. My personal favorite is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. It doesn't get much more satisfying than that.  I know this is a really short review, but the food is excellent, the service is top notch, and the ambiance is fantastic. The only thing that would negatively affect my review is the wait to get a table. If you come on a weekend night, expect to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to half an hour to be seated.",

We were told that it woudl take 15 minutes - even though half of the restaurant was empty.  It was 2:25 pm and we were still waiting to be seated.  My friend brought this event to the Manager.  He looked at us and said nothing!!  We waited for the waiter longer than usual.  We placed our order.  The salad was supposed to have the dressing on the side.  We waited 20 minutes for the dressing to be brought to our table.  The table was not cleaned before they brought the desert!  I have to say that, in general, CCF service was below standards.  Hope that this is not the new normal for CCF!",

The menu is large and some of that isn't great, but a few things I do like. This visit the BF and I shared the chicken and biscuit. The menu is huge and this was more than enough of a hearty dish to share. We each had a heap of mash potato, a filet of chicken, roasted carrots and a biscuit each. It was actually pretty good....think of a chicken pot pie, deconstructed with biscuits.   Really, I just wanted some cheesecake. I don't like any of the rich flavored ones they do as they are way too sweet and dense. I like the mango key lime which the tartness is nice with the creaminess and we also got a raspberry one which was decent, but the mango key lime was still better.   The service was friendly and pretty decent with refills. She brought us some warm bread and also had the kitchen split our meal into 2 plates.    I rarely go, because why when we have so many options here, but sometimes you just need to Cheesecake.",

We stayed because that didn't seem unreasonable. 50 minutes had gone by and we went to check to see how much longer as my kids were getting restless. The hostess advised that they were cleaning our table and said it would be about 10 more minutes. 20 more minutes passed and we observed a family who we thought came after us get seated. We inquired with the hostess again and was told that WE had only been waiting for an hour and that family had been waiting for an hour and 15 minutes. The hostess was snobby and dismissive about it. Not to mention she had just told us we would be seated in 10 minutes, 20 minutes prior. We were finally sat by another unpleasant hostess who was pregnant so I figured I'd give her a  pass for her behavior but seriously? If we hadn't already waited over an hour to eat I probably would have just left. If we had been informed that the wait was over an hour in the first place then we could have made the decision to stay that long and wait. I will not return to this location.",

This place wasn't busy and we waited 15 minutes to be seated and the hostess mispronounced my name! GRRRR, my name is TEDDI, how difficult is this? I need to make this short and sweet or I could ramble on and on! The hostess, Budweiser in the bottle (they forgot the chilled glass as promised) and the water in a plastic glass was the BEST of the experience, oh and the manager that came to tell us that the cook burned the cheeseburger (Kenton ordered a classic burger so he was corrected, how embarrassing ). It took us over 45 minutes to receive our meal because the cook needed to remake Kenton's burger while my omelet sat on the warmer. By the time we finally received our food, my omelet was burned on the edges and the bacon on the inside was charred and the cheeses weren't melted, no butter with the English muffin which was also burnt as well as the side of potatoes! Listen, I am not one to complain but when you spend $62.95 on food that we didn't enjoy or finish and have to still tip and ask for water, that is ridiculous! I will NEVER return. The hostess' biggest mistake was to ask me how we enjoyed everything and all I could do was shake my head and compliment her on her outgoing personality (in spite of her mispronouncing my name)! So eat at your own risk!",

I love that CF has such a large menu selection and I noticed that they expanded their menu too! So there's something for everyone.  Since my few last visits at CF here and in LA... I've been a fan of their miso salmon! If you like fish you have to try it!  Great customer service and I love that they have outdoor seating.  I'm a fan.",

    "text": "Update 7/25/16....I am pleased that the manager, James, has taken responsibility for what happened. I will go back and give them another chance. As I said, the food was delicious and I love their cheesecake.  He admitted that there was a failure on many levels and is taking steps to address them all. Taking responsibility and taking action is all I can ask. Raising to 3 stars for all the reasons I listed.  UPDATE: 7/18/16..I MISSED A CALL FROM THE MANAGER, JAMES, AND WHEN I CALLED BACK AT 5:59 PM I WAS PUT ON HOLD FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE 3RD PERSON TO HANDLE MY CALL TOLD ME HE LEFT 15 MIN AGO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? HOW DID THE 1ST PERSON PUT ME ON HOLD FOR 6 MINUTES IF HE WAS ALREADY GONE? I CAN'T EVEN STAND BY 2 STARS. THEY GET 1 STAR FOR THE FOOD BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT IS HORRIBLE!  I ordered a to-go order on the phone and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I got there about 17 minutes after my call. I stood for a good 5-10 minutes just waiting for help. When someone finally appeared she pulled up my order and gave me the total and then got told by someone else behind the counter that the person standing next to me was waiting first. That person was standing there when I got there and was only waiting on a cheesecake to go. Not a complicated order (didn't require the kitchen) and she had to have been waiting at least 15-20 minutes.  My order took about 30 minutes. I ordered a burrito with extra sour cream and guacamole so when they showed me a container with visible sour cream I figured that was the extra. When I got home, however, it turns out the there was NO sour cream or guacamole on or around the burrito. The \"extra\" I ordered was less than what would have come with the burrito let alone constitute anything near the \"extra\" I paid for. There was no guacamole at all with or for the burrito. The food is good (why I gave 2 stars) but the service was absolutely horrible!",

My family and I were in the area so we decided to get our cheesecake fix at this location. I asked my husband to go in with our son to purchase our cheesecakes while our daughter and I stay in the car. When he came back he told me that the cashier \"Diana\" had charged him the third slice at regular price because there was only two of them in the restaurant, but she didn't tell him ahead of time that there was a limit of one per customer. Last year I was able to purchase three cheesecakes by myself at another location. Anyway, it would've been fine if he could only purchase the two at half-off, but this cashier should've informed him if they had a limit so he didn't have to go through the trouble of returning it. Such poor customer service. And he even left tip in her empty tip jar! But just now after reading the others reviews from the past month, I guess I shouldn't be surprised of this location's very poor customer service. Needless to say, we won't be going back to this location.",

We tried to speak with the manager but he was too busy to come talk to us. We tried to make a booster seat work but it was our granddaughters first time in one so she was having a hard time trying it out. Then they started seating more customers right next to us so instead of disrupting the people around us we decided to leave. We stopped by the hostess stand to try to talk to the manager one more time but he was still too busy to talk to us. We walked down the way to Kona Grill and are having a pleasant experience with a high chair.",

Firstly my boyfriend and I were clearly ahead of two other groups of two who were seated before us. We had a show to attend after and budgeted two hours for dinner so we asked for first available seating knowing it would be on the patio. The table we were seated at was filthy and there were leaves in my table setting. The server was manic and obviously under trained and over worked. Long story short drinks (not from the bar) took 15 minutes to get to our table, we had to ask for a sugar caddy 4 times, and we didn't see our entrees until 50 minutes later. The manager was condescending when he brought our food because of the obvious disaster. He stated that he thought we had only been waiting 24 minutes! Basically calling my boyfriend a liar. We do know exactly how long it took because we went through two Pokemon Go incense packs and a lure waiting for our meal. The only good part of this dining experience was having the time to sit and talk uninterrupted because our server didn't seem to be bothered to check up on us.",

My goto favorites are as follows: Appetizers: I order the Thai Lettuce Wraps for lunch it comes out beautiful on a huge plate!  I can literally drink the tamarind cashew sauce! Salad: I LOVE the chopped salad. Their balsamic vinegarette is yummy.  Pasta: I have two favorites here, the Bistro Shrimp and the Louisiana chicken. Specialty: the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp omg orange saucy goodness!!!  Fish: You CAN NOT go wrong with the Miso salmon oooommmmmgggg Dessert: brownie sundae cheesecake mmmm I've ordered all of those items a few times! There are tons of options and they seem to do them all well!  Now back to my star prob. The service is more often lackluster then great. I might expect awesome service buuuut when you come to my table and say \"what would you like to drink\" it's just rude..... How about \"Hi! I'm so and so\"??? The food is awesome, the service blah.

    "text": "Cheesecake factory, one of my favorite spots and very popular among my friends.   This time around was last thursday 12/12/13 and our server was Shawn M. dinner time  we had a good size group about 12 people total. They sat us with 8 because the rest of our group would take some time.  Starting with the food. I am an impulse kind of guy, i like to try new things but don't like deciding. This time i actually saw a picture of the dish i got on a screen above the bakery counter. I got the steak Diane. med rare super tender and flavorfull. with potatoes. I also tried some of the caesar salad. Both amazing and up to par for cheesecake factory.  We got sat and we were starving. our waiter came over explained the specials as they usually do. We were very thirsty and asked for water. He claimed he was not taking drinks right now he will just explain the specials and come back in a few minutes. Something im not really used to hearing as we all just wanted water. I am myself a server so i tried to be understanding. When he did come back a few minutes later. we gave our drink orders mostly water. My girl said we ready to order too when you are. He explained \"ok well im just gonna take the drinks now until the rest of your group gets here give me a minute\". The tone was very unfriendly to me and my entire group. It was obvious he knew we were a gratuity table and since we were young did not care to go above and beyond to get the little extra that cheesecake servers usually give. At this point i started to pay attention to him. Noticing which tables he was responsible for, how many were seated etc etc. this just justified the fact that yes we were a gratuity table of kids to him and so he did not care as much as he did his other tables. When he came back i decided to speak up as the rest of my group were kinda annoyed. I explained clear we are ready to order when you are, the rest of our group will not be here for awhile. This is after about 15 minutes of us being seated already. an estimate of about 35 minutes until we finally started receiving our food. Not ideal but nothing we could do at this point. My water specifically was refilled only twice, i drink a lot of water, and less than half way through my meal i was done. and didn't get a refill until i was done with my meal. Then once more AFTER i received my split check at which point i no longer needed a refill.  Order taken food arriving and the rest of our group showed up.   this part annoyed me the most, he explained to our friends that just arrived \"yeah they didn't wait for you guys so let me know when your ready to order\". Little does this server know we explained that to them already and they are the ones who told us to order because they would not be there for awhile.  This is something i am not used to at cheesecake factory. This particular server definitely did not start us off right. i am sure that the rest of my group might not understand why. But as a management myself i know when a server notices a young gratuity table and does not care to meet minimum standards of service. We were his only large table and from what i could see he was not so overwhelmed that he could not care to give us the service he was giving others. Where as his smaller tables got lots of time and attention.  Night ended and he put us all on one check. Someone asked to have it split and he did so. Thing was he knew pretty much exactly what everyone had. The time it took for him to bring us the split checks, and cash us out was definitely inattentive. We were actually trying to meet our next destination at a certain time but ended up not going because we were waiting for him to cash out our checks. We got the first check at 22:13 and my check personally was not checked out till about 22:33 per my receipts.   with this series of bad events and lack of care for a young gratuity table. that is why 3 stars.  My only advice is if you have a large group try your best not to have this server.   automatic gratuity is necessary but should never be an excuse for poor service at a restaurant known for service.",

The last time I came in was only for a slice of cheesecake and I was waiting for over 20 minutes! I don't think it takes that long to slice a piece of cheesecake now does it? I asked for a manager just to inform him of the situation and he was very apologetic and made sure I got a cheesecake (comped) to-go. That was nice considering I had waiting so long for it! For today's visit, a friend and I were waiting nearly 10-12 minutes just for the server to come and take our drink order! It's a little ridiculous but the food is so good I can't stop coming back! :)",

You just have to know going in that it will be busy, there will be a wait, and you will most likely not get a booth but those horrible small tables that are shoved next to each other and then you are eating with strangers. I hate that.  Tiramisu cheesecake is my favorite.",

    "text": "5 stars for their White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake!  3 stars for the service and 3 stars for the food on a Friday lunch with no lunch rush. The service seemed to die down once we ordered our food and we had to wait a good 15 minutes after we finished eating to find the server to get us a box. (Maybe there was a lunch rush and I was not aware of it.) For an appetizer we ordered the Crispy Cheese Sticks. It was crispy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. This is definitely worth trying and getting for next time. I generally like the Cheesecake Factory and since I'm boring and set in my ways, I normally order the Bistro Shrimp Pasta or the Miso Salmon. I decided on the Miso Salmon, because they did not offer a lunch portion of the Bistro Shrimp. The salmon looked a lil overcooked with its blackened edges and as I took a bite, it was a lil dry. The flavor was not what I remembered, but maybe it's because I normally get it with the mashed potatoes instead of the white rice. Anyhow, I was disappointed with my lunch. My sister ordered the kids cheese pizza. It was probably about a 10incher and very cheesy. She said it was good, but had a funny taste. I think overall, I was disappointed with the quality of the entrees but maybe they just had an off day. I will definitely be returning for some yummy cheesecake though!",

She picks Cheesecake Factory.  Short wait as we opted to sit outside under the heat lamps. We're one of three parties who braved the chilly night but it wasn't too cold that we were miserable.   The service was awesome. I don't remember his name but it's guys like our server that make dining experiences memorable.   My friend had a Kobe burger that was cooked just as she ordered it. The cooks even cut it in half for her as per her request.   I opted for the Salisbury Steak which was so good that my friend had a few bites. The mashed potatoes complimented the entree and both meals came out piping hot.   Parking seems like it can be trying but we lucked out right away.",

Anyways, another 15 minutes after that (40 minutes in total) we get seated.   The waitress was nice and processed our orders quickly and efficiently. HOWEVER! The food was meh, to say the least. The bread was good as usual, but everything else was bland. I got the Renee's Special, which is a soup/sandwich/salad combo. I try to eat relatively healthy (lots of protein, no additives) so restaurant food is usually a flavor overload. Nope! The tortilla soup tasted like lukewarm salty water. My sandwich was OK tasting but the bread was so hard I had to break away the top layer to even bite through it! For 11 bucks I can get a better combo at Subway. I'm disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory!",

With that said, we waited entirely too long in between courses with items getting left behind. I ordered a soup for dinner and mine was last to come out after people got steak. Then we had one person order dessert, when the dessert came rhe waiter came back and asked if we wanted anymore dessert. We said no again and waited another 10 minutes for him to bring the check. This is not only horrible for a guest whose dinner normally would take no longer than an hour but for the business as their turn over time is much higher allowing less opportunity for guests to come in. Longer wait times both at the table and in line equals less return customers. Overall the food was great and the Georgia peach beverage was refreshing.",

We were there for over 1.5 hours as our food took 40 minutes to see.  It was a monday afternoon. They sat a lady next to the 3 of us 15 minutes after we ordered and she received her food before we did. Terrible. When I finally got my entre it looked good... The mashed potatoes were great. A bit dry after a minute but at first delicious. The chicken although tasted like they had taken an entire lemon and just squirted it on top. Eek. My eyes were twitching.  So I asked the server to please exchange it for the creamy fried herb  lemon chicken my friend had. It's an 18$ dish. It doesnt seem too expensive at first. But when you receive it the chicken is pounded very thin. The outside is not crunchy like you would hope for from breaded chicken. It's nothing more than a large chicken nugget. Tuna appetizer was very small and not the best. The potstickers were just ok. In my opinion it was mediocre. And not worth $120.",

A friend and I had lunch there Super Bowl Sunday and were excited to enjoy the game. She ordered a salad and I ordered the Pasta Napoletana....BIG MISTAKE! I enjoyed the meal only to get home and suffer a night of hell!! The undercooked pork sent me to the bathroom where I remained for hours, throwing up and ultimately becoming completely dehydrated.  In an effort to make management aware, I called the Rampart location and spoke to the manager. Right away, I knew this was a very young and inexperienced person, he was defensive and said that I was the only person to complain. This child concluded the conversation by stating that the Corporate Office would contact me. That was days ago..... I'm not holding my breath.  The most frustrating part is that my call to the restaurant WAS NOT to complain, but to give management a heads up so that they could check their ingredients and mention this incident to staff in the hopes of preventing a reoccurrence. They basically blew me off, so they clearly don't give a damn about your health either. Word to the wise..... you've been warned.",

Let's start with my little brother's girlfriends graduation dinner from UNLV. A party of 8, service was good, the server was attentive and had everything going for her when it came to her tables.  The food, well, how can you mess up a burger medium? It can be done, and I was done this night.  As they were swamped, I knew better than to ask for a remake, it would have taken them one hour for a burger.  No worries the dessert made up for the crappy food.   Now today, 6/18, as it was not my choice to go, I went back because my brother's girlfriend loves it there. Issac was our server, really good server, but the length of time to get two basic meals was not good. I did not order as I got there late, and my brother was waiting 1 hour for tacos and some other quick making food.  The patrons to the side of us, who came in after him and right before I,  received their food beforehand. As both my brother and I come from a hospitality owned establishment, this is not what we excepted.  This is not the normal Cheesecake Factory expectations, at least from the east coast. I know I will not be returning to this one ever again. Furthermore, I will make sure no one visits this one when they come to visit.",

I handed our waiter, David N., the letter which still had the gift card attached to it (you guys sent us a $45 gift card to give you another try). In the letter it states that the manager would like to know we are there and they could make sure our experience was a better one and would like to meet us. This did not happen, the waiter stood there and read the letter so I don't know if it was waiter who did not inform management or they just didn't want to come out, but we were never approached by any manager.   We ordered the eggroll sampler and it was just put in front of us with no explanation of the sauces (never have we ordered any of the eggrolls). We had to go back through the menu to read the individual eggroll descriptions to try and figure this out the sauces but I still don't think we got it right. Now, of course this isn't the biggest deal so we just let it go.  My friend ordered the grilled fish tacos with no marinated onions and instead cooked onions with no chipotle sauce (she's very sensitive to heat) and to have that replaced with your creama (from the \"slim\" menu). She received her dinner and there was no creama, just chipIotle sauce, a very minimal amount of grilled onions (a taco had ONE small strip) ZERO avocado (as it states on the menu its served with it)  and somehow there was a pickled cabbage?? (it's not stated thats on the tacos on the menu) We asked the server if they could remake it and at this point we are getting very frustrated with the service and food. I had to ask for my coke and her water to be refilled MANY times despite the waiter always walking around. I was genuinely flabbergasted I had to ask for refills with how much he was walking by.  So, by now, after already a long wait to receive our food to begin with (the restaurant was not busy by any means from what we could tell) we had to wait another 15 minutes for her food to be remade, so my boyfriend and I stopped eating out of courtesy.  45 mins after we ordered our food, we FINALLY got to eat together and of course my boyfriends and I's dinner was cold. My friend STILL then had a problem with her order (the tortillas were not cooked) but by then we were so hungry we didnt say anything.  Now, here comes the time to pay. After the waiter took the $45 gift card off the total, the remaining balance of the bill was $42 and change. I only had twenties and my friend had her debit card. So, we told the waiter for $20.00 on the card and I put down two twenty dollar bills. David, our waiter, brought back the receipts with no change! Never EVER had I had a waiter just assume the remaining change was theirs and pocket my cash. He never asked if we needed change to verify it was his, he just took it! I asked for it back and he mumbled an apology about be busy or whatnot (which none of us believed, he was making excuses all night and the place WASN'T busy).  For this trying to be a make-up from last time for the burnt food and bad food, you guys SERIOUSLY missed again. I don't know if it's this location or whatever but we are very unsatisfied with the service and food and that the manager wasn't around to make sure our dining experience was better than the last. I really enjoyed you guys, but at this rate my friend says she NEVER wants to come back and I don't blame her!!!",

The veggie burger was AMAZING, exactly as he described. He was extremely attentive and made sure we knew our food would be right out. He checked on us multiple times, making sure our cups were full at all times! He was most definitely the most attentive, assuring & helpful waiter we have ever encountered!",

What is that? What was in there? Buffalo marinated chicken with cheese inside of fried wonton wrappers. Do not underestimate these fried wonton wrappers...sounds strange, but you won't even know that they're wonton wrappers while you're eating them. The blue cheese sauce and buffalo sauce on the side is AWESOOOOOOOOOME.   My other fave item is their Godiva brownie sundae. This will be sure to hit the spot if you're craving major sweets.   Let's not forget the complimentary brown and sourdough bread. ME LOOOOOVES!!!   Service was on point. Location is nice, but interior is much smaller than other Cheesecakes I've gone to.   I\"ll be back to stuff my face with some more buffalo blasts...after I manage to get a workout aka walk 1 mile.",

Went in at 2:30 pm on a Tuesday and it was pretty dead. Only problem is, they only seemed to have one waitress taking care of all six tables at once. She was sweet and trying her best. Booth behind us had issues with their lettuce and booth in front of us sent back their steak. By the time our food came out, a good 35 mins into being there. my baby's mashed potatoes were very cold and my husband's chicken and mashed potatoes were also cold. Obviously none of that was the waitress job but the kitchen obviously was making her life hard. We felt bad for her so I didn't complain but needless to say, nearly an hour and a half we finally got out of there (luckily before a toddler melt down) on a dead Tuesday afternoon. I would hate to see this location during peak times. But seriously, if you are going to have prices in this range and super slow service please serve me warm food!",

If it was this bad for a Wednesday, I hate to imagine what it's like on a weekend. Our server, Daniel, meant well (and kept mentioning how hard he was working and how fast he was walking), but a meal should only take 2 hours when the guest wants it to. We waited for bread, we waited for water and were only refilled once, we waited for boxes, we waited for cake, we waited for boxes for the cake, we waited for the check, it was a lot of waiting. We basically had to bus our own table numerous times, meanwhile noticing many servers and bussers standing around chatting with one another.  I could understand if everyone was busy, but it seemed like Daniel was the only one running ragged. Other tables around us were bussed and other servers were walking leisurely and checking on their tables regularly. Not sure if it's a Daniel issue (he did apologize, but too little too late) or a CF issue, but something is off here.",

Since we were starved already, we opted to go inside and order our food to go, however, I wanted to be sure the manager was aware of what had happened. Jason came out to meet me and as soon as I explained the situation, he heartily apologized. I had no expectations at all in trying to gain anything but being heard, yet he def took care of us.

Mind you the lettuce was halfway in his mouth, luckily the bug fell off before he consumed the whole thing. He literally spit his food out, and I did the same. He took all our food back - and the manager tells my husband \"well there was a bug in your food because it's humid outside\". For crying out loud there is NO excuse for live bugs to be in anyone's food!!!  He offered a cheesecake which of course my husbanded declined. Several years later we tried takeout again from this location. Don't ask why, because honestly I have no idea why. We should've learned our lesson the first time right?  Well my poor husband again had another horrible situation. As he bit into his turkey burger it was completely raw!!!!!  That was the last time we've ever been to Cheesecake Factory. And mind you the kids pasta was awful. Felt like they took the noodles out of the box and threw some butter on top and didn't bother cooking the noodles.

    "text": "I would like to start off by saying that I have paid multiple visits to cheesecake factory before. The food is diverse and made right most of the time but my visit tonight will be my last. Being a server myself, I understand that it can be complicated in the kitchen but a bad attitude from a server (whose name I don't know since she never bothered to introduce herself), is not acceptable. We started off with the portabella mushroom avocado and zucchini fries which is a staple for us and it was served different than other times but we've become accustomed to getting this dish looking different each time. We also ordered the tostada salad to share. Three iced tea refills later (one of which was the wrong kind of tea), and I had to ask the waitress where our salad was and she informed us that they burnt the tostada and were making a new one. Fifteen minutes later we get the salad which looked more like a bowl of lettuce with nothing else mixed in it. It was clearly missing some of the ingredients. The manager came around and offered to replace the salad with a new one made correctly. After three tries, we were served a simple salad that should've been on the table an hour before. I did my best to be understanding towards the server until she dropped the check off with three salads on there and she had only taken off one of them from the total. Basically they expected me to pay for THEIR mistake. At that point, I had given up on the server and once again asked to see a manager and all he did was take one more salad off and have me pay for the bill as if it was served right at a reasonable time. He never bothered to apologize or try and make up for the inconvenience. Over all it was not a good experience. People do not come to a restaurant to wait around and be treated this way. Restaurants are equally valued for their customer service as they are for their food in my eyes and cheesecake factory failed at both this time. Considering the way management acts around here, I do not think there will be a change made in this restaurant's ways. I won't be back.",

I understand it was a busy day for them, so we gave her extra time, but it took her way too long to get our drinks. I had to ask for my water 3 times before I got it. At the end of the night she charged us an 18% gratuity that was supposed to be discretionary. She didn't even ask us! She just charged me! The manager we spoke to was extremely nice and helpful. He said that she wasn't supposed to do that, and took the gratuity off of our check. If I go next time I hope our service during our dinner will be better.",

It was 10:30pm (they close at 11pm) and I pulled into Cheesecake Factory.   We were sat at a nice table and they gave us a full menu and offered to bring out bread.  We told them we were only having dessert. (but nice to know that they continue serving the full menu until close!)  My mom picked the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake and I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cheesecake.  I found the waiter and let him know that it was my mom's birthday.  They came out with \"Happy Birthday Lisa\" written on the plate in chocolate, a candle and sang \"Happy Birthday To You\".  It was very nicely done!  The cheesecake was delicious (took some home for later!).  The service was great- he refilled our water and decaf coffee very promptly.  I will definitely go here again just for dessert!",

    "text": "On special occasions, I like to treat my better half to the Cheesecake Factory!  Our absolute favorite dish is the \"bang bang chicken and shrimp.\"  It consists of a mound of rice, surrounded by mild curry with chicken and shrimp sieging  the mound.  You could easily order one serving and share between the two of you, but it is so good that we order one each!  It makes for a good leftover lunch the next day.  The service is absolutely amazing.  The last time we went, had a waiter named Marty and he took care of us and went out of his way to make sure that we were had a great time.  I recommend getting the strawberry lemonade.  A bottomless glass of bursting flavor is what you will get.  Highly addictive and now that I am writing this review, I long for another.  You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory without taking advantage of its namesake!  Our choices for desert are:  - The Banana Cream Cheesecake - White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake  I highly recommend this place!",

The parking situation here is terrible but once inside we slid up to the bar area and enjoyed a great lunch. The service was prompt and friendly even during their busy lunch rush and my water glass never ran empty; which is a big deal to me. We split the chopped salad from the \"skinny\" menu as well as a sausage flat bread and both were delicious. The chopped salad is huge and was more than enough for both of us and the sausage on the flat bread had great flavor. I will certainly be keeping this place in mind for further meals.",

Our server, Jessica was took our drink order shortly after we sat down.  I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and Chicken combo.  I wanted to try something new and I thought it was a great choice.  I loved the appearance of the plate and the food was outstanding.  I didn't like the mango salsa though.  My wife loves this dish and raves about the salsa.  For me, I the salsa didn't work but everything else did.  The bean and rice were good especially when I mixed it with the chicken and shrimp.  Overall, I give this place four stars...the staff were friendly and checked with us several times during our visit.  If I visit this area in Las Vegas again, I would consider visiting this establishment again.  Oh and the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake is to die for.  What a way to end an evening.",

It was 10 minutes before we got water, another 10 before our order for apps was taken.  We ordered the crispy taquitos to start with.  Tasty but the guacamole was so skimpy-not enough for 2 people to have a decent dab.  The hubby ordered the Ribbed Eye (at CF? Really???). It was overcooked but service was so spotty that night that we were afraid to send it back.  it came with fries...The fries are different and not for the better.  I ordered the stuffed chicken tortilla.  It was still as good as I remembered.  CF still has the best Ranch dressing.  We ordered cheesecake to go.  My husband got the Coconut cream which he said was \"fine\".  I tried the Pineapple upside down cake.  It was just okay but that isn't a quality issue-just a matter of taste.  Like most of the chains restaurants, it is easy to see that they have skimped here & there to make their profit.  I would rather they be honest-either keep the quality with smaller proportions or charge more.   Can't give them an A-ok because for the price it was a huge disappointment and it seems the last few times we have gone, our experience gets just a little bit worse...",

No points lost there however, as some people enjoy crusty bread like that.

We ordered banana cream cheesecake and chocolate tuxedo cheesecake to go so I won't know how they are until later.  All in all a good experience.

    "text": "Ordered our favorite Cheesecake Factory meals to go after a long day at work. But again, the meal wasn't complete. I ordered the blackened salmon with broccolli and mashed potatoes. But what I got was salmon and broccolli, no potatoes. I called the restaurant and talked to the manager, she took all my information and looked up the order then proceeded to tell me that she will send it to corporate and if they think they need to do something about it they will send me information. NOTHING, never heard from anyone. And although I really like Cheesecake Factory, take out is over. They clearly can't get their act together to put the food in the container. But the total lack of management customer service is unexcuseable. So I took a photo of the container and waited.  Maybe because two orders prior they again left and entire meal off the order and I called to let them know, I must be blackballed in a book at the managers desk.  Regardless of the couple of dozens of times we order over the course of a year doesn't matter. She treated me like I was not telling the truth.",

    "text": "Cheesecake is in the name, so you know it will be good!  This is a great restaurant chain.  This location is huge with seating both inside and out.  They have the usual 30 page menu, so you will definitely find at least 1 thing, if not 10 that you want to try for lunch/dinner.    The food tastes great as well.  My favorites are all appetizers.  I usually get 2 apps and enjoy a small feast.  My absolute favorites are the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, and the Buffalo Wontons.   All are winners and I recommend these to everyone who loves yumminess on a plate.  If you are in need of more food than some appetizers, you are in luck! They have everything from tasty pizzas, yummy sandwiches, and delicious entrees that could feed a small village.  If you can name it, Cheesecake Factory probably has it on their menu.  The desserts are fantastic here too!  I mean cheesecake is in the name of the place, so you know the cheesecake will be great!  The also have other desserts like cake and pie, but I have never tried them because I always go for cheesecake! DUH!  My favorite choices are the Chocolate Tuxedo, Dulce de Leche, and Key Lime cheesecake.  The Pumpkin cheesecake is fabulous, but you can only get that one in the fall.  The service is usually great and you can usually be sat pretty quickly, due to the massive amount of tables available.  It is a very consistent restaurant.  It seems no matter when you go, the food will always be the same.  They run this place like a well oiled machine and it is a great place to eat.",

    "text": "this was my first experience at the Cheesecake Factory in all it's existence.  my cousin had her 15th birthday dinner here and my first impression... BUSY! [Which didn't shock me.. because every time I come across a Cheesecake Factory, it always seems to be busy!]  anyway, it's a nice looking place in a nice area with plenty of parking and seats to sit down outside because it's always obviously busy.    we were seated within the 20 minute time frame that they gave us.. which was understandable because we were a big party.  it is a shopping mall so there's a little bit of window shops to look at while you wait.    we were finally seated and it seemed well kept... and for how busy it seemed it's a pretty good job they do of keeping this place up.   It's a large restaurant with lots of seating and lots of patrons.  Idk, I'm not big on the large crowds and large places so I guess that's why this review pretty much sucks.  anyway, the menu is LARGE.  I use the word overwhelming a lot, but this menu is truly overwhelming.  there's like.. 2,000 things on this menu.  luckily everything had a description.  so I had the Factory Burrito Grande.  nothing special about it... typical.  only it was huge.... like the size of a baby huge.   the cheesecake I have to admit was really good.  they were huge pieces and the waiter let us know that so we didn't go all out and order 1 slice per person.   the slice was seriously good enough for 4 people.  they were huge... but very good.   eh... it's not a first choice for me.  i like small dives and secrets.  i don't know.. it was just alright. sorry.  again, this review sucks and i don't care cause i don't think i'll ever take a drive to this place ever again anyway.  so thanks for the baby burrito.",

We each ordered different things. My husband ordered the fish and chips. About 8 hours later in the middle of the night (and not having eaten anything else), he was extremely and violently sick. Sick for 2 and a half days, in fact. There is no way I will ever go near the place again. This time I've learned my lesson.",

We had the grilled artichoke this was very good , had a nice grilled flavor to it , unlike some places that say they grill ,but you cant' tell. We also had the stuffed mushrooms from the tapas menu. It was stuffed with fontina cheese and garlic, topped with parm cheese in a wine sauce.                  For my main course I had the cobb salad it comes w/ a balsamic dressing but i chose to have it with ranch. This was the dinner portion it was huge. It was full of bacon , boiled eggs , chicken  ,blue cheese and topped with  a half an avocado. This was more like a chopped salad which  I prefer.. Everything was chopped into small pieces except  the chix which was sliced, and it was full of chix. I joked to my wife that they put a whole chix in the salad , she had the same thing and hers was full of chix too.              We also had the low carb cheesecake with a walnut crust , yummy.   Service was a little slow but i don't blame the server she ran her butt off , it seemed they were under staffed. It was very busy.",

My friend ordered the tuxedo cheesecake and we shared.. It was good. For the appetizers, we ate nachos and chips (platter size) and other stuff. One of the girls ordered personal pansize pizzas for her grandbabies. We were thinking that they were maybe four pieces like Pizza Hut...Boy were we wrong. It was more like ten pieces.

We went for lunch on a weekday, and the entire meal took an hour and a half (some of us work and and some point need to go back!)  There were other tables that arrived and ordered after us, but ate and left before us, even though we had the same server.   Two of us in the group ordered a lunch salad and sandwich combo, but  substituted for an upgraded salad.  While the server said there \"might be a small up-charge\" for the difference, she ending up charging us an additional entree charge ($11) because she said that the difference for the two salads equals one entree so it was just easier for her to put in on the check that way.  WTF?  I've never heard of anything like that, and charging half the cost of an additional entree for a salad up-charge is ridiculous.  The customer service at this CF is non-existent.  I'm  giving two stars because the food is good, even though the employees are sub-par.",

I was sitting near the window watching a dream of ants walk along the window seal.    Then we returned on a holiday and it was busy.   We were seated at a table that had food still underneath and on the seats.   They cleaned the seats after we asked, but my feet were trying to find a space in between what was on the floor.  Last night my menu was wet and sticky.   Like there was a quick half hearted wipe with a rag.   For desert we ordered the fresh strawberries.   They looked dead.   We basically just stopped eating them because why?   The strawberries at home in my fridge that I bought three days ago were much fresher.   They just seem too busy to keep up and handle the crowd that comes there.",

    "text": "The Cheesecake Factory is much more than cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that specializes in burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and pizza.     Yesterday after hanging out in Sabalatte in the Boca Park Fashion Village, my brother and I were up for dinner. We decided on The Cheesecake Factory. The menu offers a diverse selection of food at competitive prices inside an upscale dining room. We couldn't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.     Although I have only been to this location once before way back in February of 2005 when I picked up my new Saturn Ion (sure was a long time ago), and celebrated with a delicious pasta dinner, I am no stranger to the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the Caesar's Palace location quite a few times.     When my brother and I stepped inside the dimly lit and elegant restaurant, it was understandably busy. The friendly hostess took our name and kindly let us know that there would be a five minute wait. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to implement the text messaging system that some restaurants have incorporated. The wait was less than five minutes.     Tina was our waitress. She was friendly, never rushed us, and constantly checked up on us. I am giving a shout out for Tina on account of the fact that my brother left his sunglasses at the table. As we approached the Valley parking area (on the way to the upper deck), Tina comes running after us with his sunglasses. With that said, the service here rounded up Cheesecake Factory to four stars.     The food is also delicious. Everytime that I have dined in a Cheesecake Factory, the large portions had filled me up leaving me with no room for cheesecake. In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant for either dinner or coffee and dessert. We just had coffee at Sabalatte, so tonight I ordered their chicken parmesan sandwich which included fries and a Coke. The chicken parmesan sandwich is unique. I don't know of many restaurants that make it. Plus, it is delicious. Between the time of ordering and Tina delivering the sandwich, she delivered the customary dinner rolls. In past visits to the Caesar's Palace Cheesecake Factory, the pasta sauce was included.  Here, there is a separate bowl of the sauce where you pour it on to your liking. I enjoyed every bite of the chicken parmesan sandwich. It is something that I do not enjoy very often. I also enjoyed the small bowl of French fries that accompanied the sandwich. And the Coke did not have a hint of flatness. It was just as sparkling as Tina's attitude.     Cheesecake Factory was $20 well spent. The dining area is not Tiffany elegance but an elegance similar to dining in a Caesar's Palace, Venetian Hotel, or upscale resort Cafe. It is a dining environment that isolates the outside world and is simply relaxing. The food was delicious and filling. Service was outstanding. I could see another well spent $20 at Cheesecake Factory in the future. Or $30 if I am hungry and want to reward myself with their signature cheesecake and coffee.",

    "text": "One of the reasons why I love eating at Cheesecake Factory is because the menu has such a wide variety to choose from. It's perfect for when your with a group of people who all want different types of food or if you just don't know what you're hungry for. Everything on their menu is absolutely delicious.   This particular location is interesting because it's in Boca Park where a lot of the Summerlin snobs hang out.   Today was a beautiful sunny day so we opted to sit in the patio. Being that there was only 2 of us, and they weren't busy, we were seated right away. However I could tell, almost immediately, that this visit was going to be not a good as previous experiences. Our server, Shawn M, came over to us right away and said \"is everything okay over here?\" This was a very odd way to greet a couple who had literally just been seated. We replied yes. He asked if we were ready to order. We'd been there less than 5 min so we said no. We placed our drink orders and asked for a few more min to review the menu. This was a mistake! Almost 15 min went by before our waiter came back to take our order. We had even closed our menus hoping he'd see we were ready to order. He was attending to other tables right near us. He finally took our order. Another several min went by before someone brought bread to our table. As we ate the yummy bread and waited for our food, we caught wind of an unsatisfied couple right next to us. They seemed to be making quite a fit about some cucumbers and arugula being left off. The manager was at their table trying to smooth it over. Perhaps this is why the waiter in my area seemed off... Our food arrived finally. I ordered the mushroom burger with a salad. My bf ordered the chicken avocado club. Our food was very good. I got a side of ranch to dip my burger in and it was tasty. As we ate, the snobby couple next to us continued to be a pain. The manager ended up re-making their food to-go for them to make up for the mistake. The couple continued to sit at their table even after checking out. Awkward!! I was about half way through my food when they finally got up to leave. As they left I hear the girl say \"this is hysterical that they re-made our food!\" The Summerlin snobs left and mood quickly went from tense to peaceful.   In conclusion, my experience today was just alright. My server was inattentive and overall a bit off. The Summerlin snobs complaining only made it worse. I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory before and have had great service. This time not so much. If you choose to eat at this location, just beware of the Summerlin snobs. I warned you. If you have an issue with your order, please tell the waiter/waitress quietly otherwise it is unnecessarily disruptive to those around you. Don't be a Summerlin snob!",

We were seated after only a few minute wait which was great for a Friday night without reservations. I suggest a booth over a table which provides a buffer for the surrounding noise. The large room can be conversation challenging when filled with diners. Our server was friendly and attentive.  The food ordering and preparation were timely. The Crispy Chicken Costoletta consists of 3 breaded breasts sauteed and served with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. The 3 large breasts were tender and juicy with a crispy panko style breading. This was 1 meal for 2 people or 2 meals.  The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp was sauteed with a spicy pepper sauce.  The entree is served with a choice of white or brown rice, along with black beans, plantains, and a cool mango sauce. The plantains were crispy outside and soft on the inside. The generous portion of shrimps were moderately spicy but not overwhelming. The cool mango was a nice contrast to the spicy shrimp. The restaurant has a Happy Hour but be advised it is only in the bar area which at our arrival was at full capacity. The bar area is wide open and will be on the loud side.",

We came on a Monday night and were seated right away although there were larger parties ahead of us. I got the spicy cashew chicken and my bf got the carne asada steak medallions. Both were very good, especially the first bite of my spicy cashew chicken. It had strong flavorings but wasn't as spicy as the name. My server knew so he brought out chili peppers for me, which kinda helped! It was good but got kind of salty after a while so I decided to take it home for lunch the next day. We also wanted dessert and since the place is called Cheesecake Factory we opted for a slice of regular cheesecake. It was pretty sweet but eating it with the whipped cream given definitely complemented the taste! Overall, I would come back and maybe try the other dishes!",

They are amazing, filled with crab, green onions and of course, cream cheese. Although they are deep fried, the sweet chili sauce on the side makes them irresistible. Bread service is always great. We usually only ask for the wheat bread with butter, but we were introduced to the white bread with olive oil. AMAZING. The fiance had a flat bread with dollops of ricotta, and I had a Caesar salad with my favorite carbonara pasta! Desert was missed because we were so stuffed but our waiter Sean was absolutely amazing. Our drinks were never refilled but his personality was excellent. He remembered everything we told him without having to write it all down in a book like most people do. That was pretty impressive because we are pretty picky.",

My boyfriend surprised me, taking me here, but because he dislikes coconut and I swore that the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake would change his mind, he was willing to taste it. 4 stars because seriously TAKE RESERVATIONS. AT LEAST DO A RESERVE WAIT LIST for people who are courteous enough to call ahead. On a Friday night at peak hours, our 2 top took 15 minutes to seat outside but the front was sooo crowded, 4-5 sets w kids in tow. The weather was beautiful and all the food wonderful as usual. I had a Greek salad that was good but would have been better without the wilted greens and the Pear & Bleu Cheese flatbread we shared. So yummy, that flatbread could be an appetizer at every meal. Dinner was Parmesan Crusted Chicken (may not be listed exactly like that, sorry) for me and he got the Stuffed Cheddar Burger(again may not be actual name). Also per usual for my pics, we've taken bites already! He also asked them to do a lil Happy Birthday thing, which yes super sweet but I don't like that attention. He really liked the cheesecake btw. Great service. I apologize for not remembering our lady server's name but she had A Lot of tables and was a total pro!",

I also need to mention the mood lighting in this place, love that touch :) We can never seem to make it to dessert but the times we've had it it's always fresh & delicious. If you can't decide on which type of cheesecake to order you can't go wrong with the original slice with strawberries :) The warm bread is also a nice touch to start getting full before your food arrives.",

    "text": "Arrghhh, I hit a key accidentally and my almost-complete review disappeared!  To re-create:  It was senile dementia that brought us to the Cheesecake Factory.  Let me explain: Friends were visiting from CA, and after we sat around drinking wine and munching on cheese and crackers, we turned to the serious problem of where to go for dinner.  The couple has been to Vegas often, but mostly in the SW valley, where their son lives.  Herb came up with the brilliant suggestion to go to Mixx, and I readily agreed, thinking it would be something different for them.  We were presented with menus and water, and as I was explaining the bowl concept to them, I suddenly had a Duh! moment, and realized that the very next night we were going to meet a group of neighbors for Happy Hour in this very restaurant.  We had already decided that at HH we'd order two Fresh Market big bowls instead of the HH apps, so that we could take home leftovers, my favorite meal.  But we didn't remember any of that when we set out for Mixx.  We certainly weren't going to do that two nights in a row.  So, completely chagrined, we told the waitress we'd see her tomorrow night.  Cheesecake Factory, being right next door, was the obvious substitute, since we didn't want to start thinking all over again.  All four of us ordered from the Skinnylicious menu, probably in atonement for the excesses of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's.  Our friend had the Flatbread with Pear and Blue Cheese, and loved it.  His wife had the Lettuce Wraps, picking the Asian \"tacos.\"  The dish looked beautiful, and she enjoyed it.  My husband ordered a Turkey and Avocado sandwich, which came on a bun with a bowl of salad, and he liked his, too.  And then there was me, deciding on the skinny version of the Turkey Burger. Wanting a change from buns, I chose the wheat baguette. And ranch on the side for my salad.  As soon as my fork touched the burger, it fell apart, but it tasted okay.  But that wheat baguette was no wheat baguette.  It was more like pumpernickel, and it was SWEET!  So were the caramelized onions - adding sugar is a sloppy shortcut for the slow cooking that renders them naturally sweet.  My salad didn't come with the ranch dressing I asked for.  Instead, it had the house dressing already on it.  Lots of it.  When the waiter brought a new salad and the ranch, that dressing turned out to be strangely sweet, too.  Sweet ranch??? Yuk, and yuk also for the salad, which was a sizable portion, but completely different from the one my husband got.  Not my kind of mix.  Service was impersonally okay, but just average.  Three of us four liked what we ordered.  I'm the outlier, but I'm the one writing the review, so I get to give it three stars.  And I'm being generous.",

    "text": "I have been a  fan of Cheesecake Factory and have eaten at several locations in different cities. The menu is massive and mostly everything I've tried is good.  They are always busy in the early evenings so expect a long wait time. Lately I've use them through Door Dash which is gaining popularity and they need to recognize but everything does not* go smoothly.  Door Dash customers are not as valued as restaurant patrons and this should be addressed by Cheesecake Factory and Door Dash restaurants participants. If you specify something in \"special instructions\" Do Not** expect them to get it right. If you want extra salad dressing, Do Not** expect to get it. If you want extra sauce, Do Not** expect to get it. If you don't want your onions grilled, DO NOT** expect to get it. It ruins the meal you've ordered and paid for and you know you're being blown off because you're not in their face which is just lazy customer service. I get they probably understaff the cooks but out of 10 Door Dash deliveries they got 2 correct and I'm not asking for anything huge. CF needs to appreciate and value the Door Dash and curbside customers. Just because the customer isn't in your face doesn't mean they don't matter. I've lightened up on ordering from them because of this issue. When you call the 855 corporate number (and I have) they couldn't care less hence the 1 star rating for corporate. It's enough to make me go elsewhere.",

    "text": "\"Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake? You know I love to go there Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney\" - Drake  My roomie likes two things: Drake and Cheesecake Factory. And she had gotten a particular Drake song in her head and asked if I could take her to Cheesecake Factort. It was her birthday after all.   This Cheesecake Factory is located in the Boca Park shopping center in Summerlin. Not hard to find as it is probably one of their anchor stores for that shopping center.  Maybe it's the location [you are in Summerlin afterall] but this location seems more elegant and dressed up than your average Cheesecake Factory. Parking can be a hassle but there are valets outside.  Anyways, on to why this is a 4 star rating.  My girlfriend and I took my roommate to dinner for her birthday yesterday. As soon as we entered the girlie and I took a seat while my roomie gave the group's name to the hostess. We had sat down and were called almost immediately! Talk about service.   Our server was a very nice woman named Cathy B. who was very attentive. I'm HUGE on customer service and recognize it whenever I see stellar service. She was a sweet, kept our drinks filled, took our plates away as soon as we were done eating and we were even able to get her and the rests of the servers to come over and sing 'happy birthday' to the B-day girl.   The total experience was excellent and left an impression on me. And that's a big plus because I'm generally not a fan of chain restaurants like C.F. or Olive Garden.  Now on to the food.  For an appetizer I had an order of buffalo chicken wings. They were yummy and had the right amount of zing to them. The best thing I had that night!  For dinner I ordered the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It was cooked to order and even had pork belly in it. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Pretty average. And the only reason I can't give my visit a perfect rating.   I did have a bite of the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and it was good. I don't have much in terms of a sweet tooth so I can't say that the cheesecake wow'ed me but it did was plated very beautifully. Nice job on the presentation.",

Our ticket time for our entree was clearly in the 45 min zone and no manager in site. Problems can be mitigated by addressing them head on and seeking resolution. Maybe our server forgot to put in our order, but why not a manger touching tables and being visible? You know it's a problem when our server asked us if we would like dessert and we said not if it takes as long as our entree, and she replied \" I have no control of the kitchen, but I can control dessert better\" ya.... no thank you. Again, a manager presence or a table touch could have made all the difference. Please use this as a teaching moment for staff. Our bill was Sunday around 230p.

Many start with ideals of quality, sourcing, and customer care, and get shoddy over the years. Not so for the Cheesecake Factory. Year after year, ingredient quality, service and food prep stay at a superb level.  Tonight: Sheila's chicken and avocado salad. The greens were super-fresh and included chicory, arugula, and baby spinach. Crispy won-tons (I removed mine), cashews, moist breast slices, perfectly ripe avo's, and a few other items rounded things off. As a carb-conscious diner with a healthy appetite, this dish was most satisfying.  In the past, I've also enjoyed the Asian chicken salad, grilled salmon with mashed (ok, it was a carb-splurge day ;) and 3-4 other dishes I can't recall.  Their managers are even gracious if there's ever an issue.  My \"only\" humorous-complaint is their menu listing several pages of \"specialties\". If everything is \"special\", then nothing is.

REALLY REALLY GOOD I also ordered a slice of chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake to go but I prefer their original.  We will definitely come back",

Our server brought waters and bread right away and everything was off to a good start. The menu here is massive and I never know what to order. They have over 200 items, how can you decide?!? I finally chose the bacon-bacon cheeseburger with fries, mainly because I am obsessed with the ranch here and wanted to dip something in it. Yeah, I am a ranch freak. Side note, you can buy the ranch and all of their dressings to-go.   So we all order and then wait for our food. I expected there to be a long wait but it was pretty quick. Everyone gets their food but my grandma. Also, I realized I got the wrong burger. When our server comes back, he apologizes and says he will get those out right away. 20 minutes later, me and grandma still have no food. Everyone else is pretty much done eating at this point. Finally our food shows up, and by this time my appetite is gone so I take everything to go. We also ordered cheesecake, because duh. I ordered the pumpkin, (seasonal) and since it was my birthday, they brought it out singing. I love being embarrassed on my birthday, said no one ever. Our server was able to get the manager to comp some of our meal, which was much appreciated. We probably won't be eating here again anytime soon, but I will be back to get some cheesecake.",

It's sad because we've eaten at this Cheesecake a lot and we've always had great service, however,  whoever is hiring people need to maybe hire a different person other than Hannah because it's not a nice experience for customers who pay good money to be customers to be treated poorly when calling to make a pick up order.",

My favorite is the Mexican Tortilla Salad, which is always yummy, which has less than 590 calories.

We like to eat at home on V-Day, in case a romantic mood strikes and we need to handle our valentine's Day extracurricular activities right there on the spot.  Pretty much every pasta dish here is so bomb, it makes my spirit soar and my body react in a borderline sexual manner, so naturally, Cheesecake Factory take out was our decision this fine evening.   Now listen, I'm not exaggerating when I say there was a line of 5-10 cars waiting for take out and the manager Sara was running around the parking lot, directing traffic, fighting crime, carrying 5 bags at a time, and heroically getting people's food to them in the cold. She was like Wonder Woman. At one point, I think she actually flew but I can't say for certain. She was dodging cars, slinging that delicious cheesecake left and right, just being a straight take-out savage, as we all stood by like PEASANTS in the presence of a higher power. Impressed by her service, I tried to tip her and she wouldn't let me (which is my only real complaint)   If Sara doesn't have a raise/promotion the next time I come back here, I will be taking her, my top notch review and my business to a more deserving restaurant.  Long live Sara the Great.",

    "text": "On August 6th, at around 6 PM a party of 5 arrived and were immediately seated in a coveted booth set up. They were instantly greeted by a young in-his-30's male waiter (I can't remember his name but I can tell you he has private small gym stickers on his ordering book and was wearing a Darth Vader tie.) Bread was delivered. And this is when it started to get interesting... One of the party members was a known picky person. She frequents this establishment and has had no problems ordering her usual request in the past.  Fast forward to post ordering meal delivery. Corn tamales gluten free ON POINT! A salad entree arrived and a party member politely stated that the dressing order on the side is not present. Now this is where I need to tell you how Cheesecake operates: Your your food is not delivered by the waiter it is delivered by someone else. And a majority of your service is delivered by some random person. The only time you see your waiter is when they decide to come back and check on you. It took 15 minutes to get that dressing nectar. The picky person's entree was completely wrong. She was not happy. After a weird conversation with the waiter - he actually stated out of the 30 page menu that no chicken breast existed in the building...a manager became involved and in 5 minutes the glorious food arrived! Meanwhile a party member still had not received his SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS. This member had the easiest order and it came out 10 minutes after everyone including the totally messed up redone entree did. Fast forward to dessert ordering, it was asked to be to go it came back on a plate about 10 minutes later it arrived in a to go container. Whatever that was OK because it took us about 10 minutes to get the bill situated. I forgot to tell you that in the middle of dinner two of the party members asked for extra sauce and we got the bill we noticed that we were charged four dollars for a little gravy boat of sauce (note in the past I have never been charged for extra sauce so this came as a real shock.) My sister was charge for an extra side of potatoes that never was ordered (she asked for double mashed instead of the vegetable.) All of these bogus charges were removed and we all learned a valuable lesson: never to order extra sauce at Cheesecake Factory ever again. Because of the way everything ended out in the end (bill rightfully modified and foods delivered as ordered - btw the side of mashed and two sauces dropped the bill FIFTEEN DOLLARS!) I give this place three stars but overall I am disappointed with what Cheesecake Factory has become. I won't be returning anytime soon. Shout out to management for making it all happen ON MY BIRTHDAY!",

Today we met some friends for lunch. When we arrived and walked in I let them know we had a party of six and I asked the girl If there was a wait and she said \"no there isn't a wait\" I said great. She takes my name and says it will be about five minutes. I was like what, you just said there wasn't a wait?????? I wasn't upset that there was gonna be a wait but for the fact she said there wasn't going to be one was kind of annoying.  I thought okay maybe they have to get a table to fit us. That wasn't the issue because after waiting about ten minutes they walked us over to a booth which was sitting next to a handful of other empty booths.  Again I wasn't mad about waiting but just annoying that she lied, bizarre right??  Anyway, the host gives us our menus and about five minutes goes by before our super,  sweet and nice waitress arrives to get our drink orders. She goes to retrieve our drinks, drops them off and I realize we don't have straws for our drinks; only a straw for my sons (which they put in). I actually prefer to do this ourselves. Again just annoying.  We wait for about five minutes before anyone walks by before we scored straws.    Next, we finally get our food orders in and our meals finally arrived about 25 minutes; after giving our orders.    The food was good and I do like that they have added the calories of their meals to menus,  as well as new items.   When it was time to pay getting our bill took forever; once she dropped the bills off it took another ten minutes before she came back to retrieve them. It was annoying again.    My last complaint was that the booth was filthy. There was dust on one of the napkins, corn dog sticks between the wall and seat as well as on the on the floor. There were crumbs all over the seats and the floors were dirty. The place really needs a deep clean. If the dining area is filthy that makes me assume that the kitchen must be pretty dirty.   I can promise you this; I'm finding a different Cheesecake Factory to eat at and never visit this establishment again",

Once seated we figured things would go quickly, but we were very wrong, about 30 minutes before we could order then another hour waiting for food at our table. After waiting an hour one dish was over cooked and caught by the manager before being delivered, we were told it'd be comped because the person had to wait even longer for food, it wasn't. So, we spent a total of three and a half hours here with \"ok\" food and were over charged. Not worth it at all.",

I had the BBQ pork sandwich with sweet potato fries.  There was a bit too much sauce, but the cole slaw helped tame the OD of sassy richness.  Overall, I give my meal last night \"thumbs up\".  Any cheesecake for dessert is a must with a multitude of selections to choose from.  Peace!",

Cheeseburger egg rolls were served without ketchup. When we were all done for the evening and asked for a to go box we patiently waited for ten minutes and finally took it upon ourselves to get up and get one. Like I said the restaurant was dead. There's no reason for the service to have been as slow as it was. Cheesecake Factory  was disappointing on a night of celebration for our family.",

This time around i\"m with my wife and 4 year old son. After we ordered our drinks we received our complimentary bread. Our server brought out my son his own small bread plate with sliced bananas. Thought that was excellent, never seen that before!  We both had separate chicken dishes. They wete ordered and in no time, on a Friday night they were at our table. I'd say they were faster than Jimmy John's. We split with our son and he gobbled it all up. She had the chicken picata an I had the chicken marsala. Both were fantastic.   Now time for dessert. Cheesecake Factory is famous for what? Their Cheesecake!!! Oh my, decision, decision, decision! There is just so much how can 1 person plus a 4 yeat old decide? Seems I'm sharing with my son so he'll decide.   So it's decided, the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. The cake was enormous so we split it amongst us. The only thing i didn't really care for was the whipped cream. It had a blan taste but overall it was fantastic.   Our server was great. He was busy however he went above my expectations. Food was great and served quickly. Our drinks were refreshed even when we didn't ask.   I think 1 thing they could improve on is the lighting. We sat in a part of the restaurant that the overhead lights were high in the ceiling which made it hard to read the menu.   Overall we're beyond satisfied. Especially when we were visited by a cricket",

Found plastic in my pasta. #justbecausetheturtleseatitdoesntmeaniwanttoo. Lack of Sauce, it's like I was eating spaghetti in the Mojave desert. All the meatballs where cooked differently. The butter was half melted. Did not get bread until I asked for it after my meal came out. Never got refills on my drink. In my opinion, it's the managers job to make sure my experience is made better, after I have the experience I had with my family. And I left feeling like my experience wasn't made better. I definitely won't be back to this Chessecake factory location. You would think that in an area like Boca Park, that the service and food quality would be high. Thank God there was salt and pepper on the table because the food definitely needed. #shouldofwenttoYardHouse",

    "text": "I went on September 12, 2017 @ 7:00. After using the free valet service I walked into the restaurant and asked about sitting outside for 1. The lady up front said it would be a 10 minute wait. I said ok I'll wait. Once I was called and seated outside. The waitress kept walking by 15 times with only 2 other parties outside at the time. At this point I was getting pissed. But I continued to wait till a lady finally Came (can't remember her name) and took my food & drink order. Once my food came out she never came by to check on me and by this time there was only 1 other party seated outside. I kept waving her down but she never stopped to see what I needed. After a haft hour I finally was able to get her and asked about getting a Togo box and the dessert menu. 20 minutes went by no Togo box or dessert menu. Another 20 minutes went by finally she brings me the menu and Togo box. Then another 20 minutes she finally came back and took my dessert order for Togo. She immediately brought me my bill and told me the order for the cheesecake is in it will be about 5 minutes. Well 5 minutes turned into a 50 minute dessert for Togo. Finally left the restaurant at 9:30.   I did come into contact with a manger (heavy guy) that could care less. He pretty much said here's the corporate number have a great day.   Come on 2 hours of just sitting and receiving bad service? NEVER AGAIN. CORPORATE WILL BE CONTRACTED.",

Because of this, I ordered a personal pizza and chicken tenders. I was wrong and a big, still warm pizza came with large chicken tenders and fries. I ended up having to take most of it home. The wait for our food was a bit long but we had delicious bread at our table along with butter. 10/10 would go there again.",

I was barely cooked and was still gray without a hint of orange indicating it was cooked.  Basically it was barely heated.  I brought it to the attention of the server who told the manager.  The manager came over and apologized and did not charge for my entree.  However, the serving of seafood in this manner was incredibly unsafe and it really was inexcusable to be plated and served.",

Southwest eggrolls, Chicken Coquettes w/fontina cheese, Avacado Eggrolls, Stuffed Mushrooms in marsala wine sauce. Over 30 items under $6 for HH. That's impressive! Everything was well cooked and delicious. Large, well made drink specials like Long Island Iced Tea $5, pizza for the kids and desserts to make you smile or moan.  A special small plate menu in addition to the HH menu. Many, many choices on the regular menu around $13 which is a bargain in LV.  I met several people who eat there 2-3x a week. This chain is a winner and tops any other I have ever been to. Going to miss it since there is none within 3 hrs of me.  The Rampart location does get crowded but there is plenty of parking although. you may have to walk a block across the parking lot if it is dinner hour. Have not tried the strip location inside Caesars Forum Shopping complex.",

    "text": "I can't believe when  I was younger I actually thought the Cheesecake Factory was considered fine-dining. Thankfully my tastes have evolved over the years. They still have decent dishes, as far as national chain restaurants go. But, quality is something I don't associate with this place anymore. Since when is tuna gray? That was the case with the tuna tartare that arrived at my table. It was mainly a stack of avocado with a few chunks of gray tuna on top. Other dishes that I've had recently have been ok -- the  avocado eggrolls were perfectly crispy and not too oily and the chicken samosas were decent. Then, of course there's the cheesecake. It's the main reason why I liked this place growing up. On our last visit we tried the tiramisu cheesecake and the chocolate mouse cheesecake. Neither had the rich, creamy, indulgent taste that I remember. Unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory just doesn't live up to the expectations I once built up. Although I'm not totally ruling out a return visit when my cheesecake craving returns.",

My second favorite would have to be the Cajun Chicken Littles... and that is a very, very close second!  I love all the dipping sauces-- especially their ranch!  You have to ask for it because it doesn't come with the dish.  This location is always super busy...but probably not as busy as the Caesar's one. My favorite cheesecakes are, in no special order: original, white chocolate raspberry, banana cream, and cookie dough.  My favorite non-cheesecake dessert there is definitely Linda's Chocolate Cake.  It is super moist and chocolatey!!  Also love their strawberry lemonade!!",

We got there and it was pretty busy but was sat within 4 minutes. Where we got sat was unfortunately cramped with other restaurant patrons seated so close to us we almost thought they were eating with us. It took approximately 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us who let us know that he isn't really our server but will get us some water while we wait. The Menu That takes you about 25 minutes to read cause it's more like a novel than an menu had bought our \"real server\" time I guess to realize she's our waitress. We only got 1 order of bread I guess our first and last cause my friend mentioned to our \"not our waiter\" and our \"real waiter\" for more bread while we wait for our meal that was already taking a while of which was ignored. The experience was not a good one, They would of gotten 1 star but I gave 2 cause honestly we felt sorry for our waitress cause she appeared overwhelmed. I think Cheesecake Factory needs to re train their staff.",

I was definitely proven wrong on my trip here! The waiting area was obviously ridiculously packed so I expected the wait to be nothing less then an hour. Thirty minutes later we were sat and promptly offered bread and had our drink order taken . Our food arrived within 15/20 min after we ordered and let me say it was delicious! Our server Dan was was super great. He checked on us several times , refilled our drinks and asked how our food was .

    "text": "Located in Boca Park, we had a late dinner here on a Friday night.  Main reason for us coming here...I was hungry and wanted something that I was low on calories, higher on protein, and close to where we were currently at.  Plus, the food at Cheesecake Factory is as consistent as it gets. Yes, I said lower on calories and The Cheesecake Factory has a special menu for this.  Drumroll...their SkinnyLicious menu. In the last 4 months, I've been to a Cheesecake Factory about 5 times.  Every single time, my meal of choice comes from their healthier options.  This menu has a range from chicken breast, steak, tacos, some fish, and turkey.  Of course, there's a bunch of salad options, but I don't do salads. I tried their White Chicken Chili with Brown Rice.  I was surprised that my meal was less than 500 calories.  It was damn good.  It's basically a lighter chili sauce, some brown rice mixed in, and a whole lot of chicken breast pieces.  Loved it!  As for the service, it didn't start off too well.  It was a Friday night and we got seated right away.  But it took forever for our server to come and take our order. I had to give the eye to one of the employees walking by just to get service.  Within 5 minutes, service is what we got.  By the way, service was great from then on.   Overall, I'm still giving Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because of their SkinnyLicious Menu and familiar dishes.   PS:  Hard to say no to the bread basket.  Their brown bread is phenomenal.

I tried to make it work, maybe took two bites, told her I wasn't happy with it, still on the bill and still paid the $15.  Birthday time. I had told a manager about the birthday, server handed him the menu, he selected which slice, the sang happy birthday, then charged for the cake.  I'm a server, it's hard to even write a bad review for me, but that service was just not how guest should be treated. I shouldn't have had to remake my salad when there was an error.

After walking in and sliding and almost falling on their greasy floor, we sat exactly 25 minutes after ordering Burgers, and they could not even bring the bread, never mind the entree. The waiter came over no less than 5 times to tell us he was sorry, but he keeps checking and they keep telling him 'their baking it' We finally got up and left. The manager came over with a feeble attempt to apologize, but with no explanation as to why they could not get bread out of the kitchen for 25 minutes after ordering. Horrible customer service!!!! I will give this place one more try since as bad as it was , we had nothing but good experiences prior over a very long time period. I mean years. They need to do something about that greasy floor. Its been complained about a long time by not only myself but others I know. I guess when someone falls and gets badly hurt, they will take care of it.",

Even though this place is big and offers plenty of seating inside and outdoors, it is always packed. Parking can be a pain but I have never had to wait that long for a table. Our server (name escapes me sorry dude) was always checking on us and friendly.   Started out with Stuffed Mushrooms. I have had these with clam or sausage before...but these had a blend of cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce. We got 6 with the order and they did not last long. I used some of the bread that was brought to the table to soak up the last bit of the wine sauce.   For dinner I had a Macaroni & Cheese Burger. This was a risky choice...I knew I would either love it or hate it. The burger had fried macaroni balls and cheese sauce on it. I asked them to leave the veggies off my burger this time because I did not know if fried mac & cheese and tomatoes, onion or lettuce go good together or not. The burger was very cheesy and I enjoyed it. The fries it came with were hot and good. The side of ranch I requested was nasty though. It does not even taste like ranch but something bitter and gross and the color was more clear than white. My wife had half of a chicken salad sandwich and cup of tortilla soup. She enjoyed her sandwich and loved the soup but didn't like her salad due to the same nasty ranch being on it. I had half of her soup and liked it as well. We both left fulfilled and happy and had no room for cheesecake.",

The waiter was kind enough, when he noticed me picking out the shrimp to get me new shrimp... However at this point I was already done eating and boxing up my left-overs. The fresh lemonade was very sweet-- fair warning if you are hoping for tart lemonade.  Overall, the service was great and the atmosphere is always nice; it just depends what you decide to order from the extensive menu if you will really enjoy the while experience.  BUT- I am disowning The Cheesecake Factory yet... I have had some really great meals with them. ( Like the beet & goat cheese salad and their non-alcoholic pina colada) B",

The manager; Caesar, had no idea how to handle customer service either. When he told us the hostess made a mistake he never apologized and just simply said you will have to wait. WOW. We have been going to this restaurant for many years. People don't return because of the poor service and treatment and you can count us out. We won't be back.",

I have had their cheesecake from friends who picked up dessert for birthdays and such.  It's perfect for families and for those date nights. It can be noisy but when me and my girlfriend arrived the waitress sat us in the corner and we felt all alone.   My girlfriend went with some basic chicken fingers but I did the Shepard's pie and boy was it sooo good. It was full of flavor and perfect for a cold day. The serving was soooo big which is not a bad thing. I ate all of it and when it came to dessert time the slice of cheesecake was huge!! I got the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and it was a perfect for a sweet tooth! My girlfriend couldn't finish hers but I ate all of mine ha ha.  Edit: I can't believe I forgot that we started with mini crab cakes. They were good and this is from someone who doesn't eat much crab except for sushi.  The food and service was good. The prices were not bad for the amount of food you get. Definitely returning!",

    "text": "Having moved to the area, i was excited to go to cheesecake factory. This is my third attempt to eat at their Summerlin location, as the other two attempts have not gone well. There is no service standard what so ever. So last Saturday on October 17th, around 10:30 pm, my girlfriend and i went in. There was nothing going on; as Boca Park dies around 9:30pm all week. We sat in the bar, and were greeted by our server. My gf orders a coffee, i get an iced tea, iced tea came out fine coffee was ice cold. we let the server know. and a new pot was brewed 10 minutes later my girlfriend gets her coffee. While waiting we were ofered bread, complimentary bread is nice, no knives to cut the bread or spread butter though. Well we finally ordered now we have been here for close to 30 minutes, my i get a quesadilla, she gets an omelet. On the first attempt its the wrong order. now the manager comes by, he wants to make sure we have a good experience then you Frankie our experience blew. So now he goes to the kitchen tells us he will make sure everything comes out perfect. The next omelet comes out and is completely raw, with a long black hair through it  So now we have been here for 45 minutes, the ambiance is terrible, the service is terrible the food quality is terrible and now lets hit management. So Frankie comes up to us and deeply apologizes and tells none of his cooks have long black hair, that's all well and good but my girlfrined is blonde. So he then tells us that our bill would be comped and offered us cmplimentary cheese cake. we respectfully declined as we just wanted to leave. I put $15.00 on the table for the server to call it what it is. We walked out and the manager came running out frantically screaming at us as if we skipped out on the bill. NO, FRANKIE, YOU SAID THE BILL WAS COMPED! So we come back into see what this clown was going to charge us with, we then are given a bill from a server who was not even ours telling us this is our bill..   Like i said I have tried this place 3x since I have moved to Vegas and they are horribly ran. Their don't give a shit attitude its Summerlin is horrendous. Frankie has zero customer service! Insteqad of retaining customers, you lost one. Cold Coffee. No knives. Wrong Order. Chased in to the Parking lot but hey we were offered free cheesecake ..lol",

I've been to all 3 Las Vegas locations on more than one occasion but this experience has to be the worst by far.  I'm not one to complain but this was too many mistakes to go unnoticed.   The evening started seemingly ok.  The hostess took our name, said the wait would be 20 minutes and then handed us a beeper.  When 30 minutes past I went back up to ask where we were in the line.  She stated that she called us, which was impossible since we were sitting on the bench next to her stand.  Also, the beeper never went off so that onto itself was a lie.  Why give one to us a beeper if you aren't going to use it?    We sat down and our waitress seemed very nice (probably the only employee I didn't mind).  My boyfriend and I ordered our food but for some reason the food runner only brought out his food.  I sat and waited for a bit but then our waitress looked at my empty place setting and stormed off.  She came out immediately after with my food.  At the end of the meal, we ordered a slice of cheesecake to have at the restaurant but the food runner gave us our cheesecake in a \"to go\" box.  Our waitress again looked angry.    Lastly, today I opened my box of leftover pasta to find that my boyfriend's jalapeno peppers were mixed in with it.  He finished his meal and there wasn't anything left on his plate except the peppers. I found them everywhere in my food, they just weren't placed on top or on the side.  I decided not to eat it since someone messed with it enough to mix ingredients in.  Gross.",

The menu consists of appetizers, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, steaks, breakfast items, fish and seafood, deserts and over 40 cheesecake options. They also have a menu for people who are watching their calorie intake or have gluten allergies. During the weekends they offer a Sunday Brunch option, a tradition in many families. Every online posted experience, the food always met or exceeded their expectations. The food is always hot and fresh with great flavors. Here is a quote from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FFoodie.com&s=c812257fb4ca0d754baa241c99f41d13de1bb499108b4b475dd550738b6ef136\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foodie.com</a> about the Cheesecake factory: \"You want selection? There are two pages of just appetizers. TWO pages! Just check out all the mouthwatering selections online if you have a moment. I haven't even tried a tenth of their menu, and yet it remains one of my favorite places to eat. Go for the cheesecake, stay for the food, never a disappointment!\" This fabulous restaurant has incredible customer service. The staff will greet you right away. They will cater to your special occasions. As an example if you have a birthday or anniversary, they will surprise you with a free desert at the end of the meal. They will even gather the staff and sing happy birthday energetically to the birthday person. If it is an anniversary they will personalize the desert by writing happy anniversary. They will make alterations to the menu items to meet your needs and do it with a smile. Their great attitudes have made many post reviews online with many reputable sites. Some of them include <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FFoodie.com&s=c812257fb4ca0d754baa241c99f41d13de1bb499108b4b475dd550738b6ef136\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foodie.com</a> and Yelp. There are incredible reviews written on Yelp for all over the US, proving the consistency of great service. Depending on the mood you are in they have a dine-in and a take-out option. For the take-out option, they also provide curbside pickup. One of the Yelp the reviews said \"Our waiter and he was absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the best waiters I have ever had before. Not only was he very good at what he does (taking orders, getting drinks, making sure that everyone is taken care of at the table) he was also very personable. We talked to him a little bit in his down time, and he made us laugh a few times. Everyone at my table loved him, and said the same thing... that he is on of the best waiters we have ever had\" at a restaurant.\" The atmosphere is a great combination of everything that a person could want. As mentioned earlier there is a dine-in and a take-out option but they also have many other options. Sitting out on the patio to enjoy the weather or stay inside the dining room to avoid the weather. Join the bar for a more social environment. The best time for the bar is during happy hour for that social mood. You could also, snug yourself away in booth for a more intimate setting. The vibe of the restaurant is very upbeat, friendly, fun, personable and beautiful. The walls have beautiful large European murals and pillars. The space is open but a cozy feel as well. It is a place where to dress up or dress down. Guests can bring kids or eat alone. No matter what mood, no matter who the guest is, Cheesecake Factory is a place that all will enjoy. On <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FFoodie.com&s=c812257fb4ca0d754baa241c99f41d13de1bb499108b4b475dd550738b6ef136\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foodie.com</a> there are some great articles for Cheesecake factory. One of the quotes said \"I was just blown away by the architecture. The outrageous curves of the art nouveau architecture really sets the mood\"",

We had some fun with him and made him loosen up a little.  I'm sure he passed his test, but you need to keep it light.  This place was slamming busy on a Wednesday night with a short wait during the dinner rush hour.  We'll go back again when we're in town.",

    "text": "Just left this location and I feel the need to Yelp it right away. We were a party of 4, sat right away at 5:15pm and ordered at 5:20pm. So far so good, right? My food comes out (burger undercooked with onions on it and I said NO onions). I flag down the server, she takes it away. 15 min later, still no burger so I ask where is my food? Server tells me the kitchen ran out of burger patties and they are making more. Huh? Ok, whatever. 25 min goes by and I ask for a manager. Still no food. Manager (Robert) strolls over and says I will take burger iff the bill. And asks if there is anything else he can do? I said, well, I have been here for almost 1 hour and havent eaten anything. He offers me a piece of cheesecake and says \"I will go get it right away\". 10 min later, no manager, no cheesecake. We get up to leave, and the server asks if we got the cake? I said NO and the manager must have forgot. She turns and literally runs to the takeout area and gets my cake and comes back and 60 seconds. I ask for the GM of this location and she says the GM will be there on Wed. So, on Wed I will call this GM (Amy) and tell her to read this Yelp review. Its unfortunate that restaurants like Cheesecake Factory allow this to happen. I have always held them to a higher standard, but looks like they have some work to do. The manager, Robert was so nonchalant and obviously didnt care much about \"being right back\" with my cheesecake. Unteal. My grade: F",

Our waitress most of the time was nowhere to be found and had a non caring attitude.  And without being long winded...she wasn't the only one there.  I really lime the location and hope that the next time I'm there on vacation that the service will be much better.",

    "text": "So I went last night with my hubby to the cheesecake factory and I was highly disappointed. I give only 2 stars and that's for the cheesecake, it was the only good thing.  To start with our server, Shannon D, I think she doesn't like her job. A server myself, we got not enough attention from her and she didn't stop by to ask how aour food was tasting. Cause I sure had a problem with our calamari that were not so good. I have no idea what the kitchen did, that half of them were sticking together in a big clump and they seamed not cleaned the right way, too. Our server was more concerned how much tips she made from the big party that was right across from us, then taking a little more care on the other guest. My dink was empty for a while and it was sure not that busy, cause the big party already left. By the way, if you iron your shirt and pants, you might look a little more professional, then looking crumbled up from head to toe. It's not really nice to look at, remember your in a service job! Right as we got the check, is when she asked how our food was, hello, that was a little to late. So we're not going to go back to this location. I would understand if this place was packed, but it was pretty empty.",

I love the luau salad, my husband always gets the bang bang chicken and shrimp.  I always get the strawberry shortcake at the end, it's a huge biscuit filled to the brim with fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and topped with whipped cream.  Even if you normally order cheesecake, try this dessert one day, it's so good!!",

    "text": "I love Cheesecake factory but the service here left a bad taste in my mouth. My dad gave me Cheesecake factory gift cards so I went with my mom and my two brothers for dinner. I walked to reserve a table because the parking can get a bit crazy around dinner time.I walked to the Hostess and told her that I would like to reserve a table for four, She then had asked me my name and she must have had a hard time hearing me because after I said it she said \"What was your name?!\" Spot on shitty attitude for a hostess. I then asked her if she could check how much money was on the cards my dad gave me for Christmas and she said \"well I can't check that over here but if you wanna go over there they can check for you\" with an even shittier attitude. I then went over to the counter where they could check the credit of my gift cards and the man who checked them was cool unlike his boogie ass co worker of a host. I didn't have to wait that long to be seated which was nice. Our waiter on the other hand was acting like there was a bomb tied to her waist that would explode if she didn't do her job. I could tell in her voice that she didn't wanna be there which made it awkward for me and my family. On the other hand the food was really good. I'm gonna come back again just with high hopes I don't come across that same waitress or that hostess, except for that other guy he was cool as fuck.",

So, can't really tell you much about the dining room seating other then there are always people waiting.  Cheesecake Factory has almost anything you could be craving from seafood to steak to great pasta and it's usually ALL good. And, as always their cheesecake is always fresh and tasty.   For Boca Park it can get busy, but as mentioned, if you don't mind the bar, hit it up for quicker seating and service.",
