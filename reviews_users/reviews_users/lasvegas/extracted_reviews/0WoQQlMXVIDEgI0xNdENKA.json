    "text": "We have been going to this buffet off and on for years and the quality is definitely headed downhill. We took the kids yesterday and we disliked almost everything and we are not picky.   The fruit was fine, of course that would be awfully hard to mess up, but the mashed potatoes, grits, pot stickers, rice, and several other little things were pretty bad and left on the plates. My husband did like the pulled pork, and my daughter liked the pork buns....guess it was a good pork day? My favorite thing was the sourdough bread and butter, if that tells you anything. The kids said the ice cream was good, but my pumpkin pie was gross and artificial tasting.  We have noticed that the quality is better on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Not sure if that is because there is more turnover or you cannot use your 2 for 1 coupons those days. This buffet is possibly worth it, if you have the 2 for 1 (8.99 for 2 lunches) otherwise, this would be near the bottom of my list of places to eat.",

As if you'd be worrying about sugar when you eat at a buffet. They have different ice cream flavors, gelato, AND soft serve with a topping bar of course! You can even make an ice cream cookie sandwich if you so desire. The pastry section offers different kinds of pie and again, with sugar-free options.  $3 specialty drinks if you want some adult bevies.  Excellent service, it's like they're secretly watching you eat and clear your plate as soon as you eat your last bite and refill your drinks right away.   Sign up for a boarding pass card for $3 off :)",

We waited like 10 for our drinks, just coffee and juice , enough  time to do the buffet line and still no drinks.  When we asked for the drinks little high school looking  server gives us the whatever and grumpy off.  We ask for new server and move on.  The old server then shows up at table doing the bad movie thug shoulder  shrug and yelling at table you got a problem.  Wow suddenly  a Las Vegas resort is Walmart.   Wow very professional. .   To top it off later manager comes over , was it to apologize  for the H.S. drama?   No it was to threaten us with security because the server ( hmm a relation?)  Said he felt threatened.

The food was fresh and frequently updated.   However, the real kicker was at the dessert counter. The Spinoni ice cream was outstanding. And their cheesecake was good too. But don't miss the ice cream. What a treat!",

I came here for my friend's rehearsal dinner and they were very good about accomodating such a large group of people. The service was good and it's a good option when you have a huge group of people with different food preferences, so I would highly recommend this place for larger groups as well.

They served very tasty slices of pork and what I kept coming back for was this mango mousse cup, just delectable! They have such a huge dessert section! In fact, they have so many different stations of ethnic food. It was quite a drive here but so worth it since the place was beautiful and very relaxing. I cannot wait to come back here again.",

    "text": "$24.99 for a seafood buffet is not too shabby! The wait wasn't as long as other buffets such as Wicked Spoon or the M buffet.  You need to have their players club card in order to get the $24.99 price and one card is good for 2 people.  I'm not sure how much it is regularly without the card since myself and my parents had cards and we only needed 2 for our party of 4 that included my brother. They had a good selection of food and I felt that it was worth the $24.99 price.  The only reason I took off one star was for a few reasons: the crab was a little too salty for my liking (although it gave it some added flavor, I was only able to eat one plate full as opposed to my usual 2-3 plates of crab), their shrimp po boys had a weird taste to them (not sure if it was the sauce they put on the shrimp...but also the bread was hard), and their cookies in the dessert section were rock hard.  The dishes I tried included the following: crab legs, steamed mussels, morange glazed mahi, fried catfish and jalapeno hush puppies, tom yum soup, clam chowder, shrimp ceviche, prawns, oyster shooter, and chili mussels.  That's all that I can remember that I ate haha.  I liked that they gave each of us a crab opener device thingy, but I had to ask for more napkins.  One napkin was not enough! They should know that it would get messy! It's a bummer though that this is only offered Fridays in June and not all the time.  I think I shoveled down food way too fast in the beginning because I got full way too fast!",

The Grand Cafe, Movie Theater and Buffet are the only things I like about the Red Rock Hotel (I hate that place, but that's a different story).  Out of all the buffets I've been to, this one and the Rio are the only two which have good sushi. Sushi is always lackluster in buffet settings, but at least here it's fresh most of the time and is at least somewhat comparable to the quality of an actual sushi bar.  The service can be a little snooty at times (the Red Rock is essentially a giant Strip wannabe), but they do their job by always providing your requests.  Dessert section=love. Cannoli, Cheesecake, Gelato and Tiramisu, hooray for diabetes.  The Red Rock is essentially in the middle of nowhere so I rarely ever come here, but I never regret the trek out here whenever I do.",

I thought the price was reasonable and the service was fast.  The main items I enjoyed were the Sushi, Carving Station and the Deserts were incredible because of the gelato.  This is a great place and will always be on my list for the best buffet in Summerlin.   P.S. DO NOT GO DURING LUNCH because it will be packed with people who think EATING IS A SPORT and get  Competitive to finish everything before you get to it LMAO.",

As for the desert station it was horrible as well, everything was dry and hard and inedible except the Ice Cream, of course, but had to wait over 5 minutes to get someone to scoop us out a scoop, astonishingly enough the ice cream wasn't bad.  I have eaten at the Feast Buffet at Boulder numerous times and never had a complaint, this is the first and last time visiting Red Rock Feast Buffet.  If I could give it negative star rating I would, stay away from the Feast at Red Rock, it is not worth any money let alone $15 a head after tax.",

At one point I just got tired of waiting on a refill and walked into the service area and refilled my own glass. This was the Seafood Buffet, at a higher price, however from what I saw most of the seafood swam away from this Buffet. They should be ashamed of calling this a Seafood Buffet. You can do Much better in Vegas for the $ 17.00 spent on this lower quality buffet. And did I forget to mention it was almost an hour wait from entering the line to being seated.",

I think this buffet is pretty standard for Vegas buffet fare, but if you're on this side of Vegas I'm not sure there are a lot of similar choices around. It was reasonably priced when we came here for dinner one night and there are plenty of options for different types of food for you to enjoy. I don't think anything in particular stood out, but it wasn't a mediocre meal either. I would say I probably enjoyed it more than the different Station buffets I've been to.

Now they have a few stations starting from Asian fusion to Mexican to American to Italian to desserts. The food were not that great! I've had better and cheaper.

Desserts where pretty tasty. Everything else was mediocre. The final straw was when we noticed a pair of used men's boxer shorts in the buffet area on a pedestal. We tried getting the attention of a server( not our server)  who told us not to bother her because she couldn't leave her area. Finally alerted the manager who apologized and had them removed .

The choices for Breakfast ranged from ham, scrambled eggs, waffles and pancakes to donuts, bagels and tacos. The food tasted fresh and was absolutely delicious.

It's a great deal except that the alcohol stops you from eating as much, so beware! Okay, the food is good and interesting. They have a little of everything from mexican, american, chinese, indian(the health food options), sushi, salad and dessert bars; also breakfast, cuz duh! I enjoyed almost everything I ate and just hate that my stomach won't fit EVERYTHING in like it used to, without clogging me up. ooops, tmi.   Just give it a shot.

The selection is pretty good but dinner has been underwhelming- lunch is your best option.  Breakfast: Typical breakfast buffet selection. On weekends you may luck out and find shrimp and grits, which is done excellently here. Other than that, it's just fine. Nothing in particular stands out.  Lunch: Best time to go, selection is large and you'll have most of the dinner options. Start with massive salad bar, end with a smorgasbord of desserts including a gelato bar. The Mexican food options are surprisingly solid.  Dinner: Underwhelming. Little to differentiate it from lunch options. Seafood selection (my favorite) is limited, sushi quality is comparable to a grocery store, shrimp are small and not very clean.   Service is consistently good, and you can find locals discounts pretty easily. Always surprised by how busy this place is.",

The Italian pasta with sundried tomatoes had a very off taste. The pie crusts were no longer light and tasty. The bread pudding shrank from a moist pan to individual dried up items.

We were here last week with a party of 5 adults and 2 kids and they made us wait in line like an additional 10 min to \"find\" a table big enough for 7 people. Meanwhile, people behind us with smaller parties of 2 or 4 were being let in first. When we were finally seated in the back, we realized the entire back area was full of clean, empty tables! All they had to do was push 2 of them together...why did it take so long?!  The best thing about this buffet is that they have sushi! Well, mainly California, tuna and salmon rolls so nothing exotic but still! Sushi at a $8 lunch buffet! I usually hit the sushi first, followed by selections from the rest of the Asian section based on what looks good. The Asian section is pretty hit or miss too. Next, I always hit up the American section in the middle to grab items like fried chicken, sausage, mac & cheese, etc. Then I grab dessert. I never really eat off the Mexican or Italian sections because they're not that great...and the carving station looks better than it tastes because the turkey and roast beef they're carving is usually pretty bone dry. The only time I'd recommend it is when they're carving pork shoulder because that is usually marbled with fat, moist and delicious!  All in all, not a bad buffet, but not the best. But for the price you really can't beat it! It's about 8 bucks for lunch and like 12 for dinner if you have a boarding pass card (you can get 2 discounts per cardmember). And if you gamble and get coupons, it's even cheaper!",

Between my wife and I, we have probably received a few dozen free buffet coupons, so we have seen it through the years and the food has been pretty consistent.

We used to visit Sweet Tomatoes to have a healthy-ish lunch buffet on the weekend but for the same price or less actually we go heere occasionally.   Selection is truly varied and some cuisines are more Americanized than others; my faves are the sushi rolls, the salad area, the Chinese area and carving station. Desserts have been well picked over and just way too American (huge and too sweet) for my tastes at lunch. You are usually presented with cookies, brownies, pies, muffins, ice cream made to look like sorbet, some warm deserts next to a self-serving soft ice cream dispenser. The only desert at lunch I can tolerate are the cookies and occasionally the molten chocolate cake with some vanilla ice cream on top. And nearly all desserts are offered sugar-free for diabetics, too.  At the salad bar, enjoy the quinoa (red), farro (wheat berries), assorted prepared salads, fresh baked bread, sweet cream butter and of course veggies washed and set up for your own salad. I usually eat about two plates of salad before trying sushi rolls or anything heavy.   Also beware that this place is NO SECRET and the lines are long. Have your payment and players card ready to speed things up. Prepare to spend a good hour just waiting to pay then waiting to sit and then roaming to eat...",

    "text": "We end up here more often than I care to admit in public forum. LOL For some reason, our friends, family and visitors love this buffet!  I have to be honest, I actually like it too. No it is not fancy, like some of the strip buffets, but it is a solid, fresh, buffet that has a great assortment of meats, some seafood, etc, like roast beef, ribs, gourmet sausages, shrimp, etc, etc. The better seafood is limited to the weekends, when they charge a bit more.   They have an awesome desert section, with cakes, pies, and a gigantic make your own sundae counter! Even a large sugar free selection.  Let's talk service...Even though it is a buffet, trust me you still want an efficient, friendly person taking care of your table! (Don't forget to throw a little green on the table when you leave!) - I have always found the service here to be top notch!  Friendly, sometimes even funny...in a good way!  Insider tip! If you do not have a Stations Reward card, go get one when you arrive at ANY Stations casino. There are SO MANY benefits to having them! Discounts galore! And it is free!  Breakfast -Mon - Sat  $9.99 - only $6.99 (with rewards card)  Pretty good. a lot of basics, and a lot to choose from.  Lunch -Mon - Sat $11.99 - only $8.99 (with rewards card) This is a scaled down version of dinner.  No complaints.  Dinner -Sun - Thurs $18.99- only $13.99 (with rewards card)  Great selection for dinner, heavier on the proteins and a few more dishes than lunch  The weekends are the busiest time! So they pull it all out! This is when you will see the crab legs, the fancy meats, etc. But it is also when there is usually a LONG line.   Fri & Sat Night Prime Rib/Shrimp $21.99 - only $16.99 (with rewards card)   Sunday Brunch $18.99 -- only $13.99 (with rewards card)   ENJOY!!",

They make all of the dishes in small batches so it comes out fresh and is replenished right away. The salad bar had all kinds of prepared salads, the Red Beat Salad was a favorite of mine. the prepared vegetables were all very good, me saying that is a big deal, I hate vegetables, but here I was a fan. the Prime Rib was very good (for buffet prime rib) There was a wide selection, I am not sure that I got thru everything before I couldn't eat another bite.

The buffet, along with the resort, are just gorgeous with yet a homey feel to it! I recently went back for the breakfast buffet and once again I left very satisfied! You get tired of buffets in Vegas for sure, but if you space them out and stay away from the monster ones on the strip you can appreciate one like Red Rock! The seating is such large comfortable cushion chairs that it beckons you to eat more! The usual breakfast items are there, along with some additions like potato pancakes! The pastries are freshly made and just a delectable array of fresh made donuts! Grab you a free Stations Players Card and enjoy this for just $8! The casino itself lends you to walking around and enjoying the view of a well thought out and gorgeous resort! This southern gentleman always looks forward to his visits to Red Rock!",

Mac-n-cheese, potato latkes, pretty much everything I had was bland.  This place is full of senior citizens. I think we were the youngest diners there. To top if off, one of the senior citizens who was sitting next to me was coughing and talking so loudly. Not that it's the restaurant's fault but it just made my dining experience more terrible.   Their desserts were weak too. The only things I was able to tolerate were some of the salad bar items. I should have gone to Sweet Tomatoes! I've been here for breakfast last year and it was decent for the price. I came here for lunch years ago and remember thinking it wasn't that great.

    "text": "There are certainly a lot of people who think that Red Rock is one of the best local casinos in town and I will admit that it had a lot going for it.   That is, it HAD a lot going for it.   Over the past two years I have watched as this once great Red Rock has slowly soured into a joke that is not at all funny. There seems to be no aspect of this casino that has not deteriorated in quality, with the rare exception of the Yard House (which is not associated with the casino).  But let's keep the focus of this review to the Feast Buffet. I have eaten at the Feast Buffet on a very regular basis for several years, although it had been a few months since I was last there. With some friends in town, it was a good option for a good budget meal, so we went this past Sunday.  First of all, I am supposed to be a VIP of the Station Casinos, with a Presidential status that was earned almost completely at the Red Rock. The President status is supposed to get me a 50% discount on the buffet, but it only amounted to about 25%.   So the Sunday night buffet is $19 per person ($15 after my VIP discount). One would think at those prices, we were about to be pampered with some great food choices.   Boy were we wrong - very wrong.  Let's just sum this all up with a reference that I think we can all relate to - the food quality and choice was what one would expect to find at Sizzler (but of course, at twice the price).   There were less options to choose from than there used to be and what was there was crap, just pure crap. No prime rib, shrimp or crab legs, something they were calling sushi (ha!) and a plentiful collection of some of the cheapest menu items a buffet can offer.   It reminded us of a cattle feed lot, troughs of a food like substance that all tastes the same.  Crap - pure crap!",

It was the biggest CF ever. You stand waiting behind large parties of 6-15. So obviously, those take longer to seat. So here you are, a party of 2 waiting ridiculously long. Why not have 2 lines, one for parties of 4 or less, and one for 6 or more?? Makes perfect sense to me. You'd move things twice as fast.  Now to the food. There were only maybe 25% of the dishes that had signs on them!! You had no idea what the food was, and yes, some was a complete mystery. I'm sorry, but I don't want to take food I might take one bite of and decide I don't like it. There was no reason in the world not to have signage. Also, all of the food was mixed up from one station to the next. You would find cocktail sauce and horseradish in the middle of Thanksgiving food. It's as if they were just throwing stuff out there to fill holes. The service for water, champagne, sodas was extremely slow and tables sat dirty far too long. I don't think there is one good thing I can say about this disaster. STAY AWAY on holidays!!!",

    "text": "I had a MyVegas reward for 2 free lunch or breakfast buffet so we decided to stop in for breakfast before continuing on to Red Rock Canyon.  I began with an assortment of fresh melon, strawberry yogurt and OJ.  My second plate was limited to a Mexican tart topped taco meat and salsa on an inedible base.  I fared better with plate #3 by ordering a thin spinach omelet, though the chef forgot the requested cheese, plus a dollop of corned beef hash and breakfast potatoes.  Plate #4 consisted of a small taste of 2 salads, watermelon/tomato and a very blah, jicama.  Overall I found the room out shined the pedestrian food.",

    "text": "While the Red Rock may be one of my favorite properties, I can't say Feast is one of my favorite buffets. It resembles almost every other Feast in the Station Casino chain, though I think the food options here might be a bit more substantial than the rest. For that reason in addition to the value, this place still gets a thumbs up from me.   Like many buffets at more popular properties, Feast has taken on the concept of offering international variety through stations across its incredibly vast layout. In fact, this is the biggest Feast I've ever seen with a seemingly endless counter of options. It forces patrons to walk decent lengths to get what they want. (#1)  Despite the numerous cuisines, I can't think of one that truly stands out for being outstanding. Ironically, I enjoy coming here for breakfast more than the lunch and dinner hour, but that's just me. During the weekends and holidays, the carving station is pretty impressive as is the dessert + gelato selection. Anything that requires freshly prepared stuff (omelets, pasta, shrimp, etc.) is bound to be halfway decent.  Any of their American preparation is going to look something like a Thanksgiving meal (never a bad thing) and the cold foods, salad section is pretty standard. I particularly love the mini-wedge salads, they're just perfect for the bite sized salad lover. On occasion they'll feature a Mediterranean section, which is decked out in various kinds of hummus and some subpar attempts at a gyro meat.  The only thing I would remove entirely would be the Asian cuisine section. I already though the pizza was an atrocity, but the entire spectrum of Asian food from Dim Sum to Sushi to sad attempts at Canto cuisine are beyond bad. The sushi cuts are terribly done, the seasoning for most of the hot food is way off. I understand the need for this though given the Asian clientele that visit Vegas on a regular basis, but I can't imagine them loving it either.   All in all, the Feast Buffet can execute solid variety without making too much of a dent in the wallet. The lines can get fierce during prime hours, but having a Station players card with status might help with the wait, in addition to saving you a few dollars for each session. The food isn't memorable by any means, but it's far from the worst buffet in Vegas.   ___________ (#1) Laugh it up, but in the Vegas buffet world, that's exercise.",

    "text": "The prices have gone up at the buffet, probably to bring them closer to the upscale Strip-priced places that Red Rock has been rapidly adding to the roster.  The cute little self-contained glasses of wine have been replaced by Barefoot little bottles.  Barefoot isn't a bad brand, but we buy a whole bottle at Suncoast's liquor store on sale for just a buck more.  I wouldn't mind any of this if the buffet had maintained its previous high standards for food and presentation.  Alas, that's gone, too.  And now there's a two-hour limit - stay longer and they'll throw you out.  Our most recent foray was, again, for the Passover additions to the buffet.  Not that we don't eat all the other stuff, too.  But the entire buffet is now a ghost of its former glory.  Many of the holiday offerings - listed on a big cardboard sign in front of the entrance - were nowhere to be found.  Macaroons? Nyet.  Matzo Brei? Nein.  Potato kugel - yes, but totally tasteless.  Also tasteless was the ceviche, California rolls, and almost everything else I tried.  The brisket was pure fat, through and through.  Gelato was not gelato, but the most ordinary Chinese restaurant ice cream you've ever had.  A waitress was present in our section almost the whole time we were there, but she wasn't ours.  Our waitress was apparently out to lunch.  My husband spoke with two managers before we left.  One told him that, yes, there was a new chef.  He also said that before he became a manager, he used to be a customer, and he's noticed the difference, too.  The decline of the Feast Buffet is in line with all the other hellish changes that have taken place at Red Rock over the last year or so.  Put this together with the now 2-star rating for the Hotel and Casino, the removal of all the machines I loved to play, now replaced with glitzy, noisy one-armed bandits that truly are bandits, reduced payouts, reduced offerings for regulars, and you have a place that no longer cares about locals. And locals have fewer and fewer reasons to go.  What's their next move - charging for parking?  It's sad.",

You get what you are paying for (regular price $19.99, player's card price $14.99). The buffet covers 9 different cuisines: Sushi and shrimp, American (mashed potatoes, meatloaf, fried chicken, etc.), BBQ, Italian (pizza & pasta), Mexican (tacos), Asian (the basic Chinese dishes, curry, tom yum soup, etc.), Farmer's market (salad bar, soup, and breads), and International (veggie burgers, humus, falafel), and a small dessert section.   It's better than your average Station casino buffet and I do appreciate the variety. For example they offer tom yum soup in additional to the usual egg drop soup, and Indian curry in the Asian section. The only downfall would be the dessert section. Literally there were only 8 different desserts (various cupcakes, carrot cake, cookies, and sponge cakes), 4 sugar-free cakes, ice cream, and a peach cobbler/bread pudding section. I wasn't impressed at all and majority of them were on the dryer side.   OVERALL: When I'm tired of AYCE sushi and KBBQ I would come here to satisfy my AYCE cravings.",

With the rewards/players card, we paid $19.99 (regularly $24.99). FYI: you can sign up for the card without ever playing in the casino.   This place offers a variety of food but we focused more on the prime rib and sides. Surprisingly, it was well worth the money! The prime rib was medium rare so I asked them to cook it a bit more. It was delicious! I think I ate more than I can handle! Had we gone to a regular restaurant, we probably would've paid more because of the sodas and desserts. On top of that, our server was very friendly and hospitable!   Overall, we were very happy with our decision to eat here. Next time we're in Vegas, we will for sure be eating here again. As a matter of fact, I recommended this place to my friends!  One less star because their dessert was disappointing! There's A LOT to choose from, but for me, none satisfied my sweet tooth. :(",

    "text": "Bad experience. To start, I think it's important to point out that, on several occasions, I've watched guests putting their finger inside of their pants and up into their behind. Then, they go and handle food. That's disgusting. But, that's what you get with buffets,  I guess.   Ok, wow, I hate writing bad reviews but problem after problem...I can't stand when people can't accept fault for a mistake.   President card status is supposed to get line priority.   Not today. Two kids that aren't even old enough to gamble were taken in first. No big deal. I'm just here to eat. That's just to pay.  Then comes the next line, to wait to sit. Two couples again that aren't in the priority line, are taken first. Ok, no big deal. I'm just here to eat.   So, the host is trying to seat me. I know that there's only a small pocket that gets phone service. There were seats available. Since I got ignored twice before even seating, I asked if I could sit in that section. \"No,\" the host responded. \"There aren't any servers to work there.\" Ok, no problem. I'm just here to eat.  Usually, I wait to order my drinks but I'm already having a bad experience and ran to the line to get food. I came back just as another guest was sitting so the server took both of our orders.   \"Can I get 2 tiger woods?\" (BTW, that's my creation. Raspberry iced tea and lemonade.)  Servers have gotten to know this concoction which I'm happy to see and he shook his head and proceeded to take the other guest that was just sitting. That guest ordered a coffee with cream and a coke. Strange but ok...  Server comes back with only one drink for me and all drinks for other guest. Oh well. I can order another, I'm just here to eat.   After returning from getting my second plate, what do you know? A couple is sitting in the section I requested. No biggie. I'm just here to eat.   Then, I realize...the food is dried garbage. Why am I just here to eat again?",

I've been a handful of times or so in the past 2 or so years and I've seen the same consistency.   The prices are 1/3 of what they are on the strip yet the food is still tasty. Don't get me wrong, it's not Bacchanal quality, but it is still quite good! I believe both Saturday and Sundays brunch comes with bottomless mimosas. All told, comes to about $15 a person or so if you present a (free to obtain) Station Casino players card. When I have friends in town and I want to take them somewhere where we can get the Vegas Buffet vibe at a fraction of the cost of the strip casinos, we always go to Red Rock.   I'm relatively critical of food and I can say that they truly will have some options for every palette! Carving station, large salad area, gelato, large dessert area, sushi, Asian, American, Italian, pizza... you really can't go wrong here.   I definitely recommend stopping in! I know I'll be back in the future.",

Every extra spoon of rich food seems to need an extra mile of jugging or 30 extra minutes of gym time! With that said, I find the buffet at Red Rock Casino to be one of the better ones. The quality is pretty high, and there is a lot of variety. I am sure while quality or variety may differ depending on the time of the year you are visiting (quieter times are the best!), it is still up there with the best that Las Vegas buffet world has to offer. So if you feel like indulging yourself, go there, pile up the calories, get in your car, make a left on Charleston Blvd and drive straight to Red Rock Canyon National Preserve where you can hike a few trails and burn a few of the calories you just paid for in Feast Buffet!",

    "text": "This place definitely deserves a solid 4/5. I'd heard that this Feast Buffet is different and better than all the others. Based on my experience, this is absolutely True. I would put this in second place when it comes to buffets that aren't on The Strip (Studio B and Carnival tie for first in my book). This place has a wider selection and better quality than the other Feast Buffets (also better than Alliante).   We went for dinner on MLK around 5:30p and there was quite a line (I hear there always is). It probably took 45 minutes to get a table and another 18 minutes before the waitress took our drink orders.   But on to the important part - the food!  Pork Curry - I certainly haven't seen this before offered at any other casino, not even on The Strip. Not only was it unique, it was also delicious! It was a red sauce, huge chunks of pineapple, had a little spice, but not too much, huge fresh basil leaves and very tender pork. The lo mein noodles were near by and I opted to put those at the bottom of my bowl for fun. Delicious combo!   Fried Chicken - This was actually the best fried chicken I've had here in Vegas (and that includes Yard Bird). It had the perfect amount of crunch, tender and juicy inside and so much flavor!   Tempura Sushi - Ok. Not every buffet offers sushi. So to  see tempura was super exciting! This is another item I haven't seen at any other Vegas buffet. And interestingly enough, they don't offer just one kind - they had a mix of maybe three different rolls! It was delicious with either the soy sauce or the sweet and sour sauce.   Egg Rolls - Pretty decent! Definitely better than a lot of others I've had at buffets.   Pizza - They seemed to offer a nice variety. Not just red sauce, but also one with a tasty white sauce and broccoli!  Taco Station - Props for having a taco station. But obviously nothing compared Bacchanal. I will say that while the carnitas weren't as tender as I would expect, they did have great flavor. The couple other Mexican offerings I tried were only so-so.   Wedge Salad - This reminded me of Wicked Spoon! I have to say it was just as nicely done!  Spumoni Gelato - I've actually never tried this flavor before. For those of you who don't now, its cherry and pistachio ice cream with swirls of chocolate sauce. And this place offers a great version! It was soft and began melting immediately - just the way I like it. The cherry flavor was particularly nice. I recommend topping it with hot fudge and mini '&M's at the topping station. OR, take it a step further - grab a toffee cake, cover it with caramel and then put that scoop of gelato on top. So good!!!  Creme Brulee - Not the best, before t certainly not the worst. Very enjoyable! I was sad that when I went back up for more it was all gone.   S'More Shooter - There is a layer of crumbled Graham cracker on the bottom, a thin layer of chocolate ganache, a thick layer of what tasted like a buttercream icing, a layer of mini marshmallows and then a drizzle of chocolate. Pretty tasty! My only complaint is that I would've preferred a thicker layer of ganache.   Carrot Cake - I truly appreciated that this had just as much icing as it did cake. Seriously, it was a 50/50 ration. This is how all cakes should be.   This is only a short list of compared to all they had available! So many choices!  My only complaints of the evening -   1. Our waitress taking 18 minutes to stop by for a drink order. We saw her pass by several times and completely ignored us trying to wave her down.   2. No spoons at the dessert station. I had to walk to the other end of the buffet to find some by the Asian soups. Life is pretty hard. Lol",

    "text": "I'm sitting around 3.5 stars on this.   Feast is a solid buffet choice. I visited on a Thursday and kept my expectations low, keeping in mind that the options would not include all of the bells and whistles that would come with a weekend visit.   That said, I was here for a holiday party and didn't pay for my meal, so I can't speak to pricing. To be honest, I was so hungry that I didn't even look at prices.   The entire area is well maintained. Despite the fact that almost entire party ventured out for food at the same time, the buffet really only felt crowded at the carving station.   The food selection was good and replenished quickly. To my surprise, the standout items were the tom yum soup and the roasted pork shoulder. The soup was served in individual bowls with mushrooms and shrimp. I was happy to find just a bit of heat (I like more, but I still enjoyed the soup as is). However, the biggest surprise was the roasted pork shoulder on the carving station. It was juicy and tender and even came with a bit of skin. It was so very close to lechon that my pork-loving filipino was a bit giddy on the inside. The carving attendant almost scrapped the skin off of my serving, but I quickly begged for every last morsel. I topped some of the pork with chimichurri sauce that I got from the beef carving station and threw it into a roll from the salad. Needless to say, I went back for seconds on both the soup and pork.  The salad and dessert stations were just okay. Pretty standard.   Service, on the other hand, was great. Everyone was attentive. Plates were cleared and soda/water refills were plentiful.   I don't know if I'll back just because it's out of the way for me, but I enjoyed dinner more than I expected. Can't complain.",

    "text": "Horrible -- I made the decision to go to this location after seeing the photos from other visitors on Yelp, Their food selection seemed appealing but that wasn't the case. I arrived here at 5:30pm and sat on Table 10, The selection at Feast was extremely poor and there was virtually no seafood despite dinner service having just started, No clams/crab, crab-legs, or shrimp.   There was only peeling shrimp at the sushi station, The Asian section was completely full of microwaveable Chinese food ie; egg rolls, noodles, sweet & sour chicken that looked disgusting and not even an 'attempt' to make it appear like the traditional food. As for the dessert station it was a mess, there was a long line and only one guy serving ice cream & pies, Id like to mention that the \"flan\" cups where the single most disgusting thing i ever put in my mouth, whoever thought that was flan has obviously never had it before.   Lastly the service, We only seen the waiter TWICE during the course of an hour and a half; at one point i was extremely thirsty and not a single server in sight. Overall this experience was the worst I've encountered in Vegas if i could get my money-back i honestly would, I came here expecting to leave with a full belly and instead i left disappointed.  A final note i'd like to make, This location may be wheel-chair accessible but the buffet certainly isn't. I visited with a handicap person and they had to reach to the back of the 'warmer' through the glass almost burning their arms to get some food. There is PLENTY of space to setup a different buffet configuration, This is just bad.",

Recently, I met up with Olivia;  not old (as in person) but old school, as in refreshing. Never been to a buffet in Vegas where the Server brought me new utensils. She did. Very gracious, certainly not a Union Employee, which you'd know because she would not have done that. Besides the utensils, Olivia was on top of things the entire meal, as if it was not a buffet but a full serve restaurant.   She didn't just serve coffee and disappear. The Red Rock is probably the best neighborhood place to go. I hope it stays that way.",

The prices at this buffet are very reasonable and you get your money's worth.

It's pretty easy to get one. All you have to do is sign up at the front of the casino and you ta da - boarding pass! :)  There is a lot of selection at this buffet. It's international with different stations dedicated to foods from around the world. They have Japanese (sushi), Mexican (fajitas, quesadillas), Chinese (orange chicken, bao, fried rice), American (mini hamburgers, mac and cheese) and Italian (pizza, pasta). They also have an awesome dessert area (pies, cupcakes, cookies, cannolis, brownies) and a gelato bar! There is so much food, I just can't list it all!  I've been here for Sunday Brunch and lunch and they actually have pretty much the same offerings. Sunday Brunch just has champagne, mimosas, an omelet bar and breakfast goodies like eggs, bacon, sausage, corn beef hash and breakfast sweets like donuts, muffins and croissants.  I tried out the omelet bar when I was here. I got a vegetarian omelet and it was great! It had a good share of different veggies and nicely made.   The gelato bar here is my favorite! Some of the flavors they had were: mint, vanilla, raspberry, caramel, strawberry and spumoni! The spumoni and caramel were  excellent. Sweet and creamy, it's the perfect dessert at lunch or dinner or even breakfast brunch (hehe). Gelato and Vegas, how can you go wrong?  Lots and lots of selection with decent prices! Don't forget to get your boarding pass for even more savings! :)",

    "text": "Why didn't we try out this place sooner?! $8.99pp for a weekday lunch is a steal! Many of the other Station Casinos are the same price for lunch, but the quality, service, and decor are far better here than any of the others. Good thing it's close to our house; this is our new spot!  The line was pretty short at 11:30 but still moved pretty slow. However once we got past the cashiers we were seated promptly.  Lots of choices here! Let's start from the very left:  Sushi This buffet is the only Station Casino that serves sushi for lunch (however I haven't been to Green Valley yet so don't know about that one). These are basic maki rolls, but were pretty well done. Philly roll, spicy tuna, CA roll, shrimp tempura, veggie, inside out CA w masago. Everything was decent except the shrimp tempura which was soggy for obvious reasons. There was also a shrimp ceviche dish next to the sushi which was made of bay shrimp (no veins in them, nor were they overcooked or powdery), cucumber, avocado, tomato. I went back for thirds on this.  Mexican All the Feast buffets have Mexican food and this one was no exception. My faves are the menudo (not too oily or salty) and chile verde. There's also sopes, enchiladas, make-your-own-fake-tacos, and a good condiment bar with thick guacomole, crema, and all the other toppings you'd need. Also they have street corn!  Chinese Your basic Chinese-American fare here, but my fave was the mini bbq pork buns (cha shu bao) which were not overly sweet like they usually are in buffets. Other dishes were egg rolls, chinese broccoli w oyster sauce, tom yum soup (very good with actual shrimp in there), hot and sour soup, egg drop soup. And next to the Chinese food is the Chinese condiments, including super hot Chinese mustard! Yay! I didn't care for the curry chicken in this section. I didn't taste any curry flavor at all. Though the meat was juicy and well cooked.  BBQ/American While these sections were separate from each other, I didn't eat much from here since I am staying away from red meat and carbs, but bf had lots from here and most of it was pretty good. Carving station had ham, turkey, and two kinds of sausages. Also had mashed potatoes, grilled talapia, grilled veggies, bbq chicken, etc.  Italian Lots of pizza, garlic bread and pasta here. Again I didn't try any but looked really good. I did have some of the antipasto at the right end of this section. Salami, olives, etc. Yum!  Salad bar Don't miss out on this. It's not just your regular old salad bar. They had this great frisse salad with strawberry and candied walnuts (I got seconds). Pickled beets which I had with bleu cheese, farro salad, tuna salad, egg salad, caprese salad, so many more I'm sure I'm forgetting, and of course the make your own salad part. Also plenty of cut fruit; cantaloupe, honeydew, etc, not just the canned peaches and pears in heavy syrup.  Dessert We just shared a tiny soft serve cone, but if you want pies, they got them here! Pumpkin, lemon meringue, cheesecake, etc. Plus donut holes, brownies, bread pudding, AND regular scooped ice cream in addition to the soft serve. Only thing missing was cream puffs and eclairs.  Will definitely return!",

Very inexpensive compared to most other high end buffets.   Extra discounts with players cards make it darn cheap esp for lunch!  Today was amazing. The new beef stew offering is just \"stop the presses\" type delicious.   The ingredient qualities of the various dishes I had today were great and super fresh.   Chinese broccoli was perfectly prepared, and the chicken at the carving station was super moist and very flavorful.   Best buffet i have ever enjoyed at red rock- not sure if there have been any staff or supplier changes, but this was fabulous today!!!!!  And the cherry on top was lunch at 12:30 had no line today!   Keep it up!",

This is not a problem because The Red Rock Casino is beautiful open airy and clean! I was thrilled that I did not have to wade through a thick cloud of smoke or stale smells in order to get to The Feast Buffet.  The food was fresh and presented in an appetizing way (as apposed to just put out in a cafeteria style.)  I was very happy with the Sushi bar.  Although it was not extensive it was FRESH and the slices of salmon were THICK! The sushi rolls were also tasty.  My husband enjoyed the prime rib, which they offered to put his slice on the grill to cook it more if that was what he preferred, which he did.   The Salad Bar had a large variety of mixed green salads, and pasta salads and fruits~ all at the appropriate temperatures.   The deserts were also delicious! I was happy to discover that even the sugar free deserts were yummy, with the right texture, as apposed to dry or \"tough.\"    We ate there on January 18, 2016.  We will go back next time we are in town.",

    "text": "If you came to Vegas looking for a buffet, this is a good one. One of my favorite things about it is that it is located at a great property, the Red Rock Resort. This is a relatively new, well-maintained and modern resort in Vegas.  With a Players Card, you get a substantial discount, around $6-8 dollars depending on when you go. That brings the buffet into very reasonable price territory. (And since a buffet really is a hunt for value, you care about this, right?)  The line begins about 30 minutes before each meal begins. Earlier if there is a special going on. The seating is all relatively close to the buffet, which is another important aspect of your \"stuffing\" strategy.   The buffet has several prep stations, where you can request food made to order. The chefs seemed very pleasant and willing to help you get what you wanted. There were at least 7 different stations, and even for a weekend dinner, there were never really lines to get anything. That's a huge plus at a place like this.  My favorite part: The Dessert Bar was surprisingly well-appointed for an AYCE, which was great. They had several very good flavors of gelato, which I loved.  Only downside: The seafood, and especially the sushi, were not that great. Pretty typical for a place like this, but I had hoped for better.",

Once we were seated, we (myself, wife and two daughters under the age of ten) ordered our drinks. Once drinks were ordered the ladies were off to get their food. The older of the kids said that she wanted Asian food for lunch. I don't care for Asian so we decided on a Buffet. We decided to eat here inside the Red Rock Hotel, Spa, and Casino.   The girls soon returned with their egg rolls and noodles. the younger also had a slice of pizza along with macaroni and cheese on her plate.   Myself, I first went to the salad bar. I did not find any sliced carrots at the salad bar. SHOCKING ! I found the bacon bits over in the barbecue station. Ohh barbecue. Since I am at the barbecue station let's fill up my plate.  We were seated in the very southwest corner of the dining area. For my second plate I wanted some green chili verdi, so I walked all the way to the northeast corner of the buffet stations. Not a quick walk. But worth it.  The reason for only 4 stars, service was slow. Between trips to and from the buffet I had to ask my server for a refill of soda twice. Which to me is a pet peeve when going out to eat.   Bottom line this is what you do in Las Vegas when you can't decide on what style of food you want. BUFFET! The one's on the strip are okay, and I will post reviews on them, but Red Rock Casino has 1 of my 3 favorites. It's on the very west side of town and worth the effort to get there.",

    "text": "I, myself, am shocked at how my POV on Feast Buffet has changed!  From 2 to 4 stars...how does such a thing happen over the course of half a year??  Let me first say that this is a decent buffet, nothing more.  I think my expectations are at the right level for this place.  When ever I go to a buffet, I have this compulsion to eat everything and stuff myself because that's just what \"buffet\" means to me - eat until you feel so incredibly uncomfortable doing anything, even sitting.   One of the reasons why I keep coming here is because my friend gets 2-for-1 buffet coupons in the mail, via the Player's Card.  A nice saving.  When using that 2-for-1 coupon for Saturday breakfast ($7.99) @10am and stay until brunch is served = even bigger savings.  I get breakfast and brunch for $4, flippin sweet deal.  At that price, I can eat decent food quality any time.    Typical buffet options: sushi, Mexican, pizza, Asian.  Fresh fruit, bagels w/ 3 spread options (regular, strawberry, chive + onion).  They have self serve frozen yogurt, gelato (cup or cone) and an assortment of pies.   Recommended dishes: - chocolate croissant: hit or miss, sometimes they have it - chocolate pancake - cornbread: surprisingly good, not too bland, hint of sweetness - pork bun: nice size, 2 bites and you're done  TIP for you: get a players card & gamble a lil bit to get those food coupons",

We wanted to sit near each other because we barely see each other, but there was a 15% gratuity fee if we wanted to sit even NEAR each other. I understand if we all paid in one and wanted to push some tables together, then a gratuity fee is somewhat understandable. But as we were entering, the hosts were talking on the radio about our family and ended up separating us in different parts of the restaurant! They could've just simply put us in the same area.   The highlight of the night was our waiter, John. He makes sure we have enough napkins and everything is taken care of. He is pretty much the only reason why we were to enjoy our dinner.   In short. Way to be discreet about your absurd \"policy\" of not seating family close to each other. But great job John for making my family's night.",

She kept saying \"Well you have to wait to be seated.\"  I told her how would I know that?  There was nobody there and no sign.  She rudely responded that there is a sign and she's \"just telling me the rules.\"  No she wasn't.  She was scolding me as her coworker was.  I have never been treated like that anywhere.

    "text": "Staying in Summerlin for the weekend we wanted to try out this place. Heard it had been voted best buffet in Vegas, so that must mean something. We first went on Saturday around noon, but the line to get in was so long we turned around and left. Must be good, right? Returned for a second try on Sunday and the wait was minimal so we stayed.   Reading some of the reviews we had high expectations. Sadly they were not met. First, we were seated one table away from the shoulder height partition between the casino floor and the restaurant. Basically, we were seated in the smoking section. The place was busy, so asking for another table was out of the question. We had already paid so we decided to stay.   The waitress who helped us with beverages was super helpful and friendly. No complaints there and we left a nice tip.    The expectations we had around the food were not met. As vegetarians there are usually limited options, but most buffets now try hard to meet those needs. Here, not so much. Aside of tofu, omelette and mashed potatoes I could find nothing to eat on the buffet that met my vegetarian needs. The salad bar was basic (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrot and olive stuff). Other items I could eat were some rolls and cheese.   Many reviewers had mentioned the amazing dessert station and gelato to die for. I may have missed something. That station was far from amazing and by far one of the smallest dessert stations at a buffet I have ever experienced. It was pretty standard buffet stuff and the gelato was like any other out there.  Perhaps our expectations were too high for this buffet. This was perhaps on par with any buffet found at Native American casinos around the country. For Las Vegas, we were a little puzzled by the \"best of 2015\" award.",

You just give em an i.d. they take your name down correctly and you get a discount. Sometimes they'll send you promos.   They have good shrimp and sushi, I love it wth cocktail sauce. I also like the Chinese food but the orange chicken is over cooked. I come here all the time and its always like that. The inside will be very dry almost hard. Aside from that i have no problem with the food here. There's certain things you can tell they don't put any thought or effort into. They could use some lasagna for Italian place or calzones.   The deserts part is filled with cookies and cake, pies, gelato and ice creams. All great choices. I like the chocolate creme pie. I hadn't had one in so long i too picture of it. There's also blueberry pie, i believe. You have to ask for these to be served or they are right in the back.   For breakfast here is really delicious. It's average but its a very nice meal. They have all the works as well. I love the creme rolls kind of like a crepe but they're rolls. That with strawberry sauce is yummy.  Unlike ALL buffets I've been too, I can definitely tell this is one of the more cleaner ones. I mean superbly clean. I don't see any inconsistencies. It looks very good and sanitized. That's why I give it a 5 star. I really appreciate this place for that.  I wouldn't come for the prime rib and shrimp night. Its a bit pricier and almost the exact same food. Except for prime rib.

    "text": "Here is a different kind of buffet review, and the sort I never thought I'd write. I avoid these places like the plague. FB and RRCasino, though, they did me right. Read along for healthy insights and Pro Elite Tips (PETTM).   In my three years of visiting and now living in Las Vegas, I had been to two buffets, and Excalibur's was the second, miserable, and last some 36 months ago.  Or so I thought.  But I have taken up sports gambling the past two weeks, went bowling with friends at RedRock a few times, enjoy and have been racking up points on my Station card, and like to get my complimentary Starbucks coffee on Station's Military Mondays. Military Monday's also includes a 2-for-1 (or 50% for a single) deal at their buffet. How could I resist, for about $6? It is my patriotic duty to experiment and attest, so here we are.   My goal: eat breakfast or lunch for cheap, and see how *healthy* I could buffet since I've been on a solid-but-not-depraved health kick for awhile. Is it possible to not be ruined by buffet, but to have it fit your fitness goals? The answer is a solid Yes. RedRock's buffet allows you to. It practically encourages you to. Thanks, buffet coach!  I had numerous greens of all shapes and sizes and preparation styles. Salad and quinoa. Whole squash roasted on a grill. Sauteed mushrooms. I had fish, both cooked salmon and sashimi.  I had a mountain of turkey, cut right in front of me. Their three-bean salad was on point. There was cottage cheese for you protein hounds.   Service was excellent, though hurried because of the holiday crowd. After stating that I was a buffet virgin, my waitress informed me of how to enjoy and to signal her for drinks or that I was done dining. She was sweet. Folks, tip your buffet waitstaff. I had my own carafe of coffee. Oh boy! The atmosphere is nice for a buffet, too. The lighting is soft, design is almost upscale, and the area is open so nothing feels too cramped, even when I had babies and families all around me.   And last, dessert.  I did *try* to keep things healthy, but again, I feel obligated to sample and report to eager readers. I had three scoops of gelato: mint, coffee, and chocolate. They have several others. The mint left something to be desired, but the choco and coffee were dandy. I tried two pie slices, which are presented whole in an easy-to-view case. The lemon merengue was a bit too tart, but I was impressed with its toasted-top appearance. The chocolate cream pie was quite good, though a bit light on the chocolate and heavy on a somewhat gummy crust.   All this worked so well into my weekly diet that I am making it a point to go every Monday now. It fits the budget easily, and I max out my macros and other nutrients in no time.  Give it a shot. Dollar-for-product, it's a steal.    **The PET are short and sweet, and I would hope intuitive for the average diner: 1 - don't go on a holiday and expect this place to be empty. I mean...come on. It will be packed, and loafers will lounge and take up space forever, and waitstaff will be ever-busy. Don't be surprised by this. 2 - For AYCE, the price is right to begin with considering what they offer, but take advantage of various discounts, especially for veterans.   3 - You can absolutely eat a pile of healthy food here and feel good about going buffet; choices were better than many garbage dedicated vegetarian spots in this city.",

This buffet is located inside Red Rock Casino in Summerlin off of the strip. Best prices in town for how much food there is! $11.99 lunch price for boarding pass referred, which is the casinos players card. $10.99 for kids under 10 yrs. The food was all fresh. I really enjoyed the chicken chili and turkey meatloaf!! We will definitely be back again!!",

It's a beautiful property, and I go frequently to the bowling and the movies. As far as the buffet there were fruit flies around the dining area (another customer complained and asked for the manager). The food seemed old so it was hard to eat most of it,  and the drink fountain was down so all we could get to drink was apple or orange juice. I've been to this buffet occassionally over the years since it opened,  but I've never had such a bad experience like I did on Thursday. It was horrible.",

The place was really busy but we did not wait too long for a table after paying.  Because it was Sunday brunch, it was a mix of breakfast and lunch foods.  I tried quite a few different items.  Honey walnut shrimp (tasty but no walnuts), egg roll (yum), bacon (super crispy and tasty), Hawaiian pizza (decent flavor), the salad bar (love all the veggies options) and probably a few other things.  I also had the vanilla frozen yogurt (my favorite with rainbow sprinkles and nuts) and carrot cake (not very carrot cake like but had a good vanilla flavor).    So overall a good meal especially when you don't have to pay (mom had a food coupon).  You don't feel like you need to stuff yourself when its free.",

The last time we went the food was awful. The food quality has really gone down hill. I really enjoy prime rib med rare but the meat has been more than rare that I have ever had before. The Chef asks if you would like them to throw on  the grill and of course I say yes each time. But another problem is there is no flavor and it's dry.  For the chow mein either it's burnt or has no flavor like most of their items now.  Everything that has wheat like pizza and rolls are hard. I can give a whole list of items that need major improvements . Unfortunately we will not be returning to this buffet until we know the food quality is much better. We know it could be better. The only good thing is the staff. Waiter are always nice and attentive.",

Yesterday (Sun.) we went at 5:00 for dinner & there was only a small line.  It appeared our server was totally new to this, forgetting one thing after another, leaving out straws, & bringing tea instead of coffee.  We sat near the salad bar which is usually fresh, varied & delicious.  But now the tomato bisque tasted exactly like pasta sauce & other choices of soups were like an afterthought.  Name tags on various items were missing.  The Asian food is so redundant, & the curry made up of chicken bones isn't to everyone's taste.  Why not give us more variety?  What is it about FISH they don't understand?  It is always bland sameness & not creative.  And could we have something NEW in the Italian section?  How about a different pizza chef?  This stuff tastes like the frozen kind, with a very bland Mozzarella & is missing any spices like oregano, basil, fennel seeds.  Ah, desserts!  Whatever happened to the No Sugar Added pies?  That lemon meringue was out of this world.  Yesterday you were missing some gelato flavors, & that new \"beignet\" stuffed w/chocolate?  I don't think so.    More particularly, the Red Rock buffet is outdated, the tables are too close together; it has no \"ambiance\" or pulse.  After dining at the Palms buffet,  I think you might use it as an example & put some money into this one.  In the meantime, we'll take a pass.",

    "text": "This review is based off of lunch time.  Food 3/5 The food items that I grabbed were pretty tasty, fried rice was good and the sweet and sour pork was great too. There were some items though that were off putting some of the soups looked a little funky and the sauce next to the fried rice was down right scary. The sauces and the soups made me think that they were sitting for a very long time.   Service - The table was kept clear and drinks were refilled without having to speak up, so that's good for a buffet.  Parking - Multi story parking garage with a short walk through the casino   All in all this was a decent buffet if you factor in the price of $10.99 per person if you have a rewards card which you can sign up pretty quickly. If we paid full $15.99 per person I'd honestly say to skip this place.",

The sushi/sashimi looks frozen/not fresh at all, the salmon was disgusting, and eh, well, everything just kind of looked college cafeteria like... The only things I found decent were the turkey (carved), hummus and cherry tomatoes so I loaded up on those. I will definitely NEVER come back to this place, not quite the feast I'd ever want to eat again.",

They have Asian, Mexican, salad/soup, and Italian sections, you could order your personalized pasta in the Italian section, which is pretty good and fresh. The dessert section is so small with limited options. I would ignore going on holidays, because it'll take you max 2 hours to get in. The most annoying part about this buffet is the waiting line, which is ridiculous with all the open tables they have, I don't understand how hard it is for them to clean the tables and let people in!",

Best breakfast in the casino imo. The servers are great. There's a selection of pastries including a variety of donuts, but I behaved myself and stayed away.  There is oatmeal, grits, and cream of wheat. French toast, pancakes, and waffles. If you want tacos for breakfast they have that option too. Plenty of fruit for those who are trying to be healthy. They have bagels and a couple different cream cheese options but I did not see lox. Some of my favorite items were the breakfast pizza (tho they had regular pizza too) the hash browns and the mini chocolate chip waffles. Those were nice and crisp on the outside but soft and delicious on the inside. Coffee is decent and you get your own pot. Several juice options; I got apple.",

By the time I got to Red Rocks, I was very hungry.  I decided on the Buffet.  I always \"walk\" a buffet before I settle on my choices.  For my main entrees, I chose the roasted pork and turkey breast and with all the sides.  The turkey was fantastic, however, the pork roast was out-of-this-world.  The pork was flavorful, and very moist.  I liked it so much, I had to plan on seconds, which I did.  The sides were great, and so was the dessert bar; creme brulee, carrot cake, and chocolate cake, were a great way to end the meal and the adventure.  My server was Tony, he was extremely helpful and courteous. He introduced himself, and asked my name, from that point he always addressed me by my name as he checked on me.  When I got home and settled in, I called the casino, asked to be transferred to the chef's office, and complemented the chef and hopefully she passed on the compliment to her staff.  They were all great, the casino has to be proud of their restaurant staff.  They were all fantastic.  Thank you to the buffet restaurant chef and her staff.  I look forward to may next visit.",

It was 10:45 am and they charged us the breakfast fee which was $7.49 with boarding pass (each boarding pass will give a discount for two people). The drinks are included. Heck yes. What a deal! Five more minutes of waiting till we were seated.  Because of our impeccable timing, we paid the cheaper price and were able to get the best of both worlds. Although not many breakfast items were left, we were still able to enjoy waffles, French toast, bacon and some other breakfast items in addition to the lunch menu. Perhaps coming a bit earlier would have resulted in an even larger selection of goodies from both the breakfast and lunch menus! Plan your visit accordingly!  The sushi line had to be the biggest disappointment as there were only a few assortment of rolls and some Japanese flavored vegetables. By far the best line was the BBQ line which included things like roasted turkey, baked potatoes, chili and cheese, and corn bread! Other lines included Asian, Italian, farmer's market and American.  If you have a sweet tooth, that tooth is sure to rot with all the goodies in the dessert section! Thank goodness my boyfriend is in dental school because I went wild! The banana cream pie had to be my favorite. The selection included ice cream mixed to your liking with your choice of cone and all kinds of pastries!   The food isn't top of the line but they have a great variety for such an amazing value. With all the money you save, you can hit the pai gow tables ($10 min bets at the casino during the early afternoon)! If you're a black jack type of person, they have $5 min bets during lunch time as well!  My best advice is to get there right when breakfast is about to end and lunch starts so you can get a good variety. Enjoy!",

    "text": "This is a review of their weekday lunch buffet.   The Skinny: so-so savory dishes with pretty bad dessert offerings,  the salad bar was highly picked over(2) service: pretty good for a buffet (4) value: inexpensive and dirt cheap if you factor in plentiful BOGO coupons but worth 1 hour wait in line? No. (2)  We have been trying to hit Feast buffet at least 4-5 times to take advantage of a BOGO promotion which was valid between Monday through Thursday. Each time we turned around because the lines were ridiculously long.   Finally we go online and see that hey! Feast is no longer continously open like it used to be.  They shut down the lines between breakfast/lunch/dinner; 15 minutes between breakfast and lunch and 1 hour between between lunch and dinner. They are pretty serious about it too. We exited the buffet at 3pm and the line was completely shut down. No one was in line.  All this explains why when we'd get there at like 4pm, there would be a massive line of people waiting for the buffet to open. Insane.   In addition, nearly everyone in line had either a complimentary buffet coupon or a BOGO coupon. I guess we're not the only ones with the same idea.   Given that the buffet is comped to hell,  the line gets pretty long. We got in line at 1pm and didn't get seated until 2pm on a Thursday afternoon. One can only imagine what it is like on weekends.   Once we get in,  the hubs hit the buffet right away (he didn't have anything to eat all day) while I waited for the server to order drinks. Our server was pretty on the ball and got to our table pretty quick. She cleared our plates and refilled our drinks promptly. FYI -  drinks included Pepsi products, juices (pretty generic tasting but all the flavors that one can mix alcohol with including grapefruit and cranberry),  coffee and tea.   In terms of lunch time buffet, the offerings were okay.  The salad bar was really picked over which was a huge disappointment. They had bowls of plain greens (spring mix,  romaine, iceberg),  standard toppings (carrots,  beets, chickpeas,  croutons,  cucumbers,  etc... No eggs though),  a few sad bowls of marinated salads and cold pasta that were half/nearly empty. They did not have charcuterie or any cold cuts. It looked like they did have some Mediterranean cold dishes like hummus but that was literally meant scrapping the the bottom of the dish. Had half the salad buffet just sitting empty (piles of ice) with no refills during the hour we were there. Fruit consisted of fresh melon, pineapple, and  watermelon. Plus some canned peaches and pears.   They did have some soups. The hubs tried the tomato bisque which was the best thing at the buffet in his opinion. He also said the tomato bisque I make at home tastes better.   Lean protein wise, they offered roasted turkey (a bit dry and a little salty), chicken (okay,  Costco chicken tasted better),  sausage (salty) and pork loin (okay). The chimichurri was solid and made up for the dryness of the meat. They also had a bowl of barbecued chicken legs which were nothing special. The only real beef (I do not count ground beef) was a some tri-tip swimming in a grayish brown soupy mess with some sparse mushrooms in there. It looked scary enough that I did not partake.   Sides wise,  they had your standard creamed spinach,  corn, greens,  mac and cheese, potatoes, and a few types of beans.   In terms of ethnic food,  they had Asian, Italian and international stations.   The Asian station looked pretty awful. The steamed charsiu bao were piled on top of each other in one soggy mess. Their vegetables,  chow mein,  sweet and sour pork,  spring rolls made Panda Express look like Michelin star cuisine. Yeah,  they also had sushi but it looked pretty funky and prepared in massive platters. That = disaster in the making.   Tried their sopes in the Mexican station which were impossible to eat given how hard they were. Skipped the generic taco kit offerings which were potential Taco bell in quality.   The stromboli from the Italian station and it was too salty and doughy.  Ruined my appetite to try anything else.   Dessert was a huge miss for me. Nothing looked particularly appetizing especially the ice cream/gelati. Give me store bought Talenti any day over what they had there. I tried one slice of lemon meringue pie which I took one bite of before I stopped. It tasted way too sweet and artificial. After that I stuck with fruit.   Although the service was good,  you can't overlook the fact that the food ain't that great. The variety is there but the quality certainly isn't. Yeah,  it's cheap but time is worth a lot too. Definitely not worth a one hour wait. (2 starred review)",

The resort is first class and elegant in a cutting edge way and you can park right next to it. The buffet is different from other buffets in it's:  1: Half the price of a strip buffet - expect $ with a generous tip. 2: Food is scrumptious and hot regardless of when you visit. No leftovers or stale items. 3: SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING 4: Wide selection of food categories. Asian is very good. Dim sum and sushi! 5: The desert area is to die for. Great ice creams, pies and specialty items - worth three trips. Diet later!  Highly recommended!",

So we had the best of both worlds, eggs, snausages and bacon, biscuits and gravy all delicious.  Lunch options were even better.   mmmm creamy Mac n Cheese to boot.  They have so many different stations (no pun intended) that it's difficult to choose.   We were impressed with the competent service regarding clearing dishes, the fresh food items and over all experience.  The decor is tasteful too.  Love their gelato selection and the lemon sorbet rocked.  Red Rock Feast Buffet gets 2 thumbs up and we'll be back.  I made a pig out of myself so a nap was in order when I got home, but isn't that what buffets are meant to do?  4 1/2 stars, I would give 5 however my friend asked for a sierra mist and it never came :( easily forgiven.",

Especially liked their salad bar area with many great healthy choices. Recommend the lobster ravioli freshly made and roasted Turkey was juicy and tender. Dessert options were many and gelato was wonderful. Servers were good and quick to clear your plate or to offer refills. Have eaten at this buffet many times. Worth the 20 minute drive from the strip. A great value with quality food offerrings. Get their free gaming card first to get a $4 discount off the regular price.",

    "text": "First of all, kudos to the cooks here. Just about everything here from Asian, to Mexican, to Italian and especially the desserts are excellent here. I've been here previously for lunch, and yes that was excellent too. This Feast Buffet is basically the best out of all of the Station Casinos. Thus, I came here with the Family and even though I paid $13.99 for each kid who ate your one taco, one pizza, and one ice cream, the food was still excellent.   So why am I giving this place two stars for tonight's meal? Well, I have to say getting in to this place at 6:30 was a cattle call. I don't mind staying in line but what I do mind is the treatment of people like me, who was totally neglected as a paying customer.   In case you don't know, there are two lines. One is the president's club, which I don't belong to this 1% and the everyone else's auntie and uncle's line for the other. What I didn't appreciate tonight was a series of events:  I didn't appreciate one of the ladies in red shirts (who apparently walks around and enroll you in station rewards card) took people out of no where and walked them in front of us. Granted I don't know who they are and I don't assume, it irked me a little.   2nd, there was a lady 3 person ahead of us, who then called her whole family of six over and they walked into the president's line and of course in front of us. But not only that, these family were tall, like 6 feet tall and had a stroller and while waiting by the wall, the cashiers couldn't see us. Why? Because we were in the furthest line away from sight. After standing for 10 minutes, I made it known that we were waiting and the cashier told me they were waiting for the line to die down. In the meantime, that same cashier took in the people in the President's line for another 5 minutes.   You try waiting with tall people, in a cramped hot area. Guess what? That irked me a little more.  And when it was finally time to be rung up (almost an hour later), the same hostess asked us 3 times how many were in our party. I'm not sure if I was tired or hungry, but I was already more than irritated.  Not to mention that the sushi selection looked broken with hardly any out, they didn't replenish the 2nd time I went back. (That or it must've been the best thing there)  Normally, some hot food and great service would solve the problem. I'm not sure, but even though I ate everything (BTW, fresh pineapples was excellent, orange chicken was excellent, the lemon sorbet and creme brulee was just delicious.), nothing made my night any better. I thought I would tell the situation to someone but I would sound like a total bitch whining about the above right?   Well, I decided to write about it and have you see this experience for yourself. I've been here for lunch and the wait bearable. Hence, that's why I came back and took the whole family. Unfortunately, maybe it was not meant to be and I caution you from coming here during peak hours for dinner like me.",

Bottomless mimosas if your a drinker. The only thing that was good was general tsao chicken in the Asian section. Thy had the typical fair bacon eggs omelet station. I wasn't gonna get an omelet that would have filled up. The sushi section looked like shit, but my rule is never eat sushi at a buffet they pre make it and bring it out of the fridge yuck. I paid over $16 for a lousy brunch. But in all due respects it's fairly cheap compared to a strip casino and for the price I guess it's decent if you want to load up in breakfast food   Oh I forgot the gelato was decent.",

    "text": "3.5 stars-My favorite Feast Buffet:      The Red Rock Feast Buffet is my favorite Station Casinos Buffet. It has consistently been very good without achieving the level of outstanding. Today, when I made it my post - hike supper; it was one more positive experience.      Station Casinos might be genuine when they advertise they love locals. They sent this local a booklet with a half - off cupoun for any Feast buffet. I planned ahead to Saturday nights when Station doubles their price for the gimmicky prime rib & shrimp night. Station Casino's love for locals reduced a $17.99 dinner to less than $10. Lol, I would regain all the calories that I lost from hiking the Red Rock hills bordering Blue Diamond.     From experience, I recommend arriving to the Feast Buffet before 5:00 pm. After, the long lines seem to appear. When I arrived, the line was short. However, it seemed to move like molasses.       This Feast Buffet represents a wide assortment of food in food stations featuring sushi, Mexican, barbecue, International, Asian, American, Italian, pastries, and salad bar. If I am not mistaken, this is the only Feast Buffet to feature sushi (I have to check GVR again ). Each station offers a nice variety of food. Some examples:  Asian: Asian ribs, fried rice, Singapore noodles, wonton soup, orega chicken, stir fry, lo mein, spicy tufu, Spring rolls, etc.  Sushi: peal & eat shrimp, assorted sushi, ginger, & mussel salad.  American: Live cooking station of prime rib, chicken, and turkey. Plus meatloaf, cabbage, mash potatoes, fried chicken, etc.  Italian: pizza, meatballs, sausage, chicken pesto, etc.  Pastries: full service ice cream. Plus cheesecake, German chocolate cake, cream puffs, raspberry poulade, cookies, sugar free desserts, etc.     In recent times my buffet station of choice is Asian foods. However, when sushi is offered it is my station of choice. I filled up on assorted sushi which appeared to be varieties of California rolls. My complaint is that they don't name many of the items. It was good at the same time that it wasn't close to the excellence of Yummy Sushi. Sushi and Asian foods represented my plates. I filled up on stir fry, wonton soup, and this no name soup that is below in a picture. The wonton soup was good, and I appreciated that they never ran out like they do at Sunset Station; yet it fell short of the great wonton soup that Cravings and Carnival World Buffet have served me. To conclude my meal, I drank coffee with raspberry poulade.     This very Feast Buffet is my favorite of them. The deal is that this meal is usually $20 after tax. They use the prime rib & shrimp gimmick to increase the price on a night that many people go out to eat. From experience nearly every buffet includes prime rib. When I think shrimp night, my mind has visions of broiled shrimp, stuffed shrimp, shrimp cocktails, shrimp scampi, and pealed shrimp. The only shrimp I laid eyes on here was the peal & eat shrimp. This is ordinary buffet food that I recently had during lunch in the Gold Coast Buffet. The upshot is that this gimmick is prevents me from rating it 4 stars. In conclusion, this is my favorite Feast Buffet.",

We had Mimosa's.Seafood eaters would be disappointed that there is only a shrimp dish. Not much Mediterranean items.... I kinda see the buffet as a brief summary of food styles. Salad options were boring. Not a lot of meat dishes compared to other places. Highlights include the multitude of Fruit Pies and Gelato flavors. Ok for the price but definitely not a return for me.

Pancakes and waffles both felt and tasted like they had been sittin in a hot oven since they opened. The eggs didn't feel like full real eggs maybe they mix powdered eggs in with the real or maybe the eggs had just been sitting there too long. I ended up eatin just a plateful of French toast with the crispy bacon across the top. My other half ate biscuits and gravy with sausage link. It wasn't so much the price but the distance we drove to try this place out. That wasn't worth it, even an employee was surprised we came for the buffet.

Was a bit of a bummer. I had heard raves for this place and it ceased to wow me.   What little breakfast I did have (chicken and waffles, yum!) was delicious. I also added on the bottomless mimosas which is a must have if you come here for brunch as it is totally worth the extra! They of course had a very large variety of food to please everyone in your party. The only things that really stood out past my breakfast item was the chicken noodle soup and hazelnut gelato. Both were the saving grace of my visit.   I will say the service staff was attentive and filled our mimosas often so that was much appreciated. As far as buffets in Vegas go this one was average.",

Next the food is mediocre at best as it has some stuff blan food that isn't award-winning.  Overall, it's a station buffet (this is supposed to be there best buffet ) but I believe its a 2 star rating.  Lastly the cashier Maria is not a friendly cashier who doesn't understand about discounts, nor accommodating guest.   Also, the othet cashiers hardly  care to work as they continually run off.  Overall, avoid this buffet if you can!!",

The buffet was regularly about $22 but if you sign up for a player's card it's $5 off. I appreciated the fact that the cashier told me about that before I paid. The downside is a three year old is $17.     The barbecue area at delicious prime rib. There are cuddle within book expected in a cafe. The Jerk Chicken was delicious. The pot stickers are also very good. The shrimp for small and seem to be a little old. My girl still had a fun time killing the shells and pulling legs up. The tomato basil soup was fantastic.  My wife said that the pizza was good.  She also said the salad bar was good and had a lot of variety.  The sushi was also really good and tasted very fresh.  Unfortunately they only offered Pepsi products. The other downside we felt like was the dessert bar.   And believe me, we tried about everything they had over there between us.  The Highlight was the gelato. The Spumoni was delicious.",

Yes the prime rib was actually really great. And the price for Vegas is right there in the midrange but for midrance food the quality is better. Some shrimp. Respectable size, not the itty bitty kind. An okay selection at the dessert bar, gelato bar, same.  Service staff attentive and at the ready when needed. My only gripe was that I found it weird that they have plastic glasses. It just seemed cheap to me. I mean I'm not asking for stemware but geez.  Anyway, no crab legs, but it's all pretty good. Good atmosphere. Even though you have to drive a bit out there to get there. Worth a look. Maybe not a return trip, but whatevs. It's nice in there as well as the casino. And you could always find security biking around in there. A good sign.",

I felt that the quality of the food was not that great. I was excited to try the different rice dishes, but to my dismay, they were all hard. There was too much meat that wasn't delicious (skipped the long line for the carving station) and not enough seafood. Their sushi consists of a huge ball of rice with a thin sliver of salmon covered on top. I only liked the desserts section, where the gelato and cheesecakes were my favorites. I was happy that they had cannoli and that was delicious. It probably wouldn't be worth waiting in a long line to be disappointed overall. I also didn't appreciate mislabeled dishes. I like to know the names of the dishes I'm trying. Service was fair, and our dishes were cleared out fairly frequently.",

This kind of pissed me off the way they displayed it but have a small note card barely readable until up close with prices.

    "text": "Over the years I've sampled my fair share of the breakfast buffets in Las Vegas.  I used to bank on the fabulous eats at the Paris buffet - that is, until I first tried the Feast Buffet at the Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa.  Why five stars?  First, I guess I got tired of the lines for the breakfast buffets on the strip.  If you wanted to eat at the Paris breakfast buffet, or any other breakfast buffet on the strip that I've tried over the years, in that magic hour when your breakfast price transitions to lunch time food, and during the busy holiday season between Christmas and New Years, well, good luck.  You would have to be in line by 9am and hope to get in by 11.  At the Feast Buffet, even if you slept in and don't get into the line until 10:45am, you will still get seated within about 30 minutes, and they continue to charge only the breakfast price.  Which brings me to...  Second, the price.  If you take the time to go to customer service and get a \"station casino\" card, the breakfast buffet is only $6.99.  I repeat, $6.99.  That includes your drinks (I usually get both coffee and the orange juice) and all the food you can eat.  Which brings me to...  Third, the food, the food, the food.  I don't know about other times of day, but at the breakfast buffet I am astounded by the choices, starting with, natch, the omelet station, and running the gamut from fruit, cereal, meats, cheeses, pasta, Asian, etc, etc, etc.  Which brings me to...  Fourth, the quality of the food.  If you observe the staff, they are constantly refreshing the food.  For example, the fruit bowls remain topped up, the desserts always look scrumptious, the sushi never looks picked over, the omelets taste really good (do they use fresher ingredients???  Cook them better???).  Now, I have not, thank goodness for my waistline, tried everything, but everything I have tried has been delicious.  Fifth (finally) is the Red Rock Casino itself.  It is quite new and when they built it they obviously considered the ventilation system (along with the rest of the beautiful decor).  So, you can sit in the wonderful ambiance of the Feast Buffet and enjoy the high ceilings and wonderful artistic details without smelling or seeing cigarette smoke.  It just doesn't seem to drift around the casino the way it does in many places.    Bottom line, I go there every chance I get for breakfast.  The meal is a deal from a pocketbook perspective, as well as a food quantity, choice, and quality perspective.  Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.",

I have eaten at the $60 buffets and the reasonably priced buffets (like Feast) and in my opinion they are all just so...yuck.  When I see people lined up for 45 minutes to go in and eat food that is processed and mass produced with a quality that rivals that of the Safeway deli.  I ask you, If you saw a restaurant near home whose sign read \"Italian-American-Chinese-Japanese-Seafood-French Restaurant, would you go?  Hell no because you know it is impossible to do all those type of foods with quality.  Why do I go?  Because I love my partner who likes to go.  The sacrifices we make for love.  I'm telling you.        But I digress.  If you are more interested in quantity than quality, just got back from the dentist and have numbed taste buds or need a place to take your 500 pound mother-in-law and not break the bank, then by all means Bon Apetit.  For me, I'd rather go to the Fat Burger in the casino.",

    "text": "One of the best local Stations Casino buffet in the valley right side by side with Green Valley Ranch Casino! This place is kept clean & classy.  Feast Buffet at Red Rock has a modern feel to it! The food and quality is pretty decent...not your creme de la creme of buffets but definitely not your cheap down town casino buffet. The food comes fresh and tasty enough to enjoy!  Your usual various stations from Mexcan, Asian, American and Italian.  They have an amazing pork chop done with mushrooms and onions and a gravy mix similar to alfredo sauce.  Tender in texture and in chew, the cream compliments the savory meat in your mouth.  you will find an assortment of fulfillment. At a reasonable price, one can find deals every now and then.    Sign up for a local stations card at red rock and receive discounts like 2 for 1 and sometimes a certain percentage off buffet prices.  A few times last August my wife was able to get a buffet for 4 people for only $12.00....practically $3.00 per person....amazing! Check out my tip on this place for a secret suggestion that is not really a secret at all!",

    "text": "Red Rock Feast buffet is pretty darn good!   I am always satisfied with the fresh selection of buffet items. They have the basics, the classics and build your own creation stations such as tacos, omelets, and pasta.   Fresh sliced meat options, turkey, roast beef, prime rib and ham.   They also have shrimp cocktail, simple sushi, salad bar, soups, breads, pizza, enchiladas, fish & chips just to name a few.   Desserts are incredible, cakes, pies, gelato, soft serve, cookies, macaroons, etc.   Drinks anything you could imagine from chocolate milk, lemonade, coffee, iced tea, and sodas.   The lay out is comfortable, spacious with both booths and table seating.   The service is always fantastic, the servers always keeping our drinks filled.   Great food, wonderful service and fantastic deals with a players card for comped or two for one deals.   I have done this buffet many times and will continue to do it every time I am in the mood to be satisfied.",

The thing is, once the breakfast buffet was over and they switched the buffet into lunch mode, everything went downhill.  The lunch items did not look appetizing at all and tasted worse than they looked. Their \"ok\" breakfast looked like a 5 star meal compared to the lunch.  I haven't come here for dinner in a long time so I feel like I shouldn't review on that.  Anyways, if you can wake up early enough for the breakfast buffet (it ends at 10:45 AM) then it is a steal. Just make sure you get out fast enough before the lunch menu comes in.",

The staff from the Cashier to the waitress were very rude. The Cashier instead of handing my husband back his debit card and player card she smacked it down on the counter. We never got refills on our drinks and in fact only saw her twice.  My blueberry muffin was HARD. I tried the Red Velvet pancakes with cream cheese. YUK!! Hard as a rock and the cheese did not taste right. No one cared to listen to us regards to it so we left. NEVER to return",

Anyway, we went for dinner and the selection was amazing.  The food quality seemed better than before.  The only negative is the weird layout...where everyone is gathered in the middle section, because that's where their best food is.  Now, since the buffet is actually quite huge and LONG, I would suggest they spread out the popular stuff.  And our streak of bad servers continued, as we never got our drinks refilled.  But in the end, I guess I'll be back.",

It is one of the best deals in Vegas.  I love that it's not on the strip and filled with tourists.  I love the extensive menu choices.  You have Sushi, Italian, Mexican, Southern and a carving station.  There is a huge soup and salad station and don't forget desserts.  You can order their signature alcoholic beverages for $3 (Skyy Vodka).  If you love southern food you will find braised oxtails, black-eyed peas, sweet potatoes, corn bread, greens.. OMG  so good  Don't miss the seafood.  This changes depending on season, but last night they had fish 4 different ways, shrimp 3 different ways, black mussel and green lip mussels and an assortment of sushi.  I'm a sushi snob, so I tend to avoid them here, but I love everything else.  They also have some of the best raspberry ice tea we have ever ordered out.",

    "text": "The price is really a great value here.  Whether I've dined alone, or brought out-of-towners with me, everyone loves the quality and selection for the price.  True, there are better buffets offered at some of the hotels on the strip -- but add that the parking at the Red Rock is plentiful and convenient, smallish wait (10 mins mostly) to get in line and seated - and a great price; it's a no brainer.  Depending on breakfast/lunch/dinner - the selections vary, of course.  I recommend coming at a tweener time (ie. 1015am; 4pm) so you get some of the breakfast and then some of the lunch, some of the lunch and then some of the dinner items. You'll also find the wait line is less.  They offer about 8 stations of food: sushi/shrimp/(crab legs@dinner); mexican items; chinese/japanese hot items; american fare; carving station; italian/pizza/pastas (omelet station@breakfast); pie/cake; ice cream parlour and self-serve; and a large center area for salads/olives/cheeses/cold cuts/soups (bagels/toast@breakfast).   The host and hostess are always super friendly, and many of the servers are just terrific.    I've eaten here at Red Rock Buffet -- 20+ times...yeah, that would likely qualify me as a fan.  I also will add that I gained 20 lbs in about 18 months with eating like that!",

    "text": "DO NOT EAT HERE unless you want to get punked by the staff.  Mark, the unprofessional lazy server, was upset that we did not want him to serve our table after making us wait 15 minutes into our meal for our drinks. We asked for a new server and got one.  No one bothered to tell Mark so we had to be the one to tell him.  That clearly pissed him off and he grouped up with a few servers to talk about it.  Yes, we SAW you and HEARD you, Mark.  Yes, that is also very unprofessional, but we didn't care that they wanted to have group therapy because none of them were our server.   Mark  must have cried to the assistant manager, Erica because she felt compelled to bother us 30 minutes into our meal to \"hit us up\" about it.  She said she heard there was an issue and if we start cussing, she'll call security and have us escorted out of there.  Excuse me???  Where is this \"cussing\" thing coming from and why are you harassing us?  We asked her if she heard us cussing and she said no, but she can review the security tapes.  Huh??? We asked why she was threatening us during our meal and where is the manager because she is not handling this situation professionally.  Upper management was not available per Erica.    Bottom line is, we didn't like the slow service so we asked for another server.  That was done and we were satisfied.  That should have been the end of it.  We thought it was, but not so much.  We were made out to be a bunch of cussing complainers according to Erica.  It was an especially nice touch to have 8 servers stand side by side against the wall on our way out to stare at us.  I felt like we were going to get jumped.  Eat here if you want to be treated like dirt.",

We waited like 20 minutes and half the tables inside were empty. None of the food was fresh. We got attitude from everyone that worked there, I'm sorry your employed at a hotel and make a decent wage and I just paid an ungodly amount for what we didn't know was the worst food on the planet.   The \"carving\" station was a chore for the two gentlemen whose only job was to slice meat. They didn't have anything else to do but slice the meat but to get that steak that you paid so much for you must find like the golden ticket for their attention. I stared the dude straight in the face for 5 minutes saying steak. At first very pleasantly but after 5 minutes not very nice. He was either staring at this 9 year old girl or this dude with a Mohawk. I really hope it was the hair.   I couldn't eat Anything here. I spat everything out. Everything was either extremely greasy, extremely sweet or just plain smelled rotten. Not to mention I had a table next to me where the dad of three kids was yelling at his kids that they did not eat enough for the money he spent. Obviously they could also realize the poor quality in good.   For the price of a meal here and even as a member of the total rewards 17.99 could get you some amazing food in this resort, why compromise that.   The biggest issue I had is the one thing I was looking forward to (dessert) was such a let down. The only thing I wanted was the creme brulee and I figured I'd be safe to eat real food and then grab one at the end and everything will be fine. The baker who could not speak English well or just played dumb was like oh we're not making anything new. I was like I paid 20 bucks and I can't even enjoy my dessert went to the front and the whole front staff is gone. Over it. Now I'm at home puking. Have a great night folks.",

    "text": "Breakfast Buffet Price: $5.00 with Player's Club Card Rating: ****-with Card ** 1/2-without  Bill, the daughter-in-law's Dad, invited me to this Breakfast Buffet the day after watching the final game of the World Series last week.  Frankly... I hate Buffets... that's with each letter capitalized, with exclamation marks HATE!!!! Why? Long lines. Over-heated or Over-cooked Food. Food that is dried out, that has been sitting for a long time. And even longer lines at desirable food areas. A LOT of waste by people whose Eyes are larger than their Stomachs.  Bill has Breakfast with three other retired Gentlemen at this Buffet. Their tactic, which he recited to me, was to arrive BEFORE 8:30am when not very many people have awaken yet. The right side of the Cashier's station is where Hotel Guests and / or Player's Club members queue up to enter Feast Buffet. At 8:30am... the length of the line was about a third of the left-side of the Station... Ha! Envy from the Left!  BUT, the wait to be assigned a table is longer than the wait to pay for your meal... a person uses finger gestures to signal to waiters at the Left and Right side of the Buffet the number of guests at the front of this next queue.  The most popular area was the Hand-Made Omelet areas... which there were two at either ends of the Buffet area. At 8:30am, the lines were five to seven deep.  I hadn't been to a \"real\" Buffet in quite awhile... it's interesting to see how a Buffet tactically fights waste by it's patrons... Some in-house prepared items such as Quiche, Bear Claws, and Filled Empanadas are only one-fifth the size of similar items found in the real world. If you like these items... be prepared for numerous trips. The Coffee, which we both wanted, came in a stainless steel thermos which could only hold less than four cups of Coffee in total. If you want more... just ask for another thermos.  Externally provided Pastries such as Donuts, Maple Bars and such were dry, very dry... as though they had been sitting for quite awhile. I don't know when the Feast Buffet opens, but I guess 8:30am is not early enough for these items.  At the end of the meal... it was interesting to do some \"people-watching\". The majority of people looked like they had a hard night of gambling... with a \"Not another Buffet!!\"-look on their face. The only people that looked like they were even remotely enthusiastic were kids running around the Buffet. Still... a lot of waste by people at neighboring tables - unfortunately. As for me... my plate was clean!  As we were leaving, after our meal, I could see why Bill recommended that we get here before 8:30am... the general Buffet line snaked close to the entrance of the Casino itself!   There sure are a LOT of \"Feast Buffets\" in Las Vegas here at Red Rock & Green Valley Ranch AND at the Station Casinos. Have some Casinos out-sourced their Buffet service to a separate entity that only specializes in Buffets? Seems like it...  Bill thought the Breakfast was also Average, at best. But, at Five Bucks (with Player's Club Card), you can't find a better bargain anywhere else. If I had to pay full price... I'd Seriously think of looking somewhere else...",

The Turkey and dressing makes me Soooo home sick! From the Great prices to the sweet girls at the front who check you in, to the host who seats you, to the server who serves you...everyone has a smile and treats you fabulous. What I think is super cool... is that every kitchen has their own chef! I highly recommend the Feast Buffet to anyone visiting or living here in Las Vegas. Not to mention when you're done eating, there's a movie theater and bowling alley in the Red Rock Casino!! Yoo-Hooooo!!!",

Both are great choices.)  For the price there is no better buffet in Vegas in my opinion than this and the Green Valley Ranch buffet. Get a players club card and get your buffet for slightly cheaper too. The selection is great and the food is good quality for the low price of this buffet. This is definitely a must stop for me whenever I come to Vegas.",

Anyone who has been to one can tell you that you've got your buffets that are well-tended, and your buffets that look like a horde of ravenous beasts have just passed through.  The Feast Buffet is well-staffed and well-stocked, and has enough selection to keep anyone stuffed.  If you're coming here for Sunday Brunch, expect a line.  I have, on one occasion, counted eighty people in line...and that was just in the non-guest line.  There's a separate line for guests, individuals with small children, and handicapped persons.  That line was somewhat shorter, but still involved a wait.    Why were these people waiting in such a line?  Frankly, because the place is worth it!  Prime Rib was on offer, along with dishes from all the major cuisines.  A sushi chef prepared fresh sushi and sashimi at one end, a chef prepared lasagna at the counter next door, the smell of barbecue wafted from the counter beyond that while a woman restocked the quesadillas at the counter down the way.  And that was only on one side!  The other contained breakfast foods, desserts, Asian foods, and an ice cream counter.  The large salad bar was in the center and had it all.  Breakfast here is an inexpensive $5, while lunch will run you $7.  On Sundays the prices are higher on account of different (read: more expensive) food offerings.  I would consider the prices here quite reasonable for what you get.  If you're in the area and looking for buffet, try this one first.",

    "text": "Really, I'm very much over the Las Vegas buffet. After almost five years in this town you start to realize that 95% of the food at 95% of the buffets is pretty much interchangeable. And most of it isn't all that good, especially when you're paying full price. So I'm going to be a tough grader when it comes to buffets.  Fortunately, the Station Feasts are discounting all month so Sunday brunch was $11.95, an acceptable price to pay.  The food was OK - better than average for a buffet, fairly fresh but generally unremarkable for better or for worse. Decent variety, with nice touches including roasted jalapeno peppers on the Mexican station, a really good pesto pasta salad, smoked salmon and bagels, and kielbasa. The hand-sliced prime rib was decent, although I had to ask twice to get the size and cut that I wanted. Station also does desserts really well. You can't go wrong with any of them.  Two things of note about this visit.  1) Station loses a star for the decision to limit guests to two glasses of cheap swilly \"champagne\" at brunch. What the hell? When I first moved to town, getting half in the bag on barely drinkable sparkling wine was half the fun of getting up on a Sunday morning. I'm sure the bean counters were on their butts about the amount of free champagne they were pouring, but come on! The stuff is dirt cheap and since when are casinos stingy about getting their guests drunk?  2) The friendliness and customer focus of my server gets that star back. She always had a smile, was quick to bring me fresh silverware (without asking) or top off my drinks. She even brought me a third glass of champagne in spite of Station's dumb new brunch policy. I've always thought that even though buffet servers are probably among the most underappreciated of industry workers, the ones you find at Station's Feast buffets across the city tend to be very pleasant and friendly, so much so that you wonder why they're not working for a real restaurant. This was no exception.  Slightly above average food, well above average service, tainted by obvious parsimony that probably manifests itself behind the scenes in ways that give me pause about ingredient quality, etc.",

There was also a considerable wait, about 20 minutes, which was a bit odd I think since we went on a Wednesday night. Many choices from Asian foods like sushi, potstickers, orange chicken; some Italian like pastas, stromboli, pizzas, they even have a pasta station to customize your plate; and a grill for some board meats like top round cuts, pork loin, turkey, and grilled chicken. There's also a desert station with some red velvet cake, carrot cake, cookies, and a gelato bar. All and all, there's a lot of choices and while most are hit and miss as far as flavor, some are great and worth a second serving of.",

The worst fare was their soggy sopping wet eggs benedict that was so underseasoned and cold that I left it untouched, second only to their dry flavorless imitation crab sushi, which you'd expect in any American buffet, which they also underwhelmed us with their unsavory underseasoned meats.  Bland and uninspiring was their grand theme, and the machinations only flowed smoothly due to our excellent table service.. but after all, this is Las Vegas, this meal like the city was flashy, yet it fell short of grandeur.",

The first time I came here was about 2 years ago and absolutely hated anything, we left the buffet hungry from how bad the food was. Really disappointed because they had all kinds of food. We can back for prime rib night a few months back and it was absolutely amazing! The prime rib was nice and juicy, food had lots of flavor and almost everything tasted really good. Huge variety of desserts and tasted excellent! Not sure what happened the first time I was here but the last time I was here it was definitely good",

Located in the Red Rock Casino and Resort, every time I have seen this place it has had a good amount of people inside so time to see what all the fuss was about.   I was seated promptly and off to the buffet I went! There was a nice selection of both international and western foods.  Is it a Bellagio type buffet?  No, but then again, the price reflects that.  You can join the player's club for free and pay around $20.  Each area of the buffet had around 10-20 options and there were I believe 5 or so stations? Everything is made from scratch so the variety was nice and allowed for an enjoyable meal.  I went on a Saturday so was able to have some of the prime rib that was included as part of the buffet.  The pieces that the server provided were well portioned so that was awesome.  The service was very good.   I would return the next time I'm hungry.  For a very detailed and in-depth review, Feast was featured on the buzzed worth it series - youtube!",

They should really reconsider their poor customer service because of this silly RULE! If you treat people nicely, you might get more rewards. Instead they treat you badly and don't want to get any tip at all. Does that make sense?",

There was only peel & eat shrimp (which was rubbery), brown tilapia pan fried, and fried shrimp. This does NOT MAKE IT A SEAFOOD BUFFET! Not only was there a lack of seafood choices, the salads were wilted and brown, the Asian choices tasted bland, so the only things that looked safe to eat was the prime rib and fried chicken. Meh. Just ok. We tried to redeem the meal with dessert. The key lime pies tasted like toxic chemicals. The carrot cake tasted artificial. The only decent thing was the pistachio gelato. If Red Rock wants to continue to compete with better quality buffets in town, they must step their game up and serve better food. This was the worst buffet I've been to in Vegas and I would not recommend it to anyone.",

Champagne Brunch (on the weekends) is the way to go. If you haven't already, sign up for the boarding pass (near Starbucks at the food court) for discounts, it's free.

The chef carving the ham should teach a class on serving without a smile because he seemed to be an expert on the topic. Ham, eggs, bacon, the usual standards were OK. Hash browns were burned. Nothing could save the bitter coffee. Gelato appears to be off limits during breakfast hours. Maybe a sign would help. Donuts had the taste and texture of something purchased at a week old bakery outlet. Server looked at my plate and actually asked \"Is everything tasty?\" If it was tasty, do you think my plate would still have all that food on it?  Two stars for cold orange juice, cleanliness and free garage parking.",

    "text": "DOWN HILL! 100 miles an hour.  With no brakes.    HEALTH DEPARTMENT NO NO! Many of the cooks on the line have beards I'm not talking about a a little facial hair,  I'm talking about beards ... beards that you could put a comb through.  SEE PICTURE.  I brought it up to the attentions of someone who is supposedly in charge who also had a beard that they were not wearing any type of net around their facial hair they are very irritated when asked if that was against health code he said yes and for the hour that remained we observed them NOT fixing the issue. I can only imagine having their facial hair falling into the meat that they're slicing ... the potatoes that they're cooking or the pans of food that they're refilling.  Quite frankly the longer we watched the more disgusted we were... so then we decided to see if we ever saw anybody wash their hands and on the whole line or change gloves since we had a front-row seat ... the answer is no - in an entire hour did NOT see it from all of the people up and down the line ... now maybe we missed one, but with that many cooks and not seeing it happen not one time.  Then there was a COOK who is in The Carving Station who on his right forearm had such a large gash or burn and was exposed... approximately 4 inches long and an inch wide that look like it was oozing from infection not covered obviously ... plain to the view... as he sliced your food it was disgusting.  Local that has eaten here since it opened.  While still better than most if not all off-strip casino buffets let's evaluate what it was ... to what it has become.    $60 for Friday seafood buffet.  Last 4 visits in 4 months terrible.  No line or small one if you come before 7pm.  Crab legs small and LOADED WITH SALT.  So bad I got ill after one experience from too much salt intake.  All 4 times prime rib bloody raw, not medium rare or rare, just to plain raw. Not because of a line of a lot of people  and had to pull it out early.... several times it was early in the dinner and the restaurant was two-thirds empty and anybody ordering prime rib had to have it put on a grill just to make it edible. This is not what we pay this kind of money for to have prime rib thrown on the Grill just so you can eat it without gagging.  Note I order everything medium rare and have my whole life so for me to think that this is bad it is. This is not quality driven.  The famous chicken noodle soup which I have always thought to be one of the best, if not the best at any restaurant I've eaten in 20 years in Las Vegas ... I eat out at least 4 times a week... it has changed. Clearly the recipe has changed or there's a new person in charge of making the chicken soup.  I don't know if they've changed their chicken base or if they've changed the recipe altogether but now it is watered down and has absolutely no memorable flavor or taste at all ... a beautiful looking soup that tastes bland and like water.  Desserts are crap. resorting to a chocolate chip cookie because of all of the desserts looking so dried out with a very small selection to begin with... was probably worse than grabbing the dried up offerings they had... the cookie broke apart like shattered glass.   I've always thought their desserts needed some sprucing up but with close examination they were all old and dried up and the sad end to a disappointing meal all together.  Do you know that they don't even have one cake as a dessert other than their terrible-looking carrot cake.   Sincerely,   A local neighbor, regular customer,  who is grossed out and has given you the benefit of the doubt 4 times in a row and this last one was a real doozy.",

On this particular Friday night, we waited about 30 mins to pay and be seated, but the line was managed efficiently.   Entering the buffet we were impressed by the variety of food options which catered to several different cuisines. There were no lines at food stations and all items were stocked and plentiful. The barbecue and American stations really stood out. The dessert station primarily featured gelato and several varieties of cream pies, sliced on demand. As another yelper previously mentioned, the woman behind the gelato counter was sassy but we found her unintentionally delightful.   The cost ($22) was well worth the experience, however the prime rib, which distinguishes this buffet from others, ended up being pretty forgettable.",

Me and my boyfriend went there around 1pm and we didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes.The food is delicious and you have so many choices !! I would recommend not to eat for the day if you plan on going there so you can actually enjoy a lot of food. Only negative point is my boyfriend got a coke and while he was drinking we realized the glass was awfully dirty..eww... It was really disappointing to see that especially because we were enjoying the food so much.  But there is such a large choice of food and very tasty that I will go back again and definitely recommend this place.",

Never had breakfast or lunch there, only dinner. Never had a bad experience.  SERVICE: I LOVE their iced tea, (not sure if it's fresh brewed or not), and I will literally drink at least 7 glasses of it throughout my meal.  Servers almost always replace my tea without me asking, and before it's completely finished. Friendly and prompt service. Dirty plates always removed promptly.   FOOD: A great selection (in my opinion), and a lot to choose from for vegetarians.  This is important to me since I am one. Constantly putting fresh food out. (I've been to buffets where you can tell the food has been sitting out for a long time.) Not a huge selection of desserts, but I'm not a fan of sweets anyway, so doesn't bother me. They do offer gelato, however, (in addition to the chocolate/vanilla soft serve machine), that's really good!  ATMOSPHERE: Always very clean.  It's really close to slot machines, so it is fairly noisy. But hey, it's a casino, it's to be expected.    Highly recommend!!",

Also, I have gone twice when it's prime rib & shrimp night (saturday) and the shrimp is not deveined, and sometimes they taste like, overboiled or overcooked/mushy.  It's not terrible, but not like fresh tasting.    What's nice is that there is a decent discount if you have a Station Casino players card, it's like $13.99 on regular nights with the card vs $18.99. Saturday nights are like $17.99.... something like that.... It is also better than the Feast buffet at the Aliante hotel (didn't like that one at all unfortunately... didn't seem as good quality as Red Rock)  Recently we discovered the Silverton buffet and I have enjoyed that it's not as salty, and their saturday Polynesian night is pretty good.  Their regular weeknight buffet is good too, although the selection is not quite as large as Red Rock.",

Its a Tuesday lunch which most of the tables were empty,  but it took them 30 minuets to find a table for us?! Then the older Filipino lady that took us to the table started to yell at us. Simply because our receipt says 6 and we have 7 in our party which includes my 2 years old son. I told her wait a minute, the cashier at your buffet wrote that down and the lady standing at the front already told you we had 7 in our party. Why are you giving us attitude?! She just gave a whatever facial expression and walked away. We didn't want her ruin our trip so we just gone with our business. Then comes the kicker, my wife swiped the players card and it said you have won a Starbucks coffee but the printer is not working. Please go to the reward club to obtain the print out. But when we got there and told the lady about it. Her response was I don't know anything about free Starbucks coffee, go to another machine and try again. I honestly think this is a very good casino with mostly good staffs. But some of them need to be retrain, so issues like these won't turn your customers away.",

Some of the offerings remain great choices: this buffet has excellent Mashed Potatoes and Gravy, Fried Shrimp, and desserts. The carving station (there are now two) generally have a good variety of meats, and the employees will put your selection on the grill if it isn't already cooked to your specification.   However, lots of items lack flavor. The Breadsticks have little seasoning, the Salt and Pepper Wings often taste old, and the Pizza isn't memorable. Other choices simply sit out too long and don't look appetizing, even for a brave buffet adventurer.  This is still a good value for the price of the buffet, and if you have plenty of time you can sample a lot and find the food that hits the spot for you. I'm always looking forward to the Fried Shrimp, and occasionally the dessert area offers individual Toffee Cakes which are amazing.",

The lack of variety and lack of knowledge on how to fry chicken golden brown with seasoning is shameful. And when asked if there was chicken that wasn't over cooked, the guy cutting the pork roast was like it's all from the same batch; like that was suppose to make it all better. When u can't get decent fried chicken at a buffet it's time to change the staff!",

While I'm not keen on buffets, I do have to say that as far as buffets go, the Feast is pretty decent.   During breakfast/brunch, the pecan rolls can't be be beat.  During lunch and dinner, the gelato is a must.  Beyond those items, the Feast always has a wide variety of food and there is certainly something for everyone. Also, if you show your player's card you get a couple bucks off. If you like buffets, you'll love the Feast. If you're like me and usually hate buffets, you may actually like the Feast.",

Next is a Hispanic section with huevos rancheros and the best chilaquiles I've ever had.  I live 1,700 miles away, and I can't wait to visit again, just for the chilaquiles!  On top of all that, there is a huge square station filled with just about any fresh fruit and fruit salad you can imagine, grits, oatmeal, yogurt, and muesli with several toppings.

Thursday evening, we met friends for the dinner buffet.  The prime rib was outstanding - red, the way I love it.  They were also grilling slices for people who want their meat dead.  The shrimp were good, but I did skip having any sushi.  Instead, I loaded up on some kimchee and then on to the gelato area for my dessert fix.  Today, we went for breakfast.  It's always a nice way to start the day.  A bit of chopped chicken liver, some smoked salmon, and a small sampling of oatmeal with raisins, brown sugar, and cinnamon.    I'll be back often.  I like the food and the ambiance.  My only complaint is, \"Where the hell are the spoons?\"  You'd think they'd at least have spoons automatically in the morning table settings when so many people are having coffee.  This is not just a Red Rock gripe, either.  I see this more often around town.  Why?",

This causes long lines and is ridiculous. I don't order omelets so I don't wait in that line but yet there are 15 people in line JUST to get meat for their breakfast (sausage, bacon, hasbrowns etc) They definitely need to spread this out so that there isn't a cluster of people.

So they get 3 stars total because staff is nice but make sure you leave them a tip I see people stiffing them a lot ! Even though it's a buffet they make money on tips doesn't have to be like a waiter at a restaurant where u give 20% but we always try to leave a couple dollars a person because they do bring your drinks and clean after you so don't be rude. We saw a group of 6 leave a messy table with no tip for the lady to clean after they left I could see her silently frustrated/sad please leave something for them especially if you're a larger group!",

    "text": "This is probably the best of the Feast Buffets. We came on a Friday night, half expecting a nightmare line. There wasn't one!   It's prettier, decor-wise, than the other locations, but the layout of the tables is sorta weird. They really try to cram as many tables in as possible. Where there might be a nice big aisle between tables, they've decided to put little two-person tables. This makes the space between the tables very small and, if you're seated at that tiny table like we were, there are constantly people walking by, perilously close to dragging the bottom of their jacket through your food. If I return, I'll definitely be one of those pains in the ass that screws up the whole seating line by requesting a booth (normally, I hate those people, but this place definitely necessitates it).  Anyway, the main reason we came here was that I wanted a buffet that had sushi (and didn't want to spend $$$), so that's where I headed immediately. There were your basic 3 varieties of rolls; they were tasty! They definitely don't let the sushi sit out for ages. Aside from that, there are your basic areas: American, Italian, Mexican, Asian, salad and dessert.   Pretty basic buffet, slightly better quality than the other Feast buffets. I'd go again, if I happen to be in the area!",

When my wife and I don't have cravings that jive, the Feast Buffet is a safe answer.  I find myself first frequenting the Asian section, where they have the Korean BBQ Ribs, Pork Hash and Shrimp Dumplings.  Their white rice is OK.  It isn't as sticky as I like it, but it isn't bone dry either.  Their Sushi section isn't too bad either and is located at the opposite end of the deserts.  Their rolls are very small, probably a tiny bit larger than a quarter.  Their first is fresh and on par with other buffets offering sushi.  The American BBQ section was great.  They have yams there usually, polish sausage and prime rib or beef brisket.   The pizzas they have are OK, the Stromboli was very good on my first visit. However it was kinda dry and crispy the last time I went. :(   For deserts their cookies are better than I remember it.  Nice and soft, not hard as I remembered in the past.  Over all it's a safe choice if you're looking for a deal and realize that you get what you pay for.  Service was great both times from our waitresses.  The place is clean and has a relaxing atmosphere.",

For just $5 more, you could go to the famous World Carnival Buffet at the Rio Casino which offers WAY, WAY, WAY more.  The food here was just \"meh.\" Nothing special and nothing out of the ordinary. For the price, I thought they would offer more but they don't. I guess the interior decor makes up for it. The Red Rock is a really nice casino - but their buffet just didn't really do it.  We only came here because we didn't want to drive - and we wanted to try something new. Next time, we'll stick to something we know.",

    "text": "Some of the food is dry, like the salmon I had this weekend at the lunch buffet.   The biggest problem we have with the buffet is they need a new manager to run it & properly staff & run it.  We waited in line about an hour for breakfast & there were empty tables all over, & most were not cleared by bus boys. They didn't have enough staff, & with only 2 cashiers working up front, they were set up at all levels to only serve about half the people who wanted to dine & this was a slow weekday.  You would think that when there are people who want to give you money, you could staff up & properly run the buffet.  When we finally got seated the woman who took us to her table stuck a piece of gum in her mouth as she walked us to our table & she had an attitude of \"I don't care\" as she told us our server would be there soon.  Our Mexican server (female) was very good though & helpful except they don't give you spoons unless you ask for them & everyone needs one for the ice cream, etc.   The ice cream is great, my favorite desert.    Waiting so long in line when we got there about 10:45 am is just crazy & not the way to run a business.   Since I like the food and it is cheap I am giving it another shot tomorrow morning, but earlier.  It opens at 8 am.    P.S. I like that when you order coffee they  bring a pot to the table for you.",

They have a decent salad section, italian, chinese, mexican, american, sorta-soul food, american classic, lots of treats too.  Coming here also remind me that America is full of disfigured, fat, rude, mulleted red necks with \"I'm with Stupid\" tshirts. If you learn to ignore that, and this is a must for enjoying vegas...this is the spot to get a nice meal.  I do have one complaint. I've been eating here for almost two years now. And I've seen the food change and come and go. This past weekend, I was witness to horror of all horrors. I had finished my meal of ribs, teka maki, tamales and jello...i went to go get my celebratory coffee gelato. And low and behold, the gelato was gone. all the wonder flavors were gone, replaced with...ICE CREAM...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO....not only that but they had removed the beautiful display gelatos and replaced them with crushed peanuts and sprinkles as display.  Dime store sprinkles ARE NOT EQUAL SUBSTITUTIONS FOR GELATO.  Anyway, I digress. Great buffet if you can overlook the sacrilege of taking away my gelato.  Good prices, pretty decor, great food.

Though I don't think it is the best in quality. I mean, there are only a few items that I enjoy eating like mussels, shrimp, prime rib, gelato, soft serve. Sushi wasn't very good.   So if you like variety and value, this is the place to be. If you want quality food...hmm...I can't even tell you where anymore. I think that most of the buffets quality have been deteriorating.   Back about 12  (1996) years ago when I first visited Las Vegas, the Mirage buffet was awesome. Then after a couple years it got really icky. Then around 10 years ago (1998).  Bellagio became the star with lots of yummy. They used to have totally great quality and exotic food (lychee, rambutan, fresh sashimi)  Now they have none of that. Sigh...I can't even find a fancy buffet these days. I went inside Wynn to check the buffet out but it looked so-so. Not too many food that I \"must\" have.  If anyone knows of fancy buffet even with a price tag, let me know!",

You will find everything from sushi, braised oxtail, and margherita pizzas to hand-sliced deli meats and cheeses, specialty salads, and scooped gelato, mini red velvet cupcakes, and chocolate eclairs for dessert.  I like that everything is laid out neatly according to cuisine - Asian, Southern/American, Italian, Mexican, etc. and the fact that the salad bar has got more going on than just iceberg lettuce and a few rotten cherry tomatoes. The salad bar was freshly stocked and the rest of the buffet didn't appear to be sitting under a heat lamp all day long, either. And for only $10.99 at the lunch buffet and less than $20 for dinner, it's one of the best deals in Vegas.",

I stuck to American and had a HUGE PLATE of mashed potatoes and cream corn!  Both were delicious!  With it I had a second plate covered in Prime Rib (nearly as big as my plate) along with some cornbread!  After devouring those two plates of food,  I opted for some desert.  Bad choice,  because they had my favorite,  German Chocolate Cake!  I killed about 3 pieces of that stuff,  and a piece of Tiramisu!  At this point I had already refilled my Coke a Cola about 7 times,  so one might assume that I was full!    Hell yes I was full,  and my tummy did not like it one bit!  I thought I was going to burst.  Bad stomach ache for about a half hour after I ate,  but it soon went away once I took $10 to the Craps table and combined with my Girl made $260!  Not a bad way to cure a stomach ache.  If I did not eat like a hostage and give myself a tummy ache I would of given 5 stars!  Overall,  food was great,  prices were good,  service was good,  and the environment and surroundings were pleasant.  I will definitely be returning to Red Rock Casino on my next visit to Vegas,  and the choice has already been made regarding which buffet to eat at...Feast Buffet at Red Rock.

Regular(non players card) dinner price is $18.99 when I visited a few weeks ago, if I remember. I believe the cost of this Feast buffet is slightly higher than their other Feasts at the other Station casinos in the chain.",

In Europe (we are from Holland and Norway respectively) we have little concept of \"all you can eat.\" I find American buffets wonderfully indifferent to the common good, much like American motor vehicle (I own mustang with wasteful but FUN V8 engine)  We have some \"buffet,\" however, it is almost always \"all you can stack on a plate\" and then you have to pay for the next plate.  This buffet is easily one of the best deals for the price in vegas. My husband ate nothing but meat until he fell asleep at the table, and I was able to indulge my sweet tooth. The sushi is a little dry, but the prime rib is excellent and worth the price of admission alone.",

Our last visit, this past weekend, was a totally different experience. We tasted several different dishes, as usual. We found the Mexican food greasy; the Chinese food greasy, the kielbasa  had to be discarded, and the fried chicken didn't taste like chicken. We called over the maitre d' to ask what the problem was. He checked with the head chef and came back telling us that they were using new recipes. We asked him to tell the chef to go back to the old recipies. Don't fix what's not broken. Since we were unable to finish any of the dishes we chose, we have decided to find another buffet to take our business to. It's a good thing we used our playing card for a discount and had a coupon. It wasn't even worth that.",

Went for breakfast today (get the free players card, it made breakfast $4.99) and really for the price, you can't beat it.  I pretty much go for the eggs benedict. The way to my heart has always been large variety in small portions, so hence the reason I love this place. I think I had 10 things on one plate. Eggs benny, hash browns, a sausage, bacon, biscuit with gravy, corned beef hash, blintz with strawberry sauce, mini blueberry pancake, mini potato cake, small scrambled egg pile and 2 mexican breakfast dishes I forget what they were named.  ok so 12. What really blew me away this time was : 1. our server was the best damn buffet server I've ever experienced-big bald white guy, awesome!!! I wish I had more tip money to give him! Very attentive and didn't forget anything. 2. The water is now served in big glass decanters with lids, like at Wicked Spoon. kudos! 3. The coffee was delicious, and it was real cream in a little pot They've really upped their game since last time I went there.  If you're gonna complain about a $5 breakfast, you're obviously an assh*le, and maybe the really low price makes me bias, but I just love this breakfast. Where else in Vegas can you get everything you want on one plate for such a low price? As far as buffet breakfasts go, this place is my fav hands down!  You can get $5 breakfast any day except Sunday, when they are doing Sunday brunch ($13.99 and you get mimosas!!)  See ya next time red rock!",

First off, the food was virtually flavorless, that normally isn't a problem when at buffets, sometimes.... It happens. There were three of us that had eaten, and every single one of us lost our food about 10 minutes from calling it quits trying to make this cardboard taste good.  Our waitress was a sweetheart and really was the only reason that I felt I could actually push the one star rating.  Overall this was the worst experience I have ever had at a buffet.",

    "text": "Had lunch here on the last day of a three day trip.  Wasn't going to do the buffet, but was stuck at Red Rock and decided to take a look.  Wow, only $10.99 for lunch!  I asked the hostess if I could take a look first and was surprised at the size and selection.  I definitely had to give it try after that.  For that price, it certainly beat anything I saw in their food court.  No comparison.  It obviously didn't hold a candle to my all-time favorite buffets on the strip at the Wynn and Bellagio, but for the price, it wasn't bad at all.  It wasn't celestial like the two that I just mentioned, but overall, I thought it was pretty good.  The waitperson I had was great and I noticed a nice little menu book of drinks with $2 on the cover.  She confirmed that all alcoholic drinks from that book were only $2.00 each!  I looked through the whole book (quite a selection) and saw that they not only had beer and wine, but also real cocktails for the same price.  The wines listed were Barefoot Cellars so I passed on that (but thought the price to be highly reasonable) and ended up having a Skyy vodka Cosmopolitan and also a Stoli Blue Lemonade.  The portions were generous and there was definitely alcohol in there.  Amazing for the price!  During the feeding frenzy, I recall the following on my plate...sushi, spaghetti and meatballs, fried chicken, turkey, roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing, pizza, carnitas, spring rolls, chicken soup, and lord knows what else that I just can't remember.  And yes, I only took a little of each, but even then...yikes.  Far from the strip, so certainly not worth a special trip, but if I'm in the area, I'd definitely do the lunch buffet here again.",

Got in line for breakfast at ten and finally got in at eleven. Just before that an older gentleman passed out just in front of us. The cashiers were totally oblivious until myself and another guest rushed to help and yelled at them to call security.

    "text": "Who doesn't love the gluttonous affair of partaking in a buffet! The choices! The idea of bottomless trough of chow! The price paid of admission to a smorgasbord of delectable delights! With that being said, I love me some buffet. The query at hand though is the \"FEAST BUFFET\" at Red Rock Hotel & Casino. Now being a Vegas Local, I've had my experience of buffets.  From  Excalibur buffet, Planet Hollywood Spice Market buffet, RIO world buffet,  Wicked Spoon Buffet at Cosmo, Studio B at M resort, Buffet at Wynn, so on....Where does Feast buffet stack up against the competition? To make is simple I fall back on the overly used yet overly appropriate quote \"you get what you pay for\".  Though it does not compare to the upper echelon of buffets (i.e. M resort, Bellagio, Wynn) it fares more closely to mid-tier choices such as Rio world buffet and MGM buffet.  That being said the thing that sets it apart from those buffets is the price! 13.99 for dinner? Yes please. The choices are moderate for a Vegas buffet, offering you 2 different cut to order steaks and usually a honey baked ham as a main entree, worldly offerings such as sushi, Mexican, Italian, and Chinese medley of fare.  The taste was nothing extreme with some choices being bland and desperately asking for some hotsauce, gravy, or a little salt and pepper.  There are lots of other pre-cut entrees though, such as a multitude of chickens (the most versatile of meats!) and beef and pork products. The salad bar is decent with your typical choices of fresh veggies but one thing I like for the gluttonous AND slothful is that they have premade Caesar salad.  They also have about 3 typical soups (chili, chicken noodle, minestrone) in the salad bar and a few ethnic choices in their respective cultural sector of the buffet. The desserts were standard fare, with ice cream, cookies, cakes but best of all pie! There are a bunch of pies in the display case and you simply ask them to slice you a piece! I tried the lemon meringue, the banana cream, and the cheesecake (GLUTTON! GAH!).. They were all decent with the cheesecake being my favorite. Ok, it's hard to review a buffet as there are too many choices so I will tell you overall, FOR THE PRICE, it's not bad! If it were more than $20 I'd pass, but as long as they run their special (you need a players card which is free so get one first) then I might go if I'm lazy to cook and can't decide what to eat and too lazy to drive to Rio (better choice same price IF you are a local - Mon-Fri half off for locals at rio World buffet). Ok fellow connoisseurs of the culinary empire of AYCE..buffet away!  (geez how many times did I said buffet? 10 e-props if you can't count them!)",

Stayed away for quite a while because quality and variety of food has gone down hill. On this particular day (4-10-16), the only thing that was edible was the omelet.  The most disturbing was the lack of care of the cooking staff, especially at the carving station. Next to the roast beef, there were pile of dried up pieces of meat and the roast beef was not trimmed until people ordered. Rather disgusting. The meat was so tough even the carver joked that he needed to sharpen his knife.  A lot of other food items were so old, they should be trucked to the pig farm.",

I tried many things including: roast beef, turkey, hush puppies, pepperoni pizza, corn bread, corn, mashed potatoes, baked potato, soba noodles, mac n cheese, nachos, beef, pineapple, and cookies n cream ice cream. My boyfriend also tried a bunch of different stuff. We both agreed, the food was extremely bland.  My pepperoni pizza was rock hard. I thought it would be fresh since they reopen for dinner at 4... The mac n cheese didn't taste like cheese at all. To cut it short, the only thing I did enjoy was the mashed potatoes, baked potato, and corn bread.   I would not return.

So my friend goes and gets some prime rib. He asks the cook to cook the slice some more two times. Upon his third request the cook continued to ignore him and then places the meat on the plate and says that once the meat touches the plate he can't take it back. Oh, now you heard the customer's request?  So when my friend tells me this as he arrives at our table, I tell him to leave the plate and get another. As our waiter comes by he asks if he should take the plate. We say yes and why. The waiter gives us a real nasty look like we are crazy. I go to the salad bar and there's an Asian salad. I'm allergic to shell fish so there's a staff member behind the counter and I had to yell to get her attention. I ask if there's any shell fish or shell fish ingredients in the Asian salad. The staff member gives me a flip attitude and tells me \"It's Asian Salad\". Um really? I ask again, she turns away then turns back and says its vegetarian. So I'm about to take some and she stops me and says not to take any as they use a fish sauce in the dressing. Oh? So then it's NOT vegetarian! The food stations at the international section were empty and lacked any appeal. The food was sub par. I'm really really disappointed and came home hungry. I will never go back and will never recommend this Buffett! Staff was flip and rude and the food was gross.",

    "text": "The first time I went here was way back when this place first opened...I remember eating the food here, and saying it was the best buffet food I've ever had...  We came here for Christmas lunch for the first time since I was last here... and that whole perspective of \"this place has the best buffet food\" has changed...what happened? Out of all the \"little bit of everythings\" that I had on my plate, there were probably one or two things that I actually enjoyed eating...1) the prime rib which was super juicy and flavorful, 2) the crispy pork belly with cabbage...everything else just blah/nothing memorable about it...  On a much lighter side note, this buffet is probably one of the better buffets that serve delicious desserts...not the best, but certainly very, very good for a buffet...heck, my whole meal should have just been nothing but desserts...they were better than the actual cold/hot foods haha...the red velvet mini cupcakes were very good, as well as the brownie a la mode, cannoli, and choco chip cookies...I would have liked to sample more of the desserts but I was already heading towards a food coma hahaha...  The ambience is nice, very spacious, and a large selection of food...the wait to get in is ridiculous...we waited about an 1.5 hours in line...not sure how much we paid, but typical buffet prices have gone up as much as $35+ now...then again it's Vegas...expect it to be like that even when it's not a holiday...",

Yes, it is cheap and close by, but the food quality is pretty low. Sushi is inedible (if you've ever had ok sushi), a lot of breakfast dishes were very cold, asian station is way too greasy. I mean, it's ok for what you pay for, but I think the buffet at Palms for the same price is a lot better.   The only thing I enjoyed was their bakery/desert station. I like they have a big variety of low sugar/ sugar free items. The banana cream pie was tasty.",

Which, for me, is no easy feat, because they have the best unsweetened iced tea ever, and in one meal i can have upwards of 5 or 6 of them. Never have to wait for refills.. very good selection (even for vegetarians), and  probably my favorite \"affordable\" buffet. My favorite of all time is Bacchanal at Caesar's, however Feast buffet is a fraction of the price, comparatively. Never have left less than euphoric and ridiculously full!! Recommend to everyone!",

I was thinking it would just like the strip buffets but then realized it was in a local casino so I lowered my expectations. I hate here during lunch and is just like any other buffet you would find in any other off strip hotel except for the Buffet at M Resort which is way better in my opinion.   The food here is nothing exciting with your Asian, Mexican, American, Seafood, Italian and Dessert stations you'd find in most off strip buffets. What I liked was the price and you can save the rest for the casino or whatever. Service was great and our waitress was quick refill our drinks, buffet areas were clean and I liked the contemporary design.",

Tasted the barbecue beef, liked it.  I'm not sure about the Mexican food, we are used to Tex-Mex so it didn't look appealing to anyone in our group.  Didn't care for the shrimp, it was mushy and fishy.  Living on the Gulf of Mexico has us spoiled there, too.  The service was ok, nothing stellar, but who wants tea when you've got all this tasty food?  Gelato is a plus.  The people working behind the counters serving and preparing food seemed to be a million miles away, service was good but the smiles and small talk wasn't there, it must be a thankless job dealing with so many different faces of mindless tourists.  They were working really hard, and it is appreciated!  We do plan to go back for the breakfast buffet on our next trip to Vegas (tickets in hand already).  Advice, be sure they are open before you go, this is not a 24 hour operation, and also if you sign up for players club, you get $5 off.",

The price is great for what you get, and being at the Red Rock instead of a normal station casino makes this buffet better than those ones because Red Rock is a little more upscale in general (though the price of the buffet is the same). Anyone who has been to the other Feast Buffets can tell you this one is a muuuch better place! Love it. Although I do have to say that no matter who it is that is scooping up your ice cream, they always seem like they hate their job, always pretty unfriendly lol.",

Well I'll be damn if the prime rib was excellent, plus the sauces and sides to make it complete including sweet potatoes. The meat was very well seasoned and I had to go back for more, see you do eat to much as I had to try some other items as well. And of course you can't leave without a trip to the Gelato station. Okay I'm stuffed just thinking about it. The ambiance is nice as it is anywhere in Red Rock and after I burn off the 10 thousand calories I ate I'll be back.",

Red Rock buffet is definitely one of the better dinner buffets I have been to in Las Vegas.  98% of the items I tried were hot...not just warm or luke warm which is a major pet peeve of mine when going to a buffet.   Be prepared because the line to get in on a Tuesday was pretty long.  The carving station had turkey, lamb I believe, prime rib and maybe something else.  All of the side dishes and vegetables were pretty good.  The au gratin potatoes though.............OH MY!!!  So delish! And last but not least, the deserts.  WOW WOW WOW.  I felt like such a piglet.  And the frozen custard was to die for.  And the lil red velvet cupcakes....nom nom nom! Would definitely recommend RR Feast Buffet!",

I didn't notice when we came back from our first round the TWO sets of drinks. I had thought she got the orders wrong. Nope. She brought two at a time. Amazing. Not intrusive, and cleared plates before we even left to back. If we didn't switch so much in the seating process I would know her name.  They kept seating us in places others where already sat.   Thank god I had cash because if you elect to pay by card, you need to tip at the counter. I just hope you had as good of a server as me.  The food: this is where the stars come into play.  Soups: every single one that was self serve (minus the tom yum) was caked. Like no one had checked it in hours. Not even stirred it. So didn't touch them. Tom Yum: very basic. They put three shrimp in it, but nothing that gives it the actual flavor.  Sushi: fish was good. Can't complain! The rice though seemed from last week. Wasabi was on point! Spicy and fresh.  Prime Rib: was good. The lady behind me wanted more rare. They had like five servings left of the one. They wouldn't even cut into the other one for the guest. Even as it was sitting there.   Veg: was ok. Broccoli was way UNDER cooked. Green beans are hit and miss.   Cheese bread was good, as was ceviche surprisingly.   Just a little more attention at this buffet and it would live up to the best of Vegas. Till then still going to Cesar's or Bellagio.",

The carving station offers multiple options to choose from including sausage, turkey breast, and ham. Also have numerous sauces and other items such as caramelized onions with which you can top your carved selection.  Sadly, the sushi section is pretty poor, no shrimp, and wouldn't think about eating any of their rolls. At least have shrimp.   My other beef is the dessert section is pretty minimal with only the basics such as pie, ice cream, cookies and the like.  Have always found the servers to be helpful and friendly.

    "text": "$13.99 pp with Players card for a Sunday night buffet?  Not bad.  This buffet is located inside the Red Rock Casino Resort which is a really nice hotel/casino in a suburb called Summerlin.  This Buffet offers a little bit of everything which why it's a perfect place to bring a crowd where everyone can't decide what to eat. You'll find Asian, Italian, Homestyle, Southern, and Mexican kitchens serving up various entrees.  For dessert your kids will love the assortment of pies, cookies, ice-cream and cupcakes.  For those watching your waistline a huge salad bar with fruits, cheeses and salads and soups allows you to maintain your figure in the land of FOOD.  I had the roast beef and mashed potatoes and broccolini which sadly fell short on tasting like any kind of broccoli I've ever had-yucky.  My child had some fish, macaroni and cheese, Cesar salad, ribs, roast beef, shrimp, dumplings, steamed broccoli, egg roll and fried shrimp...he came with an appetite.    Meanwhile my picky eater had a slice of pepperoni pizza, a breadstick and a scoop of chocolate ice-cream for dessert, so I didn't exactly get my money's worth on him!  Overall the food was tasty, service was friendly and the buffet has lots to choose from.    My only complaint is at the dessert kitchen. They only had one server who seemed SO BOTHERED to serve anyone a piece of pie or a scoop of ice-cream. She didn't say one word to us or any other customer, no smile, nothing!  She made us feel like we were bothering her and begging for pie! Unacceptable! Please send Ms. Grouchy to the back to get her meds and keep her away from customers!  Her poor attitude didn't keep us from getting dessert-but it didn't offer quite the happy ending we would have liked.  Overall, not a bad place to bring your out-of-town guests who are dying for a \"local\" buffet experience.",

    "text": "***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 61/100***  I have been to this buffet several times both lunch and dinner. It's not the best buffet around but for the price it'll do. There are far more inferior places in some of the casinos on the strip that charge you twice if not triple the price. Breakfast is $6.99, Lunch $8.99 and Dinner $13.99 prices are with players card discount so make sure you grab one before you head down to the buffet, it gives you $2 off. Children 2 years and over are full price.  Last Saturday we went for brunch, after waiting in line for what seemed forever, we finally got in around 11 am. They were just starting to put away breakfast items to give way to lunch fare. Surveying the selections I didn't see much that was appealing to the senses but I managed to snag some waffles, bacon and some potatoes for the little one. I tried their Spinach benedict, the taste was just okay, but at least the yolk was runny and not overcooked. Chorizo and egg was good and they had all the trimmings to make a breakfast burrito so that was a plus. The omelet station was super busy so I skipped that. I decided to try some Asian offerings and actually liked it: Tom yum soup, good broth and didn't skimp on vegetables and shrimp but I would've preferred to have it a little spicier like the ones you get at the Thai restaurants (no option for it) The chicken with green curry was very tasty and satiating. The pork bun was good as well, again not skimping on the filling. Great bun to filling ratio.   The dessert station underwhelmed me though, was very disappointed with the selection, rather the lack of choices. I thought they would at least have creme brulee, that would've made me a happy camper already. All they had were a couple of unappetizing slices of cakes, gelatos, cookies that looked stale as heck and bread pudding. So I settled for a scoop of coffee gelato and a brownie. Gelato was too sweet instead of the somewhat bitter taste you would expect from coffee.",

The Tom Yum soup was extra coconut and oily. The sushi lacked luster and had the consistency of being store bought. After dinner we had to quickly go back to the room where I had diarrhea three times that night.   This section is for the people I encountered. At the Spaghetti section, an idiot clearly cut in front of me in line pretending he didn't know better. At the Jambalaya section a woman couldn't wait so she side step me and grabbed he Jambalaya. At the Sushi section, as I reached down to grab my plate a obnoxious man over took my space and helped himself to the sushi. I'm sure this is not the first time these people have been to a buffet but too many rude people tonight.",

We were rang up before 11am which meant our bill was about $50 for 4 people - aka $11.99 per person!!! An amazing price for an AYCE buffet! We didn't get seated until around 10:55 and by that time, all the breakfast stuff was getting taken out and lunch stuff was being moved in.   The food is pretty decent for $12 a person and we were pretty full for the rest of the day! This is like your typical buffet with a variety of food and also a carving station. They also have gelato which was really neat!   Overall I want to come back for their actual breakfast to try it out! Our server Miguel was the sweetest and we loved him!

Since we haven't eaten here for such a long time, we decide to treat ourselves on a Tuesday night.  We arrived the buffet line at 7:30 pm and there were close to 25 people in front of us. But it didn't take long for us to get seated, we only waited for about 10 minutes. The place wasn't very full, maybe 75% occupied. The wall decoration looks the same and the food selection hasn't changed much over the years.  The standard fare such as roast beef, roast turkey, pasta, sushi, cocktail shrimp, salads and desserts all looked inviting.  Of course, we stuff ourselves and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Our waitress was attentive and cleared away our dishes promptly.  Now, I remember why we haven't been to any buffets for such a long time.  We ate way too much.  For those who haven't been to this buffet, I would recommend giving it a try.  There's something for everyone here.",

I don't think anywhere else can really beat this price with the quality and variety they offer.   Get the players card. One card will discount 2 people. You will pay the boarding pass preferred once you show your card.  It's a fairly nice atmosphere. Of course it's in a casino hotel so you can hear the casinos depending on where you sit.  The waiters are really friendly and keeps and eye whether you want to refill your soda, coffee, tea.  There's usually roast turkey, chicken, pork, and roast beef which they freshly cut it in front of you. When it becomes dinner time (after 4pm), the custom pasta is pretty good with shrimp. This itself makes up the price you pay.  My family likes to go around 2-3pm when there's no line. Don't go on any holidays like thanksgiving, Christmas, you will have to wait for 1-2 hours depending on the time you get there.  It has a good variety for vegetarian. Nice salad bar with roasted vegetables and beans.  There's also no sugar dessert, but you just have to ask for it at the cake counter.",

    "text": "It is Friday, May 25, 2:07 PM, and I just finished eating dessert. I am still sitting at the table in the buffet as I want to reflect on my mediocre buffet experience while it's still fresh to my unsatisfied pallet.  We have a limited amount of meals to enjoy in this lifetime. Unfortunately this was a meal wasted that I can never get back.  There are multiple sections of the buffet so let's break down the mediocrity.  Sushi: don't even waste a single bite. I'm a big sushi eater, and this sushi is a waste of your calories. There's 1 boat of a variety of sushi with dried up hard rice. I risked it and tried some raw rolls as well and they were decent, but we'll see later today how my stomach fares. The sushi isn't even made fresh. It's all placed from a sheet pan with plastic on top that was pre-made and look like leftovers from the previous day.  International: What international? Some pita bread and hummus, baba ganoush, and a few curry dishes? Not impressed...  Asian: it's okay I guess. They have an Asian chef manning the kitchen and the food is good, but nothing special.  I can eat at Panda Express any time. When I come to a buffet I want to be wow'd!  Barbeque (yes they spell it with que): nothing extravagant either. Meat is dry. And they serve a lot of food that's there to make you full faster like baked potato, yams, mashed potatoes, and loaded mashed potatoes.  American: Interestingly enough I found myself eating from this section the most. The macaroni and cheese was the best dish I ate here today. Stroganoff was okay, the meat needs to be more tender. Chicken meatloaf is tasteless and a waste of calories.  Italian: A disgrace to Italian food. The worst pizza I ever had was at Olive Garden (never order pizza from there) but this buffet's \"pizza\" may look like a pizza but tastes like cardboard. I'd go with DiGiorno any day over this abomination of what they call pizza. The ingredients are fine, and they even use a brick oven! But the dough must be mediocre somehow...don't waste your time.  Pasta dishes are ehh, and sausage and peppers is ehh.  Pastries: Nothing blew me out of the water. Costco cookies are better than the cookies here.  Desserts: I have to say, their hand scooped gelato saves them. I would pay the $10.99 that we paid for lunch just for AYCE gelato to try all of the flavors. I tried Stracciatella (which they described as cookies and cream but it's more like vanilla with chocolate chunks) and strawberry, and they were on point.  With some apple cobbler, bread pudding, and chocolate and caramel sauce that you can add on, like I said, I'd pay $10.99 just for the gelato buffet alone.  Service was terrible. We had to ask the waitress for straws multiple times because when we got refills, she kept taking the old drinks with the straws in them. Then the new straws she'd give were bent or ripped or both...I also ordered sparkling water and there were pieces of crust or something in them from a not fully clean glass.  Would I go back? Yes, only because of the affordable price (when you show your Red Rock boarding pass/card) of $10.99 for lunch, but set your expectations low and you'll have a decent meal.  I didn't talk about the 'Farmers Market' section with various soups, salads, and fruit--this section is pretty good. It's what you'd expect.  I'm also tired of typing on my phone and I think you get the idea of what to expect when you come to this buffet.",

    "text": "I was profoundly disappointed with the food. We arrived around 11:30 am and had a chance to sample food from all the sections.  1. Sushi was barely edible. I would suppose that the sushi would be fresher since lunch was just getting started. It was dry and chewy, not good words that describe good Sushi.  2. Mexican food- Very untraditional selection. No guacamole to try and the green sauce pork was not flavored properly. Tomatillos are bitter and when not cooked and seasoned properly they made food taste bitter.  3. Had a slice of pork and it felt slimy. I could not eat it after a couple of bites.  4. Mashed potatoes were super buttery and creamy.  5. The egg drop soup was also inedible.  6. The Salmon was well cooked and seasoned.  7. Dessert - I had the Sugar free cheesecake, super yummy. Red velvet cake, very plain. Coconut cake, fluffy and moist. Sugar free lemon cake, it was dense and frosting was dry. Lemon Sorbet, just the right type of sweet treat to end the meal.  Overall service was good and little to no wait to get in. But the food was nothing to be desired in the near future.",

However, nobody comes to a buffet for the salad bar! All the salads were super fresh & the beet carpaccio was excellent. And the asparagus salad was pretty great as well.   Cons: Prime rib was over cooked. Even the \"rare\" slices hardly had any red meat in them. The sushi was lackluster. Orange chicken was really bland. None of the hot food was good.   I just feel like for $23/person, the food should at least be good. But it's hard to get your money's worth when all you eat is the produce.",

    "text": "Preface:  Nice setting, bright lighting. Always busy, hence good food turn over.  Average buffet-type food. Some items good, some not-so good, but inconsistent in quality. Great bargain, except pricier on Fridays and weekends.    A part of the Stations Casino brand, the Feast is located inside the Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa, a locals casino in the Westside of Las Vegas, next to the new Downtown Summerlin. The Feast Buffet comes nowhere close to a mega-huge glam buffet like the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's, but it's good for what it is, a locals' buffet.  It's my favorite of all the Stations' casino buffets.  Hubby and I typically spend an couple of hours lingering here, getting food, eating, chatting, repeat.  It's really an enjoyable setting, and that's what we really like the most.  My one vexation is the inconsistency in food quality.  There doesn't seem to be a basic formula the cooks all follow.  On the same night, as different batches of chow mein are brought out, for example, every batch looks and taste different. One batch might be dark, soy-sauced covered, and another light in color, with a totally different taste.  Unfortunately, because of this, it's difficult to even recommend certain items.  You just need to wander, see what appeals to you, and give it a try. I've never ever liked their sushi though, and would not recommend that at all. However, there's usually one or two standout items to choose from, being that there's an Italian, American, and Asian station, along with a couple of carving stations serving up turkey, brisket, steak, etc., depending on the day.  The salad bar is huge, and is one area where they excel in consistency.  For the money, it's worthwhile just making yourself a large salad, getting a slice of turkey and then splurging calorically on dessert.    One thing for sure, you will get value here.  For locals, they're always sending out 2 for 1 coupons, valid Mondays through Thursdays.  For dinner this evening, we paid a total of $18.39 for 2 people, that's $9.19 per person, if you show your Player's Card, which can be a card at even the most basic level.  This includes bottomless sodas, iced tea, and hot tea.  Really, how can you beat this deal?!?   We normally avoid Fridays and weekends here, since we're not huge shrimp and prime rib folks, which is their special on these days. There's also an additional charge, something like $19.99, but don't quote me on this price. You can get about 80 percent of these exact items Mondays through Thursdays for about half the price.  Although the Feast can't be defined as  destination-worthy, it certainly is worth a trip here if you find yourself in the Westside, or maybe after a shopping excursion at Downtown Summerlin.  After dining here, you can also catch a movie at the cinemas located by the food court, or make a \"donation\" at the casino.  We always end up doing one or the other.",

We stood in line for no longer than 10 minutes for Sunday Brunch and was sat right away.  Our server was so sweet.  She took our drink orders and let us enjoy our meal.  This buffet is pretty good.  Very nice and clean with lots of options.  They've got Japanese (sushi), Chinese, Italian, american, and other stations.  What a bang for your buck!! As I was looking around at the buffet, I ran into the chef and spoke to her.  I believe her name was Dani??? Danielle?? Daniella?? I'm so sorry I totally forgot!! But she was the sweetest.  She is also from Hawaii.  She helped me out with the buffet on how It works and what options there are.  She even spoke to my family at the table.  Us locals love talking to other locals out here.    Anyways, my family enjoyed the food here and thank you to our server and the chef for making us feel welcomed and taken care of.  Will definitely return to bring all my friends and family here to eat!   I'm sorry no photos :( next time I will try to post some!",

    "text": "My family lives near Red Rock Casino and we have been to the Feast Buffet at least a dozen times over the past couple of years. We had a big group in town for my grandfather's 95th birthday party and decided to eat at the buffet on Labor Day. The hostess informed us that we wouldn't be able to sit at one table unless we were willing to pay a 15% gratuity fee. We declined to sit at one table. The hostess took my grandfather and several others to the first table. There were five more of us waiting to be seated. When the hostess returned, I asked her if we could sit near my grandfather, in the same section at least so we could all be near each other. She did not even respond to me. Instead, she had another hostess lead us to the exact opposite end of the restaurant. I again asked the new hostess if we could sit in the same area as our family and she said there just wasn't room near them. I went over 5 minutes later to find at least 5 empty tables in the same section as my family. My grandfather actually ended up not even eating as he was so upset.   The hostesses (and manager we spoke to as well) need a lot more training in customer service skills. I wish your employees would consider the needs of their customers more. They had the opportunity to make a 95 year old, WWII veteran's birthday and instead chose to be inflexible and rude towards our group. I honestly expected more from a Station Casino. Even if your employees felt like they were unable to accommodate our needs, speaking to others with dignity and respect is important. Some compassion and flexibility would be greatly appreciated.",

These days, the food selection is limited, a lot of it looks dry or unappetizing, and tastes slightly better than airline food.   But even worse, the customer service is THE WORST EVER!!!  I'll start with the Pasta station guy. When he wanted to tell me it was my turn to order, you know what he called me? \"CHINA\"!!!! (I was like WTF?!? I know I'm ASIAN but what's wrong with \"next, Miss, Ma'am, etc???) Then without asking he dumped a bunch of hot pepper flakes on the pasta and they're supposed to ask you if you want hot pepper and when I told him I can't have hot pepper it's for the baby he gave such an attitude when he threw the pan out to be washed. He had a scowl on his face the whole time. NEVER has anyone in hospitality addressed me like that!!!   When I informed the Mgr she just asked me to fill out the comment card. On top of that, when I first got to my table they had wiped it off and my entire table was still soaking wet. I had to ask for paper napkins to dry the table! And, the service was very slow.   This is the second time in 1 month I've had customer service issues there. We've definitely cut this place out.",

The hot tip is to sign up for Station Casino's \"Boarding Pass\" players club card [free] I saved $5 off of dinner buffet with players card and since the sign up gave me free slot play, I used it on my way out and won $8 bucks, so my dinner cost $5.99 [normal price is $18.99]  Considering that the cost was so minimal, it was a good value. I normally dont like buffets, but not totally opposed to them. This one is not one of the better buffets, it's typical of most average buffets.

While GVR is still good (not as good as it was before the price drops, but still good) Red Rock is NOT GOOD.  Several of the Stations $9.99 buffets put the Red Rock to shame.  The last 3 visits were terrible.  The last straw was for Thanksgiving dinner.  Nothing tasted good, and the variety was a joke.  They had advertised many things on the special Thanksgiving menu.  Well, let me just say that the 'Barbecue Shrimp' was the small cold cocktail shrimps drown in nasty cold bbq sauce.  Who thinks that's Barbecue Shrimp?  And the 'Lamb Chops' were just hunks of lamb roast plopped onto your plate.  And the sushi... SUSHI?  What sushi??  Mini tuna rolls and thats it?  You get the idea.  I understand that when they lowered the price about a year ago, that the variety and quality would go down.  But this one isn't worth any amount of money.  And the $18.99 for Thanksgiving was just ridiculous.  The ONLY saving grace was that we skipped the looooong 1-2 hour lines with the President card.  3 strikes and you're out!  We will definately NOT be back.",

It was relatively inexpensive and good quality food but what really stood out was the customer service. It was above par and I was satisfied with my price to quality ratio. I felt like my money went far here as compared to the strip buffets. I would still rather prefer Wicked Spoon over this, but I have yet to try Feast Buffet for dinner.",

    "text": "This Buffet was good depending on what you get. We paid around 7 bucks per person for breakfast. The price goes up depending what time of day you go. I went around Brunch time as they were changing out the food from breakfast to lunch. They have sections like international, sushi, american, asian, pastries etc. The breakfast / lunch was delicious, so much to choose from. Some things were definitely bland but overall it was good.   Round one was waffles, sausage, bacon, hash browns and chilaquiles. The shredded hash browns were good but the oval one I got was stale, i'm guessing because it was sitting there for awhile. The waffle was a bit hard. The chilaquiles were better than i expected. The bacon was delicious. The sausage not so much.   Round two was a pizza slice, mac n cheese, some steak meat, fried rice, fried pork, some noodles, and I forgot what else. so much! The pizza was alright. The steak meat looked good but didn't appeal to my taste buds when I took the first and last bite. The mac and cheese was mediocre. I enjoyed the chinese food more so than the rest. The fried pork was good.   The desert round included some fruit, cookies and a cinnamon roll. It was all good and there is nothing to complain about.   I wish i had the stomach capacity to try everything. What I got was only 40% of what they offer.   The one thing I didn't like was waiting on the water to bring me a refill of soda. I mean it's a buffet, why not have the soft drinks available right there as well?   I also overheard a lot of elderly folk saying their table was too far from the buffet, which can be an issue for the elderly or disabled but I didn't have a problem with that.   I do recommend this place. Everyone's taste is different. I happen to be sort of a picky eater.",

    "text": "I think the sad sad day has finally arrived when gorging myself to the point of bursting is no longer appealing.  There was a time when my Vegas experience wasn't complete without rolling myself out of a buffet, but I've grown wiser (and thinner).  I came here twice over the weekend while staying at Red Rock - once for dinner and once for brunch. Both were $16.99 after the $2 player's club discount and we also had coupons for 1 free buffet and 2 for 1. So for the 3 of us, it ended up only costing $6/person. That's cheaper than McDonalds! You should check the local paper because there are always coupons.   It was slightly disconcerting that the food at dinner and brunch was mostly the same, but it's not often that I have the opportunity to eat prime rib for breakfast. There are tons of choices from Italian to Asian, Barbeque, Sushi and \"International\" (which appears to be mostly Mexican). The prime rib is very good, but some of the other foods were a little dried out. The tortillas were like cardboard and the biscuits shattered into a million crumbs when I tried to split one. I also liked the mashed potatoes and tapioca pudding - I know, I know, I can't help it, I love cheap carbs.   Service was very good and our plates were always cleared quickly and drinks were refilled. I'll probably come back if I stay at Red Rock again, but I might be steering clear of buffets for a little while.",

There was a horrible line issue once, and the servers are sometimes slow to refills on drinks, clearing plates, etc.  The Red Rock PP card is the way to go if you are going to eat here. The prices are pretty reasonable. The Saturday breakfast is nice, and the Sunday buffets are a treat. It is also awesome getting the B1G1 coupons in the mail.  We have been other times to eat, but not for the Friday or Saturday night Seafood/Prime Rib buffets. The selection of food is always good. There is change of items, but the favorites always remain.  I wish the kids buffet price was a little bit cheaper. We have a small child who can be a picky eater, so it is often not a good value for him to eat.  Overall, the Feast Buffet in Red Rock is a great choice and value for the people of Summerlin. It is always busy when we're there.",

Walking back and forth and the food was just horrible. Old, dried and not fresh. The carving station was all overcooked so it was hard and chewy. There wasn't much protein to select. Mac and cheese was very powdery (if that's a word). The best thing to eat was their pizza, garlic bread. and mint chocolate chip ice cream. The salad station was lacking as they never did refill what was gone. All in all, it was a waste of gas (since I do not live close to it) and a waste of money. Will never come back here again!",

The resort is nice, clean, and not too crowded.  After staying on the strip the last couple of times, this spot is much more convenient.  I'd probably still stay on the strip if I was with my wife though, since there are no shows or fancy restaurants at the Red Rock.  That being said, I was really disappointed with the Feast Buffet.  It was about $22 which is not expensive, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the food.  I ate a little of everything, and nothing was particularly good.  Sushi was worse than what I can get at my local Ralphs.  The BBQ ribs were dry.  Hardly any fish to chose from.  Asian section was about as good as panda express.  Really, nothing great about it.  I was more excited about the Fat Burger that I got in the casino food court.  Come to think of it, I also got a great prosciutto sandwich in the casino too.  Next time, I will try the bbq place instead.    BTW, if you are staying at the Red Rock.  There's a great Whole Foods down the street that has a lot of prepared food.  You can pick up really good stuff there and bring it back.  Also, across the street was an Italian pizza/deli that was good too.",

Now, THAT is luck!  And so was this buffet that my parents and kids enjoyed.  It was so huge it felt like Epcot Center with different ethnic food presentations.  There was a dedicated section for sushi, mexican, chinese, italian, western american, and nice slices of beef and whole baked chickens.  My favorite was the shredded bar-b-que, green beans and tamale!!  The dessert section was standard but delicious!  There was a nice selection of unique and traditional gelato flavors from mango sherbet to strawberry.  The food was flavorful unlike so many buffets that taste like they made mashed potatoes from a box.  No, this place is worth having a meal.  It's about $10/person for lunch which includes unlimited choice of non-alcoholic beverages.  Three stars for the fact that: 1) My kids ate well 2) The atmosphere was nice 3)  And I ate well!!

The price is 10 something but if you have a players card (only good for 2 people) they give you a discount, so it ended up being 7 or 8 bucks for a breakfast buffet. The quality was pretty decent and it was convenient because we stayed here.  If we were to drive somewhere and get a meal, would have been 10 bucks easily.  So this made a lot of sense. Key items I repeated were the french toast, eggs benedict, pancake style hash brown.  I didn't want to wait for the omelet line because I was starving.  Will have to check it out next time.",

Didn't mind the lines after I was able to try their food. Their Asian Selection was huge! There was oxtail soup, mussels, clams and oysters...   Their other stations were good too but standard when compared to what you'll find in Vegas.   I will add that service was excellent. Servers came and refilled drinks quickly and took plates as well as utensils away as soon as they were available.   The dessert selection was good too!   If you find yourself in Red Rock or the Charleston Area in Vegas, you'll need to visit this place. Be sure to come hungry and prepared to sit for a while.",

I have strict dietary needs and the chef always does a walk through for me to tell me what I can eat and what to stay away from. With a players card you don't have to wait in the long line. They are always busy but never a long wait, except for when they have buy one get one on certain days.   I wish they changed their menu more often but their dishes are consistent in taste and quality . I usually go right at 11 and there is always fresh food.! They have a huge salad and fruit bar and every dessert you could ask for! Even though I can't eat any of it except the Italian ice. The first time I came they had a coconut dairy free ice and never saw it again, it was delicious.   The decorations in the place are also appealing to the eye.   I eat everything with chopsticks, even my Italian ice and sweet potato :)",

They were choosing some healthy food options also, which is rare.  The made dishes were also top notch.  Had some flavour to them.  Service was also better here than most as our drinks were always topped up.  Our server must have been by 5-6 times over the meal.  We'll be back.",

After being seated I went around and the big hunk of ham caught my attention. I just had to have a slice of that yumminess. So I stood and waited for the two ladies who were busy taking out the breakfast items and putting their display in front of me. No one bothers looking at me. So I patiently wait still. Then, there were 2 of us , before long there were 8 people lining up for the million dollar ham. It's like waiting for Mariah Carey and Celine Dion to finally acknowledge our presence. Ridiculous! So I say, Excuse me miss, I just need a small slice of of ham pls. NADA...crickets. They keep unloading and talking in Spanish. How rude! By that time I didn't really want the ham anymore, but I had to have it in principle. Finally a young guy with a chef's hat comes over and smiles at me. He looked new and asks one of the witches what he should do, I tell him I want some ham, they show him how to cut the freaking ham THE WRONG WAY and the guy had to figure it out on his own. So I get my ham and vowed NEVER to return.   In fairness, all the people we came in contact with except for the two Divas  were very nice and friendly especially our server Tes.  Food wise, the shrimp ceviche, the pork curry, the pork bao and the coconut cream pie were pretty good. Skip the tomato bisque, it's grainy.",

Only seafood you'll get are dried up salmon or cod (at American station), super tiny shrimp w/nasty marinara sauce (at sushi station), sauteed clams in bean sauce(at Asian station). Maybe it was that particular night that I went, but nothing tasted like it was supposed to be. For instance prime rib was super chewy, chicken tasted like rubber, grape tomatoes at the salad bar was...unexplainable, even mozzarella cheese - at the salad station - did not taste like cheese. I'm not a picky eater and LOVE all sorts of cuisine. However, quality of food here is horrible.  This was not my first time here, but I'm considering it to be my last. Other buffets, at a less fancier resorts have been better.   Waiters are always attentive though - you will not go thirsty.",

Most Station Casino buffets are geared toward the old, smoker, bingo crowd - who generally don't appreciate seasoned foods.  Maybe because this doesn't sit smack dab in the middle of a Sun City, the selection is better flavored.  Even though my parents live within spitting distance of Green Valley, they tend to drive all the way over here to eat at this buffet, but apparently the Chanukah menu was just okay here.   Anyway, on 3/13/14 I had a 2 for 1 coupon here and my dad and I had lunch for $7.99. Not a bad deal!",

It's 15-20 away from the strip but it's worth it. Dinner was good but the breakfast was great.  I can't forget about their staff.....friendly and caring especially towards families with kids.

I figured we'd give Red Rock a try since it's supposedly just as good as Green Valley Ranch's Feast Buffet. BOY was I upset yesterday (1/27/2014).  First of all, I have allergies to a lot of things.. Wheat, corn, peanuts, sesame seeds, and walnuts are the worst. I try my best to avoid anything of the sort unless it's a cheat day and I can sneak by eating something with a bun.  After we paid we ordered our drinks with our waitress who seemed nice.  I then walk up to the american section and I had a question and I'm watching these two cooks yucking it up and chatting just ignoring me. Finally I say to them, \"I have a QUESTION.\"  The guy loses his smile and says to me \"what can I do for you MA'AM?\"  (I'm only 24).  I asked him \"do you have cook to order Philly cheese steaks here?\"  I was feeling froggy and wanted to cheat my diet and enjoy a night out with the family.  So he snaps back at me, \"NO, we have cook to order PASTA down there\".   Okay really I'm SORRY I interrupted YOUR hysterical story!  I didn't even bother complaining because I know this guy's attitude was I could CARE LESS!  Pasta is a dime a dozen and I felt it wasn't worth the itchy hives I would experience.   I go to the Taco section and made myself a taco... The flour tortilla was hard as a rock and the beef was really watery. I should of known by the way this started it wasn't going to get any better.. So I look for greens like Broccoli and sure enough I found some it was fairly edible. I ended up eating Mashed potatoes and Broccoli for the remainder of my visit.  Everything else wasn't worth the break out since it had been cooking under the heat lamps to the point where it just looked old and gross.  Each time I went up I checked to see if they had put out a fresh batch it was the same old batch.  I just gave up and wanted to leave, so I felt disgusted and felt like hitting the slots.. hoping it would perk me up.  Judging by the reviews I wasn't the only one who was upset about the quality of food.  (referring to Ridin S. date posted 1/5/2014)  Shame on me for thinking you guys had stepped it up!  GRR what a waste of my free buffet.  Glad to know you value of food has gone up and quality is right where it's always at, crappy.",

It would've been a 5-star experience if not for the hours-long line and additional long waits at the carving stations.  I think they should've had the carving stations set up separately from the other foods - although I think that wouldn't be possible given that they will grill meats upon request and therefore must be by the grills). But long lines at the carving stations did slow access to much of the Thanksgiving goodies.   Amongst us we had lamb (very strong tasting. My partner didn't like that it was so pale and tender), steak, turkey, bbq chicken and fried chicken. Also, green beans (slightly crisp and not overlooked at all), broccoli (same thing), au gratin potatoes, deliciously garlicky cheese bread,  mashed potatoes and stuffing (both very good!) with gravy, cranberry sauce and a few other things. I noticed the International stations were practically empty as we all stormed the Thanksgiving  area.   Anyway, I think if I came here again I'd prefer to be a VIP so I wouldn't have to wait for two hours to eat, but it was damn good food.",

As far as dairy-free options go not to great here. though thankfully they did actually have lemon sorbet which is a pleasant surprise considering that every other buffet I have gone to has had no dairy free options for dessert.  all in all not the best but they have been too but definitely not the worst and for the weekday price it definitely seems worth the money. I'll be sure to have the players club card that way you can get the rate for that. Otherwise it can be rather expensive especially on the weekends.",

It is secluded and beautiful! Very well taken care of.   When we arrived there was a line of people and it was early for lunch around 11:25ish.. however the line moved along very quickly! The moment we were seated our drink orders were taken and we were free to graze on as many items as we wanted!  Indian, Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Sandwiches you name it they have it! They also had a large delicious salad bar. I'm usually not a big soup and salad girl but I was really impressed with the salads freshness and soup was delicious! Their bread was stale though.   I loved their chow mein I could've had more but I explored so many food options I thought the last thing I needed was another serving of anything. Their guacamole was okay however their Italian food was delicious.   I was most disappointed in the chocolate cake I had very dry almost like it was a few days old. However the cookie I had was superb and I knew I should've had their pie. They only had about 6 different options just of the pie!   The service was great and the actual food was great. This was just as good maybe even better than the MGM buffet I had last year.",

I did shrimp scampi with tons of cheese. My second plate consisted of different types of meats and sushi. They have all types of ethnic foods like Asian, Mexican, Italian, etc.   The service is always quick and speedy. If you ever need anything your server is always right around the corner to assist.   I was too full for deserts but they have different types of ice creams and pastries to chose from.   Parking is quick and easy. It is located inside the Red Rocks Casino and Hotel.

Breakfast buffet is $12.99 if you don't have a players card which is still a really good deal.  They have pretty much all of the standard breakfast fare and when I went they were just starting to transition to the lunch food.  I'm not really a breakfast person so I enjoyed the lunch food more. They had sushi, Asian food, pizza and a meat station that had ham, chicken and pork.  It's not the best quality but for the price the selection was really good and everything was clean.  If you're on a budget this would be a good place to try.  2019 - 21/50",

We made it just on time for breakfast and lucky for us we stayed for lunch. There is a 2 hour limit at the tables so if you want to try 2 for 1 I would suggest going late enough but early enough to get the 1st meal. We enjoyed almost everything. I opt for the scramble eggs & egg Benedict. Both were not great. I should have just wait in the omelette line. There are 2 omelette stations. One on each end which I didn't know had I know I would have gone up to faster side. Everything else was pretty decent. I really enjoyed the polenta & Cappuccino gelato.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Feast Buffet was several years ago, and I actually remember enjoying the food and overall experience. So when I heard that my cousin's family was hosting her graduation lunch there, I was pretty stoked and looking forward to it. Unfortunately my latest visit didn't compare as the food and customer service were sub par.  The buffet consists of different food stations including sushi, Asian, Mexican, BBQ, American, International, Farmers Market, pastries, and desserts. When I went around first to look at my choices, there was nothing that really stood out for me. I also question the food groupings that were there.   Our reservation started at 1pm. I was expecting to see lunch dishes, but I was pretty disappointed that a good portion of the buffet was still serving breakfast. The American station, for example, was only serving brunch. Would've been nice to have a variety of lunch items like sliders or something.   Let's be honest here, Feast Buffet, the barbecue section didn't really have barbecue. There was fried chicken, country fried steak, a top round carving station, and other random breakfast items like mini breakfast sausages and country fried steak. Where were the brisket, pulled pork, smoked chicken, ribs, etc. that would typically be considered barbecue? The top round cut was so dry too. All the chimichurri and horseradish I put on the roast beef couldn't salvage it.   All great buffets have a seafood station, which is what Feast Buffet lacks. I did see that there was a place to get fresh shrimp cocktail section in the Sushi area but that's about it.   Our waitress was a nice lady but extremely forgetful. I had to ask her for water multiple times. My sister and I asked for mimosas, which she was totally fine with. The next time she passed by she took our flutes away. I presumed that she took our flutes to go fill them, but she never came back with them. When I asked the waitress for the status of our mimosas, she then asked to check our IDs. She had forgotten that we asked her for mimosas even though I saw her write it down on her notepad.",

Ages 4 and over are $10.99 (overpriced considering my 4 year old eats about 3 bites & is done.)  The food here is really good, & better than most buffets in the area.  They have different types of food, clearly identified by signs above:  Italian, American, Asian, Latin... I did not see any seafood, however.  They have a great salad/fruit bar, plenty of vegetarian options, and foods that range from different kinds of pizzas, sushi, gourmet quesadillas, pastas, rotisserie chicken, etc. more sides than I can list.  Service is surprisingly efficient with drink requests & dish-clearing. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful too.  The line can be LONG. I highly suggest timing your visit around peak mealtimes.  Closest restrooms are just outside of the restaurant, to the left. They are closer than the ones to the right.",

The lunch buffet did not have mashed potatoes.  A buffet staple!    They had hard baked potatoes instead.  Yuck. They said the mashed potatoes were served at dinner.   The desserts were good, but the pieces of pie were large so you couldn't try two.   I think we can take this one off our lunch buffet list.",

I googled this buffet and the online schedule indicated it was open until 3; I was really excited about this and promptly headed over to the casino.   I get to the buffet at 2:40 and the line is closed. Won't reopen until 3:30. Several of the people that were attempting to get brunch as well when I arrived were just as disappointed as I was. Our vision of the bubbly champagne was quickly shattered with this early random  closing on a busy Saturday.   The manager stated it was because they wanted to remove the items and make room for the new ones. The 30 minute closing span is intended for that. It's up to the manager and the team to make it happen. An effective manager will see to that. Or simple change the advertised time to reflect the time when you will actually close.   With all the multiple delicious options available in Las Vegas, I'm sure visitors and locals will find alternatives.",

Came here for Saturday brunch and overall the food was just ok. Again, it was nothing special. Not the worst buffet but for the price, probably not coming back again. For the brunch price, I was expecting a bit more variety than mostly breakfast food. Really disappointed that there was no beef at the carving station. The food lacked flavor. The meatballs were cold. Pizza crust was very thick and doughy. Desert station was minimal. Salad station was meh.   As a Summerlin resident, I desperately want to come here everyday. But instead, we drive 20-30 minutes to the strip.   For 2 adults and a child, we paid $57 for brunch. For the price, I'd much rather go to Aria weekend dinner with the entire family for $60 (ask for locals price and kids eat free) and have king & snow crab legs, almost 10 items at the carving station, best salad bar and much better desert station.   Please SCLV, make the Feast better so we don't have to drive to the strip.",

    "text": "We decided to come here on a Saturday for early Father's Day Lunch. Surprisingly, there wasn't a line like at the coffee shop. We were seated quickly and we began to feast. I started off on the \"sushi\" side. There was some spicy tuna rolls, California rolls, unagi nigri and shrimp nigri. None of which was even remotely good. I then decided to try the mac and cheese (yes, I love mac and cheese) and rotisserie chicken at the carving station. This was both good, but some parts of the chicken was dry. I also had some chicken noodle soup and that was full of yummy deliciousness, probably full of MSG but it was good! I was full after that (it was only lunchtime!) and I went on to the dessert. I like that they have an ice cream bar here. However, this time I tried three different mini cupcakes the red velvet, chocolate and vanilla. They were all good, but not great. For the price of $9.99 for lunch and for those of you who have a boarding rewards card, I think its a go!",

    "text": "Ok so not my favorite, I'm not a huge buffet girl in the first place but this one has numerous problems.  I went on a Sunday morning for their brunch which includes a complimentary mimosa [yum].  1) ordered coffee-got no spoons to stir it :( 2) they have sushi on the buffet at 9 am?  that's weird 3) they had a bowl of watermelon by the Asian sauces?  just seemed really out of place 4) Oxtail wasn't bad and the mini spinach quiche was good too-everything else was average or below average at best. Loaded mashed potatoes were pretty good too. 5) Pepper shrimp were way overcooked and dried out resembled beef jerky and they weren't peeled so you had to do that process 6) fried rice was the saltest thing I've ever tasted in my life 7) only one guy making omelets- needed more people. And sadly the omelet guy was right smack in the middle of one of the buffet rows. The Italian one to be exact?  Why there I have no idea makes no sense? AND the other issue was there was a line of like 10-15 people which backed up over all the Italian food [again had like a bunch of lunch or dinner items at 9 am in the morning????) Row went like this breakfast calzone, pancakes, pizza, omelet guy, Italian food. Pizza didn't look good either 8)  They had full salad bar out again, you betcha at 9 am [who eats salad at 9 am?]  They also had a full BBQ section out w/ like baby back ribs and fried chicken again it's 9 am? 9) for brunch I'd like to see more brunch things, eggs bennie, breakfast pizza, egg white and spinach something or egg whites in general.  Maybe some breakfast casseroles, chicken sausage, something.  There was just too much lunch at brunch and not enough breakfast options. Crab legs would've been nice too :)",

From raspberry vinaigrette beets, cous-cous feta salad, to sweet potato salad they push there salad bar into  interesting. They  even had German selections for Octoberfest.! The prime rib is very nicely done(with a selection of rare to well) and you can't beat it for the money. The ribs/chicken bbq items have a very nice rub and smoky flavor and are worth a try. The pies are from a local baker and very good. wait staff and decor very nice, clean and well run!",

    "text": "I've been here many times and never thought to review it.  As far as Vegas buffets go, it's a good one.  The price is pretty reasonable when you look at the price places like Bellagio and M are charging.  But you get less of the high ticket items at dinner which is the one this review is based on.  Once they let you in, they have an Asian, American, BBQ, Mexican, Italian, dessert and salad items each at different spaces with nice big signs over each (except for the soup and salad bar which should be obvious...)  This place is always consistent too.  You can always count on the cocktail shrimp, a diminutive selection of sushi, Mexican items that have clearly been under the heat lamp too long, Italian food that has suffered the same fate, two selections of roasted meat that they will cut for you, fried chicken and shrimp, corn on the cob, some type of mashed potatoes, ice cream (low and full sugared).  I avoid all the starchy stuff, bread, pasta etc.  I also stay away from their dim sum.  Go here for the roasted meat, pot roast if you're lucky, fajita chicken, fried chicken (yum!), cocktail shrimp and if you're craving Italian, the meatballs.  I don't know why they don't always have spaghetti to go with them, but I won't complain.  More room to fit other good things!    The ambience is upscale for a buffet too.  Lots of tables.  Of course, buffet ettiquette being what it is, be on the lookout for that hundred foot gape on the faces of the crowd.  They'll swoop in in front of you or knock you to the floor altogether in their haste to pig out.  One couple lingered in front of the shrimp for several minutes, with the wife trying to convince her husband to \"just use your hands, just use your hands; they work!\"  Eww.    Fair warning:  The staff are pretty strict here about taking any food from the area and they're not particularly subtle.  Doesn't matter if it's one cookie or if you're stuffing shrimp in your pockets.  They let everyone know what you did!",

The price was great, the server was very polite. The food.. Well, the whole thing was like a pretty golden corral, if you've ever been to one.. The sushi was not prepared correctly, but you kind of expect that not to be too great, it's not an asian buffet. None of the other asian food really looked appetizing either.. The italian was ok, nothing more. The pizza tasted ok, but the crust was soggy. The prime rib, however, was delicious. Honestly, it seemed like they had all the right ingredients.. But the flavors for almost everything were just a little off, like they had good intentions but hired improperly trained chefs. Next time we go to Red Rock, we'll probably try something else, even if the price is higher.",

But if you're going as a tourist or taking your family and friends out to eat and show off Las Vegas, don't go here. There are waaaaaay better buffets out there than this.

Nothing had that can and plastic bag taste you get on the strip.In fact, the food was exceptional. And tasted sooo good. Like home made! Salad bar is even perfect and not over done. Use your player club card for a discount if you want. As this place is very very low priced for a buffet. 6-8 bucks isn't bad for all you can eat, and rare in Vegas these days, I would give this 5 stars. But this place has one major draw back. Crowded. The lines are so big, it can take a 1/2 hour to 45 min for a seat. It is just too popular. I do a lot of hiking in the Red Rock area. And then having to wait almost a hour to eat after a hike? LOL! I must admit. Its worth the wait even. Thanks Red Rock! Great Food---Great Price even!!",

We got there early on Saturday around 4:30 and almost everything was empty. But it really didn't matter because when they did replinish the food it was so bad that we wished we had not gone at all.   They don't have prime rib but instead \"roast beef\" which was so tough that it could not be chewed....desserts were mouths full of sugar....salads were limp from sitting so long and a piece of chicken one of us got was actually \"ice cold\" and white colored as in \"not cooked\".  The Mexican station had several soups and we asked for a bowl and they said we had to go over to the salad bar to get a bowl...what ????? same thing with the Chinese station and the egg drop soup...no bowls.  That pretty much sums up the lack of management in this place. We will NEVER go back and you would be wise not to either !!",

Excellent place to take the kids as the price is right and there are many food choices for kids (pizza, mac and cheese, sushi for my seven year old).

    "text": "So.... I made the huge mistake of coming to Feast on Thanksgiving Day with a group of friends.  This past Thanksgiving was our first in Vegas without our immediate family, so we thought we would do something fun & hit up a buffet for turkey dinner.  We got there early, around 3:30 p.m., to beat the dinner rush.  Hah! Two and a half hours later, we finally got into the buffet.  Once we all paid, we had to stand around for another 25 minutes waiting on a table to fit our 7 person party.  Once we finally sat down, we all headed to the buffet where we had to stand in line for ANOTHER 30 MINUTES just to get food.  The stations were so backed up, we were all eating in line when we finally got to whatever food we liked.  They were also running out of food.  Never again.  I will never, ever go to another buffet on Thanksgiving Day.  I know this isn't the norm & it was a holiday - yatta, yatta, yatta - but they should have been better prepared.  Next year, we will either be going somewhere that takes reservations or cooking at home.  Normally, this buffet is not that bad.  I've been there once before on a normal day & the service was great.  The food is mediocre.  They do have a lot of stations with a lot of international selections which is cool for people with different tastes.  & with a $10.99 price tag (with your casino rewards card), you can't really beat it.  Obviously, it's no Bacchanal, but it will do for a family who wants choices or the tourists staying at the hotel.  The best part - they have real gelato and it is delicious!",

Ice creams melt before i can get back to my table.  They also need more chef/servers in the dessert area.  No one is usually available to get my cheesecake for me since they keep it in a glass cooler as a display.    Overall, I gave it 4 stars because of the price.",

Shrimp cocktail are small, Asian menu is adequate and the prime rib and is standard/above average for a Vegas buffet.  The Mexican and Italian menus are standard to me as well. My two favorite dishes are their pulled pork and chocolate ice cream! I believe M Resort's buffet still has a slight edge over this one in terms of off the strip casino buffet as well as selection.

    "text": "Coming from me a 3-star buffet is pretty remarkable because a standard buffet for me is pretty much always 2-stars. Anything is better than a buffet! So, with that being said, I am generally satisfied with the selections at the Feast. I have had breakfast, lunch and even Thanksgiving here, and I have never left angry, which often happens when I am dining at a buffet.  They have all of the usual suspects. The salad bar is always fresh. While the flavors might not be amazing, nothing has ever been bad. The place is clean and well-organized. Definitely have your Station Card so that you can get your savings.   There isn't anything that stands out, like beer being included or some fancy mashed potato bar. Okay, maybe that was a bad example, but some buffets have something signature that really makes them stand out. For me, Feast Buffet is straightforward. It's a buffet done without failures, but without anything too remarkable. Wait, they do have kimchi! I find that pretty special, but for most, that's probably not too much to get excited about.",

All three have a large selection to choose from, and almost everything is high quality for this price buffet and everything is always fresh. If salads are your thing you will love the salad bar here. Selection at dinner buffet is very good however it would be great to get a nice thick cut of beef instead of something that looks like it came out of the slicer at the deli. Even when you ask for a thick slice it comes paper thin. They try very hard to be exotic at the lunch buffet but it would be nice to be able to get a fresh grilled hamburger for people like me.",

But my husband wanted to eat here for breakfast and so we did. And you know what? I liked it.  We didn't use a player's card when we paid and the two of us came to $17.00. There were a lot people eating but the line was short. We got in line at 9 am. I got a bagel and eggs and bacon and hashbrowns. And then the waitress forced me to eat a chocolate donut.  The food was good and it was fresh too. I guess when the buffet is so busy they are constantly preparing new food so nothing is out too long. When we were leaving the restaurant the line was insane, no way I would have waited in it if it was like that when we got there.",

Made to order omelets, eggs benedict, waffles, French toasts, potatoes, cheese blintz with fruit toppings. Fresh fruit, oatmeal- cream of wheat, grits- with raisins and brown sugar- salads- a bagel section with several flavors and cream cheese flavor choices.  Too much to choose!  Plus served both coffee and a huge glass of O.J.  for $6.99 with the players card a steal! Came right near the end of the breakfast so lunch items coming out and got to try some of those too.   Lunch was very good on another day. Stand outs were the turkey, stuffing, carved ham and stuffed pork. fall off the bone BBQ chicken, beef stew- Lots of salad choices- Mexican- chicken enchiladas, menudo, quesadillas- all the fixings you could ask for !  Hot and sour soup.. soups- ( sushi- don't eat it but lots of people were..) pasta, masala chicken, tortellini- nice sauces.. Oh, and save room for the coconut or banana or chocolate cream pies- toffee pudding was to die for- gelatos.. so much to eat- great selection and all for $8.99 a person.    Something for everyone. Lines go fast- worth the short wait.  Service was prompt- friendly and attentive!",

We still tipped well because it's a lot of work keeping up with us! There isn't a lot of seafood here but they have peeled shrimp and breaded shrimp. I liked the idea that you can request to have the peeled shrimp made into a Shrimp Scampi. They make it pretty good here ...it would come in second to The Cheesecake Factory's version of it. I also had the Prime Rib which they made really well this time. It wasn't too red and it melted in your mouth! Whenever I come here I have to make room for dessert because they have Gelato and fun little pastries. I like this place but I wish it would offer crab legs like Green Valley Ranch!",

The only bright side is, they have an excellent waiter named Alberto. If you should try the buffet as your last resort, ask for Alberto you won't regret it. (He works breakfast and Lunch)",

    "text": "Buffet located in the Red Rock Casino, one of the more popular places for Las Vegas residents to hang out. In addition to this buffet, they have a bowling alley, movie theater, etc. For dinner or Sunday brunch (with the player's card), it's a low $13.99. Came here with a buddy. Both of us were hungry. Both left satisfied.  Setting: Located within a casino. As such, there are a lot of smokers. As a result, it smells like smoke. I only mention this because a lot of my friends will purposely avoid areas that SIGNIFICANTLY increase your risk of lung (and esophageal, stomach, bladder, renal, etc.) cancer. That aside, you walk to the entrance where, at the time, only one cashier was working. It took about 25 minutes before we ended up reaching the front of the line. One of the major drawbacks to this dining experience was that there were two people working the cash register but only one appeared to be working. There were plenty of open tables so I can't really see how they'd justify not putting both to work. Oh well. The tables are widely spaced. Regardless, it's pretty loud in the dining area. Every table has great access to the food. Individual grade: 3  Waitress: The waitress who sat us down seemed like she hates her job. She responded appropriately with \"You're welcome\" but never once smiled or made eye contact. Just going through the motions. In stark contrast was the waitress that actually waited our table. She was warm, friendly, and always smiling. Plates were cleared quickly and cups were refilled when they dropped down to about 25% full. Individual grade: 3.5 stars (dropped because of the first apathetic employee)  Food: THERE WAS SO MUCH FOOD! International (Mexican), Asian (Chinese), sushi, BBQ, farmer's market (fruit, cheese, salads, bagels, and breads), and dessert. The sushi was not fresh, nor were they generous with the fish. That could be countered by just taking more pieces. The chinese food was unoriginal (orange chicken, chow mein, egg-drop soup, etc.). Surprisingly, the orange chicken was the best dish. Not too much of the bread coating coupled with moist chicken...Mmmmmm. BBQ had some great roast beef. Medium rare with horseradish!!! The most impressive station had to be the dessert. They had approximately two dozen pies and an assortment of cookies, cakes, and ice cream. HUGE SELECTION! Individual grade: 3.5 stars  Drinks: Champagne served with Sunday brunch. Mimosas were tasty with a minimal amount of pulp. Individual grade: 4 stars.  Recommendation: Definitely try it. Affordable with a large amount of food and great variety.",

Go here when you want the premium Feast Buffet. The last time I visited, gelato was available in the dessert area. They also had salmon, which I had not seen at any of the other Feast Buffet.  Go for a late lunch and have a player's club card to get a few dollars off. The lunch is almost like dinner and it's about $5 dollars less expensive. All of the dishes I have tried over the years were tasty and I especially enjoy the spicy Thai noodles. They always prepare a generous amount of sushi.  The line might be long here during dinner, but definitely worth the time. Enjoy the excellent meat and Asian food sections. I will be going back soon to see what's changed.",

    "text": "I came for lunch today with my husband and toddler before our movie at the Regal Theater at Red Rock and was pleasantly surprised.  We signed up for the \"Boarding Pass\"  upon entering the hotel, so we could get the discount and pay only $6.99 each (drinks included), our toddler was free.  So, the value alone is 5 stars in my book!  We came right around noon on a Monday and waited in line for 30 minutes.  I've waited longer in other buffets on the Strip, so this didn't bother me at all.  The casino is new enough that it still has the clean and fresh feeling- and you don't feel like you are standing in a haze of second hand smoke.   There is definitely something for everyone.  They do not have the buffet staples of crab legs and shrimp cocktail- but they do have chinese, mexican, american, italian, and japanese.  These were just \"OK\" for me.    But, the salad bar is one of the larger ones I have seen with a great selection of fruits, veggies, and potato and macaroni salads.  The dessert selection is also quite plentiful.  They don't have chocolate covered strawberries or fancy looking pastries, but they do have 15 different types of pies, including reduced sugar options. They also have other pastries, cupcakes, eclairs, gelato, soft serve ice cream, and cookies (of which I pocketed a few for a movie snack).    I wouldn't recommend driving out of your way to eat at this buffet, but if you are in the area, checking out a movie, or planning on bowling- then it is DEFINITELY worth it.  Since we live only 15 minutes away and we like the stadium style movie theater- we will definitely be back!",

Lack of sufficient staff meant a longer wait than was necessary. They had quite a few choices but the lines in the food line were long as well. The pre-cooked items were hideous. My eggs Benedict looked good but the egg was rock hard, like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for an hour. The blintzes were inedible. The list goes on.

    "text": "I've been to a few of the Green Valley casinos...while the others target the locals this one could be a special destination for any visitor to las vegas, particularly if you wanna spend some time at the nearby Red Rocks park nearby.  First of all the service was great. Everyone was incredibly nice and they didn't look harried or overworked (which is not to say they don't work damned hard, and we tipped them well for it). Our server came by several times and made sure we had everything we wanted. It was hard to believe we were at this huge buffet place, cos they purveyed intimacy.  For lunch, the first thing I hit (and it was paydirt) was the beef brisket station, which happened to be hauling major ass that day. Maybe it was that particular slab, but it was so tasty, and I've had my share of beef brisket across the loins of Texas, but this one hit the spot. That set the tone for the rest of the lunch, and maybe the fact that it was the first of this week's buffets and it's been awhile I've gone chomp crazy contributed to this otherworldly sensation in my mouth. Fried chicken, buffalo wings, chinese chicken wings, creamed corn, spareribs, mango ice cream and 15 lychees later, I was done. Sure, there were a few misses along the way (the orzo salad, bowtie pesto salad...I mean  do they defrost this or something...that buffet tastelessness syndrome was all over that), but the overall gestalt was that of GOODNESS.  I'm giving 4 stars not because I don't think it deserves 5, but ONLY because I haven't eaten buffet at the heavy hitters (Wynn, Bellagio, etc) and I would imagine spending $40 instead of $10 would result in a 5. (I mean it better damed...right?). But I had a lovely experience here....read it and weep.",

The sushi now only consists of rolls, no more sashimi, they stopped at the beginning of this year, I asked because I was very surprised and then disappointed.  Also, for seafood night, there are NO crab legs, what the frak?  and you call this seafood night?  basically the only seafood is several varieties (i mean differently seasoned), shell your own shrimp, cold clams (decent), and semi dried up fresh oysters.  Seafood night is Friday night.  Desserts are ok.  they have gelato, but now you have to ask the service person there to get  a slice of pie for you.  you can't pick your own anymore.  They also tried making some cupcakes, they are mini, hard, and tasteless.  The only flavoring comes from the sugar of the frosting and sprinkles.    A way better deal is to just give this place a try on a weekday night, at least you still get prime rib, and in the Las Vegas REview Journal (our local las vegas newspaper), there is a coupon for a 2 for 1 buffet at any of the station casino buffets or Fiesta buffets.  If you are only only person, it gives you half off your dinner.  Only downside, is that it is not combinable with the station rewards card to get $2 off your meal for dinner or $1 off for lunch/breakfast.  It is worth the $.75 to get a newspaper to save the $15 for dinner Monday thru Thursday.",

The price is ridiculously cheap and the food can be decent. I've only been here for breakfast and with my parents (since they like it and have lots of comps). Their omelette station is wonderful since you can get something fresh and to your liking (I also like all their fresh vegetable selections). The bacon, Potatoes O'Brien, and corn beef hash tend to be good as well. Nothing is stellar nor consistent in taste, so currently not my choice of dining.

The salad section wasn't on par with other station casinos. The Mexican station the meat was tough and dry and seemed to be out to long.  The sushi had way to much rice and couldn't distinguish one piece from another. The raw shrimp and brisket was delicious. The dessert bar needed more attention on the hot side as alot of trays sat empty. Then a guest lost his dinner all over his chair in front of our table. the security staff was helpful to let us in and out while they tended to him. The buffet manager thanked us for being cooperative with the excitement but everyone in the vicinity should of got a free buffet coupon for dealing with that. They did clean it up quickly I might add. All in all visit boulder or sunset or gvr. Even palace station I would say has a better buffet. Step your game up Red Rock. Bring your players card its only 13.99 .",

The staples are an Asian section, a small Mexican station and an Italian station. There is an American/BBQ station as well. The American station consists of items to make up a thanksgiving dinner type of plate, the turkey is good, but it's just pretty plain. The Asian station is my favorite, the veggie egg rolls are comparative with ones I've had back home in CA, and the egg drop soup is good.  Italian station is pretty gross, the Alfredo is always very very thick (like the texture of mayo - no joke). Mexican station consists of bland rice and beans and some ground beef. The desert station doesn't much of anything; cookies, \"shooters\" some bland brownies and ice cream.  Is the food worth $16 and a tip? Not if you're paying - but if the casino comps it, it's good enough.  Also, don't bother going at all for breakfast - so nasty.",

Had to clarify with the lady signing people up for the Boarding Pass which line I belonged in since I was not a hotel guest, handicapped, a Platinum or Chairman member.  The line situation aside, I had a great time!  From the cashier to the server and food, everything was great!  Even though I had to ask the cashier to add the unlimited beer/wine for me after I paid, she was very nice about it with no attitude whatsoever.   My server, Ryan, was prompt and friendly throughout my nearly 2 hour visit!  My drinks (iced tea and wine) were constantly refilled at my request and dirty plates were whisked away as soon as I pushed them to the opposite end of the table.  Ryan made sure my every need was attended to and that I was satisfied with my visit.  He even offered me coffee with dessert, which I declined.  The food here was pretty good for what I expect from a buffet.  Of course, Gordon Ramsay is not overseeing each dish, but the texture, temperature and taste of the items (salad bar and entree stations) is reasonable for the price.  I have visited many buffets since moving to Las Vegas 7 years ago.  This property provides an exceptional value at a reasonable price!  I especially appreciated the grilled vegetables and GF/Veg/Vegan section since I am vegetarian.  I'll be back again soon and I'll ask for my fabulous server, Ryan!",

Now the selections are bland, unappetizing and so strangely random. The \"international\" section tonight consisted of weird veggie sliders, sweet-potato quesadillas and Green Giant-esque peas and carrots?? Really??   The presentation was really bad as well. Lots of signs that didn't match the food, and about half the food didn't have names at all. Serving pans with burnt residue. Unappealing.  Service was pleasant and friendly. Desserts/Gelato were the highlight. I'm glad they haven't ruined those yet.  2/5 because of how far the quality has diminished in the past year. It used to be 4.5-5 stars and to drop to barely a 3 is disappointment.",

    "text": "Wanna ring in 2015 right for cheap eats?  Do yourself a favor if you already haven't - go to Red Rock Station Hotel & Casino, head over to the rewards center and sign up for a FREE Station Casinos player's card, then mosey on over to the Feast Buffet.  BAM!  World of cheap (but mostly tasty) eats!  I've always heralded the Red Rock as having probably the best food out of all of the Feast Buffets Station Casinos has in Las Vegas.  Eats are plentiful, setting is modernly pretty, and the prices are more than reasonable.  I mean, if the line is long, you really can't be wrong!  I think I'm up to like 13 Yelp check ins here now, how the HELL am I not the Duke of this joint?  I cannot stress enough, this Feast Buffet is no Michelin star, celebrity chef-ridden restaurant.  You won't find your fancy tomahawk ribeye steak here (lookin' at you Bacchanal), or all-you-can-drink beer & wine included (hello Studio B).  But are those fancy buffets only $16.99 for Prime Rib dinner on the weekend?  Don't think so!  Last time I wanted to eat at Caesar's buffet, I think the price went up to my first born, and the rights to a Lakers first-round draft pick.  Absurd!  What kind of silly buffet has a 'Fast Pass' line for an extra $20?  Upon which you still have to wait 2 hours to be seated?  Oi.  And a coupon for a buy one get one free buffet?!  Ha Ha!  Unless you's a balla like Jay-Z and his wifey Beyonce-Z, fat chance.  That's not to say the food at Feast Buffet is total crap.  On many nights...OXTAIL!  Yep, Asian section.  Still one of my favorites.  Also, sushi.  Yep, not the greatest, but at least it's offered.  Pasta?  Get a plate fresh made to your liking!  BBQ Chicken pizza?  Yep, this Feast Buffet has got it.  Cauliflower au gratin?  Check.  Prime Rib on the rare?  Check.  Wedge salad with blue cheese?  Check.  Kim chee?  Check.  Pineapple Fried Rice?  Check.  Kim Chee Pineapple Fried Rice?  Check!  Actually I make that last one by mixing kim chee with the pineapple fried rice.   Tips from my last review of Feast Buffet still remain.  It reigns True here - breakfast at the Feast Buffet here is still the LONGEST line.  You know why?  Bargain, that's why!  Get in before 10:45 AM from M-Sat, pay the breakfast price...but stay for lunch as well!  Two meals in ONE!  Yes, this tip is for you out-of-work, college-broke folks that need some food in your belly.  By using this tip you save $2 off the bat!  But don't forget that Station Casino player's card because on average just showing the card to the cashier will save you $2-$3 a person, $5 for dinner and Sunday brunch.  Use that savings for some slots!  Or some beer!  Locals in the know KNOW that the Feast Buffet in Red Rock (though there are valid arguments for Green Valley Ranch) is the place to take your extended family for a low-fuss, high-quality meal.  Look, the economy today just sucks.  Got relatives coming to town?  They want a Las Vegas buffet?  Got champagne tastes on a beer budget?  And you're expected to foot the bill?  Oh yeah, Feast Buffet here is your best bet!  Take you and your spouse and both get Station Casino player cards.  Use them a few times each over the month.  Next month?  BAM!  Coupon in the mail for each of you, buy one buffet get one FREE.  FREE = GOOD.  Just took care of four people at the buffet for the price of two.  BAM BAM!  Play enough slots and poker to use your points for a free buffet or two?  BAM BAM BAM!  PAY.  SAVE.  EAT.  LOOK LIKE HIGH ROLLER STUD.  You can thank me later.",

    "text": "Wow, the Red Rock buffet has improved a lot recently! I don't know if there's a new food and beverage person in charge, but what a difference! I've eaten at this location many times over the years and the quality had declined over the last year but now all of a sudden, it's back on top. This is one of the better Station Casinos buffets. I usually dine here for dinner so that will be the focus of my review.  The salad bar is extensive and is the best feature of this buffet. There are quality toppings to make your own creation (from crumbled real blue cheese to grilled fresh asparagus) and there are also some really fancy pre-made salads (the roasted vegetable with farro is my favorite). If you dine here and only eat salad, you'll be pleased and will still get your money's worth!  The reason this buffet is tops with me is the abundance of vegetables. Most buffets \"cheap out\" by filling most of their trays with simple carbs like potatoes, fries, rice and the like. Not here. On my most recent visit, I ate curried cauliflower, steamed broccoli, sauteed green beans, Southern collard greens, garlic brussels sprouts, zucchini, roasted peppers, grilled asparagus and more. It is a veggie lover's dream! Vegetarians should find plenty to enjoy here. Meat eaters, you aren't left out either! There are always several carved meats, tacos, pizza, shrimp cocktail, sushi and more.   I'm also a huge fan of their desserts. They have the standard soft serve ice cream machine but there's also a hand-dipped ice cream counter and an extensive sugar free section with delicious sugar free pies (coconut cream, chocolate, cherry, pumpkin, marbled cheesecake and more). Ask at the dessert counter for a fresh slice right out of the case.   The lines here can get outrageous any time of the day, so be prepared to wait. Even the VIP players card and hotel guest lines are long. The staff work as quickly as possible to seat everyone but even with a large dining space, they seem overwhelmed. Prices are reasonable (sign up for a free players card to get a discount) and include non-alcoholic beverages and all food on the buffet (bring cash because the price does not include gratuity).",

I haven't been to too many buffets so I considered this fairly large, but I think the set up is good and the identification of the different food sections like Italian, sushi, American, Asian, desserts, etc., is very clear.  Everything I tried was pretty tasty minus the shrimp, which I though was mushy, and the prime rib was overcooked. Best buffet pizza I've ever had though.  Being that it was my first time I didn't realize mimosas or champagne were included until half way through so that would have been nice if the waiter had given us the head's up on that.  I thought all drinks were extra as they were displayed at the register and also on the menu at our table with prices.  Being that I live so close and the normal price for Sunday brunch is $13.99 I would come back on a non holiday when the service is probably better.  .",

Some of the standouts in my opinion were the fried chicken and the fried shrimp. I can't remember much else. Even though most of the food wasn't memorable, everything seemed hot and fresh and nothing looked unappealing. Buffets always have something for everyone and the buffet here definitely seemed to offer plenty for the locals.

Ok first of all while waiting in line I was looking around and was liking the decor and the seating arrangements the red rock has got to be the best casino for foot traffic. But the people they hire to prepare the food needs improvement. Let's start with the Asian section think of the worst Asian buffet place you have been to. It's still better the stuff they try to call Asian food here. (I'm not the only one who thinks so cause when I sat down to try it my self an Asian couple had left their plates full of the food from the Asian) Now the American food they had macaroni and cheese that I regretted getting the butterfly shrimp they had was ok needed a little ingredient known as salt. Everything their could have used some salt. There was no flavor in anything other than the soft serve ice cream I got. They don't even know how to make Italian food it's really disappointing. I wouldn't give it any stars but the decor and atmosphere give it one star. Red Rock employees if your reading this you need somebody to come and show the people in the Feast how to cook because what they are doing now is insulting. Just because it is a buffet doesn't mean putting out crap is acceptable.",

We live in the north west and have visited the Aliante buffet on a normal night and could see no difference (besides some paltry shrimp) between the two buffets. After waiting in line for 2 hours, while the Red Rock let multiple tables sit empty, we were very dissapointed in the spread. It was the same spread as a normal weekend night only at twice the cost. I wish we would have spent the time to drive to Green Valley Ranch, the only \"locals\" buffet I have actually enjoyed and found worth going back to. For Thanksgiving this buffet was the same price as the Red Rock and I suspect was much closer to gourmet.",

We went for breakfast one Monday morning with some friends that were in town and we all left with full bellies and wallets still intact. Get this folks, a breakfast buffet that isn't just decent-- it's great--for the bargain price of $6.99 per person.  Of course, that's with your player's card, but if you're one of those weirdos that thinks the government is tracking your every move and don't want to give your personal information to those sneaky casinos, you're going to pay a whole dollar more. Yeah, that's $7.99. For a great buffet that includes made to order omelets, mini Belgium waffles complete with maple syrup or berries, all the crispy bacon you can inhale, bagels that you can load with inches of cream cheese or salmon and capers, delectable quiche, fresh fruit galore, pastries that would make the French proud and then some mediocre options like oatmeal and cold cereal.  Bonus: Amazingly, you won't smell smoke while eating OR leave smelling like smoke. Unless of course you spend your time digesting at one of those highly tempting coin-suckers. And even then you can sit in a non-smoking section for your gambling, asthma-attack-free, pleasure. Two words to sum up Red Rock's Feast Buffet for breakfast: LOVE IT!",

Sunday through Thursday, the dinner buffet is $13.99 with the player's card.  Friday nights are $24.99.  Saturday nights are $16.99.  Personally, my favorite meal to eat here is Lunch!  We try to get here either early or late for lunch so that the wait is not longer than 20 minutes.  Still, if the wait was over an hour, it would be worth it to me.  For the price it costs (with a player's card), the Feast Buffet at Red Rock Casino is absolutely the best in Vegas!  Tip:  If you are a dessert lover (like me), then make sure to save room for dessert!  There are so many exceptional choices!  The majority taste just as good as they look!",

The Ambrosia Salad as well as the Sweet & Sour soup are delicious.  Also, the dessert bar offers sugar free and no sugar added pies which I appreciate.  The pizza isn't the best but then who goes to a buffet for the pizza? I love the Red Rock Casino Feast Buffet.",

The 2 stations are fsr feom ewch other. How the crap did this happen?? Ibasked for a manager to let them know what happened, I didn't even ask for anything! Just take them off the line! He goes off with my players card and comes back 15 minutes later and tells me we have 1 free meal Awesome! I wasn't expecting that! Flash forward to 5/21. No free meal when I came in! So he lied about the meal. And never took the potatos off the line. Pretty pathetic when this place is so darn good. I do not recommend it due to its piss poor service.",

I tried the hazelnut. - I really liked this granola/milk/raisins/apples mixture they had at breakfast, as well as the corn bread pudding. Delicious.  OVERALL CONS: - The sushi was horrible. Stale, dry, bad quality seafood. - Pizzas also looked incredibly old and stale and oily. I didn't even touch that.",

They have these different stations where you can go and eat and stare and then eat some more.   The quality of their food: good. some stuff was great-like their strawberry ice cream..and I don't even like ice cream all that much.   What impressed me the most is their big assortment of dessert. They've got everything from red velvet cupcakes, pistachio ice cream, and sweet potato pie to name a few.   When we went to this buffet we must have come at the right time because when we left there was a big line just to get in.   I don't know how those peoples experience went but for us...we were seated quickly, our drinks got refilled rather slowly but surely and we left very very full.",

If one wants to eat healthy, there are choices. For breakfast they have a turkey hash with cubed turkey and potatoes in a broth. I also like the cubed fruit salad and grapefruit slices. If the line is short, omelettes are a good choice to control what you eat. You can ask for egg whites. For lunch, the turkey is usually moist, the sweet potato is flavorful. But I wish they would cut the potatoes in half as the portions are enormous. The Asian section is consistently good; in fact better than most take outs in this town. My niece likes the hot and sour soup because it is not pork based. There are many vegan choices available throughout the day. I like the roasted veggies but wonder what oil is used. The broccoli is usually good but occasionally overcooked. The salad bar has red sliced beets. I try to avoid bread, but the crusty bread is so good and better than most Italian restaurants. For dessert, I usually have chocolate gelato. For diabetics, there are sugar free options. For gluten free options, look online or ask, but it is not readily posted.",

I couldn't find their prices any where until I got to the cashier which was pretty frustrating. Great price but the food wasn't special at all.   Food: 0/5  Like I said, food wasn't special. They had a sushi bar that had your Americanized California rolls or the tuna roll. They had an area for Asian stir fry. Also an Italian area where they had pizza and spaghetti. They also had an American area with a roast and other BBQ & your dinner side dishes. I didn't see much of \"lunch\" in their selection.   Salad bar: 3/5 I really liked their salad bar, it had fresh greens with different salad dressings with a few choice of soups. The only bad part of the salad bar was a lot of their salads were pre dressed and I don't like heavy dressing on my salads so this was upsetting.   Desert: 3/5 The desert bar was pretty good, it had a small variety of pastries but they have quite a big selection of ice creams. I don't like ice cream so I just asked for a chocolate moose pie and had a frozen yogurt ice cream cone.   Service: 5/5 I had a really friendly waitress, she was very sweet to my niece. This place being a buffet I really appreciated how quick the bus boy and waitress would take away our empty dishes. It gave us more room on the table which was much appreciated.",

A lot of the local casino buffets lack variety but I was happy with our selection. As a Christian father of two it is hard to keep my kids happy. If you go to the omelette bar make sure Erica H. is the one cooking for you. She was more than happy to deal with my rowdy kids and also is quick at serving with no issues with my odd requests. You don't usually see this level of service in a Vegas buffet. Especially at a locals casino. I don't write reviews often but I was impressed with pretty much everything about this place that I will for sure be back.   Thanks, you all rock!",

    "text": "I'll say this... and the criticism is based on the potential and legacy...  I get a feeling of a downward spiral of neglect towards pride in competition and wanting to make this better here.  It used to be a strong solid buffet amongst it's peers.  If complacency is the fodder of mediocrity, I feel it's my duty to point out the flaws to ensure Feast Buffet knows they need to keep their eyes on the prize and regain their position as solid buffet in the competitive AYCE world of dining...  I had the Friday Seafood Buffet for $25, and it was pretty far off the mark.  The meat carving station beef was overcooked and a bit dry.  Another example is the Asian station's white Bao bread was clearly sitting for hours, as they were harder than croutons and not soft and fluffy.  They should have removed 'em as an option so people don't get a bad perception, or better yet, replace 'em with new ones.  The seafood itself like the snow crab legs were no better and probably worst than what an AYCE buffet eater would get at a local $9.99 Asian AYCE Buffet as the standard seafood fare.  The other seafood was mainstream stuff (shrimp, etc.)  you always see, so nothing unique.  Not like the Seafood Buffet at The Rio let's say.  With a local 2 for 1 coupon, this would be worth $12.50, but at $25, it's a hard meal to justify paying for.  I / we, didn't have one 'tho.  You can get more bang for you buck either with better quality or a lower price in other restaurants (or even the food court area) in the Red Rock or surrounding area.  The service was friendly but sub-par based only on neglect as opposed to being offensive, as they're seemingly understaffed (or at least that night they were).  In the heyday, The Red Rock was the quintessential place to visit... it was cool, hip and defined swagger.  The pool was where the beautiful people lounged, the Cherry nightclub was hip and hoppin', at night, the crowds were young and sexy.  Now, the Red Rock as a hotel casino is turning a bit more drab and stoggy and not in an upper crust old money or classy way, but in that it (The Red Rock as a whole) seems to no longer appeal to the beautiful people or the trendy movers and shakers anymore.   The buffet used to be a \"go to\" standard of excellence, so I'm not sure if the economy has forced 'em to cut corners or not (thus the locals and their 2 for 1 coupons, so maybe it's priced and formatted assuming most are paying less - - but if you're paying full price it's pretty harsh to justify and they should just lower the price universally and get rid of the coupons if they're looking to bring in tonnage of customers) but I'd like to give 'em another try and have 'em get back a \"*\" or two \"* *\" and earn a high praise recommendation that I used to highly tout about the place.",

The taco with shredded pork was so juicy that when it was picked up the meat fell through the taco. A Cannoli with creme that was dried out like it must have been there all day. However the cold seafood and sushi choices were good and tasty.  The salad bar has a wide selection of fuits and vegetables.

The price is right at $13.99 with a free player's card (note you can't get the card at the buffet so it's $18.99 otherwise). There was a long wait to enter. I could see it wasn't more than half full but still had to wait nearly 30 minutes in line which was quite annoying.  This buffet has good selections of Asian, Mexican, Italian, and Southern food in addition to a decent salad bar and dessert area. The highlights were the roast beef and BBQ ribs. Both were flavorful without being dry and were very fresh. The Asian section was okay and the shrimp n' grits and succotash were worth trying in the southern section. Save a little dessert space as they have a selection of pies and will cut you a slice. I really enjoyed the coconut creme pie.  If I come out to this section of Vegas next trip I'll visit this buffet again so y'all save me some ribs.",

I liked it so much that my friends and I went to celebrate Valentine's day but we were so disappointed at the taste and selection of food.

    "text": "After more bad experience than good, I don't plan on ever going back. The only reason I give two stars is for convenience. Here are two of our worst experiences.   We went one Saturday for the mimosa brunch. After a few mimosa's, our server attempted to 'cut us off!' We had our kids with us & would NEVER get drunk in front of them, we only had 2-3 very week mimosa's per person (in the span of an hour), & if you knew us-we aren't heavy drinkers-at all! It was very insulting. She took it back after we confronted her asking which of us she thought was drunk and merited being 'cut off'? She brought us another, which we left untouched on the table. It should probably be noted that this particular server could not understand the thick accent of one in our party & became very impatient with my friend. (Before the mimosa incident).   We tried Thanksgiving also! Big, big, big mistake! Only if you have a 'high' players card and can bypass the line & you like their mediocre food. Before we started, they said it was a 2-2/12 hour wait. No problem. We knew being Thanksgiving, there would be a wait. We arrived at 10:45 for this reason! The line actually moved pretty good for the first two hours....then it basically stopped!!! The lunch hour hit & all the 'high' players cards started coming in and getting priority! After waiting 2 hours, that added another 2 & 1/2 hour wait! 4 & 1/2 hour wait!!! We were starving. At this point, there was no other place for us to go! Wait time would still be 1-2 hours unless we went to McD's. My dad was here from out of state & it was what he wanted so we stuck it out. I would not have! The food is never that great! I thought thanksgiving would be better. Turkey & a bunch of casseroles!!! Ok...so the turkey was only breast, which you had to wait in another line to get it because they only had one turkey carving station on THANKSGIVING! The sweet potatoes were not cooked (hard as red rock) with a few marshmallows thrown on top & there were really no other traditional casseroles. I was not impressed with the dessert. The pies were made somewhere else & they ran out of whip cream by 5pm. Let's just say.....I'm thankful for the knowledge to never come back!",

Unfortunately, the food was not all as expected but we didn't have much time to even try everything as we were kicked out of our table within the first 30mins. The host asked if we were able to move as they had a big family who just came in and they didn't have room to seat all of them. I asked her kindly, \"if we can finish the food we were eating?\" As we just started eating our second plate. Not even 5 minutes after our waitress comes and asks if we can move. I again had to repeat myself without getting frustrated \"if we could please finish our meals first before we move to a different table. The waitress rudely repeated herself  and asked us if we can move to a different table?\" I then got upset and asked the lady, \"Is it not okay for us to finish our meals before we move?\". In a rude tone the waitress replied, \"sit and forget about it.\" After that my boyfriend and I had both lost our appetites and wanted to leave. The one start is for the kind cashier and the manager who reimbursed us for our meals. Besides that, I will not come back to this buffet.",

    "text": "I have frequented several buffets in town (Aliante, MGM Grand, and now Feast Buffet at Red Rock, and while it is not the worst, it is not the best either.  The food selection is quite vast, but you pay for it.  With the complimentary players club card you do save a few bucks, but make sure to bring your ID to get your club card.  A couple of the highlights from the selection are the spring rolls, the prime rib, and the pork green curry.  Was a little disappointed with the seafood selection, not having king crab legs and all.  I figure if you're going to compete with the likes of the strip or M Casino, I would assume your seafood selection would be top notch.  Either way, it's in a great location near downtown Summerlin and the service was frequent and efficient.",

Going in I knew it wasn't going to be great and my expectations were met with Asian food fitting for Panda Express, flavorless Mexican food, sloppy sushi rolls, bland pasta, and regrettable desserts.  On the plus side, the turkey was really good.  If we have to eat out again for a holiday, I'll have to make sure I choose the location. Sorry mom.",

I came on a Friday night and as you can imagine it was pretty packed which is a good sign of course, and the precursor of what the food might taste like.   Well I managed to get in the buffet, first impressions were that it looked very clean, it was nice and organized and all the food stations looked very professional.  Visually the food look very appetizing especially the protein area with good prime rib, chicken, and other various meats.  I tasted food from the Asian section , the American section, Italian section, and the Mexican section and I have to tell you everything I tasted was very delicious!   I was not disappointed, the price to get in was $19.95 which is not bad for dinner and even better when the food is very delicious.  Before I left I tried the dessert section and the choices they have for dessert we're pretty good with a lot of variety. They also have a nice gelato section which visually looks very good, and fancy and the taste did not disappoint either.  Overall I'm giving this buffet 3.5 stars, it was a very pleasant experience and I will definitely be back in the future.",

    "text": "I will base these reviews on the last two times within a two-week period. I have eaten at the buffet about 30 times in all my years. I left for 5 years for San Diego and just moved back literally a couple of miles from the hotel. I was bragging to my friend how exceptional you were as it was her first time.  Firstly I just want to share that I was a former F&B Director at highly regarded properties in San Diego and La Jolla, California and also a former F&B Director in Las Vegas. I also have held positions as Buffet GM in Las Vegas. So with that being said I wanted to share briefly a few thoughts. First visit.... I have a server who was definitely was past her prime. And I don't mean that in a derogatory fashion. It's just she doesn't understand guest retention and customer attentiveness. Simply it's not her forte any longer. I won't say her name but it started with the letter L as I don't want to cause any embarrassment. Simple requests like asking for additional clean silverware so we wouldn't have to use the same cutlery for all of our courses seem to be a big chore for her. So I'm sorry to say I took your clean silverware off tables that had yet to be sat. I realize it's not protocol but having a non attentive server forced my hand. Immediately when we were about to be seated by a very friendly host person and I believe her name is Mercedes. Kind, gentle, beautiful smile. The server brought drinks to us that we had not ordered so it was no problem. I understand she made an error and delivered them to us by mistake.  I told her and she served them to the adjacent table. I went ahead and I just requested two waters with lemon and her response was, \"I'll be right with you sir I'm putting these drinks on another table.\" Outstanding I told her. We waited for a couple seconds and she looked at me and I repeated my two glasses of water with lemon request. And the service went downhill from there. Did not offer coffee, dirty plates stacked,  just a poor service experience. On a good note I've always been impressed with your food. I won't list all the items but I can tell there's attentiveness by the chefs. The only drawback is half the buffet line is missing their food identification menu badges. I asked one gentleman in the adjacent seafood section what the item was and he didn't know and shrugged his shoulders. But the good team member he was he asked the adjacent line attendant in Seafood and she came over and told me they were Vegetarian Sliders. Because I'm passionate and want your Buffet to be first rate I just wanted to share the positives and the concerns I had with the current F&B Director.  I called the day after and left a message on a voicemail that was not identifying himself as the Director. But that was the extension PBX connected me to. I waited a few days and heard nothing back. I then called and left a message for the property GM at his assistants line and just stated if he wanted to discuss my experience to please call me back. But I've heard nothing and that's okay. So I figured I would just put some of this in writing to let them know how they're doing.   Second visit today was superb only with a couple flaws. Mercedes as a host person again phenomenal and Rebecca as my server was the difference between night and day. God bless her. Brought another friend who had tickets to the complimentary Buffet and concert event in Rock's Lounge and we were looking forward to that. Again, the overall food was magnificent and thank you chefs for your efforts. Only two concerns. Again not having food labels to identify sauces and particular items I believe is inexcusable. And it's even exists on your salad station. The Buffet Manager needs to understand this is not okay. It just comes with being thorough and a perfectionist for presentation. Secondly Seafood station attendant was replacing the sushi on the back half of the Sushi Boat where people could not reach it. And he just watched them struggle with short tongs. I tried and struggled. The next lady gave up and I asked him to push the sushi to the front of the boat when replacing. He said nothing but moved it. I went back 15 minutes later and he still was doing the same thing and I took photos. He just didn't care that your Buffet guest were struggling with the process and I was frustrated even though I'm not in the business anymore. Other than that I will return. I will tell my friends how magnificent your food is and I sure hope I get Rebecca again because I will request her. And if I just may offer a personal opinion. If your Buffet GM reads this may I  recommend a suggestion for his or her next pre-service meeting?  No matter how beautiful your property is and how magnificent your food is people usually don't return if service is poor. Sophisticated people don't take a chance on poor service. That's what they will remember and that's what should be emphasized during your meeting...but that's me.  Thank you for taking the time.",

The salads and breads, the pre-course foods, are located somewhere in the middle. I normally never get mac salad anywhere, but I decided to try it and it was surprisingly good. Forgive me but I don't really remember the names of any of the food I got besides the obvious salmon & mashed potatoes & such. The dessert bar isn't as good as places like bacchanal or the M, but it's decent.   I've been to a lot of buffets in town and I wouldn't put this one in my top 3, but they're not bad at all. This is located outside of the strip so it's really convenient! Nobody wants to deal with all that traffic.",

And even that might be giving too much credit.   There was absolutely nothing great about any of the options here!  I don't know what I was expecting,  but this buffet was boring!  The meats were dry.  The sushi tasted old.  The pizza tasted like it was lil Caesars.  Panda express has way better Asian food than this place.  The desserts were minimal hospital grade stuff.  I promise you can get the same quality food at an Arizona Charlies buffet,   and you'll save a lot of cash.    We have two receipts, because the cashier rang up one person less than we told her.  As a result when we went to go get seated, we were told we didn't pay for everyone in our party.  So we had to walk back to the cashier, and pay again.  We told them the first time exactly how many people were in our party . Their mistake, not ours.    Anywhoo......go to the Yard House in the casino or somewhere else.  Don't waste your money in this buffet",

It's right inside of the gorgeous Red Rock Casino. We saved a few bucks by signing up for the rewards program and headed inside. While a server takes your order for drinks. It's up to you to decide how full your plate will be. We got there during breakfast time. I had already been piling foods like Country fried steak. Then bacon, which I was sad to see it was thin brittle pieces. I believe the fat was cut off and it is made to be crunchy. Which isn't for me at all. Eggs were next, unfortunately for me I scooped watery and soggy eggs onto my plate. My guess is I grabbed too close to the bottom of the dish. But that was ok, I changed it for Eggs Benedict , and it was the best. Various other breakfast foods were added and we ate that. Then something super lucky happened. When we inside still eating, they switched over to lunch! Now we were getting two meals for one. I could have Sushi, pizza, grilled food items and more. So I did, the only bad thing I grabbed was grilled eggplant. It needed to be grilled in thin slices not a whole half. It was icky, wet, and tasted bitter. Everything else (especially dessert) was amazing.",

You can tell that the ingredients they are using are mediocre.  Meats were tough and under seasoned.  None of Asian fares were done right, all the desserts were terrible.  This is fancy looking place in a luxury casino with pretty terrible quality selection of foods.  The only thing they did right was hummus and quinoa salad.  Skip here.  Find much better buffet on the strip.  Wynn is always great.",

    "text": "Knew they were trying to offer some VEGAN items so we went to check it out again.  It was a little confusing as the there is a sign that indicates vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and dairy free.  But right under the sign we're some black bean quesadillas so I had to ask which items were supposed to be vegan.  Not the quesadillas, lol.  Kevin was the cook on duty and he very nicely explained each item and the types of oil used or even coconut milk in the whipped sweet potatoes!  They were great.  I had 5 or 6 small dishes in addition to a little hummus and pita.  Vegetable kabobs, curry vegetables, a rice dish, and fiesta corn were all vegan.    My main suggestions to improve are to label individual items as vegan so people like me don't have to pester Kevin.  There was also a quinoa salad on the salad bar that could use a sign if vegan- otherwise I have to ask somebody or just not eat.    Finally, there are a ton of vegan desserts in the world but none on the buffet.  Red Rock would be great to offer at least one - even if it was just a coconut ice cream or something.",

For $26.99 that's not too shabby of a price to pay compared to the higher end places on the strip that charge $45 per person.   I wasn't too fond of the prime rib or anything else. The sushi wasn't bad for a buffet, but it's just buffet stuff.   They offer steamed crab, and also iced crab. I was super stoked about their crab action.",

Granted, it comes with unlimited mimosas, but I don't drink and they don't offer a cheaper, alcohol-free option.  The food quality is mediocre at best. Most of the Asian/international foods are off in some way or another. For example, they serve \"fresh\" kim chi. Huh? Kim chi, by definition, is fermented cabbage that's at least a few months old. Also, the sushi is completely inedible.   At first glance, it seems like a wealth of variety of food, but on closer inspection, much of that food is unappetizing or poorly prepared. And the majority of it is prepackaged foodservice fare. If you're going for sheer gluttony and don't care about the quality of what you're shoveling down your throat, this is the place for you. Personally, life is too short for crappy food so I'm crossing Red Rock off the list.",

The prices are amazing for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. My mom and I received coupons in the mail, so I think we went for dinner for around $12 each. An incredible deal.  The Feast Buffet deserves a 5/5 for price, decor, and service. Compared to the over $60 dinner meal at Bacchanal, this is such a steal. The line to get in at around 5:15 PM on a weekday was about twenty minutes long, but it does move pretty fast. Variety is pretty equal to other buffets I've been to. You have a salad bar, pizza, Italian, Chinese, American, etc. However, most of the food isn't labeled, so just beware.   The food probably was the worst part. Most of the things I tried I didn't even finish. The sushi tasted really old, the fried foods were way overfried, the dessert was subpar. Some of the meats were too tough. The dessert was subpar. There's a large variety of pastries, pies, and gelato, but the pistachio gelato was pretty gross.   I'm not from the Vegas area, but if I ever go back, I probably won't come here for dinner!",

If you have the membership card I believe the prices around $25 per person and I know if you don't it's five dollars more but don't quote me on the price. I'm not sure what the price would be for the regular dinner.  The buffet is nothing extraordinary but I'm going to base my review on the prime rib since that was the main highlight of this buffet. I think the prime rib was pretty good however it was slightly salty on the crust but once you get to the middle part that it was really tender.  also it seems like it is on the more medium rare side so if you want it to be a little bit more cooked well you just have to tell them and they can do that for you.  Dessert was fairly good and they have a pretty good selection of pies and gelatos but other buffets in Las Vegas areas are pretty similar as well",

We came here for brunch last weekend and found that they incorporated a \"Well & Being\" section with food offerings dedicated to vegan, vegetarian, gluten friendly, and dairy free diets! The lady in front of me in line pulled the chef aside to ask him if the pancakes were gluten free. When he said \"absolutely\" she smiled and said it was the best thing she had heard all day.   I had the vegetarian Polenta and Eggs Benedict, Egg White Sopes, and some sort of root vegetable quesadilla. Many dishes were being cooked right behind the buffet line showing how fresh it really is (unlike other buffets with their mystery food in trays from the back). With the fruit, soup, and salad bar, as a Vegetarian, I definitely got my money's worth.   My husband made his own steak and eggs by ordering two easy eggs and put in over a giant top round steak. He was content with his creation.   With Station Casino player's cards you get two-for-one offers here about 6 times a year on the mail.   Did I mention the free champagne on weekends?!",

My boyfriend brought up his phone because this was the reason we chose to go to this buffet.

I can't rave about their buffet though. You can't expect too much for the boarding pass price. Sometimes they'll send locals coupons for dining too. If I had to pay the full price, I probably would pass on this Feast Buffet. I've posted prices and hours as a picture. It's no Bacchanal people. It's alright quality food, and you won't find many dishes that will amaze you. It gets the job done if you are hungry, and there is plenty to try and many options for picky eaters. My boyfriend complained that all the breakfast items did taste pretty much the same, but we weren't surprised. I have yet to try their seafood dinners on Sundays.",

Very basic but it does the job! For station casinos and for the price, I'm very much satisfied. So if you're ever on a budget and needed to show off a little extra Vegas flare, this is the place to go.   The service is always on point here. I've never had issues with any server taking too long to grab my drinks. For the amount of traffic, that is quite impressive. But waiting in line to get in is a bit annoying. There's always a line so don't come here super hungry. Always plan ahead!   Also, get a casino players card to get the discounts! I promise it would be worth it.",

The price is very reasonable for all you can eat. I suggest you get the players card which is free and knocks a couple of dollars off the buffet for you. With the players card this buffet becomes one of the cheapest buffets that rivals the quality of many of the strip buffets. The only place is clean and well kept, I never get that dirty feeling eating the food that I sometimes do at cheap buffets and the dining area is very pretty. Service is usually a tad slow with drink orders, but that's not the end of the world to me. Keep doing you, Red Rock.  I've tried both brunch and dinner buffets here and both are fantastic. The brunch buffets serve all of your typical breakfast items such a waffles, french toast, and pancakes. The pancakes are a little lackluster, but the waffles and french toast are great. Their bacon is delicious here, perfectly cooked where it's crispy but not overcooked and salty. Scrambled eggs were fluffy and the corned beef hash was delicious. Blintzes and benedicts were decent. Overall I got my fill with the breakfast items and was more than satisfied. Many of the other lunch items I tried I'll cover for the dinner portion.  The dinner, surprisingly, is my favored meal at this buffet and that's rare because breakfast always wins for me. Their Asian food is pretty tasty. General Tso's chicken with a tasty not overly sweet flavor. Their Chinese vegetables are fresh and have a nice light flavor. Pot stickers were good and so was the wonton soup.   The comfort food is where I'm at though. Mashed sweet potato (so good!), meat loaf (my favorite thing here), stuffing, and the fried shrimp. Dear lord was that good. It just hit every note I wanted it to. The meat loaf has a good flavor (almost like something a mom would make for dinner), the stuffing was delicious and just slightly dry, the fried shrimp was perfectly crunchy and with some cocktail sauce is great. Top the meatloaf and stuffing off with a little bit of gravy and put some cranberry sauce on the side; you've got yourself a plate full of comfort.   Special shout out to the fried fish which was crunchy and tasty and went well with the tartar sauce provided. Their pizza, excellent. Probably the second best buffet pizza I've had and the buffalo chicken one opened up my eyes to a new pizza topping. They have a little vegetarian nook that has varying veggie burgers and curries (spinach and chickpea curry, yum).  The dessert area, while not fancy like Bacchanal, has a lot of options including cookies, any pie you can think of, donuts, cakes, gelato, bread pudding, and I think I saw a chocolate lava cake once. My personal favorite are the donuts, one of which is a small typical looking pink frosted donut (the type with a whole in the middle) that was filled with jelly throughout the ring.",

I receive the 2 for 1 coupon from Red Rock Casino in the mail usually once a month which is nice to use! My roommate and I take turns buying the one buffet for 9 dollars! Feast Buffet is a good deal even when you don't have the coupon!   The food is also pretty good! They have a decent amount of vegetarian and vegan options! Even a lot for people who are gluten free. My roommate is vegan and gluten free while I'm just vegetarian and she gets just as much out of the buffet as me! They have constantly put out the same lunch buffet each time. Today was exceptionally good though! The flavors were right, everything was fres",

The food tasted fresh and not like its been left out nor all greasy.  Overall I would go again if I was close by.",

The carving station had  chicken turkey pork beef and sausage.  The beef was medium rare and tender.  The cooked vegetables were crisp not mushy.  I didn't eat any desserts, but they looked heavenly.

In my specific case, my party paid at 8pm, but due to POOR management and organization, they let us in at 850pm. It was too late to leave coz we were fully paid and we just hoped and prayed we would get in the buffet area already.   All we were able to eat was the pasta, a cup of soup and scraps of veggies and meat. Additionally, the lady servers in the dessert bar made the situation even worse than it already was. The asian lady in the pie area wouldn't tell you what pies she had left even when you asked. She just gave me a blank stare as if she didn't understand what i was saying. On the other hand, the hispanic older lady in the gelatto bar wouldn't give us creme brulees even if she just gave this other man 5pcs! I asked if i can have one and she said she was out. SHE WASN'T! I saw she had so many left behind her station!   The only thing i liked about this place was the lady making the pasta. She was really nice and the pasta she whipped up for me was delicious!

Let me just say the prime ribs was simply fantastic as it is carve for you that can be seared on request. Tender like how it should be done full of flavor that could put Lawry's to shame. Yes, I said it cause I had Lawry's $50 cut the last time I was in Vegas which my Mom has stated as the best she ever had like ever and can't stop raving about it when discussing such topics. Well Mom, this one just tops it for me :) Sorry I didn't have any actual images because I was too busy stuffing my face with prime ribs at this buffet in Red Rock.   For breakfast, they will make your omelette any way you like it. Nothing new there as many other buffets in Vegas casinos offer the same service. Just tip a buck if you do have it made as you wait a bit cause I saw 80% of those waiting did which is the right thing to do!  Along with the omelette, I like the baked ham which they will carve for you, bacon and small size waffles the most. And don't forget to save some room for the gelato in many flavors at the dessert station.   The waiter was attentive in accommodating our drinks for breakfast despite how busy it was. Overall, it's one of the best buffet I had in Vegas!",

Bottom line if you want to eat like a slob for cheap and dont mind 3/10 quality food eat here.",

They took us to the  sitting area across from the Asian food section. When we tried to seat in the front ( the area was empty) the hostess Jessica told me that the area was closed. So instead we had to sit in the back.  Needless to say my mother was upset. I will never go back. They can keep it closed forever.",

They have since discontinued that and while the prime rib is decent they are definitely not worth the cab ride from the strip. We brought up with management and their response was that this is not what their website advertises while they still tout the top ten status.",

Because Red Rock is part of Stations my expectations weren't too high (I know I know, I probably shouldn't think that way), but my overall experience was very good. We arrived around 5pm before the rush & by the time we left (probably around 7) there was a decent sized line. Our waitress kept checking up on us & our table was never full of old plates. There's also a complimentary glass of wine. My favorite were these scallops on an oyster (I might be wrong) shell that were AMAZING, I kept going back for more.   Will I be back?! Heck yeah! Only if I have an offer though. Maybe next time I'll try their breakfast or lunch.",

They have a nice flow of things and the servers are usually always awesome.  Pros: Breakfast  Price isnt too bad In Red Rock Nice selection Choc croissants Yogurt mixed with red grapes : )  Cons: You pay FULL PRICE for kids older than 3! Food is sometimes dry Sometimes the selection is crappy  Ive gone for breakfast and lunch, I have to say I really like the breakfast! Usually buffets are a hit and miss with me mainly bc I dont eat like a fat pig and Im picky. I love that you can have any drink for free, non alcoholic of course. I also really love the omelet bar! Its great when you get a nice fresh perfectly cooked one! I always tip the guy making it! Poor dude, hes busting ace trying to make 100 omelets. They offer your standard fair: eggs, bacon, sausage, country fried steak, biscuits, gravy, eggs benny, and on occasions burritos.  Lunch is about the same, burgers, wieners, Asian stuff, Mexican stuff, a carving station, and other yummies.  Here they also have a huge salad/fruit bar that is sooo fresh and delish, and they also have a grandiose sweets area. It includes gelato and sugar free options.  Here its not a bad price, 4.99$ for brekkie and 7.99$ for lunch with your players card. What I dont like is that I have to pay full price for my 6 year old son. Why am I going to pay the same price as a grown man would?",

Desserts were definitely horrible though, everything was stale and flavorless. So as long as you don't want good desserts, this great is a great option to save money on a good dinner!",

This place is clean, service is courteous, food is good (come at the right time), and I like the set up--it's well spread out for a buffet. Salad bar is damn good, breakfast is bomb, lunch is bomb also, and their dessert is pretty good too.   Cons: It's not that big, so not much selections compared to other casino buffets. BUT for $8.95 I'm cool with that!   Ill definitely come back, MIGHT even be my go to buffet spot. ;)   If you plan on coming, be sure you don't get here late bc quality won't be there.",

Not only are they cold and irritable at the cash register but I couldn't believe my eyes when one of the food servers didn't have the patience to wait for an elderly man who was getting steamed carrots. She pulled the tray of carrots out while he was still reaching for them with the tongs so she could replace the tray with a new tray of hush puppies. (Yes she saw him) The carrots from the poor man's tongs spilled out everywhere, some into a tray of stew.  This was the most disrespectful thing I have ever seen in all my dining experience. It's strange to me how they put so much effort into putting out decent food but they put no thought whatsoever into the character and attitude of their staff. For me, a general darkening of the mood by rude service people makes going back unthinkable.",

    "text": "The buffet is decently priced.  There is a great selection of foods, but the quality was a-okay.  The sushi section only had a few types of sushi.  The rice was pressed too firm and just fell apart after the first bite.  We were really looking forward to the desserts section, but it was a disappointment.  The gelato was almost melted by the time I ate it.  After eating at the buffet two days straight, we had to pass the next day.",

    "text": "Sunday night, my wife and I went to our favorite local buffet...the Feast at Red Rocks. As always, the food was very good, the service fair, great variety, and the  presentation was excellent. They now have cordon bleu which was really good, even though it was not labeled and many people didn't seem to know what it was. And my wife just loved the very nicedly grilled salmon. But this review is not about the food, its about the extremely long wait lines.  Though you would expect long waits on a Sunday evening, the experience did  not have to be quite so difficult.  We got on line about 6:00 and paid about 6:30.  Then the line just stopped with practically no movement.  We seemed to mill around in that small area for the longest time. It was about 7:10 when we finally got seated.  The seating process was chaotic, to say the least. One lady seemed to be running the whole show and she appeared overwhelmed.  The most bothersome thing was that it was obvious that there were many open tables ... they just weren't cleared so they sat empty. I asked a manager about this.  He said that they had a large tour group come in and they had to assign a good part of the wait staff to this group. Couldn't management prepare for this and put on some additional staff? The people immediately behind us in the line didn't want to wait so they turned around and returned their ticket.  Really, I love Red Rocks and would like to keep going, but I would hope for a more pleasureable experience the next time.",

Service from Oliver was great. The price is right and the dessert section is very nice (all the pies you want, and icecream)",
